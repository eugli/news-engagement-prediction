Scientists are constantly monitoring the ice shelves for any changes – increase or decrease – in the percentage of ice. \nGliding 250 kilometres above the Earth, looks like astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) are keeping a close eye on it. \nFrench astronaut Thomas Pesquet shared a gorgeous, yet haunting photograph of the Antarctica’s Larsen ice shelf, which displays definitive signs of ice loss. \nPesquet wrote: “Mosaic-looking pic of Antarctica’s Larsen Ice Shelf shows signs of being one of the fastest-warming places on Earth.” \nHave a look!
