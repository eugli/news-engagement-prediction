His remarks, brief as they were, contained an elaboration on the \"America first\" theme he sounded at Inauguration Day.\n\"It's time to bring a clear-eyed focus to foreign affairs, to take a fresh look at the world around us, and to seek new solutions grounded in very ancient truths,\" Trump said before Vice President Mike Pence swore Tillerson into office.\nThose three truths are that \"[1] Nations have a right to protect their interests; [2] that all people have a right to freely pursue their own destiny and [3] that all of us are better off when we act in concert, and not in conflict. And there's rarely been conflict like we have in the world today — very sad.\"\nSubscribe today to get intelligence and analysis on defense and national security issues in your Inbox each weekday morning from veteran journalists Jamie McIntyre and Jacqueline Klimas.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

Those maxims built on the declaration, made in Trump's inaugural address, that \"a new vision\" would guide his administration. \"We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first,\" he said during the speech.\n\"We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow.\"\nTillerson kept brief his first remarks as the nation's top diplomat, after thanking Trump and the team that helped him prepare for the confirmation.\n\"I've also received an enormous outpouring of wonderful messages from people all over the country whom I do not know,\" Tillerson said.\n\"And it's their messages that are really going to stand in steadfast reminder to me as I enter the responsibilities of secretary of state, that as I serve this president, I serve their interests and will always represent the American people at all times.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Fiery riots roil UC Berkeley after Milo arrives on campus \nViolent protests erupted at the University of California at Berkeley on Wednesday evening after an event featuring an alt right speaker was canceled due to safety concerns after more than 1,000 people showed up outside the campus venue.\nBreitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos was scheduled to address 500 attendees on behalf of the school's Republican club.\n\"Of paramount importance this evening was the campus's commitment to ensure the safety and security of those attending the event, the speaker, those who came to engage in lawful protest, as well as members of the public and the Berkeley campus community,\" the university said in a statement released two hours before the event was slated to begin.\nBy Anna Giaritelli • 02/01/17 11:04 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:24:22.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
