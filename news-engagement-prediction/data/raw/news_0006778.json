God knows what they think will be left. \nThe offending incident was a few contestants on I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here admiring the physique of male model Kris Smith and introducing the immortal phrase “He might have an elephant donger!” into lounge rooms across the country. \nThe complaint was that this comment was only allowed because it was made by a female contestant. And yes, granted, if Steve Price had complimented Kris Smith’s donger it certainly would have raised a few eyebrows. \nBut the major gripe is that men leering at women is deemed creepy while women leering at men is just fun and games. (The minor gripe, I suspect, is that none of us look like Kris Smith.) \nCertainly they have a point. Anyone who doesn’t think there’s a double standard between male and female behaviour has obviously never been married. But, as anyone who’s been married also knows, some things just aren’t worth the fight. \nThe simple rule is that chicks are allowed to perv on blokes but blokes aren’t allowed to perv on chicks. That’s why God invented tinted windows. \nSo for all those blokes whingeing about it, can I say: Please, just harden up. And I realise what a dangerous expression that is in this context. \nThe truth is the Aussie sausage has had a proud place in the nation’s media ever since Jack Thompson’s johnson first escaped the staples in the original Cleo centrefold. We’ve had to censor the essentials here but let us assure you, his cup runneth over. Source: Supplied \nAnd if history has taught us anything it’s that there is no more natural home for knobs than on reality TV. \nFor proof, one need look no further than Big Brother’s “Hotdogs”, who became a media phenomenon in 2005 simply by pulling his weiner out on national television. The network liked it so much they gave him his own show. \nBut of course we all walk in the footsteps of giants, and Hotdogs would never have learnt his craft had it not been for the pioneering work of Warwick Capper, whose contribution to Celebrity Big Brother in 2002 is seared into the national memory. It was this raw natural talent that secured him that prized Up-Late Game Show hosting gig. Source: Supplied Somebody buy this man a belt.

RIP Gordon.

We’re all dirty pervs in the end. Sure, we blokes may have to hide our furtive glances at the army of cleavages we confront every day but let’s face it, we always find a way. If you really want to land a man on the moon all you have to do is tell him there’s a pair of naked breasts on it. \nAnd if picnicking ladies want to titter about a gentleman’s packed lunch, then what is the harm? It sure beats talking about feelings. \nSo let’s lighten up Australia. There’s no need for the schlong goodbye. \nAfter all, as my wife’s always telling me, why make such a fuss over such a little thing?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:06:32.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
