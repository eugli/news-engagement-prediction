Sivasangari, who delivered winning point as Malaysia beat Singapore 4-2 in the final of the SEA Cup at the Sarawak Squash Centre yesterday. \nWith the score 3-2 in Malaysia’s favour, the world No. 99 stepped up to the plate to deliver an 11-6, 11-13, 11-7, 11-6 win over Mao Shi Hui in the second women’s singles for the winning point. \n“I’m happy to have been given a chance to win this for the team ... considering I was a late replacement,” said Kah Yan. \n“I was a little frustrated with myself in the second set and lost focus. \n“But I bounced back well in the third and fourth sets ... I’m glad I played well.” \nMalaysia, the 2015 champions, had earlier got off to a cracking start when world No. 55 Rachel Arnold hammered S. Sneha 11-8, 11-3, 11-9 in the first women’s singles tie for a 1-0 lead. \nReigning world junior champion Ng Eain Yow quickly doubled the lead for Malaysia when he thrashed Pang Ka Hoe 11-8, 11-4, 11-6 in the first men’s singles tie. \nSingapore, however, threw themselves a lifeline when their women’s pair of Au Yeong Wai Yhann-Mao Shi Hui stunned Malaysia’s Nazihah Hanis-Chan Yiwen 8-11, 11-7, 11-10. \nThat was the first point Malaysia had dropped in this year’s mixed team event. \nBut the Sarawak combination of Marcus Sim-Sanjay Singh Chal restored Malaysia’s two-point advantage by beating Ka Hoe-Timothy Leong 11-8, 11-2 for a 3-1 lead. \nUndaunted, Singapore fought back again with Ka Hoe-Shi Hui beating national juniors Ong Sai Hung-Lai Wen Li 11-3, 11-5 in the mixed doubles tie. \nThen came Kah Yan’s heroics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:23:52.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
