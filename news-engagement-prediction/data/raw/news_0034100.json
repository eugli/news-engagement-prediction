This pattern reminds me of the lead up to the Iran deal, and probably features the same cast of characters.” \nGutfeld said that what President Trump has failed to do so far is figure out who the big Obama loyalists are, come down hard on them, and “get back to policy.” \nHe also pointed out that the Flynn scandal seems worse than the past because the media wasn’t as fiercely “nipping at the heels” of President Obama as they are now with Trump. \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:56:52.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
