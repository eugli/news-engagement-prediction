The police later added that they may need to summon him for a second round of questioning. \n“Mr. Lee has been booked for a charge of driving without a license, but he may be summoned for further investigation for other incidents that occurred during the random stop.” \n– Police Staff \nTV Report was able to reach out to Yoon Hyuk and interview him regarding the violation. On February 6, Yoon Hyuk confirmed that he had indeed been charged for driving without a license. \nHe, however, explained that he had told the police he did not have his license on him at the time of being pulled over, and that he hadn’t presented his older brother’s license, contradictory to previous reports. \n“At first I was so scared so I gave the police officer my older brother’s name. But immediately after I told him my real name and confessed that I didn’t have a driver’s license. I never gave him my brother’s license. That never happened.” \n– Yoon Hyuk of DECEMBER \nTo compensate for his violation, Yoon Hyuk decided that he would not be appearing on television, and instead, will dedicate much of his time on self-discipline and self-reflection. \n“I will not be appearing on television for a while; instead, I will take time to reflect and discipline myself. I will focus solely on music. I am deeply sorry to all those who love me and have faith in me. I bow my head in apology to all my fans. I will strive to become the Yoon Hyuk who can compensate for this with my music. I apologize again for causing an inconvenience as a public figure.” \n– Yoon Hyuk Of December ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:45:19.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
