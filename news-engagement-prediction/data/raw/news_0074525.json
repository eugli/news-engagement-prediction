A team of eight firefighters arrived at the apartment complex at around 12.20pm Monday after receiving a distress call from the year-old boy’s mother 10 minutes earlier. Shah Alam Fire and Rescue station operations chief Noor Fazida Tina Mohamad Noor said the mother and passers-by had been trying to open the door for 15 minutes before making the emergency call. She said the mother was about to send her seven-year-old son to school and had brought the toddler along with her. “She sat the toddler in the front passenger seat and closed the door behind her. \"She was about to open the driver's side door when the car’s automatic lock was activated,” she added. Noor Fazida said the mother was not able to do anything because she had left her keys and wallet on the driver’s seat. She was frantic when help arrived. “The toddler was crying when we reached the scene. We played peek-a-boo with him through the window to calm him down. “He responded to us and stopped crying. We used some tools to pry the door open, and slid a wire through the gap. “We hooked the wire to the keys and fished them out. The process took about 20 minutes,” she said. Noor Fazida said the child was still shaken when he was brought out of the car, but his health was not affected by the ordeal. “I took his pulse after we had rescued him. His heart was beating fast because he had been crying for a long time in the car. But he is still in normal condition. “I advised his mother to take him to a clinic as soon possible as he showed symptoms of fever. “He could be traumatised by the incident,” she said. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T16:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:41:26.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
