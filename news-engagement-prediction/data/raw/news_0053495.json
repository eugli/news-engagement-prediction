Hindustan Times via Getty Images ADVERTISEMENT \nWhen Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor had a baby boy, they decided to name him Taimur Ali Khan. \nHowever, being a country that is easily offended by matters that don't even concern us, the couple was viciously trolled for naming their son, Taimur. \nEveryone collectively assumed that the Khans had named their son after the Turco-Mongol ruler, Timur, who invaded India and vowed to plunder it. \nSaif later clarified that his son's name is Taimur and not Timur which has nothing to do with the ruler. Taimur means Iron, he said . \nSo while one would think that the couple couldn't care less about the online vitriol that came their way, it turns out that is far from the truth. \nIn an interview with Delhi Times , Saif Ali Khan has revealed that for a couple of weeks, he was contemplating changing his son's name. Saif Ali Khan \nWhile he gave it thought, his wife was not up for it. \nHe said, \"Kareena was a little against it and she said, 'People respect you for your opinion and you can't'... So I said, yeah, but it's not about people. I don't want him to get unpopular. And I still might, maybe when he's one or two, I might change his name in a while, it's still sinking in, what to do.\" \nThe actor said that a PR person from his team also agreed with the idea of changing Taimur's name. But Saif decided to drop the idea for now as when he the note they drafted, it sounded 'terrible.' \n\"It was so pathetic that I canceled the idea. Because it was really like, uhh, 'I'm sorry', and 'I didn't want to offend' and 'I'm an idiot' (laughs), and you know, I've given in to pressure. It just sounded awful.\" \nWell, Saif, if you do end up changing the name, that's exactly what it would mean. \nAlso see on HuffPost: Best Celebrity Baby Names Of 2015 Best Celebrity Baby Names Of 2015 1 13 Share this slide:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:12:05.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
