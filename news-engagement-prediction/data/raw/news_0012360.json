The flight made an emergency landing at Iqaluit Airport, where the sole runway usually accommodates much smaller aircraft, Daily Mail reports. The town mayor quickly arranged for the passengers to take a tour of the city, where temperatures hovered around minus six degrees Fahrenheit, but they ended up staying on the plane until a replacement arrived hours later from New York. Swiss International Flight 40 suffered a 'technical irregularity' and made an emergency landing in Iqaluit at around 3pm local time, according to Canada's National Post. In a video of the plane, filmed by Brian Tattuinee, the Boeing 777 appears disproportionately large as it descends onto the snowy tarmac. The airport director John Hawkins told the National Post: \"The real issue was they only had one engine, but despite that it was a smooth landing.\" Leroy Sanchez, a singer songwriter based in Los Angeles, was on the flight and tweeted that he was 'in the middle of the North Pole.'
