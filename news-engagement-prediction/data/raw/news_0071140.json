It probably features some kind of crisp beverage, your favourite girl gang, some spa action and a whole lot of grinding to Empire State Of Mind, right? Now imagine that Oprah, Mindy Kaling and Reese Witherspoon are there with you. Or, rather, you are on holiday (well, technically a work trip) with the three women mentioned above. All of whom are currently living their best lives/your dream holiday in New Zealand. \nThe trio are in NZ to film to shoot the Disney film A Wrinkle In Time near Lake Hawea in beautiful Wanaka, and according to Stuff they've been trying the delicious local cuisine, chatting with locals and hitting the D floor at a cocktail bar called Gin and Raspberry (we want to go to there). SHARE Squad goals. Photo: Instagram/@oprah \nAccording to a woman called Kim Knight who got to dance around her handbag at the bar with OPRAH, Oprah was \" incredibly warm and humble.\" This is a lot to take-in, we know. FOMO is real and when it relates to Oprah it is brutal. \nAs balm for the fact that we're not in the hot tub with the trio talking about other famous women that we all know (not bitching, just out of concern) and fixing the problems with all men/the entire world (it's about having empathy for others, ask Oprah), or singing TLC's No Scrubs with our arms out the window or making promises that we will all come back every year no matter what's happening in our lives, we've taken a deep dive into the trio's holiday snaps. \nFor there are lessons that we can all learn from them on how to have the perfect girl's trip. \nWish we were there!

A post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) on Feb 16, 2017 at 11:12am PST \nAnd obviously there should be all of the wine. Drinking it in a winery makes it extra acceptable to drink before noon. A post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) on Feb 18, 2017 at 11:39pm PST \nPartake in some gentle and highly Instagrammable exercise, because of balance. And also to get a little 'me time' in away from the gang. A post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) on Feb 21, 2017 at 12:23pm PST \nYou must try all of the local cuisine. Biscuits definitely count. A post shared by Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) on Feb 21, 2017 at 12:35am PST \nTake loads of selfies for memories/Instagram. A post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) on Feb 17, 2017 at 7:32pm PST \nThere should be some element of nature involved, in between the general gallivanting/wine tasting. A post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) on Feb 21, 2017 at 12:45am PST \nIn every friendship group there is always a queen bee. Best to acknowledge this and not resist. (Oprah is queen bee. Obviously). A post shared by Oprah (@oprah) on Feb 14, 2017 at 8:04am PST \nRoad trips are a must. Power anthems/Beyonce essential. A post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) on Feb 20, 2017 at 12:08am PST \nThe bedrock of any successful girl's trip is one that involves copious amounts of cold drinks in a hot body of water. A post shared by Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) on Feb 17, 2017 at 10:41pm PST \nAlways remember to take a moment to be present and appreciate where you are, and the people that you're with. Girl gangs are the BEST.
