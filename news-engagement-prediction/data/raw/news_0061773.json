Alameda currently has around $36 million in a general checking account at Wells Fargo for operating expenses, with an additional $325,000 in a workers compensation account. The city disclosed those figures in a quarterly investment report in January. Alameda currently has around $36 million in a general checking account at Wells Fargo.… more Christopher Dilts | Bloomberg Now, however, the city wants to pull it monies out of the bank entirely, citing Wells Fargo's role in financing the 1,172-mile Dakota Access pipeline, as well as its headline-grabbing banking scandal after being fined for aggressive and illegal sales tactics. “If there is bad behavior and we do nothing about it, then we are passively condoning it,” Vice Mayor Malia Vella said at the meeting. Vella and Councilman Jim Oddie put the matter before the City Council, which voted on it Wednesday morning. Oddie noted that he believes removing the funds puts Alameda in line with an existing policy, which prohibits the city from \"doing business with any company involved in the coal industry.\" The San Francisco-based bank continues to grapple with the fake accounts scandal, which produced over 2 million bogus accounts without customers' knowledge. The bank said it has fired 5,300 people. It paid a record $185 million fine and has clawed back compensation from its CEO and former retail banking head. \"Along with telling city officials to begin the process to secure a new bank, the council also wants the city to refrain from investing in Wells Fargo securities for three years,\" the East Bay Times reports. \"A request for proposals, a first step toward finding a new bank, should be ready for the council to consider in about six weeks.\" Other California cities which have begun divesting from Wells Fargo include Davis and Santa Monica, as well as the University of California system. Bank spokesman Ruben Pulido sent the following statement when asked for comment: “Wells Fargo is one of 17 different financial institutions financing the Dakota pipeline,” the statement reads. “Our loan represents less than 5 percent of the total funding. We have also banked the Standing Rock Sioux and some 200 other Native American Tribes across the country. In fact, we have met with the Standing Rock Sioux leadership a number of times, including earlier in February, in order to better understand their concerns. We have also met with Energy Transfer Partners to share the tribe’s concerns and to emphasize the need for both sides to reach a positive and peaceful resolution.” Riley covers breaking news and oversees all digital content.
