T-Mobile CEO John Legere ‏said the company will offer customers two lines for $100 , all taxes and fees included.\nThis marks the latest in an escalating price war between the nation's wireless carriers. You may remember Verizon over the weekend brought back its unlimited talk, text and data plan for $80 per month for the first line when you select automatic payments. Customers can add up to four more lines for $45 a month.\nAT&T, meanwhile, offers an unlimited plan if you subscribe to its U-Verse or DirecTV subscription video service.\nAT&T and Verizon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:27:20.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
