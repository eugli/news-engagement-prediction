Read more \nHelping people to live safely and independently at home, or in a homely setting, has been recognised as not only having positive outcomes for individuals but also able to save other parts of the public service considerable costs.\nBut the proposed cap means there could be a substantial gap between the LHA rate available to eligible tenants through universal credit and housing benefit and the actual cost of tenants’ supported housing, due to the higher costs, such as enhanced housing management, higher turnover levels, additional safety equipment and staff costs. \nOur research has revealed that some tenants in supported housing could face a shortfall of between £50 to £440 a month. This has caused considerable uncertainty for tenants of supported housing as well as providers whose business would quickly be undermined by such substantial arrears. Many providers have been reluctant to invest in any further provision of supported housing, as the business model currently used would not be available going forward. \nIn March 2016, after lobbying by a range of organisations, including the SFHA, the UK vovernment announced that people living in supported housing would be exempt from the LHA cap for a year in order to allow it to carry out a strategic review of how supported housing is funded. \nThen, in September 2016, it announced details of how supported housing could be funded in the future . The key elements of that proposal included:\nthe LHA cap will apply to all tenants in supported housing from April 2019 – not just those who took up tenancies after 1 April 2016. housing costs will continue to be paid through the benefit system up to LHA level under-35s will not be subjected to Shared Accommodation Rate in supported housing a ‘top-up fund’ will be made available to pay the difference between core housing costs and the rest of the supported housing costs; this top-up fund will be devolved to the Scottish Government the possibility of a different system for short-term transitional services The newly proposed 2019 introduction date means there is under two years to develop details of how the fund will be distributed, operated and administered. \nThis timescale is under even more pressure in the devolved nations, as these arrangements will need to be consulted on by devolved governments and assemblies before the changes are implemented. This seems highly optimistic at best, reckless at worse.\nThe government needs to urgently rethink its supported housing policy | Dawn Foster Read more \nWe have called on the government to lengthen the proposed timescales for these changes and allow. adequate dialogue to ensure that any changes that are made work well for tenants and providers alike. We also back calls to pilot any changes to understand and learn from unintended consequences. \nThe UK government has said it is listening. For the sake of many vulnerable tenants in supported housing across the UK, and those who might need supported housing in the future, we hope that is true.\nZhan McIntyre is policy lead at the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and gave evidence on 21 February to the Commons select committee inquiry into the funding changes for supported housing. \nHousing Network Communities Benefits Social housing Public services policy Renting property comment   Share   Reuse this content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:30:10.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
