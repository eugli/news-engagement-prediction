(Reuters Photo) \nIran’s top diplomat has congratulated director Asghar Farhadi for winning the Oscar in the best foreign language category with his film “the Salesman.” \nMohammad Javad Zarif said on Monday the prize is a move against President Donald Trump’s executive order barring U.S. entry to citizens from seven majority Muslim countries, including Iran.
