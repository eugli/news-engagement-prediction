At open point, he remarked, “I’m not really that anti-gay”. \nIn front of two Sydney Morning Herald journalists, who were in the room, he called the paper the “Sydney Morning Homosexual”. \n“Trigger warning for the Herald , there are some heterosexuals in this room. I don’t want you to be offended by that, but there are some males who are attracted to females in this room,” Mr Cameron said. \n“Now, I know, the NSW division of the Liberal Party is basically a gay club. I don’t mind that most of our parliamentary class is gay. I just wish, like Hadrian, they’d build a damn wall. That would be my preference.” Australian Liberty Alliance candidate, Kirralie Smith.
