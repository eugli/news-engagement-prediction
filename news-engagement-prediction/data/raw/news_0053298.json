Statistics from a Tourism and Events Queensland local government area profile in 2015, show Chinese tourists were the highest international visitors that year. While the Gold Coast (pictured) was ranked fourth most popular for Chinese tourists, the most popular city was Phuket, followed by Seoul and Bangkok There were 197,000 Chinese tourists to the Gold Coast in 2015 who stayed a combined 989,000 nights, an average of about five nights each. The second most popular were tourists from New Zealand with 174,000 visits, followed by 58,000 UK tourists. Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate has visited China on numerous occasions in the past five years and said the country had a strong appetite for the Gold Coast. Chinese tourists also favoured the Gold Coast more than New York City (pictured). 197,000 Chinese tourists visited the Gold Coast in 2015 and stayed a combined 989,000 nights - an average of about five nights each 'I am not surprised by the remarkable figures coming out of China because we have worked heavily to promote the idea that the Gold Coast is just 'one sleep' from mainland China, so far as direct flights go,' he said. Direct flights have begun from Hong Kong and Wuhan to the Gold Coast in the past two years, with others also connecting to Brisbane. The survey was done by Chinese travel company Ctrip and the results were announced on Tuesday night at the Destination of the Year Awards in Shanghai.
