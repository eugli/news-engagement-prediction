The underwater thriller with a war setting to it was a new experience for the audience, as far as an Indian film is concerned. That said, one just wishes that there was much larger awareness on a pan-India basis. Still, the fact also remains that the appreciation it has received has helped it put together some numbers. This reflected in the weekend numbers of 7 crore* for the Hindi version.
