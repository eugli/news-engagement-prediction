Otherwise, I think the average person will get bored/frustrated and not follow through. They’ll give up sooner than later and turn miserable.” \nTry These Moves \nThese are Dunn’s go-to exercises: If you’re still streamlining your routine, opt for bodyweight workouts . “You need to be able to move your own weight first before thinking about adding additional resistance,” he says. \nLooking to melt fat? Bust through those burpees, he says. (Here are 25 burpee variations to get you started.) For upper-body strength, Dunn loves a good push up . \nPractice Patience \nIf you’ve hit a weight loss plateau or your muscle growth has stalled, give it some more time. Fitness isn’t a race, it’s a journey, says Dunn. \n“(People) don’t see visible results in the first month, so they quit. Most people train for summer/vacation. Great, whatever motivates you—but you should aim for a healthy lifestyle not a 10-day trip on the beach,” he says. “Also, (people) believe they can look like someone on TV, and when they don’t, they give up. Keep everything true and realistic.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:08:58.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
