(Michael Tercha / Chicago Tribune) Nick Kindelsperger , Chicago's iconic chocolate mint brand. Once the product of the late Marshall Field 's, the locally beloved department store, the mints were acquired a few years ago by Macy's, which will forever be known as a New York intruder.\nNow that Frango has been liberated from the clutches of the outside interloper and brought back to our fair city, we can celebrate in the only way that makes any sense: by mashing up the two beloved icons into one dish. \nAs you can imagine, this began as something of a joke. Both Garrett's Popcorn and Frango Mints taste perfectly good on their own and certainly don't need each other for support. But we couldn't help ourselves. \nWhat if we melted the mints down to a sauce and then drizzled them over a bowl of Garrett Mix (a mix of the CaramelCrisp and CheeseCorn flavors)? There was only one way to find out. \nIn our test kitchen, we carefully melted mints in a double broiler until they coalesced into a shiny, spoonable sauce. Then we drizzled it over a bowl full of the popcorn. That was it. We didn't add anything else. \nMuch to our surprise, the combination works. The refreshing fragrance of mint hits your nose first, before you taste the creamy chocolate. That's followed by the crunch of the popcorn. Though some were concerned cheese and mint wouldn't play nicely together, the saltiness of the cheese provided a fascinating contrast to the sweet chocolate sauce. Garrett-Frango mashup Michael Tercha / Chicago Tribune \nWe used Garrett Mix, of course, the caramel and cheese local favorite, and original flavor Frango Mints, of course. Trying this at home? Give the chocolate time to set up, on the counter or in the fridge or freezer. \nWe used Garrett Mix, of course, the caramel and cheese local favorite, and original flavor Frango Mints, of course.

(Michael Tercha / Chicago Tribune) \nYou can definitely dig in the moment the chocolate sauce hits the popcorn, though your fingers will soon be covered in a sheen of chocolate. A less messy option is to drizzle on the chocolate and then stash the bowl in the freezer for 30 minutes. That way you'll be able to dig into this ridiculous mashup without looking as if you've dunked your hands in a vat of melted chocolate. \nGarrett Popcorn, if you're listening, you should definitely consider making this. And if you could please send the recipe development check to the Tribune office, that'd be appreciated. \nnkindelsperger@chicagotribune.com \n\n\nFirst, we found the best hot chocolate in Chicago .
