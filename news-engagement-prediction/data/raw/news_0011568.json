On Friday the Aslef rail union paved the way for the end of the strikes that have caused such misery. At the heart of the dispute has been the potential for new technology to make public services more efficient: Aslef has rightly accepted that technology allows train drivers to fill the roles that conductors used to play , for example by operating doors (as they have on the Docklands Light Railway since 1987).\nNot every union agrees. Mick Cash, the outspoken general secretary of the RMT, called the decision a “shocking and historical betrayal”. But the tide of history is not on Mr Cash’s side, for the issues at stake have implications far beyond the rail industry.\nWatch | Why are Southern rail striking? 01:30 L ast month, while commuters suffered, Jeremy Hunt announced that the NHS will work with three artificial intelligence (AI) companies to deliver health advice over the telephone in London, Yorkshire and the West Midlands. AI is improving to the level that it can understand complex areas such as medical diagnosis as well as humans can.\nMeanwhile, HMRC has been able to reduce its administrative staff by a third over the past decade, with great savings to the taxpayer, thanks to its online self-assessment service. Crucially, this also means a better service: completing tax returns on the internet may not yet be exactly a joy, but it is still a huge advance on previous days of paper returns and letters lost in the post.\nMy think tank, Reform, has just finished a study which suggests the wider public sector can follow suit. Automation will replace up to nine in 10 of the Whitehall’s 140,000 administrative roles in the next decade, saving £2.7 billion a year. Similar changes in the NHS could save a further £1.7 billion. When the national debt remains twice as high as its level before the financial crisis – and still rising – these efficiencies are essential. Yet the real benefit will come from a shift in the culture of the public sector away from the bureaucracy that citizens find so frustrating.\nProbability of automation chart F or example: because of the ability to book appointments online, some GP surgeries now run on a ratio of one receptionist to five GPs (compared to the standard ratio of 1:1). This saves money, but most importantly it frees patients from the struggle to get through to a surgery on the phone at 8.30am before all the appointments are gone. In a world of price comparison and pre-booked delivery slots, why should anyone stand for that?\n\nMinisters have wisely accepted that", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:21:26.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
