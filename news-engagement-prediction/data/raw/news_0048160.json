They felt vulnerable and threatened. \n“The initial information we received was that a warning shot [was fired] but when the picture cleared, it turned out it was for effect [meaning it was intended to hit the target].” \nAnother officer told Aftonbladet: “The police were cornered between the stone throwers and their car and shot towards the stone thrower but missed.” \nIn addition to the police being attacked, emergency services had their hands full as 10 cars were set alight in Rinkeby. \nNo suspects have been arrested after the clashes, however officers are treating the incident as a riot and assault on police.
