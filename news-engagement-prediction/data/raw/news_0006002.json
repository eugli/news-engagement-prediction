(Photo: AP) \nBUCHAREST — Large-scale protests erupted in Romania's capital Wednesday after the government adopted a last-minute executive order that undermines the country's anti-corruption efforts. \nThe measure decriminalizes abuses of office if the financial damage involved is less than less than $48,000. \nJustice Minister Florin Iordache said the changes — which take effect immediately — were necessary to bring the law in line with decisions by the country's Constitutional Court. But protesters were furious that the order could weaken efforts to stamp out bribery in one of Europe's poorest nations. It all but legalizes graft cases where small amounts of cash are used. Shouting “thieves,” \"rats\" and telling politicians “You won’t escape,” an estimated 15,000 people demanded the resignation of the government as they surrounded buildings in the capital. Wednesday's protest followed one that brought tens of thousands of Romanians across the country onto the streets Sunday in anticipation of the order. \n\"It is unacceptable, it is intolerable,” said Gheorghe Ion, 49, protesting in subzero temperatures. Ion said corruption is a legacy of the country's communist past. \n\"I have been participating in anti-communist protests since 1989 — it is abnormal that after 27 years I am still here ... This is the drama of my generation.\" \nThe protesters are particularly incensed that dozens of high-profile Romanian politicians, including the leader of the ruling party, Liviu Dragnea, will benefit from the new order. Liviu went on trial Tuesday on charges that include promoting the abuse of office — charges worth about $26,000. He has already been convicted of electoral fraud. \nIordache also announced that a separate executive order, pardoning those who have committed past offenses covered under the order, will be sent to parliament. That means that hundreds of politicians convicted in corruption over the past few years will likely be set free. \nThe order bypasses parliament. \nIt was initiated by Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu of the Social Democrat Party, considered the successor of the former communist party in Romania. \nIt brought immediate criticism from the country's president, Klaus Iohannis, who has a largely figurehead role but was nevertheless elected in 2014 on an anti-corruption platform. \n\"It is a day of mourning for the rule of law … and for the fight against corruption,\" he said. \nAccording to Romania's National Anti-corruption Directorate (DNA), the main institution here that deals with high-level corruption and which is seen as a standard-bearer for Eastern European countries which continue to grapple with the issue, the order will have a detrimental impact on its work, impacting hundreds of cases. \nBetween 2014 and 2016, the DNA has prosecuted 1,171 people and 34 organizations and companies for abuse of office, with losses due to corruption estimated at more than a billion dollars. Currently, the DNA is working on 2,151 cases of abuse of office. \n\"Maintaining the effort of the judicial institutions addressing high-level corruption remains the most important sign of consolidating the fight against corruption,” the European Union said in a report on Romania's judicial system published last week. \nRomania is ranked No. 48 on Transparency International's 2016 corruption gauge, above Cuba but below Jordan. The United States is No. 19 on the index. \nFor the young in Romania, that fight is about their future. \n“Some say that the young don’t' know what we are protesting against,\" said Dan Minel Stoica, a 21 years old musician in Bucharest. \"But we feel when graft happens, this is against our principles and a strike against (the type of) country we would like to live in.\" CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jUtq1r NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.
