The girls had gone hiking in Indiana \nSearch parties scoured the base of the bridge, known locally as the Monon High Bridge, and surrounding trails Monday night, but darkness made it nearly impossible, Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby said. \nRiley declined to disclose who found the bodies. \nDelphi Police Chief Steve Mullins said the discovery of the bodies and search for the girls has shocked the community about 60 miles northwest of Indianapolis. \n‘I know it’s had a terrible effect on our people and we are grieved this sort of thing would happen here in our community,’ Mullins told the news conference.
