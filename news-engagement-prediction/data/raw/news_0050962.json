(DAVID ANDERSON) \nThe act includes a requirement for Americans to purchase health insurance, if they do not get it through an employer or other federally-subsidized programs such as Medicare and Medicaid . Young people can stay on their parents' health plans until age 26; the federal government has provided billions of dollars to the states, including Maryland, to fund an expansion of Medicaid coverage for low-income residents; people can purchase individual plans and take advantage of tax credits and federal subsidies to get lower premiums, plus people who have pre-existing health conditions cannot be denied coverage. \n\"Coverage prevents the burden of financially devastating medical care,\" said panelist Sue Ehlenberger, a lead navigator with Maryland Health Connection, the state's health insurance marketplace. \nEhlenberger works for Seedco, a \"connector entity\" for Maryland Health Connection that serves residents of Harford County and the Upper Eastern Shore. \nShe stressed later that she was not speaking as a representative of Maryland Health Connection or Seedco, but as a private citizen \"sharing my knowledge.\" \nOther panelists included Jeananne Sciabarra, executive director of the nonprofit Consumer Health First , Katia Callan, a Towson-based psychotherapist who lives in Fallston, and Scot Hurley, of Havre de Grace-based Ashley Addiction Treatment. Hurley is the organization's major gifts officer, who specializes in development and communications. \nHe spoke about the deadly epidemic of heroin and opioid addiction that has gripped Harford County, as well as the rest of Maryland and the nation, in recent years, and how most people who could get inpatient treatment through Ashley before Obamacare were wealthy.

The family's health plan allows her to afford expensive medical equipment for her children, though.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:28:06.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
