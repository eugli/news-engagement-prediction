When the street lights come on you better be in this house. You have to wonder just what's going on on this vacation. Fortunately, we received a leaked copy of Barack Obama's island diary. It's written on a palm leaf in margarita salt. This man is really relaxed. 7:00 am I've decided to turn the baseball cap backwards myself. I had thought of waiting for a stylist to arrive to do it for me. I don't want to look like a rube. Is there a particular vertical angle I should be going for? And how about horizontal? Am I going for a Will Smith as the Fresh Prince thing? Are the '90s back? Are the '60s back? Am I back? Should I go back? I received a text from Joe last night. It was just three dots. I thought he was typing for the better part of an hour but I think he's just mad. Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below He's being dramatic. I understand. He understands. I can't go back, yet. And so it's hard. It's hard for everyone. This late age of the world's experience had bred in them all, all men and women, a well of tears. I think go for 45 degree on the Y-axis with the hat. Yes, that's cool. 7:15 am Do I have to not be president for the rest of my life? Maybe I can play George Washington in Hamilton for a while. I think I'll teach myself the fiddle. 7:30 am The fiddle is too ironic an instrument for me to be playing at this time in our nation's history. 8:00 am FRUIT LOOP FRENCH TOAST FOR BREAKFAST! I am so excited! Michelle even had some! I teased her about it and she responded, \"It has the word fruit in it.\" She's so clever. She's been spending a lot of time on the phone with her friend Olivia. I don't know an Olivia. She's also taken to wearing a lot more white than I've seen her in and when she made dinner reservations last night, she turned to me and barked \"It's handled.\" GIF I'm not sure what's going on but I like it. 9:00 am I went for a walk on the beach. This whole place is beach. It's an island. I get it. I'm from Hawaii. But this place is so much smaller. You can't escape the ocean, which is both great and terrifying. My signal strength hasn't been the best so I haven't been able to check the news, which I know is good for my mental clarity. Sometimes I just stare out over the waves and watch them roll in and then out and then in, the perpetual otherworldly motion, the depthless expanse lending a sense of a calm while also cementing the idea that every bit of life is dangerous. Most Popular LOL, I had one too many mimosas! I'm going to take a nap. 1:00 pm GIF 2:00 pm We have a surprise visitor! We heard the rattle of helicopter blades in the distance as we sat down to a late lunch. Michelle spotted it growing larger on the horizon. She looked at me. We didn't say anything but we both were thinking it: They've come to bring me back. The American people have had enough. I turned my baseball cap forward. The helicopter touched down and out stepped John McCain. I nearly fell over.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T19:22:43.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
