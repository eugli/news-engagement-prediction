Well take a look at the above video. \nThe clip, which is a couple of years old, features the England striker in his favourite Chinese restaurant, Wing's, the setting of his 26th birthday party. \nIn the video, Rooney wishes his friends in China a Happy New Year, has a go at speaking the language, and takes part in the world's longest - and probably most awkward - handshake. \nFootballers and celebrities are regulars at Wing's, where the cheapest banquet is £34.90 a head. \nThe owner Wing Shing Chu, from Hong Kong, is famously discreet. Fancy a kick-about? Rooney is staying at the Old Trafford club (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nFormer Red Devils manager Louis van Gaal often dined there, following a tradition started by Sir Alex Ferguson. \nWhen United signed China international Dong Fangzhuo, Mr Wing was brought in to translate. \nMario Balotelli ordered takeaways to be delivered to his home 25 miles away. \nAnd Ashley Cole went to Wing’s to celebrate Cheryl's 25th birthday during their time together. poll loading Is Rooney right to stay at Manchester United? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:12:15.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
