He picks the kids up in the morning and we do stuff all together. The kids need to see you getting along and not just fighting. We do birthday dinners together and if there are days we don’t have stuff to do, we may take them to the movies together.” \nCredit: VH1 \nShe also says she’s simply too busy to give Peter, or any other man for that matter, the time of day right now. \n“I have so much going on. As much as I’d like to date, it’s not easiest thing. When I do get out I like to go things I like to do, with my girlfriends. I’ve never been a serial dater and I won’t start now. I’m staying true to myself.” \nCredit: Instagram \nThe author also claims she is NOT pregnant by the 50-year-old playboy, whose current wife Amina Buddafly gave birth to his tenth child, Bronx Pankey , this season. \n\nWhen one internet troll accused the mother of trying to trap Peter with another baby, she clapped back saying people shouldn’t believe everything they hear. \nA post shared by Fameolous Entertainment (@fameolousent_) on Feb 22, 2017 at 12:02pm PST \nPeter realized Tara was the one he wanted shortly after Amina gave birth, asking for another chance with his girlfriend of 13 years. She initially told him no, and appears to be sticking to her guns. \nStill, the Bronx rapper is a determined man, and only time will tell if she’s able to resist his charms for long. \nFeb 21, 2017 at 4:15pm PST \nDo you think these two will start dating again? Sound off below. \n\nThe Love & Hip Hop Reunion airs Monday at 8 p.m. ET on VH1. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint ’s coverage of Love & Hip Hop below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:05:46.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
