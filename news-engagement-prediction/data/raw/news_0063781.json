There are several mines in the world that have for long been popular tourist attractions. Here's a glimpse at them. Wieliczka Salt Mine, Poland \nThis salt mine is one of the oldest enterprises in the world that began production back in the 13th century and had been in operation until recently. Besides being a top tourist attraction in Poland, the mine also featured in UNESCO's first list of world heritage sites. Also known as 'Poland's Underground Salt Cathedral', the mine offers a tour through 22 chambers, including chapels, statues and chandeliers carved out of rock salt by miners over centuries.
