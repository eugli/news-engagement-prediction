Our teams are working to get this restored.\" \nBarclays added : \"Technical issues are affecting some digital services. We're investigating this and apologise for any inconvenience.\" \nThe problems come months after thousands of Barclays customers in the north of the UK had payments wrongly taken from their accounts. \nLast October, Barclays said customers were refunded after they had duplicate debit card payments taken. \nMany Barclays customers have tweeted about problems using their cards when out shopping or trying to access online banking on Saturday afternoon. \n\"Wondered why my card was declined when paying for lunch. Barclays servers have crashed. Brilliant,\" said one customer, James.
