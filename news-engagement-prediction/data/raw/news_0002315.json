The resolutions give Congress the ability to check regulatory overreach, especially those such as the Stream Protection Rule that was enacted in the waning days of the Obama administration. The resolutions of disapproval are sanctioned under the Clinton-era Congressional Review Act.\nThe second resolution of disapproval would repeal regulations requiring oil producers to report their dealings with foreign governments to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThat resolution, which passed 235-187, would rescind the so-called \"foreign-corrupt rule\" or its technical name, \"Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers.\"\nThe rule was vacated by a federal appeals court in 2013 but was re-proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2016.\nThe rule is part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act that was passed into law after the 2008 economic crisis. A number of industries have fought many of the reporting requirements under the law.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Modest pay hike for Medicare Advantage plans Payments would rise an average of 0.25 percent for plans in the private healthcare program.\nBy Paige Winfield Cunningham • 02/01/17 5:01 PM The American Petroleum Institute, which fought the rule and won in court, said the regulation would cost the industry $96 million to $591 million annually. That breaks down to between $225,000 and $1.4 million annually per company, according to the oil industry group.\nThe oil group and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed suit against the rule in 2012.\nTop Story President Trump attends return of Navy SEAL killed in Yemen \nPresident Trump and his daughter Ivanka departed the White House for Dover Air Force Base in Delaware Wednesday afternoon to witness the arrival of Chief Petty Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens, who was killed during an intelligence gathering raid in Yemen last weekend.\nOwens, a member of the Navy's SEAL Team Six, was killed in a clandestine raid at an al Qaeda facility that Trump had authorized early Sunday morning. The operation left four additional U.S. service members wounded and marked the first military fatality under the new administration.\nTrump, who was to be joined by Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., upon arriving at Dover, had a \"very somber and lengthy\" conversation with Owens' family on Tuesday.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 02/01/17 3:38 PM Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:16:35.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
