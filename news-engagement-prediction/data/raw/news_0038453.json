Abbott tells NFL to back off from threats over 'bathroom bill' 1 / 13 Back to Gallery \nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott is showing no signs of backing down from threats by the NFL that passage of a so-called \"bathroom bill\" requiring people to use public restrooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate could mean no more Super Bowls for the Lone Star State. \nOn Feb. 11, Abbott posted a Twitter message that compared the threat to the NFL's decision to bench New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. \"It ended with the NFL handing the Super Bowl trophy to Brady,\" he tweeted. \nOn Tuesday, the Republican governor set a similar tone during an interview on The Glenn Beck Program. \nPUSH BACK: Celebrities, artists tell Texas to drop 'bathroom bill,' other anti-LGBTQ proposals \n\"The NFL is walking on thin ice right here. The NFL needs to concentrate on playing football and get the heck out of politics,\" Abbott said, according to a transcript of the show. \nHe said it was \"unacceptable\" for some \"low level NFL adviser\" to dictate what measures Texas elected officials should approve. \nHouston Chronicle Sports writer John McClain and KPRC Sports Director Randy McIlvoy look ahead at how well the Super Bowl LI went and how we bring more big events to NRG and Houston. Media: MediaOS Video \n\"We don't care what the NFL thinks -- and certainly what their political policies are -- because they are not a political arm of the state of Texas or the United States of America,\" Abbott said. \"They need to learn their place in the United States -- which is to govern football, not politics.\" \nAbbott offered a possible compromise, saying the NFL could install transgender-friendly bathrooms themselves if they were so inclined. But, in the end, the governor reminded Beck that he sued the federal government 31 times because of what he thought was its overreach. \nWARNING: NFL issues statement on Texas' controversial bathroom bill \n\"Who is the NFL thinking they can tell Texas what to do politically?\" he asked, according to the transcript. \nHouston hosted the most recent Super Bowl, and Dallas played host at its new stadium in 2011. The NFL has selected Super Bowl sites through 2021, none of which are in Texas. \nA league spokesman said last week, \"If a proposal that is discriminatory or inconsistent with our values were to become law there, that would certainly be a factor considered when thinking about awarding future events.\" \nThe Texas measure is similar to a North Carolina law that prompted the NCAA to pull seven championship events from that state last year.
