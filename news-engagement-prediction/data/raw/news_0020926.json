The three-time Oscar winner last appeared in the little-seen 2010 James L. Brooks comedy How Do You Know. The star last made a Nicholson-like splash onscreen alongside Morgan Freeman in director Rob Reiner's 2007 hit The Bucket List . \nJack Nicholson famously starred in 'The Shining,' directed by Stanley Kubrick. (Photo: AP) \nThe source tells USA TODAY that Nicholson was a \"huge fan of the original\" Toni Erdmann and approached Paramount Pictures chairman and CEO Brad Grey. The studio is in the process of finding a director and screenwriter for the project, with no start date or release date set. \nToni Erdmann, a 2016 Cannes International Film Festival standout, is up for best foreign language film at the Feb. 26 Academy Awards. The film stars Peter Simonischek as a prank-pulling father who tries to reconnect with his corporate workaholic daughter (Sandra Hüller) by posing as a life coach for her company's CEO. \nIn an earlier interview with USA TODAY, Toni Erdmann director Maren Ade declined to weigh in on which stars she thought could play the roles if there were an American remake. \n\"I cannot participate in that,\" Ade said. \"That's like introducing someone that's going to be my new father or my new husband. ... We'll see what happens.\" \nContributing: Patrick Ryan \nSandra Hüller, left, and Peter Simonischek star in the original 'Toni Erdmann.'
