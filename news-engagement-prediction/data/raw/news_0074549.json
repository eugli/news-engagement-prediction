Drivers interviewed, usually after they climbed out of their mangled cars, said the addition of the segments — worth up to 11 points each — were a factor in the eight cautions as 15 cars were forced from the field. \n“It’s got everybody a little more amped up, but there are not a whole lot of cars finishing,” said Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series rookie Ty Dillon, who was consumed in a crash on Lap 142. “ It’s just part of racing here at Daytona. That is why it is one of the toughest races to win.” \nMORE DAYTONA 500: Dale Earnhardt Jr. crashes out of NASCAR return at Daytona 500 \nFormer winners Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jimmie Johnson, Matt Kenseth and Jamie McMurray were among the drivers forced out Sunday. \nThere were no yellow flags, however, over the final 43 laps, making it the first time in at least a decade there wasn’t at least one caution within the final 12 laps of a finish. \n“We had a lot of young drivers up front, which was neat to see,” NASCAR Executive Vice President and Chief Racing Development Officer Steve O’Donnell said.. “You saw they could hold their own with a lot of aggressive driving as well. It was certainly surprising at the end to see that many green flag laps.” \nPHOTOS: Best of the 2017 Daytona 500 \nThe lack of cautions, something crew chiefs have come to rely on here, turned it into a gas mileage race as Chase Elliott, Kyle Larson and Paul Menard — all contending for the lead late — ran out of fuel, allowing Kurt Busch to win his first Daytona 500 in 17 attempts. \nThe five-minute clock for pit-road repairs and the ban on cars returning to the track after a trip to the garage to fix race damage also made its debut. Busch, whose No. 41 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford, was part of a 17-car crash at Lap 129 just made it back out on the track before the countdown expired. \n“It’s going to be work in progress as we go (with) NASCAR working with the race teams,” O’Donnell said. “If it goes beyond five minutes, their day is over anyway. If we had a line of teams here saying we have to do something, maybe we’d do something. We didn’t have one of them. “ \nFollow Perez on Twitter @byajperez CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.
