Jefferson Somera, civil military officer of the Army’s 54th Infantry Battalion, said government troops recovered three laptop computers, a power generator set, bullets for AK 47 and M-16 rifles, grenades, supposed explosive devices, and the rebels’ personal belongings from the camp in Namal village. \nThe Philippine Army occupied the abandoned camp hours after engaging suspected members of the NPA Nona Del Rosario Command at 6 p.m. on Sunday . The firefight lasted for about an hour. ADVERTISEMENT \nSgt. Virgilio Miguel suffered a slight injury to his left knee during the conflict but was in stable condition, Somera said. \nLt. Col. Nicolas Quemado, Jr., 54th IB commander, said a number of the NPA rebels were injured in the gun battle, but the Philippine Daily Inquirer has not been able to verify this account. \n“We are appealing to the rebels to help us help their wounded comrades. They can leave their wounded members in the community for them to be evacuated by helicopters (for medical treatment),” he said. \nThe rebels supposedly retreated towards the forested areas of Mount Capan.
