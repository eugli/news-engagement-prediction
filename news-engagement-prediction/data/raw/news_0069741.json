Earlier this month, the 28-year-old became the first cricketer to hit a double century in four consecutive Test series and his team posted 600-plus totals in three consecutive tests, another first.\nThat middle order bat Karun Nair had to be dropped in the one-off Test against Bangladesh despite scoring a triple century in the previous match against England is another indication of the team's batting might. \nBag of tricks \nWhen India bowl, Ravichandran Ashwin has done with the ball what Kohli has done with the bat. \nThe off-spinner, currently the top ranked test bowler, has been in the form of his life, becoming the quickest to the 250-wicket club after achieving the feat in just 45 Tests. \nThe off-spinner with his bag of tricks will torment Smith and his men, often bowling relentlessly in tandem with spin partner Ravindra Jadeja, with a shoal of fielders hanging around the blade. \nSmith is aware of the challenge that awaits Australia, who have lost nine consecutive Test matches in Asia. \n\"We know it's going to be difficult,\" he said. \"India are a very good team, particularly in there home conditions here. We have prepared very well.\" \nCricket Australia recruited ex-England spinner Monty Panesar and former India left-arm spinning all-rounder Sridharan Sriram to work with their slow bowlers. \nSmith will rely more on the pace duo of Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, who would have to generate enough reverse swing to be effective on relatively docile Indian tracks.= \nThe visitors can also take heart from the fact that three of the four matches will be played on new venues -- Pune, Ranchi and Dharamsala -- which will negate some of India's home advantage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:38:01.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
