A creation of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, he was created in response to the Nazi uprising, according to Simon’s daughter, Melissa Groben. “Captain America was created while the Jews were being killed off in Europe, and my father, being Jewish, and Jack, being Jewish, were enraged that America was not over there with our military strength,” Groben told the Hollywood Reporter . “They created Captain America to go after Hitler because our country wouldn’t go after Hitler.”\nChris Evans as Captain America.

(Photo: Facebook/Lan Diep) More Some use Cap as a symbol of resistance against President Trump. Groben doesn’t have a problem with that. “We all find whatever we need in a particular character, whatever that may be,” she explained. “So I can’t say that the way anyone is using the character is wrong. If that’s what they see in the character, then that’s what works for them.”\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe has made Captain America more Libertarian in nature — he’s currently in hiding from governing bodies. Meanwhile, Marvel comics made waves by making Captain America a Hydra agent in recent issues after he was brainwashed by Red Skull. This is to say, even Marvel has multiple interpretations of the character.\nNicolas Cage Showed Up at a Nicolas Cage Movie Marathon and Read a Short Story: \nTell us what you think!
