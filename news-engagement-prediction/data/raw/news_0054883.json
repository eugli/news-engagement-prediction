United over UN \nIn an opinion column, Mr Turnbull reiterated his government's opposition to a UN resolution in December that urged an end to Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. \n\"Many view Israel exclusively through the lens of its conflict with the Palestinians,\" Mr Turnbull wrote in The Australian newspaper. \n\"They demand that the [Australian] government take the side of those in the international community who seek to chastise Israel - and it alone - for the continuing failure of the peace process.\" \nMr Netanyahu thanked Mr Turnbull for being willing to \"puncture UN hypocrisy\", describing Israel and Australia as \"extraordinary friends\". \n\"The UN is capable of many absurdities, and I think it's important that you have straightforward and clear countries like Australia that often bring it back to Earth,\" Mr Netanyahu said in a joint press conference. \nMr Turnbull called Israel a \"truly miraculous nation\", and stressed the countries must co-operate on security. \nHe said Australia had always supported a two-state solution. \n\"It needs to be resolved by direct negotiations between the parties and we certainly encourage that,\" he said. Criticism in Australia \nMore than 60 prominent Australians, including business and religious leaders, academics and entertainers, signed an open letter opposing Mr Netanyahu's visit before his arrival. \n\"Mr Netanyahu's policies consistently aim to provoke, intimidate and oppress the Palestinian population which increase that imbalance, thus taking Israel irretrievably further from peace,\" said the statement , organised by the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network. \nSecurity is expected to be tight for Mr Netanyahu's four-day trip. What is the two-state solution? \nA \"two-state solution\" to the decades-old conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is the declared goal of their leaders and the international community. \nIt is the shorthand for a final settlement that would see the creation of an independent state of Palestine within pre-1967 ceasefire lines in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, living peacefully alongside Israel. \nThe UN, the Arab League, the European Union, Russia, Australia, and, until last week , the US routinely restate their commitment to the concept.
