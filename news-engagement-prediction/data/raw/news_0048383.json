Miss Murtha found her dazed mother at home on Mother’s Day in 2013. Doctors said a swollen artery had burst, and she was later declared brain dead. Pictured, Tish Murtha (right) with daughter Ella as a baby ‘Mum had been taken too soon but she could help others live.’ So her heart, kidney, pancreas, liver, eye tissue and lungs were removed, and Miss Murtha was later told that all the transplants had succeeded. She said: ‘She saved the lives of four women and the eyesight of four men.’ Six months later she heard from Mrs Holmes and Mrs Saunders, and then at Christmas 2015 she received a card from Jane’s daughter Maisie, now nine, saying: ‘Thank you for letting your mum save my mummy’s life. Miss Murtha said: ‘Words can’t describe how overwhelmed I felt.’ The three finally got together last August. Miss Murtha said: ‘We got on brilliantly. It feels like we’ve always known each other.’ Mrs Holmes, of Hornsea, East Yorkshire, was in a wheelchair and struggled to breathe after being diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension. She said: ‘Thanks to Ella and Tish I’m now here to see my children grow up.’ Mrs Saunders, who lives with husband Steve and son Alfie, eight, in Reading, needed a transplant after diabetes caused her kidneys to fail. She said: ‘The transplant saved my life.’ The three friends are now fundraising for Maisie, who has cerebral palsy and needs a £20,000 operation to help her walk.
