ADVERTISEMENT \nTrump had tweeted an earlier post which targeted the New York Times, CNN, NBC “and many more” media — and ended with the exclamation “SICK!” \nBut he swiftly deleted that missive before reposting the definitive version — adding two more “enemies” to his blacklist. \nMany US presidents have criticized the press, but Trump’s language has more closely echoed criticism leveled by authoritarian leaders around the world. \nThe 70-year-old built his campaign on criticizing the press as biased. \nOn Thursday he launched a long diatribe at a grievance-filled news conference, in which he blamed the media for his one-month-old administration’s problems. \nIn four tumultuous weeks, Trump has seen his national security advisor ousted, a cabinet nominee withdraw, a centerpiece immigration policy fail in the courts and a tidal wave of damaging leaks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:22:37.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
