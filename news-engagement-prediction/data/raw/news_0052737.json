The aim, we are informed, is to empower the fisherwomen and raise awareness about the issues faced by the Kolis, in addition to highlighting the community’s role in safeguarding the coast.\n\n\"The women will put up 25 stalls and serve authentic Koli dishes. You’ll find seafood in all forms — fried, curried and dry fish preparations,\" says Smita Concessao, a member of the organising committee.\n\"You can expect a variety of dishes, such as fried pomfret , tisrya (clams) sukka and masala-stuffed crab. You will also get to try Bambooke Bombil, a dish that is peculiar to the community and features fried Bombay Duck that has been half-dried outdoors on bamboo scaffolding,\" she adds.\nThe women manning the stalls will be dressed in traditional attire, and there will also be Koli folk performances for attendees to enjoy.\nConcessao says, \"The ambience, too, is worth mentioning. Everything has been placed in such a way that people can enjoy a beautiful view of the sea. You can pick up your food, sit by the sea and just dig in.\"\n\nON: February 25 and 26, 6 pm to 11.30 pm\nAT: Juhu Tara Koliwada.\nCALL: 9869168938", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:35:41.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
