Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nChelsea's seemingly inevitable march towards to the Premier League title sustained a blow as Antonio Conte's men threw away an early lead to draw against Burnley. \nA win would have sent the Blues 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League table and it looked good for the pacesetters when Pedro netted after just seven minutes. \nBut Burnley struck back half-way through the first half when record signing Robbie Brady scored his first goal for the club with a sublime free-kick. \nThe point sees Sean Dyche's men move up to 12th place, while Chelsea are 10 points clear of second-placed Tottenham. \nBut who impressed in the entertaining 1-1 draw at Turf Moor? John Cross has handed out his player ratings here... Conte's men were held in Lancashire (Photo: Darren Walsh) Burnley \nHeaton 6 - A couple of good saves but to Burnley’s credit he wasn’t besieged. \nLowton 6 - Should have scored to put Burnley ahead but denied by fine save. \nKeane 7 - Looks a class act, very strong and composed. Great in the air. \nMee 6 - Solid enough defensive performance from Burnley’s Steady Eddie. \nWard 7 - Terrific full back performance, committed and really got stuck in. \nBoyd 6 - Another workaholic performance from the Burnley winger. A real menace. \nBarton 7 - Booked. Good midfield performance - tenacious and strong. Life in the old dog yet. \nWestwood 6 - Booked. Worked hard open his full debut, largely played well. Brady opened his Clarets account in style (Photo: Reuters) \nBrady 7 - Fabulous free kick to draw Burnley level. Looks £13m very well spent. \nGray 7 - Conte picked him out pre-match as a big threat - and his pace was a threat. \nBarnes 7 - Has history with Chelsea and was a real handful once again. \nSubstitutes \nArfield, for Brady, 65 mins, 6 \nVokes, for Gray, 82 mins", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T17:46:30.427+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
