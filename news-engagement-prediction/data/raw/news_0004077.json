Subra­maniam said a two-hour delay occurred as the golden chariot was loaded onto a trailer. \n“We needed more time to clamp down the chariot securely so that no untoward incident happens,” he said. “It is now ready for its maiden procession.” \nThe chariot is operated by the state government’s Penang Hindu Endowment Board (PHEB). It is widely expected to “compete” for attention with the Nattukottai Chettiars’ traditional silver Thaipusam chariot that was used for the past 126 years. \nWhile the golden chariot will bear the Vel, the silver one will continue to carry an 1854 consecrated statue of the Hindu god Muruga. \nAnnually, devotees offer the silver chariot trays laden with money, gold jewellery, silk, fruits and flo­wers – collected by the chettiars. \nThis is the first time two Thaipusam chariots will make their processions in Penang. \nPHEB chairman Dr P. Ramasa­­my, who also pulled the chariot, said yesterday’s crowd proved that there was good public support for the golden chariot. \n“It’s a chariot for all and everyone is eager to witness its procession,” Dr Ramasamy, who is also Deputy Chief Minister II, said. \nThe chariot went along Jalan Kebun Bunga, Lorong Air Terjun, Jalan Tunku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Macalister, Jalan Residensi and Jalan Utama before returning to the temple. \nOn Wednesday, it will leave Sri Maha Mariamman Temple in Queen Street at 5am, two hours earlier than the silver chariot, which will depart from the Chettiar-owned Kovil Veedu building in Penang Street at 7am on Feb 8.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:58:54.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
