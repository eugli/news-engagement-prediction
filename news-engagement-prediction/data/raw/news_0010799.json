For a good 20 seconds, Patriots fans booed the man who was single-handedly responsible for Tom Brady 's four-game suspension. No one in this stadium seems to like Roger Goodell. This is how loud the boos were when he started talking. #Patriots #SB51 #SuperBowl pic.twitter.com/YnaY4n3KE0 — John Breech (@johnbreech) February 6, 2017 \nIt was almost if Patriots fans used those 20 seconds to exorcise every Deflategate demon. \nBrady and Bill Belichick were both on the podium while the booing happened, and they seemed to enjoy it.
