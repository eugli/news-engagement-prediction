(ABC News: Jake Evans) \nCarers as far afield as Kangaroo Valley, Braidwood and Cowra have also put their hands up to take injured roos from the Carwoola fires. \nMs Stevens said they had to euthanase many of the kangaroos that had already arrived, but less than 48 hours ago, she received a joey the centre had been able to take into its care. \n\"You think of the trauma he's been through, he's extremely scared,\" she said. \n\"He's not used to being near humans so at the moment he's not sure what's happening in his life â€” as well as the pain he's experiencing with those burns.\" Photo: Ms Stevens said the joey was traumatised after the Carwoola fire. (ABC News: Jake Evans) \nBut even as the injured wildlife from the Carwoola fires begin to come in, Ms Stevens said the centre was preparing for the next challenge. \nJoey season kicks off in May, a time when carers can be taking in as many as seven joeys a day. \n\"I'm already worrying about it, to be honest,\" she said. \"We are pretty stretched at the moment.\" No horses lost thanks to social media buddy system Photo: Misty Stebbing created a horse buddy Facebook group that helped save horses in the Carwoola fire. (ABC News: Jake Evans) \nAlthough countless wildlife were killed, not a single horse was lost in the recent fires, thanks to a buddy system established on social media. \nIt was the first time in NSW that every horse was able to be saved in a fire of this level. \nMisty Stebbing, who created the system, lost her own home and horses in a fire 30 years ago. \nNot wanting anyone to suffer the same fate, she set up the Horse Equine Buddy Register Facebook group for horse owners around the ACT, so that in an emergency they could quickly get the animals out of danger. \nOwners on opposite sides of the ACT \"buddy up\" before a fire and in an emergency can quickly call someone else with a horse float to get their horses out. \n\"It means that they don't have to be concerned about taking them to an evacuation centre. They know they've got a buddy who will help them move their horses,\" Ms Stebbing said. \nOver two days members of the buddy system moved more than 200 horses out of the fire grounds to safety. 'I wanted to hug everybody' \nEven though the group was started less than three months ago it has nearly 700 members, and during the fires more than 80 volunteers leapt into action. \nHorse owner Samantha Cochrane is one of the buddies in the group on Facebook. \nShe said she was napping when the fires broke out and woke to dozens of calls and messages offering help to move her 30 horses out of danger. \n\"I was bombarded with messages of 'do you need help?',\" Ms Cochrane said. \n\"I don't even know how to thank them. I didn't have words, I just felt like hugging everybody.\" \nMs Stebbing said she hoped to establish a charity to replicate the success in Carwoola nationwide, as well as educate others about the preparation needed to get horses ready before a fire happens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:15:36.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
