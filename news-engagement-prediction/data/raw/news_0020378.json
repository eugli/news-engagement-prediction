Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Betsy DeVos and the president who nominated the longtime champion of publicly funded private schools to be secretary of Education can have a muted celebration today after Vice-President Mike Pence broke a Senate tie to confirm her . But the surprisingly difficult struggle over DeVos is not a good sign for the policies with which she has been identified.\nFor one thing, her nomination and her performance in confirmation hearings galvanized public education advocates to an unprecedented degree, and also made her a symbol of the sometimes comical fecklessness of the incoming Trump administration generally. As Alia Wong notes , DeVos was the target of a savagely effective Saturday Night Live skit and has become something of a social-media cartoon villain.\n“All us education nerds were on Twitter saying, ‘Whoa, there was an education secretary being spoofed on SNL !’ That says it all, right?” said Joshua Starr, the CEO of PDK International, a professional educators’ association, and the former superintendent of Montgomery County Schools in Maryland. What matters most about DeVos, though, is the polarizing effect her nomination produced in the Senate. None of the ten Democratic senators from states carried by Trump who are up for reelection in 2018 supported her confirmation, and she lost two Republicans (Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski).\nThat spells trouble for the idea Trump embraced during the presidential campaign: using federal education funds as a carrot and stick to get states to embrace and expand “school choice” options, which in the Trump-DeVos universe means giving parents public money to choose private (including religious) schools as well as independently operated public charter schools. Enacting that proposal would involve an amendment to the Every Student Succeeds Act (the successor to No Child Left Behind) that would normally require 60 Senate votes, including eight Democrats. It’s hard to see where those votes would come from.\nIt is possible a radical education proposal like this could be nestled into one of the two budget reconciliation bills Congress is expected to consider this year, assuming Republicans can get their act together on various related political and policy decisions. But the first of those bills is supposed to repeal Obamacare, and the second is reserved for tax cuts, and after the furor over DeVos it is doubtful the administration or its congressional allies will want to risk either of those mega-priorities by engaging the political buzzsaw that endangered the DeVos nomination.\nTags: betsy devos vouchers susan collins lisa murkowski donald trump every student succeeds More Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Trump Administration Gives Final Approval to Dakota Access Pipeline Two New England Patriots Say They’ll Skip White House Visit Trump’s Homeland Security Head Takes Blame for Travel Ban Rollout Most Viewed Stories Somebody Found Sean Spicer’s Venmo and Now People Are Asking Him for Money A Brief History of ‘Cash Me Outside, Howbow Dah?’ Trump Just Declared the ‘Court System’ a Threat to National Security Trump Reportedly Upset That Sean Spicer Was Portrayed by a Woman on SNL Obamacare Repeal Is Failing Because It Was Based on a Lie Trump Reportedly Upset That Sean Spicer Was Portrayed by a Woman on SNL Only Richard Branson Could Help Obama Cram 8 Years of Relaxation Into One Vacation Trump Reportedly Upset That Sean Spicer Was Portrayed by a Woman on SNL Eight Legendary Women, All of Whom Are Jessica Lange The Bachelor Recap: Nick in Retrograde Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer The Second Avenue Subway Is New York’s Newest World-Class Museum Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 25 mins ago Trump Administration Gives Final Approval to Dakota Access Pipeline The Army Corps of Engineers has decided to scrap that environmental-impact assessment it promised and just approve the previously proposed route.\n5:49 p.m. Two New England Patriots Say They’ll Skip White House Visit Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty are protesting Trump.\n5:23 p.m. Trump’s Homeland Security Head Takes Blame for Travel Ban Rollout Even though multiple reports say he was barely consulted on the executive order.\n3:14 p.m. Betsy DeVos May Be Hurting Her Cause of School Privatization Trump’s secretary of Education has become a rallying point for public-school defenders.\n2:53 p.m. Trump Is Right: No One Ever Talks About the Obama-Khamenei Bromance The liberal media criticizes Trump for being friendly with Putin, but never says anything about Obama’s bromance with the grand ayatollah of Iran.\n1:24 p.m. WATCH: Betsy DeVos Was Just Confirmed in an Unprecedented Tiebreaker Vote Vice-President Mike Pence delivered the first tie-breaking vote for a cabinet appointee in history.\n12:23 p.m. Trump’s Labor Secretary Nominee Says He Hired Undocumented Housekeeper Andy Puzder’s confirmation hearings have been postponed indefinitely.\n11:30 a.m. Red-State Democrats Not Rushing to Help Republicans Just Yet The GOP assumed that Dems from pro-Trump states might be of help in the Senate.
