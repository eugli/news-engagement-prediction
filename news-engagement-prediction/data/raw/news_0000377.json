Two out of the party’s nine MPs abstained, while the rest voted against the bill . \nHe was speaking as May prepared to publish a white paper later on Thursday morning, which will set out in more detail the government’s plan for Brexit. \nNo 10 will be hoping the document satisfies would-be Conservative rebels who could threaten to back opposition amendments if they feel there is not enough parliamentary scrutiny of the process. \nThe legislation is still highly likely to pass through parliament and make it into law, allowing May to meet her self-imposed deadline of triggering article 50 before the end of March.
