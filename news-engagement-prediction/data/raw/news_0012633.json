The president does have the authority to ban the entry of foreigners, as long as he has what is called a “rational basis” to believe they pose a threat to the nation’s security. He does, and his order is designed to accomplish precisely that. \nThe seven nations targeted by Trump in his immigration ban were originally identified in an anti-terrorism law signed by President Obama.
