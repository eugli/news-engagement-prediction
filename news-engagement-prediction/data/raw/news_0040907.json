'I believe that is the ambition of many peers of different parties and of no parties. That is the opportunity, that is the ambition of many people in the weeks ahead.' Labour has vowed not to provoke any long delays to the legislation but has tabled eight amendments of its own for the committee stage of the Bill. Lady Chakrabarti was appearing on the latest edition of the flagship BBC show last night, which was filmed in Glasgow The Prime Minister has vowed to invoke Article 50 before the end of March but delays to the legislation look likely to stop her doing so at the EU summit on March 9 Ministers would be confident of overturning any defeats in what is known as Parliamentary 'ping pong' - triggered when the Commons and Lords disagree on amendments to legislation.
