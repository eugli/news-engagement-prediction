(Picture: Marjorie Cabatingan Aboy) (Picture: Marjorie Cabatingan Aboy) \nThe earthquake struck on Sunday and since then many carcasses have been washed up. \nSome believe that it may be a whale, others have suggested a polar bear. Or a whale/polar bear hybrid. Or a big Shih tzu. Witches are putting a spell on Donald Trump at midnight \nWe think it looks a bit like an English sheepdog. \nWhen a mass of organic matter washes up on the shore like this it is referred to as a ‘globster’. \nBy the way, the mystery has actually been solved. It’s the body of a whale and it’s in advanced decomposition. It’s believed to have died two weeks ago after being hit by a ship.
