Thanks to the rise of superhero films and CG animation, bringing the world of Atlantis to life is doable, and no one is more excited to visit the world than Jason Momoa . The actor made headlines when Warner Bros. confirmed he’d been cast to play Arthur Curry on the big screen. And, in a recent interview, the leading man said the film will be unlike any seen before. \nSpeaking with Digital Trends , the actor spoke about Aquaman which is currently in pre-production abroad. When asked about the film, Momoa was quick to gush about its script and adventurous tone. \n“I read the ( Aquaman ) script and let me just put it this way, I’ve never seen a movie that’s anything like this. It’s going to be a world that you’ve never seen before, which is really cool,” Momoa said. \nHe continued, saying, “We went to space, we traveled all over different worlds, but we never went underwater. So it’s just a really cool spin on what’s below and it uses a lot of great movies that I already love — whether that be Raiders of the Lost Ark to Star Wars to Lord of the Rings to Romancing the Stone . It has a lot of really cool adventure, it’s funny and heroic, and there’s a lot of different characters and a lot of different worlds that we get to go to” \n“So I’ve never really seen anything like it. I think it would be an absolutely amazing game and that would be the greatest character in the world.” \nLet us know how pumped you are about Justice League and Aquaman's debut below with our anticipation rankings! \nIn Justice League, fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman’s selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes—Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash—it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions. \nJustice League is directed by Zack Snyder, from a screenplay by Chris Terrio, and features an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Ciarán Hinds, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, Jeremy Irons and Jesse Eisenberg.
