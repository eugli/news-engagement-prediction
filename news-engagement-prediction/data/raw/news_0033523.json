(Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPolice in San Francisco have an open investigation into a domestic violence incident regarding pass rusher Aldon Smith. \nAn incident report was filed on Saturday, and both Smith and the woman who filed the complaint are cooperating with the investigation, San Francisco Police Department spokeswoman Giselle Talkoff told USA TODAY Sports. \nNo arrests have been made or charges filed. \nTMZ first reported the investigation on Monday. \nSmith remains suspended by the NFL for repeated violations of the substance abuse policy following multiple incidents involving alcohol, including two DUIs, while he was with the San Francisco 49ers. He played in 2015 with the Oakland Raiders before he was banned. \nHe has applied for reinstatement, but in December, the NFL deferred ruling Smithâ€™s case until March. The league declined comment on Monday. \nRaiders owner Mark Davis said in 2015 that the team had a \"zero-tolerance\" policy regarding domestic violence. \n\"It's just something we can't tolerate,\" Davis said, according to the San Francisco Chronicle . \"I don't know how to fix it in society but I know we can't have it on our team.\" \nFollow Lindsay H.
