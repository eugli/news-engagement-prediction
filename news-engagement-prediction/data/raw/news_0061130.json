Agreed that menstruation or periods, as we usually call it can be annoying and quite painful. Over the years, there have been many products that have often vouched to make menstruating days comfortable for women — from effective pads to tampons, but never have women been offered a glue. Yes, a glue that would seal a lady’s vagina!\nA US chiropractor, Dr Dan Dopps, has come up with what’s being labelled as the most bizarre ‘menstrual product’ — a ‘Feminine Lip-Stick’ literally to ‘stick’ labia together. The product called the Mensez is “a proprietary combination of amino acids and natural oils in a lipstick applicator.”Describing the use, the website reads, “When applied to the labia minora, it creates a temporary seal to retain menstrual fluids inside until urination.” Seriously, keeping menstrual fluids inside — isn’t that quite unnatural if not unhygienic!\nDr Dopps’ note on LinkedIn . The makers have campaigned it as a “carefree security” option but women across the globe are furious with this “disgusting” option. Most people are saying that the person has “zero knowledge” about female genitalia while there are others who are blatantly asking if he even knows the difference between urethra and vagina.\nHere’s how the website elaborated the purpose of the lipstick. The patent for Mensez was granted on January 10, this year, however, the product is yet to hit the stands. Whether the product is safe or not is a different question, but Twitterati feels, it’s certainly misogynistic.\nI’m not worried about bacteria with this, no different than a cup or tampon. Am worried about labial damage! http://t.co/CW2SsdNfVs\n— Jennifer Gunter (@DrJenGunter) February 22, 2017\nThis is a serious product. WT ACTUAL F.

Just…NO… As a guy, I’m mortified at the lack of basic anatomy on display.
