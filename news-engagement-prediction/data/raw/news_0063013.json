He vowed that the president’s feud with the press will not improve. \n“It’s not only not going to get better,” Bannon said. “It’s going to get worse every day. … They’re corporatist, globalist media that are adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like Trump has.” \n“Here’s why it’s going to get worse,” Bannon added. “Because he’s going to continue to press his agenda. And as economic conditions get better, as more jobs get better, they’re going to continue to fight. If you think they’re going to give you your country back without a fight, you are sadly mistaken. Every day, it is going to be a fight.” Steve Bannon on Trump's differences with the media: \"It's not going to get better. It's going to get worse.\" https://t.co/T8qS49DGwx \n— CNN (@CNN) February 23, 2017 \nBannon said that very agenda appealed to CPAC attendees the first time Trump spoke at the conference, noting that the president is scheduled to address the conference Friday. \nAmerican Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp asked the pair if the “Trump movement” can coincide with conservatism, given the “diversity” in thought between the two ideologies. \n“It has to,” Priebus replied. He added that “we have to stick together as a team” to use Trump’s victory as an “opportunity” and to keep the president in office for eight years. \nSchlapp also asked what they liked best about each other. Priebus praised Bannon for his “dogged” dedication to Trump’s vision and for his “loyalty” to the president. Bannon lauded Priebus as a “steady” hand in the White House and “unwavering” in implementing Trump’s agenda.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:30:52.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
