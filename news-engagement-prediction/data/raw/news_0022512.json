She also pleaded guilty to a larceny charge for collecting about $1,400 in welfare benefits after her daughter’s death in May 2015.\nBella Bond’s remains were found in a plastic bag on Deer Island.\nA composite image of the chubby-cheeked, wide-eyed girl was shared by millions on social media when authorities were trying to identify her. Three months later, Rachelle Bond told a friend of her boyfriend, Michael McCarthy, that McCarthy had killed her daughter.\nAs part of her plea agreement with prosecutors, Bond has agreed to testify against McCarthy at his trial, scheduled to begin in April. Bond and McCarthy have been in jail since September 2015.\nIn court Friday, Bond’s lawyer, Janice Bassil, said Bond’s daughter “was everything to her.” She said Bond is eager to testify against McCarthy.\n“I do see her as a victim in this case,” Bassil said of Rachelle Bond.\nProsecutors have said Bella’s short life was marked by neglect and abuse. A man who briefly lived with the couple told investigators that he twice saw Bond and McCarthy lock her in a closet for 30 minutes to an hour while she screamed to be let out.\nProsecutors said Bond told the man that McCarthy — angry that Bella didn’t want to go to sleep one night — punched her daughter in the abdomen over and over again until she died.\nBond told police that when she saw her daughter’s body, McCarthy said: “She was a demon anyway. It was her time to die.”\nMcCarthy has denied killing the girl. His lawyer has said Bond told McCarthy that Bella had been taken away by the state Department of Children and Families.\nAssistant District Attorney David Deakin said prosecutors will recommend a sentence of time-served after Bond testifies against McCarthy. That would result in Bond serving under two years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:07:06.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
