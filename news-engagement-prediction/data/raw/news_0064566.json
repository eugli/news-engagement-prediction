There's an initiative throughout Japan called Premium Friday, which encourages firms to let staff out of the office around 3 p.m. on the last Friday of each month. \nOver in the US, Amazon last year tested a 30-hour work week after a New York Times report that depicted it as a \"challenging, even merciless place to work.\" Share your voice", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:34:11.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
