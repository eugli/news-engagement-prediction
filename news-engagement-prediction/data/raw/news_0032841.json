Spicey is really blowing away the White House press corps. #SNL pic.twitter.com/HSbKAX07zz — Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) February 12, 2017 \nSpicy also explains “extreme vetting” with the use of “dollies,” while also touching on a list of “terrorist incidents” that the media “never even write about,” including “the Bowling Green Massacre, the horror in Six Flags, the slaughter at Fraggle Rock, and the Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.” Couldn't make this any more clear. #SNL pic.twitter.com/7i1rHvsi7V — Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) February 12, 2017 \nReferring to Nordstrom’s ditching of Ivanka Trump’s clothing brand as “light terrorism,” Spicer turns the briefing into a shopping channel selling one of Ivanka’s bracelets, which Spicer is wearing. Don't even get Spicey started on Nordstrom pulling Ivanka Trump's clothing line. #SNL pic.twitter.com/pmf08pQNUq — Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) February 12, 2017 \n“These babies are a real head turner,” Spicer adds, while lifting her leg into the air to show off one of her leopard print shoes. \nTrump was reportedly “rattled” by Spicer being played by woman, with SNL turning the screw even further this week by having Kate McKinnon play the part of Trump’s new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who tells the press that “there are two kinds of crime, regular and black,” before Spicer pushes him off the podium. \nMcCarthy played Spicer for the first time on Saturday February 4, after which Spicer himself told Extra that, while the skit was “funny,” he thought the actor “needs to slow down on the gum chewing; way too many pieces in there,” adding that she “could dial back” a bit. The people playing the characters on SNL are now probably more qualified to do the job then the ppl they portray #SNLSpicer #SNL pic.twitter.com/i4WOcjE5aC — Nasty Woman (@NastyWoman20) February 12, 2017 I don't mind at all that SNL makes fun of Trump Administration. What's disturbing is the liberals who get their news watching it. #SNLSpicer — Erika~Build Our Wall (@ms_erika74) February 12, 2017 The only thing funnier than #SNL is watching whiny Trump voters bitch and moan about being ridiculed. #SNLSpicer — Kiffin Eckert (@k_r_eckert) February 12, 2017 So far Donald Trump has made only one thing great again: Saturday Night Live! 👌😄 #SNLSpicer — Hafiz Shariff (@HafizDoc) February 12, 2017 \nTrump has lashed out at SNL on a number of occasions for its satirization of him and his administration, branding the show “unwatchable” and “not funny” in a December tweet. \nHe has yet to publicly comment on the comedy show’s latest sketches.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T16:47:18.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
