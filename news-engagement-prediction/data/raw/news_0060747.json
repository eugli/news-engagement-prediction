It causes swollen and tender glands.\nThe players who are showing symptoms are being sidelined by the outbreak: They are being tested and quarantined in isolation for a five-day period, or until tests results prove negative, according to the team.\nVancouver Coastal Health authorities have been sent to Rogers Arena to screen the players and staff and provide immunizations for those who require it.\nAll dressing room areas are being disinfected, a recommendation from health authorities.\nThe team is working with the Vancouver Health Authority, NHL, NHLPA and BC Centre for Disease Control to \"minimize transmission of the illness.\"\nThe Canucks are set to play the San Jose Sharks Saturday night at Rogers Arena. The team has not said if the upcoming game, or any other games in the calendar, will be cancelled or altered because of the illness.\nRelated Stories Public urged to update vaccines after mumps, measles cases reported Mumps cases linked to bars in Toronto rises to 17 Mumps outbreak in Toronto appears linked to downtown bars: health officials Photos Vancouver Canucks' Troy Stecher swats the puck out of the air with his hand during the third period of an NHL hockey game against the Colorado Avalanche in Vancouver, B.C., on Monday, Jan. 2, 2017.
