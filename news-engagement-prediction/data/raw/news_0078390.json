After the passing of my wife three years ago, JJ then became the pillar of the family.\" \n\"Losing and mourning a child is an entirely different feeling than losing a spouse,” said Volmink. \nVolmink was on his way to Joburg to identify the body. \n“I am fearful of what I will see. I am currently dealing with the logistics and that is delaying the process of my mourning.” \nIn 2008, along with Isaac Mogajane, JJ set out to pursue his lifelong passion for film-making and launched a direct-to-customer distribution company aimed at servicing the rapidly growing market for local films. \nIn 2009, the pair met their third partner, Kagiso Lediga, and founded Diprente Films. \nSince then, JJ produced some of South Africa’s most iconic TV shows and films, including the International Emmy-nominated news satire Late Nite News with Loyiso Gola, Blitz Patrollie, The Bantu Hour featuring jazz legend Hugh Masekela, as well as the upcoming feature film Catching Feelings, starring Kagiso Lediga, Pearl Thusi, Akin Omotoso and Andrew Buckland. \nJJ was also involved in the development and early production of a number of large-scale international productions across multiple media, including film, television and animation. \nDespite his early and unexpected passing, his legacy will live on through his projects and through the work that Diprente Films and everyone he has inspired will continue to create in the years to come. \nHe leaves his wife Kristie and their daughter Hannah. \nCape Argus ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T10:05:40.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
