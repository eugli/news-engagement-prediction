I understand things. I comprehend very well. OK? Better than, I think, almost anybody.\" \nDuring his remarks, the president also said a Boston federal judge who had ruled in favour of his policy was a \"highly respected\" and \"perfect\" jurist. \nMr Trump also referred to his immigration ban as a \"weapon\". \n\"We have to give you the weapons that you need,\" he told police chiefs, \"and this is a weapon that you need and they're trying to take it away from you, maybe because of politics or maybe because of political views.\" Media caption Lancaster, Pennsylvania: America's refugee capital \nAlso on Wednesday morning, Mr Trump criticised retailer Nordstrom after it decided not to stock her new clothing line. \n\"My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person - always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!\" Mr Trump tweeted. \nShares of the retailer fell 0.7%, before rallying slightly. \nIn Tuesday's hearing, the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals posed tough questions at those challenging and defending Mr Trump's travel ban. \nThe court is expected to issue a ruling as early as Wednesday.
