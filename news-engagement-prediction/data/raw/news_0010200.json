The Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) also came into force this year, with calls for greater efforts towards their implementation.\nAlso this year, which marks his last at the helm Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon apologized to the people of Haiti for the world body’s role in failing to properly address the cholera epidemic that has claimed the lives of at least 9,000 Haitians since 2010.
