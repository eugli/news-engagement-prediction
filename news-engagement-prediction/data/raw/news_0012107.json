Then I have a creative task for you. Tell me, is this poem from the Bush era, still relevant today? 'When the president talks to god Does he ever think that maybe he's not? That that voice is just inside his head When he kneels next to the presidential bed Does he ever smell his own bulls**t When the president talks to god. I doubt it. I doubt it.' This, ladies and gentlemen, is what is being taught in British schools. Teachers asking children to think about Trump and his bulls**t. And whether he smells it. Do they smell their own I wonder? I doubt it, I doubt it. Thirteen-year-old children were given this poem in a 'creative writing task', and were asked to imagine 'how Trump would react' Another teacher made protest banners with her class of twelve-year-olds (I repeat: twelve-year-olds) whom she took along to the protest against Trump outside Westminster. She even had a pathetic picture taken to commemorate the occasion. Tell me: would you be happy if this was the teacher of your twelve-year-old? Even as my suspicions have been growing about the indoctrination of our young children by so-called liberals, so has the number of stories arriving in my inbox. Worried parents whose little kids come home repeating opinions they have been taught in school, rather than lessons, wondering how they should talk to the school about it without getting their kids into trouble. Children being taught that Trump is a bad man and a racist. That Brexit is wrong. That the correct answer is Clinton. A young man aged 17 from Hertfordshire was ostracised from his politics class for daring to admit he supported Trump. He was told by the teacher to have 'less strong views' and was isolated by his class. Eventually he dropped the subject completely because no one would sit with him or talk to him. A child isolated for his opinion and hounded for his views. Another worried mother, Rachel from Solihull recounts that her eight-year-old came home from primary school and asked her why she liked Trump when he is a racist and hates women. This teacher made protest banners with her class of twelve-year-olds whom she took along to the protest against Trump outside Westminster The protesting teacher then had a pathetic picture taken to commemorate the occasion The child had been shown the news, told by his teacher that Trump hates women, Muslims and Mexicans and is a Bad Man. Elsewhere, a headmaster of a secondary school in Chester gave a lecture featuring his own brand of politics, alarming the kids about the state of the world. He said he hoped to see his pupils again next week 'if Trump has not pressed the nuclear button by then', and sent them home with a newsletter reinforcing his point. And then this from a mum in Bournemouth 'My seven-year-old daughter came home from school saying she had been learning Donald Trump's job is to take care of all the people but he doesn't because he is a nasty evil man. 'I asked her why, and she said ... in school they had been shown a newspaper of a little girl holding up a sign saying 'not my President' because Trump had held a book and sworn to take care of all people but he lied. 'Because American people don't have newspapers, they cannot see what a horrible man he really is and what he is really like. And a lady wanted to be president and she actually got more votes than him. But they still let him win. And that's not fair.' This poster was pinned to a classroom wall by a teacher Other parents also told of assemblies for twelve-year-olds in Swindon in which Donald Trump's ban on refugees entering the country had been compared to the Holocaust. Small children in Chelmsford were taught in morning assembly on June 24 following the vote for Leave that 'your parents will be very sad tonight. They might even be crying. Because people who do not want us to be friends with Europe voted the wrong way'. Clearly, children need to be aware of the news and current affairs. I buy my own children a children's newspaper so they can form their own views.
