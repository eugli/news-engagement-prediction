One reason was publicity and, accordingly, its PR campaign, orchestrated by 20th Century Fox was hailed with Maxwell Weinberg Publicist Showmanship Motion Picture Award, recognizing it as the year's best in the film arena at the International Cinematographer's Guild's 54th annual Publicists Awards luncheon. NBC's This Is Us won the equivalent TV honor. \nBut the biggest story at the Beverly Hilton gathering was the rare public appearance of BWR Public Relations co-founder Nanci Ryder , who is battling ALS, to accept the guild's President's Award from her former client Renee Zellweger . Following a tearful tribute from Zellweger, as well as a montage of Ryder's work in showbiz and on behalf of ALS, Zellweger read a bittersweet acceptance speech from Ryder, who has lost the ability to speak and walk since her diagnosis in 2014. As relayed by Zellweger, Ryder joked that she wanted the award to be renamed for her, since \"it doesn't feel like a great time to be getting an award called the President's Award\"— after which she was wheeled on to the stage to a prolonged standing ovation. \nRyder also was hailed as the ultimate example of a publicist and \"an inspiration\" by fellow honoree Jeffrey Katzenberg , who was on hand to collect — from his Almost Famous and Kung Fu Panda 3 collaborator Kate Hudson — the guild's Lifetime Achievement Award. On a lighter note, Katzenberg, the former CEO of DreamWorks Animation, showed a slideshow of many of the great Cannes PR stunts on behalf of his films — and he then brought the house down with a video of him promoting 1994's The Lion King , at the urging of a publicist, by playing with a menacing lion on a Las Vegas stage. \nRyan Murphy accepted the guild's Television Showman Award from his muse Sarah Paulson — who said Murphy was \"single-handedly responsible for making my dreams come true\" and \"saved my life\"— whereupon Murphy said that the showmanship he's proudest of lately is pursuing gender and sexuality equality at his production company. \nIn the luncheon's final award, Fences best actor Oscar nominee Denzel Washington collected the Motion Picture Showman Award. \nIn the competitive categories, Rosalind Jarrett Sepulveda , who joined the guild in 1980 and has represented the SAG Awards since their inception, was named the winner of the Les Mason Award, the highest honor for a publicist, which she collected from SAG-AFTRA chief Gabrielle Carteris . \nBrent Simon won the International Media Award. Andrew Schwartz won the Excellence in Unit Still Photography for Motion Pictures Award. John Johnson won the Excellence in Unit Still Photography for Television Award. And Grae Drake of Rotten Tomatoes won the Press Award — something a past recipient, Anthony Breznican, likened to a cop receiving an award from the mafia.
