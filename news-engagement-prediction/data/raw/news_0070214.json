(Courtesy Larry Dolezal) The 39-year-old also lost her job as an adjunct instructor at Eastern Washington university because of the ordeal, and she hasn’t been able to get work since.\nThe former professor and columnist told the Guardian she’s applied for more than 100 jobs, but not a single place will hire her. The only offers that have come her way have been for reality television and porn.\nDolezal now relies on food stamps to feed her family and has been receiving help from a friend to cover her — next month she expects to be homeless, the Guardian reported.\nShe added her memoir titled “In Full Color,” due out in March, was turned down by 30 publishing houses before anyone would be willing to print it.\n“Right now the only place I feel understood and completely accepted is with my kids and my sister,” she told the news outlet. “The narrative was that I’d offended both communities in an unforgivable way, so anybody who gave me a dime would be contributing to wrong and oppression and bad things. To a liar and fraud and a con.”\n12 photos view gallery Rachel Dolezal through the years Dolezal said she wrote her book not only to tell her side of the story, “but to also open up this dialogue about race and identity, and to just encourage people to be exactly who they are.”\nWhen questioned about her race, Dolezal would just tell people that she was mixed, but she doesn’t feel as though she was lying.\n“The times I tried to explain more, I wasn’t understood more. Nobody wanted to hear, ‘I’m pan-African, pro-black, bisexual, an artist, mother and educator,’” she told the Guardian. “People would just be like, ‘Huh? What? What are you talking about?’\n“So I felt like by not talking about my biological ancestry, I gave people the opportunity to relate to me as an individual, not part of a group.”\nShe also noted that she’d never consider going back to being white.\n“No. This is still home to me,” Dolezal said. “I didn’t feel like I’m ever going to be hurt so much that I somehow leave who I am, because I’m me. It really is who I am. It’s not a choice.”\nSend a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T19:57:07.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
