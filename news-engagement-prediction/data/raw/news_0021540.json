SCOTT HAMMOND/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe Taylor Pass Rd memorial site after it was vandalised. \nShe erected a cross at the site which became a makeshift shrine for the popular teen, with a greenstone necklace and Holden Matchbox cars left in tribute. \nREAD MORE: \nBut for two years Trower paid her respects at a damaged site after vandals targeted the tribute by sawing the cross in half and taking the mementos in late 2014. SCOTT HAMMOND/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe top of Regan Paul's memorial cross was snapped off in 2014. \nTrower, who lives in Westport, had purchased wood and was ready to finally repair the site until she visited late last month. \n\"I went to where my son was killed to find that somebody had put a brand new cross up,\" she said. \nA 2-foot tall timber cross, painted white with smoothed corners, was a surprise that brought Trower to tears. \nTrower believed her sister and brother-in-law had repaired the memorial, while they thought it had been her. Ad Feedback \n\"It's really, really weird. I had recently said to my husband that I must get it done, I had the timber sitting here,\" she said. \n\"I kind of couldn't believe that someone would do that. It always will be an emotional place for me.\" \nAfter asking family and friends, Trower said she still did not know who was behind the good deed and was determined to find out. \n\"I want to find out who they are because I would love to thank them,\" she said. \n\"It has to be a caring person. Whether it is somebody who knows him or not I don't know, but either way it has impacted me.\" \nTrower had mobility problems and required a wheelchair to move large distances. \nShe had wanted to fix the cross after it was damaged but it was not an easy task for her. \n\"You hear about bad things all the time, but this repairs my faith in people,\" she said. \nAbout 500 people attended Regan's funeral when he died 17 years ago. \nThe mystery person made the memorial something family and friends could be proud of, Trower said. \nIf you have any information on who replaced the memorial cross, contact jeffrey.kitt@fairfaxmedia.co.nz. - The Marlborough Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:52:02.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
