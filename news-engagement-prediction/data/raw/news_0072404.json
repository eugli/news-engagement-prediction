NASA has found what pretty much appears to be a backup solar system a mere 40 light-years away. And not a moment too soon. SEE ALSO: NASA may put astronauts on the first flight of its new mega-rocket \nScientists discovered seven Earth-sized exoplanets circling a dwarf star, TRAPPIST-1, and everyone on Earth is ready to sign up for a one-way ticket to the new system. (Using current technology, it would be nearly impossible for humans to get to the planetary system, however. #Thanks2017.)\nView photos \nImage: NASA/JPL-CALTECH\nEveryone also immediately made the scientific achievement about the 45th president. With seven new worlds suddenly available, the possibilities seemed endless. Earthlings could send Trump to the new system. He could mess up these exoplanets before destroying Earth. Or we could all flee to these new worlds and leave Trump behind.\nTwitter was filling up with Trump and TRAPPIST-1 jokes as soon as NASA made the announcement.\nTrump just announced that we're building a giant space barrier around the Earth, and we're going to get planet Trappist-e to pay for it\nâ€” Jason Mayland (@JaymayAllDay) February 22, 2017 \nTrump administration announces plan to build wall around #TRAPPIST -1 system.\nâ€” Mike Spry (@mdspry) February 22, 2017 \nIn breaking news.
