But three billion years ago, a continent covered the ocean where the East African island now lies, according to a new study. Researchers have discovered evidence for this continent hiding underneath through crystals carried in volcanic lava. Scroll down for video The researchers discovered zirconian crystals near the Mauritian volcano (pictured), which they believe are betwen 2.5 and 3 billion years old The ancient continent of Mauritia once sat between Madagascar and India. It is thought Mauritia separated from the rest of the continent around 60 million years ago THE LOST CONTINENT OF MAURITIA The continental crust beneath Mauritius would have been part of the continent 'Mauritia'. The continent would have been a dangerous place, covered in volcanoes and exposed to regular earthquakes. 'Mauritia acted as a buffer zone between the western Indian subcontinent and eastern Madagascar, and was fragmented by numerous tectonic and volcanic events that occurred in that region since the early Cretaceous,' the authors said. It is thought Mauritia separated from the rest of the continent around 60 million years ago. Professor Lewis Ashwal and colleagues from Wits University, in Johannesburg, found pieces of zirconian crystals, between 2.5 billion and three billion years old on Mauritius. The crystals were brought to the surface by a volcano, carried by its lava. The researchers dated the crystals using an imaging technique called mass spectrometry. They found evidence for a continental crust beneath Mauritius, which would have been part of the continent 'Mauritia' and formed part of the ancient nucleus of Madagascar and India. 'Our results demonstrate the existence of ancient continental crust beneath Mauritius, Professor Ashwal wrote in the study published in Nature Communications . 'Mauritius and other Mauritian continental fragments are dominantly underlain by Archaean continental crust, and that these originally formed part of the ancient nucleus of Madagascar and India.'
