This was framed as a “state’s rights” thing, because that allows Trump, Betsy DeVos, Jeff Sessions and every other monster who signed off on this to feel like they’re not personally promoting discrimination, they’re just changing the rules to make it easier for other people to be discriminatory. Anyway, a significant outcry against this policy erupted almost instantaneously, with many people noting that this will simply marginalize transgender kids even more than society does. \nOne of this decision’s vocal opponents is comedian Rhea Butcher, who has shared a bunch of posts on Twitter about her own experiences with bathrooms and other people’s narrow understanding of what “gender” means. You can read her whole string of tweets below. I’ve spent my entire life terrified of public bathrooms 1/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 I’ve had people threaten me, harrass me, etc in the women’s public restroom 2/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 My parents were always divorced. My dad never took me to the bathroom, I had to go alone. Most visits, I held it 3/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 I was scared as a kid to go to the bathroom alone, mostly because of kidnapping scares (I watched too much tv without supervision) 4/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 When I was 5 I went camping w/ my dad and went to a public bathroom alone, while he waited in his truck 5/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 I had a chin length bob hair cut and a too big Batman shirt and some “surf” shorts my mom made for me. Slip on fake Vans 6/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 I went into the restroom and as I entered, a furious voice bellowed, “WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?!” 7/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 I was terrified. I didn’t know what to do. I can’t remember if I said “I’m a girl” or if I stayed silent. I can’t even remember if I left 8/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 I don’t know if I told my dad. I told him a bout instances later on in my life and his response was always “well, what’d you expect?” 9/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 In addition to being the first time I was harassed and assaulted for being in a pub restroom, this incident sticks with me 10/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 It hurt me and changed me so deeply, it engrained in me a fear of adults that I still have to this day 11/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 And this person who assaulted me for being what they thought was the wrong gender in the women’s bathroom? This person was a man. 12/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 This man was cleaning the women’s bathroom and told me I was wrong. Incorrect. I shouldn’t be there, I shouldn’t be me. He was “Right.” 13/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 The bathroom fight is about so much more than peeing. It’s about the right to exist. To be. /14 — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 Public bathrooms are a concentrated version of gender conformity. Not only are literally forced through a “woman” door or “man” door 15/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 We then have to fit through an even narrower understanding of what SOMEONE else thinks is visually appropriate for that gender 16/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 I am serving jury duty right now. Moments ago, I had to reassure a confused woman that she was, indeed, in the women’s restroom 18/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 This happens everyday to trans, nonbinary, genderqueer folks. We have to hide or edit or confront. Eyes everywhere. Every. Single. Day. 19/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 And this law is about KIDS. Children. Little tiny people. Forced to enter a space that scares them. Told by adults they are wrong. 20/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 My mom was always supportive. This was 1987, she did her best. Told me to ask where the women’s restroom was instead of just restroom 21/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 She told me I was perfect and I could do and be whatever I wanted. 22/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 She's a seamstress and made me dresses. She never once made me feel bad for not wanting her dresses, for actively despising them 23/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 My mom works at a convenience pharmacy in Akron, Ohio. She wears a safety pin to work every day. 24/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 In conclusion: we need your help. Kids need your help. See them, love them. It's more than just needing to pee. It's about being. 25/ — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 And if you need someone to talk to, @Translifeline and @TrevorProject are there for you. — Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 \nSubmit your Great Job, Internet tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T10:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:32:14.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
