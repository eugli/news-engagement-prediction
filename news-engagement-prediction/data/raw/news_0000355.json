ROSS GIBLIN/FAIRFAX NZ \nPaula Lester-Garcia, owner of the Clockwork Steampunk Emporium in Wellington's Old Bank Arcade, was thrilled to sell a hat to Guns N' Roses star. \n\"He just looked like any other guy, but then I got talking to them,\" Lester-Garcia said. \nREAD MORE \n\"The first thing I asked, which is what I always ask any customer, is how do you know about Steampunk? And they explained that they were from Seattle and it's quite popular there.\" HANNAH MCKEE/FAIRFAX NZ \nMcKagan purchased a black bowler hat by Petone-based company Hills Hats, retailing at $165. \nIt wasn't long before McKagan was browsing the Victorian-influenced science fiction fashion store. \n\"He was just looking around and his wife said 'you should really get a hat!', and he said 'I'm not so sure if I suit hats'. \n\"The first thing he tried on was this white helmet, and I said what about a top hat? He said, 'No, no I can't have top hat, one of the other members of the band is really well known for his top hat'.\" HANNAH MCKEE/FAIRFAX NZ \nMcKagan also tried on this exact helmet, still sitting in the shop, before settling on the bowler. \nMcKagan went for a black bowler hat by the Petone-based company Hills Hats, which retails at NZ$165. Ad Feedback \n\"We have a luxury version and I thought afterwards I should have sold them the luxury version, they could afford it!\" Lester-Garcia laughed. \nIt's not the first famous face to step into her store, with a member of AC/DC coming in last year to purchase a ray gun. \nLester-Garcia hopes the couple may have told the other band members about their shopping experience. \n\"I was telling the wife to try on a corset but she said she wasn't feeling very good and might come back today. \n\"I gave her a brochure and said she should tell Slash because I'm sure he'd like a hat. If he came in today, that would be pretty cool.\" \nHills Hats owner Simon Smuts-Kennedy said knowing a Guns N' Roses member had purchased one of their hats was a great compliment. \n\"I've listened to them for a long time, they were definitely in vogue in my teens,\" he said, \"It's marvellous.\" \nHe listed famous faces such as Orlando Bloom, Miranda Kerr, and the members of Fat Freddy's Drop as also being on their customer list. \nGuns N' Roses perform at Wellington's Westpac Stadium on February 2, and Auckland's Western Springs on February 4. \nHave you spotted any members of Guns N' Roses around Wellington?
