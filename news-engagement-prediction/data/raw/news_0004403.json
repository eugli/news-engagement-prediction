He bragged to an FBI source in 2010 about how he’d “f — ked up” US Hummers in Iraq with improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and expressed an interest in providing support to terrorists in Iraq. He eventually recruited his friend Hammadi into his scheme to ship money and weapons (including machine guns, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, Stinger missiles, and C4 plastic explosives) to terrorists in Iraq. \nThe operation was a sting operation — the FBI’s source convinced Alwan and Hammadi that the money and weapons were actually going to terrorists abroad, but they were not. \nAlwan and Hammadi entered the US as refugees. They lied about their terrorism ties. \nAfter they were arrested, they admitted to using IEDs against US soldiers in Iraq and attempting to send money and weapons to Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terror group that later morphed into ISIS, according to the Department of Justice. \nAlwan was charged with conspiracy to kill US nationals abroad, distributing information on the manufacture and use of IEDs, attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to Al Qaeda in Iraq (the group that later morphed into ISIS), and conspiracy to transfer, possess, and export Stinger missiles, according to the FBI. \nHammadi was charged with attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to Al Qaeda in Iraq, conspiracy to transfer, possess, and export Stinger missiles, and making a false statement on an immigration application. \nAlwan was sentenced to 40 years in prison and Hammadi was sentenced to life. Both pleaded guilty to the charges against them. \nAt the time of their sentencing, David Hale, the US Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky, called Alwan and Hammadi “experienced terrorists who willingly and enthusiastically participated in what they believed were insurgent support operations designed to harm American soldiers in Iraq.” \nBut while Conway used their arrests to explain why Trump’s temporary travel ban is necessary to keep Americans safe, neither Alwan nor Hammadi were charged with plotting attacks in the US. \nHale also noted after Alwan and Hammadi were arrested that it was “not an indictment against a particular religious community or religion.” \nBryan Logan contributed to this report. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T17:21:26.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
