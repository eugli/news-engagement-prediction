Believing the man was having mechanical trouble, Doran got out of his patrol car to help. \nThe emergency was not one Doran expected: The man had tied one end of a rope to his vehicle and was putting the other around his neck. \n“I’m going to go,” he told the approaching officer. \nDoran acted instinctively, tackling the man, overcoming his resistance, and preventing him from leaping off the bridge. \n\"I don't think he appreciated what I did, but I made sure to not startle him and I reacted to what was happening without hesitation,\" Doran, 46, said Tuesday. \nThe incident was one of several that DRPA officials recalled at the agency’s Camden headquarters as they lauded Doran and another officer on the 150-member force for exemplary, even heroic, work. \nOfficer Laura Boucher, who routinely patrols the PATCO High-Speed Line stations, and who on a typical day might have to escort people to their cars or prevent someone from running onto the tracks, ended up saving three lives late last year. In September and October, she saved two people from overdoses, and in December she helped rescue a woman who appeared disoriented as she tried to purchase a ticket from a vending machine at the Ferry Avenue station. \n“I saw this older woman who looked disheveled and … I immediately recognized she was showing early signs of having a stroke,” Boucher said. She summoned EMTs, who took the woman to the nearby Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. \nPhiladelphia lawyer Carl Singley, a member of the Port Authority's board, called the two officers heroes. \n\"During a time when police officers are often portrayed in a negative light, it is important to recognize that the vast majority of police officers are dedicated professionals who work hard every day to protect the public,\" Singley said in an email. \nDoran, of Gloucester City, has worked for the DRPA since 2007, first as a patrol officer on the High-Speed Line and now with the Walt Whitman Bridge patrol platoon. \nBoucher, 30, a mother of two, has been an officer with the Port Authority since 2014. Before that, the West Deptford resident was a dispatcher with the authority and, earlier, an EMT. \n\"All of our officers at DRPA are highly qualified and well-trained, but these individuals’ particularly excellent instincts and compassion gave four individuals a new lease at life,\" DRPA chief executive officer John Hanson said. \nBeing heroes was farthest from their minds, Boucher and Doran said. They were just doing their jobs, each said.
