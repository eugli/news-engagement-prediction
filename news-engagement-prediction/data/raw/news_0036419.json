Lee beat Heather Bassett with an armbar submission in the third round to become the first-ever Legacy Fighting Alliance women’s flyweight champion Friday night at LFA 4 in Bossier City, La. Lee rocked Bassett repeatedly in the first round, opened up a hematoma on Bassett’s forehead in the second round and finished the job in the third. The structure of the armbar was similar in construction to the submission finish Ronda Rousey had against Cat Zingano at UFC 184 in 2015. This is Lee’s third career armbar submission finish. Andrea Lee vs Heather Bassett #LFA4 pic.twitter.com/Tw1uevTlEV — Zombie Prophet (@ZPGIFs) February 18, 2017 Lee, 28, was the Legacy FC women’s flyweight champion, but had to win this fight to become LFA champ when Legacy and RFA merged in January. The Texas native and Louisiana resident finished her last fight via first-round liver punch at Invicta FC 21 just a month ago. Lee (6-2) has the aspirations — and perhaps the formula — to become a real star at 125 pounds. The UFC does not yet have that division — only 135 and 115 for women — but Lee has expressed interest in being the first face of female flyweight in the promotion some time down the road. “I think they need a new face for the women’s 125 division,” Lee told MMA Fighting before LFA 4 . “I’m hoping that’s me. I’ve just gotta go out there and show that I can kick ass and prove that I can be that person. I have to do a lot of things in order to get there.” Winning the LFA title was another major step toward her goals.
