The 57-year-old physician has ruled out wide-scale firings and privatization of the embattled agency as ways to reduce the length of time veterans must wait for medical care.\nThe VA has nearly 370,000 employees and an annual budget of nearly $167 billion.\n___\n7:30 p.m.\nThe Senate has confirmed Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary despite complaints by Democrats that the former banker ran a \"foreclosure machine\" when he headed OneWest Bank.\nThe vote was 53-47 Monday night.\nRepublicans said Mnuchin's long tenure in finance is an ample prerequisite for the Treasury job.

Lisa Fierstein has since recanted, most recently writing to senators last month that the fast food executive was never violent.\n___\n2 p.m.\nMitt Romney is urging the Senate to confirm fast-food executive Andrew Puzder as President Donald Trump's labor secretary.\nThe 2012 GOP presidential nominee said on social media that Puzder \"knows how hard Americans work, and how much that work means to them and their families.\" He said the CEO of CKE Restaurants Inc. would help create jobs by rolling back burdensome regulations on businesses.\nPuzder's long-delayed confirmation hearing is set for Thursday.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren is leading the argument against Puzder, saying he would side with businesses over workers from atop the agency charged with enforcing workplace protections.
