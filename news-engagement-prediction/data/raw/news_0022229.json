LaMelo Ball of Chino Hills scored 92 points in a 146-123 win over Los Osos on Tuesday, giving him the fifth-highest single game scoring total in the United States over the past 25 years.According to the website Lucky's Amazing Sports List , which compiles scoring totals for any high school player in the United States with over 47 points in a game, Ball's performance is the best output since 2003 when Tigran Grigorian of Mesrobian (Pico Rivera, Calif.) scored 100 points.The only two better performances in the past 25 years occurred on the exact same night. DaJuan Wagner of Camden (N.J.), the son of former NBA guard Milt Wagner, scored 100 points on Jan. 16, 2001. But he didn't have the highest scoring output in the nation on that night.That's because Cedric Hensley of Heritage Christian (Cleveland, Texas) scored 101 points later that same evening.Ball's effort is also easily the highest-scoring performance in the nation for the 2016-17 season. He scored 20 more points than the No. 2 player on the list, which happens to be his brother LiAngelo, who scored 72 points on Nov. 30.Matthew Bradley of San Bernardino also had 72 points on Jan. 11 of this year. Of the 12 performances this year of 60 or more points in the United States this year, the Ball brothers account for four of them, with LiAngelo scoring 72, 65 and 60. LaMelo also had 41 points in one quarter, which is the fourth-highest total in U.S. history, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations Record Book. Billy Miller of Nancy (Ky.) set the record of 50 in 1976.Following are the top 10 scoring performances for the past 25 years and all scoring efforts over 60 points for the 2016-17 season.
