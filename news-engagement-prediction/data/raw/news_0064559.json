(Reuters image) \nThe preparations to celebrate the Narendra Modi government’s three years in office have started. Union Ministries and departments have been directed to start preparing their list of achievements as the government will mark third anniversary in May. The publicity drive is likely to start from March, according to The Indian Express report. Prime Minister Modi, whose demonetisation move had drawn both praises and skepticism, will want to showcase that development and anti-graft are his top most priorities. PM Modi has time to time underlined that transparency and efficiency are key issues for his government. Apart from these, he also has sent out a message that he won’t stop taking tough decisions on the economic front. \n“Let me make one thing very clear: This Government will continue to follow sound and prudent economic policies, to ensure that India has a bright future in the long run. We will not take decisions for short term political point scoring. We will not shy away from taking difficult decisions, if those decisions are in the interest of the country. Demonetisation is an example. It has short term pain but will bring long term gain,” Modi had said. \nWatch this video \nIt is likely that the Ministers and MPs will also apprise the people about the laws and welfare measures undertaken by the Modi government besides highlighting how opposition parties have stalled government’s ‘reform process’. \nWith BJP scoring a resounding victory in the Maharashtra civil polls emerging as the largest party in eight of the 10 municipal corporations while finishing a close second to bellicose ally Shiv Sena in the latter’s Mumbai bastion, PM Modi will use this as to blunt opposition parties’ attack over demonetisation issue. \nThe Modi government had organised an event at India Gate on May 28 last year to mark the second anniversary of the government. The event–‘Zara Muskura Do’ (Smile Please)– had several performances and programmes highlighting its “achievements”. The show will be beamed across the country by Doordarshan. Various schemes and programmes, particularly Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Digital India and Rural Electrification, were highlighted during the show. \nThe Modi government had celebrated its first year in office with a tagline ‘Saal Ek, Shuruaat Anek’. The Information and Broadcasting Ministry back then had asked various ministries to provide details of their achievements.
