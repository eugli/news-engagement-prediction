I think she has been framed,” said her friend, adding that she was shocked when Siti Aisyah was named as one of the suspects who killed Kim Jong-nam. \nJong-nam was the estranged half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. \nShe said Siti Aisyah did not know and had no motive to kill him. \nAlthough she had no way of finding out the truth, she believed that Siti Aisyah was innocent. \n“She is a very simple person and hoped to one day break into the entertainment industry. \n“I knew of her ambition about a year ago,” she said. \nShe added that she hoped Siti Aisyah would be released soon and reunited with her family in Indonesia. \nSiti Aisyah was one of two women suspects who police said wiped Jong-nam’s face with a deadly chemical at KLIA2 on Feb 13. \nSiti Aisyah was nabbed three days later. \nShe told Indonesian embassy officials that she was paid RM400 to take part in what she thought was a prank, and that she was under the impression the liquid given to her was baby oil.
