Read more Simple eye test could detect Parkinson’s before symptoms develop \nThe researchers examined human brain cells cultured from brains donated for the study. It was previously known that Lewy bodies accumulated in susceptible cells, but not that they could spread. \n“The implication is that if there is a spread of the Lewy bodies in the brain then the spread could be stopped early on,” Curtis said, noting that understanding this spread allows researchers to pinpoint new targets when developing treatments. \n“The traditional way of thinking about Parkinson’s was that there was a susceptible area in the brain and, if you could fix that area then the next most susceptible area would soon be affected,” he added. \n“But if the Parkinson’s disease pathology spreads then it may be possible to stop it in its tracks.” \nCurtis told the New Zealand Herald that as it takes years for symptoms of the neurological disease to develop, it gives medical professionals a window of opportunity to stop its spread. \nThe team also determined that non-neuronal cells such as blood vessels called pericytes, appear to harbour and spread the Lewy bodies rather than just the neurons, Curtis explained: “Most literature suggests that Lewy bodies cause the most problems in neurons but this paper proposes blood vessel pericytes to be significant.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:48:03.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
