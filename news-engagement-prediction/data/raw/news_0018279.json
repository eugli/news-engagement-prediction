We agreed to have a final day battle to see who could stay up the longest,\" he wrote. \n\"Barack and I both fell many times, but we kept trying again and again and made progress over the days. We were neck and neck until the last run on the last day, when I got up on the foilboard and screamed along for over 50 metres, three feet above the water. I was feeling very pleased with myself, only to look over and see Barack go 100 metres on his kiteboard! I had to doff my cap to him and celebrate his victory,\" he wrote. \nAdding, \"After all he has done for the world, I couldn’t begrudge him his well-deserved win.\" \nHe says inviting the Obamas to his island was \"a huge honor.\" \nThe video shared by Virgin Group founder has collected over 54,000 views and more than 10,000 'likes' on Instagram. Branson also shared this video on Twitter.
