First, the beauty giant came out with the lilac-tinted First Light Priming Filter . And this week, it's dropping the Becca Cosmetics Prismatic Amethyst Highlighter. This limited-edition shade is the newest addition to the cult-favorite Shimmering Skin Perfector Pressed lineup. (Last week, we found out The Bachelor 's Becca Tiley is a fan.) Becca Cosmetics is one of many companies, such as NYX, Stila, and Kevyn Aucoin, that are getting in on the highlighter trend . We're loving a bit of lavender illuminator on the top of our cheekbones to help brighten up our sallow winter skin with a unicorn-like radiance. According to the brand's latest Instagram post, the purple highlighter is formulated with duo-chrome pigments, meaning the color shifts when the light hits it at certain angles. With a name like Prismatic Amethyst Highlighter, we're excited to see if it lives up to its shining expectations. You May Also Like Makeup Stephanie Nicole Blogger Interview Kerry Cole, the company's global style director, recently revealed on her Instagram account that the highlighter is not only infused with pale lavender pearls, but also includes rose and gold. The addition of the warmer hues will hopefully make the purple highlighter accessible for all skin tones. As a pro makeup artist recently told Allure , brushing on gold or peach-hued highlighter as a base keeps the lilac shade from looking ashy and chalky on darker skin. For those hesitant about trying out the color, this product sounds like an easy way to adopt the new trend. Late last year, Becca Cosmetics released a limited-edition Rose Quartz highlighter with a similar gemstone-like design pressed onto the powder. Much to our delight, we proved that it works on all skin tones after a series of testing. As for the Prismatic Amethyst Highlighter, you'll have to stay tuned.
