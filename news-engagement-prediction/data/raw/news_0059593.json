His laboured first touches, his marksman-like potency in front of goal missing and, moreover, his diminishing spark which shone brightly for so many years. That is what being shackled to the bench can do for someone of Rooney's superstar status. An unfamiliar feeling for someone who has been so central to Premier League football since he emerged in 2002. The Evertonian who burst onto the scene at Goodison Park had a little something different. A ferocious appetite for the game and an unwavering desire to just play. That goal against Arsenal propelled him to the top of the 'England's most wanted' list for Premier League clubs. Despite David Moyes's best efforts to nurture his talents and protect the impressionable forward, the secret was out. This boy was special. He burst onto the scene at 16 when he scored a famous goal for Everton against Arsenal He signed for United in 2004 for Â£27million before scoring a hat-trick on debut One of his greatest ever goals was a volley against Newcastle back in 2005 Rooney has since been an ever-present in England's top flight. His move to Old Trafford only heightened expectation and his performances early on demanded a starting spot for Sir Alex Ferguson's side. His hat-trick against Fenerbahce on debut, his hammered volley against Newcastle United a year later, Ferguson had no choice but to play him week in, week out from an early age. For someone of lesser talent or hunger to play - after all, he even went home and played with his mates after scoring that goal against Arsenal in 2002 - it could have been easier to give a back seat. Rooney, who turned 31 in October, is second on the list of all-time Premier League appearances and third in terms of minutes played for any player before their 31st birthday.
