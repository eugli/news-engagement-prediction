No, that’s not in reference to football where he won a Super Bowl with New England and caught six passes for 70 yards. \nMitchell is ready to continue his off-field pursuits as an author. After self publishing ‘The Magician’s Hat’ while at Georgia, he already has his second project in mind. \n“I do have one and I’m ready to move forward,” Mitchell told NFL Network over the weekend, “because I feel like reading can definitely help kids and people reach their full potential.” (Photo: UGA Athletics) Not a member?
