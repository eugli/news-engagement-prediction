(Credit: The District Detroit) \nDETROIT (CBS Detroit) — When the brand new Little Caesars Arena opens this fall, officials say it will be the preeminent sports facility in the NHL and the NBA, as it will house both the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Pistons. \nThe Pistons on Monday tweeted a link to a page that takes fans through a virtual tour of the new arena, going section by section. It’s an exciting experience that shows fans what the arena will look like on Pistons gamedays, while also pricing season membership costs — which run from $616 to $55,000. \nOne thing that Olympia Entertainment has been touting as construction has gone on over the past few years is the arena’s unique “gondola” seating. The seating is an extra section of “seating suspended over the event level.” \nThis section — from what can be seen in the renders from the virtual tour — looks like it may restrict the view of some fans sitting at the very top of the upper bowl.
