The duo were joined by celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall for a fun-filled reception hosted by Camilla to launch The Great Get Together. To kick off the event the trio were invited to decorate a few of the 140 mouth-watering cupcakes - created by chefs Meera and Stuart â€“ with vanilla toppings and rice paper Union flag butterflies, to be served to the guests. \nFirst to take on the challenge was Jamie, who revealed he was \"happy to take the reins\". The food guru showed off his impressive skills, with Hugh quipping that he had set them a great challenge. When it came to Camilla's turn, she admitted: \"Icing has never quite been my forte.\" Although a few of her cake decorations turned out larger than expected, Prince Charles ' wife wasn't fazed. \"I'm doing my own, err, unique style,\" she quipped when Hugh pointed out the difference between two of her creations. VIEW GALLERY Jamie and Hugh joined the Duchess of Cornwall for the fun-filled reception \nWhen the baking fun was over, Camilla took time to thank those who had attended and share a heart-warming tribute to the late Jo Cox, who was tragically murdered last year. \"I don't want to make a speech but I would like all of you who have got a glass in their hand to raise it and drink a toast to the Big Lunch and The Great Get Together and may it go from strength to strength,\" said Camilla. \"I also hope and know that wherever Jo is now she would be looking down proudly and seeing what a wonderful job you are doing.\" VIEW GALLERY The Duchess of Cornwall put her baking skills to the test and iced some cupcakes \nThe Great Get Together is set to take place over the weekend of the 17/18 June, with tens of thousands of community get-togethers being planned across the nation from barbecues and picnics to street parties.
