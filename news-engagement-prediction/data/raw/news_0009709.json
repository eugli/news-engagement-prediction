(LUCAS JACKSON/REUTERS) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday, February 2, 2017, 8:55 PM \nAngelina Jolie ripped President Trump’s new travel ban in an editorial that draws on her knowledge and experience as the special envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. \n“Refugees are men, women and children caught in the fury of war, or the cross hairs of persecution. Far from being terrorists, they are often the victims of terrorism themselves,” the actress wrote in the New York Times Thursday. \n“I’m proud of our country’s history of giving shelter to the most vulnerable people. Americans have shed blood to defend the idea that human rights transcend culture, geography, ethnicity and religion. The decision to suspend the resettlement of refugees to the United States and deny entry to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries has been met with shock by our friends around the world precisely because of this record.” \nThe travel ban, signed Friday, put a 90-day ban on travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Thousands protest Trump's travel ban at Brooklyn Borough Hall \n“Only the most vulnerable people are put forward for resettlement in the first place: survivors of torture, and women and children at risk or who might not survive without urgent, specialized medical assistance. I have visited countless camps and cities where hundreds of thousands of refugees are barely surviving and every family has suffered,” she wrote . \n“When the United Nations Refugee Agency identifies those among them who are most in need of protection, we can be sure that they deserve the safety, shelter and fresh start that countries like ours can offer.” \nJolie’s estranged father, Jon Voight, has taken the opposite stance on the President, even attending some of Trump’s inauguration events. \nHe also spoke out in a homemade video in October praising the then-candidate. Trump signed the travel ban into effect Friday.

If we divide people beyond our borders, we divide ourselves.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:21:16.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
