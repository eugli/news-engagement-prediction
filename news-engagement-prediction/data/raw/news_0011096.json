The series materialised in a thunderclap of notoriety, with considerable hubbub attending a stage-setting scene in which two middle-aged strangers enjoyed a steamy liaison in a House of Commons broom cupboard.\nBut this emphasis on novelty nookie was quickly dispensed with. Episode three offered further confirmation that, far from an upmarket Fifty Shades of Grey , the BBC has wrought a meticulously misanthropic psychodrama with devastating insights into the human capacity for self-destruction.\nEmily Watson and Adeel Akhtar Credit: BBC T he most dazzling aspect of the Amanda Coe adaptation of Louis Doughty’s novel is that its twists genuinely arrive out of the blue. This was forcefully illustrated early in the third episode as a tender reconciliation/spontaneous snog between cheating wife Yvonne Carmichael ( Emily Watson ) and husband Gary – also cheating but sad and puppy-eyed about it – flipped in a heartbeat with police swooping in shortly afterwards to arrest her for murder.\nWe’d had an inkling her mysterious paramour Mark Costley (Ben Chaplin) had done something terrible when Yvonne drove him around for a heart-to-heart with her rapist/stalker George Selway. After an ominous delay, Costley re-emerged shifty and pallid, the suave James Bond aura that had led Yvonne to tear his trousers off in that Westminster crypt suddenly absent.\nBen Chaplin as Mark Costley Credit: BBC Y et it had never crossed Yvonne’s mind that her mercurial beau would simply bludgeon to death the loathsome Selway. This was a man who could spot a fake CCTV camera at 50 paces and had gifted her a top of the range smartphone so that they could safely schedule their hook-ups. Murder seemed so crass and unbecoming.\nA second gut-punch came as the lovers were put on trial for conspiring to bump off Selway. Costley’s legal team pleaded diminished responsibility on the grounds of a “personality disorder” that rendered their client “mentally unstable” while an old boy from MI5 told the court that, though the accused had applied for a job at the intelligence agency, he hadn’t made it through the interview process. Far from copping off with a spook with license to thrill Yvonne had been in flagrante with a fantasist.\nThere was, it is true, an occasional pungency Apple Tree Yard’s sombre gloss couldn’t quite obscure. Especially unconvincing was the relationship between Yvonne and Gary (Mark Bonnar), whose affair with a student was presented less as a betrayal than a new hobby he was trying out. Moreover, did Yvonne truly require a rom-com style sidekick in unlucky-in-love bestie Susannah (Susan Lynch)?\nRhashan Stone as Robert Credit: BBC Y et Watson remained riveting as a woman struggling to hold together the seams of a life unspooling faster than she could process. And though Chaplin was barely in the episode, as the slouched Costley he searingly communicated the turmoil of a small man whose delusions had been exposed.\nNever mind the bonking – Apple Tree Yard is a cool-to-the-touch thriller that doubles as unnerving meditation on the dangerous urges just beneath the surface of everyday life. Tomorrow comes the final instalment as Yvonne and Costley’s case reaches its denouement. However things play out, expect the results to be considerably more shocking than a quickie in the closet.\nEmily Watson's career in pictures", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:10:55.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
