Related \nHer name and occupation were correct in the montage, but the photo used was of Jan Chapman, a still-living Australian film producer. Check out the erroneous image above. \nTo confuse matters further, Patterson and Chapman worked together on “The Piano.” \nBelow is a shot of Jan Chapman, Janet Patterson and (the similarly named) Jane Campion during a promotional event for the 1993 film.

Several notable celebrities who passed in 2016, including Garry Shandling and Florence Henderson , were not included in the tribute, although they were better known for their television careers. \nBill Paxton, who died over the weekend , was also not included, but his passing was mentioned by presenter Jennifer Aniston.
