If all goes to schedule, from spring of 2018, helicopters are due to once more clatter out from the Cornish coast to the biggest island, St Mary’s, and to a second island, Tresco. \nA helicopter service – one of the few regular such passenger routes – operated for almost 50 years before British International Helicopters withdrew the service, blaming rising costs, falling passenger numbers and a dispute with a supermarket about the land in Penzance where its heliport is based.\nIslanders were aghast, pointing out that the helicopter was often their best hope of a speedy exit in a medical or other emergency. Since then the islands have been accessible by boat and fixed-wing plane. Some tourists for whom the helicopter ride was an important part of their trip to the far south-west of the British Isles began to stay away. \nRobert Dorrien-Smith, who owns the island of Tresco and is one of the main investors in the new project, said: “Naturally, we are delighted. Today’s decision marks the start of the project that we believe will bring about a revival for the islands and dramatic improvements for their residents, businesses and visitors.”\n“The volume – but also the content – of the public support demonstrates without a doubt the importance of this project to the future of tourism on Scilly, and in Cornwall as a whole.”\nPenzance town councillor Dick Cliffe said: “This is a strategically important development for the Isles of Scilly and it provides important economic benefits for Penzance. The approval of Penzance Heliport is a shot in the arm for Penzance, and is potentially transformational for the Isles of Scilly.”\nA company called Penzance Heliport Ltd is behind the project and modern AW139 helicopters will be flown. An adult return fare is expected to be in the region of £220.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T15:14:51.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
