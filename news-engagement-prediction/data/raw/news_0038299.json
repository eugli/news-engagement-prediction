Israel will not annex the West Bank because adding 2.5 million Palestinian citizens would undo the Jewish state. It prefers to oppress and humiliate 2.5 million nonvoting noncitizens. Settlement growth will continue, as it has for almost 50 years, and the more than 400,000 settlers in the West Bank will convey better than words what Israel really thinks of Palestinian statehood. The Palestinian Authority , headed by Mahmoud Abbas, will remain a monument to impotence. Palestinian fury will periodically erupt. Netanyahu was explicit. He wants a Jewish state that retains “the overriding security control over the entire area west of the Jordan River.” That, he claimed, was what he’s been saying for years. Wrong. When he first reluctantly admitted the possibility of two states in 2009, he insisted Palestine be “demilitarized.” That’s not the same as total Israeli security control. Netanyahu is now close to Bennett’s position: Some form of Palestinian self-rule (and they can call it what they like) on whatever disjointed fragments of the West Bank remain once Israel has satisfied its security needs. As Daniel Shapiro, the former American ambassador to Israel, told me: “A two-state solution must assure Israel’s security. But it must also pass the laugh test of a sovereign Palestinian state.” Netanyahu’s proposal does not pass the test of what Palestinians will ever accept. Enter the la-la-land of the “outside-in” regional approach to peace, whereby Israel’s “newfound Arab partners,” in Netanyahu’s words, unlock the impasse by pressuring Palestinians to compromise. Sure, bound by shared anti-Iranian concerns, some Arab states have found intelligence cooperation with Israel useful, but their sympathy ends where Palestinian humiliation begins. Netanyahu is going to have to put something on the table: a halt to settlement growth; Palestinian economic development in the large Israeli-controlled West Bank area known as “Area C”; agreement on borders at the pre-1967 lines with agreed territorial swaps. Something! Arabs, whatever millennial loathing they harbor for Iran, have not suddenly swooned into Israel’s arms. A sickly arrogance pervaded the Trump-Netanyahu love fest. Their shared contempt for the Palestinian people is obvious. The Trump administration has just blocked the appointment of Salam Fayyad to head the U.N. mission in Libya on the grounds that, well, he’s a Palestinian. No matter that he’s a widely respected, American-educated, former Palestinian prime minister who has been a tireless and innovative seeker of a two-state peace. Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the U.N., said, “The United States does not currently recognize a Palestinian state or support the signal this appointment would send.” What signal, pray? Trump should lift the American objection to Fayyad right now if he’s serious about a deal. \nAdvertisement This is prejudice as policy, the worst of Trump (with his grotesque deflection of a question about anti-Semitism into a celebration of his victory not far behind). It suggests his interesting one-state two-state provocation will lead nowhere. \nYou can follow me on Twitter ( @NYTimesCohen ) or join me on Facebook . \nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T12:35:26.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
