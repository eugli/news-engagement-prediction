In an article posted on CNN’s website, Obeidallah wrote, “By inviting “alt right” (aka white supremacist) darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as “Milo”) onto his HBO show Friday night, Bill Maher could’ve seized a great opportunity to expose Yiannopoulos’ history of hate”\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nYet Obeidallah himself has in the past been accused of making hateful remarks. During the run-up to the 2012 Presidential election, Obeidallah appeared on Melissa Harris-Perry’s panel on MSNBC where she and her panel of five, including Obeidallah, ridiculed Mitt Romney’s black grandchild as something “that’s not like the others.” The only reason for the ridicule of the young child seemed to be purely based on the race of Kieran Romney, the former Massachusetts governor’s adopted grandchild.\nObeidallah at one point implied that the adopted child was a token, saying ”I think this picture is great. It really sums up the diversity of the Republican party, the RNC. At the convention, they find the one black person.”\nHarris-Perry and Obeidallah both later apologized for their remarks.\nWatch Obeidallah’s comments on Mitt Romneys grandson below.\nRead More Stories About: Milo , Tech , CNN , Daily Beast , Dean Obeidallah , Milo", "external_links": ["http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fmilo%2F2017%2F02%2F19%2Fdean-obeidallah-calls-milo-white-supremacist-darling-calls-bill-maher-shameful%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Comedian+Who+Called+Milo+%E2%80%98Racist%E2%80%99+Once+Suggested+Mitt+Romney%E2%80%99s+Black+Grandson+Was+A+Token", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fmilo%2F2017%2F02%2F19%2Fdean-obeidallah-calls-milo-white-supremacist-darling-calls-bill-maher-shameful%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Comedian+Who+Called+Milo+%E2%80%98Racist%E2%80%99+Once+Suggested+Mitt+Romney%E2%80%99s+Black+Grandson+Was+A+Token&shortener=bitly", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/DfCy1nOVK9k?feature=oembed", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fmilo%2F2017%2F02%2F19%2Fdean-obeidallah-calls-milo-white-supremacist-darling-calls-bill-maher-shameful%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Comedian+Who+Called+Milo+%E2%80%98Racist%E2%80%99+Once+Suggested+Mitt+Romney%E2%80%99s+Black+Grandson+Was+A+Token", "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/18/opinions/mahers-shameful-mainstreaming-of-yiannopoulos/index.html"], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:54:54.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
