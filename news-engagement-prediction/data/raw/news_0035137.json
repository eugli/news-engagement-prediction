It was a petty dispute that, as prosecutor Vicki Faulkner once said, never brought anyone money or fame. \nYet, as prosecutor Shane Parker argued in his closing argument, Garland felt “dominated and wronged” and nourished the grudge against Alvin over the years. \nBy December 2013, his Internet searches showed, Garland’s resentment broadened to include Kathy at about the same time he was developing an unholy interest in bondage and torture. \nIf Nathan couldn’t have been part of Garland’s larger plan — it was an impromptu sleepover, with the little boy begging to stay at his grandparents’ place because the Likneses had sold the house and were moving to the Edmonton area — jurors nonetheless found Garland had had time enough to make a deliberate decision to kill Nathan too. \nAt the first bloodied scene, the Liknes’ house, Garland was as Parker once put it, “mistake-free.” Not a trace of him, no DNA or hair or fibre, was ever found in the house. \nBut as the jurors learned, Garland had in his storehouse of disturbing supplies the protective “bunny suits” forensic police officers wear to prevent contamination, and he was known, both within his family and via his web searches on police techniques, as a compulsive and meticulous researcher and planner. \nHe emerged as the key suspect only after surveillance video in the Likneses’ neighbourhood showed a green Ford pickup creeping through the area in the early hours of June 30. Police released pictures of the truck, and Garland’s sister Patti told police she thought it was his. \nAt the 40-acre farm, Garland was either uncharacteristically careless, or more likely, ran out of time. \nWhile he was able to burn the three bodies and much of the evidence, proof that the grandparents and the little boy they loved was everywhere — Kathy’s DNA on a meat hook and a corner of the truck’s license plate, and the DNA of all three, and Garland’s too, in a pair of his rubber boots. \nThe one-time medical student — he suffered a breakdown in first year, his mother testified, and never returned – was also unlucky. A survey aircraft with a sophisticated camera just happened to be over the farm on July 1 and July 2 that year. \nPhotographs from the first day showed two unmistakably recognizable adults lying on their stomachs, naked but for the adult diapers that had become part of his fantasy for “bound and diapered” adult women. Beside them, curled up, the image less clear, was a smaller figure Parker and Faulkner told the jurors was Nathan. \nUnusually, it was Parker who figured out what the photographs showed, and made the “disclosure” to lead Detectives Lee Treit and John Orr — a reverse of the norm. \nBut the bodies were gone in photos from the following day. \nOutside court Thursday, Parker was sombre as he remembered the little boy who never had a chance to grow up (“Who knows what Nathan would have grown up to be?”) and his grandparents, on the brink of retirement and a new phase of their lives. \nJennifer O’Brien, the Liknes’ daughter and Nathan’s mother, and her husband Rod have suffered “the loss of three critical people in their family,” he said. Parker also praised “the tremendous police investigation” and the enormous help of the public throughout. \nGarland will be sentenced Friday. \nThough the sentence for first-degree murder is automatic — life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years – Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench Judge David Gates will have to decide if Garland should serve the sentences concurrently, as is the norm, or consecutively, as a 2011 amendment to the Criminal Code allows. \nAs Shane Parker told the jurors in closing arguments, “There was never a ransom note. This was not for profit. It was spite.” \nIt was for nothing. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:40:40.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
