Not today. Things are heating up #Bethany #control.\" \nIt comes after the disturbing scenes show on Friday, which saw schoolgirl Bethany [Lucy Fallon] lose her virginity to Nathan after his partner in crime Mel got her drunk at a nightclub.

It's the most important storyline I've ever had. \n\"It's massively important I get this right for them. We want to reach out to people to let them know help is out there, and to tell ­abusers they can't get away with it. \n\"Half the problem is getting people to come forward. It's been said that for every one ­person reporting abuse, another seven don't.\" Bethany [Lucy Fallon] lost her virginity to Nathan last week (Photo: ITV) \nChris also said the upcoming plot could serve as an eye-opener for some TV viewers. \nHe added: \"The stereotype is of this older man with a sticky suit, bad hair and bad teeth. \n\"But often the reality is very different. The perpetrators could be any age, any colour or class, and so can the people affected.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T18:52:13.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
