Players age 12 and younger can have locked privacy settings to prevent contact from people they don’t know. \nKidspot has contacted the makers of Roblox for comment. \nThis article was originally published on Kidspot ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:03:20.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
