Share on Twitter Print This Post \nAs Donald Trump continues to ignore the wave of anti-Semitism that has swept across the country in recent weeks, a new round of attacks on the Jewish community unfolded Monday from coast to coast. \nAccording to the JCC Association of North America, a total of 11 Jewish community centers received bomb threats on Monday alone – the latest in a series of incidents that have taken place over the past several weeks. \nAs JCC noted today, the bomb threats come “in the aftermath of three waves of bomb threats in January (Jan. 9, Jan. 18, and Jan. 31), resulting in, through today, 69 incidents at 54 JCCs in 27 states and one Canadian province in total.” \nThe threats all turned out to be hoaxes, the organization noted, but the heightened level of anti-Semitic activity across the country is troubling. \n“While we are relieved that all such threats have proven to be hoaxes and that not a single person was harmed, we are concerned about the anti-Semitism behind these threats, and the repetition of threats intended to interfere with day-to-day life,” read the statement from JCC. \nAlso on Monday, Fox News reported another incident in St. Louis in which more than 100 tombstones were damaged at a Jewish cemetery.

We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers. #JCC \n— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 20, 2017 \nAt this hour, though, there has still been no condemnation offered directly from the President of the United States, despite his willingness to express outrage over things that don’t exist, like widespread voter fraud and fake terrorist attacks. \nWhen given the opportunity to directly address the disturbing spike in anti-Semitic activity during last week’s unhinged press conference, Trump chose to ignore the issue and instead attack the Jewish reporter who raised it. \nAfter the childish and unstable president whined about the question and claimed to be the “the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life,” he ordered the journalist to “sit down.” \nUnfortunately, this is just par for the course for this president. He ignores actual problems that demand real leadership and instead latches on to debunked conspiracy theories because it satisfies his supporters and aligns with his perverted worldview. \nIf there was ever a time for Donald Trump to use the megaphone of his Twitter account to express anger and disappointment over something that is actually happening in the real world, now would be it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:59:36.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
