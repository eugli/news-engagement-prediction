She was on her moped when she was hit by D'Elisa, who had run a red light, according to the Telegraph . Lawyers for Di Lello, who was a semi-professional footballer, said their client feared the man who killed his wife would not be brought to justice and is thought to have taken the law into his own hands. Italo D'Elisa was gunned down in the street Prosecutors have called the shooting a 'tragedy within a tragedy' after the death toll doubled. Di Lello's lawyer Giovanni Carella told the Telegraph his client was in shock and depressed about his wife, but said: 'I never got the impression that he was planning a vendetta like this. 'I was dumbfounded when I found out. 'He had no experience of handling firearms. 'But his psychological state was very fragile.'
