Elsewhere, Jenelle Evans was convinced her ex Nathan Griffith was trying to win her back, but was he?

Will she ever be on equally good of terms with Javi, with whom she shares son Lincoln? Maybe, if she ever tries to speak to him! PHOTOS: Celebrity Splits of 2016 \nBack home, Jo got into an argument with his girlfriend, Vee Torres, who wanted him to make his custody agreement with Kailyn more concrete because Kailyn “changes randomly.” \n“I feel like our life is kinda like based around her, and I don’t like that,” Vee vented. What did we tell you about exes? \nJo spoke to Kailyn, who said she was grateful he’d come to her, but they didn’t make any big changes to their custody agreement. PHOTOS: Biggest Costar Feuds Ever! These Celebrities Can’t Stand Each Other Off-Screen \nIs Chelsea’s Bachelorette Party Really 100 Percent Boy-Free? \nChelsea Houska might have postponed her wedding reception after learning she was pregnant, but the bachelorette party was still on! Her friends Chelsey Grace and Brittnee Short took her on a trip for the “low-key” event. \nIt was sort of low-key because it took place in a remote cabin, but also a little high-key, since there were still plenty of inflatable penises hanging around. As relaxed as the vibe was, Chelsea’s friends totally failed at her one request: She asked them not to say anything about her future baby’s gender in front of the MTV cameras. They only lasted about a day before they accidentally let it slip as they drove that she’d need to get the new baby suspenders for her wedding, causing a producer to yell through the dashboard-mounted camera, “Does this mean there will be antlers in the nursery?!” \nShe wouldn’t confirm if she was having a boy, but since this was filmed months ago, we can go ahead and confirm that for you. Chelsea MTV \nDoes Leah Have Two Sick Kids? \nDuring the last episode, Leah Messer was in tears over daughter Ali’s muscular dystrophy and deteriorating health. During a routine doctor’s visit, Ali was shown to be stable, and Leah was told to be hopeful. Still, moments later, the doctor suggested testing Ali’s twin, Aleeah, for the gene, causing Leah to worry about something she hadn’t even thought to worry about before. \n“The possibility of her even having it is worrisome to me,” Leah said on the phone to a friend before vowing to not “overthink it.” Leah MTV \nIs Nathan Still in Love With Jenelle? \nJenelle’s whole plot this episode revolved around her conviction that Nathan wanted her back. Where did she get that idea? Oh, he texted her and asked her to call so they could talk about their son, Kaiser, and come to an agreement about the best ways to discipline him, so Kaiser wouldn’t have such a hard time adjusting whenever he switches houses.
