She was the person who introduced my parents,\" Mr Noyce told AAP. \n\"She was always included in all the stories when I was growing it. It always felt like she was in the room.\" \nIt's an experience Mr Noyce shares with many of the descendants of the Australian nurses. Australian nurse Sister Kath Neuss was among 21 Australian nurses who were killed during the Bangka Island Massacre. Source: AAP \nOn the morning of February 16, 1942, the women found themselves marching out to sea on Bangka Island while Japanese guns were levelled at their backs. \nTwenty-one were killed on Radji Beach, on what is now Indonesia, but one survived - Sister Vivian Bullwinkel - also known as 'Bully'. \nShe went on to tell of the horror of what became known as the Bangka Island Massacre, writing to the women's families after the war ended. \nShe would also go on to give evidence at the International War Crimes Tribunal in Tokyo.
