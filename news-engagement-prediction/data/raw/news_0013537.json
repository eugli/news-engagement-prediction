I wasn't checking for lumps intentionally as I would usually do that in the shower.' Miss Browning, who works for Marie Curie UK, said she 'panicked' but was comforted by boyfriend Tom Auston, 28. Her mother booked an emergency doctor's appointment for the same day. Positive: Miss Browning will undergo chemotherapy but is focusing on helping others Next step: Hayley, pictured left and right with Tom, will undergo a course of chemotherapy With the support of friends and family, Miss Browning decided to share her experience on Facebook. 'I had always read advice that you should check for lumps in the shower, but mine couldn't be felt standing up at all,' she said. In the Facebook post, she wrote: 'I'm hoping to share a little trick of mine with as many people as possible, which could potentially help save someone's life. 'Most websites tell you to check for lumps in the shower but if I had followed this advice, the lump may have grown too large to be treatable. Not even the surgeon could feel my lump when I was standing up. 'So, this is a call out to all women to check for lumps lying down, as well as standing up. Long journey ahead: Hayley and Tom on holiday in the Lake District in November last year 'As I think about my long journey ahead and the chemotherapy I will undertake, I want to reach as many people with this message and help find more #laidbacklumps.' Miss Browning said she had been 'completely overwhelmed' by the response. She added: 'Together, even if we have helped just one other person in some way, then it's all been worth doing in my opinion. ' Dr Jana Witt of Cancer Research UK said: 'It's important for women to get to know their breasts, and to talk to a doctor if they notice any unusual or persistent changes. 'There's no need to check them regularly in a set way or at a set time, just have a look and a feel every now and then and get to know what's normal for you. 'And it's not just about lumps. Other symptoms, such as a change in the size, shape or feel of a breast, skin changes such as dimpling or a rash, or changes to a nipple, could also be a sign of the disease. It's far more likely to be something less serious than cancer, but it's better to get checked out.'
