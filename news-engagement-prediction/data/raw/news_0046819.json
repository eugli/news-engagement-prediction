The changing rooms for me were fantastic -- the closer you are, the more united you are when you go out there. \n\"They were organised and had a huge desire. If we were not mentally prepared we would not have gone through today.\" \nArsenal have been drawn against non-league Lincoln City in the quarter-finals, a team that became the first minor league side to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals in 103 years when the beat the Premier League's Burnley in the last round.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:41:28.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
