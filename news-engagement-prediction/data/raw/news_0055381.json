The federal Bureau of Prisons currently holds 12 private prison contracts, housing nearly 21,000 inmates across the country.\nThe Justice Department began issuing contracts with private prisons when the prison population boosted up to 800 percent between 1980 and 2013.\nNow, with President Trump’s strict immigration policies on the horizon, private prisons could make major profits in the coming years. Earlier this week, the Trump administration ordered Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcemen t to quickly detain and deport undocumented immigrants living in the country.\nThousands attend Women's March on Washington 18 show all Thousands attend Women's March on Washington 1/18 Protesters gather outside the White House at the finish of the Women's March on Washington on January 21, 2017 in Washington, DC.
