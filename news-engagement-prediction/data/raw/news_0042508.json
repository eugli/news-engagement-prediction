Sanjay Bhandari, accused of scams during the UPA tenure in India was found to be hiding in London on Monday. A CNN report reveals that Bhandari had escaped despite 2-3 lookout notices filed against him. Bhandari has allegedly played the role of a middleman in many deals during the 10-year rule of the UPA government, which include the much controversial Pilatus deal. According to reports, the Income Tax department had registered a case against Bhandari under the Black Money Act. Another case had been lodged against him by the Delhi Police under the Official Secrets Act. The Enforcement Directorate is also known to have registered a complaint against him for money laundering.\nAnd while there are 3 big cases pending against him, it is unsure as to who helped him sneak from the country and into England and what route he had taken to reach his destination. Although speculations suggest that he might have taken a Nepal route. Bhandari is known to have played a major role in various arms deals during the UPA regime. Meanwhile, the government or the officials have not said anything about their plans to get him back to the country for prosecution. It must be noted that Bhandari is the second after Vijay Mallya to be seeking refugee in London. It has been quite difficult for the government in the past to extradite former IPL chairman Lalit Modi and Kingfisher baron Vijay Mallya.\nAlso watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:14:38.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
