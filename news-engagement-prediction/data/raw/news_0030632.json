Muntean says she doesn't want her tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood. ( April Dembosky/KQED ) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) \nPro-life and pro-choice demonstrators clashed outside the Planned Parenthood clinic in San Francisco Saturday, arguing over whether taxpayer money should go to a women’s health organization that provides abortion. \n“We think that the other side has some valid concerns about women’s health,” said Terrisa Bukovanic, president of Pro-Life Future San Francisco. “However we are absolutely not OK with federal funds going to an organization that profits from human demise.” \nThe rally was one of 200 organized across the country – about 30 of them in California – by anti-abortion activists, urging Congress to cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood. In several locations, including Denver and St. Paul, Minn., demonstrators were outnumbered by counter protesters. \nIn California, Planned Parenthoods clinics receive $260 million per year in federal funds, though that money is restricted to providing birth control counseling, STD testing, and cervical cancer screening, not abortion. \nOutside the San Francisco clinic, about 40 pro-life protesters prayed and sang Ave Maria, while more than 200 counter protesters gathered on the other side of the sidewalk, shouting slogans like, “Pro-life, that’s a lie! You don’t care if women die!” \nKQED News on Twitter \nProtestors on both sides of the abortion debate protest in front of the San Francisco Planned Parenthood clinic (via @adembosky) https://t.co/vTOy1XbE3W \nWomen on both sides wore t-shirts that said, “This is what a feminist looks like,” including Bukovinac. She said even though the back and forth got tense at times, she welcomed it. \n“Rarely do we see a significant counter protest. It’s almost always just us talking to ourselves, which is kind of pointless because we want to be having this national discussion,” she said. “It’s exciting to see people coming out who are also passionate about what they believe in, just like we are.” \nA few Planned Parenthood supporters walked down the sidewalk waving 20 dollar bills at the protestors, then went into the clinic to make a donation. \n“This Planned Parenthood was definitely there for me as a young woman and I believe it should be there for all women anywhere,” said pro-choice protestor Marian Doub. “I watch the anti-choice people out here periodically and don’t feel like we’ve done enough to counter their movement. We need to step it up.” \nPolice were careful to keep protestors on either side of the sidewalk away from each other. But one pro-life demonstrator, Eva Muntean, broke away at the request of two young women on the pro-choice side. They talked for 20 minutes, sharing their views and personal stories, debating policy and statistics. In the end, no minds were changed, no opinions swayed. But they thanked each other for the civil conversation. \n“I totally respect their right to be here,” Muntean said. “I wouldn’t want it any other way.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T09:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:25:24.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
