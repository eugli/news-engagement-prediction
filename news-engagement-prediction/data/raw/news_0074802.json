By Mary Papenfuss \nHere’s an idea: Since Donald Trump has announced he’s ditching the annual White House Correspondents Dinner in April, maybe a substitute could take his place. Who better than Alec Baldwin , whose impersonations of Trump on “Saturday Night Live” are growing ever-more eerily close to the real thing? \nActor Zach Braff came up with the brainstorm. After Trump tweeted that he wouldn’t be attending the dinner, Braff quickly tweeted to Baldwin that it was time to “suit up.” Other Baldwin fans chimed in. I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! — Zach Braff (@zachbraff) February 25, 2017 Yuge opening for Alec Baldwin to get some extra work that evening... https://t.co/cQoERmmLf6 — Sam 🇺🇸 JB & MDNA💙 (@SamuelGiove) February 25, 2017 \nNo word yet from Baldwin. Someone who would be extremely unpleased about the substitution would be Trump, who absolutely loathes Baldwin’s impersonations of him and just doesn’t think they’re ... well ... funny . Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me.Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016 \nTrump has become the first president in over three decades to duck out of the event which features a comedian roast of the chief executive. \nIt’s not a huge surprise Trump is dodging the event, given his repeated attacks on the media that reached a kind of defcon-5 calling the press the “enemy of the people.” After his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, several media outlets, including the Huffington Post, were barred from a press briefing . \nThe president’s attacks had the media rethinking the whole dinner affair . The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and Bloomberg had canceled their famous event parties, and CNN was considering skipping the sit-down. Comedian Samantha Bee announced early this year that she was planning an alternative event on the same night with the tentative title: “Not the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.” \nThe event by the White House Correspondents Association , which hosts D.C. journalists, celebrities and Beltway newsmakers, first began in 1921. The last president to skip out was Ronald Reagan in 1981 because he was still rattled by an assassination attempt — but he managed to phone in his comments. \nTrump has attended the dinner before — and was ribbed from the podium by former president Obama in 2011 for peddling the “birther” tall-tale that Obama had not been born in America. \nWho knows? If Baldwin decides to pick up the gauntlet perhaps there would also be an open invitation for “SNL” pal Beck Bennett to stand in for Russian President Vladimir Putin.
