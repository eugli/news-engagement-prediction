While this may sound appealing to some, it defies law enforcement logic. With agents wasting time and resources going after undocumented moms, dads, and neighbors, it becomes easier for undocumented gang members, traffickers, and violent criminals to evade detection. And what happens to DACA recipients -- those brought to this country illegally as children and granted temporary deportation relief since 2012 under Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy? Trump recently said that he wants to deal with their situation \"with heart.\" He said that their situation is a \"very difficult thing for me as I love these kids, I love these kids.\" Really? While the immigration enforcement memo leaves DACA in place for now, a footnote states that it will be addressed in the future. Moreover, the immigration enforcement memo notes that \"The Department will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.\" Taken together, this amounts to a chilling ambiguity for the 740,000 recipients of DACA. So despite Trump's expression of empathy, his memos say otherwise. At best, they tell these young people that immigration agents will deal with them later. The immigration enforcement memo outlines plans to expand the use of local law enforcement partnerships in fighting illegal immigration. If you think this sounds like a good idea, think again. These partnerships, known as 287(g) programs, were wisely phased out by the Obama administration because they did not work .
