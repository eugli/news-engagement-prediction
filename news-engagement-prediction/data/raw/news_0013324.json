The first ad was a statement — a sixty-second proclamation that Alfa Romeo is back in America after a two-decade absence. That it’s ready to “once again ride on the backs of dragons.” When we were young, we wanted to be epic. We rode on the backs of dragons and dreamt of flying cars. We were taught that power was nothing more than being the strongest guy in the room, but brute strength was not enough. We had to learn grace. We found that staying true to who you are is all that matters; that balance isn’t found, it’s created. And the ability to reinvent ourselves is the most human trait of all. All this to grow, fearless, so that when we got the chance, we could deliver that flying car and once again ride on the backs of dragons. Then came the letter — a missive from Giulia, the Alfa Romeo sports sedan that launched last year, saying goodbye to “predictable.” Dear predictable, There’s no other way to say this: it’s over. I’ve found a permanent escape from monotony. Someone who desires more than just beauty alone. Who prefers elusive over usual. Powerful over passive. Together we are perfectly balanced, our senses awake, our hearts racing as one. I know this is sudden, but you know what they say: if you love something, set it free. See you around. Giulia Finally we have Mozzafiato, Italian for “breathtaking.” Another hit for the Giulia, completing the threesome and welcoming Alfa back to the US. Mozzafiato. It means to take one’s breath away. With its appearance. With its presence. With its power. Mozzafiato. Giulia from Alfa Romeo. Some cars take your breath away. Only one gives it back. I’m the proud owner of an utterly amazing (and utterly flawed) Alfa Romeo 4C . The 4C is a niche sports car, but it was a toe in the water for the Italian carmaker. Alfa has bigger aspirations with the Giulia, looking to take on luxury sports sedans like the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes C-Class. I haven’t driven the Giulia, but if the reviews are any indication, Alfa Romeo is back — and every other luxury carmaker (and their customers) should sit up and take notice.
