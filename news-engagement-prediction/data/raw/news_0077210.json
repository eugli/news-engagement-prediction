(Photo: Getty Images North America) \nNow, people have joked that Damon's long-running fake feud with Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel - and his newfound doppelganger - mean he could have been involved. \n\"Anyone else think @briancullinan_ and #MattDamon look alike? I think #envelopegate was to sabotage @jimmykimmel,\" one fan teased. \nMeanwhile, after the biggest ever gaffe in the history of the Oscars, Matt Damon has said \"that's what they get for hiring Jimmy Kimmel\". \nThe actor jokingly pointed the finger of blame at the talk show host, who took the reigns at the 89th Academy Awards on Sunday. \nJimmy repeatedly mocked the Martian star during the ceremony at Los Angeles Dolby Theatre and Matt has continued their long-running fake feud by saying it was his fault that La La Land was wrongly announced as Best Picture when it was in fact Moonlight.

That's what they get for hiring Jimmy. You know, they got what they paid for.\" \nJimmy, 49, couldn't resist taking shots at his weight, career choices and lack of success during his stint at the helm of the prestigious ceremony. \nIn his opening monologue, he said: \"Tonight, in spirit of healing and bringing people together, I would like to bury the hatchet with someone I've had issues with. I would. Matt Damon. \n\"I've known Matt for a long time now. I've known Matt so long, when I first met Matt, I was the fat one, OK? It's true. And we've had problems. He's a selfish person.
