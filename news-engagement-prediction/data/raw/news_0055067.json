Reckless pranksters climb to top of Canary Wharf skyscraper \nMrs Gallagher, a croupier, told the newspaper: “It's a double-edge sword. Nobody wants their child risking life and limb. \n“His [older] brother was the freerunner in the family but he gave it up because decided he didn't want to kill himself. Harry never had that fear. \n“He just has this passion for it. He is fearless. You can’t stop that journey.” \nMrs Gallagher said she had “reconciled” herself to the risks taken by her son and was helping him to run an online shop where he sells “Night Scape” merchandise. \nAfter the video of Mr Gallagher climbing One Canada Square was uploaded to YouTube, the owners of the building said they were investigating alongside police.
