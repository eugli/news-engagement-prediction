Warner Bros. Gal Gadot goes to battle as Wonder Woman in Warner Bros.' superhero tentpole 'Wonder Woman.' (Photo: Clay Enos & DC Comics) \nProgress, however slight, is being made for women behind the camera. \nA disheartening study by San Diego State University's Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film revealed last month that only 7% of the 250 highest-grossing films of 2016 had female directors. Despite strides in diversity in last week's Oscar nominations , the best director category is an all-male field for a seventh consecutive year, with the overall representation of women in behind-the-scenes categories down 2% . But there's reason to be hopeful for 2017, with movie website Film School Rejects finding that 66 features with female directors are expected to hit theaters this year (up from 40 the year prior). \nWe highlight 10 women helming independent comedies, awards hopefuls and studio tentpoles that you should keep an eye on. \nLucia Aniello (Photo: Craig Barritt, Getty Images for AOL) Lucia Aniello \nThe Upright Citizens Brigade alum, who has cut her teeth writing and directing episodes of Comedy Central's Broad City , takes her talents to the big screen as director/co-writer of Rock That Body (June 16). The raunchy comedy stars Scarlett Johansson, Kate McKinnon and Ilana Glazer as college friends whose bachelorette weekend goes haywire when a male stripper turns up dead. \nNiki Caro (Photo: Jason Kempin, Getty Images) Niki Caro \nThe Whale Rider filmmaker could return with two female-driven movies this year. First up there's World War II drama The Zookeeper's Wife (March 31), with Jessica Chastain as the real-life savior of hundreds of Jews and animals during the Nazi invasion in Poland. Also on the docket is biopic Callas , expected later this year, starring Noomi Rapace as opera singer Maria Callas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:10:35.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
