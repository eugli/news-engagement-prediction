This, the court said, was sufficient to presume they were unlawfully acquired. \nPresident Marcos and his family amassed billions during his 21 years in power. They fled to Hawaii in 1986 when the army and Filipinos turned against him in a bloodless revolution. \nWhen Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos arrived in the US, they brought with them hundreds of pieces of jewellery and a couple dozen gold bricks , reportedly wedding anniversary presents from Imelda to her husband. \nBack in the Philippines , Imelda’s shoe collection was displayed at the presidential palace as a symbol of her lavish lifestyle.

Malasig/EPA \nHer jewellery collection, now stored at the central bank, includes a golden belt with a diamond buckle, necklaces, brooches, earrings and gems. \nOther items, such as 200 artworks including paintings by Van Gogh, Picasso and Rembrandt, remain missing. A government body tasked with finding the “ill-gotten wealth” has traced money through jurisdictions all over the world. The $10bn question: what happened to the Marcos millions? Read more \nImelda Marcos returned to Manila in 1991 after her husband died in Honolulu and fought off several corruption cases, including one that could have seen her jailed for up to 50 years. \nPrevious governments have pledged to sell off the jewellery but Marcos has been persistent, taking the case to the supreme court in 2014. \nThe Marcos’s remain a powerful political family in the Philippines. Imelda, now 87, is serving her third term in the house of representatives and her son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, narrowly lost the vice-presidential election last year. \nThe family has found an ally in President Rodrigo Duterte, a strongman nicknamed “the Punisher”, who took power last year and has overseen a war on drugs that has killed thousands of people. \nDuterte also endorsed a controversial movement to give Ferdinand Marcos a hero’s burial with military honours last year. His closeness to the Marcos family has cast doubt over whether the plan to auction off the jewellery will go ahead.
