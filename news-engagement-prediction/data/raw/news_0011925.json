(Photo: Mark Evrard / VarsityViews) \nINDIANAPOLIS – Ask an opposing coach what makes North Central’s top-ranked and undefeated girls basketball team such a juggernaut and be prepared for a long answer. \nCathedral coach Ed Frieje listed 10 factors after his team’s 56-41 loss to North Central in the Class 4A Sectional 10 championship at Warren Central. \nThen, he summed it up: “They’re tough,” Frieje said. “They are undefeated for a reason.” \nThe Panthers (26-0) wrapped up their first sectional title since the 2011-12 team that won a state title, pulling away from Cathedral in a game that was closer throughout than most expected. North Central’s relentless pressure — one of Frieje’s factors — eventually wore down Cathedral, which committed 22 turnovers. \nNorth Central will play Sectional 9 champion New Castle (16-9) in a regional semifinal Saturday at Decatur Central. Pike and Brownsburg are on the other side of the regional bracket. \nAfter a 52-43 win over rival Lawrence North on Friday , North Central found itself in a tussle with Cathedral in the first half. Irish junior guard Keya Patton scored 10 points to ignite her team to a 26-19 lead early in the second quarter. \nBut with 6 minutes left in the half, Patton picked up her third foul and watched the remainder of the half from the bench. North Central took a 32-28 lead to halftime and Cathedral could never find its rhythm again. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
