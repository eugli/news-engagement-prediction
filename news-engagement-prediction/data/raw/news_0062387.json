Yes, you can. The first time getting waxed in an area hurts the most and does tend to get less painful each time after. Hard to believe when your hair has just been ripped out for the first time, but it's true. Here are some simple steps you can take to reduce waxing pain, whether you have been waxed before or not...or even a Brazilian. Anton Zoghi/iStock 1. Do dull the nerves \nPrior to waxing apply something to desensitize the skin ( see products ). Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the exact wait time and specific application. \nConsider taking a pain reliever (not aspirin, it thins the blood) about 30 - 45 minutes before your wax. This is especially helpful when getting waxed above the lip, chest, bikini and genital areas- which top the list as the most pain-provoking areas. \ncontinue reading below our video Minimize Pain During Waxing 2. Do seek a professional \nIt doesn't mean just anybody licensed (like an esthetician or cosmetologist), but someone also experienced. They will use the wax, or multiple waxes, best suited for the hair, apply the right thickness of wax and hold the skin firm pulling the product off in the correct direction at the right speed. This is important for any waxing but more crucial when receiving a bikini wax, especially a Brazilian. \nGood places to find someone crafty are where they only or mostly provide waxing.

You might benefit from taking something like Tums 20 minutes before your service to reduce acidity and therefore reduce skin's sensitivity. 4. Do use a body scrub \nWhile the skin on the face is generally exfoliated enough in terms of waxing, the body often needs a little extra help. A somewhat gritty but gentle body scrub will help rid dead cells around pores and hair follicle , providing an easier exit. \nMade for use before waxing, try Relax and Wax Scrub Me Luscious Lemon Drop which won't leave the skin greasy or oily and helps prevent ingrown hair . 5. Don't apply astringent or toner pre wax \nThese tighten the pores and can make a firmer hold on the hair follicle. So hold off right before waxing. Although toners can be good for the skin, especially alcohol-free after the hair has been removed. 6. Don't use ice for numbing \nYou might think that ice would be great to numb skin and reduce waxing pain . But applying anything cold to the skin tightens pores. It's the same principle as above, we want pores nice and relaxed. 7. Don't drink a lot of alcohol \nWhile having a couple glass of wine or beer before getting waxed sounds like a great idea, alcoholic drinks in the system can cause skin to be extra sensitive to waxing. Alcohol can dehydrate, creating water retention and making skin puffy. This puffiness might be the reason behind the extra discomfort. \nWax a couple hours after your last glass of alcohol. Drink water to hydrate your body and skin. 8. Don't think waxing at home will be easy \nIt looks pretty effortless when the techs work their magic. They put in on, put a strip over it and rip it off. In fact, it can be rather difficult to do on yourself, and will really hurt if you don't know what you're doing. Learn More: How to Wax 9. Don't tense up Some people hold their breath or tense their whole body while getting waxed. While it might be easier said than done, breathe deeply, a relaxed person will cope much better with the pain. 10. Don't wax where you shouldn't \nThe inside of ears and nose, eyelashes, nipples and male genitals shouldn't be waxed. Don't try waxing over sun-burned or irritated skin , warts, moles, cuts or pimples. Not only is it dangerous, but it could give you some mighty big pain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:44:09.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
