But, she added, “to some degree he’s right that the media is out to get him.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump’s attempts to demonize the mainstream media are nothing new. He has referred to the news media as the “opposition party” and repeatedly called legitimate news organizations “ fake news .” He and his aides have also consistently attacked the media’s credibility, calling out factual mistakes made by organizations sometimes even after corrections were made. But if the tactics were meant to convince the public that the media was a deceitful adversary, they did not appear to be having quite the desired effect. According to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday, 61 percent of respondents said they disapproved of the way Mr. Trump talked about the media. Fifty-two percent said they trusted the media more to tell the truth about important issues, while 37 percent said they trusted Mr. Trump more to do so. The political divide, however, is stark: Among Democrats, 86 percent said they trusted the media more to tell the truth, while 78 percent of Republicans said they trusted Mr. Trump more. A Fox News poll released last week showed respondents roughly evenly divided on whom they trusted more to tell the truth. “Nobody is perfect,” said Nick Lortie, 24, a plumber from Merrimack, N.H., who voted for the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, in the presidential election. “It’s like if the weatherman says it’s going to rain and it doesn’t — if someone tells them something and it turns out to be wrong, it’s not their fault,” he said, referring to the press. Charles Mellison Jr., 77, a retired long-haul truck driver and registered Democrat in Miami, said he thought Mr. Trump’s comments were intended to “throw people off.” “He should be more respectful,” he added, as he sipped a cup of coffee. “The media are not liars.” Rick Rutter, 56, a pastor and executive director of a local rescue mission from Nashua, N.H., chuckled at the idea that the media was the enemy of the American people. But he, like many others interviewed, said he did see a litany of problems with the press. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “It’s like that quote,” he said. “‘If you don’t read the paper, you’re uninformed. If you do, you’re misinformed.’” The news media, however, was acting like an enemy in at least one respect: It was exhausting him. During the run-up to the election, Mr. Rutter said, he had cut the cord in part because keeping up with different interpretations of current events on television had become fruitless.

(Half of the respondents to the Quinnipiac poll said they disapproved of the media’s coverage of Mr. Trump.) “I think it’s right and wrong,” Ted Friedman, 59, a part-time furniture upholsterer in Grand Rapids, said about likening the media to the enemy. “I think the media definitely is out there to stir the pot up and see what comes out of it.” But he added that his complaints were directed at national news outlets, not his local media. “I think what we’re seeing in the mainstream — we’re talking CNN, Fox and so forth — I think we’re seeing the kids are on the playground,” he said. “ Donald Trump ’s on the playground, the media’s on the playground, and they’re all fighting for that one little swing.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
