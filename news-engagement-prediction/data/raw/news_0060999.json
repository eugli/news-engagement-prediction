Huawei sub-brand Honor, for example, has just taken the covers off not one but two smartphones. The Honor 8 Lite, which was actually already revealed in Finland earlier this month, is now heading to China. The Honor V9, on the other hand, is a totally new and totally not mid-range smartphone that will hopefully also become available in other markets. \nAs the name so plainly points out, the Honor 8 Lite is a lighter version of the Honor 8 launched last year. It is, however, not a smaller version. On the outside, the two are nearly identical, with a 5.2-inch Full HD screen that hides a 3,000 mAh battery underneath. It has the same 12 megapixel camera on the back and 8 megapixel selfie shooter on the front. \nBeauty is skin deep, as they say, and it’s true for the Honor 8 Lite as well. Instead of the Honor 8’s powerful Kirin 955 processor, it only has a Kirin 655. Instead of 4 GB of RAM, it only goes with 3 GB. As for storage, it’s bordering on suffocating with only 16 GB of space inside. It at least does have a matching price tag of 1,099 CNY, roughly $160. \nHonor 8 lite specifications • Size: 147.2 x 72.9 x 7.6mm • Weight: 147g • Display: 5.2in 1080 x 1920 (Full HD) LCD • Operating System: Android 7.0 Nougat (EMUI 5.0) • Processor: HiSilicon Kirin 655 • Back Camera: 12MP, f/2.2 optics, Full HD video, LED flash • Front-facing camera: 8MP • Internal Storage: 32, 64GB – w/microSD card slot • Connectivity: WiFi 802.11 b/g/n/ac (2.4/5GHz), Bluetooth v4.2 • Other Features: Fingerprint scanner, microUSB 2.0, headphone jack \nPerhaps more interesting is the Honor V9 . Huawei’s sub-brand has mostly been painted as a mid-range and budget brand. The V9, however, turns that preconceived notion on its head. Everything about it screams premium, except perhaps for the design. \nThe Honor V9 is powered by a Kirin 960 processor, the latest from Huawei, with 4 or 6 GB of RAM, depending on the chosen configuration. Storage also depends on the configuration with choices of 32 GB with 4 GB RAM and 64 or 128 GB for the 6 GB option. The 5.7-inch LCD screen has a resolution of 2560×1440, a.k.a. QHD. \nHonor V9 specifications • Size: 157 x 77.5 x 6.97mm • Weight: 184g • Display: 5.7in WQHD 1440 x 2560 (2K) LCD • Operating System: Android 7.0 Nougat (EMUI 5.0) • Processor: HiSilicon Kirin 960 • Back Camera: Dual 12MP, f/2.2 optics, 4K video, dual-LED flash • Front-facing camera: 8MP with f/2.0 optics • Battery: 4,000mAh • Internal Storage: 64, 128GB – w/microSD card slot • Connectivity: WiFi 802.11 b/g/n/ac (2.4/5GHz), Bluetooth v4.2 LE • Other Features: Fingerprint scanner, USB-C, headphone jack \nThe Honor V9 boasts of a dual 12 meagpixel camera setup not unlike Huawei’s own flagships. Unsurprisingly, the Honor V9 seems to adopt the design of Apple’s dual camera model as well, though it apparently didn’t get the memo about the antenna lines. It at least still has a 3.5 mm headphone jack. \nWhile the Honor V9 does have a higher price tag of 2,999 CNY, roughly $435, for the 6 GB RAM + 64 GB storage configuration, it is still considerably lower than premium smartphones with similar specs. It remains to be seen if honor will bring this particular premium model to the US as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:45:09.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
