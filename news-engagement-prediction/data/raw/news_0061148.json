Credit Alex Brandon/Associated Press MESA, Ariz. — As Major League Baseball seeks to speed up games, one item on its wish list is expected to be in place this season after all. Managers can now signal from the dugout for an intentional walk without the pitcher needing to throw the pitches. The change, first reported by ESPN’s Howard Bryant, was confirmed by a baseball official who was not authorized to speak publicly until an official announcement was made. Commissioner Rob Manfred had expressed frustration Tuesday over the players’ union’s refusal to accept changes to quicken the pace of games, reminding reporters that he could unilaterally impose such changes in 2018. Baseball would still like to add a pitch clock, raise the strike zone and limit mound visits, and it views the intentional walk rule as mostly a symbolic gesture. Teams issued 932 intentional walks last season, or roughly one every two and a half games. While oddities have occurred during intentional walks — such as hits, wild pitches and the fake-intentional-walk-turned-strikeout in the 1972 World Series — the practice is generally considered tedious. “It’ll be a new normal in a relatively short period of time,” Chicago Cubs Manager Joe Maddon said. “Right now it’s going to elicit a lot of discussion, I get it. But to me that’s one of those things I wouldn’t really want to battle about, because I don’t think it’s that significant.” \n  Wade Davis, the Cubs’ closer, said he was fine with the change. “It’s like a decrease in athletic movement when you ask somebody to throw the ball slower to the catcher four times,” Davis said. “It’s not like an entertaining part when someone is throwing pitchouts — except when they throw it away, then it’s entertaining to some people.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:12:15.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
