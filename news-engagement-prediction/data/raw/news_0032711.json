The Orange County Register also lists all price increases since 2000 , when a Disneyland ticket cost just $41, or $57.14 in 2016 dollars according to the CPI inflation calculator . \nDiscounts are available for multiple-day admissions, but the company will now offer a $20 discount on such tickets purchased online or by phone in advance , the Orlando Sentinel said. \nThe prices of some annual passes at both resorts will also increase along with most parking fees. \nDisney’s earnings report last week showed lower net income and revenues , falling short of analysts’ expectations, Deadline reported. Year-over-year attendance in theme parks for the last quarter fell by 5 percent , the Orlando Sentinel said, in part because Hurricane Matthew closed the Florida parks for a day and a half in October. \nHowever, despite the lower attendance, revenue and income in the theme parks division increased, according to Forbes. \nMotley Fool analyst Rick Munarriz noted in his column that price increases in the parks may have helped to lower guest counts at the company’s famously crowded parks, with lower attendance in three of the past four quarters, while increasing revenue and profit. \n“ Disney will come out of this just fine ,” he predicted. “Disney is making more with less, and as long as revenue and operating income keep inching higher, don’t expect the media giant to ease back on the annual increases.” \nThe jump in prices comes just days after the company announced that “Pandora: The World Of Avatar,” the land at Disney’s Animal Kingdom in Florida, will open on May 27 . \nLands themed to “Star Wars” will open at Disneyland in Anaheim and Disney’s Hollywood Studios in Florida in 2019, the company said.
