I'm not dying this way.\"\nBremner, 36, says his family, including two young children, inspired him to fight for his life.\nThe shore was nine metres away, and he was wearing heavy snow pants, a heavy winter jacket and steel-toed boots.\n\"Weight wasn't a concern of mine. I was just in survival mode,\" he said.\nHe didn't know it at the time, but his shoulder was separated. He still managed to swim to shore.\nBremner's colleagues were travelling 20 kilometres behind him, so he knew he'd have to get up the bank fast to catch their attention, as they drove by.\nThey were the last trucks that would be travelling the road that night, so if he didn't get up in time, he would be stranded in –25 C weather, in his wet snow gear.\nLuckily, a colleague spotted him and stopped to help out. Bremner says it all over in about 35 minutes.\nRyan Bremner's truck was submerged under the lake. He says he pushed his head and chest out the window in order to get out before the cab filled with water. (Ryan Bremner)\nBremner was taken to the Valemount Hospital where doctors spent an hour warming him up and then sent him to the McBride Hospital by ambulance for further assessment.\nHis says his hands were red from frostbite. There were a few cuts on his head and his shoulder was separated.\nBremner says the experience has changed his life. Having worked in logging for over 10 years, he often forgets about the risks associated with the job.\n\"I just appreciate the little things a lot more,\" he said.\n\"I felt like Superman going through all of this, because I wasn’t going to give up,\" Bremner told CBC's Daybreak Kamloops.
