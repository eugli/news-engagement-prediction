The shirt in question featured an image of Negan's weirdly beloved baseball bat Lucille, alongside the words \"Eeny Meeny Miny Moe\" â€“ a callback to the scene in season six's finale where Negan jovially tries to decide which of Rick's group to kill.\nThough the modern version of this children's nursery rhyme continues with the phrase \"catch a tiger by his toe\", older versions contained the N-word instead of \"tiger\". The historical overtones led a shopper in Sheffield, UK to complain after he saw the shirt in a branch of the British retailer Primark.\nTwitter \"It was fantastically offensive,\" shopper Ian Lucraft told The Warwick Courier . \"I can only assume that no-one in the process of ordering it knew what they were doing or were aware of its subliminal messages. The slogan is 'Eeeny meenie miny moe...' It stops there, but of course we all know what the original said.\" Lucraft went on to say that the graphic image of a bloodied baseball bat \"is directly threatening of a racist assault, and if I were black and were faced by a wearer I would know just where I stood.\"", "external_links": ["http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/50/1600x1060/gallery-1481571257-twd-708-gp-0728-0116-rt.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/08/1487873646-the-walking-dead-primark-negan-tshirt.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/08/480x433/gallery-1487873646-the-walking-dead-primark-negan-tshirt.jpg", "http://www.warwickcourier.co.uk/news/primark-pulls-shocking-and-racist-walking-dead-t-shirt-from-stores-after-angry-complaint-1-7831402"], "published": "2017-02-24T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:34:35.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
