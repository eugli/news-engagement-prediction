Image copyright Getty Images Legally recognised union between a same-sex couple Equal legal treatment in matters including inheritance and next-of-kin arrangements Partnership can be conducted in private, whereas marriage ceremonies must be public and can be conducted by clergy Failed partnerships require a legal dissolution, like divorce Political, religious and social considerations influenced choice of the term \"civil partnership\" Most campaigners accepted the title because they had secured the underlying rights \nThe Court of Appeal agreed the couple had established a potential violation of Article 14 of the European Convention, which relates to discrimination, taken with Article 8, which refers to respect for private and family life. \nBut, by a majority, the judges said it was at present justified by the government's policy of \"wait and evaluate\". \nThe secretary of state for education, who has responsibility for equalities within government, said it was decided, after public consultations and debate in Parliament, not to extend civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples, abolish them or phase them out. \nThe aim was to see how extending marriage to same-sex couples impacted on civil partnerships before making a final decision which, if reversed in a few years' time, would be disruptive, unnecessary and extremely expensive. 'Equality and choice' Image copyright Kate Stewart \nKate Stewart and Matthew Cole, 46, decided to get a civil partnership in Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory, in June 2016, after deciding marriage was not for them. \n\"It just felt to be a more appropriate way to formalise the recognition of our relationship,\" said Dr Stewart, from Derby. \n\"I have been married before... but Matthew and I didn't feel that marriage reflected our relationship. \n\"The institution [of marriage] is very much unequal depending on your religion. \n\"We therefore felt it wasn't a status we were comfortable with because it still had hangovers of inequality from the past.\" \nDr Stewart, 48, said although they believe marriage is right for some couples, it was about having the choice. \nThey wanted recognition of their relationship after 10 years together. \nBut their civil partnership is not legally recognised in the UK. \n\"We paid for ceremony in pounds, we have a certificate, it was all very British, but as soon as we were back home we didn't have legal recognition,\" Dr Stewart said. \n\"The declaration that we were both each other's partner was quite moving... we were on an equal footing. It was surprisingly touching.\" \nWhy choose civil partnership over marriage? \nMs Steinfeld and Mr Keidan, who live in Hammersmith, west London, originally applied for notice to form a civil partnership in 2014, but were turned away by the registrars. \nIn the same year, the Same Sex Couples Marriage Act extended the right to marry to gay couples in England and Wales, who can now choose between civil partnership and marriage. The couple contend that the same choice should be available to all couples. \nThey then took their case to the High Court, but the judge ruled that the ban on mixed-sex civil partnerships was not unlawful. \nWhat do you want to know about civil partnership and marriage?
