refused to go to hospital for fear of being recognised before prison death Mariusz Krezolek, 36, and partner Magdelena Luczak were convicted of murdering four-year-old Daniel in 2012   Share   Comments By Alexander Britton 04:56, 11 FEB 2017 News Daniel Pelka was starved and murdered by his mum and stepdad (Photo: Daily Mirror)     daily   The stepfather of murdered schoolboy Daniel Pelka refused to go to hospital for fear of being recognised before he died in prison.\nMariusz Krezolek, 36, and partner Magdelena Luczak, were convicted of one of the country's worst child cruelty cases after four-year-old Daniel was starved and beaten.\nDaniel weighed just 1st 9lbs when he died aged four in March 2012 in Coventry.\nKrezolek and Luczak were sentenced to at least 30 years in jail for murder and both have since died in custody.\nMariusz Krezolek A report into Krezolek's death at HMP Full Sutton, near Pocklington, Yorkshire, in January 2016 reveals he was suffering painful medical complaints but refused treatment.\nRead More Heavily pregnant woman caught on camera battering her dog walks free after saying she was protecting unborn baby Nigel Newcomen, Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, wrote: \"Mr Krezolek had been treated for a fistula in prison and inflammatory bowel disease but refused to go to hospital for treatment, as he said he was afraid he would be recognised.\"\nMagdelena Luczak mother of Daniel Pelka \"He continued to refuse to be referred to hospital for treatment or to be admitted to the prison's inpatient unit.\n\"He told healthcare staff that he was afraid he would be recognised if he went to hospital.\n\"His offence had attracted a high degree of media interest.\"\nKrezolek rang his cell bell and complained of chest pains at around 3am of January 27, with a nurse suggesting he travel to the prison's healthcare centre for an electrocardiogram which he refused.\nThe report said: \"The nurse wanted to take Mr Krezolek to the healthcare centre for an ECG to rule out heart problems but Mr Krezolek refused to go and said he would see the doctor the next morning.\"\nStained mattress Daniel Pelka was forced to sleep on during his confinement in the box room (Photo: PA) Daniel Pelka's bedroom door with the handle taken off (Photo: Jon Fuller-Rowell) When officers began unlocking cells around five hours later, he was found unresponsive.\nStaff began resuscitation attempts and an ambulance was called, but Krezolek was confirmed dead just before 9am, with a post-mortem confirming the cause of death as a heart attack.\nThe report by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman also reveals Krezolek twice attempted suicide after his partner hanged herself at HMP Foston Hall, Derbyshire, in July 2015.\nDaniel Pelka 2D front image of bruising (Photo: Jon Fuller-Rowell) It said: \"In September he told a consultant psychiatrist that he had tried to hang himself twice in the previous fortnight.\n\"He was moved to the inpatient unit and prescribed an antidepressant.\"\nAn inquest at Hull Coroners' Court concluded Krezolek died of natural causes.\nDuring his final months, Daniel Pelka was denied food, forced to perform punishment exercises, confined in a locked box room, poisoned with salt, and subjected to water torture.\nA judge at Birmingham Crown Court said \"unimaginable acts of cruelty and brutality\" were inflicted on the child.\nLuczak's trial heard Daniel was regularly \"imprisoned\" for prolonged periods of time in a small, unheated room at his home.\nThe door to the box room had been adapted by Krezolek so Daniel could not escape or even see out of the keyhole.\nPassing sentence in 2013, Mrs Justice Cox said: \"It is a particularly grave aggravating feature in this case that, before the fatal blows to his head, Daniel was the victim of chronic and systematic starvation.\"\nThe medical evidence, the judge said, showed Daniel's emaciation was regarded by experts as \"unprecedented\" in Britain.\nThe trial also heard Luczak, despite knowing of Daniel's hunger, gave specific instructions to his teachers that he was not to eat any more food than his small packed lunch because of an eating disorder.\n  Daily Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Daily   Daniel Pelka Prisons Crime", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled":
