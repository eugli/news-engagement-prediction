A still from a 2017 Audi ad that ran during the Super Bowl. (Photo: Audi) \nOne of the most talked-about Super Bowl ads this year came from Audi, which touted its commitment to equal pay in a 60-second spot about a man and his daughter. \nThe ad features the dad watching his daughter in a cart race as she passes competitor after competitor, all of them boys, before finishing in first place. \n“Do I tell her that despite her education, her drive, her skills, her intelligence, she will automatically be valued as less than every man she ever meets?” the father says in a voiceover. \"Or maybe I'll be able to tell her something different.\" \nThe ad cuts to black, and white text appears: “Audi of America is committed to equal pay for equal work. Progress is for everyone.” \nIt was one in a series of Super Bowl LI ads touching on progressive causes. Airbnb aired an ad promoting acceptance of people “ no matter … where you come from ,” while Budweiser and hardware chain 84 Lumber told stories of immigrants seeking hope of a new life in America. \nAll of those ads generated both praise and criticism on Sunday, and Audi’s ad was no different. \nSome, including Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer, praised the ad. We see you #Audi great commercial — octavia spencer (@octaviaspencer) February 6, 2017 Aaaah this Audi USA commercial on equal pay is every single freaking excellent thing in the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:40:45.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
