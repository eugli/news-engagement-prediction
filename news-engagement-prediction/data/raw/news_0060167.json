Community members gather Wednesday to help repair Kim's Country Cafe, which was damaged by floodwaters over the weekend. (Joseph Serna / Los Angeles Times) Joseph Serna , including the home of Troughton's daughter, residents of this Northern California community of just over 1,100 weren’t about to let her throw in the towel. \n\"Everyone knows everyone here, and if they don't, they do after something like this,\" said Sarah Hendrix, Troughton's daughter. \nEven though her home was surrounded by water, firefighters used a truck to pick up Troughton and take her to her restaurant and then helped her salvage what food they could find. The building was a mess however, and the necessary repairs were overwhelming, Troughton said. \nBut then an area contractor nicknamed Fuzzy reassured her. \n“Kim, we got this,” Troughton recalled him saying, her voice choked up with emotion. “We got this.” \nThe community helped her launch a GoFundMe account to help with expenses. By Thursday, it was almost halfway toward its goal of $9,000. \n\"You always know there's a good feeling here, but when something like this happens and the people that stepped up to help me reopen — because they wouldn't let it close — it's so humbling,\" Troughton said. \nWhen an eager television reporter visited the diner earlier this week to report on the floods, Troughton said she set ground rules. \n\"I said 'I don't want your cameras in here, I don't want your microphone in here.' This is sanctuary for my guys,\" she said, referring to her regular customers. \nTroughton has lived in Maxwell for 23 years and has operated the brick-red building on Old Highway 99 as Kim's Country Cafe for the last five. But like virtually everything else in this tiny agricultural community about an hour's drive north from of Sacramento, the location is steeped in history. \n\"I don't remember a day that went by that my grandpa … didn't stop into the Cafe,\" Colleen Johnson wrote on the cafe's donation page. \"It may have changed names over the years, but it is a part of my childhood and a part of Maxwell. Our prayers are with you.\" Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss \nPresident Trump has withdrawn protections for transgender students .
