The show started off with a model revving up a luxury sportscar and ended with the actor mesmerising the whole crowd with his walk. Dressed in a white embroidered outfit, Varun looked dapper As ever. As he walked the ramp, people couldn’t take their eyes of him. Sonakshi Sinha, Mohit Marwah, Prateik Babbar and Arjun Kapoor were seen cheering him on as his walk in the parking lot of the venue. \nTalking about Kunal’s collection, he chose light colours like blues, yellows and whites for this summer. We did see his traditional purples and blacks too, but he focused more on the whites this time around. As always his outfits had a lot of prints and embroidery work. We even saw a lot of new shoe designs and accessories during his show. Kunal’s shows always have a theme and this time it was The Race of Separates, which is luxury wear which can be worn on every occasion. He focused a lot on the set design too and this helped enhance the whole show.
