If convicted, Snowden’s crimes would lead to a minimum of 30 years in prison. The death penalty is also on the table in certain circumstances. \nSnowden’s lawyer, Ben Wizner, told NBC News he was unaware of any such plans. “Team Snowden has received no such signals and has no new reason for concern,” according to Wizner. \nAs for Snowden, he took the opportunity to point out the planned extradition, if true, offers “irrefutable proof” that he didn’t cooperate with Russian intelligence. Finally: irrefutable evidence that I never cooperated with Russian Intel.

Former deputy national security advisor Juan Zarate cautioned the current administration about taking the “gift” from Russian President Vladimir Putin: \nFor Russia, this would be a win-win. They’ve already extracted what they needed from Edward Snowden in terms of information and they’ve certainly used him to beat the United States over the head in terms of its surveillance and cyber activity. \nIt would signal warmer relations and some desire for greater cooperation with the new administration, but it would also no doubt stoke controversies and cases in the U.S. around the role of surveillance, the role of the U.S. intelligence community, and the future of privacy and civil liberties in an American context. \nAll of that would perhaps be music to the ears of Putin. \nRussian spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, for what it’s worth, says the report is “nonsense.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:08:00.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
