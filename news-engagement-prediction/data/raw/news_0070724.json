Advertisement \nThe Christian Brothers have spent $1.53 million on defending one of Australia's worst paedophiles, Robert Charles Best , who pleaded guilty in the County Court of Victoria on Monday to the sexual abuse of 20 children. \nData released by the royal commission shows 301 Christian Brothers, who ministered between 1950 and 2010, were alleged to have molested children. \nThe order has paid $48.5 million to 763 claimants between 1980 and 2015. \n\"I'm appalled, shamed, humbled,\" Brother Carroll said of the findings. \"I deeply regret it and it challenges our brothers to the core.\" \nThe 12th day of the inquiry heard evidence from the leaders of seven Catholic orders, five of which had the highest proportion of alleged perpetrators. \nAccording to the royal commission's analysis, the highest proportion of alleged offenders were in the St John of God Brothers (40pc), followed by the Christian Brothers (22pc), the Salesians of Don Bosco (21.9pc), the Marist Brothers (20.4pc) and the De La Salle Brothers (13.8pc). \nMarist Brothers schools, including St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill, Parramatta Marist High, Marist College Canberra and Marist Brothers Hamilton, were among the institutions with the highest number of claims, according to the report. \nBrother Peter Carroll, Marist Brothers Australian provincial, told the hearing he was unsure why those institutions had attracted clusters of perpetrators. \n\"(It) could have been the whole lack of voice given to young people, so that complaints were not brought forward by them. They weren't believed in some cases,\" he said. \"There could have been a very rigid control mechanism that was part of the culture of those schools.\" \nThe Marist Brothers paid $31 million to 286 child sexual abuse claimants between 1980 and 2015. \nBrother Carroll told the hearing the Marist Brothers also pay legal fees for accused brothers on a case by case basis. \nEach of the orders indicated they would co-operate with the Federal government's multi-billion dollar redress scheme to begin next year. \nThe hearing, before Justice Peter McClellanâ€‹, continues. \nBlue Knot Helpline 1300 657 380.
