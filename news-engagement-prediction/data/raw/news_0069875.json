And, to be honest, they haven't had to be very good at the game whatsoever. \nOver recent years, FIFA videos have dominated the internet and, despite it seeming like there is only so much entertainment football fans can get from watching someone else play a video game, the interest and demand for such content are showing no signs of slowing.

BT Sport reach landmark agreement \nAs per the Guardian , BT Sport will, for the first time, broadcast live FIFA 17 matches after winning the rights to broadcast the four remaining EA FIFA Majors in this year’s Ultimate Team Championship Series. \nThe events will see the world's best FIFA 17 gamers go head-to-head, competing on both Xbox One and PlayStation 4, to reach the FIFA 17 Ultimate Team Championship Final in Berlin, which will take place on the weekend of the 21st/22nd May. \nBT Sport subscribers will be able to enjoy virtual football on their TV screens from April 8, when the North American regional final in Vancouver takes place, before the Asia-Pacific regional final in Singapore on the 22nd and followed by European regional finals in Madrid. Huge financial reward at stake \nThe winner of the event will net an eye-watering sum nearing £130,000 by proving himself to be the best FIFA gamer on the planet, while the runner-up will take away £65,000. \nThe deal with BT Sport marks a big advancement in the world of e-sports, but the channel's viewers are not entirely convinced by the prospect of gamers playing FIFA being on their TV screens. \nHowever, there is clearly an audience for e-sports, after Sky Sports broadcast the FIFA Interactive World Cup final back in October last year. \n“This is yet another example of live innovation from BT Sport. Competitive interactive football gaming is a rapidly growing industry and I’m delighted that BT Sport is now able to showcase it for the first time ever in the UK.” said Simon Green, head of BT Sport. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
