(Dixie D. Vereen/For The Washington Post)\nA respectable crab cake sandwich is served on a sesame seed bun. (Dixie D. Vereen/For The Washington Post) Gentrification saw the demise three months ago of Louis’ Restaurant & Carry Out in Ivy City , a genial corner retreat where you could get a sandwich for less than five bucks. Helping to fill the gap in the neighborhood, for breakfast if not for bargain-basement prices, is Ari’s Diner, which made its debut in December. Anyone looking for a stack of fluffy buttermilk pancakes or steak and eggs should get to the Hecht Warehouse development off busy New York Avenue NE.\n[Got dining questions?

What’s not aluminum trim or tiny floor tiles at Ari’s is green upholstery or other accent. “Green is the color of freedom,” says Gejdenson, a welcome shade “in these trying times.” He found retro images of buses, cars and trucks in a book and laminated the counter with them. The whimsical designs are meant to “embrace the traffic” entering Washington from nearby.\nThe diner’s single-page, all-day menu includes a handful of omelets, Belgian waffles, Greek salad and six sandwiches. From the griddle come respectable hamburgers and crab cakes, slipped into sesame-seed buns and offered with a choice of skinny, hand-cut french fries or greens tossed with a lemony dressing. In a nod to contemporary tastes, there’s also avocado toast — cold when I sampled it — glossed with olive oil and perked up with pickled onions. Drinks include milkshakes (classic or boozy), Compass coffee, DC Brau and a modest sparkling wine — something for every mood, more or less.\nOmelets are served all day. (Dixie D. Vereen/For The Washington Post) A lighter hand with the oil would improve the diced potatoes, and the line cooks seem averse to salt. My omelet stuffed with spinach, tomato and feta cheese needed a few shakes of hot sauce to wake it up. But those are easy fixes, and there’s plenty else to like. Make room for the tender house-baked biscuits, sandwiched with peppery sausage gravy and flanked with sunny scrambled eggs.\nWatching over the tidy kitchen is Matt Heimbauer, a chef with the restaurant group, which recently added a Mexican outpost next door, the colorful La Puerta Verde.\nAri’s is not the restaurateur’s first diner. That would be The Diner in Florence, Italy, where, as a soccer player in 2003, Gejdenson opened a five-booth American eatery in a 900-year-old building with vaulted ceilings. His primary audience: expats, students and tourists.\nGejdenson can’t complain about the commute to his new restaurants. His home, after all, is on the east side of the same building.\n2003 Fenwick St. NE., 202-290-1827, arisdiner.com.
