Mikey East 16 February 2017 • 10:32am \nK im Jong-nam’s death has astonished the world. The 45-year-old brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un was about to board a flight to Macau, where he lives in exile, when he was assassinated at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. \nHis murder has made international headlines - particularly because of the circumstances behind it. \nKim is said to have been assassinated by poison, reportedly the deadly toxin ricin. It was most famously used to kill Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov, who had a ricin-filled pellet fired into the back of his thigh on London's Waterloo Bridge in 1978. He died four days later, when the poison stopped the normal growth and repair process in his cells. \nAlready two women have been arrested in connection with Kim Jong-nam's death - Doan Thi Huong, travelling on a Vietnamese passport, and Siti Aishah, travelling on an Indonesian passport. Kim Jong-nam and an image of his alleged assassin caught on CCTV \n\"One of the girls was told to hold a handkerchief on the face of the victim after he'd been sprayed by the other girl,\" an unnamed senior police officer told The Telegraph. \"She held it there for 10 seconds. She said she thought spraying him had been a 'prank'.\" \nT he reports have fuelled suspicion that Kim was killed by two female secret agents. As yet these claims are unfounded, but if true, it would not be the first time that female spies have made global news for their crimes. \nHere are six female assassins, whose actions have resulted in death, terrorism and mass murder. 1. Shi Jianqiao Shi Jianqiao as a young woman \nW hen Chinese military officer Shi Congbin was murdered by Zhili warlord Sun Chuanfang in 1925, his daughter Shi Jianqiao took it upon herself to avenge him. Her father had not just been murdered by Sun but decapitated, with his severed head displayed on a pike at a local train station. \nIn retaliation, Shi tracked down Sun and assassinated him with three shots from her pistol. Instead of fleeing the scene, she stayed to justify her actions to passers-by, offering them leaflets to explain what she had done. \nIn the end, the moral edge to her crime meant that she was granted a full pardon in 1936 for “filial piety.” 2.

Credit: FRANCOIS MORI/AP \nM argaretha MacLeod made her name as an exotic dancer, performing the 'dance of the seven veils' across Europe. Yet today she is known to most as Mata Hari, the “greatest woman spy of the 20th century”; accused of delivering allied military secrets into the hands of the Germans and directly causing the deaths of up to 50,000 French soldiers. \nShe was first employed by German intelligence in 1914, due to her high-ranking lovers, and her ability to travel freely through Europe as a Dutch national. After being rumbled by the British as a spy, was eventually executed by the French in 1917, aged 41, after being convicted of passing military secrets to the Germans. It is rumoured she flung open her coat to reveal her naked body to distract the firing squad. 3. La Tigresa Idoia Lopez Riano, nicknamed La Tigresa – the tigress, killed 23 people Credit: EFE \nI doia Lopez Riano, nicknamed La Tigresa for her legendary sexual prowess, was one of the leading commandos in the violent campaign for Basque independence from Spain in the 1980s. \nShe was responsible for a bomb that killed 12 Civil Guards in 1986, and another that caused the deaths of five more, later that year. She is also alleged to have seduced policemen before shooting their colleagues and quickly became one of the most wanted terrorists of Basque nationalist separatist group, the ETA. In 2003, she was sentenced to more than 1,500 years in prison for her crimes and in 2011 was kicked out of the ETA after apologising for her actions . 4. Marie Sukloff Governor General Fyodor Dubasov was killed by Marie Sukloff \nM arie Sukloff was a young peasant in early 20th century Russia, at a time when the Governor General Fyodor Dubasov was murdering and targeting Jews. Sukloff joined forces with a local group and one night in 1914, set out to murder Dubasov. \nHer comrade threw a bomb under the Governor’s carriage, but when it fell in the snow and failed to explode, Sukloff bravely picked it up and threw it through the window. The Governor was murdered, while Sukloff was left “on the road amid a heap of debris.” She survived, and was later imprisoned for his murder. 5. Kim Hyun-hui Kim Hyun-hui \nK im Hyun-hui is a 55-year-old mother of two and mass murderer . At the age of 19, she claims to have been recruited from university in Pyongyang to become a North Korean agent. She trained for six years, learning to speak and act like a Japanese person, until 1987 when South Korea was preparing to host the Olympic games in Seoul. \nNorth Korea’s Kim II-sung and his son Kim Jong-il were determined to prevent the games taking place, so Hyun-hui was ordered to take down a South Korean airliner. She placed a bomb in the overhead compartments of flight 858, before disembarking the plane herself during a stop over. The bomb detonated killing all 115 on board. \nHyun-hui was captured, and confessed. She was sentenced to death in 1989, but President Roe Tae-Woo pardoned her. She is now married to a former South Korean intelligence officer, has two children and after defecting, now lives in fear of revenge from Pyongyang. 6. Charlotte Corday Charlotte Corday by Jean-Jacques Hauer; and a section of Jacques-Louis David’s painting 'The Death of Marat' (1793) \nI n 1793, during France’s Reign of Terror, a young aristocrat called Charlotte Corday took it upon herself to assassinate influential journalist Jean-Paul Marat . She believed his newspaper, L'ami du Peuple ,was responsible for the September Massacres, where 1200 and 1400 prisoners were murdered in a brutal bloodbath. \nTo avoid the escalation of an all-out civil war, she set out to murder Marat. In a well-planned attack, she wrote an “Address to the French people, friends of Law and Peace”, explaining her motives, before travelling to Paris with a large knife. \nShe gained access to Marat under the pretenses of telling him about a planned uprising. As he wrote down the false information, she pulled out her knife and stabbed him in the chest. Four days after the murder, Corday was executed by guillotine, and Marat was, in spite of her best efforts, immortalised into a martyr by the Jacobins. 7. Brigitte Mohnhaupt Brigitte Mohnhaupt \nI n the Sixties and Seventies, Brigitte Mohnhaupt was a member of West German communist terrorist group the Red Army Faction (RAF), which attacked Germans for decades, and killed at least 30 people. Monhnhaupt, a long-term member of the militant organisation, was involved in the assassinations of leading German figures including industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer; Dresdner Bank head Juergen Ponto; and federal prosecutor Siegfried Buback. \nIn 1985, the assassin once described as “the most evil and dangerous woman in West Germany\" was sentenced to life in jail for crimes she expressed “no remorse” for . Yet 24 years later, to much controversy, she was freed on probation.
