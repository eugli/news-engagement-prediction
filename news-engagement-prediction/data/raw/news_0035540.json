Difficult to run two herds says cattleman \nAndy Hayes said it was the first change they had made in the herd in a long time. \n\"Predominately, when we came out here 22 years ago, it was all a Shorthorn herd that we changed over to a Droughtmaster herd,\" he said. \n\"Seventeen years ago there was a time that was hard to sell Hereford [female] cattle off of Undoolya, so I sold a lot of my Droughtmaster females and replaced them with Undoolya heifers. \n\"Since then, we've been having two herds â€” Droughtmaster herd in the hill country where it's really rough, and the Herefords out on the outside country where it's a bit more open. \n\"It's hard running two herds [because] you're always getting a lot crossbred females and males. \n\"Crossbred steers are unbelievable, meat buyers love them, but with the [crossbred] Hereford females we were battling to move them. \n\"No-one wants crossbred females, even though if you take their coats off it's the same meat underneath.\" Photo: The entry to The Garden Station, Alice Springs. (ABC Rural: Nathan Coates ) \nMr Hayes said it was a decision the family made together before Christmas. \n\"We were lucky enough at the time that the Williams family down in northern South Australia just purchased Anna Creek and they were looking for Hereford females,\" he said. \nThe heifers have already started to settle in at The Garden after arriving last week. Trucking in cattle during wet \nWith recent rains in Central Australia, Mr Hayes said there were some issues getting the cattle out. \n\"The Herefords were supposed to have gone in the middle of January, but that didn't happen obviously [because] we had too much rain, which was lovely,\" he said. \nGetting the cattle in was also logistically challenging.

I had to do a bit of chasing around and ring up an old mate who's got a grader in Alice and he came and tidied our road up,\" Mr Hayes said. \n\"It was just in time. The grader was going past the house as the truck was coming into the house.\" \nMr Hayes said it was great timing as he had never seen feed on the ground this thick before. \n\"It's scary to walk around or even ride a motorbike through it, you don't know what's underneath there,\" he said. \n\"It's definitely bloody good, it's beautiful. Hopefully we've got enough heifers to eat all the feed.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T15:42:13.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
