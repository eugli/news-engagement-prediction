His bail has been set at $10,000.   \nThe incident occurred on the evening of Feb. 15, and was recorded by Melissa Torrez on her cellphone. In the video, the dog is seen lying on its side, being dragged by the neck. \n\"I turn around. I see him dragging his dog from the middle of street all the way to second driveway,\" Torrez explained. \"I'm out of my car yelling at him, asking him, 'What are you doing? What's wrong with you?' And he just keeps going telling me to mind my own business, it's his dog he can do whatever he wants.\"   \nTorrez said the man dragged the German shepherd behind him for about two blocks, according to Lt. Jody Tittle of the Mission Police Department, which reportedly received hundreds of calls from concerned residents. \nTittle said animal cruelty is considered a crime \"if the person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, transports an animal in a cruel manner.
