Panhandlers and others often congregate near the area, and a handful have been hit in the past three years. \nOn Friday morning, Rice University professor Marjorie Corcoran died after she was struck by a Metro light rail train at the Hermann Park rail stop. \n\nLatest from the Chron.com Homepage Click below for the top news from around the Houston area and beyond.
