And I know I’m not alone. Full time working parents are busy. Not just ‘I have three different mates to catch up with this Saturday’, but chronically, persistently busy. \nAccording to the ABS, only 10 per cent of families with young kids in Australia have two full time working parents. \nAnd there’s a reason for that. It’s bloody tough; nearly impossible to manage life outside of work if you’re both expected in the office 40 hours a week. \nNot only are there daycare pick-ups and drop offs to manage (if you are lucky enough your working hours fall within the opening hours of a daycare centre), but every day life to stay on top of. \nOf course, people without children, or those with older kids also have to keep their ‘life maintenance’ in check. But for those with young kids, the sheer number of appointments you’re often asked to attend is overwhelming. \nThere’s doctor’s appointments (weekly in our case — my two kids they seem to pick up a lot bugs), other specialists, and random things like getting involved in ‘outings’ for the three-year-old’s daycare centre. \nYesterday was a fairly typical, manic day. But it got me thinking — why aren’t we looking closely at more financial support for alternate forms of childcare? The care at our children’s daycare centres is fantastic. But, like Sarah Hansen (right), we would consider a nanny if it wasn’t prohibitive. Picture: Darren England Source: News Limited \nIf we had the means, we would look at hiring a nanny. But to get someone qualified, and ask them to do more than just childcare, and actually help manage our lives, would cost around $70,000 a year (more if I needed them to work more than eight hours a day). If your nanny is registered, and you earn less than $180,000 as a family you can get help in the form of around $35 per child per week . For two kids that means my $70,000 nanny bill would be cut to $66,460. That’s prohibitive for most families. \nRight now we pay around $35,000 a year after childcare rebates (which at the moment are capped at $15,000 for our two kids). It’s not easy, but we scrape together the money. Without the rebate one of us would have to stay home (at least part time). \nHaving a nanny would take away a lot of the stress from our lives. We wouldn’t be forced to find last minute care (or take a day off) each time one of our kids was too sick to go to daycare. We could ask the nanny to open the door to a tradie if something in the house was busted. But the cost for employing someone is so prohibitive, we could never consider it. So instead, we continue The Juggle. \nTHE DAILY REALITY OF ‘THE JUGGLE’ \nFor me, ‘The Juggle’ means literally running out the door of work at the end of my shift so I can fit everything in. \nYesterday my ‘Juggle’ went like this (bear in mind I work breakfast shift, so finish at 2:30pm). \nRan out of work to make the early train. Ran home. Had a 20 second handover from my mother-in-law who had been looking after my sick baby (we were both running late). Put the baby in the car, drove to the mechanic to get the car serviced. Left the car there, and power-walked to the GP just in time for our appointment. Went to the chemist to get meds. Went to the supermarket for supplies. Picked up the three-year-old from daycare. Got home and stuck a ‘wee collection bag’ on the baby and sat right behind her while waiting for her to do her business. After 10 minutes the grocery delivery arrived, so I left the baby to crawl around. Of course that’s when she went. So I cleaned up her mess, managed to salvage some wee, and put it in the sample jar. Somehow got some dinner into the kids, then bathed them and got them to bed. \nMy husband rushed home to make sure he’d be able to take the sample before the medical practice closed at 8pm. I cleaned the house. We both collapsed on the couch around 8:15pm. \nI feel like I’m acting out the script of some manic comedy. Except there’s no laugh track. I just have to laugh at myself. \nOf course I know that plenty of people without kids have lots to do outside of work hours. But the reality is with kids these errands multiply. For example, I have a weekly appointment with a speech pathologist for my son — something that can’t be done on a weekend. \nI’m incredibly lucky my husband and I have staggered work hours, meaning he can drop the kids at daycare while I’m working, and I’ll do the pick up / running around in the afternoon. Not all families have that, and it makes full time work for both parties almost impossible. \nIf the government was serious about supporting working families, they would look at the reality of our lives, and actually find practical ways to support us. Help with flexible childcare would be a start.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:28:24.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
