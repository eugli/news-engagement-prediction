Restaurant Brands did not respond immediately to a request for comment, while Popeyes decline to comment.\nPopeyes, whose fans include pop singer Beyoncé, began 45 years ago as a Southern-fried \"Chicken on the Run\" restaurant in a New Orleans suburb. It has since expanded to more than 2,000 restaurants, of which 1,600 are in the United States.\nThe company has benefited from strong customer loyalty, as well as from a restaurant refurbishment program.\nChicken accounts for about 10 per cent of the fast-food industry, according to data service IBISWorld, and Popeyes' market share is growing. The largest brands in the sector include privately held Chick-fil-A and Yum! Brands Inc's KFC.\nTim Hortons owner in bid to buy Popeyes: report Private equity firm 3G Capital, which is controlled by Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, owns about 43 per cent of the voting shares in Restaurant Brands. 3G Capital has made a name by acquiring major U.S. consumer companies including Kraft Heinz.\nRestaurant Brands was formed in 2014, when 3G Capital-backed Burger King acquired Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons Inc for $11 billion.\n3G Capital's long-time partner, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, committed $3 billion of preferred equity to finance that deal.\n© Thomson Reuters, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:11:31.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
