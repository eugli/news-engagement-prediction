Photo: Chris Ratcliffe \nMr Koutsantonis told Radio National on Thursday the state had sufficient electricity capacity available, with about 250 MW of the Pelican Point gas-fired power station unused. \n\"Every South Australian has every right to be furious with the way our national electricity market is operating,\" Mr Koutsantonis told RN. \n\"We're at the mercy now of national operators in a privatised market that operate on price signals rather than a public good.\" \nThe largest owner of Pelican Point, French multinational electric utility company Engie, said half of the 490 MW power plant had been operating since last June. \nThe other unit, though, had not been in service because \"it hasn't been viable to operate\", a spokesman told Fairfax Media. 'Crisis' \nFederal Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said the latest power failure followed a series of similar events, including last September's total outage across the state after a freak storm. \nThis time there was no tempest, but wind energy supplied just 2.5 per cent of the electricity in the state, underscoring the lack of reliability in South Australia's power sector, he said. \n\"[Premier] Jay Weatherill has a crisis here,\" Mr Frydenberg told Sky News on Thursday, adding there would be a full inquiry into Wednesday's outages. \nMr Frydenberg said the Labor-run states had \"run ahead\" of the market in setting renewable energy targets beyond the 2020 goal set at the Commonwealth level. \nThat target is for annual renewable energy sources to provide 33,000 gigawatt-hours per per by 2020, amounting to an expected share of about 23 per cent of Australia's electricity market by then. \nSouth Australia draws about 40 per cent of its power from renewable energy, mostly wind farms. It also has a power link to Victoria through which it can export or import supplies. \nQueensland has set a target of supplying 50 per cent of power from clean energy sources by 2030, a goal that federal Labor leader Bill Shorten endorses nationally. The Victorian goal is for 40 per cent by 2025. 'Retaking control' \nMr Koutsantonis said Wednesday's cuts were unnecessary and the state would be announcing steps it would take to avoid a repeat of the rolling blackouts. \n\"The Premier and I have come to the conclusion now that the South Australian people expect us to retake control of own destiny,\" he told RN. \n\"We are going to be intervening in the market from this day forward. We're not going to allow market forces and people who use electricity markets for profiteering to set our own future.\" \nFairfax Media has sought comment from AEMO about whether it could have avoided the blackouts, and whether there would be any steps as the mercury soars again on Thursday. \nAt a media conference on Thursday, Mr Weatherill said it was \"galling to me to think there was sufficient thermal capacity in the system and it wasn't used\". \nMr Koutsantonis said AEMO had been operating the industry \"like a stockmarket\" but neither he nor Mr Weatherill detailed what steps they planned to take.
