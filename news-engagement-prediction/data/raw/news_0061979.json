Klimek, for USA TODAY) \nSAN FRANCISCO â€” Marc Andreessen, who coined the term \"Tweetstorm\" and helped popularize it, is back on Twitter after a five-month absence. \n\"Ask me anything! $20 per answer. All $ goes to @BlackGirlsCode . Send your questions here,\" the influential venture capitalist said in a tweet today. Ask me anything! $20 per answer. All $ goes to @BlackGirlsCode . Send your questions here: https://t.co/IKp1WAsN4u ðŸ˜€ â€” Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) February 23, 2017 \nWith that 140-character message, Andreessen ended a months-long silence that was signified with a \"Taking a Twitter break!\" post on Sept. 25, 2016. At the time, he gave no reason for the hiatus and deleted all his tweets. \nThe Internet pioneer-turned-co-founder of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, who has more than 600,000 followers, gave no indication why he returned to the micro-blogging site. In late September, he told a Silicon Valley audience he felt \"free as a bird\" and \"50 pounds lighter\" after taking time off from Twitter. \nAndreessen's frequent tweets on technology and economics sometimes landed him in hot water. A year ago, he apologized for tweet claiming India's stance against colonialism has hurt the country economically. The tweet, which Facebook board member Andreessen made as a defense of the social network's Free Basics Internet service, resulted in a rare rebuke from Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.
