DWFritz has been in growth mode for several years, ramping up from 77 U.S. employees at the end of 2013 to 213 now. It has also added about 200 workers in China in that time. The company does all its design, engineering and assembly work in Wilsonville. Its workforce in China installs and supports the sophisticated tools the company makes. Last year, the company expanded its Wilsonville headquarters to make room for the growth. Pete Danko covers energy, manufacturing and ports.
