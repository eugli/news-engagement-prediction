The incident and its aftermath triggered a long-running and sometimes confusing case that underscores the challenges colleges and universities face in dealing with ambiguous sexual assault allegations outside the legal system. \nLater that night, Nathan tried to resume the encounter -- reaching underneath Melanie’s shirt -- but he said he stopped after she rejected him. Sixteen months later, Melanie -- who reportedly is awaiting gender reassignment surgery and now identifies as a man -- made a formal complaint to MSU officials for the “one-time, non-consensual touching.” \nMelanie cited being transgender as a key reason for coming forward, and claimed to fear encountering her ex-lover in the male bathrooms. \nThe complaint came after the school launched a revised sexual-harassment policy, one featuring more explicit definitions of sexual misconduct. Schools across the nation did the same, after the Obama administration threatened to withhold Title IX funding if schools did not crack down on sex assaults. \nThe case has since led to more than 2 ½ years of administrator investigations, legal bills and sanctions against Nathan – and it is not likely to be closed anytime soon. His attorney, self-titled feminist and progressive Deborah Gordon, said she intends to file a federal lawsuit against MSU on his behalf. \n“The so-called sexual harassment is not really sexual harassment. I have been doing these cases for more than 30 years. The breast touch occurred in the summer, off campus, the school was not in session, it had nothing to do with the school,” Gordon told Fox News. “Title IX does not require you to take cases when they don’t involve the school.” \nIn the firestorm over on-campus rapes during the Obama administration, Gordon said that Nathan fell victim to the get-tough policies that punished the accused even if the evidence against him or her was flimsy. In Gordon's view, his case was one of overzealous school administrators trampling on a student's civil liberties to protect the institution. \nThroughout his administration, Obama took a hard line against sexual violence on campus. In 2011, his Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights sent letters to college administrators across the country requesting tougher and faster enforcement for sexual assault cases, rendering institutions responsible for their dealings with such cases. The letter also threatened non-compliant schools with reduced federal financial support. \nThe Nathan and Melanie encounter took place prior to the implementation of the new guidelines; however, the gender studies professor tasked with the investigation incorrectly listed on the documents the date of the incident as being after the new guidelines were implemented, and so Nathan was investigated under the updated policy. \nNathan has not been charged with any type of crime by local authorities, but has been punished for sexual harassment by MSU under the Obama administration’s federal Title IX anti-discrimination law. The university’s ruling means it stays on his permanent record and he has to divulge the information when he is seeking employment. \n“This is not a rational result. You cannot deprive a student of his right to an education without due process of law. He had no opportunity for a hearing,” Gordon said. “And yet [he] is going to have a permanent record that says he engaged in sexual misconduct and that is a very serious thing. Apply for anything, and you are asked about your disciplinary record.” \nTo Gordon, this case is nothing short of overkill.
