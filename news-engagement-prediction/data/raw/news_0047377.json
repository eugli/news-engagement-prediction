Almost 20 employees at Bradley Coatings Incorporated, a painting company in Tennessee, were fired after not showing up to work, CNBC reports. The news channel obtained a statement from the company’s lawyer Robert Peal. The statement said that all employees had been warned they risked being fired for missing a day of work. The protest itself was not identified as the reason for the terminations. “The reason these employees missed work—to engage in peaceful demonstrations—had nothing to do with BCI’s decision to terminate them” said the statement. Two employees at the Grace Community School in Bonita Springs, Fla. have claimed that they were also fired after joining the protest. The head of the school said that no employees were terminated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T15:25:47.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
