What this means for genealogists and other researchers is that if you are only using the standard search boxes on FamilySearch to find records you are missing out on a very large percentage of what's available! \nTo see tips for using the search features of FamilySearch to find digitized records that are indexed and searchable, see Top Search Strategies for Finding Historical Records on FamilySearch . Image only historical records on FamilySearch can be browsed, but not searched. FamilySearch 1. Image Only Historical Records On FamilySearch \nOne of the easiest ways to find records which have been digitized but are not yet indexed (and thus, not searchable), select a location from the \"Research by Location\" area of the search page. Once you are on the location page, scroll down to the final section labeled \"Image Only Historical Records.\" These are records which are available digitally for browsing, but are not yet available through the search box. Many of these digitized records may also have digitized, handwritten indexes. Check the beginning and end of each section or book to see if such an index may be available. \ncontinue reading below our video 7 Meals Kids Can Cook (and Why They Should) Index to deed microfilms for Pitt County, North Carolina in the FamilySearch catalog. All 189 microfilms in this collection have been digitized and are available for browsing online. FamilySearch 2. Uncover Even MORE Digitized Records Through the FamilySearch Catalog \nFamilySearch is digitizing microfilm and making it available online at a rapid rate. As a result, there are thousands of rolls of digitized microfilm available online that have not yet been added to the FamilySearch database. To access these images, browse the FamilySearch Catalog for your location of interest and select a topic to view the individual microfilm rolls. If a roll has not been digitized, then only an image of a microfilm roll will appear. If it HAS been digitized, then you will also see a camera icon. \nThousands of rolls of digitized microfilm are currently accessible through the catalog, that have not yet been published in the FamilySearch database. This includes deed books and other land records for many U.S. counties, plus court records, church records, and more! Several of the eastern North Carolina counties that I research in have had their entire run of deed book microfilms digitized! Gallery view of digitized microfilm for Pitt County, NC Deed Books B-D, Feb 1762â€“Apr 1771. FamilySearch 3. FamilySearch Gallery View \nIn November 2015, FamilySearch introduced \"gallery view\" which displays thumbnails of all images in a particular image set. For the microfilms in the catalog which have been digitized, this gallery view is displayed once you click on the camera icon, and will typically include the entire microfilm. The thumbnail gallery view makes it much easier to quickly navigate to specific spots in the image set, such as an index. Once you select a specific image from the thumbnail view, the viewer zooms in on the particular image, with the ability to navigate to the next or previous image. You can return to thumbnail view from any image by clicking the \"gallery\" icon just below the plus/minus (zoom) buttons in the upper left-hand corner. FamilySearch 4. FamilySearch Image Access Restrictions \nIt is important to note that the thumbnail gallery in the FamilySearch catalog will respect all restrictions in place on particular record collections. Partnership agreements with certain record providers include restrictions on use and access to particular record sets. \nMost digitized films, such as the aforementioned North Carolina deeds, will be available to anyone at home with a FamilySearch log in. Some digitized records will be available for online access only to LDS members, or to anyone but only if accessed through a Family History Center computer (at the Family History Library or a satellite Family History Center). The camera icon will still appear for all users so you will be aware that the collection has been digitized. If the images are restricted, you will see a message when you try to view them informing you of the image restrictions and options for access.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:30:28.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
