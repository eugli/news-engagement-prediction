Rec As these stories often go, Islanders rookie Anthony Beauvillier scored a goal in his return to his hometown of Montreal on Thursday. Beauvillier is actually from Sorel-Tracy in Quebec, just a bit up the river from Montreal, but the drive is quick enough for 50 friends and family to make the trip to see him play in his first game back. So, when Beauvillier gave the Islanders a 1-0 lead early in their game against the Canadiens , you know it was bound to get emotional. So emotional in fact, that it made his father cry! A . What a moment. And hey, the goal isn’t half bad either! Beauvillier beats Price to give the Islanders a 1-0 lead. pic.twitter.com/RaOnqgWP5e — Marc Dumont (@MarcPDumont) February 24, 2017 Not a bad homecoming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:34:47.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
