I think the probability that somebody saw something is so low it's not something I am concerned about.\" 'Ancient software' \nMr Graham-Cumming has written a blog about what went wrong and how Cloudflare fixed it . \n\"Unfortunately, it was the ancient piece of software that contained a latent security problem and that problem only showed up as we were in the process of migrating away from it,\" he wrote. \nThe firm, whose strapline is \"make the internet work the way it should\", has also been working with the major search engines to get the data scrubbed from their caches - snapshots taken of pages at various times. \nIt was discovered by Google engineer Tavis Ormandy, who compared it to the 2014 Heartbleed bug . \n\"We keep finding more sensitive data that we need to clean up,\" he wrote in a log of the discovery . \n\"The examples we're finding are so bad, I cancelled some weekend plans to go into the office on Sunday to help build some tools to clean up.\" Dodged bullet \nCybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward said the bug had been caused by \"a few lines of errant code\". \n\"When you consider the millions of lines of code that are protecting us out there on the web, it makes you realise that there are bound to be other problems likely to be waiting to be found,\" he said. \n\"It's too soon to tell exactly what damage may have been done, but because of the way in which this was found the chances of individuals being compromised is relatively small. \n\"What it shows, bigly, is that we may have just dodged a bullet.\" Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:47:34.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
