Thiel reportedly solicited financial assistance from the CIA to help found his secretive firm Palantir, which helped the National Security Agency’s controversial domestic surveillance program.\nNot only did US intelligence agencies help the company financially when it was in its infancy, but it also reportedly collaborated with it in developing software used to gather sensitive information.\nThe software is so advanced that the NSA has bragged that Palantir has helped it make use of its 'widest reaching' data mining program that enables the agency to capture 'nearly everything a typical user does on the internet.'\nThe revelations were reported on Wednesday by The Intercept .\nThiel, who was also a co-founder of PayPal and one of the first to invest in Facebook, has generated headlines in recent months because of his close ties to President Donald Trump.\nAccording to the web site, Palantir has helped the US government and allied intelligence agencies abroad with espionage and intelligence-gathering.\nIn 2004, Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel (left) and Alex Karp (right) co-founded Palantir, a company that markets software and data services used primarily by counter-terrorism analysts\nThe company, which Thiel co-founded along with Alex Karp, markets software and services used primarily by counter-terrorism analysts.\nIts initial clients included US government agencies, particularly in the intelligence community, as well as the Pentagon, law enforcement bodies, and homeland security customers.\nIt has now been learned that Palantir was helped along in the early days by In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capital branch, which was one of the first investors in the company.\nPalantir also collaborated with the NSA in expanding its global spy network, the extent of which was revealed in the trove of documents leaked by Edward Snowden.\nThiel (right), who was also a co-founder of PayPal and one of the first to invest in Facebook, has generated headlines in recent months because of his close ties to President Donald Trump (left)\nThe company helped the NSA by providing it with sophisticated software that made it easier for the agency to use XKEYSCORE.\nThis program, the existence of which was first reported by The Guardian , is a top-secret tool which enables spies to search databases and access emails, online chats, and browsing histories of millions of unsuspecting Internet users.\nIt can also collect information that sheds light on individual’s social networking habits, voice calls, webcam photos, Skype sessions, chats, and other regular habits.\n‘An analyst using XKEYSCORE could pull every IP address in Moscow and Tehran that visited a given website or made a Skype call at 14:15 Eastern Time, for example, and then import the resulting data set into Palantir in order to identify additional connections between the addresses or plot their positions using Google Earth,’ according to The Intercept.\nPalantir's role in helping the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program was revealed in documents leaked by Edward Snowden. NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, is seen in the above stock photo\nThe Central Intelligence Agency, through its venture capital arm, helped found Palantir in 2004\nPalantir’s capabilities at large-scale data mining so impressed the British government signals intelligence agency, Government Communications Headquarters, that it began procuring the company’s services. GCHQ's headquarters in Gloucestershire, England, is seen above\nPalantir’s ability to facilitate the use of and simplify XKEYSCORE so impressed the British government signals intelligence agency, Government Communications Headquarters, that it began procuring the company’s services.\nThe GCHQ employed Palantir for a project code-named LOVELY HORSE, which was geared toward boosting the agency’s ability to collect ‘open source’ intelligence – namely information that was available on public internet domains, tweets, blogs, and news articles.\nPalantir was often called upon to collect ‘large stacks’ of data used by countries participating in the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence alliance – those of the US, UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.\nThe Intercept’s report cites glowing reviews given by officials with the spy agencies who marveled at Palantir’s capabilities.\nPalantir's vaunted computer program, Gotham, has historically been used to track the flow of weapons in the Middle East using manufacturing and weapons product data.\nPalantir’s close cooperation with foreign and domestic surveillance is sure to attract criticism from civil liberty advocates who say it is complicit in violating people’s privacy.\nIn 2014, Palantir was valued at $20 billion.\nPalantir's initial funding came from Thiel, who is a chairman in the company and who invested $30 million after Palantir was founded in 2004.\nAnother $2million came in 2005 from CIA's venture arm In-Q-Tel, which uses Palantir's products to help the intelligence agency break down large amounts of data.\nA private 2013 document which was leaked on Monday by TechCrunch shows that Palantir's other clients include the FBI, NSA, DHS and at least nine other US government groups.\nThe company’s ability to mine voluminous amounts of data is ironic given that Thiel himself fell victim to a violation of privacy.\nNot only did US intelligence agencies help the company financially when it was in its infancy, but it also reportedly collaborated with it in developing software used to gather sensitive information. Palantir's logo is seen above\nIn 2007, the online gossip site Gawker outed Thiel as a homosexual.\nLast year, Gawker was forced to close down after Thiel funded the lawsuit brought against the site by former wrestler Peter Bollea, better known as Hulk Hogan.\nBollea sued Gawker after it posted a sex tape involving Bollea.\nWith Thiel’s help, Bollea prevailed and Gawker was hit with $140million in penalties.\n‘Protecting individual dignity online is a long-term project, and it will require many delicate judgments,’ Thiel wrote in The New York Times last year.\n‘We can begin on solid ground by acknowledging that it is wrong to expose people’s most intimate moments for no good reason.’", "external_links": ["https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data", "https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/11/leaked-palantir-doc-reveals-uses-specific-functions-and-key-clients/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/opinion/peter-thiel-the-online-privacy-debate-wont-end-with-gawker.html", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "https://theintercept.com/2017/02/22/how-peter-thiels-palantir-helped-the-nsa-spy-on-the-whole-world/"], "published": "2017-02-23T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:46:50.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
