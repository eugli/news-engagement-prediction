Elizabeth Warren, if the two topped their parties tickets in the next presidential election.\nForty-two percent of registered voters surveyed said they would back the current Republican president, while 36 percent would get behind Warren, with another 22 percent undecided, as the next presidential election is three years and nine months away.\nScroll down for video\nIf the 2020 election was held today, President Donald Trump (left) would get more support than Sen. Elizabeth Warren, according to a new Politico/Morning Consult poll\nPresident Donald Trump gets bested by a generic Democrat, but he beats the liberal Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren\nIf Warren is taken out of the equation and replaced with a generic Democrat, that Democrat wins at this point in time.\nIn that scenario, Trump receives just 35 percent, while the Democrat receives 43 percent, with 23 percent of people undecided.\nMore broadly, 60 percent of respondents said the country is on the wrong track, while 40 percent said it's on the right track.\nTrump continues to have high disapproval numbers for a president so young into his administration.\nThis particular survey found that 49 percent of respondents approved of the job the businessman was doing, while 45 percent disapproved.\nWhen those numbers are broken out, 28 percent strongly approved of the president, while 21 percent somewhat approved.\nThe biggest chunk of respondents, 35 percent, said they strongly disapproved of Trump, while another 10 percent said they somewhat disapproved.\nWhen Americans were asked how they thought Trump would go down in history, again, the largest swath of respondents said he would be considered a 'poor president,' at 38 percent.\nSeventeen percent responded that he would be viewed as a outstanding president, 15 percent suggested he would be rated 'above average,' 9 percent said Trump would be an average president and 8 percent said he would be below average.\nIn comparison, 26 percent said President Barack Obama would be viewed as outstanding, 21 percent said he'd be above average, 17 percent believed Obama would be rated as an average president, 13 percent thought he would be considered a below average president.\nAnd 1-in-5, 20 percent, of Americans think Obama will be considered a poor president, when rated by history.\nRegistered voters had heard a lot about President Trump criticizing companies on Twitter, and in speeches too, with 45 percent saying they had heard about it 'a lot,' and 37 percent saying they heard about it 'some.'\nLast week, Trump raised eyebrows for taking on the department store Nordstrom, after the retailer announced it was dropping his daughter Ivanka Trump's line.\nA majority suggested he should knock that behavior off.\nSixty-one percent said the president should avoid criticizing companies, while 27 percent found that to be acceptable behavior.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-15T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T14:53:18.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
