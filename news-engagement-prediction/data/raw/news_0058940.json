For the religious, this is a time of reflection and family with well-attended Sunday services. For the children, Easter eggs - Osterei - will be decorated and much chocolate consumed. \nAnd for everyone else? Easter means a long weekend as Good Friday and Easter Monday are public holidays. German school holidays are usually around this time (about two weeks) meaning many people in Germany take this time to travel. While stores, government offices and banks are closed, hotels, museums, trains and roads will be extra crowded. \nHowever you choose to celebrate this holiday, Germany is ready to exult in spring .

Easter Bonfire \nWondering what to do with those pussy willows from your home-made Ostereierbaum ? Add it to the Easter bonfire on Sunday.
