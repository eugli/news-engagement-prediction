For the year, Antetokounmpo is averaging 23.5 points, 8.7 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game. \nAt 23-30 on the season, the Bucks are currently on the outside looking in when it comes to the Eastern Conference playoff race. Milwaukee trails current No. 8 seed Detroit Pistons by 1.5 games. \nHowever, a chance to make up ground will come quickly, as the Bucks host the Pistons on Monday night in Milwaukee. If the Bucks are going to win, though, they'll need another out-of-this-world game by their talented star.
