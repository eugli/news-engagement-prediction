From the “Maisy” series creator Lucy Cousins comes A Busy Day for Birds (Walker), a picture book aviary of brilliantly painted plumage. Full of funny instructions (“Say ‘Hello, darling!’ Then swoop like a starling”), it’s a riotous, interactive, zingingly colourful book – perfect to share with the very young. Elys Dolan’s Mr Bunny’s Chocolate Factory \nFor a subversive pre-Easter treat, Elys Dolan’s Mr Bunny’s Chocolate Factory (Oxford) is a splendid, Roald Dahl-esque introduction to capitalism, protest and working conditions. On a diet of chocolate, Mr Bunny’s poultry workforce lay perfect chocolate eggs; but what happens when he cranks up production, ignoring their demands for salad and aerobics? With a wealth of detail, some well-deserved comeuppance and a harassed quality-control unicorn, it will leave readers of all ages smirking. Laura Ellen Anderson’s I Don’t Want Curly Hair! Illustration: Bloomsbury \nFrom Evil Emperor Penguin creator Laura Ellen Anderson, meanwhile, is I Don’t Want Curly Hair! (Bloomsbury). Bouncily written, with a hint of Seuss (“I want my hair STRAIGHT / I want my hair smooth / I want it to flow through the air when I move”), this tale of unmanageable manes and joyful self-acceptance is full of textures, twirls and ill-judged straightening techniques. Abigail Goh and Anna Claybourne’s Where’s the Ballerina Illustration: Ivy Kids \nFor dance-mad 5-8-year-olds, Where’s the Ballerina? by Abigail Goh and Anna Claybourne (Ivy Kids) is a beautiful search-and-find book, featuring 10 classic ballets, including Romeo and Juliet , Swan Lake and Giselle . Read the story, then pore over a spread to spot the main characters, a ballerina in an elegant arabesque, and a sneaky peacock. It’s especially delightful for its lightly worn ethnic diversity. Chris and Andrew Judge’s Create Your Own Superhero Epic Illustration: Scholastic Children's Books \nChris and Andrew Judge’s latest collaboration, Create Your Own Superhero Epic (Scholastic), is impressively interactive – part Choose Your Own Adventure, part comic, part origami (readers are invited to tear, fold, draw and flip throughout). This cheerful, energetic book invites young storytellers to get stuck in, shaping their own narratives and playing with form as they do so. AL Kennedy’s Uncle Shawn and Bill and the Almost Entirely Unplanned Adventure Illustration: Walker Books \nThere’s more maniacal energy – though a slight dearth of restraint – in the first children’s book from AL Kennedy. In Uncle Shawn and Bill and the Almost Entirely Unplanned Adventure (Walker), a young badger falls foul of two dastardly sisters, who plan to pit him against terrifying fight dogs. It’s perhaps a pity that the adult Uncle Shawn is drafted in to save the day, but there are several belly laughs along the way – especially courtesy of Gemma Correll’s wide-eyed illustrations. \nMoving from badgers to bears, Mostly Mary (Egmont) is a charming reissue of Gwynedd Rae’s Mary Plain stories, first published in 1930. Clara Vulliamy’s joyous fuzzy-furred pictures are a perfect match for these down-to-earth tales of a mischievous, haughty, trouble-prone bear cub, set in the bear pits in Berne. (Purists may note that references to corporal punishment have been tactfully edited out.) \nAlso from Egmont, for readers of 8-12(ish), Katherine Woodfine’s The Painted Dragon is the third instalment of the Sinclair’s Mysteries, starring shop girl Sophie Taylor and chorus singer Lil in an atmospheric, fast-paced heist featuring art students, a priceless painting and an old adversary. While the puzzle at the heart of the book is not as taxing as in the previous two, strong character development and vividly evoked Edwardian settings make Woodfine’s work stand out in a genre already notable for richness. Stephanie Burgis’s The Dragon with a Chocolate Heart Illustration: Bloomsbury \nMore scaly wings are beating in Stephanie Burgis’s The Dragon with a Chocolate Heart (Bloomsbury), the appealing tale of Aventurine, a discontented young dragon still to find her vocation. When she is transmuted into human form, she must survive as a girl in an unfriendly town – a task made harder by her newfound ambition to become a chocolatier. With delicate chapter-head illustrations by Freya Hartas, this spicy, unexpected book takes several chances, and pulls them all off with panache. Trenton Lee Stewart’s The Secret Keepers Illustration: Diana Sudyka 2016 \nFor a more contemporary feeling though a timeless fantasy try The Secret Keepers (Chicken House), by Mysterious Benedict Society author Trenton Lee Stewart, with atmospheric illustrations by Diana Sudyka. In the desolate city of New Umbra, governed by the sinister, nebulous Smoke, Reuben finds a pocket watch with an extraordinary power and embarks on a quest to discover its owner. Complex, thought-provoking, original and evocative, it’s a stretching and satisfying read. \nFor teens and young adults, Lisa Williamson follows up her award-winning debut, The Art of Being Normal , with All About Mia (David Fickling), the story of a chronically underachieving middle child shown up by all-star sisters. When academic mastermind Grace turns up pregnant, surely their parents will cut Mia a break? Queen of poor decisions, risqué outfits and underage drinking, Mia is a likable and real-feeling teen heroine, and this is an absorbing, hilarious investigation of sibling dynamics. \nFor horror buffs, from Stripes’ Red Eye series, there’s Fir , a skin-crawling debut by Sharon Gosling. A teenage girl is disgruntled to be uprooted from Stockholm to remote northern Sweden – especially when blizzards cut the family off from civilisation. Hints of classic horror, courtesy of creepy children and a housekeeper who makes Daphne du Maurier’s Mrs Danvers look welcoming, meet Scandinavian werewolf legend in this tale of blood, forest and snow. \nFinally, DJ and presenter Gemma Cairney’s Open – A Toolkit for How Messed Up and Magic Life Can Be (Macmillan) is a chunky non-fiction splurge of glitter, anecdote and jubilation. With sections on mental health, sex, identity, family, politics and first love, it’s likely to appeal more to female readers at first glance (but would be invaluable for boys brave enough to sneak a peek). The intense, sometimes confessional tone, strongly personal throughout, may polarise readers, and some areas, such as the section on climate change, seem slightly perfunctory. Overall, however, it’s a valuable resource, full of reassurance for teenagers that they are not alone, whatever they feel. \n• Visit the Guardian Bookshop online or call 0330 333 6846 to browse the books in today’s roundup.
