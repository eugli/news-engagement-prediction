The trailers and posters of the film have piqued the curiosity of the audience and fans can't wait for the adventure romantic comedy to hit the screens. However, of late, rumours doing the rounds stated that the film may not keep its April 7 date. There's buzz that the release of 'Jagga Jasoos' may be pushed as certain portions of the movie have to be reportedly reshot.\nNow, director Anurag Basu has finally reacted to the rumours of 'Jagga Jasoos' being delayed further. The acclaimed filmmaker took to Twitter to clarify that they are contemplating pushing the film's release as the first week of April is a period when most schools hold their exams and hence, kids and families may not flock to the theatres to catch the film. However, Anurag made it clear that they will change the release date only if they get a better date - otherwise, the team is all geared up for April 7 release.\nHe wrote, \"#JaggaJasoos is a Family Holiday film Since exams r pushed at most of the places We r contemplating the delay Only IF v get a better Date\". He further added, \"But for now team is getting ready for 7th April.\"\n#JaggaJasoos is a Family Holiday film\nSince exams r pushed at most of the places\nWe r contemplating the delay\nOnly IF v get a better Date\n— anurag basu (@basuanurag) February 19, 2017 But for now team is getting ready for 7th April.\n— anurag basu (@basuanurag) February 20, 2017", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/basuanurag/status/833455792862830592", "https://twitter.com/basuanurag/status/833467902028165120", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/JaggaJasoos?src=hash"], "published": "2017-02-20T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:34:01.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
