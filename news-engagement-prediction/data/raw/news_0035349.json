It's absolutely crazy. [Trump] keeps repeating ridiculous, throwaway lines that are not true at all and sort of avoiding this issue of Russia as if we're some kind of fools for asking the question. Really? Your opposition was hacked and the Russians were responsible for it and your people were on the phone with Russia on the same day it was happening and we're fools for asking the questions?

Your supporters will support you either way. If your people were on the phone with her, what were they saying? We have a right to know - we absolutely do,\" Smith added. \"And that you call us fake news and put us down like children for asking these questions on behalf of the American people is inconsequential. The people deserve that answer at very least.\"\nSmith also defended CNN's White House correspondent Jim Acosta, who Trump went after during a lengthy press briefing on Thursday afternoon.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.
