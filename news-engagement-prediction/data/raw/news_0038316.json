Hindustan Times via Getty Images MNS leader Raj Thackeray greeting well wishers at his residence. ADVERTISEMENT \nOur politicians choose to do elections rallies in various ways-- some believe in traveling from one village to another ( yatras) either on their foot, or on raths . While others usually stand on a makeshift stage, addressing the crowd in an open field. The more techie ones among them are not even present there. The trend that was started by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was followed by several ministers. At a time when Modi was campaigning before the Lok Sabha election, he would magically address several rallies throughout the country at the same time-- using hologram technology. \nHowever, MNS chief Raj Thackeray has found a new way to inspire voters--Powerpoint Presentations. \nDuring an election rally, Thackeray showcased the achievements by the MNS through PPT presentations that is mostly used in corporate boardrooms. \nWatch the video here: \nThe MNSchief started his rallies on the 14th of this month. He had planned to address at least 36 rallies across the state for the civic elections, but has now restricted himself to just six by tomorrow. \nThackeray entered the race quite late even as the BJP, Shiv Sena and Congress have been busy indulging in a mud-slinging battle for a while now, preparing to gain control of the country's richest municipal body. \nIn the 2012 BMC elections, the MNS won 28 seats and came to power in Nashik. \nIn the battle for BMC, after the BJP and the Sena decided to go solo, Raj extended an olive branch to his estranged cousin and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. However, his offer was rejected. \nWho knows, probably the PPT presentations will just work for him. \nAlso see on HuffPost: 7 Incredible Pictures From National Geographic’s Best Photos Of 2016 7 Incredible Pictures From National Geographic’s Best Photos Of 2016 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T12:42:16.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
