Now it is a national campaign to end bullying. \nToday is Pink Shirt Day. \nTen years ago, David Shepherd and Travis Price were two high school students in Nova Scotia when they noticed a younger boy getting picked on for wearing pink. The next day, Shepherd and Price organized a protest by wearing and handing out pink shirts to their peers. \n“It was just a simple gesture,” says Price at today’s Pink Shirt event in Vancouver. “We thought if we could wear pink shirts, then this student would feel accepted.” \nThe Anti- Bullying Day was brought to British Columbia in 2008, from then on the last Wednesday in February would be known as Pink Shirt Day. \nLocal police and politicians got involved across the province: @RidgeRCMP Police Dog (in training) Jola with Constable George show the #PinkShirtDay spirit! pic.twitter.com/BoeiZLoch7", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:47:41.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
