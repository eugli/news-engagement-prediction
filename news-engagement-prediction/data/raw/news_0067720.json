It's more difficult to play away because of the fans, but we are ready, we are professional. We can deal with the pressure. Everything is going good,\" Hazard said.

Indeed, survival in the Premier League was our first and only target at the start of the campaign,\" Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha said. \n\"But we are now faced with a fight to reach that objective and feel a change is necessary to maximise the opportunity presented by the final 13 games.\" \nAssistant manager Craig Shakespeare and Mike Stowell have taken caretaker charge ahead of Monday's clash at the King Power Stadium. \nLiverpool can't afford any sympathy for Leicester's plight as they aim for a win that would take them back into the top four. \nJurgen Klopp's fifth placed team ended a run of five games without a win by beating Tottenham and Reds midfielder Adam Lallana, who signed a new contract this week, is confident of a strong finish to the season. \n\"We have a world-class manager and coaching staff and because it's Liverpool there is that added X-factor of the supporters and what success would mean to them when we achieve it here,\" Lallana said. \nThird placed Tottenham must beat Stoke at White Hart Lane on Sunday to keep alive their slender hopes of overhauling Chelsea. \nMauricio Pochettino's side are 10 points adrift of their London rivals after winning only one of their last four league matches. \n\"When we start a game, if you only watch 50 seconds, you don't need to be a genius to know we may struggle and have some problems in that game,\" Pochettino grumbled. \n\"The problem is when you start not in a good way, it's too difficult to change that perception and then you give a very good signal to the opponent that you are not focused on the game.\" \nSunderland manager David Moyes takes his bottom of the table side back to his old club Everton, while second bottom Crystal Palace face a crucial clash with fellow strugglers Middlesbrough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:40:57.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
