Zoe Saldana Welcomes Her Third Child, and It's a Boy! \nThe movie star and her husband recently welcomed their third son.   \nAxelle/Bauer-Griffin/Getty Images It's another boy for Zoe Saldana and her husband Marco Perego! The actress took to Instagram today to share the happy news. \nThe adorable photo shows their newest addition with his older brothers, 2-year-old twins Cy Aridio and Bowie Ezio . Saldana revealed her third little one's name is Zen (so cool!), writing, “Marco and I are elated to share the news of the birth of our son Zen. We couldn’t feel more blessed with the new addition to our family. #threeboys… oh boy!” \nHere's her beautiful announcement. A post shared by Zoe Saldana (@zoesaldana) on Feb 18, 2017 at 9:16am PST Oh boy is right! Back in January, she admitted to Extra that just juggling Cy and Bowie can be a lot . \"There’s one [saying] that just goes 'no quiero, no quiero' that means 'I don’t want to' in Spanish, and the other one goes, 'I don’t wanna,' so you’re just hearing a lot of nos!” she explained. \"There is a lot of patience we have to have.\" Thankfully, Saldana and Perego have gotten their fair share of practice with the twins and have a lot of support. \"We’re a good team, but we also have a great village, so his parents are around,\" Saldana told People back in July. \"And when they can’t [be], then my mother’s around, but we always have our nannies.\" New parent?   Babies newsletter The private actress, who didn't officially announce her first pregnancy and let her growing bump share the story, was similarly mum about the impending arrival of baby Zen. E! notes that the actress has not given details whether her new son was adopted at birth or born via surrogate. Congratulations to this wonderful new family of five!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T03:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:02:06.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
