Jason Wolf, USA TODAY Network 2:30 a.m. ET Feb. 6, 2017 CLOSE x Share Falcons players and coaches lamented mistakes and missed opportunities in their second-half collapse against the Patriots in Super Bowl LI. USA TODAY Sports Grady Jarrett (97) and the Falcons defense could only hold Tom Brady (12) and the Patriots in check for three quarters. (Photo: Bob Donnan, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON — Falcons defensive tackle Grady Jarrett sacked Tom Brady for the second time. Two plays later, he dropped him again, forcing the Patriots to settle for a field goal. \nIt was early in the fourth quarter, and Atlanta appeared well on the way to its first Super Bowl championship. \n\"I felt good. I was on. My moves were on,\" Jarrett said. \"I was playing the run well and pass rushing well. It just sucks when you come out on the losing end.\" \nBrady rallied New England to the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history, overcoming a 25-point deficit with just over 17 minutes to play to defeat the high-flying Falcons 34-28 in overtime in Super Bowl LI on Sunday night at NRG Stadium. It was the first Super Bowl in NFL history to require an extra session. The previous largest comeback in a Super Bowl was 10 points. \nMORE FROM SUPER BOWL LI: \nBrady, who was named MVP, completed 43-of-62 passes for 466 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. \nHow did the Falcons blow such a commanding lead? How did they allow 31 unanswered points? \n\"I think for sure we ran out of gas some,\" Falcons coach Dan Quinn said. \nAtlanta’s defense had dominated through three quarters. \nThe Patriots’ first seven possessions: punt, punt, fumble, punt, interception, field goal, punt. Their final five: touchdown, field goal, touchdown, touchdown, touchdown. And two of those touchdowns featured two-point conversions. \n\"It’s about execution, and momentum started to really work in their favor in the second half,\" Falcons veteran defensive end Dwight Freeney said. \"We couldn’t find a way to get it back.\" CLOSE x Share USA TODAY Sports' Lindsay H. Jones looks ahead to 2017 and what the Atlanta Falcons must do in the offseason if they're going to get back to the Super Bowl. USA TODAY Sports \nThe Falcons racked up five sacks, three by Jarrett and one each by Courtney Upshaw and Freeney. \nThey forced two turnovers. Robert Alford recovered a fumble and returned an interception 82 yards for a touchdown. They led 21-3 at halftime, were up 25 points late in the third quarter, held the Patriots to that field goal early in the fourth. \n\"To be up 25 points with a quarter left, 15 minutes left and to lose a game, that’s not easy,\" Falcons safety Ricardo Allen said. \nThe Patriots trailed 28-20 with 3:30 on the clock and two timeouts. They drove 91 yards in 10 plays and 2:33, highlighted by Julian Edelman catching a deflected pass for a 23-yard gain to the Atlanta 41, which the Falcons unsuccessfully challenged. \nMORE FROM SUPER BOWL LI: Patriots deserved Julian Edelman's spectacular catch \n\"(Brady) picked up on our game plan and started throwing quick passes,\" said outside linebacker Vic Beasley Jr. \nJames White scored on 1-yard touchdown run and Danny Amendola’s two-point conversion tied it with 57 seconds remaining. \nThe Falcons offense didn't touch the ball in overtime. \nNew England called heads and won the toss, then drove 75 yards in eight plays and 3:58, with White’s 2-yard touchdown run sealing the victory. \n\"I told them it’s going to be a four-quarter fight, and this was a five-quarter fight,\" Freeney said. \"Regardless of what happens, in the Super Bowl ... it’s a lot of ups and downs, and no matter what they do you have to try to respond, and we did that, we just didn’t do it enough. We didn’t make that one last play.\" Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Tom Brady hoists the Lombardi Trophy after the Patriots beat the Falcons to win Super Bowl LI.
