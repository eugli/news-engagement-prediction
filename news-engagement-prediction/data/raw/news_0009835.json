Sena president Uddhavji Thackeray has announced that we will not have a tie-up with any political party. He has made it clear that the Sena will hereafter be on its own...You must read the political meaning...At this point of time I would only say that the Fadnavis government is on notice,\" Raut told a Marathi television news channel. \n\nThis sparked speculation in political circles that the Sena may withdraw support to the BJP-led government after the Mumbai civic elections. A senior BJP functionary said, \"The Sena has no spunk to quit the government. This is not Balasaheb Thackeray's Sena. Raut's soundbyte is only to please Sena voters.\" \n\nPoll rhetoric or not, Matoshree will have to take a pragmatic view of the political situation, given the fact that several senior Sena ministers are reluctant to give up power and its trappings. At least two Sena ministers said to be very close to Fadnavis. Thackeray cannot overlook the fact that quitting the Fadnavis government may fuel fresh crisis in the Sena. \n\nAgain, many in the Sena are of the view that if the party walks out of the Fadnavis government, it will have to quit the BJP-led NDA too at the Centre--and face the Modi government's wrath. A party veteran said worriedly, \"The Narendra Modi regime may go on a vendetta spree if we snap all ties with the NDA.\" \n\nNevertheless, Raut's statement is an indication that pressure is mounting on Thackeray to map out the Sena's political course on its own steam, minus an ally, sources in the Sena Bhavan said. \n\n\"A sizeable section of the middle-rung and grass root level activists want the party to take a clean break with the BJP. The thought has begun to gather strength after Uddhav-ji decided to snap poll ties with the BJP for elections to 10 municipal corporations and 25 zilla parishads in the state,\" said a Sena 'vibhag-pramukh'. \"Uddhav-ji has ruled out (BJP national president) Amit Shah's statement that the BJP-Sena was playing a 'friendly match' in Mumbai,\" he pointed out. \n\n\"For many of our leaders who are in the Fadnavis government, ministership is like life time achievement award. They are close to 70 and are unable to understand the anti-establishment views of a young Shiv Sainik,\" said a Sena MLA. \n\nIf the Sena leaves the Fadnavis government, Thackeray will be in a better position to assert his authority, quell indiscipline in the party, infuse fresh blood in the organisation and face the electorate with far greater credibility, said analysts. \n\nStating that Raut was strongly in favour of ending the state-level alliance with the BJP, the vibhag-pramukh said, \"Rautsaheb is of the firm view that the Sena can prepare for the 2019 state assembly elections in Maharashtra right from now if we snap all ties with the BJP and quit the Fadnavis government.\" \n\nMeanwhile, senior Sena functionary Anil Parab on Monday riled Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar for alleging that the Sena-Congress had entered into a secret pact--'match-fixing'--to defeat BJP candidates in the upcoming Mumbai civic elections. \n\n\"Shelar keeps talking of match-fixing as he is Mumbai Cricket Association president...He picked up this term from MCA, I believe. I dare him to cite the number of seats where the Sena has entered into a pact with the Congress Party. The Sena doesn't stoop to such a level. We don't play dirty politics,\" said Parab. \n\nAddressing a BJP conclave at a south Mumbai auditorium on Sunday, Shelar said the Sena-Congress have decided to field candidates who are mutually complementary to the two parties in order to ensure the defeat of BJP candidates. \"Our report shows that this match-fixing has happened in 42 municipal wards in Mumbai,\" said Shelar. \n\nLambasting Shelar, Mumbai regional Congress committee chief Sanjay Nirupam said the Mumbai BJP president should furnish evidence in support of his allegation. \"Shelar should keep all details on the table and discuss the issue with me on a public platform...I will defeat him in the argument and he will have to offer me unconditional apologies,\" declared Nirupam.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T19:18:24.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
