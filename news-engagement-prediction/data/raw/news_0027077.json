And among them is Maulik Pancholy, who played Jack’s (too) loyal assistant Jonathan for seven seasons on NBC’s 30 Rock . Pancholy will play Dr. Nambue, the chief medical officer aboard the Starship Shenzou, Discovery ‘s primary vessel. (That makes him the new show’s Bones McCoy, right?) RELATED Star Trek: Discovery Gets Delayed Again by CBS, No Premiere Date Set \nJoining Pancholy in the Discovery cast are Terry Serpico ( Army Wives ), who will play Admiral Anderson, a high-ranking Starfleet official, and Sam Vartholomeos ( The Following ), who will play Ensign Connor, a junior officer assigned to the Shenzou. \nCBS All Access’ Trek series is off to a rocky start — there’s still no premiere date set , after several delays and a showrunner change — but the cast is shaping up nicely. The Walking Dead ‘s Sonequa Martin-Green will star as a lieutenant commander, and Michelle Yeoh will play the Shenzou’s Captain Georgiou. Plus, James Frain ( True Blood , Orphan Black ) is set to play Spock’s father Sarek , which connects Discovery back to the original Trek series. If you like TVLine, you'll LOVE our weekly newsletter.
