Geologists 'stuck to his guns' \nHowever, Dr Sprigg was right and the fossils, now believed to be more than half a billion years old, had not been documented anywhere in the world. \nDoug Sprigg said his father had faith that other geologists would soon recognise the fossil's worth.

(Supplied) \nHe soon convinced Sir Douglas that the imprints were more than just natural markings on the rock. \n\"Dad stuck to his guns and it turned out that is was the oldest complex life on earth,\" Mr Sprigg said. \nPartly due to this research, Dr Sprigg is now one of Australia's most celebrated geologists and conservationists. \nOne fossil he found, which has only been located in the Flinders Ranges, was named the Spriggina, in honour of him. He loved science and the natural world \nIt is now South Australia's first fossil emblem, an announcement that Doug Sprigg said his father would be humbled by. \n\"He wasn't too big-headed about things, he wasn't worried about his part in the process,\" he said. \n\"He was interested in understanding evolution and life. \n\"Being with him was a bit like being with Sir David Attenborough he couldn't help but be emerged by things and he had a love of science and the natural world around him.\" \n\"He was an economic geologist but he recognised that conservation was going to become more and more important.\" \nMr Sprigg said he hoped creating a state fossil emblem would lead to more people studying geology. \n\"I hope it gets kids more interested in sciences, there's going to be lots more discoveries,\" he said. \n\"We're only scratching the surface of that life development and there are bits missing along the way from there on to where we are now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:06:04.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
