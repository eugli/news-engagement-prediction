I bought the t-shirt that night and I've worn it to every concert since.\" \nAccompanying Mark is fellow 'superfan' Brian Burke who will have seen Springsteen 63 times. \n\"My wife is a very patient woman,\" he said. \n\"When we booked tickets for this show we were in a campervan in rural Romania. \n\"It was about 4 o'clock in the morning and I was frantically trying to find wi-fi and a light enough area to see the buttons to order the tickets. \n\"I woke my wife up to help me punch in the credit card numbers.\" \nBoth men agreed that the best tickets in the house were general admission. \n\"You want to stand, move around a bit, have a dance, be free of the seat,\" Mr Burke said. \n\"We were really lucky, we got standing tickets for all the gigs in Australia and New Zealand. \n\"And every show is different. He pulls songs out which you don't expect, he plays other people's songs, he mixes it up all the time. \n\"You can see him back-to-back and he'll play totally different shows.\" Photo: Mark Ryder declares his fandom with ink. (ABC News: Pat Emmett) \nAs a faithful follower of the Springsteen church of rock and roll, Mr Ryder has spent more than 70 hours in the tattoo parlour getting inked. \n\"It's a full back tattoo with the E Street Band, an outline of Clarence Clemons and then it's all collaged in,\" he said. \n\"I keep adding to it. It's like, as Bruce blossoms, so does my tattoo. \n\"It's just missing one thing. I'd love him to sign it. \n\"I think he's aware of it, but if I ever met him I'd get him to sign my back; that would really finish it off.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:36:35.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
