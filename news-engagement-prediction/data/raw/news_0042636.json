According to a tweet from the man himself, it's really, officially not happening this time. \n[embed: https://twitter.com/RealGDT/status/834057572550324227 ] \nThere have been flares of flaming hope in the last few years, hope that was then quashed by the hard realities of filmmaking. Hellboy 3 is not a movie that can necessarily be made by crowdfunding, and rights issues make shopping it around tough. \nSo despite the driving passion of GDT, Ron Perlman and others to finish the trilogy with one more film, the book appears closed on that front. Of course, there remains the chance that del Toro could find some other outlet for the story, especially in comic book form. Which would be fitting given Big Red's roots. \nAnd at least we get to enjoy more del Toro filmmaking: his latest, The Shape Of Water , should be with us later this year.
