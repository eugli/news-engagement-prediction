They signed free agents Michael Saunders and Joaquin Benoit . They re-signed Jeremy Hellickson and Andres Blanco . They acquired Howie Kendrick , Clay Buchholz and Pat Neshek in trades. But while those moves improved the roster, the biggest difference between this year's team and last year's team is experience. The Phillies believe they will be better if their younger players simply use the experience they have gained to make improvements. \nThe offense already showed some signs of improvement in 2016. It averaged 3.33 runs per game in April and 3.0 runs per game in May, but 4.07 runs per game in June, 3.78 runs per game in July, 4.31 runs per game in August and 4.07 runs per game in September. Nobody will ever confuse them for the 2008 Phillies, who averaged 4.93 runs per game, but the bats have shown enough of an uptick to make the team believe it will continue to move in the right direction. \nMackanin cited third baseman Maikel Franco as another example. Franco, 24, hit .255 with 25 home runs, 88 RBIs and a .733 OPS last season, which was his first full season in the big leagues. Not bad, but not great. Certainly not what the Phillies need from a hitter in the middle of their lineup. \n\"I don't consider that a good year for him,\" Mackanin said. \"Even though for most people it's a real good year. I expect a lot out of him. I think he's going to improve with experience. I think he's going to blossom into a perennial All-Star-caliber player.\" \nThere are others, too. There is Odubel Herrera , Cesar Hernandez , Freddy Galvis , Cameron Rupp and Tommy Joseph in the field; Jerad Eickhoff , Vince Velasquez and Aaron Nola in the rotation; and Hector Neris and Edubray Ramos in the bullpen. \nIf those players alone make incremental improvements and the veterans do what they are supposed to do, .500 should be realistic. \nPitchers and catchers report to camp on Feb. 13 and the first full-squad workout is Feb. 17. has covered the Phillies since 2003, and for MLB.com since 2009.
