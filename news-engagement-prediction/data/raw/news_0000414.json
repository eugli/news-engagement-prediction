What lures Diddy, Justin Timberlake, One Direction, the Jonas Brothers & Cameron Diaz to a hotel named after an imaginary British rocker? \nThe best Houston Super Bowl star-gazing may be at the opulent yet urbane Hotel Derek , just across busy I-610 from the state’s largest mall, the Galleria. The Derek itself is a rock star: sexy, sleek and the place to preen and be seen. Ciara got engaged here -- Instagramming her 15-carat rock -- while Drake is so enraptured he’s rapped about it. So why do they care? \nSWEET SUITES: \nA rolling wardrobe rack and purple calla lilies greeted a superstar who arrived midweek at one of two 1,200-square-foot penthouses. Mid-Century modernists Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams dressed both, as well as TV’s The Good Wife sets, but a shower big enough for six was what enticed Shaquille O’Neal. All 312 rooms have floor-to-ceiling windows and sexy snakeskin printed loos. Six concept suites -- with funky fleece chairs and psychedelic wallpaper -- would have Austin Powers exclaiming “Oh, behave!” A photo posted by HOTEL DEREK (@thehotelderek) on Oct 19, 2016 at 3:22pm PDT \n\nBEST DISH: \nEn route from airports, celebs have ordered Derek’s burger, topped with pimento cheese and housemade pickles. A photo posted by HOTEL DEREK (@thehotelderek) on Oct 27, 2016 at 3:21pm PDT \n\nThe Uptown Manhattan is a twist on tradition, with housemade ginger liqueur. A photo posted by HOTEL DEREK (@thehotelderek) on Nov 7, 2016 at 2:16pm PST \n\nULTIMATE AMENITY: \nEvoking Fifty Shades of Grey , the hotel will cover beds with pillows and boxing gloves. “You’re free to let your inner-child out,” says marketing director Stephanie Summerall. “And once you’re exhausted, we send up milk and warm chocolate chip cookies.” A photo posted by HOTEL DEREK (@thehotelderek) on Aug 10, 2016 at 9:33am PDT \n\nPOSH PUPPY PERKS: \nThose barking mad for pampered pooches will love Derek’s doggy delights, including a bandana, organic treats made of cage-free chicken or wagyu beef and veggies and the off-leash outdoor Wag Lounge, with its fire hydrant and Astroturf (a home-grown invention). A photo posted by HOTEL DEREK (@thehotelderek) on Jun 5, 2016 at 3:33pm PDT \n\nPAP-FREE PRIVACY: \nKey access is limited to one’s own floor and famed faces can slip in discreetly via two entrances: one hidden, the other with a valet area that can be draped. Says Summerall, “Discretion is of the utmost importance.” \n2525 West Loop South, hotelderek.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:38:56.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
