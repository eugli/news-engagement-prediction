It will also record information about vaccinations, breastfeeding and “child development” as well as automatically sending out reminders for immunisations and health reviews. Mr Stubbs said: “Servelec’s unique health and social care proposition, across mental health, child health, community health, acute hospitals, social care and education services, provides health and care services with best of breed solutions that support the sharing of records across care settings and the delivery of the new models of care.” This data sharing risks breaching last year’s Supreme Court ruling on the SNP’s unlawful Named Person policy, which judges described as “totalitarian” in its intrusion into family life. GETTY The contract will replace an old patient information storage system with a new one The SNP have centralisation hard-wired into their DNA. They seem to have no qualms about amassing people’s personal and sensitive information Liam McArthur MSP At a recent NSS meeting, Professor Elizabeth Ireland, chair of the special health board, asked “what had been done to explore opportunities to increase Child Protection with the introduction of the new system”. Implementation Manager IT Mark Stewart replied the database was “not the vehicle for GIRFEC (Getting it Right for Every Child)” but admitted that “additional opportunities for use of the system could be explored later”. The meeting also heard the EMPI was urgently required to replace the “highly labour intensive paper based system”, which will be “obsolete and unsustainable” within five years. Despite a funding gap of £14m, the Scottish Government told NSS there “would be no new money available” to help pay for the 10 year projects. GETTY A Scottish Liberal Democrat blasted the SNP's plans Asked about the maximum cost of the programme, “Mr Stewart noted there could be no guarantee that costs would not increase. A range of final costs between £60m and £75m should be allowed for”. And, after previous bungled IT projects involving the police, farm payments and NHS 24, among others, the committee also agreed it was “essential that NSS avoid the reputational issues that had impacted other public sector organisations”. Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Liam McArthur MSP said the upgrade was a step closer to the SNP's proposed \"Super ID Database\", which would see health records shared across the entire public sector. He added: “The SNP have centralisation hard-wired into their DNA. They seem to have no qualms about amassing people’s personal and sensitive information.\" Corbyn confronts May over the NHS crisis Wed, February 22, 2017 Play slideshow 1 of 7 A spokesman for NHS NSS confirmed the estimated cost and said: \"This project allows us to upgrade and modernise current systems, providing an efficient and sustainable service. It is part of an ongoing process within NSS to upgrade IT systems.” The Scottish Government said money will only exchange hands at the end of the successful delivery of key stages meaning officials are trying to avoid repeating past mistakes. A spokesman insisted: “This is not a new database, but updates to existing systems. The procurement of these critical systems was a full OJEU procurement led by NSS overseen by a Governance Board chaired by a Board Chief Executive with a broad spectrum of key stakeholders. The funding for the entire project is fully in place.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:08:58.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
