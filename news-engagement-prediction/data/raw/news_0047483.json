Originally, Monday 20th Februaryâ€™s visit to Walford would see Denise Fox engage in a dramatic showdown with troublesome Keegan but it has now been shifted to Tuesday as a football match is airing instead. \nEastEnders has been replaced a number of times recently and fans have been left frustrated by the lack of consistency with the schedules â€“ even though the episodes are always made up at later dates with double or hour long editions. \nThe FA Cup match, kicking off at 7:30pm, is between Arsenal and Sutton United but viewers arenâ€™t feeling very sporting by the lack of Mondya night Albert Square action. How many more times does #eastenders have to be replaced by football!!! ðŸ‘Ž oh wait its happening again on Monday ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜  \nâ€” jade ogom (@jadeyyogom) February 14, 2017 @BBCOne . @bbceastenders . so why not cancel another programme for football fed up you always take of eastenders #not happy \nâ€” leeanne Adlam (@leeannemccourtx) February 14, 2017 Getting really fed with schedule changes due to football,don't see corrie or emmerdale getting messed about like this #eastenders ðŸ˜¾ \nâ€” Donna O'grady (@OgradyDonna) February 14, 2017 \nLast week, fans were treated to an hour long episode of the soap on Thursday and there was an additional episode the previous week. So itâ€™s very much a case of swings and roundabouts. \nEastEnders will continue on Tuesday 21st February at 7:30pm on BBC One.
