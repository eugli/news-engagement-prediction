Henson’s Glamorous Oscars 2017 Alberta Ferretti Look Is An Homage to Katherine Johnson  21 AM by Marjon Carlos Photo: Getty Images Hidden Figures star Taraji P. Henson is known for her dramatic range as an actress. And as she stepped onto the Oscars red carpet tonight in custom Alberta Ferretti, the star seemed to be revealing another layer of herself. The sleek and vampy off-the-shoulder midnight blue velvet gown was a far cry from the romantic and frothy semi-sheer Reem Acra concoction she wore to last month’s SAG Awards. But as Henson told Vogue.com, the Ferretti gown spoke to the “strength and brilliance” of her onscreen Figures character Katherine Johnson. The plunging neckline and high slit detail of the silhouette also gave a heavy nod to the glamor of Old Hollywood, an era which her stylist Jason Bolden explained is a constant reference point for the two. “For this look, our inspiration was vintage Hollywood glamour—a consistent go-to for us,” he said. \"Taraji is fun and known for the big characters she plays in film and on television. But she's also multifaceted, so we went with showing her other side.” Photo: Courtesy of Taraji P. Henson When presented with the idea of working with Ferretti on the custom design, Henson immediately gravitated toward the line’s feminine slant. \"I fell in love with the romantic clothes she creates for women,” she says. Henson and Bolden began researching and devising the look before the annual Oscar Nominations Luncheon this January. In between Henson filming Empire , Bolden flew to Chicago for a quick fitting with his client. “Fittings with Taraji are always so much fun! Short and sweet is how we approach things,” he says. “We do a tremendous amount of editing before we get to her. We share the belief that one doesn't need a room full of clothes to decide on one brilliant choice.” Accenting the gown was a flurry of diamonds (“I’m never upset with diamonds!” says Henson), with Jimmy Choo sandals on her feet. And her signature bob—coiffed to its fullest in throwback waves—was the perfect finish for a winning look.
