What for? \nHas he softened his anti-abortion stance? I don’t think so. \nPolitical activist and Catholic Bernie Gaynor issued a statement calling on the Archbishop to clarify his position. Fair enough. \nGaynor said: “ As the most senior bishop in Queensland, Archbishop Coleridge has an important duty to present Church teaching clearly on abortion. Catholics are entitled to an unambiguous statement from Archbishop Coleridge clarifying two key issues: \n1. Can a Catholic support abortion in any circumstances? \n2. Is there a penalty of excommunication attached to formal co-operation with abortion? \n“Unless the Archbishop answers these questions, it is likely that his unclear statements and subsequent apology will give the impression to Catholics that they can support abortion. \n“Further, pro-abortion ‘Catholic’ politicians will probably even use Archbishop Coleridge’s statements and apology to justify their support for abortion. \n“This situation is scandalous. \n“Catholic bishops are entitled to comment on proposed laws. However, it would be helpful for all if those comments were made clearly and without equivocation.” \nGaynor believes Coleridge’s comments “left open the possibility that it is acceptable for a Catholic to support abortion”. \nHe said: “Archbishop Coleridge was quoted in The Sunday Mail that: ‘[I]it would seem to me that to be a protagonist to this type of legislation is very hard to reconcile with anything that resembles true Catholic faith.’ \n“As such, it appears the Archbishop is suggesting that — while it would be very hard — in some circumstances a person could support abortion in a way that reconciles with and resembles the true Catholic faith. \n“Secondly, this lack of clarity is further clouded because Archbishop Coleridge subsequently apologised for his comments. This occurred after he was criticised by the Deputy Premier, Jackie Trad, who claims to be a pro-abortion Catholic. \n“One could be forgiven for forming the impression that Ms Trad, rather than Archbishop Coleridge, was dictating Catholic belief and teaching in Queensland.’’ \nTwo Bills are expected to be debated in Parliament today.
