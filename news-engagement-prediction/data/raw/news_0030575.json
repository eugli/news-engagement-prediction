The incident occurred at Adimali Kampiline.\nBaburaj had bought the land, which is close to his resort 'Emerald', from Sunny. However, he had not made the full payment and there was some dispute over it between them. In a bid to settle the issue, Adimali police had called for a meeting between them on Wednesday.\nHowever, the situation worsened when Baburaj and his workers tried to drain a pond on his property. There was reportedly a condition that he should not drain the pond before making the full payment. The residents around the area used to depend on the pond for water. They, along with Sunny, tried to prevent Baburaj leading to a clash during which Sunny allegedly hacked the actor. Though he was hacked on the chest, the wound is not serious.\nBaburaj was initially admitted to a hospital at Adimali, but was later shifted to Rajagiri Medical Centre, Ernakulam.\nSunny has been taken into custody, police said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:54:20.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
