Considering that Corporate America didn't exactly light up on the top and bottom lines during the fourth quarter, such a streak is rather troublesome. Granted, the stock market is a forward-looking mechanism that appears to be trading on hopes that Trump's unannounced stimulus and tax plans will be lifting economic growth in 2018. Even so, the inability of investors to at least acknowledge persistent struggles among companies and ongoing chaos in Washington is starting to become disturbing.\nA few simple charts nicely explain what looks to be irrational exuberance on the part of Wall Street right now (shout out, Alan Greenspan). The price-to-sales ratio of the S&P 500 is only about 8% shy of the level that it reached in 1999. We all know what happened shortly thereafter thanks to the fallout in the tech sector. To be sure, the Federal Reserve being more hawkish on interest rates this year could be akin to when people began to question tech earnings and the sector's business models back in the day -- it served as the trigger for a steep selloff in what was richly valued equities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:06:29.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
