The case reached a divorce court in Oxford in 2015 when Judge Robin Tolson QC decided Mrs Crowther, who has a stake in an online jewellery business, should keep the house. Only a half share would be enough for Mr Crowther to buy his own property and that would be unfair, given that it was his ex-wife's inheritance which paid for the property in the first place, he said. Making her sell up and move to a less affluent part of town might be too much for the mother-of-one, who has had mental health issues in the past, he added. He added that he was not sure that Mr Crowther, who uses a wheelchair and walks with sticks, would actually be able to live independently, due to his disabilities. But at the Court of Appeal, Mr Crowther's lawyers insisted that the judge had not properly considered his needs in making the decision. The couple split 10 years ago but have had a long running battle over the £200,000 property in Worksop, Nottinghamshire 'The husband's case had been consistently that his physical and emotional needs were not being met whilst living in a first floor room with his parents,' said barrister Thomas Dance. 'Not just because he is heavily reliant on a wheelchair, but also because he is 40 years old and needs independence.' He added: 'His only means of achieving independence and personal confidence would be by housing himself independently.' The question whether or not he would actually be capable of living on his own had never been raised by Mrs Crowther, he said. It was Judge Tolson who had come up with the point and then overstepped the mark when questioning Mr Crowther about it. The divorcee was dragged screaming from court after being told she might lose her home to her ex-husband - almost ten years after they split Allowing the appeal, Lord Justice McFarlane, sitting with Lady Justice Macur and Lord Justice Henderson, agreed that Judge Tolson had gone too far. Mr Crowther had been given no advance warning that his ability to live alone would be questioned, and so had no time to prepare evidence, he said. 'It is plainly part of the wife's case that it is simply unfair that he should now be awarded any further sums from her finances,' he added. 'I can understand why both parties wish to achieve closure on this issue, which has been open between them for nearly ten years.' Having allowed the appeal, the judges ordered that the case be sent back to a family judge to decide what Mr Crowther is entitled to. The ruling immediately sparked Mrs Crowther's rant, as she screamed that she was in 'a cage' and said she would 'kill' her ex-husband. Mr Crowther's lawyers attempted to placate her but security had to be called to remove her from the building.
