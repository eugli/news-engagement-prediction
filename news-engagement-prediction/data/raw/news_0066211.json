Image copyright ABC Image caption She was found in a dry canal bed near the local high school \nIn a prepared statement the family wrote: \"We know that our Father in Heaven is watching over her, and all of us have been touched by her. \n\"We know that He hears and answers prayers, and we can see His hand at work as Deserae continues to make progress.\" \nDeserae was found early Friday morning by friends who had tracked her location using her mobile phone information, which authorities provided. \nThe case has unnerved the small community. \n\"This has kind of shaken up our citizens,\" Chief of Police Travis Allen told reporters after the charges were revealed. \n\"We haven't seen things like this before.\" \nHe said many of the girl's possessions were found with the two boys. Image copyright ABC Image caption Deserae had been in mobile phone contact with one of the boys earlier in the day, police say. \nPolice were advised that the original plan was to murder [the girl] using knives,\" Cache County Attorney James Swink wrote in charging documents. \nBut one of the teens also carried a .22-caliber revolver as a \"secondary weapon,\" if the original plan failed, Mr Swink charged. \nAfter the boys were arrested, the alleged gunman told them where to find the gun, and the shell casing - which the other boy had taken to keep \"as a memento\". \nHe also penned a letter to the girl's family in which he wrote that he as \"so, so, so sorry\", authorities say. \nThe police later found the shell \"displayed\" on the boy's window sill. \nInvestigators also say they found shoe prints in the soil that match the Nike and Vans sneakers worn by the two boys. \n\"I haven't seen anything like this case in the 18 years I've worked in Cache County,\" the prosecutor said at Tuesday's news conference.
