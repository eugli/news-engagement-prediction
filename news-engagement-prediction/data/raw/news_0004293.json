I've always said that openly because he grew up in a family which was similar to the Neapolitans and then with me. \n\"I know that De Laurentiis (Napoli chairman) knows him, and with Zlatan you never know what could happen.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T22:06:56.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
