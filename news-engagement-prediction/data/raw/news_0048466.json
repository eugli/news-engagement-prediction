He Didn’t. by David Bixenspan | 12:59   \nOn Tuesday morning, former Senator Rick Santorum appeared on CNN’s “New Day” to debate President Donald Trump’s lack of comment (until the last day or so) on the uptick in anti-Semitism in the United States in the last month or so. Host Chris Cuomo moderated a discussion between Santorum and former New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn where Santorum immediately said that he didn’t know why Trump hasn’t tweeted about the topic and said he wished he would. However, the former senator quickly pivoted to an attack on Barack Obama . \n“I’ve got to tell you, Chris, this is why you hear about fake news,” he said. “For eight years — eight years! — the Obama administration sat by and said nothing about the increasing anti-Semitism on college campuses! Coming from all over the place: Coming from pro-Palestinian groups, from Muslim groups, from progressive groups, I mean rampant antisemitism, on the most liberal college campuses, and the President of the United States said and did nothing. And no comment from the national news media, not a word, no outrage being waged against President Obama for his lack of sympathy for Jews on college campuses.” \nWhen Cuomo tried to interject and let Quinn jump in, Santorum added that “It’s an outrage you guys are pointing to this 30 days in, and for eight years you ignored that story!” \nIn fact, Obama addressed antisemitism on college campuses during his Holocaust Remembrance Day speech at the Israeli Embassy 13 months ago : \nHere, tonight, we must confront the reality that around the world, anti-Semitism is on the rise. We cannot deny it. When we see some Jews leaving major European cities — where their families have lived for generations — because they no longer feel safe; when Jewish centers are targeted from Mumbai to Overland Park, Kansas; when swastikas appear on college campuses — when we see all that and more, we must not be silent. \n[Photo: CNN screen grab] \n\nThis is an opinion piece.
