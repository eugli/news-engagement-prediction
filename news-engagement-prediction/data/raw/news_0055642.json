The ball is scheduled during the same time slot as the Oscars, notes The Washington Post. \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that President Donald Trump and his wife will not be watching the awards show when asked at a Feb. 22 press conference whether the president would tune into the show in case there is another \"Meryl Streep moment,\" referring to the \"Florence Foster Jenkins\" actress denouncing the president during most of her speech while accepting a lifetime achievement Golden Globe on Jan. 8.   \n\"The president will be hosting the Governors Ball that night,\" Spicer said, according to The Washington Post. \"The first lady has put a lot of time into this event, welcoming our nation's governors to the capital. I have a feeling that's where the president and first lady are going to be focused on Sunday night.\" \nPresident Trump hit back at Streep on Twitter on Jan. 9, calling her \"one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood,\" after she spoke out against him for what she described as mocking a disabled reporter, although Trump has maintained he did no such thing. \n\"This instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing,\" Streep said in her acceptance speech, according to The New York Times. \"Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.\" \nMelania has been living with her son Barron in New York City and intends to do so for the remainder of the school year, so she has not spent much time at the White House, notes The Washington Post. The Feb. 26 ball will be the first time she officially hosts guests as First Lady.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:54:18.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
