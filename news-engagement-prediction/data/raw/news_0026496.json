(ABC News: Jessica Kidd) \nWarrumbungle mayor Peter Shintin said most residents have not yet been allowed to return because of safety concerns. \n\"The fire ground is active and there are vehicles people zooming all over the place to put spot fires out and black out areas that are still burning. \n\"But as fast as we can the area will be open and as soon as they're open people can start to move around again but it's not a good situation at the moment,\" he said. \nThe number of homes lost was expected to climb, he said. \nThe fire-ravaged area also faces another challenge. \n\"The biggest problem in the area is that it's old housing and old sheds probably full of fibro sheeting so now we've got the asbestos problem … [so] unless people take special precautions you can't let them go back.\" Photo: The small town of Uarbry was destroyed. (ABC News: Jessica Kidd) \nThere are fears there could be thousands of stock losses. \nDepartment of Primary Industries state emergency coordinator Simon Oliver said the charred landscape made it difficult to determine the full numbers. \n\"We're hoping that it is anecdotal,\" he said. Locations of destroyed houses: Sir Ivan Fire (Warrumbungle including Uarbry) – 23 homes destroyed (50 per cent of area assessed) Pappinbarra Fire (Port Macquarie-Hastings) - 4 homes destroyed Spring Hill Road, Dondingalong Fire (Kempsey) - 2 homes destroyed (one habitable) Binalong Road, Boggabri (Narrabri) - 1 home destroyed \n\"We sometimes hear this with the fires and in a lot of cases stock that are sort of written off are actually found. \n\"So we're just hoping that as we get further afield through the fire zone that we actually find that there's been some good stories about survival and not the other.\" \nThe Insurance Council said while it was still too early to assess the full extent of fire damage, staff were on stand-by to handle claims in the central west. \nThe council's Campbell Fuller said people should take photos of damaged property when it was safe to do so and speak to insurers before authorising any repairs. \n\"The Insurance Council and its members are monitoring the impact of bushfires that are raging right across regional New South Wales,\" he said. \n\"We're sending a staff member to the central west who'll be on deck to help affected policy holders and also liaise with emergency services.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:01:42.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
