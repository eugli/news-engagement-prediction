Photo: Cicadas are quite vulnerable after hatching from the nymph shell. (ABC Northern Tasmania: Fred Hooper) \nThe majority of tree trunks are covered in ghost-like shells of young cicadas that have emerged from the ground to hatch. \nThe shells are actually the remains of the larval stage that lives underground, sucking nutrients from tree roots, and can remain there for long periods of time. \n\"They spend two or three years underground as a larvae, and then on a warm summer's evening, usually around the middle of December, they'll all emerge out of the ground in huge numbers,\" Mr Fearn said. \n\"When it [the cicada] first comes out it's all soft and white and the wings are tiny little buds. It then has to pump blood into its wings and expand them out.\" \nIt can take several hours for the cicada wings to harden before the insect takes flight and searches for a mate. \nEven though the red eye cicada found in Tasmania hatches annually, the number can fluctuate depending on the conditions a few years earlier. Photo: The cicadas will live in the ground for two to three years in this state. (ABC Northern Tasmania: Fred Hooper) \n\"From year to year the numbers vary widely, so some years there are millions and millions of them and other years they're quite scarce,\" Mr Fearn said. \nAs Mr Fearn walks through the bushland reserve, he points out a number of adult cicadas that have not been able to make it from the lower section of the tree trunks. \n\"If you walk around the bush now, you'll see quite a few adults that are fairly sick, they're fairy slow, they're fairly sluggish,\" he said. \n\"They haven't got the energy to get up high anymore.\" Photo: The 2016 Tasmanian winter provided good conditions for cicada-breeding over summer. (ABC Northern Tasmania: Fred Hooper) \nMr Fearn said the best indicator of future numbers was the weather conditions about two years before hatching. \nWith cicada numbers strong this year, Mr Fearn has predicted an even larger season in a few years after a wet 2016 winter. \n\"If the ground is baked rock hard and it's super hot, they [the nymph cidadas] probably don't survive as well as ones that hatch in a good season like this season,\" Mr Fearn said. \n\"I would expect in two or three years time that there will be a mass emergence.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T15:30:53.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
