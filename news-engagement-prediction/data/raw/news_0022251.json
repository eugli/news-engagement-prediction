TNN & Agencies | Updated: Feb 8, 2017, 07.08 PM IST Highlights The war on corruption and black money is not against any particular political party, PM Modi said today PM Modi said the honest forces can be empowered only if there's strict action against the corrupt He slammed the opposition for constantly criticizing the demonetisation decision Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said his government's war against corruption was not a fight aimed against his political opponents. \"There is no reason to believe the fight against corruption and black money is a political fight. It is not to single out any particular political party,\" PM Modi said during a debate in the Rajya Sabha. Defending his November 8 decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, the Prime Minister said the step was to empower the poor and the honest. \"Honest forces will not be empowered unless there's strict action against the dishonest. The ultimate beneficiaries of these steps will be the poor. These steps will empower the honest,\" he said. Targeting the opposition, PM Modi claimed the people and the government were together on this decision while the opposition parties were isolated on the other side of the divide. \"There is a horizontal divide - on one side are the people of India and the government and on the other side are a group of political leaders,\" he said. The Prime Minister slammed the opposition for dragging the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) into politics over the note ban. \"Attacks on the party I belong to, our government, on me are understandable but why was the RBI dragged into this? Let us keep institutions above politics,\" he admonished. PM Modi said the demonetisation move has no parallels in the world as a decision of this magnitude was never taken in history.
