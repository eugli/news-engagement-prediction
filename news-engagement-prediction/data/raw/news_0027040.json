He said the spinoff would be a different show and that \"tone, pace, storytelling will be unique.\" (The spinoff will not be set in Northern California as Sons was.) \"I wanted to find a strong, unique Latino voice. Because I didn't think a white guy from Jersey should be writing about Latin culture and traditions. Elgin is that voice,\" Sutter said at the time. Olmos' credits include Miami Vice and Agents of SHIELD. He's repped by CAA.
