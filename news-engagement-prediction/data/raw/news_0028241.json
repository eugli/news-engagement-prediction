They were worth £2 million ($3.27 million Cdn). This 1777 edition of Isaac Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy was among the books stolen from the warehouse. (Kuehn Books) \n\"This was a big job,\" rare book dealer Alessandro Meda Riquier told CBC Radio As It Happens guest host Helen Mann. \"Police said that it took more than three hours to complete.\" \nMeda Riquier lost about $1.6 million worth of books in the heist. Among them were a 1569 edition of Dante's Divine Comedy and a second-edition copy of Copernicus's On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, \"the book that explained for the first time that the centre of the universe was not the Earth but the sun.\" This 1569 edition of Dante's Divine Comedy was one of the books stolen in the heist. (Meda Riquier Rare Books Ltd.) \n\"I lost many important books,\" Meda Riquier said. \nFortunately for Meda Riquier, the books were insured. \n\"But having the money back does not mean I will be able to find them again and purchase them again,\" he said. \nCollecting antique tomes is more than a hobby for Meda Riquier, \n\"This is my job,\" he said. \"So this will affect my job in the future for a long time.\" \nThe burglary has left rare book dealers distressed — but also baffled. Because the stolen books are so well-known, Meda Riquier said, they would be \"quite impossible\" to fence. \nOne source familiar with the case told the Guardian: \"There must be a collector behind it.\" \nAsked if he thinks he'll ever see his prized texts again, Meda Riquier told As It Happens : \"I don't really have great expectation.\" Alessandro Meda Riquier lost 'many important books' in the London heist.
