This comes from USA Today , which also has some concept art and photos from Comic-Con last year. Here are some highlights from the stills: (Image: Marvel Studios, USA Today) \nThis is Rocket and Groot looking through a hole they just blasted in someone/something.

If you’ve seen those trailers, you probably know that he’s excited because he’s going to kill everyone with a bomb. \nYou can see a few more images at USA Today , and Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 will be in theaters on May 5. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:52:12.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
