Leyson and Mitchelle L. Palaubsanon   Tension between Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña and Presidential Assistant for the Visayas Michael Dino over the leadership crisis in Barangay Ermita is worsening. \nYesterday, Dino said he will sue Osmeña if the mayor will not stop accusing him of meddling in the Ermita situation, particularly the appointment of a caretaker, following the suspension of the barangay's officials. \n\"The issue about Barangay Ermita is very local. PA Dino does not want to meddle into it. He already issued a statement that he does not want to recommend anyone in Barangay Ermita because it's the job of the DILG to handle the matter,\" said Dino's chief of staff and spokesperson Jonji Gonzales. \nOsmeña has said he will file a case for obstruction of justice against Dino. \n\"I am going to file a case in the Ombudsman against Michael Dino for obstruction of justice. Rupinta was given a preventive suspension and the purpose of preventive suspension is to prevent you from interfering in your investigation but by having Michael Dino to tell Rupinta who they want as your replacement is counter-productive and paves the way of obstructing your own investigation because you are now allowed to find your own replacement,\" Osmeña told reporters yesterday. \nOsmeña also said he will ask the Office of the Ombudsman-Visayas to also suspend Dino for allegedly interfering.   \nGonzales said Dino will file counter-charges if Osmeña gets on with his plan. \nHe said that Dino will not allow Osmeña to drag him into a \"nonsensical\" matter. \nGonzales said Osmeña needs to understand that only the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and the Office of the President have the authority to appoint a caretaker for Ermita. \nGonzales pointed out that Dino even issued a statement earlier that he does not want to make any recommendation. \n\"How many times do I need to say that I do not want to recommend? I repeat, I do not want to recommend. Allow the DILG to do its job,\" Dino said earlier. \n\"Mokiha gyud si Dino once the case of Osmeña against him will be dismissed by the Office of the Ombudsman of which we are sure nga i-dismiss ra na sa Ombudsman… wa ra gyud na nagtingog-tingog si Dino. Pero karon, sobra na kaayo si Osmeña. It's about time nga ikiha na gyud na siya,\" Gonzales said. \n\"The good mayor is exposing his ignorance by way of playing around the legal gobbledygook and to make it appear before his constituency that he is in the right sense. But plainly, there's no obstruction of justice to speak of because the assistant of the President is just monitoring the situation in Barangay Ermita to make sure that basic services shall not be sacrificed in the event that temporary vacancy occurs,\" he added. \nIn a separate interview, Rupinta told The FREEMAN that Dino never lifted his finger on the situation in the barangay. \n\"Nahibong ta kay wala man nangayo og recommendations nako si Dino, wala siya nanghilabot, wala sad ko nag-endorse og pangalan ngadto niya. Usa pa sad, wa ko kibaw asa na siya pangitaon,\" Rupinta said. Roots \nThe \"fight\" between Dino and Osmeña can be traced as far back as 2006 when the city government did not issue a development permit to Fifth Avenue Property Development Corporation, the developer of the 3.3 hectare Ciudad project in Barangay Banilad reportedly due to the absence of an Environmental Compliance Certificate. \nOsmeña was mayor while Dino was executive vice president and chief executive officer of FAPDC at that time. \n\"Actually, wa man gyud nangaway si Dino ni Tomas at that time. Napagan ra siya sa away ni Tomas og Gwen (former governor Gwendolyn Garcia),\" Gonzales said. \nThe Ciudad project was a Joint Venture between the Provincial Government and FAPDC but it not materialize. \n\"Niabot to ang time nga gikiha ni Tomas ang DENR ug si Dino about the said project,\" Gonzales said. \nDino then decided not to pursue with the project and stayed away from the limelight until his appointment as presidential assistant when Duterte won as President last year. \nOsmeña had supported Liberal Party standard bearer Mar Roxas in the 2016 polls. On the ready \nMeanwhile, Osmeña said he is ready to appoint Atty. Winifredo Orcullo, City Market Administrator, as acting barangay captain of Ermita together with SPO1 Adonis Dumpit if DILG cannot appoint anyone by Monday.
