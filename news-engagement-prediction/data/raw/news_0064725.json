Most Popular By Mike Botticello Feb 22, 2017 All-Star weekend is the NBA's crown jewel on the basketball calendar, a celebration of the game, its players, and its future. And while athletes, companies, and everyone else all strive to make a big impression during the event, this year, Jordan Brand stood out from the rest on hand in New Orleans. Rather than the standard \"party, DJ, and celebrity\" routine, Jordan established itself in the community. Other brands pulled out all the stops to push cell phones and soft drinks, but Jordan had something much more powerful to offer: an icon.

In signature Jordan fashion, the space highlighted the artwork, music, and culture of the true New Orleans: Local artists and musicians were on hand to both inspire and entertain visitors. Most Popular Of course there was also footwear. But before sneakerheads got to new releases and sought-after restocks, they were treated to a venue that was equal parts museum, creative studio, and artist showcase. Distressed brick walls were papered with portraits of Jordan family stars Kwahi Leonard, Kemba Walker, Jimmy Butler, and Russell Westbrook. Jordan Brand Centrally located hung a massive shot of a skinny freshman: Michael Jordan putting up the game-winning jumper in the 1982 NCAA title game in New Orleans—MJ's lasting connection to New Orleans, the start of his legacy. The central theme: \"Gotta Shine.\" Fitting for a city that lives to entertain.

In the back corner, a customization lab—equipped with printing presses and logo books, with the Jordan/NOLA-exclusive images giving a nod to jazz, voodoo, and basketball—for designing souvenir shirts commemorating the weekend in the Big Easy. In the other corner, a seemingly endless stream of Jordanheads flocked to snag the crisp, iridescent All-Star Jordan 1s, 6s, and 31s. The weekend also saw the release of coveted versions of the \"72-10\" 11s, \"Motorsport\" 4s (celebrated by a not-to-miss Jordan motorsport bike), and an extremely limited release of gold 31s, exclusive to the 221 Chartres pop-up. With a line stretched down the block, those who put in time to get inside were not disappointed. On Thursday, the opening night crowd jammed when Jeezy took the stage and ran through his arsenal of hits, new and old. Throughout the weekend, local artists were on hand on to create Jordan-themed, New Orleans-infused work, and local musicians performed, giving it a true French Quarter feel. On Saturday, a select group of local collectors were invited to an exclusive showcase—and gifted with All-Star editions just in cased they missed out on the weekend's releases. Jordan Brand Equally as impressive as the pop-up space was what the Jordan Brand put together some fifteen minutes north of the French Quarter at Saint Augustine High School. In a year that the NBA moved All-Star weekend from Charolette in protest of North Carolina's HB2 bill, the spotlight on awareness could not be brighter. Jordan sought not only to be involved with the community, but to be immersed in it. Jordan Brand The Jordan Brand Invitational transformed the school as players were given an all-star experience of their own. Two games on Thursday night featured local schools Crescent City and host Saint Augustine, then a matchup of powerhouses: Scotlandville and Oak Hill Academy. The gym literally rocked with the marching band playing all night on an inside stage. Projector screens hung from the ceiling replaying the action on the court below. Add Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, and Frank Kaminsky to the list of attendees, and students had game experience unlike any other. On Saturday, the agenda pivoted to an event with a more lasting goal: change. Students and community leaders joined New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu, Jordan Brand president Larry Miller, and brand athletes Walker, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Greg Monroe, and Carmelo Anthony to dig into social issues and how to bring about change. Topics of gun violence and racial equality were met with discussions on leadership, unity, and action. Then the players, execs, and students broke into focus groups, facilitated by the local leaders, transitioning the conversation to sharing perspectives, ideas, and goals. Meanwhile, local artists sketched out imagery of these themes to create artwork that will eventually become a series of murals painted throughout the city. Jordan Brand The feeling was a far cry from the glitz of the weekend, in the best way possible. A part of the Wings for the Future initiative, it was about doing real work and affecting real change in the community. New Orleans is a worthy setting: Consistently, the stories shared by the group highlighted the need for resources that are otherwise lacking. All-Star Weekend was the jumping-off point, but this is a matter of connecting to the culture at large. So, as the city was in full swing with NBA and Mardi Gras festivities alike, Jordan delivered both style and substance. All points were connected, and the future was illuminated. From the swagger of the pop-up to the exuberance of high-school hoops and the urgency of the community efforts, All-Star Weekend shined indeed.
