He had hinted it was from a network that President Trump is “always targeting.” \nHe did an interview with––of all places––CNN, where he provided some detail to Brian Stelter : \nHe said “part one” would be published Thursday at about 10 a.m. ET. “This is all legally recorded information,” he said, declining to be more specific… \nAsked why CNN is one of his targets, he said, “My audience, the American people, are deeply upset at the media.” He cited President Trump’s critiques of “fake news.” \n“We think our media needs to be held to account, and CNN is kind of the leader of that. CNN has a very important role as an arbiter of news,” he said. \nBeyond just CNN, “the media is a huge target of mine right now,” O’Keefe said. \nAt one point O’Keefe was confronted about the criticisms he’s received over his past videos: \nGiven his track record, many consider O’Keefe discredited, and not a serious journalist. \nIn the phone interview on Wednesday, he said that characterization is “very false and very inappropriate.” \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:23:26.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
