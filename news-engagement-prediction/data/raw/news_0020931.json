They would likely ask for around £15 million for anyone interested in Hart's services. \nA move back to the Premier League is extremely important for Hart's international future as it would allow England boss Gareth Southgate to keep a closer eye on him,. \nArsenal are also set to assess another goalkeeper's situation in the summer. \nWhen the summer rolls around, Arsenal will make a decision about to decide whether selling Wojciech Szczesny or giving him a new contract is the best option. \nThe Polish international, who had some very dodgy pictures posted on his Instagram after appearing to be hacked last night , has been on loan at Roma for the past two seasons.
