India, the reigning World No. 1 Test team, take on Australia, ranked No. 2. A storied rivalry is set to resume to bring the curtains on India's grand domestic season that began against New Zealand. And what better way than to take on arguably their greatest rivals in the longest format. \nOver the past, India-Australia encounters have provided entertainment like few other match-ups. We take you down the memory lane with an interactive map where every Test match Australia has played over the last 30 years -- starting with the tied Test in 1986. \nAll you have to do is click on any venue in the map below and voila -- a brief summary of every Test played in that venue will pop-up.
