Palaniswami in the Assembly, DMK leader M.K. Stalin’s counsel Shanmugasundaram on Tuesday alleged in the Madras High Court that the Speaker and Assembly Secretary are attempting to tamper with the records of the proceedings of February 18 in the House. \nThe senior counsel urged the First Bench of Acting Chief Justice Huluvadi G. Ramesh and Justice R. Mahadevan to urgently hear the Public Interest Litigation Petition filed by Mr. Stalin. \nWhen the Bench commenced its proceedings, Mr Shanmugasundaram pointed out that the court had on Monday assured to hear the PIL on Tuesday but unfortunately the plea was not in the cause list. He then urged the court to take up the PIL at least after lunch considering the fact that they have specific information about the attempts being made to tamper the Assembly records. \nConsidering his contention, the Bench assured him that the PIL would be heard as the first item on Wednesday morning, since the court is scheduled to rise early for a full court reference for former Chief Justice of India Altamas Kabir who passed away on Sunday. \nIn his PIL, Mr. Stalin prayed the court to declare the decision of the Assembly Speaker in accepting the vote of confidence as illegal, null and void. \nThe Leader of the Opposition also prayed the court to direct the Speaker of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly to conduct fresh secret ballot on the confidence motion moved by the Chief Minister, without evicting the MLAs of any legislative party, and under the observation of the Monitoring Committee comprising the Secretary of Tamil Nadu Governor, Chief Secretary, and an official in the rank of Chief Electoral Officer from the Election Commission of India. \n“There was total mala fide and arbitrary exercise of power by the Speaker of the Assembly. The members of the legislature belonging to the AIADMK party were illegally detained against their will, brought in vehicles arranged by the supporters of the Chief Minister in order to vote in his favour. As this was against the accepted democratic principles and against the guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India even for voting in the general elections, I prayed the Speaker, not to allow open voting and order for either secret ballot, or to adjourn the motion after few days in order to free the MLAs from captivity to exercise their vote freely without any undue influence,” Mr. Stalin said. \nBut to the contrary, the Speaker ordered “illegal” eviction of all the MLAs of DMK in “with highhanded police force, thereby preventing DMK MLAs from exercising their franchise on the floor of the Assembly,” Mr. Stalin alleged.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:30:01.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
