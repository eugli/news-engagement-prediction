At the same time, we would also like to remind all parties to not act in a prejudicial manner against all reporters from the media in question,” it said. \nGeramm also urged the two dailies’ editorial teams to observe the principles of ethical journalism in their daily operations, “to avoid further erosion of their credibility in this era of borderless information.” \nGeramm is a loose coalition of journalists, media activists and representatives who fight for freedom of the press and its practitioners. \n“Geramm stresses our stand as a non-partisan movement that works together with all who share the same aim of taking Malaysian journalism to a higher level, for the benefit of all,” it said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:40:21.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
