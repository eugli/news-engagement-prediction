By Suzy Strutner \nAmerican Sign Language is the main method of communication for Americans who are deaf or hearing impaired. It’s taught in some high schools and universities , but if you’re beyond those years, there’s still hope for learning ― and a simple one at that. \nGiphy has added more than 2,000 instructional sign language GIFs to its library, Mashable reports. The clips , which are free to access, demonstrate signs for everything from common sayings and expressions to cooking terms, clothing items and travel phrases. \nGiphy cut the GIFs from episodes of Sign With Robert , an instructional video series whose host Robert DeMayo has been deaf since birth. His GIFs repeat the signs in an endless loop that’s easy to study, along with facial expressions that many may not realize are a key part of ASL .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:56:36.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
