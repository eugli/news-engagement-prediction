But in the months prior to his departure, some board members had raised serious questions about expenditures related to the bond, which voters approved in November 2014. Administrative changes \nThe bond was to provide updates to every facility, with construction through 2020. GISD itemized projects for each of its facilities as the bond was being advertised to voters. But the ballot wording of \"$455.5 million for the construction, renovation, acquisition and equipment of school buildings\" gives the district broad authorization in spending the approved funds. \nThe changes were directed by the administration, Acosta said, and not taken to the board for approval. Nor were they part of the monthly bond updates Acosta and GISD's facilities department gave at the board's monthly meetings. Linda Griffin, Garland ISD board president \nBoard president Linda Griffin insisted at the meeting that all future changes in the bond program be approved by the board. \n\"Each recommendation will require an action item to the board,\" she said. \"These are tough decisions that we're going to have to make. We need to take our time and make sure we can live with the decisions.\" \nRepresenting Jacobs, the company hired by GISD to oversee the projects, Acosta said about $21.7 million of additional work came from an administrative request to establish a standard of equality for the middle school and high school fine arts facility upgrades. \nThe fine arts were to be upgraded as part of the bond. But to make the upgrades of equal standards, some campuses needed thousands more square feet of additions than originally planned, which hiked the price. \nSome $3.4 million of other upgrades were ordered for applied learning education rooms and nurse's clinics at campuses, Acosta said. Those were not in the original list of bond projects. \nAcosta also said $10.4 million in planned fixes to 13 GISD facilities other than campuses -- administrative and special services buildings, two stadiums and the Culwell Center -- were taken off the bond project list by the administration. \nAcosta also said that in November 2015, Jacobs was instructed by the administration to reduce the contingency fund for the program from 10 percent to 3 percent. That made it appear more money was available for projects, but left less margin for cost overruns than Jacobs typically recommends. Recommendations Garland ISD interim Superintendent Deborah Cron. Courtesy/Garland ISD \nInterim Superintendent Deborah Cron called Monday's special meeting to get everyone back on the same page on the bond and refocused on the program's future. \n\"The main thing we need to keep in perspective as we try to go forward tonight is where are we now,\" trustee Rick Lambert said. \"Where are we on the projects and will we or will we not be able to get them all done?\" \nDealing with the fiscal concerns now likely saved future headaches for district officials. Though the bond was headed off track, approximately $267 million remains in the program and many projects have yet to be bid. \nThe most controversial of the remaining projects is a natatorium . Advertised to voters at $20 million, the swimming facility was delayed to the end of the bond because estimates had risen to as high as $32 million. \nAcosta said a natatorium could be built at $20 million as part of a bond program where all items were addressed.. It would, however, be a 42,000 square-foot pool at the district's Johnson Stadium, with far reduced seating and other amenities than the previously sought 59,000 square-foot pool along the Bush Turnpike. \nAnother recommendation is to revert to original plans for fine arts additions at middle schools and high schools that have not yet been bid. \nAcosta listed several other possible cutbacks ranging from installing rooftop air conditioner units to removing the applied learning environment and nurse clinic upgrades from the bond measure. \nHe said the result of all measures would be a bond program that not only restored the contingency cushion to 10 percent, but would come in $1.8 million under the $455 million approved by voters.
