The 16-year-old boys, who were arrested over the weekend, are charged with one count each of first-degree felony attempted aggravated murder and aggravated robbery and four counts each of second-degree felony obstructing justice.\nThe two teen suspects allegedly lured their victim to a dry canal bed in Smithfield, Utah, under the guise of selling her a knife, according to charging documents obtained by PEOPLE.\nThe county attorney said he plans to try them both as adults, but such a motion has not yet been approved by a judge. A court official says information about the suspects’ attorneys and pleas was not available Wednesday because they’re minors. They remain in custody.\nPEOPLE is not identifying the suspects while they are being tried as juveniles.\nAuthorities say the victim, a ninth-grade girl, was found semi-conscious in the canal, about 90 miles north of Salt Lake City, on Friday. She had been reported missing the previous evening after she didn’t arrive home from school, and she was hospitalized soon after being found.\nFamily spokesman Jill Parker tells PEOPLE the victim remains in critical condition in a medically-induced coma.\n“She is in the fight of her life right now,” Parker told the Salt Lake City Tribune .\n• Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

He eventually confessed, authorities claim.\nWhen interviewed by police, that same teen allegedly said that after he shot the victim at close range, he stole her cellphone and iPod from her pocket. He allegedly claimed the other teen stole $55 from the victim’s purse and forcibly removed her backpack from her body.\nAfter they robbed her, the duo allegedly tossed the victim’s backpack in a Dumpster in a city park and destroyed her electronics, according to the charging documents.\nGreed was the reason they stole the items, the first suspect allegedly told police in his confession. He provided police with “a written apology to family in which he states ‘I am so so so sorry,’ ” the documents claim.\n• Pick up PEOPLE’s special edition True Crime Stories: Cases That Shocked America , on sale now , for the latest on Casey Anthony, JonBenét Ramsey and more.\nThe teen allegedly told police that after the shooting, he hid the gun under his brother’s mattress and gave the bullet casing to his accomplice as a “memento,” according to the documents. Police found the casing on the teen’s bedroom windowsill.\nThe second teen was also interviewed by police and initially denied any involvement in the shooting, according to the documents. He later told police he had met his friend at the canal but claimed the friend was with a girl he didn’t know.\nHe said the girl asked for a ride home and when she turned around to walk away, his friend allegedly pulled out a gun and shot her in the head — which scared him. His interview ended after he asked for an attorney.\nCache County Attorney James Swink told reporters the crime’s violence was unusual, according to the Associated Press.\n“I haven’t seen anything like this case in the 18 years I’ve worked ,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:23:58.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
