She joined the Inquirer in 2000. More by Melanie Burney Arrow icon \nThere was a time when Bria “Swish” Young would draw a reprimand from her college coach with her fancy moves on the basketball court: dribbling through her legs and behind her back. \nThese days her dazzling skills and showmanship win applause when she takes the court to entertain crowds as a member of the legendary Harlem Globetrotters. \nYoung, 23, who honed her gamesmanship growing up in Philadelphia, returns home next month to make her debut at the Wells Fargo Center as a Globetrotter. \nIt is a dream come true for the 5’ foot 6 guard who was named in December to the Trotters rookie class. She is the 14th female to join the exhibition team in its 91-year history. \n“This was a once in a lifetime opportunity,” Young said in a recent telephone interview while traveling with the team in Rochester, N.Y. “There was no way I could turn it down.” \nShe began playing when she was about 7 years old, after watching her father and uncle play street basketball in the city. She modeled her style after former 76ers star and NBA Hall of Famer Allen Iverson. \nAfter graduating from Philadelphia’s Prep Charter in 2011, Young enrolled in St. Francis University near Pittsburgh, fulfilling her dream to play at a Division I school. \nBut she quickly became homesick. She transferred to Philadelphia University, a Division II school, where her mother, Lisa, worked in the Human Resources Department. \nCoach Tom Shirley, who had followed her career in the city, welcomed her to the Rams. He wasn’t too impressed, however, with her fancy style of play. \n“Do you think you’re a Globetrotter or what? Stop with all the crap,” Shirley laughingly recalled telling his future star player. \nYoung later became a starting point guard at Philadelphia University her junior year. She scored 1,067 career points and was named the Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference Player of the year in 2016. The team won the CACC championship her senior year. \n“She was a great kid, a pleasure to coach,” Shirley said. \nYoung graduated last May with a bachelor’s in Psychology and hoped to become a professional basketball player. She was invited last summer to attend a tryout for the Globetrotters in Atlantic City. \nThe Globetrotters host about five tryouts a year, inviting about 10 players to each tryout, a team official says. A team of scouts and coaches decides who to add to the elite squad. \nTo prepare for the tryout, Young practiced sliding on the court while dribbling – a signature move and fan pleaser. She ended up with floor burns on her legs, but improved, she said. \n“Going into the trials I didn’t know what to expect,” she said. \nAt the tryout \nShe was a member of a six-member rookie class that was chosen and debuted with the team when it began its 2017 World tour on Dec. 26. Also on the team is Latif “Jet” \nAs an aspiring player, Young said she looked up to fellow Trotter Fatima “TNT” \n“I wanted to be like her,” \n\"I’ve always had a lot of respect for her. She definitely embodies everything we’ \nBoth women said they want to be role models for girls and hope they will be encouraged by their example in a male dominated sports. There are 27 men on the Trotters. \n\"It’s always a little bit of an uphill climb for women. \nYoung said she hopes young girls will be inspired by her selection to the team that has been synonymous with the whistle “Sweet Georgia Brown.” \n“Now young girls have another outlet dream. It’s someone they can look up to,” \nThe all-black Globetrotters were founded in 1926, combining athleticism with theater and comedy. They are credited with popularizing the slam dunk and fast break and helping break down racial barriers that allowed black players to enter the NBA. In 1950, Globetrotter Nathaniel “Sweetwater” \nYoung said she has enjoyed being on the team, despite grueling practice and game schedules. In her spare time, she practices her 4-point shot, added last year to the Globetrotters’ \nThe 4-point line is located 30 feet from the basket, 6 feet, 3 inches beyond the current 3-point line in the NBA. \n“It’s almost like shooting from half court,” Young said. “That’s one of the trick shots I absolutely love to share.” \nShe’s expecting a huge crowd that will include her parents and lots of local fans when the Globetrotters appear at the Wells Fargo on March 4-5. She undoubtedly will live up to her nickname –“Swish.” \n“It’s a great job. It’s truly a blessing,” Young said. “This is so much a dream come true.” Published: February 20, 2017 — 12:12 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.
