I know this, because when I spoke to them on the phone — when they couldn't see me — they would say things like, 'We really love your resume, please come in,' But as soon as they see me, the tone changes.\n\"It has the ability to affect someone's livelihood.\"\n'They're not seeing me as a person'\nLevitsky has struggled with her weight since childhood. She now works for the Canadian Obesity Network , an association made up of health-care professionals, researchers, policy makers and people with an interest in obesity.\nFor years, she felt shame about her body and slowly grew frustrated with the way obese people were vilified and humiliated.\nNow she wants to reclaim the word \"fat,\" and has become the public face of a national campaign, the Weight of Living, which examines the everyday discriminations obese people face.\n\"It's hard to describe, because there is never been a point in my life where I've been an ideal body weight,\" she said. \"I've been a fat kid my whole life.\n\"It's having to defend yourself over and over again. What I eat is none of your business. What I do for exercise is none of your business. But unfortunately, when you're overweight, people make it their business.\n\"And that's unfortunate, because they're not seeing me as a person.\"\n'This is not something that will be ignored'\nIf legislation is changed, Alberta would be among the first jurisdictions in the country to include appearance-based discrimination under its human rights laws.\nManitoba is currently considering legislation. Bill 207 was introduced there last October. A similar movement is going on in Ontario, but the group there is currently trying to win government support.\nLevitsky's online petition has 500 signatures. She hopes to have close to 10,000 before she presents the document to the justice minister for consideration.\n\"I'm confident, because I plan on keeping in touch with them and making it known that this is not something that will be ignored,\" she said. \"This is affecting people's lives, whether they realize it or not.\"\nWith files from Tanara Mclean", "external_links": ["https://www.change.org/p/alberta-human-rights-commission-end-sizeism-in-alberta-sizeismsucks", "http://www.obesitynetwork.ca/"], "published": "2017-02-23T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:38:16.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
