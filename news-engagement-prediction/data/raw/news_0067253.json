They were busy searching the men when they were ambushed by a second group of armed men. \nA shootout ensued and an officer was shot in the chest. In the chaos, two of the four men managed to escape with the second group, according to Mamonyane. \nThe injured officer was airlifted to Milpark Hospital by police helicopter. \n“The officer was wearing a [bulletproof] vest but the impact of the bullet was still enough to severely injure the left side of his chest,” said Mamonyane. \nJMPD officers recovered approximately R60 million worth of cellphones. \n- TimesLIVE Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
