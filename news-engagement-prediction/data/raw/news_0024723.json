Go out and play in the snow! The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has just ruled 3-0 against reinstating President Trump’s travel ban . I know that you, like me, wished you had studied constitutional law when you listened to the audio of the legal arguments Wednesday night. But even as I strained to understand, it did seem promising. The lawyer for the justice department was clearly not doing that well—but then again, maybe wishful thinking was clouding my judgment? The 27-page decision was just released , so I haven’t seen it (nor do I have an attorney handy to walk me through it), but apparently, according to my friends at MSNBC (they seem like friends, I watch them all day long) the decision goes a lot further than it had to, in detailing the illegality of the ban, and in stating that presidential power is not unlimited. The pundits are saying that the White House would do better to craft a new executive order, rather than bring this one to the Supreme Court—but even as I write this the president has just tweeted “See You In Court.” Well, ok buddy. For now, after just about the three most terrifying, craziest weeks in American political history, let’s just pop the champagne and celebrate.
