Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nIf you never quite got around to canceling that HBO subscription you started in 1984, maybe you’ve flipped past an episode of “Girls” and could do us all a favor and explain the fuss around Lena Dunham. \nHillary Clinton certainly thought Dunham, who had appeared in ads comparing casting one’s first vote for Obama to losing one’s virginity , could drum up support from new voters pulling that lever for the first time in 2016. \nEveryone knows how that turned out, although in Dunham’s newsletter, Virginia Heffernan explained that losing only elevated Clinton to a level somewhere above president : “She is an idea, a world-historical heroine, light itself.” \nIt’s no surprise, then, that according to Entertainment Weekly , Dunham recently told Howard Stern that the “soul-crushing pain and devastation and hopelessness” that came from Clinton’s defeat was responsible for her weight loss — something that shouldn’t be hard to fact check, since she can’t seem to stop appearing naked , even when pitching Obamacare. Lena Dunham revealed that she has none other than Donald Trump to thank for her weight loss. https://t.co/PmbtVejB8v \n— Entertainment Weekly (@EW) February 6, 2017 \n“Donald Trump became president and I stopped being able to eat food,” she told Stern. Followers of EW, however, are finding something else hard to stomach. @EW @people Can we hear actual entertainment news for once instead of just celebs complaining about Trump? It's getting old. \n— Allison Crow (@Allison_P_Crow) February 6, 2017 @EW anything ridiculous sounding about Donald trump is in the news. Blaming the election for losing weight? Get it together Lena. \n— Hendon❤️Savoie (@JessSavoie88) February 6, 2017 @EW @people Come on EW can't U find anything but celebrity Trump stories? Are U that hard up for news.Tired of it all. \n— Dolly Davis (@d29681) February 6, 2017 @EW @people . Good lord…this is entertainment news??? She and you need to get a life and move on…at least for 4 years! \n— Mona Maloney (@vegasgal13) February 6, 2017 @EW @people OMG totally pathetic ! I thought she was moving to Canada?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T01:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:56:52.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
