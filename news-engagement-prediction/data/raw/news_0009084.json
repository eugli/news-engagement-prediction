Trudeau government ponder ‘ambiguous’ results of electoral reform survey \n“We are committed to ensuring that 2015 will be the last federal election conducted under the first-past-the-post voting system,” the Liberal platform document told voters. \nThe platform was open-ended about what form reform might take, naming ranked ballots, proportional representation, mandatory voting, and online voting as possibilities. \nOn Wednesday, however, a mandate letter written by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for newly appointed Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould made it clear that electoral reform – once top of mind for the Liberal government – is no longer on the agenda. \n“Changing the electoral system will not be in your mandate,” Trudeau wrote in the letter, released Wednesday. \n“A clear preference for a new electoral system, let alone a consensus, has not emerged,” Trudeau wrote. “Furthermore, without a clear preference or a clear question, a referendum would not be in Canada’s interest.” \nThe NDP’s Nathan Cullen described the move as “perhaps the most cynical display of self-serving politics.” \nThe largest number of signers said they were from Ontario, with strong participation from Alberta and B.C. \nProportionate to population, Alberta and B.C. had the highest participation rates. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:38:37.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
