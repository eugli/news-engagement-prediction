That said, most Avengers can't hold a candle to the sheer power that the Scarlet Witch commands. \nThat power and unpredictability have made her a crowd favorite for a long time, but the character reached a whole new audience when she debuted in Avengers: Age of Ultron and joined the team in Captain America: Civil War . Whether you're a fan of her original incarnation in the books or this new version seen in the films, you're going to love this Scarlet Witch cosplay from Florencia Sofen. \nScarlet's costume in the movies is a bit more streamlined than her comic origins, but it perfectly fits the character that graces the screen. These photos from Sofen and photographer Rafael 'Fali' Ruiz Davila are stunning, with a myriad of magical effects that could be right out of the film. In fact, Sofen dawns a wig that makes a quick double take necessary, as she's a dead ringer for Elizabeth Olsen. \nSome fans just aren't in love with the modern take, which is perfectly fine since Sofen and photographer Jonathan Duran have you covered there as well. Their photoshoot features the classic Scarlet Witch, complete with ring belt, long cape, headband, and all the hex effects you could ever want. \nYou can view the whole set in the gallery, but there is plenty more to see on their respective channels. \nFlorencia Sofen Cosplays work can be found on her Deviant Art , Facebook , and Patreon pages, and includes iconic heroes like Power Girl, Thor, Spider-Woman , Harley Quinn , and more. \nJonathan Duran's work can be found on Deviant Art , and you can find Rafael \"Fali\" Ruiz-Davila's work on Facebook . The modern costume can be found on ManyCosplay , while the wig can be found on Funidelia . \nScarlet Witch will next be seen in the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War , which currently holds a 4.32 out of 5 on ComicBook.com's anticipation rankings , but you can view the entire Marvel film release calendar below. \nNext up for Marvel is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 on May 5, 2017. Spider-Man: Homecoming lands on July 7, 2017, followed by Thor: Ragnarok on November 3, 2017. After that Black Panther debuts on February 16, 2018, while Avengers: Infinity War hits theaters on May 4, 2018. Ant-Man and the Wasp is slated for July 6, 2018, followed by Captain Marvel on March 8, 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:30:10.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
