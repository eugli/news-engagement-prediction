Many of those leagues will continue, but only for a few more weeks.\n'Really big disappointment' Jacob Nobbe started his Grade 12 hockey season playing for the Citadel High Phoenix, but when work-to-rule started in early December, his final season was put on hold.\nNow he's learned he won't get the chance to play for a high school title.\nOn Thursday, Nobbe and some of his teammates delivered a letter to their school principal asking him to talk with the NSSAF to try and get provincials reinstated.\n\"It's just a really big disappointment because we wanted to compete for the provincial championship,\" said Nobbe. \"It's disappointing they cancel it, for really no reason.\"\nNobbe and the rest of his teammates at Citadel are hoping there is a change and the provincials, which were set to be played in Glace Bay, can be reinstated.\nAt least one other boys' high school team, the Auburn Drive High School Eagles, have approached their principal with a similar request.\nTeachers will decide what extra work to do Earlier this week, Nova Scotia's Liberal government passed legislation imposing a new contract on 9,300 teachers. Many of those teachers are also high school coaches and the Nova Scotia Teachers Union has said individual teachers can decide how involved to get in extracurricular activities.\nThat puts the coaching of school spring sports teams like rugby, badminton, softball and track-and-field, in a grey area.\n\"We'll have to wait and see,\" said Gallant, the head of the NSSAF. \"We've always had a great relationship with teachers in our schools and I hope that will continue.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:48:54.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
