Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nThe antifascist movement that has contributed this week to protests, assaults, and vandalism outside College Republican-sponsored events at UC Berkeley and NYU is at least giving James O’Keefe of Project Veritas some giggles. \nAs reported by Alex Pfeiffer in the Daily Caller , the DC Antifascist Coalition had planned to reveal “shocking new information” about filmmaker James O’Keefe at the National Press Club — the same building that DisruptJ20 allegedly had targeted for a stink bombing during the post-inauguration DeploraBall, at least until undercover videos from Project Veritas revealed that and other plans. \nThe group instead moved its presentation from a conference room to the building’s food court; even there, however, the antifascists were pressured by a security guard to buy some food or get out. The show went on, and Daryle Lamont Jenkins, executive director of the One People’s Project, reportedly fired up his iPad to show a photo of O’Keefe at a conference which included white nationalist Jared Taylor. \nFlipping the iPad around, though, caused it to display thumbnails of Jenkins’ entire photo library, including stills from several porn videos. So @OnePeoplesProj and @DLamontJenkins , Lauren Windsor, you have no idea how much joy you unintentionally bring into my life. #gotcha pic.twitter.com/Ajzqh6kK1q \n— James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) February 3, 2017 \nMaybe we’ll let O’Keefe tell it.
