I watched it against Ronald Reagan, I’ve watched it against so many other people. And they always like pulling out the race card.” \nTrump was the target of several jokes, allusions, and sincere criticisms during Sunday night’s Oscars, with host Jimmy Kimmel leading the charge. \n“This is being watched live by millions of people in 225 countries that now hate us,” Kimmel said in his opening monologue. He added, “I want to say thank you to President Trump. Remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist? … It’s gone, thanks to him.” \nPresenters and Oscar winners including Gael Garcia Bernal, Orlando von Einsiedel, Barry Jenkins, Tarell Alvin McCraney, Rich Moore, and Asghar Farhadi (by proxy) also made statements decrying Trump’s policies, either explicitly or implicitly. \nIn the Fox & Friends interview, Trump also spoke about his decision not to attend the White House Correspondents Dinner this year. Repeating an unsubstantiated claim that the news media fabricates stories about him, he said, “a lot of the stories are made up. I believe a lot of the stories are pure fiction.” He added, “I just thought it would be better if I didn’t do the dinner. That doesn’t mean I’m not going to do it next year.” \nFox & Friends airs weekdays at 6 a.m. ET on Fox News Channel.
