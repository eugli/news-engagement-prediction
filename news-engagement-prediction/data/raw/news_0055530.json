What I mean is, when Steve Jobs revealed the iTunes Movie Store, he explained that new releases would have the $14.99 price tag whereas the Library Titles would have a $9.99 price tag. This works correctly for other movies on iTunes, but for some reason, Pixar movies (most of which are NOT new releases) all carry the $14.99 price tag. Now, whether this has to do with the fact that Steve Jobs was the CEO of Pixar for several years (and therefore sees it fit to charge the top dollar for these very well done movies) or not, I say that they should not receive such special treatment since these movies contain NO special features, or even a high quality picture. I am willing to pay $9.99 for these digital copies of these very well done movies, and I really do understand all the hard work it takes to make a full 3D motion picture, but I really cannot see paying what will be an extra $35-$40 when I go and buy all the Pixar movies on iTunes. Please Apple, lower the cost of the older Pixar movies to their appropriate $9.99 price, and I will buy every Pixar movie that is on the iTunes store. Thanks in advance. Can't get enough! by J.Naeve I'm just a big kid, I grew up on the classic cartoons (Bugs, Tom & Jerry, etc.) and apparently the folks at Pixar did too. Everytime this comes on I have to watch it. I must have seen this at least 11 or 12 times and just absolutely laugh 'till I hurt. One of the best parts is when \"Dash\" learns he can run on water, man I'm laughing now just thinking about it and then of course the little snippits of the kid on the tricycle - man this is great. This one and Monster's Inc are my two absolute favorites of all time! GREAT WORK FOLKS! Fun for the whole family... no, really. by easymac It's clich√© to say it these days, I realize, but this movie really is entertaining for people of all ages. I myself am a college student and would have to say this is one of my favorite movies, even though it is a \"kid's movie.\" My 6 year old cousin loved it, as well as most of my friends and even my parents! You can read the plot summary in the iTunes review, so I'll keep this to what I like about the movie. The humor is really top-knotch. The approach to the concept of super-heroes is unique and a lot of fun. The Incredibles has adventure, stunning visuals, great action, wit, and lots of excitement, while never being too scary or intense for the kids. Fun really is the key word in describing this movie. Definitely check it out. Viewers Also Bought", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:09:54.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
