British man Dave Taylor. Picture: AAP \nInstead, the prosecutor submitted they should be convicted of fatal assault in company, which carries a maximum of 12 years. \nIt's alleged the couple had been holidaying in Bali when they realised Connor's purse had gone missing, so Taylor confronted Mr Sudarsa but did not get the response from the police officer he was hoping for. \nReferring to a psychological evaluation of Taylor made after his arrest on August 19, the prosecutor said: \"Since there's no help, (he) felt like he was being treated as suspect and the influence of liquor, it made the subject emotional and overwhelmed. Connor was quickly escorted from the court to the holding cells.
