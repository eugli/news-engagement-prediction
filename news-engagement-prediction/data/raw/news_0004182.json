Security Council scheduled urgent consultations Tuesday on an Iranian ballistic missile test at the request of the United States. \nThe U.S. Mission to the United Nations said it wanted the U.N.’s most powerful body to discuss Sunday’s launch of a medium-range missile. \nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said earlier that he did not know the “exact nature” of the test and expected to have more information later.

The official had no other details, including the type of missile. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. \nWATCH: Nikki Haley calls suspected Iran missile launch ‘unacceptable’ \nIran is the subject of a United Nations Security Council resolution prohibiting tests of ballistic missiles designed to deliver a nuclear warhead. As part of the 2015 nuclear deal, the U.N. ban was prolonged by eight years, although Iran has flaunted the restriction. \nState Department spokesman Mark Toner said the U.S. was looking into whether the ballistic missile test violates the U.S. Security Council resolution. \n“When actions are taken that violate or are inconsistent with the resolution, we will act to hold Iran accountable and urge other countries to do so as well,” Toner said. \nSen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, condemned Iran for the missile test. \n“No longer will Iran be given a pass for its repeated ballistic missile violations, continued support of terrorism, human rights abuses and other hostile activities that threaten international peace and security,” Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, said in a written statement. \nIn this photo obtained from the Iranian Fars News Agency, a Qadr H long-range ballistic surface-to-surface missile is fired by Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guard, during a maneuver, in an undisclosed location in Iran, Wednesday, March 9, 2016.

Video footage shown on the rebels’ al-Masirah television on Monday shows a warship being hit and a fire on board starting as a man not shown in the video shouts the rebels’ trademark chant of “Allahu akbar (God is greatest), death to America, death to Israel, a curse on the Jews and victory for Islam.” \nThe media arm of the Shiite rebels, also known as the Houthis, said the vessel was believed to belong to the Saudi Arabian navy. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:02:21.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
