By Sreeju Sudhakaran | Published: February 19, 2017 12:10 pm Shahid Kapoor takes wifey Mira Rajput for a post Valentine’s Day dinner \nSaif Ali Khan, do consider yourself safe for now! For Kangana Ranaut seems to be in a venom-spewing mood, and you seem to be the only one who has been spared even though you are her co-star in Rangoon. She had earlier taken on Shahid Kapoor when she revealed that it was a nightmare to share a cottage with him, as he used to disturb her with his exercise routine. When Shahid Kapoor retorted saying that she has a vivid imaginations, she hit back saying he had taken the copyright of that phrase from Hrithik Roshan. And now using Shahid Kapoor, she seemed to take a dig at her old rival Deepika Padukone. \nIn a recent interview to Pinkvilla, she was explaining about why she feel irked when people keep asking her about her lovemaking scenes in Rangoon . She said, “”When you are enacting a scene, we don’t do time pass. When we are asked questions on intimate scenes, especially to girls, there is a sleazy undertone to it. ‘Kaise laga aapko kiss karke?’ What am I supposed to say? I can’t say acha laga ya kharab laga. My purpose is to answer it as an actor. So as an actor I said there were 50 people while we were shooting in the mud scene. And my co-actor had a cold. So it was the most convenient thing to do. It was made into a horrible…. I don’t take these things seriously. Also, media needs to understand that they shouldn’t ask such questions. They ask me who is the better kisser? Mujhe kya lena dena? What do you mean? These men have just had babies and we don’t look at them in that way.” \nOkay, we know there is nothing incriminating in that portion, but do read carefully what she says ahead, ” This is our work and it is our rozi roti. But people talk in such a frivolous way. And I never talk like that about my work. There is always a risk of being misquoted horribly but it is better than saying I love Shahid’s boxers . Isn’t it better?” \nUnderstood this highlighted reference? This is similar to what Deepika Padukone said about Ranbir Kapoor’s boxers when she was promoting Tamasha with him, “Ranbir has the cutest boxers by the way.” That’s so smart and sly way to take down your opponent’s remarks. \nWe learnt two things from this entire incident – 1. Kangana never forgives her rivals; 2. She keeps a track on what Deepika Padukone says in media.
