The meeting suggested that those in the region aligned with Moscow were hoping to use Trump’s associates as a way of changing US foreign policy. It came against a backdrop of reports of an ideological struggle over foreign policy within the Trump administration. \nAsked about the meeting on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, Natalia Galibarenko said such interventions were in breach of the Ukrainian national interest. “We are not trading our territories. We are not going to say, ‘Let us abandon Crimea and in return let us see peace in Donbas’.” she said. \nBoth Donbas and Crimean were Ukrainian territories, “so why should we trade this with Russia ?”, Galibarenko said. \nAny Ukrainian politicians involved in such deals were answerable to their conscience, she added. \nGalibarenko said she was assured by remarks from the US vice-president, Mike Pence, and the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, that sanctions would be maintained against Moscow until it ends its support for Russian nationalists in eastern Ukraine. \nShe admitted she had been concerned by Trump’s previous remarks about Ukraine but, following meetings between Pence and the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, in Munich at the weekend, said she was convinced “America will not accept the annexation of Crimea and will insist that Russia fulfil the Minsk agreement. The policy will be consistent on sanctions against Russia.” \nShe was sceptical about the advent of a new ceasefire in Ukraine, due to come into force on Monday, saying it was the fifth time such a ceasefire had been declared, and in numerous cases the absence of hostility had lasted little more than a day. \nUnder the plan reported by the NYT, Ukrainian voters would decide in a referendum whether Crimea, the territory Russia seized in 2014, would be leased to Russia for a 50-year or 100-year term. Artemenko said Russian leaders supported his proposal, the Times reported. \nArtemenko belongs to a bloc that opposes Poroshenko. The group’s efforts were previously aided by Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager. \nCohen has been in the spotlight since his name was mentioned in a dossier prepared by a former British spy hired by Trump’s political opponents that suggested he had served as a liaison between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign, an allegation he has emphatically denied.
