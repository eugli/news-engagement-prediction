Getty Images 5 Tom Daley had a secret 18-month affair with a hunky male model \nBrit model Ed began chatting online with Tom after a chance meeting in the street in 2014. \nOur source said: “They live near each other in London and caught each other’s eye. Tom Daley with Edward William \n“Ed obviously knew who Tom was, and was single at the time, so sent him a message.” \nHe was initially invited to a barbecue at Tom and Dustin’s flat in Borough, South London, and had coffees with the pair, who had recently gone public. \nBut Tom is then said to have invited him round when Dustin, who he called Lance, was out of the country, leaving Ed in no doubt as to his intentions. 5 Taking the plunge . . . Edward in the tub \nOur source said: “Ed said the messages Tom sent would say things like, ‘I’m home and horny, can you come round?’ \n“Others would say, ‘Lance is away, are you going to be about?’” \nEd is believed to have told his friends about their meetings and their relationship became an open secret among sections of the local gay community. \nThe insider said: “Ed told them it was a purely physical relationship with not much emotion involved. \n“He said Tom was very confident and forward with a huge sex drive.” 5 How The Sun covered Tom’s cyber sex romps last month \nLast month we revealed how Tom had internet sex sessions with a male fan from Liverpool but the star said he had been on a break from Dustin at the time. \nHe said: “We don’t have secrets. \n“It’s totally crucial to us that we are completely and totally open with each other.” \nOur source went on: “Ed met Dustin socially at the start of the friendship, but he thinks he did not know Tom was contacting him privately. \n“It would always happen when Dustin was away and would be quite short-lived. \n“They would hook up for half an hour or an hour and that would be it. \n“Tom would rarely talk about Dustin to Ed, except to say that he was away. Getty Images Tom with hubby-to-be film director Dustin Lance Black \n“His and Tom’s meetings had an air of secrecy about them. \n“Ed is not sure about Tom and Dustin’s relationship and has said that perhaps they have an agreement that each of them can do what they want.” \nEd and Tom’s affair ended in 2015 but they have been in touch as recently as this month.
