(photo credit:REUTERS) \nHezbollah is not worried about United States President Donald Trump, the Los Angeles Times reported on Sunday . In fact, they're optimistic about him.Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the terrorist organization, brushed off the US's newly firm stance against terror in a televised speech Sunday. \"So what if Trump comes?\" he asked. \"What's new?\" Hezbollah supports Syria ceasefire and political talks He went on to say, \"We are not worried, but very optimistic because when an idiot resides in the White House, this is the beginning of the release for the oppressed in the world,\" he said. The Times noted that the Arabic word for \"idiot\" could also be translated as \"fool.\"Nasrallah also said that Trump has revealed \"The true face of the US Administration,\" which he said was \"ugly, unjust, criminal and racist.\"Much of the speech was focused on the conflict in Syria. Nasrallah announced that Hezbollah strongly supports the Syrian ceasefire agreed on in Kazakhstan and any truce that could lead to a political solution. ( Trump vows to fight ISIS and 'radical Islamic terrorism' on Dec. 17, 2016) Moscow and Ankara brokered a shaky ceasefire in December between the Syrian government and rebel groups opposed to President Bashar Assad.The agreement led to indirect talks last month in the Kazakh capital of Astana, where Russia, Turkey and Iran agreed to monitor the fragile truce.Several senior Hezbollah commanders and hundreds of fighters have died in Syria, where the Shi'ite Iranian-backed group is fighting in support of Assad.\"Hezbollah strongly supports, not just the Astana ceasefire, any ceasefire agreed upon in Syria,\" Nasrallah said, in order \"to prevent bloodshed and pave the way for political solutions\".Nasrallah said the battle in Aleppo city had changed the path of the Syrian conflict, now in its sixth year.Syrian government forces, helped by Russian air power and Iranian-backed militia, drove rebel groups out of east Aleppo in December, in Assad's most important gain of the war.\"For six years, Syria faced the risk of the collapse of the state,\" Nasrallah said. \"This danger has been mostly overcome.\" Relevant to your professional network?
