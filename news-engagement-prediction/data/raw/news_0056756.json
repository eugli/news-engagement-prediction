Wade Phillips ( @sonofbum ) is eager to get to work with this Rams defense #MobSquad pic.twitter.com/9AxTVCRjNF \n— Los Angeles Rams (@RamsNFL) February 21, 2017 \nThe Rams finished last season ranked ninth in yards allowed, but also 23rd in points. The unit gave up 32 touchdown passes, and opposing quarterbacks finished with a 95.5 passer rating. \nExpect Phillips, who helped the Denver Broncos win a Super Bowl in 2015 with one of the best defenses in recent memory, to get better results from an otherwise talented group in Los Angeles. \n“They had a good defense last year. That’s a good thing,” Phillips said. “Normally, when I come in as a defensive coordinator, they had a real bad defense, and so they want you to fix it.” \nOnly minor fixes will be required in Los Angeles. \nAll-Pro Aaron Donald headlines one of the game’s best defensive lines, and starting linebackers Alec Ogletree and Mark Barron are both young and experienced. The team has decisions to make on cornerback Trumaine Johnson and safety T.J. McDonald, but there aren’t many pieces missing from what could be a top defense. \nThe Rams hope Phillips will be able to tie the whole thing together. \n“To be successful and play good, you have to play good on your side of the ball,” Phillips said. “We try to get our guys ready to play and get them to play really well on the defensive side, and that helps the team overall.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:26:12.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
