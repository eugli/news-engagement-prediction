Against a basket of currencies, the dollar .DXY matched a low from Dec. 8 at 99.430 to end January with a loss of 2.6 percent. \nThe jump in the yen was likely to pressure stocks of Japanese exporters and Nikkei futures NKc1 pointed to a softer start in Tokyo. \nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was little changed with China still on holiday. \nAPPLE BEATS \nInvestors’ hopes for a fiscal boost to the world’s largest economy under Trump have been tempered by controversial and protectionist policies that have seen him suspend travel to the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries. \nThe policy uncertainty only added to expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep interest rates steady when it concludes a two-day meeting later Wednesday. \nThe setback for Wall Street has been limited so far. \nWhile the S&P 500 fell on Tuesday for a fourth consecutive session, it still ended higher for the month. The Dow .DJI dipped 0.54 percent, while the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.09 percent and the Nasdaq .IXIC 0.02 percent. \nApple ( AAPL.O ) shares also jumped 3.3 percent as sales of iPhones beat expectations, helping turn Nasdaq e-mini futures NQc1 positive after the bell. \nSafe-haven bonds benefited from the air of unease over Trump’s policies and yields on 10-year Treasury debt US10YT=RR eased to 2.45 percent from 2.48 percent early in the week. \nThe retreat in the dollar also boosted a range of commodities, with copper touching a two-month high CMCU3. \nBrent crude oil LCOc1 for April was quoted 17 cents firmer at $55.49, while U.S. crude CLc1 eased 4 cents to $52.77. \n(Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Eric Meijer) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:39:17.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
