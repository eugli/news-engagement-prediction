You have to plan to get everything set up and it’s like, ‘What am I going to wear?’ This is a red carpet with like actors and actresses and these images are going to live on the internet, and I’m like, I know I’m not going to feel my best,” she explains. \nDouglas hasn’t been spending much time with her gold-medal winning teammates since their group obligations wrapped. \n“We’re all over. I’m in LA, Simone’s in Houston, Aly is in Boston, so it’s not like we’ve been together, we were just picked and chosen for a very special moment,” she explains. “We’ve known each other because we’ve been training and competing against each other for a long time, but after the Olympics, it’s kind of like everyone scattered. People are not contracted to stay together, we’re just there for a job and then everyone kind of does their own thing.” \nDouglas’“own thing” is now taking on important tasks, like empowering other women. She will be at the NFL Women’s Summit on February 3 (livestreamed on MAKERS.com ) and at the MAKERS Conference February 6-8, where she’ll be speaking about “empowerment, confidence, and beauty.” \nGoing from the uneven bars to the speaking podium is a big adjustment for Douglas. “I get really nervous. I’m like, ‘Calm down, I’m pretty sure the Olympics is much harder,’” she says. “This is kind of new to me.” PHOTOS: Celebrity Activists! \nBut the fear is worth it to Douglas, especially when it comes to sharing her experiences with cyberbullying and educating the public on how damaging it can be. Her own experiences with online trolls came during what should have been the happiest moment in her year: winning another all-around team medal in gymnastics for Team USA. Instead of celebrating, Douglas learned she was being attacked online for everything from not smiling enough to not putting her hand on her heart during the National Anthem.

At that moment, you just have got to take the high road and that’s what I’m doing.” \nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!
