An elderly woman who apparently tried to separate the two sides also fell to the ground. \nTwo policemen were slightly injured in the tussle, one in the wrist and the other in the leg. Also injured were the woman and three monks. \nOn Sunday, the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) issued a statement demanding that laymen and monks who were not residents of Wat Phra Dhammakaya leave the temple by 3pm. \nIn response, thousands of monks and followers broke through barricades and entered the temple, presurring officials to end the temple search. \nVideo by Wichan Charoenkaitpakul.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T10:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:53:03.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
