(Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images) \nIf I know my audience like I think I do, then you were torn on Sunday at Torrey Pines. \nJon Rahm’s breakthrough win was genuinely awesome, especially how he converted on the last hole for the eagle from the fringe. And talk about deflating. He posted 13-under 275 from the fifth-to-last threesome and still won by three. As it turned out, par at 18 would have been enough, but it would have buoyed the hope of the also-rans in real time. Instead, no one challenged when his long-range curler found the target. \nThen there’s the side of you that wanted the 22-year-old to fall short so that you’d have an easy call at this week’s   Open. We’re so keen on investing in the climb that we can lose sight of our best intentions. It’s one of the numerous reasons why I chase top 10s, not Ws. And yes, Rahm projects to deliver on that promise at TPC Scottsdale where he finished T5 as an amateur two years ago. Quite simply, separate your standard inhibitions when sizing up the lumbering Spaniard. As I wrote in the full-membership fantasy ranking in the preseason, he’s special. \nIf you’re that gamer who patently refuses to plug in last week’s winner, you don’t need to venture far to find a suitable surrogate. In fact, the choices line up like a holiday buffet. \nHideki Matsuyama defends his playoff victory (over Rickie Fowler, who I am not endorsing as a selection). You can wait for the world’s fifth-ranked golfer and burn him in a tournament that yields more FedExCup points – the Masters, THE PLAYERS and the PGA Championship (at Quail Hollow) comprise the short list before the Playoffs – but his record at the WMPO is as convincing as anyone’s anywhere in the last three years. Sure, there are concerns about him peaking in the last quarter of 2016, but TPC Scottsdale is his jam. I’m not talking you out of it. \nHowever, suppose you holster Matsuyama because successfully defending a title is rare and you have the highest of expectations, then walk away from the table full of goodies with one of the following: Keegan Bradley, Ryan Moore, Pat Perez, Webb Simpson or Brendan Steele. All but Perez are headliners in our format as he valuates as a 1a in two-man games. I’m going with Keegs since it’s all about the tee-to-green game on this redesign. The data in Comfort Zone is overwhelming. My crosshairs had been positioned on Moore or Steele, but Bradley is burning a hole in my pocket protector. \nAlmost as intriguing and attractive are Harris English and Russell Knox. The American also looks like a 1a, but he’s a primary in this tournament. He’s also bouncing off a T14 at Torrey Pines. Knox is our rover. You can play him just about anywhere and he’ll get the job done. Really no need to tap into him now. \nTony Finau and Gary Woodland are humming along, but note that the WMPO isn’t included for either in Future Possibilities below. Yet, if you’re inclined, point the compass at Finau. This goes for two-man formats, too. \nPurposefully absent from this space until now are Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth. Save for more valuable points distributions and the Playoffs. Just do it. Even if this field wasn’t as meaty, the advice would be the same. \nAs it concerns Bubba Watson, rather than rehash my approach here, please check it out in the Fantasy Insider . In short, he’s not passing my eye test. \nWhich brings us to the tournament’s all-time earnings leader, Phil Mickelson. There’s really nothing not to love about the setup, but you’d be forcing it when there’s more reliability elsewhere. Furthermore, save him for either the FedEx St. Jude Classic or the PGA Championship. When you combine his last four appearances at both TPC Southwind and Quail Hollow, he’s 8-for-8 with six top fives and a pair of T11s. Given the dynamics of the major, the primer for the U.S. Open in Memphis gets my nod.
