Well, if you're having a glass of vino it's only fair to treat your furry friend to one too. \nRaise a glass to 'cat wine' - the latest kitty treat to hit the market, meaning Manchester cat lovers will never have to drink alone again. \nImported from the US by the Altrincham based pet company B&V trading, it's the pawfect way to treat your Moggy at the weekend. As well as the usual, everyday, pet essentials like hand knitted dog jumpers, organic paw balm, Peamutt Butter (peanut butter for dogs), and birthday cards for pets, the animal-mad trader sells a selection of dog and cat wine. \nPetwinery's Meowsling from Florida is their biggest seller says owner Rob Benson, who sells his animal treats at the traditional covered market at Altrincham Market . \nSo is it really wine? \"No,\" says Rob. Oh. https://www.instagram.com/p/BPgv8S1juoZ/?taken-by=petwinery/embed \n\"It's water organically infused with salmon and catnip,\" he explains. \"It's two of their favourite things.\" \nIt's more of a health drink, Rob adds, and his regular customers say that their cats love it. \nAnd at £6 a bottle for 1.6 oz (£7 including P&P) - they'd better love it. \n\"We've done it for a year, and we've got a really good customer base... it's very unique and it's got the novelty factor,\" says Rob. \nPooches don't have to miss out either. Not only does B&V sell dog wine, Chorlton 'dog deli' Betty & Butch is selling beer brewed specially for man's best friend . (Photo: Betty and Butch) \nThe Barlow Moor Road store - which specialises in artisan, anti-preservative dog food - was one of the first to stock Woof Dog Beer when it launched in August 2015. \nOwner Angel Moore says: \"people's first reaction is normally, 'oh my God - beer for dogs?! It is very popular, I would say around 98 per cent of dogs like it... I make doggy ice lollies with it - they love it.\" \nVisit bandvtrading.com to order online or visit Altrincham Market to pick up a bottle in person on Tuesday, Saturday or Sunday.
