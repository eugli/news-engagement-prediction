A traumatised woman turns up in the night at the police station in town. A single tear rolls from a faraway blue eye down her cheek. Her name is Trish and she has been raped. \nDS Ellie Miller and DI Alec Hardy (Olivia Colman and David Tennant) arrive; they’re on the case. It’s what Chris Chibnall’s Broadchurch needed – a new case – after the second series. You don’t really remember the second series? Exactly, it was a bit of a mess. While the near-perfect genius of the first series is still hauntingly clear, I bet. \nTrish (such a good performance by Corrie’s Julie Hesmondhalgh) is taken to a centre for the post-sexual assault process to begin. It’s grim – examinations and swabs and gloves and lots of evidence bags. And yet Miller’s calm, comforting presence makes it less horrendous – almost as if it’s a call by Colman, and the show, for attacked women to come forward. That they will be taken seriously and feel safe. \nMiller’s and Hardy’s responses to the case are different. For her, it is as a woman as well as a detective. This is more than just a case to be solved. “She’s been raped!” she snaps, when Hardy gives her a hard time for giving Trish her own mobile number. \nIt’s brilliant by both Colman and Tennant again, a portrait of a close working relationship that is at times tetchy, at others bordering on close friendship, but always convincing and so very human. \nThere are other stars. The Jurassic Coast; Harbour cliff; an English manor house and park … bucolic beauty for a beast to run wild in. A shout-out to composer Ólafur Arnalds’s soundscape, too. His music is integral rather than incidental, and adds to rather than distracts from proceedings. And every sound – the running water that helped to cover up the crime, the taping up of another evidence bag – has resonance and significance, as well as helping put you right in there. \nI worried a little bit when the Latimers turned up. Beth and Mark, the parents of murdered Danny, remember? Beth is now a counsellor and has been assigned to Trish. Mark has written – and regrets – a book about Danny. Here is Paul Coates, the vicar, too. Is Broadchurch going to go back on itself, tripping up and getting muddled? That is what happened in the second series, which also tangled it all up with another failed child murder case from Hardy’s past. \nBut then Broadchurch is as much about a small-town community, and what happens when something terrible happens to it, as it is a crime drama. Of course these people are still going to be around. And the new series has new momentum. So far, at least, it’s a return to form. \n*** \nNo one really knows what goes on in the House of Lords, do they? I mean, normal people don’t know. Well, luckily they have let the cameras in for Meet the Lords (BBC2): not just into the chamber but the corridors, library, dining room, kitchens, terrace, everywhere. \nThe majority of the Lords are over 70; many are over 90. “It is the best day-care centre for the elderly in London,” claims Lord Tyler. Families can drop them off, the staff will look after them, they will be given nice meals subsidised by the taxpayer and they can have a snooze in the chamber in the afternoon. \nGhosts of cabinets pasts – Lawson, Tebbit, Carrington – appear from dark panels. Baroness Oona King ruffles a few feathers, by not being 70, or white, and by wearing trainers. But then she buggers off to YouTube in Silicon Valley, where she might fit in better. Lord Bird, who launched the Big Issue, manages to say “bugger” and “ponce” in his inaugural speech. But it is Lord Palmer – hereditary, lives in a proper pile with a silver staircase (actually made of silver) – who is best value. I mean for television entertainment, rather than to the taxpayer. He can no longer watch it – television – at work, as the telly room has been turned into an office, something he has submitted a written question about. \nYes, there is plenty of ammunition for reformers here. But we also see the House of Lords doing what it is supposed to do – influencing, amending and hopefully improving legislation. “We’re a bit like a composting machine,” explains Lord Dobbs. “Whatever comes out the other end is always more fragrant and more fertile than what went in … We are really just parliamentary worms.” Lovely.
