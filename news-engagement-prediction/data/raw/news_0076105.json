From 3-D printing stations to streaming video services to free museum passes, Long Island’s libraries are going well beyond the books. Here are some programs that may surprise you.\nUse a 3-D printer (Credit: Marisol Diaz)\nMore and more libraries are installing “maker stations” equipped with computers, 3-D printers and other gadgets that inspire patrons to create tangible items. Merrick’s library was the first on Long Island to have a digital media center, says director Ellen Firer. These days, the space has three 3-D printers, 3-D pens and a Cricut electronic cutting machine that draws “a lot of kids with their parents,” Firer says. Visitors — the space is open to the public — can choose from preloaded items to print or scan/design their own creation, paying 50 cents per half-hour of print time.\nLevittown library’s expansive Innovation Station includes sewing and embroidery machines and a button maker (nonprofit groups also can book cooking time in the updated kitchen that shares the space).\nPublic libraries in Jericho, Centereach/Selden, Smithtown and Holbrook are among those that also offer 3-D printing, although some locations may restrict use to their own cardholders or require appointments.\nPictured: Kohana Bloom, 7, waits for her Stretch Cat to be created at the Walter Mintz Digital Media Center at the Merrick Public Library on Jan. 12, 2016.\nBorrow a museum pass (Credit: Jeff Bachner)\nMost public libraries lend patrons free admission passes to the Long Island Children’s Museum, Cradle of Aviation, Old Westbury Gardens and Manhattan’s Museum of Modern Art and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Passes typically cover admission for up to four people and generally can be borrowed for up to three days. It’s a popular perk — so you’ll want to reserve your pass up to 60 days ahead of time.\nPictured: Kalia Fecu, 6, makes a huge bubble at the Long Island Children's Museum in Garden City on Oct. 12, 2016.\nDownload free music sign up\nRelated Media 24 free (or cheap) things for families to do on LI 100 books every kid should read before growing up 50 best places for LI families in 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:06:26.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
