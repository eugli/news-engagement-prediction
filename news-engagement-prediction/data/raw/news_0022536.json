Tow trucks couldn't get out, we just didn't know what we were going to do.”\nScott then contacted the company that plows his driveway.\n“Within three minutes they called me, they sent a truck, the guy came, got our car unstuck so we didn't desert it in the middle of the road and he drove us to the hospital,” says Scott. “Big Tom was his name; he was like our guardian angel.”\nBig Tom, also known as Tom Beaudin, says he first saw the car buried in the snow, then a woman rushing out of her garage.\n“I think she knew I was coming to pick her up, but I didn’t know,” says Beaudin. “So I helped her in my truck and we put their suitcase and everything in the back.”\nThe mother-to-be made it to the hospital and at 9:34 a.m., her son Kai Alexander Johnson was born atseven pounds, two ounces.\nMother and newborn are doing fine.\n“She's doing great, unfortunately she’s not up for video but she’s doing really well,” says new dad Scott. “She’s a champion today, she did really well.”\nThe parents aren’t the only ones excited.\n“I heard it's a baby boy and I hope they have a happy life and he's going to have a cool story,” says Beaudin. “I'll have a cool story for the rest of my life as well.”\nWith files from CTV Atlantic’s Nick Moore \nPhotos The mother-to-be made it to the hospital and at 9:34 a.m., her son Kai Alexander Johnson was born at seven pounds, two ounces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:01:05.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
