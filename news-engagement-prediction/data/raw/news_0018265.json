We’re in Britain, a few years from now: driverless cars and self-stocking fridges are a reality, but the housing crisis has only got worse. Like most thirtysomethings, “middle-class underachiever” Karl and his wife, Genevieve, find that their rent always outstrips their earnings, even though their living space is a wallpapered conservatory in a shared house. Credit‑card juggling and a spot of last‑ditch online fraud land Karl in trouble, but instead of prison, he and Genevieve are offered a place on The Transition: a six‑month hiatus during which they will live with an older, more successful couple, learn from them about all that boring adult stuff like self-reliance, financial planning and dental hygiene, and save up enough money for a starter rabbit hutch on the bad side of town. \nThe growing divide between homeowners and renters, the galloping corporatisation of modern life and the disappearance of middle-class safety nets are the driving forces behind this dystopia in a velvet glove. “My generation kicked the ladder away behind us,” continues Stuart, who along with his wife Janna will be a mentor to Karl and Genevieve. “This is our chance to teach you to free-climb.” Stuart is gloriously irritating – the kind of man who affects a mohican to subvert people’s expectations of him and then explains that actually the Mohicans styled their hair in patches: “This is closer to an Iro.” Part of the pleasure of this richly enjoyable book is the spiky comedy of manners between the smugly successful Stuart and Janna, curating every aspect of their lives like a stock portfolio, and the flailing Karl and Genevieve, muddling along and trying not to think about the future. \nBut as Karl rebels against the constraints of The Transition, and begins investigating its secrets, while Genevieve appears to blossom in the glow of Stuart and Janna’s attention, an air of menace creeps in. Who scratched “not_all_transition” into the bedpost? What happens when you’re “B-streamed”? And what’s going on in the basement? In Kennard’s vision of social control, flat whites are on tap, although they cost more than the baristas make in an hour \nKennard is an overachieving poet, the youngest ever finalist for a Forward prize back in 2007; his work combines accessibility with formal daring and a twist of surrealism. He brings all these qualities to his novel, along with a jaunty lightness that makes the pages slip by deceptively easily. The book is studded with literary in-jokes, as Kennard mines the comic possibilities of Karl’s job writing online essays for lazy students (“It was dishonourable work, but he was getting paid for doing what he loved in a competitive economy, and how many people really got to use their degrees in the real world?”). It also nods to the banned book-within-a-book in Nineteen Eighty‑Four with a mysterious novel circulating that is rumoured to explain the origins of The Transition, as well as a “Mentor’s Guide” made up of gnomic parables; passages from these add rhetorical flourishes to the even‑tempered prose. \nIn the grimly impoverished world of Nineteen Eighty-Four , real coffee is only for the elite. In Kennard’s vision of social control, flat whites are constantly on tap, although they cost more than the baristas serving them make in an hour: even dystopias are gentrified these days. His dissection of the way contemporary capitalism harnesses every response to it, using rebellion and dissent as fuel for expansion, is all the more chilling for its aspirational flourishes. \nBut what really makes this novel stand out is not the Black Mirror -style black comedy but the tenderly devastating portrait of mental illness. Smart, funny, brilliant Genevieve has bipolar disorder, and the burden of living with the illness, for her and for the besotted, anxious Karl, is slowly revealed throughout the book. The atmospheric prickles in the air as a heightened mood blows in; Karl’s rising fear as her voice gets faster and her fidgeting increases; the deadness in her eyes when depression hits. “‘Who are you? Where is Genevieve?’ ‘I’m sorry?’ She sounded like a politician on the radio.” Kennard untangles the web of codependency that binds them, balancing Karl’s conviction that ill Genevieve is another person entirely against her need to own all aspects of herself. It’s deeply felt and delicately done. The dystopia turns out to be a love story after all. \n• The Transition is published by 4th Estate.
