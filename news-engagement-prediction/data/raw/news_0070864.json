Possibly. \nSo, whether you’re a budding Hollywood director armed with a smartphone, or just someone who wants to make an Instagram clip look more Instagrammy, grab one of these editors and get cracking on your masterpiece. After all, you’ve only another 29-and-a-half minutes to chop out! iMovie \nConsidered a benchmark release on iOS, and impressively similar to the Mac desktop version, iMovie should be on every iOS device. The app makes it ridiculously easy to splice together shot footage, but there’s a lot more to it than that. \nYou can also use it to add titles, music, voiceovers and photos to your work of art - and if you want to cheese it up, take your pick from a bunch of TV-style templates and movie trailer themes. With recent Apple kit, it’ll even deal with 4K. \nDownload iMovie for iOS (£4.99/free with devices activated after June 2014) PowerDirector \nAndroid often ends up second-best when it comes to creative fare, but that’s not the case with video. PowerDirector in many ways echoes iMovie, providing a user-friendly but powerful editor. \nClips can quickly be arranged and trimmed, titles can be added, and you get a decent set of transitions to experiment with. Pay the one-off IAP (£2.99) to rid your movies of watermarks and export at up to 4K. \nDownload PowerDirector for Android (£free + IAP) LumaFusion \nWhile iMovie is great at what it does, it’s geared towards casual use. If you want to take things to the next level, try LumaFusion. \nDesigned for efficiency, and aimed at mobile journalists and filmmakers, the app includes multi-track editing with realtime preview, superb (and occasionally bonkers) animation, effects and transitions, and a powerful titler. \nIt’s the closest you’ll get to desktop-style video-editing app on your iPad or iPhone. \nDownload LumaFusion for iOS (£19.99) KineMaster \nOne of the most impressive things about this Android video editor is that it’s so simple to use - even on quite a small smartphone. \nIt uses screen space remarkably well, making it a cinch to arrange your clips, add additional layers (captions, images, and even ‘handwriting’), quickly import extra footage and play around with effects. \nIt’s just a pity the developer saddled it with a restrictive subscription payment model rather than a one-off cost: the monthly subscription will set you back £2.91, or you can get a year for £23.25. \nDownload KineMaster for Android (£free + IAP) Movie Edit Touch \nThis one shows that Windows Phone at least has the potential to match Android and iOS in the app stakes. \nIt’s a generously featured video editor that works much like iMovie, allowing you to make frame-by-frame edits, join clips up with neat transitions, add titles and soundtracks, and export the results as HD movies. It’s fast, well-behaved and powerful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T13:50:20.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
