But when he heard she had met another man, he flew into a rage, threatening her with a hammer. He told her if she did not revoke the order she would not see her children again and police would find her body parts in bin bags. The receptionist lived in fear of Mohammed Badiuzzaman, 38, who forced her into an Islamic marriage and insisted she wear a veil When the pair arrived at a solicitor's office in Watford, Hertfordshire, staff called local police. Mrs Thandi told them she had been abducted, threatened and raped. But when the case was handed to Scotland Yard, she retracted her claims. The rape was not recorded as a crime. Information that could have triggered a further inquiry was missed because her name was misspelt. Two weeks later, in July 2013, police received a silent phone call from one of Mrs Thandi's children. When officers arrived at her home, they found her body hidden under a duvet. Badiuzzaman was branded 'manipulative, devious and controlling' as a judge jailed him for 17 years for murder in May 2014. Newham Council uncovered a catalogue of errors, including police failing to react three times when Mrs Thandi told them she was being abused. Retired detective Mark Yexley found officers, NHS workers and education staff failed to 'join the dots'. He said: 'It is the opinion of the panel that adherence to procedures and communication between agencies, in particular the police, may well have prevented the death.' Three years ago, after a watchdog found 'alarming and unacceptable weaknesses' in how police handle domestic abuse, then home secretary Theresa May said: 'I expect chief constables to respond by changing radically their response to domestic violence.' Professor Liz Kelly, of London Metropolitan University's child and woman abuse studies unit, said Mrs Thandi's case shows how much more must be done. She added: 'Yet again we are told the Metropolitan Police has learned lessons … These are 'weasel words' … Like many before her Sabeen did what police encourage women to do. She reported, repeatedly … It is time the broken system of police response to violence against women in London was mended.' The Met's Commander Stuart Cundy said: 'We accept there are things we could have done better … We have taken steps as a direct result of Sabeen's death to ensure victims are better supported at these difficult times.' The Independent Police Complaints Commission said there was a 'breakdown in processes' and a lack of 'appropriate training'. But commissioner Derrick Campbell insisted 'we will never know if a different police response would have saved Sabeen's life'. The full report will not be made public due to the 'adverse impact' it would have on her family.
