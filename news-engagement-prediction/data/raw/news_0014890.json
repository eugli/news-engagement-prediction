I suppose we could talk about sports. It must be cool to be the only president inducted into the World Wrestling Entertainment Hall of Fame. Receiving a stunner from \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin is a proud accomplishment for any man. \nOr we could talk about how you helped make the United States Football League Great Again. Oh wait, you led the charge to its demise. #awkward. \nI confess we don't have much common ground, except on one thing: \nWe have strong opinions on stuff. You have a much greater and powerful voice as the leader of the Free World. I have a much smaller one as a columnist and pack leader of two Boxers. \nAs you know, our differences make for noisy and combustible chatter along the Interwebs. \nPosts complaining about political posts now seem to outnumber political posts, but everybody still loves puppies and double espressos, though maybe not at Starbucks. #complicated. \nSocial media, particularly Facebook, have been hijacked by partisan food fights, which is OK as long as you don't start a rant with \"Your (sic) an idiot.\" Come on. Everyone knows that Idiot should always be capitalized when addressing someone directly. \nWe're all experts on foreign policy, human rights, terrorism and free trade. We all know that Meryl Streep, Hamilton and Saturday Night Live are overrated, and Kellyanne Conway needs to find a new hairdresser, preferably a gay one, so she can look presentable at the candlelight vigil for the survivors of the Bowling Green Massacre. #NoSheDidn't. \nAnd so it goes. Friends and family who love The Donald. Friends and family who can't stand him. And perhaps the most frustrated audience of all: \nThose who really don't care. \nOf all eligible voters, about 45 percent didn't vote. That's a 20-year low, that includes about half of millennials, (voters between the ages of 18 and 29). Collectively, millennials are sick and tired of corporate greed, which obviously played a role in turning them into couch potatoes on election night. \nThere's too much yin and yang to debate the pros and cons of two polarizing presidential candidates, which explains why someone I know penciled in \"Wilma Flintstone\" as a write-in candidate. \nWhat disturbs me most are the stay-at-home numbers. You should care enough about this country to have a say in its future. That voice is in your vote. \nDonald Trump. Hillary Clinton. Wilma Flintstone. Pick somebody. \nThis apathy circles back to our current state of affairs. The more liberal and progressive side has taken to the streets in protest. The more conservative side is basically saying \"na na na na nananana…, we won. Quit crying, losers!\" \nThe guy leading the chorus: President Trump. \nContentious crossfire led by a contentious president. Can we agree on that, perhaps? \nPresident Trump hasn't exactly extended a hand to everyone he perceives as enemies, which seems to be anybody who doesn't agree with everything he says. Being combative plays to the base. It does not play to the majority of voters who cast their ballots for Clinton (not alternate facts) nor everyone else, to borrow the title from the 1972 pop hit by Stealers Wheel — \"Stuck in the Middle With You.\" \nThe reality is that we're not going to have any kumbaya moments soon. And if you circle back to an alternate universe, we would not have had any kumbaya moments with President Hillary Clinton. Do the math. The GOP controls Congress. \nOur Facebook friends are really a microcosm of the real world. There are a lot of passionate people blasting away on keyboards. And there are a lot of people who are apathetic, or just want to stifle the noise while asking everyone for prayers because Aunt Mable is having gallstone surgery. \nI'm not sure we will ever get back to those Happy Days. As a compromise, I suggest the mix-and-match rule. For every political rant, post something positive. Let's give a shout-out to cats and puppies and kiddos now and then. \nSurely we can agree on that. \nUnless you hate cats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:15:31.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
