While Courtney Walsh is in Hyderabad as the bowling coach of Bangladesh, Brian Lara was here in pursuit of his latest vocation: golf. The West Indian batsman, whose silken strokes evoked awe, was equally enthralled by the quality of the Hyderabad Golf Association Course with the Golconda Fort in the backdrop, and the veteran of 131-Test vintage and 11,953 runs was clear why India were numero uno in Test cricket. \" Virat Kohli is one of the best batsmen in contemporary cricket and has his own style of batting. I am not the kind to rate players or compare him with anyone. Even in captaincy, he has his own style, which is proving to be very effective,\" Lara said. But the left-hander with 34 Test centuries did not take long to draw his good friend Sachin Tendulkar into the conversation. \"One should remember the impetus provided by the great Sachin (Tendulkar) while at his peak. He passed on a rich legacy to highly talented youngsters and they are ready to take on the world now,\" Lara said.
