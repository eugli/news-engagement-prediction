It's just a beautiful job.\" Photo: BlazeAid volunteers prepare meals for the fencing crews who have started the rebuilding task on farms affected by fires. (ABC Rural: Michael Cavanagh) \nWhile Mr McGregor's house at Cairn Hill on the Golden Highway near Uarbry survived the fires, across the highway neighbour Chris Wentworth Brown lost everything, including his house. \nHe is now dividing his time between living in an old caravan on the property and a house in nearby Dunedoo where his wife and children are staying. \nMr Wentworth Brown said he had only taken his children back to the property once. \n\"I don't think need to see much more wrack and ruin. They were walking around with ash in their eyes,\" he said. \n\"They had to see it, but I don't think they need it rubbed in their faces any more.\" \nKyle Fullford, who has a rural contracting business in Maitland, pulled a team of other contractors together to help out. \nHe said he was deeply affected by seeing properties affected by the fires. \n\"It was breathtaking [and] until you see it, you can't explain,\" Mr Fullford said. \n\"It's very sad to be honest.\" Photo: Some of the cattle sold at Dunedoo will be fattened and sold off to raise money for the recovery effort. (ABC Rural: Michael Cavanagh) \nHe said some fencing materials had been donated by large companies or purchased through cash donations. \nMr Fullford is hoping others will come forward and volunteer to continue with the work when his team has to leave. \n\"I thought 'let's give back to the farmers who give us so much',\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:28:46.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
