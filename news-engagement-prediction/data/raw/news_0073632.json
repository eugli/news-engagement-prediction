But at around –50 C, it might get \"a little syrupy.\" (Fun fact: the same things happens with dish soap, he said.)\nWater, on the other hand, will freeze much quicker.\nAnd water can get into your tank through condensation — the same way it can get on your bedroom windows, Edwards said.\nIf you have have only a small amount of gas in your tank, then there's lots of room for air above it. If that air is warmer than the cold walls of the gas tank, Edwards said, it can lead to condensation, and water running down the walls of the tank into the gas.\n\"And that's not good because the water will freeze, and then you get ice crystals that can get into the fuel line and it will slow the flow and your car will sputter, or worse you can even block the fuel line,\" he said on CBC's Shift .\nIf that does happen, Edwards said a fuel additive containing methanol — which freezes at a very low temperature — sold at automotive stores can usually solve the problem.\nWith files from Shift", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:39:11.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
