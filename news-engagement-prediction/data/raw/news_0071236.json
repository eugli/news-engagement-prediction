Medicinal cannabis crops now legal in Australia Read more \n“As part of these changes, importers will be able to source medicinal cannabis products from a reputable supplier overseas and store these in a safe, secure warehouse in Australia,” Hunt said. \nHe said that within eight weeks, “possibly sooner”, Australia would have a store of imported cannabis to improve access to medicinal marijuana products. \nSpeaking on ABC’s AM, Hunt said there would be a “supply to meet all Australian demand” although that “wouldn’t happen overnight”. \nHunt said that Victoria had told him domestic production will be up and running in that state by the middle of the year and in the long-term supply would be filled by commercial providers. \nOn Friday the Office of Drug Control issued its first cannabis licence , allowing Australian company Cannoperations to legally cultivate and conduct research on medicinal cannabis. Hunt said that provider would take about a year to add to supply. \nGiven the lack of supply in Australia, One Nation has called for an amnesty for medicinal cannabis users who had accessed it illegally. \nMalcolm Turnbull has labelled the idea “irresponsible” because the strength of cannabis not obtained from official providers can be much higher than expected. \nAsked about an amnesty for patients buying cannabis products illegally, Hunt said it was “not an issue for the commonwealth government – that’s an issue entirely under state law”. \n“The states have sole and exclusive ownership of laws dealing with treatment of individuals in possession [of cannabis].” Most marijuana medicinal benefits are inconclusive, wide-ranging study finds Read more \nHunt said he is developing a long-term national health plan including “rock solid support for Medicare”, the hospital system, mental health and medical research. \nThe Turnbull government has come under intense pressure to end the freeze on the Medicare rebate , after Labor made the future of Medicare – and its alleged “privatisation” – a central election issue. \nLast week Turnbull said the government was “open to reviewing” the freeze , but stopped short of promising to end the freeze, which is due to last until 2020. \nThe measure is set to save the government $2.8bn over six years, and would cost $925.3m to unfreeze in the final two years. \nHunt said the government is willing to review the Medicare rebate freeze “to help make the system stronger and better”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:11:54.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
