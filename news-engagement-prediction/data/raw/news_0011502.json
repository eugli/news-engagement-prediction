PA:Press Association Archive Alexander MacKinnon has been slapped with a fine after dishing out the sick abuse \nMacKinnon’s social media “likes” include Donald Trump, the BNP and and the far-right English Defence League. \nInvestigating officer PC Mark Mellenthin said: “The victim was visibly distressed and shaken by MacKinnon’s frightening racist outburst. \n“Thankfully the train manager stepped in before the abuse escalated. \n“People like MacKinnon must understand that abusive, racist behaviour like this has no place on the railway and will not be tolerated. \n“Everyone has the right to travel in safety without fear of abuse like this, violence or intimidation. \n“When it does happen we will do everything in our power to bring them before the courts. \n“Hopefully MacKinnon’s substantial fine will make him think twice before unleashing such vitriol on other members of the public.” \nIn court he was fined £1,154 after pleading guilty to a Racially Aggravated Public Order offence.
