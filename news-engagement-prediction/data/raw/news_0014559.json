The Goodwin Smith team applauds you sir. You are truly one of the lads with swagger.” \nThe alleged reply, carrying President Trump's signature, said: “Your letter and gift reached me in the Oval Office. Thank you for thinking of me and your kind gesture. It means a lot. Thank you also for your kind words on my presidency.” \nThe president apparently praised the company for calling him \"one of the lads with swagger\" and quoted from his own 1987 book ,The Art of the Deal, which decries those who ‘think small’.

The included condom gives a unique touch to your brand,” he supposedly wrote. \nHe continues: “You were correct. I am a size 12 and I’m confident the Barley Black would have suited me as my first term begins. \n\"As you are aware, I am half British and I would have been so proud to wear a British product. \n\"Unfortunately, due to White House policy, I am unable to accept unsolicited goods. Please see enclosed the shoes and accept my deepest apology.” \nAppearing to encourage more gifts when he is no longer president, he adds: “For future reference, I tend to distance myself from black as a rule.” \nThe company’s PR manager Simon Smith insists that the letter is genuine and said they had also sent shoes to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \nHe said: “We were very surprised. We couldn’t believe it. It’s obviously not a standard response. He’s obviously read the letter and replied.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:25:59.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
