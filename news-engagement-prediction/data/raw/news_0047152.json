These include omitting any reference to the specifically Jewish character of the Holocaust during International Holocaust Remembrance Day as well as remaining oddly silent about the string of bomb threats and acts of anti-Semitic vandalism. When his daughter Ivanka Trump tweeted on the subject, she also failed to mention “anti-Semitism” or “Jews.” America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers. #JCC \n— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 20, 2017 \nTrump’s opponent from the 2016 presidential election, former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, criticized Trump’s silence on Tuesday morning. JCC threats, cemetery desecration & online attacks are so troubling & they need to be stopped. Everyone must speak out, starting w/ @POTUS . \n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 21, 2017 \nDuring a speech at the African-American History Museum Tuesday, Trump described “the anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community” as a “reminder of the work that must still be done.” In the same speech, he boasted of his support in South Carolina (the home state of Sen. Tim Scott, who joined Trump), claiming that “I like the state of South Carolina. I like all those states where I won by double, double, double digits.” \nThe Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect took to its Twitter account, which is run by Executive Director Stephen Goldstein , to condemn Trump’s comments as inadequate. MR. PRESIDENT, YOUR TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE ACKNOWLEGMENT OF #Antisemitism TODAY IS NOT ENOUGH. Statement of Steven… https://t.co/dfZyaIA3WU \n— AnneFrankCenter(US) (@AnneFrankCenter) February 21, 2017 \nThe Anne Frank Center later released a statement elaborating on its position about Trump’s remarks. \nThe President’s sudden acknowledgment of Anti-Semitism is a Band-Aid on the cancer of Anti-Semitism that has infected his own administration,” the statement says. “His statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting Anti-Semitism, yet day after day have refused to apologize and correct the record. Make no mistake: The Anti-Semitism coming out of this Administration is the worst we have seen from any Administration. The White House repeatedly refused to mention Jews in its Holocaust remembrance, and had the audacity to take offense when the world pointed out the ramifications of Holocaust denial. And it was only yesterday, President’s Day, that Jewish Community Centers across the nation received bomb threats, and the President said absolutely nothing. When President Trump responds to Anti-Semitism proactively and in real time, and without pleas and pressure, that’s when we’ll be able to say this president has turned a corner.
