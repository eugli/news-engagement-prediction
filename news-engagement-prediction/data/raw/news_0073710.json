While Oscar buzz surrounds the film’s lead actors, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, the two weren’t initially set to star in the film. In fact, when the movie was first being developed, it was actually Whiplash ’s Miles Teller and Emma Watson who were signed on to play the young dreamers trying to make it in Los Angeles. Watson reportedly pulled out of the movie first, after landing her highly coveted role of Belle in Disney’s live action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast . After Stone signed on, reports say Teller was dropped from the project because he was said to have been upset that Stone was making more money than him. (Welcome to the world of a Hollywood actress !) Once Teller was out, Gosling came on board, and the rest is history. The first time we saw Gosling and Stone together on-screen was in 2011’s Crazy, Stupid, Love , which we all remember well for that scene in which a drunken Stone ogles at the hunky shirtless actor and yells at him for looking like he was photoshopped. That funny, sexy seduction scene, and its charming Dirty Dancing finale, which probably would have failed in the hands of anyone else, was by far the most memorable one in the romantic comedy. It was also the moment when thousands of moviegoers first fell in love with these two rising young actors. Similar to the logic behind our seemingly endless number of TV reboots, studios love casting a pair of actors who have already displayed great chemistry in the past, because it guarantees the movie will come with a built-in audience. It’s the reason why Gosling and Stone’s second film together, Gangster Squad , a not particularly good L.A. noir starring Sean Penn in terrible makeup, had a decent opening weekend—filmgoers had already become hardcore Stone-and-Gosling loyals . Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in 1945 Photo: Getty Images In the golden age of Hollywood, repeat pairings were a standard practice. Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, an obvious source of inspiration for the couple in La La Land , tapped and twirled together in 10 movies. Charlie Chaplin did his silent shtick next to actress Edna Purviance in 33 films, and also enjoyed a romantic relationship with her for many years. But there are two couples that remain unmatched as the ultimate examples of big-screen romance and box-office success: Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, and Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Bogie and Bacall, as they later were known, first met when the actress (née Betty Joan Perske) was only 19 and starring in her first film, To Have and Have Not , opposite Bogart, who was 45 at the time. The two fell in love, even though he was married, and their palpable attraction on- and off-screen made To Have and Have Not into a box-office smash. They went on to get married and star in three more movies together— The Big Sleep, Dark Passage, Key Largo —all also commercial successes. Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy had a more unconventional history. In her autobiography, Hepburn reveals Tracy first thought she was a lesbian when they were cast together in Woman of the Year . They later began a tumultuous relationship and carried on an open affair for almost 30 years, while also filming a total of nine films together, including classics like Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner and Adam’s Rib. In those three decades, Tracy never left his wife, and it wasn’t until he passed away that Hepburn confirmed their love affair. Cinephiles often lament that they don’t make movie-star romances like they used to. And they’re not wrong. It took nine years before Pretty Woman ’s Julia Roberts and Richard Gere would meet again in Runaway Bride —and that was it for those two. Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey tried to replicate the smash success of their 2003 rom-com, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days , with the awful adventure comedy Fool’s Gold in 2008—the end of that pairing. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were onto something for a minute with Sleepless in Seattle and You’ve Got Mail , but it seems unlikely those two will ever star in anything together again. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler have fallen in love on-screen three times ( The Wedding Singer , 50 First Dates , and Blended ), but they’re not exactly the glamorous couple you want to root for again and again. Even the ultra-charming Jennifer Lawrence and her four-time leading man, Bradley Cooper, haven’t managed to solidify themselves as an It couple on-screen. (You can blame the little-watched Serena for that.) That leaves us with Gosling and Stone, who seem to exist in a league far apart from their contemporaries. As director Chazelle explained in a recent interview with Vogue.com: “They speak the same language. Even though they’re very much their own selves as performers, they’re great at counterpointing each other,” he said. “And they’re really good friends. It’s extra helpful to work with people who are great off-screen together. They each wanted to help the other.” In Crazy, Stupid, Love , you want Gosling’s lothario to find redemption and the joys of monogamy with Stone’s wise-cracking lawyer, who might be impressed with his body, but isn’t so dim as to fall for his one-liners. In La La Land , their courtship is sweet, but not saccharine. Their first date at a movie theater to watch Rebel Without a Cause is sure to make audiences feel butterflies. (And isn’t a little lightheartedness what we need most right now?) Critics and fans are already crossing their fingers, hoping the two sign on to star in something else together soon. And they should: They’re perfect for each other on-screen (no offense, Eva Mendes!), and they’re both at the height of their careers, having just delivered some of their best work opposite one another. Perhaps they will be considered for the planned biopic about Hepburn and Tracy ? Now wouldn’t that be something.
