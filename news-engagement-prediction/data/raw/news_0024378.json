(Photo: Rick Osentoski, USA TODAY Sports) \nWith spring training right around the corner, the Free Press is rolling out its spring preview in this space all week. Pitchers and catchers report to Tiger Town in Lakeland, Fla., on Feb. 14. Today: Who’s going to play centerfield? \nAfter trading Cameron Maybin, the Detroit Tigers will host a competition of question marks in centerfield. The contestants: Tyler Collins, JaCoby Jones, Mikie Mahtook and maybe others. \nJones, a rookie, has the most upside of the bunch, but the team would prefer to get him some more minor league time at Triple-A Toledo. Collins seems better suited as a fourth outfielder and the Comerica Park outfield could present a challenge. Mahtook could be the odds-on favorite . \nThe Tigers acquired him in a trade with the Rays in late January and they believe he will contribute at the big league level. Mahtook’s experience – though short – gives him the edge over Jones. In 2015, he hit .295 with nine home runs and a slugging percentage of .619 in 105 at bats. Last season, his numbers dropped with more playing time (.195, three home runs, .292 slugging in 185 at bats). \nOther Tigers questions:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:51:37.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
