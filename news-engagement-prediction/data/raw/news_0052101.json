More videos Dan Vickerman: 1979 - 2017 \nFormer Wallaby Dan Vickerman has died aged 37. The Brumbies and Waratahs veteran played 63 Tests at lock for Australia. \nMore specifically, those with him in the engine-room will treasure their own memories of him forever more. \n\"When I think of Dan,\" says Al Baxter, who played most of his own 62 Tests with him, \"I will mostly think of his passion, his intensity, his desire to win, to be at his absolute best. Of us all, he was the hardest marker on himself, and he had absolutely no fear. He was so big, so powerful, he could hit an All Black ruck, launch himself and completely destroy it, without ever worrying about what it might do to his own body. Related Content A war that never stops when sporting careers finish \n\"As his teammates, we loved playing with him, he was the bloke in the dressing room before the match who you'd look to, and draw confidence from. But he was demanding of us, too. He was the bloke pushing behind me in the scrum, and his habit was to smack me on the arse before the scrums so hard, saying 'spark up!', I would get bruising . And I remember if Brendan Cannon's lineout throws were off, he would run after him on the field, yelling at him, 'Brendan, this is a TEST match! Get your throws right!'\" \nNe'er a truer word spoken, says Brendan Cannon, who played 42 Test matches with him. Advertisement \n\"From someone else, you wouldn't have taken it well, but with the 'Big V' it was different. Yes, he was being hard on me, but it was nowhere near as hard as he was on himself. He had this intensity about him, that you had to get to know, and as his roommate on all those Wallaby tours, I got to know him very well indeed, and love him. And when he would yell at me on the field, that was just him. He wanted everything done right . And then he would come up to you at half-time, and apologise and say 'Look, I'm sorry, I might have been a bit out of line out there'. I'd say, 'Gee, do you think so?', laugh it off and we'd get on with the Test match. That intensity of his, that desire to win was one of the best things we had going for us and no one wanted to change it.\" \nAnd would he let his hair down afterwards?
