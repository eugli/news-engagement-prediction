Police have detained three suspects, but have not yet filed charges as they try to determine the motive behind the brutal attack. \nSeveral gunshots are heard on the video and a woman yelling “Shots! Shots! Shots!” before the footage abruptly ends. \nThe producer and director Leo Martinez was fatally shot in an office adjacent to the radio booth. The radio station’s secretary Dayaba Garcia suffered a gunshot wound and has undergone emergency surgery, according to local police. \nThree men were detained following the attack, but none of them has been reportedly charged so far. The police has not yet determined a possible motive for the brazen attack. \nThe Milenio Caliente is a popular local program, known for its coverage of social issues coverage and political analysis. The slain announcer had been criticizing pollution problems at Laguna Mallen, a lake in San Pedro which is supposed to be a protected natural resort. \nWhile the harassment and intimidation of journalists covering organized crime and corruption in the Dominican Republic are believed to be quite common, the attack on radio station is unprecedented. \nThe last time a journalist was killed in the country was in 2015, with police putting it down as a robbery which had gone wrong, but neither victim’s car nor his phone were reportedly stolen during that incident. The 2015 case still remains unsolved and no suspects have been identified.
