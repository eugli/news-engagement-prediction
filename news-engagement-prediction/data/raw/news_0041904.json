Beth Arrandale posted this statement on Facebook in support of her daughter \nShe said: “Love is love. If he has these opinions then he should just keep them to himself and not just go screaming at two young girls. \n“All she did was sit next to me, put her arm around me and gave me a kiss because I was not feeling well. It wasn’t a really long, sloppy snog. \n“I have been going to this Morrisons since I was young and the staff are always great. Read More \n“We come to the store almost every day after college. We don’t blame Morrisons for this, as we have never had any problems. \n“It was just the actions of one particular person.” \nChloe said the couple get ‘the occasional glance’ when they are out together but never anything like this. \nShe added: “Louise was just sat there quiet because she was in shock. \n“I was so upset that she had to take me outside. We were both just really confused as to why he just suddenly started shouting. But later this turned to anger. The couple were in Morrisons cafe in Eccles when they say the incident happened \n“It is 2017. No one should be spoken to like that.” \nChloe’s mother, Beth Arrandale, posted a long statement on Facebook in support of her daughter. \nShe wrote: “I’m absolutely disgusted with the ignorant, homophobic and disgraceful treatment of my daughter and her girlfriend by staff at Morrisons in Eccles!!! \n“All they did was have a little kiss (just a peck on the lips) whilst having something to eat in the cafe. Read More \n“They were then confronted by an idiotic and clearly homophobic ‘security guard’ and told they had to get out of Morrisons, that they were disgusting and apparently putting people off their food! \n“If they want to carry on with ‘that’ kind of behaviour then to do it outside!!! \n“Nothing said to the straight couple though, who were sat next to them, who also happened to be cuddling and kissing!!! It’s 2017.” \nA Morrisons spokesperson said: “We take this allegation extremely seriously and we are raising it with our security supplier at this store to find out what happened.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T17:34:02.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
