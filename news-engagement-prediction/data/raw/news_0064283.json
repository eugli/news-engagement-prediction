Some of Trump’s plans for creating jobs and putting more money in people’s pockets will take time, he said. “We’ve got to stick together and make sure we have President Trump for eight years.”\nPriebus’ pleas for patience and unity acknowledged the conservatives’ underlying skepticism about the new president, a former Democrat who in the past has elicited boos at the conference. Trump has often suggested he doesn’t prioritize the social issues many conservatives elevate, and his proposal for a massive infrastructure bill has cast doubts about his commitment to curb government spending.\nWATCH: Priebus and Bannon describe great partnership at CPAC \nBut with a Republican in the White House for the first time in eight years, many activists say they feel energized and more than willing to give him a chance.\nMany in the audience chanted “Trump! Trump! Trump!” as Bannon and Priebus made a joint appearance on stage. The duo’s chummy joint interview seemed designed to refute media reports that they do not get along and are occasionally working at cross-purposes in a factionalized White House.\nPriebus presented their partnership as evidence that conservatives and Trump supporters can work together.\n“The truth of the matter is Donald Trump, President Trump, brought together the party and the conservative movement,” he said. “If the party and the conservative movement are together, similar to Steve and I, it can’t be stopped.”\nWATCH: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos defends White House decision to withdraw transgender bathroom rules \n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos urged the activists to “engage” and “be loud” in the face of politicians who stand in the way of changing the education system.\n“We have a unique window of opportunity to make school choice a reality” for millions for families, she said.\nREAD MORE: A day at CPAC, where fringe meets the establishment GOP \n  CPAC Mike Pence PREVIOUS POST U.S. will continue use of privately run prisons, Attorney General says NEXT POST Factory jobs exist, CEOS tell Trump.
