Back to basics? \nWith Wayne Rooney out the team with illness, Mourinho played a 4-4-2 against Leicester. \nThat involved having Henrikh Mkhitaryan down one flank and Juan Mata down the other, with Paul Pogba and Ander Herrera in the centre. \nWas it a coincidence the match started at such a terrible pace? \nAfter 20 plus minutes of the Match, Mourinho scrapped his odd tactical choice. \nIn fairness to the Special One, once he reverted to a 4-5-1 formation Man United closed the half with two goals.
