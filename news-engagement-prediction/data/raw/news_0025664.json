Thomas Kidd is devastated after losing his toy \nShe has also shared a video of Thomas visibly distraught while on holiday because he is missing ‘Horsey’. \nAnne, of Leyland, Lancashire, said: “Thomas has had Horsey since he was born. Being autistic, he hasn’t developed usual relationships. \n“That’s why Horsey was so very special, Thomas really had a very special relationship with Horsey. He slept on him every night and was an extension to his arm during the day. Read More \n“When needing to use his hand, Horsey would be tucked under his arm. He absolutely loved him and talked to him in his own babble language. \n“In truth Thomas showed the most affection to his Horsey more than people.” \nShe added: “We haven’t been able to take Thomas on a plane for six years, but I used to live in Germany and I very much wanted to meet up with my friends who we haven’t seen for so long with our whole family, including Thomas. This is why we were trying it out of season, when it was likely to be quieter.” \nAnyone who has seen the toy can contact the MEN newsdesk on 0161 211 2080 or email alexandra.rucki@trinitymirror.com. \nAlternatively send a tweet to @MENnewsdesk.
