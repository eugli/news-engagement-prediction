After an expensive offseason, the Dodgers reloaded in hopes of snapping their lengthy World Series drought. While the Chicago Cubs are the sport’s reigning champions,... (Andy McCullough) \n‘’When you add that to tickets for you and your family members, it’s an expensive day,’’ said Marcos, who owns California Heat AC & Heating in the San Fernando Valley. “That’s why you want to make sure you get the right woman, and I got the right woman.’’ \nRule No. 4: Stay in your seat. \nWhen the camera crew first approached Marcos’ section for the big moment, he was — what else? — standing in line buying beer. He had to chase them down and pop the question an inning later. \nRule No. 5: Watch out for the nachos. \nWhen Marin fell to his knees, he wasn’t preparing for the proposal. He was searching for the ring that he had nervously dropped. \n“I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, the ring is in the nachos,’’’ he said. “Belia is saying, ‘Get up, what are you doing?’ She had no idea.’’ \nBoth men eventually placed the ring on the finger of their surprised girlfriends, who became their fiancees as quickly as the couples became ballpark celebrities. \n“I was going back to the restroom,” Martin said, “and everyone is coming up to me, strangers, hugging me, buying me beer, saying, ‘Dude, you did it!’’’ \nRule No. 6: Don’t listen to the cynics. \nIt’s easy to grimace at these ballpark proposals — how could someone make such an intimate moment so public? — but the Dodger Stadium couples have a memory much bigger than just the two of them.
