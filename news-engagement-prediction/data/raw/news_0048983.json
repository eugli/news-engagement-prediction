A post shared by Kungahuset (@kungahuset) on Feb 19, 2017 at 11:28pm PST Princess Leonore of Sweden turned three on Monday \nGALLERY: The cutest royal youngsters \nMadeleine, 34, recently opened up about her son and daughter. During an engagement in London on Valentine's Day, where she opened the \"Room for Children\" at the Southbank Centre, Madeleine spoke about her children 's reading habits. \"Previously Leonore had not really had the patience, but now we read more and more books, which is great fun,\" Madeleine told Swedish news outlet Expressen . \"It is a cosy moment you have together. There will of course be Pippi in the beginning, but it has been mostly picture books until now.\" VIEW GALLERY The little Princess was the picture of cuteness \nAs for her son Nicolas, who turns two in June, she said: \"He has always loved books! So when you cannot find him, then he's sitting with a little book himself, up and down, like he was trying to look into it. It's very fun, so he will probably be a bookworm!\" \nThe royals live in London , where Chris' job is based, but regularly travel back to Sweden to see their family and to carry out engagements. They relocated to the English capital in August 2015, shortly after Nicolas was born. Businessman Chris has admitted that his three-year-old daughter can be a handful, while his son is a little softie. \"They are two different individuals,\" Chris told Expressen . \"Nicolas is a soft little guy. Leonore is dominant and a determined little girl.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:25:56.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
