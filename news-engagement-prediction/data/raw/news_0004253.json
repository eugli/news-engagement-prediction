In exchange, 11 charges were dropped, including three first-degree felony rape charges, according to local reports. \nShe was sentenced to at least two years and up to 30 years in prison, reports The Salt Lake Tribune . Her current scheduled release date is 2045, Johnson says. \nAltice was first arrested in October 2013 after one of her victims came forward to police. Brianne Altice Leah Hogsten/The Salt Lake Tribune/AP \nIn January, Altice went before the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole to ask for early release. As she discussed her past acts, Altice was occasionally in tears (as she was, repeatedly, during court appearances). \n“I clearly lost sight of all my values and my principles and was seeking inappropriate means to address my own issues, issues I’m very aware of now,” she said during the hearing. “This was my doing. This was no one else’s fault but my own. This was not my ex-husband’s fault, or the school’s fault, or my students’ fault. These were my poor, poor decisions. I’m very aware of it and I am very remorseful. I regret the decisions I made that brought us here.” \nDuring the parole hearing, Altice admitted to inappropriate sexual conduct with the victims, who were 16 and 17 at the time. She also acknowledged she’d had sex with one of them, a then 16-year-old student, in a church parking lot and during the school lunch hour. \n• Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

I wasn’t functioning in a healthy adult manner at all.” \nProsecutors said Altice’s crimes had a “really substantial impact” on her victims. \n“I think it was the sentiment in the public that this was any boy’s dream to have a relationship with an older woman like a teacher, and I didn’t see it that way because she impacted the lives of all three of these boys,” Davis County Deputy District Attorney Cristina Ortega told PEOPLE in a previous interview. \n• Pick up PEOPLE’s special edition True Crime Stories: Cases That Shocked America , on sale now , for the latest on Casey Anthony, JonBenét Ramsey and more. \n“I think she took advantage of each of the boys and what issues they may have had, whether it was their family or drugs or that sort of thing,” Ortega said. “I think she took advantage of that and she made their problems even worse. And on top of that, they had to deal with the public scrutiny of a lot of people saying, ‘You are not a victim because you are a boy.’ I think she layered on the impact with these boys.” Show Full Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:51:13.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
