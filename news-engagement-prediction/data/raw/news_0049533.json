'He has had a couple of small injuries this season and needs to adapt. He knows what I like in a defender, he knows that I like stability, that I don't like mistakes, that for me it is to trust a player totally and he has to work to get it. Shaw has endured a difficult campaign and suffered a nasty injury against PSV 'And when he is on the pitch again he has to try to give me that step by step because he is still only a young player. Sometimes people forget he is only a young player with a lot to learn but I like the player and I like the boy.' Asked directly if Shaw would be at Old Trafford for the long haul, the United manager replied: 'He will be here for sure. It (leaving) is out of the question.' Shaw won the last of his six England caps 18 months ago and has not been involved in United's last four games since their previous FA Cup tie against Wigan. Mourinho said that people need to realise Shaw is still young with plenty to learn in the game RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:03:03.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
