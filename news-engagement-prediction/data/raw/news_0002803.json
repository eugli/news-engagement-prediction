Instead, he served notice that he would oppose plans to curb immigration. Mr Osborne said the Government had chosen ‘not to make the economy the priority in this negotiation, they have prioritised immigration control’. John Longworth, pictured, former head of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the former chancellor was 'wrong' to say the Government was 'not prioritising the economy' He predicted there would be ‘lively debate’ in Parliament in the coming years on issues such as immigration, state aid and agricultural policy, adding: ‘I will be in those fights in the couple of years ahead.’ FOX: I'M NOT POINTLESS Liam Fox yesterday demanded an apology from former Civil Service chief Lord O’Donnell over claims that the department he leads is pointless. The International Trade Secretary is in charge of striking free trade deals for a post-Brexit Britain – and said he was already in talks with Australia, China, India, New Zealand, South Korea, Turkey and the Gulf States. Lord O’Donnell, together with Sir Andrew Cahn, the former head of UK Trade and Investment, which was replaced by Dr Fox’s department, have said there was no need for a separate department. But Dr Fox angrily dismissed the suggestion his department, created last summer, is irrelevant because it cannot agree trade deals before Britain leaves the EU. He told the Commons trade committee: ‘They’re very welcome to come in and share in the workload, and I think they can start by apologising to my hardworking staff.’ He said he would vote for Article 50 because for MPs to do otherwise would risk ‘putting Parliament against people’ and provoking a ‘deep constitutional crisis’. John Longworth, former head of the British Chambers of Commerce, accused Mr Osborne of ‘sniping and sneering’ at a Brexit result he had done everything to prevent. Mr Longworth, now co-chairman of the Leave Means Leave group, said the former Chancellor was ‘wrong’ to say the Government was not prioritising the economy. He added: ‘After a swift, clean break from the EU, Britain can become the best country in the world in which to do business. ‘Only by leaving can we crystallise the economic benefits of Brexit. The former Chancellor should be embracing these benefits instead of sniping and sneering at the democratic will of the people.’ Mr Osborne said he was ‘saddened’ by Brexit. And he suggested that negotiations with the EU would be ‘bitter’. He also claimed the EU’s priority will be to ‘maintain the integrity of the remaining 27 members of the European Union’, adding: ‘They are not interested in a long and complex hybrid agreement with the United Kingdom and so therefore both sides at the moment are heading for a clean break from the European Union for the United Kingdom.’ Downing Street said: ‘The former Chancellor speaks for himself.’ Share or comment on this article 41", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T09:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:17:13.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
