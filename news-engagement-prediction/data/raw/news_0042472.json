They won the title after they underwent an intense selection process in which 200 teenagers countrywide took part.The awards were sponsored by Candy and Candy and Beyond Marketing. The first auditions were held in mid-December last year at Vision Plaza, Mombasa Road. Through those auditions, twenty outstanding contestants were selected to proceed to the final stage. The major event, in which the two were crowned was held at Bluesprings Hotel in Garden City. Parents of the contestants attended the event among other renowned guests. Benson Kimotho is a first-year student at JKUAT pursuing an undergraduate degree in Information Technology. He began his modeling career in 2015 immediately after clearing high school. He now works for Tianar Modelling Agency where he hopes to perfect his talent. Within a short period of time, his career seems to take a better shape as he was crowned the first runners up of Agape award which was held in October last year. When he was asked whether he had expected to win, he said that he was confident of winning.“After the first auditions, I emerged the top under the boys’ category. I was, therefore, confident I could win this, and I did,” he said.Benson hopes to establish his name in the modeling industry such that he doesn’t have to be auditioned before getting a chance with a particular agency. To all teens who aspire to become models, he advises, “Most teens expect to shine, earn and get real cash when they join modeling. “However, that is not the case. You will have to struggle, get connections before you can finally succeed,” he added.On the other hand Yvonne Wangari cleared high school last year and is set to join campus this year.The winners walked away with brand new laptops and smartphones. They also had their whole term’s school fees paid. Besides that, they were promised to be enrolled into an international modeling agency in the United Kingdom. The enrolment will certainly further their modeling careers. This is a citizen journalism website. The views expressed here do not represent that of the Standard Group Ltd.
