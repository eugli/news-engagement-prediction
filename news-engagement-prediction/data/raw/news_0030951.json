(Steven Senne/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   8:29 PM \nMajor U.S. department retailers Sears and Kmart removed 31 Trump Home products from their online stores, a spokesman said. \n\"As part of the company’s initiative to optimize its online product assortment, we constantly refine that assortment to focus on our most profitable items,\" Sears Holdings Corporation spokesman Brian Hanover told Reuters in a statement, adding that neither Sears nor Kmart carries Trump Home products in-house. \nThe Trump Home collection, which is owned by the Trump Organization, includes furniture, bedding, lighting, mirrors and chandeliers, according to its website . President Trump, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, defended her on Twitter after Nordstrom decided to part ways with the Trump brand. (Evan Vucci/AP) \nNeither Sears Holdings Corporation — which oversees Kmart — nor the Trump Organization immediately responded to requests for comment. \nThe decision comes after Nordstrom decided to part ways with Ivanka Trump’s line due in part because of declining sales, prompting President Trump to say on Twitter that his daughter has been “ treated so unfairly .” A Sears spokesman said the company stopped selling Trump Home items on its online stores. (Tim Boyle/Getty Images) \nNordstrom sales of Ivanka’s line “fell by nearly one-third in the past fiscal year, with sharp drops in sales weeks before her father Donald Trump was elected president,” the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday. \nNieman Marcus dropped Trump’s jewelry line last weekend. TJ Maxx and Marshalls have also distanced themselves from the Trump brand amid a growing #GrabYourWallet campaign urging customers to boycott the Trump brand. Ivanka Trump’s brand high heels are on sale in the clearance section at a Century 21 department store.

Elijah Cummings (D-M.D.) and House Committee Oversite Chair Jason Chaffetz co-wrote a letter to the Office of Government Ethics Thursday, requesting the agency investigate Conway's comments.
