Occasionally, new information arises that shows some vitamins to be of greater consequence than previously thought, often because they deal with crucial functions throughout your body. \nThat’s true with vitamin B12, not only because it directly influences metabolism in every one of your cells throughout your brain and nervous system , as it regulates and synthesizes DNA and how your blood is formed, but because of new findings that suggest vitamin B12 may be far more important to microbial life than previously thought. \nThe evidence, revealed by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, shows that vitamin B12, also called cobalamin, may in fact play a “pivotal” role in cell growth and coordination of cells in complex multicellular systems. \nThe study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), reported two “unexpected discoveries” as a result of their research. 1 One publication noted that while B12 is produced by a mere few organisms, it’s required by nearly all of them and, as such, holds a lot of clout. \nChemist Aaron Wright and his team studied a microbial “mat” taken from Hot Lake in Washington state. EurekAlert described it as a “community” of microbe layers with lots of members “living together and trading nutrients like carbon and oxygen in hot, salty water, thick with growth of algae and other micro-organisms.” 2 Probing Vitamin B12’s Influence on Crucial Functions \nWright noted the enormous amount of energy required for a microbe to synthesize the 30 biochemical steps in the process of making B12, “signifying that the substance is highly valuable and carries out important functions.” 3 \nAccording to EurekAlert, 4 Wright’s team made a chemical mock-up B12 to work just like the original, but which offers greater options for scientists to track living cells. \nThey used affinity-based protein profiling to tag molecules that are most active, and a technique called mass spectrometry to determine which proteins held the most interest. New Hope Network noted: \n“Wright’s team found that B12 interacts with 41 different proteins in the bacterium, and … is central to the regulation of folate, ubiquinone, and methionine — substances crucial to the ability of microbial cells to create energy, build proteins, repair DNA and grow. \nThe findings about methionine show an expanded influence of B12 compared to what has been known. The vitamin also changes the instructions it sends to genes depending on whether it's day or night — not a surprise in a community of organisms for which light is a central driver.” 5 \nScientists have probed the role of B12 in genes, and enzymatic microbes involved in DNA and protein development, for years, but two more scientists, Andrew Goodman at Yale and Michiko Taga at University of California at Berkeley, also previously disclosed even more functions of this vitamin. The Importance of Vitamin B12 in Your Diet \nVitamin B12 is connected to the proteins in food. Once it’s consumed, the hydrochloric acid in your stomach separates out the B12, which then combines with a compound known as intrinsic factor so it can be absorbed by your intestines. \nNew cell production and maintenance, as well as DNA synthesis, makes vitamin B12 vital for health. \nLeft unattended, low vitamin B12 levels could result in neurological problems or inefficient blood cell production. One indication is a “pins and needles” sensation resembling electric shock waves due to low oxygen levels. Other symptoms include: 6 \n✓ Dizziness", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:19:43.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
