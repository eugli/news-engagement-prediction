There was a time we thought we weren't going to get an inquest,\" she said. \n\"This is our best chance that we've been given to explore what did happen to Jarrod under the water. \n\"We will learn what they did do and what they perhaps should have done, and what maybe should have been in place.\" \nMs Hampton said the doubt surrounding just how her son died had added to the family's distress. \n\"We only live with the memories of him, and we miss him, and the dynamics of our family have changed forever ... we're overwhelmed by his loss,\" she said.

(ABC TV: Four Corners) \nThe Broome District Court heard it took the Paspaley crew between five and 10 minutes to bring Mr Hampton onto a boat, at which time efforts to revive him were unsuccessful. \nHowever, no charge was ever laid relation to Mr Hampton's death, and there has been no suggestion the company was responsible. \nThe Hampton family has been scathing of the relatively loose regulation of the pearling industry and the lack of change in the wake of their son's death. \n\"There's been no significant improvements, nothing done that would protect someone's life,\" Ms Hampton said. \nPearl diving is regulated under the general diving regulations rather than commercial diving regulations, and Ms Hampton said the inquest would provide an opportunity to have that reviewed. \n\"It's not as safety conscious as the recreational diving regulations, nor does it even come close to commercial diving,\" she said. \n\"All the pearl divers must get a commercial fishing licence, so the WA state does see their job as commercial fishing, and yet they've managed to maintain a very archaic diving regulation, the general diving regulations.\" Review underway but progress unclear \nBoth Paspaley and the WA Pearl Producers Association have defended the industry's safety record, pointing out that deaths are very rare and saying improvements had been made in recent years. \nThe State Government said in the wake of Mr Hampton's death that it would review safety regulations, but it appears there has been little progress. \nA working group was formed by WorkSafe after court proceedings finished in 2015 to assess what industry changes were needed. \nThe ABC understands the group has met several times, and is looking at whether the existing non-enforceable industry code of practice needs to be upgraded to a commission code. \nDiving guidelines are also being reviewed nationally, a process Worksafe has said could have implications for the training requirements in WA's pearling industry. \nThe WA Pearl Producers Association and WorkSafe have been contacted for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:37:26.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
