For those who don’t follow the comics (or for those who do but still don’t give a shit about the Inhumans), Maximus is the genius brother of Inhuman King Black Bolt, and though he’s extremely devoted to helping his people, he’s also extremely devoted to killing his brother and taking the Inhuman kingdom of Attilan for himself. He may not be as much of an asshole as Rheon’s Ramsay Bolton, but that’s only because nobody else in any universe could be that much of an asshole. \nMarvel quietly announced the Inhumans TV show back in November , apparently ending plans for the previously announced Inhumans movie in the process. Also, though Inhuman characters have played a big role on ABC’s Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. , this show will be a totally separate thing and not a spin-off of that series. Its premiere episode will debut in IMAX theaters this summer, and the show itself is set to debut on ABC in the fall. \nThe other major roles in Marvel’s Inhumans —specifically Black Bolt, Inhuman Queen Medusa, and giant, teleporting dog Lockjaw—have not been cast. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:22:24.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
