Ad Feedback \nThe technique used dogs to detain a pig by biting its ears until a hunter arrived and killed it, sparing the more valuable meat. \nUnder the Animal Cruelty Act, wilfully ill-treating an animal was illegal except when hunting, until the change in 2015 removed the hunting exclusion. \nBecause the video was shot in 2014, Judge Morris \"reluctantly\" dismissed the charges because causing an animal unnecessary pain or distress while hunting was not illegal yet. \n\"Pig hunting is not ideal for the faint hearted nor people of the animal rights movement,\" she said. \nThe case was a warning to hunters that causing unnecessary distress to an animal was now considered animal cruelty, even if it was while hunting, she said. \n\"If hunters wish to train their dogs on live pigs they will have to do so with great care so as not to commit a criminal offence. \n\"Mr Thwaites and Mr Johnson can no longer, in my view, train dogs in this fashion because they are at grave risk of a judge finding that the pig suffered unreasonable pain and distress.\" \nTraining dogs to hold a pig could land hunters up to 12 months in jail or $50,000 in fines if it caused the pig unnecessary distress. \nDefence lawyer Rob Harrison said pig hunters used the hunt to feed their families, and training dogs was more difficult when a hunter had to kill a pig immediately. \nBut the real lesson from the case was not to post videos online, he said. \n\"Just leave the video cameras at home.\" - The Marlborough Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:02:42.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
