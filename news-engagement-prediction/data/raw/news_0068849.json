Not to be upstaged, though, was Aguero, whose future may be in doubt following the arrival of Gabriel Jesus but who remains an excellent bet for a goal when required. His first may have been fortuitous but his second was a sweetly struck volley that got his team back in the tie. Falcao scored a fantastic goal which drew Monaco level at 3-3 at one stage during a fascinating encounter Caballero still struggling with his feet \nT he pass Willy Caballero tried and failed to play out to Fernandinho on the left touchline in the lead up to Monaco’s first equaliser was one City’s coaching staff had the goalkeeper practising as far back as the club’s pre-season tour of China last July. Willy Caballero was at fault for Monaco's equaliser \nH e struggled with it then and eight months working with Pep Guardiola seem to have done little to improve the Argentine’s distribution in that regard. The irony is that in those training sessions in Beijing, Joe Hart proved so much more adept than Caballero at hitting his intended target but will Guardiola ever admit he was wrong to jettison the England No. 1 so prematurely? \nClaudio Bravo’s failure to adapt to English football has resulted in Guardiola having to turn to Hart’s long-standing understudy, but while Caballero managed to save Radamel Falcao's feeble penalty and deny the Colombian late on, it is hard to argue that the Catalan has made anything but a mess of the goalkeeping situation at the Etihad Stadium. Watch | Manchester City vs Monaco - key match stats 01:02 Stones' defending for Falcao chip was lame \nI t is not just the frequency of the mistakes Nicolas Otamendi and John Stones make, it is the nature of them and to think the pair cost a combined £80 million. \nCity’s coaching staff fret about the positioning of some of the young defenders on the periphery of the first team and cite it as a reason behind their wait for promotion but how can they adopt such a stance when one of the club’s most experienced centre-halves operates, to borrow Gary Neville’s description, as if controlled by a 10-year-old on a PlayStation? John Stones was brushed aside for Falcao's second but then tapped home at the other end \nO tamendi’s failure to spot Kylian Mbappe’s run and inability to cut out the danger before the Monaco winger waltzed through was shocking to witness, just as his lazy positioning forced him to make one of those familiar reckless lunges from which he conceded a penalty that Falcao could not convert. Stones may be suffering for playing alongside Otamendi but that should not disguise the England centre-back’s own failings and his habitually reticent defending. The ease with which Falcao evaded him for Monaco’s third goal was lame. In the background, Otamendi had stopped his run when he should have darted in behind to cover Stones. Man of the match - Leroy Sane \nThere were so many contenders for the title it almost seems unfair to single out one individual. \nDavid Silva excelled in central midfield for City and Monaco’s teenage wonderkid Kylian Mbappe looks a star in the making. But on a night when the sheer bravado, exuberance and fearlessness of youth was a joy to behold, Sane’s contribution was central to City eventually emerging on top at the end of one of the great Champions League nights. \nGuardiola claims he has not seen too many youngsters attack defenders with such verve and that was in full evidence for the opening goal when Sane wriggled past three markers, fed Silva, collected the return ball with a beautifully quick repositioning of his feet and laying the ball across for Raheem Sterling to tap home. And it was Sane who timed his run perfectly to latch on to Silva’s pass and claim a vital fifth goal for City. Leroy Sane added City's fifth What Monaco need to work on this week \nL eonardo Jardim and his Monaco players will need a lie down first and only in the days to come will they be able to digest how they could ask so many questions of City and yet still emerge 5-3 losers. The tie may remain alive and kicking but they will have to defend much better if they are to come from behind and goalkeeper Danijel Subasic, guilty of an awful error for Aguero’s first goal, must work on his handling.
