Photo: Tamara Dean \n\"If the consumer backdrop is difficult, if there's a change in consumer sentiment or unexpected weather events, domestic apparel retailers are punished so much more because these other global competitors have advantages of scale,\" Mr Cousins said. \n\"There's this recalibration of market share, where domestic players that are strong can survive and prosper but those brands that are not 'match fit' are getting caught out.\" \nMr Cousins said the supply chain operations behind these big international brands made them agile and able to respond quickly to sales trends. High-tech stock management \nZara gets two stock drops a week and it tracks every garment through radio frequency identification technology, which means the business can follow an item of clothing from its logistics platform to its sale and understand in real time how much stock and what sizes are in every store. \nRetail analyst Steve Kulmar said Zara was a world leader in supply chain technology and it leveraged this data to sell off unpopular lines and quickly restock stores with new or wanted products. \nHe said the average domestic apparel retailer in Australia worked on about one major stock delivery a month and as a consequence was slow to react to sales trends and too reliant on discounting. \nMr Kulmar said risk-averse domestic retailers had become timid with their design and collections and lost their sense of identify and connection with their customers along the way. \nThe frequency of sales and deep discounting at specialty apparel chains in Australia has normalised the lower prices and shoppers now expect reductions all the time. \nCiti analyst Bryan Raymond said apparel retailers now ran promotions longer and often with deeper discounts but he said the growing popularity of international sales events was also influencing local retailers. \n\"If you wind the clock back five years or more, you would have seen some discounting in mid to late December if retailers were nervous they weren't going to hit their numbers,\" Mr Raymond said. \n\"Now we've progressed to a longer period of discounting in December as well as the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, which are in November and getting bigger each year. \n\"Next we will have Singles Day from China in early November, so there are these rolling global promotional cycles which aren't helping.\" Price battles futile \nZara's sales in Australia have retreated from their initial \"elevated levels\", according to Macquarie Wealth Management, but along with Japanese giant Uniqlo and H&M these three brands captured $600 million in Australian apparel sales last year. \nMacquarie reports that margins are under pressure at all three of the international chains, but they're still driving sales growth through new store openings and squeezing domestic chains out of the market. \nUltimately, these large, international brands have the financial fire-power to hollow out Australia's apparel sector. And cutting prices is not the answer, according to Christoph Petzoldt managing director of pricing consultancy Simon Kucher & Partners. \nHe said trying to fight Zara or H&M on price was ultimately futile and exacerbated the challenges facing local apparel operations. But shoppers also had a role to play. \n\"Consumers have to consider whether in ten years' time they only want to shop at stores like H&M, or whether they would prefer to have local brands as well,\" Mr Petzoldt said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:06:24.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
