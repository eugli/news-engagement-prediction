The 76ers were reportedly in talks with the Chicago Bulls on Thursday for a deal involving Okafor. \nThe 76ers had to clear up their logjam of big men. Okafor and Noel had both expressed displeasure with their limited roles as Joel Embiid became the future of the 76ers with surprisingly strong early-season play. Noel's athleticism and ability to protect the rim could be a good fit for the Mavericks, who sorely need a defensive-minded center to pair with Dirk Nowitzki. \nThe 76ers remain half in \"The Process\" mode. The motivation for such a trade, besides clearing up the rotation, is to get back a draft pick (though it may not happen this year since the Mavs are unlikely to make the playoffs). On Wednesday, the 76ers also traded for Tiago Splitter from the Atlanta Hawks, taking on two second-round picks in the meantime. \nSlowly, but surely, the 76ers are being molded into a real NBA team with clearer path.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:49:56.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
