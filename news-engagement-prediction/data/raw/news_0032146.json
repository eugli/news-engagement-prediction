Millennials £2,700,000,000,000 worse off because of previous generation’s decisions \nThe supermarket chain has started a six week trial where the automatic doors will stay open, music will be switched off, lights will be dimmed, there will be no staff stacking shelves and no tannoy announcements. \nAt the moment, it’s happening between 9am and 10am on Saturdays at a store in Crawley, West Sussex, but could be rolled out to more shops if it proves a success. \nJo-Ann D’Costa Manuel, whose youngest child, 8, has autism, does her weekly shop there and it was her idea to make some adjustments during the hour. \n‘Tesco shopping was always an impossible experience for us due to the sensory overload and lack of public awareness,’ she said. \n\n‘I have joined forces with Tesco to introduce a weekly Quiet Hour to make the shopping experience more accessible to adults, children and families living with autism. \nLesbian couple 'asked to leave McDonald's after they kissed on the cheek' ‘Creating public autism awareness is also at the core of this service.’ \nShe said that she is now able to enjoy her family shopping trips thanks to the changes in place. Changes during Quiet Hour \n• Doors at entrance left open \n• Quiet Hour signs placed around the store \n• In store music turned off \n• Escalators at the back of the store turned off \n• No staff packing shelves ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:39:47.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
