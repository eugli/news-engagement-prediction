That’s it. What is M-103 NOT? \nREAD MORE: Conservatives supported ‘condemning all forms of Islamophobia’ in October \nThere is no requirement for the prime minister or his cabinet to take any action based on M-103, even if it passes and the Heritage committee issues recommendations. \nThe motion will not place any new legal restrictions on freedom of speech. It has no power to change Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms or any other law. Anyone who wishes to denounce Islam or Muslims publicly can still do so if this motion passes. \nWATCH: “We will burn down your mosques” MP reads threats following motion \nHate speech is still a crime in Canada, however. M-103 has no affect whatsoever on the Criminal Code’s provisions related to hate speech and inciting hatred, which remain in effect with or without it. Why is it so controversial? \nOne word: Islamophobia. Critics of the motion point out that M-103 asks the House to “condemn Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination” without defining what “Islamophobia” actually means. \nConservative MPs have argued that condemning “Islamophobia” without providing that context could stifle legitimate debate about controversial issues like sharia law and the niqab. \nWATCH: Conservatives politicizing motion to tackle Islamophobia: Liberals \nIn addition, by pulling one religion out of the list and mentioning it by name, then simply lumping the rest under “religious discrimination,” critics like Conservative leadership candidate Kellie Leitch have suggested that the motion is singling out Islam for “special treatment.” (Previous motions before the House have singled out individual religions in a similar manner, for instance by asking MPs to condemn anti-Semitism.) \nIt’s not just Conservatives crying foul. Even former Liberal minister Irwin Cotler has said the wording should be tweaked to ensure broad support. \nThe government argues that critics are playing politics with what should be an easy motion to get through the House. Now what? \nThe House debated the motion on Wednesday this week. The Conservatives tried tabling a similar motion on Thursday, taking out the reference to Islamophobia, to no avail. \nIt could be April before the motion actually moves to a vote. \nWhen it happens, it is expected to be a free vote, meaning each MP can vote for or against it according to their personal preference. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
