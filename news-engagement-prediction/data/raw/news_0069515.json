Photo: Bradley Kanaris \nThe hits have been fuelled by soaring petrol prices, with ACCC's ninth quarterly report on the national petroleum industry showing the December quarter in 2016 had the highest quarterly average price since the June quarter in the previous year. \nIt shows that prices in the five largest cities increased by 7.8 cents per litre to 122.0 cents per litre. \nIn addition, gross retail margins, that is, the difference between retail prices and wholesale prices, increased by 0.9 cents per litre to 11.3 cents per litre. Average gross retail margins in the five largest cities in the 2016 calendar year were 10.6 cents per litre, which was marginally higher than in 2015. \n\"Average retail prices in the December quarter 2016 in the largest cities were the highest since the June quarter 2015, while gross retail margins also increased in the quarter,\" says Mr Sims. \nThe increase in retail prices during the quarter was significantly influenced by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) announcement in November that its members had agreed to limit crude oil production. \nThe OPEC cartel announced an additional agreement in December with 11 non-OPEC countries to reduce production further. \n\"International crude oil and refined petrol prices increased because of the OPEC cartel's decision to restrict oil supply,\" says Mr Sims. \n\"Cartel conduct leads to higher prices and economic harm and, in this case, it has meant higher prices at the pump for Australian motorists,\" he says. \n\"In this higher price environment it is even more important for motorists to shop around for cheaper petrol prices.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:33:33.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
