The offense, or the team with control of the ball, attempts to advance the ball downfield by running or passing the ball, while the opposing team aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball themselves. The object of the game is to simply outscore your opponent. This is accomplished by advancing the football upfield and scoring as many touchdowns, or field goals as possible, while holding the other team to as few as possible. The Field \nThe football field is 100 yards longs. It has stripes running across the field at five-yard intervals. There are also shorter lines, called hash marks, marking each single yard interval down the field. On each end of the 100-yard field is an end zone, which extends ten yards. Thus, with the end zones included, the field is 120 yards long and 160 feet wide. The spot where the end zone meet the actual playing field is referred to as the goal line. The yardage from the goal line is marked at ten-yard intervals, up to the 50-yard line, which is in the center of the field. After reaching the 50-yard line, the yardage markers start to descend (40, 30, 20, 10) every ten yards until they reach the opposite goal line. Teams \nFootball features two teams playing against each other. Each team is allowed to have eleven men on the field at any given time. More than 11 players on the field results in a penalty. Unlimited substitution is permitted, but players can only enter the field when the ball is dead and play is stopped. Each team is comprised of an offense , defense , and a special teams. If team A has possession of the ball, they use their offensive team to attempt to advance the ball toward the opponentâ€™s end zone. If team B has the ball, team A will use their defensive team to attempt to stop team B from advancing the ball. If a kicking play is expected, both teams will use their special teams. Object of the Game \nThe object of the game is to simply outscore your opponent. This is accomplished by advancing the football upfield and scoring as many touchdowns, or field goals as possible, while holding the other team to as few as possible. Beginning of the Game \nBefore each game, the captains from each team and the referee meet at the center of the field for the coin toss.The winner of the coin toss has the option of starting the game by kicking the ball to the other team or receiving the kickoff from the other team. The game begins when one of the teams kicks off to the other. The receiving team must catch the ball and try to advance it as far back toward the kicking team as possible.The play ends when the player with the ball is knocked to the ground (tackled), or makes it all the way to the kicking team's endzone The spot where the kick returner was tackled becomes the line of scrimmage. The line of scrimmage is a term for the place the ball is spotted before a play is run.Once this starting point is established, the offensive squad of the receiving team will come in and try to move the ball toward the opposition's end zone. Methods of Scoring \nThe biggest goal for an offense every time they take possession of the ball is to score a touchdown. To score a touchdown, a player must carry the ball across the opposition's goal line, or catch a pass in the end zone. Once the ball crosses the plane of the goal line while it is in a player's possession, it is scored a touchdown. A touchdown is worth six points. The team scoring a touchdown is given the bonus of trying to add one or two more points. These are called extra point conversion attempts. \nIf a team elects to go for two extra points, they will line up at the two-yard line and make one attempt at either running or passing the ball into the end zone. If they make it, they are awarded two points. If they don't, they get no extra points. They can also elect to go for just one extra point by kicking the ball through the goal posts while snapping it from the fifteen-yard line. \nAnother way for a team to score is by kicking a field goal. When a team finds themselves in a fourth-down situation, many times they will attempt to kick a field goal if they feel they are close enough for their kicker to kick the football between the upright bars of the goal post in the opponent's end zone. A field goal is worth three points. A team can also pick up two points by tackling an opponent possessing the ball in his own end zone. This is called a safety.
