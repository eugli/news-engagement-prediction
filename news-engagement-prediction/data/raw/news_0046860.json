All three come together in the video for \"God, Your Mama and Me,\" FGL's collaborative single with Nineties heroes the Backstreet Boys. Related Backstreet Boys to Donald Trump: Stop Playing 'I Want It That Way' Boy band objects to GOP candidate's inclusion of chart-topping pop song at rallies \nThe song hinges on one of those alternately sweet and eyebrow-raising couplets, mixing the Backstreet Boys' rich harmonies into the assurance, \" You know I'm always gonna be here for ya / No one's ever gonna love you more than / God, your mama, and me .\" Fittingly, the TK McKamy-directed video combines homemade movies of all seven and their families, along with a beachside performance filmed in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida. \n\"It was a beautiful night, [we] got some cool sunset shots,\" says FGL's Brian Kelley of the experience. \nKelley and singing partner Tyler Hubbard have long professed their fandom of the Backstreet Boys, even covering one of their biggest hits in concert. As the pop group – Nick Carter, Kevin Richardson, Brian Littrell, Howie Durough and AJ McLean – enjoyed massive commercial success despite themselves being a polarizing presence in the second half of the Nineties, they've proven to be a good example to FGL for weathering and surviving the uncertain ever-shifting climate of the music industry. \n\"These guys are professionals, they take their job really serious and they also take their relationships with each other really serious,\" says Hubbard. \"I would imagine it's not always easy. Those guys are brothers, they're really, really tight through the ups and downs. It's really cool to see.\" \nHubbard and Kelley were recently nominated for five ACM Awards, including Entertainer of the Year and Album of the Year for Dig Your Roots . Currently, they're headlining their Dig Your Roots Tour with guests Dustin Lynch and Chris Lane. Meanwhile, Backstreet Boys released their album A World Like This in 2013. On March 1st, they'll begin headlining their Las Vegas residency, Backstreet Boys: Larger Than Life .
