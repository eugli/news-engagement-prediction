(DIMITRIS MICHALAKIS/REUTERS) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday, February 24, 2017, 5:17 PM \nSome of the people in charge of implementing President Trump’s travel ban have disputed that people from the seven countries targeted in his executive order pose any particular threat to the U.S. \nA Department of Homeland Security draft intelligence report seen by the Associated Press says that citizenship in the countries is “unlikely indicator” that someone could carry out a terrorist attack. \nTrump’s January order, currently stayed by a federal court in Seattle, was titled “protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States.” \nAmong its most controversial sections was a 90-day ban on issuing visas or allowing citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen to enter the country. \nNYPD top cop says doing right by immigrants trumps fed funding \nCommenting on the leaked intelligence report Friday, DHS spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said, “While DHS was asked to draft a comprehensive report on this issue, the document you’re referencing was commentary from a single intelligence source versus an official, robust document with thorough interagency sourcing.” Opponents have questioned why Trump selected Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for his ban. (JONATHAN ERNST/REUTERS) \nBeyond criticism that the order violates the freedom of religion by acting as a “Muslim ban,” opponents also pointed the fact that the ban skipped countries such as Saudi Arabia, home to most of the 9/11 hijackers. \nOthers noted that the ban avoided Muslim-majority countries where Trump has business dealings, such as Egypt and Turkey. \nAfter the original order was blocked, Trump has said that new executive action is being drafted and could be announced soon.
