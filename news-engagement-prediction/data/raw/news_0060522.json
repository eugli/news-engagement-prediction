A study in 2010 about how the weather affects sales at a retail store found that as exposure to sunlight increased, consumer spending tended to increase. “In general terms, pleasant weather puts us in a better mood,” Dr. Mehta said. The inverse can also true, she said: “If a person goes into a store and evaluates a product on a day that’s not as nice, the evaluation won’t be as positive.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story It may elevate our mood. Participants in a 2008 study in Germany kept a daily journal of their well-being , while data from nearby weather stations was collected. The researchers found that some negative moods decreased with sunlight and better weather. “What’s really interesting here,” Dr. Mehta said, “is that the researchers found that not only sunlight, but weather conditions like wind, can affect your mood as well.” It may put us in the mood for love. In a 2013 study, a 20-year-old male research assistant stopped unaccompanied young women , chatted with them and asked for their telephone numbers during sunny or cloudy weather. The women were more likely to give their numbers on a sunny day, the findings showed. “It lends some evidence that ‘spring flings’ or ‘spring fever’ could be a real thing,” she said. “Of course,” she added, “with all of these studies, we would need more evidence to prove their findings.” Can nice weather make us leave our apartments and be more productive? “Well, when the weather is good, people are out and excited to be outside. We don’t know if good weather is getting people outside, and that in turn is putting them in a better mood,” Dr. Mehta said. But she added that a growing body of research suggests that being outdoors and close to nature affects people positively. So, in light of all this research, allow us to reach a simple conclusion: Get outside. It’s going to be 68 and sunny .
