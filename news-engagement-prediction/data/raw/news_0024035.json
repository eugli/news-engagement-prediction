Traps must be staked down and must identify the trapper by name. Setting traps illegally can result in criminal charges. A nest with a female eagle sitting on it has been found close by. If the eagle with the talon is a male and the female's mate is unlikely they will have a successful mating season The eagle has been seen in the area of Bonneauville, according to Looker and searchers did find an eagle nest about a half-mile away from where people reported seeing the bird of prey. A female is sitting on that nest, but it is not the bird with the trap on its legs, Looker said. If the distressed eagle is the mate of the female, the likelihood the pair will complete a successful nesting season at this point is low as both parents are needed to make a nest successful. Female eagles usually wait for a period of time for their male counterparts but won't endanger its own health in the process. 'She's not going to be dumb enough to sit there and starve to death,' Looker said. 'She'll eventually leave.' Without intervention the eagle will probably die as it won't be able to hunt nor eat Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T15:48:47.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
