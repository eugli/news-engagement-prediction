It’s out March 31 via Century Media. The first offering from the release is a new video for the new song “No Lives Matter.” Watch it below via Loudwire . Bloodlust will include guests Dave Mustaine, Randy Blythe, and Max Cavalera. There is also a Slayer cover medley of “Raining Blood” and “Postmortem” on the album. \n“It’s unfortunate that we even have to say ‘Black Lives Matter.’” Ice-T says at the start of the video. “When you say ‘Black Lives Matter’ and then you say ‘All Lives Matter,’ that’s like if I were to say ‘Gay Lives Matter’ and you say ‘All Lives Matter,’ or I say ‘Women’s Lives Matter’ and you say ‘All Lives Matter.’ You’re diluting what I’m saying. You’re diluting the issue. The issue isn’t about everybody.” Artists In This Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:42:54.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
