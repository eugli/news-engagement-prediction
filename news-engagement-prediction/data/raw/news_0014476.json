It admitted as part of a plea deal with the US justice department to paying nearly $800m (£640m) in bribes to governments across Latin America. \nThey admitted paying $29m in Peru to secure contracts between 2005 and 2014. \nThat time spans the presidencies of Mr Toledo and his two successors in office, Alan Garcia and Ollanta Humala. His successors have also denied any wrongdoing.

I won't stand for this!\" \nInvestigators searched Mr Toledo's home for five hours on Saturday. The attorney general's office said documents found at the home would now be evaluated. \nMr Toledo was in France at the time of the search and said he was \"outraged by this political lynching coming from my traditional enemies\". \nThe current president of Peru, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, has urged Mr Toledo to return to Peru to face questioning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T10:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T06:10:43.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
