Far more than it took the driver to get to this point, unfortunately,” Toronto Transit Commission spokesman Brad Ross tweeted. \nTransit officials said shuttle buses are replacing the 509 Harbourfront and 510 Spadina streetcars operating on Front Street, Bay Street and Queens Quay. \nRoss said the driver of the SUV fled the scene. This will take some time to clear. Far more than it took the driver to get to this point, unfortunately. They fled, for the record. pic.twitter.com/hln4S4aSHw \n— Brad Ross (@bradTTC) February 23, 2017 \nThis isn’t the first time a vehicle has entered the tunnel. \nLast year, another SUV drove 600 metres into the exact same area. \nThe tunnel, which is located near the foot of Bay Street, occasionally gets the errant wrong-way vehicle. \nThe TTC has erected signs of the potential hazard but some have chosen to disregard the warning. \nVIDEO: Vehicle travels wrong way, gets stuck in TTC tunnel © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
