found Adelaide Olgun Uluc, FOX SPORTS February 16, 2017 10:15am \nTHE clock had just ticked past 1am. Jerome Randle was leaning on a bench, listening intently in a dimly-lit street in downtown Adelaide. The breeze was perfect, and the lights of a nearby realtor began to flicker as the man on the other side of the conversation, an NBA scout in town to see the hometown 36ers, continued to lecture the speedy point guard. \nThis was an encounter Randle has had many a time. The scout, repeating the sentiments of most who came before him, told Randle that he’s good enough to make the leap to the NBA, but that it would all come down to circumstance. Like clockwork, Randle responded with his signature confidence, “All I need is to get that opportunity, man.” \nThe conversation shifted toward current players in the league; the pair discussing Matthew Dellavedova’s unique pathway to the NBA and Isaiah Thomas’s rise to superstardom. \nRandle recalled another point guard, one who he lost contact with, but is now a dominant force in the NBA with the New Orleans Pelicans. Anthony Davis and Randle, who affectionately describes the forward as a ‘big, tall, lanky motherf***er’, have a long history together, spending time growing up in the same neighbourhood in the South Side of Chicago. When Randle lived with his uncle in Inglewood, he got used to seeing a ‘tall, lanky kid’ walking around the neighbourhood. The kid, who Randle remembers as a point guard, attended Visitation Catholic School on Garfield, and no-one had even an inkling of what he would become. \n“I lost contact with him,” Randle told foxsports.com.au , ”but I started seeing this Anthony Davis kid at Kentucky, and thought, ‘that’s the dude that used to be in the hood’.” \n“Damn, he really went to a whole another level. Out of sight, out of mind. When you saw him, there was so much love. We still keep in touch right now. He’s a good dude, man. Good-hearted dude. Everything he’s doing in the league, right now, he deserves.” \nThe pair still talk, to this day, Facetiming from time to time. While that might seem like an insignificant note, they’re both examples of athletes who ‘got out’ of the oppressive confines of arguably the United States’ most dangerous and under-resourced city. Davis was the rare case of a Chicago point guard who, by the time the NBA Draft came around, was the No. 1 overall pick... as a big-man. The 5’9 Randle wasn’t as lucky. \n*** \n“NO love” \nThat’s how Randle describes Chicago. It’s the city that made him, the city he loves, but, also, the city he doesn’t want to go back to. \n“It’s just very emotional, because you wanna go back to the city you came from, where everything started, but, then again, you don’t know if you might be one of those victims,” he said. \n“It’s tough for me to go back and show love to my city when my city don’t show love to each other.” \nWhen asked where exactly in Chicago he grew up, Randle couldn’t answer. His family moved from house to house when he was a child, living wherever they could afford. The first home Randle remembers is a small house on 104th and Wabash, in the Pullman area. It had just four rooms to house the 12 residents — extended members of Randle’s family — with Jerome, his mother, and siblings forced to sleep on the floor in the hallways. \nIt wasn’t long until an 11-year-old Randle and his family were kicked out of the house, forcing them to find shelter in a nearby church. The family slept on the floor again. \nTimes were tough for a young, “dead poor” family living in Chicago. Jerome’s mother, Zsa Zsa Miller, was a single parent, saving to buy her family a house, while trying to keep her children off the streets. After four months of living in the church, Miller saved up enough to buy a house of her own, and, while it was an opportunity to bring her family to a more comfortable, controlled environment, she soon discovered that finding solace in the city was more difficult than she first thought. \n“Literally, the first day we moved in the house, I was dribbling my basketball out the front, and I saw a group of guys down the street shooting dice,” Jerome Randle said. \n“I guess one of the guys must’ve won all the money... so another guy murdered him. I saw it, I was standing right there. It was, like, 12 guys. I saw a guy blow his brains out. That was the first time I’d seen something like that, that really scared me. Scarred me.” \nIt was the harsh reality of Randle’s environment, and one he was eager to avoid. As a teenager, the Randle family had a house in the suburbs, but Jerome would rarely spend any time there. A budding athlete, he would spend his days at Hales Franciscan High School on 49th and Cottage Grove, in the inner city. After school, he practised, then would often head to his uncle Lester’s home close by. \nHales is where Randle’s basketball journey officially began, with the school proving to be the breeding ground for the point guard’s eventual success in the sport. But he had fallen in love with the game much earlier, and thanks to one person. media_camera Jerome Randle. \nWhen the extended Randle family was living in their Pullman residence, ‘Chunk’— real name: Darrell Abrams — was among the ‘grandchildren’. Chunk taught Randle how to play basketball, taking him to courts to play pick-up, convincing friends to pass to his younger cousin, urging them, “Listen. Don’t be scared to pass him the ball. He’s really good.” \nThere was a snowy afternoon — a bleak -12 degrees (C) — and Chunk made Randle walk 20 blocks to the park with a shovel. It was Randle’s job to clear the entire court, bit by bit, just so they could play. Another flash that’s vivid in Randle’s mind is the time Chunk made him stand in the basement, making him dribble behind his back until he perfected it. \n“He was so hard on me, man,” Randle said. “He was so, so, so, tough on me, to the point where I didn’t like him. \n“He was teaching me. Teaching me how to dribble. Teaching me how to be aggressive and fearless. ‘Never be scared of someone taller than you’. He was the big brother I always wanted. My father wasn’t there, so I was seeking some type of attention for someone to help me, because basketball was everything to me. He taught me everything that I knew as a kid.” \nOne morning, when Randle was a sophomore in high school, he got the call. He was just beginning to think about his college prospects when he picked up the phone. His aunty was on the other side. She asked him where his mother was, and Randle jokingly told his aunt that his mother was in Minnesota, which was where Chunk happened to be. \nHis aunty’s response: “She’s in Minnesota, already?” \nConfusion began to set across the room, so Randle handed the phone to his mother, who quickly broke down in tears. \n“The story I heard was that Chunk hung himself,” Randle said. \n“It’s hard for me to believe that, after I talked to him just two days before. We were talking about college and what college we wanted to go to. To me, I didn’t look at him as someone who’d take his own life. I think something else happened that a lot of people didn’t wanna speak of. \n“They found him hanging from a closet with a belt hanging around his neck.” \n*** \nCHUNK never got a chance to see his little cousin dominate the court at Hales. \nRandle entered his senior year at the school as the No. 2 point guard in Chicago, with a commitment to California under his belt. He was among the headliners for the flurry of talent flowing through the city at the time, from Nate Minnoy, to the ‘fearless’ Mike Robertson, and Randle’s newest teammate at Hales, JaVale McGee. \nChicago has always been a pool of basketball talent, and it’s always accompanied by the passion and enthusiasm of the city. Over the past few years, it’s been Jahlil Okafor’s senior year at Whitney Young, Cliff Alexander’s dominant showing at Curie, and Marcus LoVett, Jr’s incredible showing at Morgan Park that has seen fans pack out gyms across the Windy City. \nBefore that, it was Randle’s Hales team, and no matchup was better or more anticipated than the one against his rival, the No. 1 point guard in the city, Sherron Collins. Their battles were fierce. Randle’s phone would be blowing up in the week leading up to the game against Collins’ Crane, with the then-senior receiving everything from trash-talk — people telling the 5’9 guard that Collins would ‘hit 40’ on him — to encouragement, to well wishes. The matchup was so anticipated, that it couldn’t be held in a regular high school gym. Instead, St. Xavier University’s gym was rented to host the showdown. \n“I always had so much respect for Sherron Collins,” Randle said. ”He was everything I wanted to be at the time. He had all the hype. Everybody around Chicago loved him. \n“He was getting recruited by all the big schools, so I actually envied him. Not in a bad way. He was it. \n“I knew that my ability was just as good, but I was at a smaller school. People were talking about him. He was a freshman playing on the varsity team. The respect that I had for him was second to none.” \nCollins didn’t end up ‘hitting 40’ in that game, but his 24 points overcame Randle’s 34-point effort, and resulted in a Crane win. Collins was a Kansas signee at the time, and went on to enjoy a successful career as a Jayhawk, while Randle did the same in the Pac-12, as a Golden Bear. \nThe pipeline of Chicago point guards is seemingly endless — Ricky Green, Glenn “Doc” Rivers, Derrick Rose, Maurice Cheeks, Isiah Thomas; the list goes on — and, Collins and Randle are part of that rich history. Part of the fraternity. \n*** \nPac-10 Player of the Year, First-team All-Pac-10, California’s all-time leading scorer, and leading the school to its first conference title in 50 years, Randle thought he’d done enough. The feedback coming from NBA teams was good, and his two agents were confident he’d hear his name called out on draft night. \nIt was the night of 2010 draft, and the first round flew by. \nThings moved on to the second round, where Randle was projected to be drafted, and also where he expected to be taken. \n“F***. This might not happen.” \nPick 57 went by, 58, 59, 60... nothing. \nThat moment was one filled with dejection; it was difficult for Randle to accept that he wasn’t good enough to be drafted. For his entire life, he had played with a chip on his shoulder, overcoming every obstacle in his path. \nAs the evening came to a close, Randle received the news that he still recites over and over again. media_camera Randle was the Pac-10 Player of the Year. \nDuring the second round, two teams had called about Randle: the Houston Rockets and the Toronto Raptors. Both teams told Randle’s representatives — ASM’s Justin Zanik and Andy Miller — that they were hoping to select the point guard with their respective second round picks. Randle’s agents decided to decline those picks. They concluded that their client was better off going undrafted and having his own say in the team he would end up with. \n“I don’t know anything about the business,” said Randle. “All I know is to play basketball.” \nUndrafted, Randle completed stints with two Summer League teams before signing his first professional contract in Turkey. Adding insult to injury, the Rockets — one of the interested teams — had just one point guard at the time, Aaron Brooks, who suffered an injury early in what would’ve been Randle’s rookie year. Those minutes, instead, went to Ishmael Smith, also a rookie, who Randle ‘dismantled, murdered’ during a pre-draft competition. \nTo this day, Randle has never played a regular season game in the NBA, and he’ll never forget that moment on draft night. It’s the one decision that almost certainly changed the course of his career, and life. \n“It’s the biggest mistake someone else has made for me,” Randle said. \n“That’s the reason I don’t allow people to make decisions for me. It’s hard for me to live with other people making decisions for me. If I make ‘em, that’s something I have to live with. \n“I don’t know if I ever got over that moment. I still have dreams about it.” \n*** \n“WHAT do you think about Australia?” \n“F*** no!” \nRandle’s professional career had taken him all across the globe — from Turkey, to China, to Belgium, to the D-League — every move taken with the NBA in mind. \nSo, when Randle’s new agent, Daniel Moldovan, approached him with the prospect of playing in Australia’s National Basketball League, the then-27-year-old was quick to shut it down. \n“It’s just a lovely place to be, but I don’t wanna go there. I’m not at the end of my career,” he said. \nBut, Randle was sick of Europe. He had to survive stretches when he wasn’t paid, struggled to overcome the language barrier, and never felt as though he was respected by the front office executives in the region. The offer from Australia was one of four that was sitting in front of Jerome and his wife, Zhordan, at that time. They looked at each other in unspoken assent. “Do we really want to deal with Europe again?” \nThey didn’t. \n“We took a chance. We took a chance and came to Australia.” \nAdelaide became Randle’s new home, and, before he could even settle into his surroundings, he immediately forged a bond with 36ers head coach, Joey Wright. The 48-year-old hails from Gary, Illinois, just 25 miles from downtown Chicago, so his relationship with his new ‘import’ was almost inevitable. They both possess a passionate, win-at-all-costs streak, and that was on show in their very first game together. Randle had joined the team a few games into the season as a replacement for the injured Kenyon McNeail, and his first performance under his new coach featured a defining moment. Wright, who’s never known for being shy, didn’t like what he was seeing from his new star, so he called him out. \n“If you don’t play your game, then you’re gonna f***in’ sit on the bench!” \nThat unexpected outburst struck a chord with Randle. ‘Damn,’ Randle remembers thinking at the time. “I’m at home now.” \nThis was more than just a coach yelling at his player, or even about accountability; it was a coach telling a player to be himself. It was a sentiment Randle hadn’t had since leaving Chicago, and it made him proud to play basketball for the first time, in a long time. \n“He’s brought the love back to the game for me. I lost that love when I was playing in Europe,” Randle said with a smile. \n“He’s telling me that he wants me to be myself. Not many coaches are gonna do that. Not many coaches are gonna give you the freedom to be you. You see a guy like Isaiah Thomas; they allow him to be Isaiah Thomas. If you take that away from him and his game, he would not be the player he is right now, today. \n“If Joey didn’t allow me to play my game and do the things that I do, we wouldn’t be in first place. If you try to take away from that, we wouldn’t be in the position we’re in right now.” \nThat position is one no-one predicted when the season began, with the 36ers sitting atop the NBL ladder, and, during a presentation on Monday night, Randle and Wright winning the MVP and Coach of the Year awards, respectively. \nIt was the first MVP of his professional career, but it wasn’t the first or only time he went on stage that evening. When Anthony Drmic won the Rookie of the Year award, Randle was up there. When Wright’s name was announced as the Coach of the Year recipient, Randle joined him on stage, too. For Nathan Sobey’s Most Improved Player award, you guessed it. media_camera Jerome Randle, the 2017 NBL MVP. \nThat’s who Randle is. Over his entire career, he’s struggled to crack the NBA, in part because of a perceived “bad attitude”, but he’s firm in shooting down that myth. Randle understands that frustration has grasped him during tough times in Europe, when he was seeking the money he rightfully earned, but things are different in Adelaide. \n“I’m happy, man. I’m happy,” Randle said. \n“Ever since I left college, I haven’t liked to play basketball. I hated it. I’ve gotten to the point, plenty of times, where I don’t even want to play anymore. Basketball wasn’t supposed to feel like that. \n“I was a grown man; I had to provide for myself, I had to provide for my family, so I felt like I had to. I needed to make money. The game started to be about money, and not about the love of the game like it used to be. But, now, I’m happy.” \n*** \nAT the beginning of the 2016-17 NBL season, Randle met with one of his long-time coaches: Donzell Starks. When Randle began playing basketball in Chicago, Starks was one of his first organised basketball coaches. “He saved my childhood,” Randle said. \nThe meeting between the two went for hours, discussing Randle’s goal to win the MVP, a championship, as well as talking about future plans. Starks planned to buy the ABA (American Basketball Association) with the hopes of making it ‘better than the D-League’. He asked Randle to be his partner in the venture. \nRandle knew Starks had cancer, but wasn’t sure how bad it was, so when his mentor passed away during the first few weeks of the NBL season, it came as a shock. Sure, Randle had dealt with the death of those close to him, but, for some reason, Starks’ passing was particularly painful. So much so, that he chose not to even attend the funeral. \n“I knew if I went back there, I probably wouldn’t have come back to Australia,” Randle said. “It was really tough for me to deal with. \n“I told him that I’m dedicating this season to him, to win a championship and an MVP.” \nThus far, Randle has fulfilled one of his promises: an MVP. The quest to conquer the other promise begins on February 16, when the 36ers enter the post-season. \nAs for what comes after this season, the NBA remains the ultimate goal, but in a different way than what Randle’s usual pursuit has been. \n“I’m not saying I’m not gonna try, because my heart is still there,” Randle said. “Spend a year in the D-League? That’s not gonna happen. I have a wife now, trying to start a family. I’ve proven myself enough to show that I should be there.” \nWinning an MVP is a step in the right direction. A championship would be another. While it had always been Randle’s dream to play in the NBA; as he’s matured, he’s come to terms with the fact that it may not happen. \nInstead, he focuses on what he does have. His family is the most important thing in his life, and he’s dominating a league he loves, on a team he adores. Randle is doing it without two of the most important people in his life, but he knows exactly what they would’ve thought about how his life turned out. \n“I know coach Starks would see my MVP and be like, ‘I knew you could do that’,” Randle said with a smile. \n“He had the type of attitude where he’ll say that he ain’t surprised. That’s the type of guy he is. ‘You’re a killer, J!’, ‘You’re a beast, J!’.” \nAnd, Chunk: “I know Chunk would be emotional,” Randle said. \n“I know my cousin, especially, would be proud. I feel like, if I had them here, I would be in the NBA right now. \n“I think Chunk would’ve been that guy, and he wouldn’t have had any motives behind trying to help me. He actually cared. He actually cared about me when I was a kid. Even though he was hard on me, and I didn’t f***king like him all the time, I knew he cared. \n“If I had someone like him around, that I actually did trust, I think my chances would’ve been a lot different.” \nLife didn’t pan out the way Jerome Randle expected it to. The dream, from day one, was to be Chicago’s next great NBA point guard, and, as it stands, that’s yet to happen. But, in a micro sense, Randle won. He ‘got out’ of Chicago — he didn’t want to become a statistic — has settled down with his wife in Adelaide — the unlikeliest of places — and is happier than he’s ever been. \n“I love bringing joy to the people I care about,” Randle said. \n“My mother and mother in-law are the two most important people in my life, next to my wife. My relationship with my mother hasn’t always been good, but that’s something we’ve been working on. \n“It’s a joy for me to see that they can come here and witness the life we have, and the love we get from this city.” \nRandle’s hope is that Chicago can transform into a city that loves him back, too. media_camera Jerome Randle with his wife, Zhordan. \nOlgun Uluc covers basketball for Fox Sports Australia.
