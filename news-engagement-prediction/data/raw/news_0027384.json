Japan still claims sovereignty over some of the islands in the chain, which it lost to Russia following World War II. Trends Kuril islands dispute \nOn Saturday, the head of the Russian government, Dmitry Medvedev, signed a decree naming five small islands of the Kuril Islands. Japan was predictably irritated by the move, as it has repeatedly protested any manifestation of Moscow’s sovereignty over what Tokyo calls it “northern territories.” \n“(The naming) goes against our country’s stance and is extremely regrettable. Japan lodged a protest Monday through a diplomatic channel,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a press conference, Kyodo reports .

Russia justifies its ownership based on the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951, which abolished Japan’s sovereignty over the 56 islands that form the Kuril chain. However, Tokyo insists that four are not part of the archipelago and should be returned to its control. \nThe issue has been high on the agenda of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Over the past few months, it has been widely reported that the government of Japan and Russia have been working on new proposals to end the decades-old spat. \nRussia has repeatedly made it clear that sovereignty of the islands is not subject to discussion, but has express willingness to conclude a peace treaty. As negotiations are already underway, Suga affirmed that bilateral territorial negotiations should proceed as planned, despite the regrettable naming incident. \n“Such a problem is the very reason why it is important to resolve the issue of the Northern Territories. Japan will move negotiations forward tenaciously,” Suga said. \nOn Saturday, Medvedev signed a decree naming two of the five islands in honor of famous Soviet generals. One was named after Lieutenant General Kuzma Derevianko, a Ukrainian-born commander who took part in the battle of Kursk and later helped liberate Hungary and Austria. He was also the Soviet Union’s representative at the signing of the armistice ending the Pacific War. ‘We do not trade territories’: Putin on Kuril Islands compromise with Japan https://t.co/NZTaipCHBt pic.twitter.com/CbQvjebhPo", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T13:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:30:27.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
