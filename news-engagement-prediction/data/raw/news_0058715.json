Each time a citizen tweets a grievance or complaint relating to the keyword, it will reflect on a central server within the home ministry. Where these grievances and complaints are found actionable, the department concerned will initiate process for their redressal and accordingly inform the complainant on Twitter. \n\nAn official said keywords will be carefully chosen and kept at a bare minimum initially to ensure that home ministry's 'Twitter Seva' is not flooded with random and irrelevant requests not related to issues directly under its domain. \n\nThe authorities concerned will be assigned to resolve problems and difficulties of people on a real-time basis, said a home ministry official. \n\nThe home ministry currently runs nearly 10 Twitter handles, including two belonging to Union home minister Rajnath Singh and one each belonging to Union ministers of state for home Kiren Rijiju and Hansraj Gangaram Ahir.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:12:26.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
