But fear not, Endeavour fans, as this doesn’t mean we are going to see the end of young Morse as a longer fifth series has already been commissioned. \nSpeaking about his new role at Casualty, Shaun enthused: ‘I’m delighted to be working on Casualty. It’s a terrific cast and crew and I’m very grateful for the opportunity.’ \nFor those not familiar with Endeavour (where have you been!?), you may recall Shaun from his role as Martha Costello’s law student Daniel Lomas in barrister drama Silk. He has also had roles in Whitechapel, Ashes To Ashes and The Scandalous Lady W.
