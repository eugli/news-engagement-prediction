The company is accused of violating federal laws when it fired Kenneth Echols after he complained about his coworkers wearing a KKK hood to torment him. #EEOC Sues Fracking Co for #RaceHarassment & #Retaliation After Black EmployeeFired for Complaining About KKK Hood https://t.co/RXK6eLJ1MP — U.S. EEOC (@EEOCNews) February 23, 2017 \nIn a press release , the EEOC claims that Echols complained to the company about his co-workers using a white hood, similar to the kind used by the Ku Klux Klan, to “ intimidate, ridicule and insult him. ” \nEchols reported the incident to a supervisor and the director of human services on April 15, according to the Houston Chronicle . After filing the complaint, Echols was then further threatened by his co-workers and reported those incidents as well.

They are asking the company to pay Echols for punitive and compensatory damages, as well as lost wages and benefits. \n\" Employers who disregard their employees' rights to be free from discrimination will be held accountable by the EEOC, \" Rudy Sustaita, regional attorney for the Houston District Office, said, according to the press release from the EEOC.
