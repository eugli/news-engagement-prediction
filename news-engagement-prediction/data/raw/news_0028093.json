A local manufacturer, Antonio D’Arliano, was the first to make a sculpture for the carnival using the method in 1925.\nThe preparations \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Preparing the float entitled The Seed of Beauty by Fabrizio Galli Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian \nThere are four categories of float that make up the parade. First class, with nine giant floats, second class with four, the group masquerades of nine floats, and the single masquerades of 15 floats. The differences are in size, complexity and the budget available. It can take over six months to build the huge floats.\nSinibaldi was given behind-the-scenes access and photographed some of the floats being constructed. There are 16 hangars where the allegorical floats are built, overlooking a large elliptical square.\n\nFabrizio Galli is working on a float that is the allegorical sequel of the one that won last year. Once again, he takes inspiration from Michelangelo, but also from the contemporary painter Karol Bak and from the philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, to say that only inner beauty, that of nature and that which can express itself in an artistic form is able to defeat the fear of what is different and alien\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Seed of Beauty by Fabrizio Galli Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Seed of Beauty by Fabrizio Galli Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian Workers create The Seed of Beauty by Fabrizio Galli\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Planet X by Franco Malfatti Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian The float Planet X by Franco Malfatti\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Planet X by Franco Malfatti Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Planet X by Franco Malfatti Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian \nThe true evil of the world is man, who through his destructive power continues to threaten the ecosystem.
