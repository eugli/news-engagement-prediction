Visitors to the Times Square restaurant can also sample milkshakes made from the pastry. \n\nThere’s not a red blooded human alive who can turn down a good frosted Poptart. I shouldn’t really have to qualify “frosted” here because obviously if you buy an unfrosted Poptart someone should repel down out of the grocery store rafters like Sting and beat your head in with a baseball bat, but I suppose there are still psychos among us, presumably gingers who fake cancer. \nBut I digress, a Poptart is one of those foods you can eat at any time, any day, and you’ll be like “shit, that was a good ass Poptart”. They are a great beach food when you wake up groggy and need to grab something fast, save that trick for later. Clearly the bread winner, the king enchilada is the frosted brown sugar cinnamon. I ate a pack on the drive to school every day of high school. The Cal Ripken of Pop Tarts if you will. The sugar rush while pretending I was being healthy AT ALL is probably the reason I struggled by the clock hit 8am, but that’s neither here nor there. \nAnd now look how far we’ve come. We have Poptart cafes opening in New York City, the City of Angels itself. Who knew that all you need to do is crumble up Poptarts, drip even more icing on them, and then you have nachos? Cut them vertically…and put more icing on them, and you have fries. And of course the burrito, where you take a Poptart, and the actual ingredients of what it’s supposed to be, wrap it in a crust, and then light it on fire \n\n\nThat’s what it’s all about, folks. Don’t let anyone tell you what you can or cannot do with a simple Poptart. America, the land of dreams indeed. \n\nPS: Vet move is to pull off the crust where they skimp on the icing and toss that trash out the window. Just get right into the meat of the ‘tart, don’t waste time or bites.
