Buzz60\nI don’t know why people are up in arms about Kellyanne Conway hawking Ivanka Trump’s clothing line live from the White House briefing room.\nI mean, it’s not as if she was telling people to go out and buy ugly clothes.\nLet’s just be honest here. You can’t Make America Great Again until America looks great again, preferably in Ivanka's Kayden4 Dress Pumps. Or in her Pleated Zipper-Trim Scuba Sheath Dress. (Now on sale for $79.99!)\nOr her Ivanka Trump Eau de Parfum Spray For Women . (America, after all, should smell as great as it looks.)\nBut alas, Ivanka’s line is in peril. It has done a disappearing act at Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus and Macy's is under pressure to dump her. What are all those Chinese seamstresses supposed to do?\nFortunately, in this, our hour of fashion emergency (and potential chill point in U.S.-Chinese relations), Kellyanne has come to the rescue. The senior presidential adviser went on Fox Thursday and exhorted viewers across the nation to “go buy Ivanka’s stuff.”\n\"It's a wonderful line,” she said. “I own some of it. I fully -- I'm going to just, I'm going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.\"\nThis, with the seal of the White House over her left shoulder.\nCue the predictable national meltdown by legislators, by lawyers, by watchdog organizations who apparently have no sense of chic and have never owned an Ivanka creation. They were aghast that a senior adviser to the president of the United States would use the nation's highest office to hawk the first daughter's merchandise.\nMe? I’m thinking at least it isn’t ugly merchandise. (Well, maybe except for the Ivanka Trump Bell Sleeve Shift Dress.)\nIn fact, I’m thinking Conway ought to expand on her genius marketing plan. She ought to invite QVC right into the Oval Office to hawk Ivanka’s wares. She could hang purses over the bust of Martin Luther King Jr., and line the Resolute desk with Ivanka’s shoes and purses.\nOur first lady, MIA since the inauguration, could model Ivanka’s spring creations.\nAnd proceeds from the sales of Ivanka’s Oval line? Well, naturally, they’d go to those brave souls who lost their lives in the Bowling Green Massacre.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2264.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-facebook@3x.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2264.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-facebook.png", "http://www1.macys.com/shop/product/ivanka-trump-pleated-zipper-trim-scuba-sheath-dress?ID=2135097&CategoryID=69934#fn=sp%3D1%26spc%3D36%26ruleId%3D65%26slotId%3D12", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2264.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-3-email@2x.png", "http://usat.ly/2k8WbH1", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2264.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-twitter@2x.png", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/2917/29906170001_5317567091001_5317560250001-th.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2264.0/images/sprites/icon_close.png", "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/2017/02/09/trump-aid-could-have-violated-ethics-laws/97708406/", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/2917/29906170001_5317567091001_5317560250001-th.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2264.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-3-email@3x.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d44bf9ac740cfa2e4c015e985cf20e4ec8d6fdc9/r=540/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/2917/29906170001_5317567578001_5317560250001-vs.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2264.0/images/social-icons/comments-copy@3x.png", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//azc.cc/2k9rFwJ&text=Roberts%3A%20Kellyanne%20Conway%2C%20making%20America%20%28look%29%20great%20again&via=azcentral", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/2917/29906170001_5317567578001_5317560250001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01IAFG07I", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/201702/2917/29906170001_5317568720001_5317560250001.mp4", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2264.0/images/social-icons/comments-copy@2x.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2264.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-twitter.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2264.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-facebook@2x.png", "http://www1.macys.com/shop/product/ivanka-trump-bell-sleeve-shift-dress?ID=4368531&CategoryID=69934#fn=sp%3D1%26spc%3D36%26ruleId%3D65%26slotId%3D34", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2264.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-twitter@3x.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2264.0/images/social-icons/oval-1-copy-3-email.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2264.0/images/social-icons/comments-copy.png", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/2917/29906170001_5317567578001_5317560250001-vs.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-10T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T21:40:16.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
