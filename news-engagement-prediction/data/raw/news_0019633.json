Picture courtesy: Instagram/sahilgsalathia \nActor Sahil Salathia has been making waves in the industry, thanks to his convincing portrayal of Yusuf, a Pakistani terrorist, in Nikkhil Advani's show P.O.W.-Bandi Yuddh Ke. \nThe talented actor recently opened up to India Today Online on the show, and why he will never do a saas-bahu daily soap. \nExcerpts from the interview: \nWhat drew you to P.O.W.? \nWell, it is a show that knows where its soul lies, and it has a tight script, which is both entertaining as well as interesting, and I knew what I was signing for when I agreed to be a part of the show. P.O.W. doesn't function like other TV shows, where you are told what you are supposed to do once you reach the sets of the show. \nHave you been approached for saas-bahu soaps? A photo posted by Sahil Salathia (@sahilgsalathia) on Feb 6, 2017 at 12:05am PST Yes, I have been approached. Many times. Ever since I first made my TV debut with Ashutosh Gowariker's Everest. That show was quite popular with the youth, so producers used to come to me (and still do) all the time with such (saas-bahu sagas) scripts, but I consciously chose to not go in that direction. I was never kicked about these stories, and I don't think it makes sense to do anything just for the heck of doing it. I do not function like that.\nAlso read: P.O.W. actor Suhaas Ahuja to get married on Valentine's Day \nWhat do you have to say about the shows that are currently being aired on TV right now? \nThere is a lot of content on TV right now, and as I said before, there are some I didn't choose to be a part of because I don't understand how you can be a bad CGI snake on national TV? I mean sure, Game of Thrones also uses a lot of CGI, but they are believable. But then there are a lot of reasons behind why a person does what he/she does. \nI mean I know a lot of people who are not at all proud of their work on television, in fact, they feel embarrassed about it. So, why would you agree to be a part of something that you are not going to be proud about in the first place? It just doesn't make any sense to me. \nTell us something about your character Yusuf on P.O.W. How did you prepare for the role? \nYusuf is a Pakistani terrorist, who is basically a lunatic, for a lack of a better word. He has these interpretations about the concept of Jihad, and he will go to any length to protect it. \nI had a super-lean physique in Everest, and in order to play Yusuf, I had to put on weight, which I did. I grew a beard, and learned a bit of Urdu. The journey from Everest to P.O.W. has been amazing. \nWhat are your plans after P.O.W. ? A video posted by Sahil Salathia (@sahilgsalathia) on Feb 7, 2017 at 8:03am PST \nTo go for a vacation, take a good break. I really can't reveal much about my next project.
