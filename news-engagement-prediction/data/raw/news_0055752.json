During the confrontation, a 13 year old male is alleged to have threatened to shoot the off-duty officer, at which time the officer attempted to detain the male until APD arrived. This led to a physical confrontation between the off-duty officer and several other juveniles. During the confrontation the officer discharged his firearm one time.‚Äù \nWhile attempting to detain 13-year-old Christian Dorscht until police arrived on the scene, the officer was assaulted by other youths, at which time he drew his firearm, appearing to fire it into the ground. No one was struck by the round. \nIn the video, the officer can be heard accusing Dorscht of threatening to ‚Äúshoot‚Äù him, while Dorscht responds that he threatened to ‚Äúsue‚Äù him, also claiming that his own father is a police officer. \nAn additional video of the episode was posted to Facebook. \nOutraged protestors targeted the officers home while others took to the streets to riot and carry out violent, malicious actions against innocent civilians and businesses in the area in scenes that have become all too familiar in U.S. cities. According to police, 24 arrests were made during the chaos. #Anaheim home of off-duty #LAPD officer was vandalized after he scuffled with teens & fired a shot @CBSLA @KNX1070 pic.twitter.com/pKQ9haGIwI \n‚Äî Jon Baird (@KNXBaird) February 23, 2017 Riot cops protecting alleged LAPD officer in #Anaheim pic.twitter.com/XRfESPuwER \n‚Äî Gabriel San Rom√°n (@gsanroman2) February 23, 2017 Cops out with rifles not sure if rubber or not #Anaheim #FTP pic.twitter.com/7hHj55oqwW \n‚Äî FW BURRITO üåØ (@FWBleu) February 23, 2017 #Anaheim : Pasa la voz.
