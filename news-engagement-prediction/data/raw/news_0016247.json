Louise and her son Joe, who made a video detailing his mum's journey (Photo: Loughborough Echo) \nLouise, who also has two other boys, Mateo, 10, and baby Jude, aged one, and is partner to Matt, 40, had surgery last week and is currently in Leicester Royal Infirmary. \nThe groundbreaking treatment they are trying to raise money for is called immunotherapy and has been described as the last resort for Louise.

Louise and her youngest son Jude, who is one (Photo: Loughborough Echo) \n“We had to talk to the three boys last week and it was heart-breaking, they have known what has been going on with their mum’s treatment, but we had to tell them that there is a possibility that she could die.\" \nThe Just Giving page currently has a goal of £50,000 but Louise’s sister Laura said that a whole course of treatment could cost £150,000. \nLouise - who also has another sister called Clare who runs Beautique, in Loughborough - has been through months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and cancer, which had spread to her neck but has now gone, is still in her cervix.
