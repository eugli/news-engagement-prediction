Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images Bruno Mars performing at the Brit Awards The ceremony took place at the O2 Arena in London on Wednesday. \nBruno Mars took the stage at the Brit Awards Wednesday evening to sing his latest hit \"That's What I Like.\" \nThe \"Uptown Funk\" singer, dressed in a vintage-inspired '90s color-block collared top with navy slacks, was backed by a band and joined by two backup singers as he effortlessly paced the stage with a choreographed routine. Toward the middle of his set, Mars positioned himself behind a mic stand and serenaded the audience. \nEarlier in the month, Mars brought his single \"That's What I Like\" to the 2017 Grammys, where he also performed a tribute to late music icon Prince alongside The Time. \nEd Sheeran, Katy Perry and Little Mix were among the other performers who took the stage at the 2017 Brit Awards, which took place at the O2 Arena in London. Mars is nominated for international male solo artist.
