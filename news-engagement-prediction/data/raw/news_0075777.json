Imbued with the hopes to reimburse G5's shaken market positions due to the lackluster G5, the G6 is a phone that drops all the controversial gimmicks in favor of all the essentialities that make a good device. It has a flashy new design with rather high screen-to-body size ratio, full metal build, and the good ol' dual setup that's already beginning to qualify as a signature feature of LG's top-end phones, the G6 seems like it's employing the winning formula. In terms of size, the G6 measures at 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9mm, which is exceptional for a device with a 5.7-inch display. To put things in perspective, we've decided to compare this one with the 5.3-inch LG G5, which stands at 149.4mm and is actually taller than the G6, the 5.7-inch LG V20 which towers the latter at 159.7mm, and a couple of other hot devices while we're at it! 5.86 x 2.83 x 0.31 inches 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm 5.75 oz (163 g) 5.88 x 2.91 x 0.29 inches 149.4 x 73.9 x 7.3 mm 5.61 oz (159 g) 5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31 inches 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9 mm 5.36 oz (152 g) 5.94 x 2.86 x 0.3 inches 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7 mm 5.54 oz (157 g) To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page. 5.86 x 2.83 x 0.31 inches 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm 5.75 oz (163 g) 6.29 x 3.07 x 0.3 inches 159.7 x 78.1 x 7.6 mm 6.14 oz (174 g) 6.23 x 3.07 x 0.29 inches 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm 6.63 oz (188 g) 5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 inches 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm 4.87 oz (138 g)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T14:18:59.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
