In this 13-part series, Logothetis lives his mission of giving back to those who gave of themselves— be prepared to be truly awed and inspired.\nWho is Leon Logothetis and why does he have a Netflix show? What is his story and why is it significant? Logothetis had it all—prestigious job, money, a home, a beautiful girlfriend and a friendly dog. But he traded it all in to live his dreams. His inner rebel, the part of him that yearns to follow his dreams, once again wanted to feel the magic of the human experience by connecting with people through the language of kindness. This is what prompted him to travel the world relying solely on the kindness and generosity of strangers. And now, he is giving back. \"I have always had a passion for interacting with people,\" says Logothetis. \"I love the camaraderie of making new friends and helping those that are deserving, and I treasure the adventure of travel.\" \nContinue Reading\nThe incredible journey of one man who sets out to circumnavigate the globe on a vintage motorbike fueled by kindness. Part adventure story, part inspirational memoir, The Kindness Diaries will introduce you to a wide world of adventure, open your eyes to the possibilities of human connection, and inspire you to accept and generate kindness in your own life. During his six-month global adventure, Leon traveled to 20 countries with no food or pre-planned accommodations. Leon discovered that people are so open to helping those in need; all one must do is open their heart. For example, in Pittsburgh , he met a homeless man named Tony who had nothing but a bag of clothes. He took Leon in, fed him, gave him a place to stay and protected him through the night. The experience will forever live in Leon's heart. If a man with nothing could give so much from his heart how could he ever repay him? You'll have to watch the show to find out!\n\"We hear about all the negative things happening out there,\" says Leon, \"but there is so much kindness out there as well that we don't ever hear about.\" The Kindness Diaries Netflix series proves that the magic of kindness is what makes the world go around and that kindness never goes out of style. It demonstrates that true wealth is in our hearts, not in our wallets. \nThe Kindness Diaries Netflix series will show you how Leon gave back to those who have little or nothing and have made sacrifices to help a neighbor, friend or the community. The Kindness Diaries not only lends support and hope to those that are deserving and in need, but it also gives them back something far more valuable—that feel-good disposition and rewarding self-esteem. The series will lift your spirits and bring you hope—maybe even inspire you to perform small acts of kindness that may literally change someone's life.  \nAbout Leon Logothetis \nLeon Logothetis is no stranger to wild journeys and outrageous globe-trotting exploits.
