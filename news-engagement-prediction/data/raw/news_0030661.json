(ABC News: Nicola Gage) 'Most of the sites undiscovered, let alone studied' \nDocumenting that value will eventually form a bid to list as World Heritage part of the Flinders Ranges. \nThe South Australian Government is leading efforts to seek the listing, and Dr Gehling has expressed confidence the remote inland region eventually will be formally recognised for its international significance. \n\"The Flinders Ranges is really quite replete with fossils — it's just that most of the sites have not been discovered, let alone studied,\" he said. \nDr Gehling has been researching the outback rocks for about half a century and says his fascination for their geological value keeps growing. \nHe said each find was like being a child opening presents at a birthday party. \n\"I'm like my six-year-old grandson, I get excited when I see something new and make a discovery,\" he said. \n\"Nilpena has the potential of hundreds of years of research work. We have literally just scratched the surface.\" Achieving world heritage status could take years \nAchieving world heritage listing is a lengthy and ambitious process, which backers believe could take up to five years. \nAnother of the researchers, Diego García-Bellido, said there could be no doubt the Ediacaran fossils of the Flinders Ranges were globally important. \n\"When I came here, it was just mind-blowing. I couldn't even believe my eyes how these things were just sitting there and you can basically touch things that were buried 550 million years ago,\" he said. \n\"I'm trying to bring into the mix the information that comes from slightly younger rocks than the Ediacaran, so the Cambrian, and putting that into context to bring out the most important values.\" \nJane and Ross Fargher run about 900 cattle on Nilpena Station, and it was Mr Fargher who discovered the ancient treasures on his property in the early 1980s and showed them to scientists. \n\"I noticed when I'd been out here mustering that there was plenty of rippled stone,\" he said. \nHe is happy to see the fossils being documented for possible World Heritage listing of the area. \n\"It needs to happen, for the protection of it and because it is known as one of the best sites in the world — we're certainly backing it all the way,\" he said. \n\"Not only would world heritage listing help better protect these ancient treasures, but it could also prove highly beneficial for tourism.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:25:56.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
