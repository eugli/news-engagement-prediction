Key points: Kevin Rudd says Labor should abandon pledge to work solely towards two-state solution Labor backbencher says recognising Palestinian state would disrupt potential for peace talks Bill Shorten expected to advocate for two-state solution in meeting with Israeli PM \nMr Rudd defended the timing of his calls to recognise a Palestinian state in an interview with AM. \n\"I am a lifelong supporter of the state of Israel,\" he said. \n\"That does not make me, however, a lifelong supporter of the policies of Benjamin Netanyahu â€” the two are quite separate.\" \nMr Rudd expressed his personal preference for recognising Palestinian statehood last week in the lead-up to the trip, and has now said the Opposition should abandon its pledge to work solely towards a two-state solution. \n\"I believe it should change at the next conference of the Labor Party,\" he said. \nMr Rudd said moves to resume Israeli settlements of disputed West Bank territories was the catalyst for a change in his views on recognising Palestinian statehood. \n\"To be fair to Labor's leadership, these have been recent and unfolding events both within Israel and the United States,\" he said, referring to recent confusion about US President Donald Trump's position on the West Bank settlements . Video: Benjamin Netanyahu arrives in Australia for historic visit (7.30) \nA change to immediate recognition for a Palestinian state could be problematic for Mr Shorten, whose faction numbers several staunchly pro-Israel identities. \nOne is backbencher Michael Danby, who told PM yesterday the views of Mr Rudd and former prime minister Bob Hawke, who has also recently called for the recognition of a Palestinian state, were misguided. \n\"I think Kevin's just wrong,\" he said. \nMr Danby said recognition of a Palestinian state would disrupt the potential for peace talks, but Mr Rudd dismissed his concerns. \n\"Mr Danby is one voice within the nearly 100 members of the federal parliamentary party,\" Mr Rudd said. \n\"But I am also a member of the Labor Party and I also have a right to articulate my own view.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:31:08.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
