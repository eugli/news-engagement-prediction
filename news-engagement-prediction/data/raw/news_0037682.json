I don't know if it will be the end of the season or next season. \n\"Now we send all our support to him and his family and we are waiting until he is back.\" \nBrazil international Jesus made a bright start to his City career since joining from Palmeiras, scoring three goals and keeping the more established Sergio Aguero out of the side. \nHis injury means Argentina international Aguero will return to spearhead City's attack after being dropped to the bench for their past few games. \n\"It's not easy for the players who do not play,\" Guardiola said. \"Their behaviour has been more than professional, it was perfect, and Sergio too. \n\"He showed in the last minutes against Swansea, for example, or in the last game at Bournemouth after the injury from Gabriel where he came in and played good and scored a goal. \n\"I don't have doubts about the quality because it was always there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:37:11.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
