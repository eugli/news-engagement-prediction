Key points: Lieutenant General Angus Campbell was in Jakarta on Wednesday to discuss the rift One of the offensive documents reportedly mocked Indonesia's 'Pancasila' principle of unity Indonesia's Justice Minister praises the mending of ties between the two countries But military cooperation will not resume until President Widodo has been consulted \nIn a statement released by the Indonesian military overnight, General Gatot Nurmantyo says Army Chief Angus Campbell promised that the careers of those responsible would be affected. \nThe statement said: \"General Gatot has accepted the apology, and realised that in the era of global competition right now, unity and friendship are needed for neighbouring countries, without putting aside their differences.\" \nOne of the documents that caused offence was a poster that mocked the Indonesian principles of unity, known as Pancasila. \n\"Pancasila is the ideology of Indonesia, and its citizens,\" General Gatot said. \n\"Indonesians are willing to die to defend its ideology, especially for the military, this is a very sensitive matter and hurtful.\" \nLieutenant General Angus Campbell was in Jakarta on Wednesday to meet General Gatot over the rift that led to Indonesia suspending military cooperation with Australia last month. \nThe Indonesian military initially announced that it had suspended all military cooperation with Australia, before the Indonesian Government intervened two days later and said the suspension would only affect a language training course \nGeneral Gatot said Lieutenant General Campbell apologised and expressed deep regret over the incident. \nGeneral Gatot said that Angus Campbell promised the ADF would impose \"firm sanctions\" on all personnel responsible for the incident.

(Reuters: Beawiharta Beawiharta, file) \nGeneral Gatot added that he accepted the Australian apology, but military cooperation with Australia would not resume until he had consulted Indonesia's president Joko Widodo. \nThe statement said that during the meeting, General Gatot expressed his thanks for the \"firm and fast\" response from the chief of Defence Force and the Chief of the Australian Army. \nEarlier on Wednesday, Indonesia's Security and Justice Minister Wiranto said that the relationship between Indonesia and Australia was solid. \n\"The relationship is well maintained. And about the little incidents that may occur, they're just individual statements, really,\" General Wiranto, who is a former commander of the Indonesian military, said. \n\"We can't let it destabilise the strong relationship between the two countries.\" \n\"I think there are people in both Australia and Indonesia who aren't happy with the good relationship. Or those who share different views from the government. And that's a very very normal thing to happen in a relationship. And it shouldn't be the main reason to break a relationship. \n\"So I really appreciate the intention of the two chiefs to resolve the issue together like a family.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:04:54.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
