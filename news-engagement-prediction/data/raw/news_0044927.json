Sale star Denny Solomona has been an instant hit since switching codes to rugby union (Photo: Nathan Stirk) Share Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDenny Solomona has let it be known to friends that he DOES want to play rugby union for England. \nAnd former Red Rose star Austin Healey believes he is good enough to go straight from club rookie to Warren Gatland’s Lions squad. \nSolomona, 23, stunned Premiership leaders Wasps with a first-half hat-trick for Sale on Sunday. \nThat took his try-tally to eight in five league games since his contentious switch from rugby league side Castleford in December. \nNew Zealand-born, he represented Samoa at rugby league and said as recently as September that “my heart's not here, it's not for England”. \nBut that was in his league days. After an explosive start to his union career which has put him third in the try charts in just five Premiership outings, he is said to have had a rethink. \nHealey last night hailed Solomona - who broke the Super League try record in 2016 with 42 - as the \"best finisher in the league\". \nThe ex-England wing added: “He’s very physical and positionally sound and he scores tries in confined spaces that other wingers wouldn’t finish. \n“People will say ‘give him time to find his feet in union’ but why? I already think he’s good enough make the Lions squad. \n“Who better is there to match against New Zealand wing Julian Savea? I accept he’s an outside bet in terms of experience but Jason Robinson had hardly any in 2001 and that didn't go too badly. \n\"Personally Solomona and Wasps’ hooker Tommy Taylor would be my two Lions bolters.” \nFirst things first, Solomona has to qualify on the three-year residency rule - soon to be changed to five. \nSale believe March 8 marks his third anniversary, though they have yet to register him as an England Qualified Player. \nEngland boss Eddie Jones does not miss a trick so it is inconceivable he has not circled the date in his diary. \nSteve Diamond, who faces a disciplinary panel tomorrow to answer a charge of verbally abusing match officials in a match at Harlequins on Feb 3, is in no doubt of Solomona’s potential. \n\"Denny makes his opportunities and takes his opportunities,” said Sale’s director of rugby. “That's what we knew he would bring to the party and if he keeps doing that, he will go a long way.” \nAustin Healey is a proud ambassador of Jeep Grand Cherokee www.jeep.co.uk Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:01:58.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
