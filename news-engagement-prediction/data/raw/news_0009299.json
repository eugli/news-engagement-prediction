Security at Trump Tower has been beefed up since the election. \nThe disruption at the Fifth Avenue location is a problem for Tiffany, since the flagship store accounts for about 10% of its overall sales. \nIn the holiday period, the company's overall sales were up only slightly from 2015. Strong demand from Japan and China wasn't enough to offset the weakness in the U.S. and sluggish sales in Europe. \nCumenal also said last month that he did not expect \"any significant improvement in 2017,\" due to broader economic challenges facing the company. \nTiffany says it expects to report its full 2016 fiscal year results on March 17. \n--CNNMoney's Paul R.
