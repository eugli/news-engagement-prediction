It got rubbed off during a mass “scratchathon”, a phenomenon that sees dozens of animals periodically gather, apparently to socialise and groom each other by rubbing their massive bodies together. \n“This is a large piece of skin that came off an adult female sperm whale, part of a family group of nine individuals,” says Tony Wu, who captured this image in the Indian Ocean.

Tony Wu/naturepl.com \n“The shedding of skin is part of a natural antifouling mechanism to stop them being encrusted with other marine animals and parasites,” says Luke Rendell, a marine biologist at the University of St Andrews, UK. \nRendell says sperm whales typically live in groups with no more than six to 12 members. But on occasions like these photographed by Wu, as many as 70 animals come together for hours or days. “They love touching against each other and one of the rewards may be exfoliation,” says Rendell. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline “Skinny stripping” \nMore on these topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:18:00.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
