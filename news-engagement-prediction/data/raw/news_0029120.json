I don’t think their quality has dropped drastically just because they don’t have a head coach,” said Azamuddin. \n“They have retained most of the players from last season’s squad like Shukor (Adan), Norshahrul (Idlan Talaha) and Hadin (Azman). They are top players. I’m sure they will be looking to bounce back against us. \n“We can’t be going into the match expecting our rivals to be distracted. \n“We need to get the job done and it’s our target to retain the FA Cup this season.” \nThe Southern Tigers, under new coach Benjamin Mora of Mexico, have yet to get into stride so far in their Super League title defence. They are seventh with five points from a win and two draws. \n“There’s a change in our playing style, but we’ve improved with each game. I’m sure we will get the results soon,” said Azamuddin. \n“Tomorrow is a must-win game for us. And I’m confident of getting the result if we stick to our game plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:52:25.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
