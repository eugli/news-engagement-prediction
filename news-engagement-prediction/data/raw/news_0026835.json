(Evan Vucci/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  26 PM \nSenior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway showed some love to a Twitter user who appears to identify as a white nationalist. \nConway appeared on NBC’s “Today” show Tuesday morning dodging questions about the resignation of embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn . \nHe stepped down Monday night after admitting he misled Vice President Pence and other senior officials about communicating with a Russian diplomat over sanctions. \n“Today” host Matt Lauer said to Conway her responses made “no sense,” prompting her to tweet in defense that she serves “at the pleasure of the @POTUS.” Conway replied to a tweet after her \"Today\" show appearance Monday. (@KellyannePolls via Twitter) \nTwitter user Lib Hypocrisy praised Conway’s “strength,” “resiliency” and considered her as inspiration. The counselor to the President then retweeted the post and said “Love you back” while also wishing a happy Valentine’s day to her “Hapless Haters.” \nLib Hypocrisy’s Twitter description features the hashtags #WhiteIdentity, #Nationalist and her declaration of love for Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon and Geert Wilders, an anti-Muslim Dutch politician who was found guilty of discrimination in December. \nThe profile also includes the icon of Pepe the Frog — a green cartoon associated with the alt-right movement. Conway has since deleted the tweet. (@KellyannePolls via Twitter) \nConway has since deleted the tweet and told BuzzFeed News she had no clue who may have retweeted from her account. \n“I denounce whoever it is,” she said, adding that “everybody makes mistakes.” \nIn recent weeks, Conway has been criticized for offering “ alternative facts ” — a term she first used on NBC’s Meet the Press to defend the false assertions of the crowd size at Trump's inauguration. \nConway also cited the “ Bowling Green massacre ” — a terror attack that never happened — to back up the President’s executive order barring travelers from seven predominately-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:58:50.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
