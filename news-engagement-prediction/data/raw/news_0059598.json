The tower will be located on the north side of West Gray at Driscoll Street, at the current site of Local Pour, Café Ginger and adjacent parking. It will include 300 luxury units and about 10,000 square feet of ground-floor retail. The project is tentatively expected to break ground in 2018 and be complete in 2021.

John Anderson , Weingarten’s regional development director, will oversee the development. “The integration of a luxury residential tower is transformative for River Oaks Shopping Center and will further solidify it as a premier mixed-use project in Houston,” Gerald Crump , senior vice president for Weingarten, said in a press release. “Plans also include special attention to design, walkability, placemaking and additional retail parking to ensure the long-term success of our retailers and enjoyment of our future residents.” Weingarten has been considering adding mixed-use components — including residential — to the River Oaks Shopping Center for a little over a year now . The 320,000-square-foot shopping center runs along West Gray Street for multiple blocks beginning at South Shepherd Drive and includes more than 75 stores and restaurants, as well as the historic River Oaks Theatre. Weingarten also has said it’s considering additional retail and structured parking, as well as improved pedestrian walkability and enhanced public spaces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:56:00.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
