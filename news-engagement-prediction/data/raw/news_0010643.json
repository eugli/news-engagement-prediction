When we visited the Girls creator and star at her bright and airy home in Los Angeles for a rapid-fire round of 73 Questions, absolutely nothing was off-limits, from what she’s reading right now to who we should be following on Instagram and just what she’d say to her Internet trolls—and President Donald J. Trump. Dunham, no stranger to self-exposure, revealed all, including her deepest fears, which Girls actresses were the most and least comfortable when filming sex scenes (the answer may surprise you), when she feels the most beautiful, and what a Girls 10 years in the future might look like. Then again, it may also be news to know that Dunham is a fan of another beloved television series: Friends . While Dunham couldn’t name Chandler Bing’s job, her quirky-cool décor style was right in line with that of Monica Geller, and she had Paul Monroe, the man who did the interior design, on hand to show for it. And about that design: “We’re a pretty poodle-y household,” Dunham says of the dog figurines that populate her house, and soon Monroe gifts her with a live version, straight from the bedroom closet that she’s turned into an office. But it’s not all surface: Social issues are never far from her mind throughout the tour. One room in the unapologetically quirky abode is themed “queer and feminist resistance and our important foremothers and forefathers,” and features sparkling animal masks and a display of iconic coffee-table books; the living room has a diorama of Stuyvesant Square park, the pool, a sunflower-shaped float. The guesthouse has an open-floor plan and cartoon-style dolls of Dunham and her boyfriend, Jack Antonoff, and would also, Dunham suggests, prove an ideal place for a sleepover with, in ideal circumstances, Ariana Grande and Dorothy Parker “together—they’d have to share a bed.” Neil Patrick Harris puts in an appearance via Skype to bust out some dance moves, and Dunham collaborator Judd Apatow (whose name she has lovingly combined with his wife, Leslie Mann’s to “Judd-lie”) even plays a part. To top it all off, Dunham demonstrates two hidden secret talents and offers a brief oral history behind all nine of her tattoos, plus lets us in on her plans for her next ink, and which famous friend will be wielding the tattoo gun. To get the full story, watch Dunham answer 73 of our most pressing questions all in fewer than 10 minutes flat, as seen in Vogue.com’s exclusive video above.
