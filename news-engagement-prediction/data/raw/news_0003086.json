He said: 'When the wall arrives at the southern border, we shut the lights; we pretend we’re not home. It’s C.O.D.; Mexico has to sign for it.' The next executive order was to give America the official language of 'bulls***' not English. Stewart joked: 'I, Donald J. Lincoln Kennedy Trump III do pronounce America now finally has an official language.' 'America now finally has an official language. The new official language of the United States is bulls***.' The final executive order wasn't as much of an order as it was a declaration. Stewart said Trump musty be very tired from signing so many actions. Stewart read out executive orders which included having China send America its wall On a darker note, Stewart delved into the order reciting: 'I, Donald J. Trump, am exhausting. It has been 11 days, Stephen. 11 f days. Eleven. The presidency is supposed to age the president, not the public.' The reason that I, Donald J. Trump, am exhausting is that every instinct and fiber of my pathological self-regard calls me to abusive power. I want — no, deserve — not just your respect but your adoration. Parades with the tanks and the synchronized dancing, and why can’t they train 10,000 doves to spell out “Trump” in the clouds? How hard can it be? They’re already flying. I, Donald J. Trump, am exhausting because it is going to take relentless stamina, vigilance and every institutional check and balance this great country can muster to keep me, Donald J. Trump, from going full Palpatine, with the lightning coming out of the fingertips and “fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate.” Stewart compared Donald Trump to the evil Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars (left) We have never faced this before. Purposeful, vindictive chaos. But perhaps therein lies the saving grace of my, Donald J. Trump’s, presidency. No one action will be adequate. All actions will be necessary. And if we do not allow Donald Trump to exhaust our fight and somehow come through this presidency calamity-less and constitutionally partially intact, then I, Donald J. Trump, will have demonstrated the greatness of America. Just not the way I thought I was gonna. Stewart and Trump have a history of arguing - they famously clashed on Twitter in 2013 after Trump appeared to have a dig about Stewart not using his birth name, tweeting: 'I promise you that I'm much smarter than Jonathan Leibowitz - I mean Jon Stewart. Who, by the way, is totally overrated.' Stewart responded by tweeting: 'Many people don’t know this, but Donald Trump’s real name is ‘F***face Von Clownstick.' Days later Trump wrote in a 1.30am tweet: 'Little Jon Stewart(?) Is a p****, he would be hopeless in a debate with me!'
