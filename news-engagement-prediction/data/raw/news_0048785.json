CSX Corp. (NASDAQ: CSX) announced Tuesday that Chairman and CEO Michael Ward and President Clarence Gooden are retiring from the company effective May 31. Fredrik Eliasson , the company’s current chief sales and marketing officer, has been appointed as president of CSX, effective Feb. 15. Enlarge Michael Ward announced his retirement as the CEO of CSX Corp. Gooden will assume the role of vice chairman until his retirement. Meanwhile, Eliasson will maintain his current responsibilities in his new position, according to a statement from the company. The news of Ward's and Gooden's retirements come amidst plans for Hunter Harrison , the former CEO of Canadian Pacific, and Mantle Ridge to take over CSX. However, the Jacksonville-based railroad says Eliasson’s appointment is not intended to preempt or affect CSX’s discussions with Harrison and Mantle Ridge regarding Harrison becoming CEO of CSX. “Fredrik has played a vital role in CSX’s progress in recent years and in the development of the next phase of its strategic plan, and he was a natural choice to help the Company continue to advance its CSX of Tomorrow strategy,” Ward said in a statement. “He has the vision, leadership abilities and deep understanding of our business to help CSX’s future leadership achieve its long-term strategic goals.” Eliasson, a 22-year-old veteran of the CSX, was a favorite to take the role of CEO following Ward’s planned retirement in 2019. Prior to being chief sales and marketing officer, he served as chief financial officer. Eliasson was promoted following the departure of Oscar Munoz — long thought the heir apparent to Ward — from the company in 2015. “This is a dynamic and important time at CSX,” Eliasson said in a statement, “and I look forward to continuing to work with the management team to implement the best ideas to drive growth across the organization and deliver a compelling future for our Company and our shareholders.” Jensen covers technology, retail and entrepreneurship.
