But the work was in his blood — as a paramedic, Couch had assisted with one of the state’s first out-of-hospital resuscitations — and his timing was good. The University of Louisville School of Medicine had just established the nation’s second-ever academic emergency medical department, and Couch found Louisville more than Southern enough for comfort. Then, on “match day” — when fourth-year med students get their residency assignments — the stars aligned. U of L it was. In business Couch eventually became chief emergency medicine resident at Sts. Mary and Elizabeth Hospital, which was then owned by the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth. Hoping to upgrade the hospital, they asked U of L to run the emergency department. The university declined, Couch recalled, so the sisters asked the residents to take over. Thus was born Southern Emergency Medical Specialists, which Couch founded with colleagues Don Belknap and Ted Forrest. Today, the group employs more than 50 people and is one of the few independent emergency medicine practices left standing. About five years ago, Norton Healthcare contracted with SEMS to staff the ER at Audubon Hospital, where Couch also serves as medical director of the emergency department. The practice now provides the same services at Norton’s flagship hospital downtown and at Norton Brownboro. E xpecting the unexpected One thing that sets emergency medicine apart from other specialities is immediacy. Circumstances change quickly. “You can be sitting there doing nothing,” Couch said, “and five seconds later, a mother may run in with a child who’s not breathing. You have to be able to handle just about anything at a moment’s notice.” Most emergency medicine workers are type A personalities who “like to get things done,” Couch added. “We’re not as cerebral as the internist, for example. We have to make decisions with little information.” Couch is widely engaged in the profession beyond his ER work. He’s a former president and current board chair of the Greater Louisville Medical Society, and he belongs to the American College of Emergency Physicians, twice serving as Kentucky chapter president. He is the chair of Kentucky Physicians PAC, which is focused on reining in medical malpractice costs that Couch believes discourage doctors from continuing to practice in the state. He’s on the board of The Healing Place, which provides free drug-and-alcohol treatment, and of Teach to Transform, a faith-based nonprofit that teaches basic medical, farming and mechanical skills to pastors and organizations in underserved nations. While Couch’s work in those roles may be known mainly within small circles, he became prominent over the summer when he stepped into the middle of a public health emergency. A scary situation ER docs have a particular window into societal ills, and Couch has long realized a certain percentage of people will use illegal drugs despite potentially life-threatening consequences. But he wasn’t ready for what he encountered during a regular shift at Norton downtown. “My first patient was a heroin overdose, and so were my second, third and fourth,” he recalled. “I knew something different was going on. I’ve never seen that in 30 years.” The culprit was fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that had been added to the heroin in such large amounts that it became toxic. Couch learned that ERs at Jewish and University hospitals were seeing far more overdoses, and he suggested Norton’s public relations department sound the alarm. Within an hour, local TV news descended on Norton. Couch, still on duty, held a press conference. He was widely praised for speaking out. A family man Couch and his wife Wilma met when both worked at U of L Hospital. She was his practice’s first office manager, then turned her focus to raising their two daughters, now grown and pursuing careers. He’s still in love with science -— he likes gadgets such as fountain pens and mechanical watches, and he’s currently enamored with his new Tesla Model S 90D. He hoped to fly in the military but “didn’t have the eyes for it.” Today he enjoys piloting his own hot air balloon. And growing up near Muscle Shoals, Ala., home of the renowned FAME Studios, he is a huge music fan. In that regard, he was likely influenced by brother Tommy, 14 years his senior, who earned a pharmacy degree but instead became a noted music producer and record company executive. Tommy was recently inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. The right call If a Southern university had been able to provide the medical training that Robert Couch sought, chances are he never would’ve made it to Louisville. But he loves it here and he finds it quite Southern, particularly in how people interact and stay connected. He said it’s a lot like Birmingham, Ala., where he attended medical school. Though he admits it’s nice when someone thanks him for saving the life of a loved one, he tends to deflect credit. But he’s thrilled to be honored by Business First with its Lifetime Hero award. “It was totally unexpected,” he said, “and I’m floored. I’m successful because I’ve been associated with so many great people — it’s standing on the shoulders of others who’ve done so much collectively.” Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:27:38.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
