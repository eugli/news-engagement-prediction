I mean after living all these years in this little town and we come through here pretty much every day. I was really sick of it. I’m still sick of it.”\nVICE News correspondent David Noriega visited the 100 mile zone where many fear the Trump administration’s proposal to add 5,000 agents will only make matters worse.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Farizona-residents-in-this-small-town-are-keeping-an-eye-on-border-patrol-agents", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Arizona"], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:25:23.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
