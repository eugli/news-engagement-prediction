Buffalo led 13-6 at the half but was outscored 24-0 in the second half. Troy Aikman played one week after suffering a severe concussion against the 49ers. Emmitt Smith had his back with 132 yards rushing and two touchdowns. 40. Super Bowl XXVI \nWashington 37, Bills 24; Jan. 26, 1992 — Minneapolis \nJoe Gibbs won his third Super Bowl with three different quarterbacks: Joe Theismann, Doug Williams and this time Mark Rypien, who was the MVP after throwing for 292 yards and two TDs. Washington had a 27-point lead in the fourth quarter before Buffalo showed some pride by scoring two touchdowns in the final six minutes. The game had early intrigue with Thurman Thomas on the bench for the first two plays after misplacing his helmet. It was the second straight Super Bowl loss for the Bills, who would then lose to the Cowboys the next two years. 41. Super Bowl XII \nCowboys 27, Broncos 10; Jan. 15, 1978 — New Orleans \nTom Landry couldn’t decide who to start in a 1971 game at Chicago: Roger Staubach or Craig Morton? So, he had them alternate by play. Dallas lost, Landry settled on Staubach and the Cowboys went on to win the Super Bowl the next year. Morton was later traded to the Giants — the Cowboys used Big Blue’s first-round pick to take Randy White — and he eventually wound up in Denver facing Staubach in the Super Bowl. If Morton was trying to prove to Landry he made the wrong choice, he was not convincing: He was benched afer completing 4 of 15 passes for 39 yards with four INTs. Staubach’s 45-yard TD to Butch Johnson in the third quarter put the game away. 42. Super Bowl XXXV \nRavens 34, Giants 7; Jan. 28, 2001 — Tampa \nThe Giants were not competitive against one of the great defenses of all time. Kerry Collins was intercepted four times and the Ravens held the Giants to 152 yards of offense. The Giants’ only score came on Ron Dixon’s 97-yard kickoff return to bring them within 17-7 in the third quarter. But Jermaine Lewis immediately answered with an 84-yard kickoff return for a TD to put the game out of reach. The Super Bowl week was all about Ray Lewis, who one year earlier was charged with double murder in Atlanta in the hours after the Rams-Titans Super Bowl. He spent 15 days in jail but the charges were later dropped after he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of obstruction of justice. Lewis was named Super Bowl MVP, but breaking from tradition the NFL did not put him on the cover of the following season’s Record and Fact book, a place usually reserved for Super Bowl MVPs. 43. Super Bowl XXXIII \nBroncos 34, Falcons 19; Jan. 31, 1999 — Miami \nJohn Elway and Mike Shanahan vs. Dan Reeves was a mismatch as Elway finished up his career with back-to-back championships. But the story of the game was Falcons safety Eugene Robinson. On the morning of the day before the game, he received the Bart Starr award for high moral character. That night, with his family in town, he left the hotel and was arrested for solicitation of an undercover police officer posing as a prostitute. Robinson was offering $40. He was beat by Rod Smith for a TD in the second quarter on an 80-yard pass from Elway. Clearly, he had other things on his mind. 44. Super Bowl XXIX \n49ers 49, Chargers 26; Jan. 29, 1995 — Miami \nSteve Young was on the sideline in the final minutes asking teammates to take the monkey off his back. Why? He had finally emerged from the shadow of Joe Montana by throwing for 325 yards and a Super Bowl record six TDs. Jerry Rice caught 10 passes for 149 yards and three touchdowns. It was the 49ers’ fifth Super Bowl title, but they have been back just once since and lost. The Chargers have not been asked to return. 45. Super Bowl XXVII \nCowboys 52, Bills 17; Jan. 31, 1993 — Pasadena \nHow ’bout them Cowboys? It took 16 years for the Cowboys to get back to the Super Bowl, but they made up for lost time. Troy Aikman threw four TDs, Emmitt Smith ran for 108 yards and the Bills turned it over nine times. But the most memorable play came when Leon Lett was showboating on his way toward the end zone with a fumble recovery. Don Beebe chased him down and knocked the ball out of his hands after Lett had run 64 yards. 46. Super Bowl XXII \nWashington 42, Broncos 10; Jan. 31, 1988 — San Diego \nDoug Williams became the first African-American quarterback to start the Super Bowl. It came following a week in which he was asked at a media session, “How long have you been a black quarterback?” The night before the game, Williams required emergency dental work, but it clearly didn’t impact him in the game. After trailing 10-0, Washington exploded in the second quarter, scoring five TDs on 18 plays in just 5:47. Williams finished with 340 yards passing and four TDs. But the Super Bowl MVP was running back Timmy Smith, who had 204 yards rushing, still a Super Bowl record, with two TDs, including a 58-yard score. 47. Super Bowl XVIII \nRaiders 38, Washington 9; Jan. 22, 1984 — Tampa \nThis game produced the play that was the most glaring error of Joe Gibbs’ coaching career. Washington trailed 14-3 in the final seconds of the first half. Instead of having Joe Theismann take a knee deep in his own end of the field and head into the locker room still in the game, Theismann made Jack Squirek a Super Bowl hero. He lofted a pass in the flat that Squirek picked off and returned five yards for a touchdown. Marcus Allen, who ran for 191 yards, had TD runs of five and 74 yards in the second half and was named Super Bowl MVP. The Raiders have been holding steady at three Super Bowl victories for the last 32 years. 48. Super Bowl XX \nBears 46, Patriots 10; Jan. 26, 1986 — New Orleans \nThe Bears were a wild team and spent more time on Bourbon Street than the practice field. Even before they won the game, they taped the “Super Bowl Shuffle,” which became a hit video. Jim McMahon mooned a local TV news crew to show them where he had acupuncture, the Bears defense overwhelmed the Patriots and Mike Ditka angered Walter Payton by giving the ball to Refrigerator Perry to score at the goal line instead of him. 49. Super Bowl XLVIII \nSeahawks 43, Broncos 8; Feb. 2, 2014 — East Rutherford, N.J. \nThe fear was this was going to be a terrible game if snow and cold weather showed up. The weather was almost spring-like. The problem was the Broncos didn’t show up. The game was over as soon as the first snap of the game sailed over Peyton Manning’s right shoulder and was recovered in the end zone by the Broncos for a safety. The Seahawks led 22-0 at the half and any thoughts of a Broncos comeback ended when Percy Harvin returned the second-half kickoff 87 yards for a touchdown. 50. Super Bowl XXIV \n49ers 55, Broncos 10; Jan. 28, 1990 — New Orleans \nIn a four-year period, the Broncos were outscored by 96 points in three Super Bowls. Joe Montana threw for 297 yards and five TDs, bringing his four-game Super Bowl total to 11 TDs and 0 INTs and three MVPs.
