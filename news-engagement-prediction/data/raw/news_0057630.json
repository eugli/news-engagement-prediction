Peter Gianopoulos, the owner and chef behind Nob Hill's Matanza and Downtown's Q Burger,… more courtesy with Coe & Peterson A well-known chef is cooking up something on the Westside. Peter Gianopoulos , the owner and chef behind Nob Hill's Matanza and Downtown's Q Burger, is set to open a sister concept in the former Stumbling Steer location in the Cottonwood shopping area. Peter Gianopoulos, the owner and chef behind Nob Hill's Matanza and Downtown's Q Burger,… more courtesy with Coe & Peterson Gianopoulos' new Matanza concept location will feature a full liquor offering and offer a spin on craft food, including barbecue. The restaurant is taking up 8,000 square feet in the 25,000-square-foot building, said Teneé Swingle , broker with Coe & Peterson. \"Peter has been a smash hit in Nob Hill,\" said Swingle. \"He will bring an innovative perspective on food to the Cottonwood corridor.\" Joining Matanza will be a taproom from Desert Valley Brewing, which will occupy 3,800 square feet. The space will include a large patio. Swingle said Coe & Peterson is trying to recreate a premier district for dining, entertainment and walkability, similar to Nob Hill, on Albuquerque's Westside. Coe & Peterson purchased the five-acre property off Ellison and Alameda, now dubbed The Ellison Project, for $3.8 million. With Matanza and the taproom, along with WisePies occupying 2,132 square feet, there's about 10,000 square feet of commercial space left. Swingle said the restaurant and brewery should open sometime this summer. Thomas Kight of Realty One of New Mexico was the broker for Gianopoulos. Stumbling Steer closed in April 2015, a year after a high-profile opening and a $2 million remodel of the former Quarters restaurant and liquor store. Mike Baird bought the property for $4.8 million and opened Vernon’s Open Door. That restaurant closed after about a year. Coe & Peterson have earmarked over $1 million for tenant improvement money . 505.348.8323 | cortiz@bizjournals.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:15:07.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
