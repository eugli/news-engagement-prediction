Starting next week, users who will be affected by the change will start seeing a banner at the top of Gmail telling them to upgrade to an up-to-date version of Googleâ€™s browser.\nThe affected browser versions include Chrome v49, the last version of the software that supports XP and Vista. While Microsoft officially ended support for XP more than two and a half years ago , Gmail has continued to work with it. Vista Service Pack 2 will reach the end of its extended support period on April 11.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:46:57.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
