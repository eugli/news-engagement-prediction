Guardiola claims treatment of managers is unacceptable \n“What I’ve heard in the last 10 days about what the people - former players and journalists - (how they) treated for example Arsene Wenger is unacceptable,” he said. \n“For me, (in) our job at the moment we don’t have any respect for any position. \n“What happened was unacceptable. \n“We take decisions and you can say whatever you want.” \nGuardiola clearly wanted to make a statement, with his defence of Wenger unprompted. \nRather, he was asked about his own decision to name a weakened team against Championship promotion-chasing Huddersfield that now means City will have to squeeze a replay into an increasingly congested calendar. \nPep Guardiola's biggest Man City error confirmed by one name in his Huddersfield line up \n“I take my decisions and you analyse them after,” he said. “I have to take the decision before. \n“The best solution was what I’d done. After if you don’t agree then you can write.” \nGuardiola rested key players Kevin de Bruyne, Leroy Sane, Raheem Sterling, David Silva and Yaya Toure for the trip to the John Smith’s Stadium. \nAll are expected to be recalled for Tuesday’s Champions League tie with Monaco before City head to Abu Dhabi for warm weather training. \nShould City progress in Europe they face a potential fixture pile-up, with the derby with Manchester United already postponed due to Jose Mourinho’s side’s involvement in the Capital One Cup on Sunday. \nThe replay with Huddersfield will take place Tuesday February 28.
