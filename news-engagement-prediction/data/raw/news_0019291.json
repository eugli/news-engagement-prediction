Really, do those ever end? \nThe University of Tennessee, as did so many other big-time college football programs, made official what it needed to last Wednesday on National Signing Day for its 2017 class while it already had turned the page toward 2018, ‘19 and beyond. \n“We made close to a hundred calls over the course of the day and probably triple that in texts,” the Vols’ personnel guru and program glue-man Bob Welton told 247Sports in an exclusive interview. “Eric Josephs had those guys lined up. I was teasing him two hours into the show, ‘Have you looked up yet, do you even know where you’re at or are you aware of your surroundings?’” \n(What's next for the Vols? Make sure you're in the loop — take five seconds to sign up for our FREE Vols newsletter now!) Because of improving but not yet fully roster-stocking talent in the Volunteer State, Tennessee is again on the forefront of establishing a foundation in future classes. The Vols already own commitments from 247Sports five-star and No. 1 in-state player Cade Mays in their ‘18 class, as well as four-star Alontae Taylor --- No. 9 in the state’s early top-10 list. \nThe key? Communication, a point of emphasis for the Vols and Welton since Welton’s arrival four years ago from the NFL’s Cleveland Browns. \n“From a communications standpoint, I think we’re further along than ever before,” Welton explained to 247Sports. “And I think we’ve done a good job of identifying the ‘19s, especially in-state and working them hard. Now with the texting rule and the change, probably everybody is further along because of the communication is easier. \n“But I know I feel really good about the ‘18s and what we’ve done up to this point. We’ve just got to keep grinding on them, but it’s further along than it’s ever been.” \nSo, too, are the Vols from an offers executed standpoint --- be it scholarship or camp invitations. \n“I think it’s 215,” Welton continued. “A lot of those are camp offers, and the kids know that when you get them. That’s usually what we do. \n“I would say we’re further along because of guys like Matt Wilson, it’s Eric Josephs obviously, but Matt’s great and Merci (Falaise) is awesome and Ab (Patrick Abernathy), because they’re kind of the communication people. Whether it’s high school coaches or this guy’s dad I have a connection with, all those guys are really good and always have been. And then each kid, we assign a student-worker to each coach and they do a good job of posting something out there. Or saying, ‘Hey, Coach, we got these 10 kids today.’ So I think they do a good job of staying on that and that’s obviously organized by Matt. As a department, it’s just been great.” \nThe final piece to the Vols’ communications and recruiting puzzle, one in which the staff is confident of assembling an ‘18 class that further spurs championship aspirations, is Makenzie Franklin, now finishing up nearly her first year since taking over for the incredibly well-respected Dana Morrison-Hibbs. \n“Makenzie, it’s been great and I always say all the great quotes we get about our visits, it’s really Makenzie Franklin,” Welton said. “And she learned from the best in Dana and it’s really been a seamless transition because Makenzie worked for her so close and so at times it was just like having Dana.
