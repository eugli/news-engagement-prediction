Consider the latest cold-comfort moisturizers that tap into advanced, smart technology to heal and shield your face from the harshest of elements. And the radiant, dewy-but-not-greasy glow they deliver—in the short and long term—is reason enough to stock up now. In its Paris laboratory, Clarins studied the effects of “thermic” shocks—i.e., sudden changes in temperature and humidity—that can leave your skin parched and flaky. Its new rich cream is infused with kalanchoe pinnata, a hardy succulent that’s known as the “leaf of life” for its ability to stimulate natural production of quenching hyaluronic acid so your body can bounce back from drastic dips in hydration. New York City dermatologist David Colbert, M.D., meanwhile, combined high levels of hyaluronic acid with firming peptides and ginseng in his just-released NYDG whipped balm, which boosts collagen synthesis to strengthen your complexion at its deepest core. To cancel out redness and fend off windburn, Glossier rebooted its popular priming moisturizer: This thicker version contains barrier-protective ceramides, fatty acids, and murumuru butter, along with the same mix of anti-inflammatory tea and honey as the original (and the texture is light enough to wear under makeup). And to weather the most punishing deep freeze, Sunday Riley’s new botanical-based salve pairs a highly stable form of restorative vitamin C with a medley of nourishing antioxidants and superstar humectants, including glycerin. Pat it on day and night to repair environmental damage—and dwindling moisture reserves—in equal measure. Here, the 10 best ultra-hydrating creams to put into rotation this winter.
