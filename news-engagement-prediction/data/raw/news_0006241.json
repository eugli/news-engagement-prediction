This is the sixth generation for the Japanese automaker’s popular tallboy hatchback and is most significant update that the car has received since it was launched in 1993. It gets a revised design and underpinnings but retains the familiar silhouette that has defined the model.\nNew Wagon R\nFor the Japanese market, the standard Wagon R is available across one standard and two hybrid variants- FA, FX hybrid and FZ hybrid. There are 10 colour options and all models are as standard offered with a CVT. Further 4WD can be fitted as an optional extra on all variants. Powering this Japanese Wagon R is a 660cc three-pot petrol engine producing 51bhp/60Nm of torque. The hybrid variants get a motor that produces 3.1bhp/50Nm of torque.\nThe new Wagon R gets the signature boxy outline but with a new face, tail lamps and larger wheels. As usual, the glass area is massive and thanks to the tall boy design affords a good view all around. Step inside and you are greeted by a centrally mounted instrument cluster, large touchscreen infotainment system and a console mounted gear lever to maximise space between the front seats. Suzuki has stretched out the air con vents across the dash to improve cooling across the cabin. The upholstery trim can be had in shades of beige and or black.\nWagon R Stingray\nThe Sportier sibling of the standard Wagon R, this new car can be had, in the Japanese market, across three variants- Hybrid T, Hybrid X and one non hybrid variant L and with six colour options. This car too is offered with the 660cc three-cylinder petrol engine but here it produces 65bhp/98Nm of torque with the hybrid models getting the option of a 3.1bhp/50Nm electric motor. All variants are only offered with a CVT but all can be had with 2WD/4WD option.\nLike the stock Wagon R, this car gets the same interiors and design but now trimmed out in full black with red coloured inserts above the AC vents. The exterior design gets the boxy outlines but with a revised headlamp design, larger bumpers, slightly modified roofline and larger wheels with heavily flared arches to enhance the sporty design. Projector headlamps and LED DRLs are a part of the standard design.\nPricing\nThe standard Wagon R has been priced in the range of 11, 77, 200 Yen (Rs 7.02 lakh) of 1,394, 280 (Rs 8.32 lakh) while the Stingray has been priced in the range of 12, 93, 840 Yen (Rs 7.72 lakh) to 1, 47, 42, 00 Yen (Rs 8.80 lakh).\nIndia\nWe believe that we will get the updated Wagon R in India possibly in early 2018. However, here it will move to Ignis’ platform as it pretty much similar in terms of dimensions. It will continue to the 1.0-litre petrol engine that produces 67bhp/90Nm with power going to the front wheels via a five-speed MT/AMT. Expect the CNG option to continue with the new car too.", "external_links": ["https://imgd1.aeplcdn.com/642x361/cw/ec/26882/Maruti-Suzuki-Wagon-R-10-Front-view-89592.jpg?wm=1", "https://imgd8.aeplcdn.com/600x337/cw/ec/26882/Maruti-Suzuki-Wagon-R-10-Front-view-89593.jpg?wm=1"], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T11:36:47.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
