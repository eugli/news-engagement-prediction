That friend of mine was still having sexual affairs with her. \n“I had stopped having any sexual relationship with Bukola since I got to know that she has become adulterous. She told me that she was pregnant and I said that I was not responsible for it. \n“My lord, we have stopped leaving together for the past six years, but I have been sending N2,500 every two weeks to her for the upkeep of the child. “I will like to have custody of the child,” Emmanuel prayed the court. \nHowever, Bukola who did not oppose the divorce suit was also silent on the allegation that she was adulterous. \n“My lord, Emmanuel is in no way a responsible husband and father. He had abandoned the child and I for more than nine years and the child can’t even recognise him. “He has sent no money to us for care,” Bukola stated. \nHowever, there were contradictory evidences from the witnesses supporting both Emmanuel and Bukola as to whether Emmanuel was responsible or not. \nEmmanuel resides at Sango-Ota, Ogun State, while Bukola resides at Odo-Oba area of Ibadan.
