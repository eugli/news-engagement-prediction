This is also not good for both countries as they are responding in a tit-for-tat manner,” he told here yesterday. \nHe also said he hoped that Malaysia would quickly start the RC for Thailand or Brunei so that Singapore would rescind its RRC. \nBeginning Feb 15, all foreign-registered cars would have to pay the RRC of S$6.40 (RM20) per entry when they entered Singapore via the Tuas or Woodlands checkpoints. \nSingapore’s Land Transport Authority said the RRC mirrors Malaysias Road Charge (RC ) of RM20 per entry for non-Malaysian-registered cars entering Johor, which was implemented on Nov 1 last year. \nMeanwhile, Malaysian Indian Commerce Association president P. Sivakumar said while it was Singapores right to impose the RRC, he questioned the timing as it was not a good time for the business community. \n“Both governments should be pro business as besides workers, many business people also commute between both countries for dealings,”uch new charges was not appropriate given the sluggish global economy. \nSivakumar added that Malaysia should also look into giving incentives for their RC similar to Singapore, which allows for 10 Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) free days or no VEP during certain hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:33:17.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
