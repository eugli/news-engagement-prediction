I can’t do it again like last year. \n“I’m sorry for swearing and sorry for starting again, can we please start it again? I’m sorry, I can’t mess this up for him. I’m sorry.” \nShe then went on to finish the performance, while images of George throughout his career in music flashed up on the screen behind her.
