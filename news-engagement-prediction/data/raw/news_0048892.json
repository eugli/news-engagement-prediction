But when it happens in the biggest race of the season by a historically close margin, it stings a little. \nMartin Truex Jr. wants to erase that 0.010 seconds margin of victory by Denny Hamlin in the 2016 Daytona 500. He can’t go back in time, but he can do something going forward. \n“I will have to relive that moment the rest of my career unless I win it,” Truex said. “I’ve been asked many times about that finish and from my standpoint I like to think of it as being the closest second-place finisher in the history of the 500.” \nThe closest second-place finish in Daytona 500 history sparked Truex to the best statistical season of his career, winning four races, five poles, and leading the most laps throughout the season (1,809). \nTruex likes his chances to be in position for redemption in the 59th running of the Daytona 500 on Feb. 26 at 2:00 p.m. ET on FOX. \n“You have to find a way to put yourself in position at the end to at least have a shot at winning,” Truex said. “We’ll go after it, no doubt about that, and hopefully, we’ll be there again battling for the win.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:49:34.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
