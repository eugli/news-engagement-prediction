Two alleged victims - who preferred to remain anonymous - have for the first time claimed they were forced to lie down and have water poured over their faces. Speaking to Channel 4's Alex Thomson , one of men, aged just 17 at the time, said he was snatched from the streets and thought he was going to die. He said that in August 1972, the Parachute Regiment - which was in Belfast following Bloody Sunday - had seized a local primary school in the city and took him there. The alleged victim said: 'I was brutalised, a lot of physical beating and kicking. It progressed on to other forms of torture. One of which has now been described as waterboarding. 'It was a cloth tied around my head. I was held face down by the two soldiers and water poured over the back on my head which filled up the cloth. Which was a sensation of drowning. Thinking back on it, it was suffocation.' He added that he was 'convinced' he was going to die after he was subjected to this torture. The revelation comes after President Donald Trump said that waterboarding 'absolutely' works. The 70-year-old said US should fight 'fire with fire' in its efforts to tackle Islamic terrorists and when speaking in an ABC News interview, he said he has asked experts whether torture works, and revealed the answer was 'Yes, absolutely'. Channel 4 News showed that former Irish Prime Minister Jack Lynch (pictured) told Ted Heath about the waterboarding in November 1972 Channel 4 News then showed - for the first time - that Mr Lynch told the British PM about the waterboarding. The pair met for a meeting at Downing Street in London on November 1972. In a secret minute of the meeting, Mr Lynch revealed that a person with epilepsy was a victim of the torture in Northern Ireland. Mr Lynch told the meeting that the man was 'forced to lie down on his back' before water was poured over him to give the 'impression he would be suffocated', reported Channel 4 News.
