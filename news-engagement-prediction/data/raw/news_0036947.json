(Photo: Evan Vucci/AP) \nCan President Donald Trump hold a press conference every day?\nPlease?\nProbably not, but if the one he held Thursday, Feb. 16 — called to announce his new choice to head the Labor Department, Alexander Acosta, but so much more than that — is any indication, there would be no missing it.\nFor an hour and 17 minutes it was impossible to turn away, because there was genuinely no way to know what he might say next. You didn’t want to miss the next thing.\nBouncing back and forth between playful and combative, Trump attacked the media (no surprise there) and, more than three months after the election, Hillary Clinton (weirdly, no surprise there, either). He decried the leaks that have flowed from the White House, but in the same breath said … well, just read:\n“The leaks are absolutely real,” Trump said at one point. “The news is fake.”\nRELATED: Now 'SNL' is practically trolling Donald Trump | Trump takes over primetime TV with real news: Announcing his Supreme Court pick | Trump on Dr. Oz: Everything's a reality show? | Trump the TV critic: 'SNL' skit a 'hit job' | Covering Trump's lies no simple task | Criticize Trump, get a mean tweet? \nHe lamented stories that said chaos reigned so far in his administration. “It is the exact opposite,” he said. “My government is running like a fine-tuned machine.”\nPeople don’t believe the media, he said, and he’s right about that. But why not? At one point Trump said he had won the biggest electoral college victory of any president since Ronald Reagan. As NBC’s Peter Alexander pointed out, this is simply not true.\n“Well, I don’t know, I was given that information,” Trump said. “I was given, I actually, I’ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that?”\nPresident Donald Trump sits at his desk in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on Jan. 23, 2017.   (Photo: AP) \nThat’s but one small example, but what is the media to do with that kind of thing? If a large portion of the country simply won’t believe anything that even reputable media organizations report, things that are demonstrably true — “many of our nation’s reporters will not tell you the truth,” Trump said meanwhile — then what?\nThe answer is easy, in theory if not execution: Keep reporting. Keep telling the truth. Keep grinding out stories that are important and accurate and let the criticism fall where it may.\nAgain, for the people who voted for Trump, this likely falls on deaf ears. Trump spent a lot of time Thursday talking about how the media refuses to report on his many accomplishments, how the tone is relentlessly negative. He campaigned on this message, and many of his supporters agree with him.\nHe evaluated questions as good or bad, depending on whether he considered them combative.\nMORE: Our View: Trump won't give us answers. Congress should find them, anyway |\nIt was bizarre — “I’m not ranting and raving, I love this,” Trump said — and of course it set social media aflame. Regular media, too. CNN’s Jake Tapper — a target of conservatives for his reporting, particularly his questioning of Kellyanne Conway — went on a mini-rant of his own, ending with an admonition for Trump to let the election and his other complaints (“airing of grievances,” Tapper put it, a nod to the “Seinfeld”-created holiday Festivus) go.\n“You’re the president,” he said. “You won the presidency. Now get to work and stop whining about it.”\nThat was pretty striking, but Tapper’s part of the conversation now, so the statement wasn’t that surprising, and neither will the reaction be. This is just more fodder for Trump to go after Tapper. The trick is the workaday reporter covering the White House, slogging through information and turning it into important — and real, not fake — news. The rest is noise, and there’s plenty of that going around.\nIs there anything the president could say or do that his supporters would not defend? Is there anything he could do that his detractors wouldn’t attack?\nNothing comes to mind at the moment. The divide is real and shows no sign of eroding. Better, then, for the media to keep pressing forward. “Truth will out,” Launcelot says in “The Merchant of Venice.” Let’s hope Shakespeare was right.\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com.
