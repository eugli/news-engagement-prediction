They will enjoy hospitality at the association's expense for 10 days. I feel this is a wasteful expenditure and the committee needs to be controlled by the COA or the BCCI,\" the letter from Ranade to Rai stated. \n\n\"Our association is in debt to the tune of more than Rs 300 crores and in spite of this money is wasted for unplanned meetings. Further the association plans to felicitate Test players who have represented Maharashtra before the inaugural Test match without any sanction for the expenses likely to be incurred. \n\n\"Besides they plan to felicitate Mr Shirke as well! It really is surprising that the members still feel the need to do so when the association is in such a huge debt under his leadership,\" Ranade has written.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T14:44:13.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
