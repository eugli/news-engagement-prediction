A show cause notice will be served to consultant doctor of obstetrics and gynaecology, who was on call, for not being available for the emergency surgery despite being informed. \nThe hospital will also provide Rs 10 lakh as compensation to the family along with a job for a family member as “compassionate appointment”. \nNursing officer Rajbir Kaur was admitted to AIIMS on January 16 for a low-risk delivery. The labour was progressing well till 5am after which there was a sudden drop in the foetal heart beat necessitating emergency surgery. Despite the surgery, it was a still-birth and the mother went into cardiac arrest. She passed away on February 4 in the ICU. \nAlleging medical negligence, the AIIMS’ nursing union went on strike and five doctors were suspended without inquiry. This had angered the doctors who then went on strike demanding proper enquiry. \nThe action was taken based on the report of the enquiry committee and two meetings with the director. \nA “displeasure memorandum” of the AIIMS director will be issued to the senior resident of gynaecology involved in taking care of Kaur. A warning will also be issued to a junior resident, anaesthesiology for “having left the operation theatre under pressure of residents of obstetrics and gynaecology’,” the statement said. \nTo prevent such incidents from occurring in the future, the head of the department of anaesthesiology has been asked to ensure round-the-clock availability of senior residents at the maternity OT and a consultant on the hospital premises to supervise anaesthesiology services in diverse areas. \nA committee will be set up under the chairman of the hospital management board to augment services for employees health scheme. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:49:08.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
