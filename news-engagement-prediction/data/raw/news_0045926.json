Our girls are broke! Our dead are walking! The pope's too young! It's a scandal! #shameless.'\" \n\"Tragically,\" Colbert continued, \"Sweden is the third not-a-terrorist attack that has not shocked the world in the last month. First, there wasn't the Bowling Green massacre, then no one was lost in Atlanta. And now it's not Sweden's turn. When will it begin? And just because this attack didn't happen, folks, doesn't mean we don't stand in solidarity with all the people who did not suffer.\" \nHe presented a tribute video, which featured the Muppets' Swedish Chef, ABBA and Swedish meatballs.
