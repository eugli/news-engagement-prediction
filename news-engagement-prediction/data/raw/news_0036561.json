Ozil will play as a second striker (Picture: Getty) \n‘We usually play the second leg here [Allianz Arena] so tonight is a psychological problem,’ said Wenger. \n‘We want a strong defensive performance [but] we have to go fowrard and get the right balance because Bayern have a lot of possession and we need to defend together \n‘I will play with four midfielders with Ozil as a second striker tonight.
