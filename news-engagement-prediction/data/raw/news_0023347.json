Her time of 59.75 seconds was barely off the record of 59.63 set two years ago by King, an Evansville Reitz graduate who went on to Indiana University and won two gold medals at the Rio Olympics. \nWeiss will have another shot at the record in the finals, which start at 1 p.m. Saturday at the Natatorium at IUPUI. \n“If I get that record, it would be a total confidence booster,” she said. “(King) is like one of my biggest role models.” \nThere will be more drama in races than in team scoring, as is usually the case in this meet. Carmel qualified 21 of 22 individual swimmers for championship or consolation finals, all three relays and posted top times in five of 11 events. The Greyhounds’ state title would be their 31st in succession, extending their national record for all sports. \nYet Carmel swimmers are not the machines they might be characterized to be. Coach Chris Plumb said they were tentative early, and they were beaten in the opening 200-yard medley relay, an event they have won in each of the past eight years. \n“Always carrying the idea that we should win hurts us early in this meet,” Plumb said. “Once we get over that, we’re good to go.” \nCoincidentally, Weiss has a tendency to “spin her wheels” early in breaststroke races, Yorktown coach Tony Santino said. She won last year as a freshman, but she has come so far so fast that it’s difficult not to project the future. \nShe is a contender to make the U.S. team for August’s World Junior Championships, also at the Natatorium. And the 2020 Tokyo Olympics? \n“It’s kind of way out there right now,” Santino said. \nA more immediate goal is King’s state record and the national age-group record of 58.80 held by Alex Wash of Nashville, Tenn. Walsh, 15, clocked that time in beating Weiss in December’s East junior nationals at Columbus, Ohio. \nWeiss hasn't concentrated on swimming as long as some of her peers. She abandoned basketball after middle school. It was especially hard to leave softball. \n“That was one of my favorite sports,” she said. “I was a given a gift of swimming, so I had to take it seriously.” CLOSE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:14:29.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
