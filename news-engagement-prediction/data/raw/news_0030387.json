Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid which won nine of the 10 awards it was nominated for in 1971. \nLa La Land has already smashed the record for the most Golden Globes , winning seven prizes last month. \nBut despite its awards success, La La Land has actually now fallen behind Hidden Figures at the US box office. \nThe latter film, about female mathematicians working at Nasa, is up for best adapted screenplay at the Baftas.

Image copyright AP Image caption Amy Adams stars in Nocturnal Animals - which has nine nominations \n\"As if @BAFTA think it's a good idea to put me in the same room as Ryan Gosling,\" tweeted the London-born actress when she was nominated, adding that she was \"very grateful for the recognition\". \nAlso in the running for best British film are American Honey, Denial, Notes on Blindness, Under the Shadow and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. \nIf Meryl Streep's criticism of President Trump at the Golden Globes is anything to go by, though, the biggest headlines of the night could well come from the acceptance speeches. \nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .
