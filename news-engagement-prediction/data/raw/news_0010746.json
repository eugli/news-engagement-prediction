In what was considered to be a veiled attack at Sasikala, the ace spinner had tweeted about the job opportunities opening up with Chief Minister O Panneerselvam and his entire cabinet’s resignation. In his recent tweet, Ashwin joked that it was only a job creation drive and had nothing to do with politics. Earlier today, Tamil Nadu governor V S Rao had accepted Chief Minister Panneerselvam’s resignation but had asked him to hold the office till all other arrangements had been made. This had cleared V K Sasikala’s path to take the oath as Tamil Nadu’s Chief Minister. Guys please cool it down, it is a job creation drive.Nothing to do with Politics. #howmuchtwisting ???? \n— Ashwin Ravichandran (@ashwinravi99) February 6, 2017 To all the youngsters in TN, 234 job opportunities to open up shortly. \n— Ashwin Ravichandran (@ashwinravi99) February 6, 2017 \nOn Sunday, Sasikala was elevated to the post of the leader of the legislature party following a meeting of AIADMK MLAs, paving the path for her to become Tamil Nadu’s next Chief Minister. According to reports, it was CM Panneerselvam who had recommended her name for the post. Chief Minister O Panneerselvam who had taken up the post just hours following the demise of Jayalalithaa tendered his resignation to Governor Vidya Sagar Rao and asked to relieve him and his cabinet citing personal reasons. \nAlso watch: \nThe opposition slammed the AIADMK citing lack of clarification in the functioning of the party. DMK chief Stalin said that Sasikala was not the one people had voted for. Former Finance Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram also criticised the AIDMK over the functioning of the party following Amma’s demise and said that the party was going in the wrong direction. Expelled AIADMK Rajya Sabha MP Sasikala Pushpa also opposed V K Sasikala’a ascension to the post of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister. She wrote letters to the governor of TM V S Rao and PM Narendra Modi alleging that the probable CM had a criminal background and urged them to nominate or invite Sasikala to be a CM. in the letters she said that all the cases against Sasikala were pending and she remained convicted. Rapper Sofia Ashraf pens down a song “My vote isn’t for you”. The singer who shot to limelight for standing up for the people of Kodaikanal against Unilever was seen on the streets at night with her song protesting against the elevation of Sasikala. \nWhile Sasikala’s elevation to the post of the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu seems all but inevitable, protests have started to gain a voice in the state and across political spheres with people complaining that they did not vote for the leader. The opposition has slammed the AIADMK for having an undemocratic approach for the election of the new CM candidate, while the Congress has said that the party was going in the wrong direction since the demise of Amma.
