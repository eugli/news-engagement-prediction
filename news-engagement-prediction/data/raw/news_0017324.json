Image copyright AP Image caption The conference centre was locked down after the shooting \nProsecutors said Kareem had watched jihadist videos depicting violence with Simpson and Soofi, encouraged them to plot an attack to support the terrorist group and researched travel to the Middle East to join IS fighters. 'Not an outside participant' \nKareem told Judge Susan Bolton he \"had nothing to do with this crime\". He said he did not know his friends had been planning to attack the conference and only found out about the shooting after they were killed. \nHe also told jurors at his trial last year that he did not approve of Simpson using his laptop to watch al-Qaeda promotional videos. \nBut prosecutor Kristen Brook argued Kareem had played an active role in helping attempt mass murder. \n\"That just doesn't make him an outside participant or fringe guy,\" she said. Media caption Police officer describes how the Texas prophet cartoon attack unfolded \nHe was convicted of conspiring to support a foreign terrorist organisation and interstate transportation of firearms, among other charges. \nAuthorities also claim he inquired about explosives to blow up the Arizona stadium, which is where the Super Bowl was held that year, before deciding on the cartoon event. \nEarlier this week, ex-convict Joseph Schreiber was sentenced to 30 years in prison for setting fire to a mosque that the Orlando nightclub shooter had occasionally attended. \nSchreiber pleaded no contest and was also ordered to pay $10,000 (Â£7,986). in compensation, despite damages to the mosque exceeding $100,000.
