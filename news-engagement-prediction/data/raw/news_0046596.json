Speaking to Spanish outlet ABC he said, “Mourinho's Madrid didn't know how to lose. They played dirty.” \nJose Moruinho remains so far the only manager since 2008 to lift the La Liga title and the only manager to prevent Pep Guardiola from winning the league. He is known for his defensive style of football and found a way to contain that Barcelona team. In case you didn’t know... \nDani Alves had several run-ins with Cristiano Ronaldo and the two did not exchange pleasantries during the 2015 Ballon d’Or ceremony but since then have buried the hatchet and are now on good terms. The heart of the matter \nThe comment from Dani Alves shows he hasn’t forgotten his past with Real Madrid. He is hated by the Madrid fans for his supposed antics on the pitch but what’s even more surprising is him claiming Barcelona don’t treat their players properly. \nTowards the end of his time with the Catalans, he was rumoured to leave almost every season until he finally did last summer. But it is not surprising Alves made the comments he has about Jose Mourinho. \nThe ‘Special one’ has made more enemies than friends during his managerial career and Dani Alves seems to be part of that list. But the comment also seems to be somewhat of a compliment. \nHis quote about his teams not knowing how to lose is a testament to how difficult it was to play his teams. Being the only Real Madrid side since the last decade to win La Liga it’s no doubt Mourinho’s teams garner so much attention. What’s next? \nAlves is on course to winning yet another league title with Juventus this campaign. Even at the age of 33, the Brazilan is going strong. He plans to go into music once he retires from football something that suits him pretty well. Sportskeeda’s take \nDespite Dani Alves claiming Real Madrid play dirty, it is probably more of a defensive tenacity than anything. There have been several scuffles and one of the more violent ones when Jose gouged Tito Vilanova’s eyes was arguably one of the dirtiest El Clasicos in recent history.
