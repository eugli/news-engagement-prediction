Unfortunately for him, KZ’s knockout wasn’t even the most incredible thing to happen in Houston that weekend. A day after Chan Sung Jung punched out Bermudez, the New England Patriots completed the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history, beating the Atlanta Falcons in overtime in and ensuring that no one will be talking about the UFC around the water cooler at work today. The monumental nature of the comeback is all anyone could talk about last night, including many MMA fighters and especially UFC President Dana White . Check out their reactions to the big game below.
