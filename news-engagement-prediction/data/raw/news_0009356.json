Kirsty had filled out a form online saying she had been bullied and was depressed (Photo: Daily Record) \nThe source said: “The system failed to keep this poor girl safe. She was a known self-harmer and she should have had extra care.” \nAnother picture she shared read: “I’m that one friend. The one who walks behind everyone else. \n\"The one that no one really notices in the group. The one that people forget to include. The one that is always there for others but never has anyone to be there for me.” \nAs well as sharing a video admitting to being self-harmer, Kirsty filled out a quiz online saying she had been bullied and admitting to feeling depressed. \nThe day after her suicide on December 30, friends shared pictures of the teenager and tributes. \nOne close pal wrote on a picture of Kirsty: “Gone but never forgotten.” Another added: “She will be missed.” Kirsty's Facebook post before she committed suicide (Photo: Daily Record) Read More Mum releases shocking pictures of schoolboy left for dead after thugs smashed his skull \nA police spokeswoman confirmed her death was not suspicious. \nShe said: “We can confirm that at around 3.40pm on Friday, December 30, police received a report of a 13-year-old girl being found injured within a property on Marine Parade, Dunoon. \n“She was taken by ambulance to the Cowal Community Hospital where she later died. \n“The girl has been formally identified and relatives have been informed. \n“The death is not being treated as suspicious and a report has been submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.” \nA review into the tragedy is being compiled by Argyll and Bute Council and will be sent to the Care Inspectorate, who will decide whether further investigations need to be carried out. \nThe Care Inspectorate said the case would be reviewed.
