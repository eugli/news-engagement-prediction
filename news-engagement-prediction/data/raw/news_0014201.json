The album earned 131,000 equivalent album units in its first week. \nTwo days before the official numbers came in, the Atlanta rappers considered what having a No. 1 album would mean to them. \"It would mean everything, but with everything in the world, hard work pays off,\" said Quavo on the red carpet before their performance at the New Era \"Planet New Era\" party on Friday (Feb. 3) at VRSI nightclub. \"We speaking for the young generation, we speaking for the young generation of music.\" Added Offset: \"The Culture wave, we speaking for the youth.\" \nMigos' 2015 debut, Yung Rich Nation , peaked at No. 17 and moved 18,000 copies in its first week. The key difference this time around, the group says, was capitalizing on their trend-setting abilities. \"We took our time with it,\" continued Offset. \"We gave you the point. It's points that's given [on the album] that's already should have been pointed out that we pointed out about ourselves, leading the trend of music.\" \nDuring Super Bowl weekend, Migos not only went jewelry shopping and flaunted blinding bling on the carpet, but snapped a pic with NFL Hall of Famer Emitt Smith, who was the muse for the trio's 2013 song named after the all-time leading rusher, \" Emmitt Smith .\"\"He a real playa, he a real cool dude,\" offered Offset. Takeoff also noted the meeting was \"a dream come true.\" Check out who I met in Houston... @Migos ! pic.twitter.com/WVH7V6yV6B — Emmitt Smith (@EmmittSmith22) February 3, 2017 \nBefore performing Culture cuts at the New Era celebration, like \"T-Shirt,\"\"Get Right Witcha\" and \"What the Price,\" the North Atlanta reps opened with \"Call Casting\" and a snippet of \"Emmitt Smith,\" which had the former Dallas Cowboys running back standing and jamming along from his VIP section.
