Time for me to look at what’s next inside and outside the cage. New chapter starting right now,” Letourneau wrote. \n“And don’t feel sorry for me! For those who know me for years, you all know and I know that every time I thought the worse was happening, it was to take me to something 10 times better and I feel that this is what’s happening. This is best for my health and future. I am good, I am happy, I still love my sport and I still gonna fight if my fans, sponsors and promotion have my back. And if not! I’m still gonna be fine.” A post shared by Valerie Letourneau (@valerietroubleletourneau) on Feb 16, 2017 at 1:47pm PST \nLetourneau joined the UFC in 2014 while competing at bantamweight, where she picked up a win in her debut before making the move down to 115-pounds. \nLetourneau found instant success with a pair of impressive victories, including a win over Maryna Moroz, that ultimately earned her a title shot against Jedrzejczyk in 2015. \nWhile Letourneau came up short that night she battled it out with the strawweight champion for 25 minutes, but then fell to defeat in her next fight as well when she lost by TKO to Joanne Calderwood eight months later. \nLetourneau then lost a very close split decision to UFC newcomer Viviane Pereira last December and now it appears her run with the promotion has come to a close for now at least.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:41:39.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
