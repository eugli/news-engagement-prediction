A + A - Jalebis are a must-have before winters go away for good. Picture courtesy: Pinterest/Kankana: Playful Cooking \nFreshly-made, hot jalebis, dripping chashni or rabdi--yes, that's just the stuff made of dreams. We're sure you had quite a bit of these throughout winter. But with spring approaching like a super-fast train, the weather isn't going to be ideal for gorging on jalebis for long. \nJalebis, also known as zulbias, are one of the most popular snacks in South Asian countries. But having them in summer just isn't as satisfying as having them in winters. So before the nip in the air disappears completely, you should indulge a bit more. And if you're tired of having the same old flour jalebis soaked in sugar syrup, try these five instead. \nApple \nYes, you read that right. Apple jalebis are a hot favourite that you shouldn't miss out on. You'll need: 2 apples, peeled, cored, thinly sliced; 3/4 cup all-purpose flour; 1/2 tsp active dry yeast; 1/2 tsp sugar; 1 tbsp oil. Syrup: 1 cup sugar; 1 cup water; 1/4 tsp cardamom powder. Apple jalebis are sweet and succulent. Picture courtesy: Pinterest/Vegan Richa \nMix the flour, yeast, sugar, and yeast together in a large bowl. Add some warm water, and make a smooth batter. Set the batter aside for half an hour. Boil the syrup ingredients together in a pan for 10 minutes. Set the syrup near the stove, so that you can transfer the fried jalebis easily. Heat some oil in a separate pan. Dip the apple slices in the batter, coat them properly, and fry them in the pan one or two at a time (over crowding will make them stick together). Once the slices are fried, take them off the oil, and soak them in the syrup for a few minutes. Follow the same process with the other slices. Serve the jalebis while they're hot. \nAlso read: 3 chocolate-filled desserts that are guaranteed to make your period blues disappear \nChocolate \nIf you like everything chocolatey, this easy jalebi will be your best friend.
