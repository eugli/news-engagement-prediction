Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com TownNews.com Content Exchange \nJUPITER, Fla. • Dexter Fowler put an immediate charge into the Cardinals’ offense Saturday and he didn’t even make contact. \nThe new center fielder walked twice in his only two plate appearances, stole a base and scored two early runs. But the Cardinals lost to Miami 8-7 in an exhibition game which featured five home runs, including two off Cardinals closer Seung Hwan Oh, who will leave for his native Korea on Sunday to join his World Baseball Classic team. \n“I try not took at those things too much in spring training,” said Oh, through his translator, “But because things like that happen, I have to go back and look at ways to get better. \n“I’m going to come back better.” \nMatt Carpenter had a two-run homer and Harrison Bader a solo homer for the Cardinals. Jedd Gyorko had two singles in two at-bats while playing third base. \n\"I like how our lineup looks right now,\" new first baseman Carpenter said. \"I hope it stays that way.\" \nStarter Luke Weaver pitched out of a bases-loaded, no-out spot in the first of his two innings, allowing just one run. The two teams play again on Sunday at Roger Dean Stadium when the Cardinals will be the home team. \nBADER CUTS LEAD TO 7-6 \nHarrison Bader, the top Cardinals’ outfield prospect, ripped a homer in his first at-bat of the spring in the sixth inning, cutting the Miami lead to 7-6 in exhibition baseball Saturday. \nThe righthanded-hitting Bader, a University of Florida product, had a collective 19 home runs last year at Class AA Springfield (16) and Class AAA Memphis. \nCARDS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TWO MORE WALKS \nThe Cardinals took advantage of two more walks by Miami pitchers in scoring two runs in the fifth inning Saturday to take a 5-4 lead over the Marlins in exhibition baseball. \nJordan Schaefer and Chad Huffman both walked. Greg Garcia delivered a perfect sacrifice bunt to move runners over. Stephen Piscotty’s grounder to third, which was booted, scored one run and Carson Kelly’s deep sacrifice fly scored the other. \nThrough the first five innings, the Cardinals, opportunistic, had just three hits out of the infield, one of them Matt Carpenter's two-run homer, but had five runs. \nBy the end of the fifth, though, the Marlins had seven runs as lefthander Austin Gomber, who had pitched around a leadoff double in the fourth, wasn't as successful in the fifth. Gomber surrendered a two-run single by Matt den Dekker before pitcher/outfielder Schaefer made a diving catch in center field to end the inning. \nFOWLER WALKS AGAIN; CARPENTER DELIVERS \nDexter Fowler, the Cardinals’ new leadoff man, walked for the second time in a row as he hit in the third inning. The old leadoff man, Matt Carpenter, followed the second of those walks with a two-out, two-run homer to right off Miami’s Dustin McGowan and the Cardinals had a 3-1 lead in exhibition baseball. \nFowler had scored two of the runs without getting a hit \nSeung Hwan Oh, making his lone appearance for the Cardinals before he flies to Korea to join his nation’s team for the World Baseball Classic, allowed a rarity _ two home runs an inning. After Christian Yelich tied the score with a two-run drive to right in the third, Justin Bour hit a solo homer to give the Marlins a 4-3 lead . \nFOWLER BRINGS NEW LOOK \nThe new look Dexter Fowler was supposed to bring to the Cardinals arrived in the first inning of the first exhibition game Saturday. \nFowler, the new leadoff man for the on-base-percentage challenged Cardinals, drew a five-pitch walk from Miami’s Edinson Volquez. He stole second on a 2-0 pitch to Greg Garcia and went to third on Garcia’s long fly ball to center field. Fowler then scored the game’s first run, sliding home as he touched the plate with his right hand, after Matt Carpenter’s lined sacrifice fly to center field. \nOne run, no hits. That didn’t happen very often last year when the Cardinals scored 44 percent of their runs via home runs. \nCardinals starter Luke Weaver walked two of the first three men he faced, with the other, J.T. Realmuto, singling to open the Marlins’ first. But Weaver kept the rally at a game-tying one run as he induced Giancarlo Stanton to roll into a double play, Realmuto scoring, and retired Justin Bour on a groundout. \nCARPENTER, MOLINA IN LINEUP \nFowler was in center field. Other regulars in the lineup were Matt Carpenter at first base, Yadier Molina catching and Stephen Piscotty playing right field. \nJedd Gyorko, who led the club with 30 homers last year, is at third base, and Matt Adams is serving as the designated hitter. Even National League teams can use the DH for about the first half of the exhibition schedule. \nRighthander Luke Weaver will start for the Cardinals and will work either 40 or so pitches or two innings. \nCloser Seung Hwan Oh will pitch one inning for the Cardinals and then take off on Sunday for Korea, where he will join his nation's team for the World Baseball Classic, which will begin in a few days. \nJohn Gant, Austin Gomber, Sam Tuivailala and Zach Phillips also are tabbed to pitch for the Cardinals Saturday. \n“It’s time,” said manager Mike Matheny. “We always talk about how long spring training is but whenever we get to that point where we start playing games and let them start to compete, that’s when you can really tell. \n“(With) most of the guys, it’s a matter of getting their timing ready. This year, it’s a challenge of getting the (World Baseball Classic) guys ready to go so they’re at their peak when they’re ready to compete for their country. But. . .with the young players, I really enjoy seeing some of them play that I’ve never seen play before.” \nFor instance, former Illinois State third baseman Paul DeJong will play shortstop on Saturday. “The guy keeps opening our eyes as to what he potentially might be able to do,” Matheny said. “A young player with a big upside that maybe no one had penciled in at shortstop, but continues to show that he potentially could be there.” \nDeJong hit 22 homers, drove in 73 runs and batted .260 for Class AA Springfield last year before performing strongly in the Arizona Fall League. Greg Garcia will play second as former University of Hawaii teammate Kolten Wong will rest a tender shoulder another day before playing. \nA. GARCIA TO BE BROUGHT ALONG SLOWLY \nCuban outfielder Adolis Garcia, signed to a $2.5 million minor league contract on Friday, will be brought along slowly in Cardinals’ camp this spring, Matheny said Saturday morning. \n“He’s a specimen, I’ll tell you that,” said Matheny. “Obviously (he’s) a really good runner. He sounds like an all-around athlete. We talk about athleticism and it seems like he fits that bill. But. . . it’s going to take a little while before we can see it out there on the field, as far as the games go. We’ll have to go slow here. It’s been a while since he’s competed but it looks like he’s in plenty good shape.” \nGarcia was the Most Valuable Player in Cuba’s top league last year and was declared a free agent in December by Major League Baseball. \nCARDINALS LINEUP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T03:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:04:13.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
