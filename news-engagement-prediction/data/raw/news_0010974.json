The Vols entered the season with two proven star running backs in Jalen Hurd and Alvin Kamara and a promising prospect in John Kelly . \nPlans change, though. \nKelly emerged as a really good player, but Hurd stunningly opted to leave the Tennessee program midseason and Kamara missed some time with a knee injury, leaving the Vols no choice but to get Fils-aime on the field, albeit in a limited role. \nFils-aime — the nation’s No. 12 running back in the 2016 industry-generated 247Sports Composite — showed flashes of promise in his reserve role, collecting 58 yards and two touchdowns on just 14 carries. He also showed his youth, though, when he bumped into senior quarterback Joshua Dobbs and caused a costly fourth-quarter fumble in the Vols’ upset loss at South Carolina. \nTennessee running backs coach Robert Gillespie and offensive coordinator Larry Scott — who was the team’s tight ends coach last season — said last week that redshirting Fils-aime would have been the preferred path, but that they were proud of the former Naples (Fla.) High School star for making some plays and still really excited about the back’s future. (Photo: Randy Sartin, USA TODAY Sports) \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?

The newly-promoted coordinator said the sophomore-to-be is already a much more confident figure around the Anderson Training Center on a daily basis, and that he “stepped up big-time” to help the Vols’ 2017 recruiting efforts. \n“You know what? He’s done a really good job, I think,” Scott told 247Sports. “Every kid is different when they come in. Some take a little bit longer to develop and mature and transition and those type of things. I think it was a bit of a transition for him early when he got here. It was kind of like, you know, you’re talking about drinking through a fire hose. It was kind of drinking through a firehose for him. It was his first time away from home. But as we went through the season, you saw him mature and grow a little bit more week by week by week. \n“We were very pleased with where he was coming out of the bowl practice and the bowl prep, the way that he did things and the way he was running the football, and now you see his personality starting to come through. He’s around the building, he’s helping us recruit. He’s found his niche. \n“The light bulb has kind of turned on for him, and we’re expecting big things from Carlin.” (Photo: Tennessee athletics, UTSports.com) \nFils-aime was known primarily for his speed in high school, and rightfully so, because anyone running by South Florida athletes as often as he did is fast. \nWhat might surprise people, though, is Fils-aime’s strength. He’s still listed at 5-foot-11, 175-pounds, but he’s starting to look a little bigger than that, and he’s never been bashful in the weight room. \n“He’s one of the strongest guys on our team, pound-for-pound,” Gillespie. “He’s a really strong kid.” \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .) \nScott said he wasn’t surprised to see Fils-aime and highly touted high school teammate Tyler Byrd look like fish in water in the weight room last season, because coach Bill Kramer’s Naples High School program is known for its strength and conditioning department. \n“We weren’t surprised,” said Scott, who has recruited that area for years as an assistant at South Florida, Miami and now Tennessee. “If you know that high school program and where he’s from, the Naples High School program in known for that toughness; great weight room program that Coach Kramer runs down there. Carlin’s a byproduct of the program that he was in down there in high school. \n“He and Tyler are both very strong kids. They’re not allergic to the weight room. They love that part of it, because that’s been a central and core part of their development since coming into high school.” \n\nContact Wes Rucker by email at wesrucker247@gmail.com or ON TWITTER , or FOLLOW GOVOLS247 ON FACEBOOK .
