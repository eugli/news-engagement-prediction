Was it?” the president quipped as Mr Gorsuch and his wife joined him on stage. \nMr Gorsuch, 49, a federal appeals court judge in Denver, was the youngest of the jurists that Mr Trump eyed for the vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia ’s death last year. The son of a Reagan-era cabinet official, Mr Gorsuch has a reputation for writing well and hewing closely to constitutional tradition. \n“I pledge that if I am confirmed, I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the constitution and laws of this great country,” said Gorsuch, a graduate of Harvard Law School who clerked for Justices Anthony Kennedy and Byron White. \n“Neil Gorsuch is a superb pick,” said John Malcolm, a legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation. “The president could not have picked a justice closer to the mould of Antonin Scalia.” \nMr Trump originally had planned to announce his selection on Thursday, but moved faster amid mounting controversy over his temporary ban on refugee admissions and travellers from seven Muslim nations. \nIn the hours before the ceremony, both Mr Gorsuch and a second finalist, Judge Thomas Hardiman of Pittsburgh, were brought to Washington. The unusual attempt to build suspense for the court pick drew comparisons on social media to Mr Trump’s reality television hit “The Apprentice.” \nIf confirmed, Mr Gorsuch would restore the high court to the 5-4 conservative-liberal split that existed before Scalia’s death. Within hours of Mr Trump’s statement on Tuesday, advocacy groups on both sides of the partisan divide were engaged in the campaign-style combat that has characterised recent Supreme Court nominations. \nThe conservative Judicial Crisis Network said it had booked the first $2 million of a planned $10 million broadcast and digital advertising campaign to boost the nominee. The ads will appear in Washington, DC, and four Republican-leaning states that are represented by Democratic senators: Missouri, Indiana, North Dakota and Montana. \nCarrie Severino, the group’s chief counsel, said Democratic senators up for re-election in 2018 would be held “accountable” for their votes. \nLikewise, progressive groups, still bitter over Republicans’ refusal last year to consider President Barack Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland, plan to fight for what they consider a “stolen seat” on the high court. \n“Democrats in the Senate, and progressives and liberals who care about the unprecedented nature of that theft by Republicans, shouldn’t roll over for Donald Trump,” said Brad Woodhouse, president of Americans United for Change. \nDemocratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon vowed on Monday to filibuster Mr Trump’s eventual nominee. Republicans in the Senate would need 60 votes to end debate, meaning they would need to attract at least eight Democrats to their side if they avoided any defections. \n“At the end of the day, I expect the nominee to be confirmed,” said Malcolm who drafted the original list of conservative judges that Mr Trump considered for the court. \nIn choosing Mr Gorsuch, the president passed over a candidate who shared the blue-collar background of his most enthusiastic supporters. Hardiman, 51, who sits on a federal appeals court in Pittsburgh, is the son of a taxi driver and the first person in his family to graduate from college. \nHe serves alongside the president’s sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry and is known as a strong supporter of law enforcement and gun rights. \nTuesday’s primetime spectacle was unusual but not unprecedented. In 2005, President George W Bush introduced his choice to be chief justice, John Roberts, in a televised White House ceremony. But unlike Mr Trump, Mr Bush did not bring any of the runners-up to the Executive Mansion. -30- Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.
