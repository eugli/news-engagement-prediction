On an average, an Indian techie earns $ 1,00,000 per annum in the US. \nThe offshore business model has now come under a cloud after US President Donald Trump’s vow to give jobs back to US citizens. A new US bill is also likely very soon. \nExperts also said Indian software engineers in the past have matched and at times surpassed Sidharth’s salary. \nIn 2015-16, two students from IIT Kharagpur were hired by software giant Google for annual packages of Rs two crore each. The two, Araknath Pathak and Abhishek Pant, had topped the computer science and engineering department. \nIn 2015 too, Google had hired a student from DTU for an annual salary of Rs 1.27 crore. \nIn 2014, a student from IIT-BHU was picked up by Google for an annual salary of Rs 2.03 crore. \nThe same year, 20-year-old Jaipur girl, Astha Agarwal of IIT Bombay, bagged an offer of Rs 2 crore from Facebook. \nThe year 2014 was, in fact, remarkable for international recruitments with Facebook, Oracle and Google making at least 40 offers with packages exceeding Rs 1 crore to Indian students. \nThe demand for Indian engineers was such that tech behemoths went to smaller campuses of tier 1 engineering institutes. \nGoogle picked up Krunal Kishorbhai Patel from BITS Pilani’s Goa campus for Rs 1.4 crore. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:17.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
