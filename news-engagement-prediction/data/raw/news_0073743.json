Find out here Staff Reporter /Dubai   12.11 pm Share Vote \n(Alamy) The eclipse will begin in South America before crossing the Atlantic Ocean and making landfall in Africa. Starting tomorrow at 7 AM EST (4PM Dubai time) Slooh will host a special live show chasing the Moon's shadow across the southernmost part of the globe, following the path of an Annular Solar Eclipse. Slooh's livestream will feature live feeds of the event from both continents, capturing both the annular phase in Chile and the partial phase in countries like South Africa, bringing together our global network of feed partners. During the broadcast, host Gerard Monteux will guide viewers on this journey across multiple continents and thousands of miles. Over the course of the show, he'll be joined by a number of guests who will help viewers explore not only the science of eclipses, but also the fascinating legend, myth, and spiritual and emotional expression associated with these most awe inspiring celestial events. An Annular Eclipse is similar to a Total Solar Eclipse, in that the Moon moves directly between the Earth and the Sun, but the Moon is farther away from the Earth, making it appear smaller. Therefore, the Moon only covers most of the solar disk leaving a \"ring of fire\" around the outer edge.
