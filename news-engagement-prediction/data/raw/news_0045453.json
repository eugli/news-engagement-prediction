The motion means that any undocumented migrant will have full access to local services without fear of being turned in or deported. \nThe motion was passed by Montreal city council on Monday, and was initially put forward by Mayor Denis Coderre, who is also a former Canadian immigration minister. — DenisCoderre (@DenisCoderre) February 20, 2017 \nAddressing the press, Coderre said Montreal has the means to take care of the refugees living there, and that it was time for the city to take action. \n“ [We can provide] healthcare, housing, integration. A lot of these people are victims. They’ve been victims of terrorist acts, they’ve been kicked out of their country or left because of their situation – from sexual orientation to political refugees. Some of them have been here six, seven, eight years. “We have the capacity to provide services under our own jurisdiction, so when we are talking about housing, when we are talking about basic service – we will be able to do that,” Coderre said, as cited by CTV News.

Those without documents will be subject to assistance from Montreal police without being reported to immigration officials. \nThe Montreal authorities also called on the Quebec government, which is responsible for provincial immigration, to ensure the refugees are granted access to healthcare and emergency services, while urging the federal government to regularize the status of undocumented migrants. \n“ The bottom line is to integrate them. And if you don’t have a criminal case [or pose a security risk], we will normalize your situation. You will be able to remain here,” he promised.According to Global News, there may be as many as 50,000 undocumented migrants in Montreal. \nThe mayor noted that he saw the need to act after recent events in the United States. More and more people have been crossing the US border into Canada illegally, after US President Donald Trump launched a crackdown on illegal immigration and proposed placing restrictions on refugees. \nCiting Canada’s border services agency, the Star reports that some 452 people filed claims for refugee asylum at Quebec-US land border crossings in January.

Ottawa, Saskatoon, Winnipeg and Regina are also mulling over the idea, according to CBC. Vancouver is not a sanctuary city, but it last year adopted an ‘Access to City Services Without Fear’ policy for undocumented residents or people with uncertain immigration status. \nAs of December last year, the US had roughly 300 sanctuary cities, counties and states, including New York and Washington, according to data from the Center for Immigration Studies. However, President Trump recently threatened to cut federal funding to such cities if they fail to cooperate with his stated plans to deport undocumented residents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:12:15.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
