The embankment is home to 75 to 125 addicts at any given time and is, as the article states, \"a hidden hellscape\" just four miles outside of Center City. \n\nReddit and in the comments section on Philly.com. As of this writing, more than 84,000 people have read about El Campamento. \nshared this idea: \"Philadelphia needs a supervised injection facility. Heroin addicts will not disappear when the tracks are clean. They'll overdose alone elsewhere. Calling addiction stronger than a 'bond between a woman and child' is sexist and stupid. Why don't you look at why these people are getting high? Ask them what would help them stay safe and, if they're ready, get treatment. Fear mongering like this doesn't offer viable solutions and will divert resources (millions of dollars apparently) that could be used for harm reduction that actually helps PEOPLE, to resources that help sell CONDOS. Get it together.\" \nwrote, \"I believe any drug testing done must be matched by easy access to detox and rehabilitation programs. Its an addiction - if people could stop by themselves they would have. I find it interesting that so many Congressman who smoke cigarettes don't feel empathy toward people addicted to stronger drugs.\" \n, \"If Kenny [sic] wants the area cleaned up he should do it. He is so anti business he wont stop until he forces every taxpaying employer out of the city.\" \nHe writes , \"This epidemic lies at the feet of pharmaceutical companies. And medical doctors who prescribe opioids like candy.\" Our readers also feel strongly about Philly's rapidly changing neighborhoods and the role those changes play in the day-to-day lives of some of our most vulnerable citizens. \nhttps://t.co/73UCnzKIDt \nEdward M.

Using the label of addict as often as you have here is just lazy journalism. Learn the impact your words have. You have a role to play in saving lives in this current crisis as well.
