The person broke through the front door using an axe to smash the glass,\" manager Stuart Jones said. \n\"They entered the premises and went initially for cash — cleaned out the tills — and returned to take about 10 bikes.\" \nAbout $1,000 was stolen along with their a van, but Mr Jones said the bikes were their biggest loss. \n\"The value of the bikes was a lot higher. It was around $40,000 retail value,\" he said. \n\"It was fairly clear that they were going for bikes with price tags on them.\" \nMr Jones said it was a \"devastating\" attack on their business. \n\"It's a real kick in the guts for a local businessman to be working hard and running a small business and just to have this happen,\" he said. \nCCTV has been given to police and the van has also been recovered. Wine bar owner felt 'violated' \nOn Monday a number of restaurants and bars were also targeted. \nRachel Bell from Avenue C Wine Co said it was important other businesses were warned about what was happening. \n\"Anywhere between 3:00am and 5:00am on Monday ... somebody came through the door with a sledgehammer,\" he said. \n\"He caused a massive mess. [He] didn't take any alcohol, and managed to find some money. \n\"Then they've gone through next door also ... he definitely went on a rampage.\" \nAbout $500 was stolen during the incident. \nMs Bell said as a small business owner she felt \"violated\". \n\"We are only a brand new business. We have only been open five months, so obviously we are only starting out. It cost us money on Monday because we could not open,\" she said. \nMs Bell said it was surprising the crimes had not received any coverage in the media for almost a week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:09:53.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
