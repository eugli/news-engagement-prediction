And they’re waging this battle by focusing in on superfluous non-important issues, citing unnamed sources, and the press has called this president every name in the book.” \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:06:05.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
