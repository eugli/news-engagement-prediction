The Dow gained 120.6% during President Barack Obama’s eight years in office, ranking sixth among presidents. \nThe benchmark S&P 500 has jumped 10% since the election on the hope that Trump will deliver on his promises of corporate tax reform and fewer regulations. The index, which closed at 2,362.82 on Wednesday, has already eclipsed the average year-end forecast among Wall Street analysts, according to Bloomberg . \nThe financial sector has been the poster child of the rally as investors see the big banks benefitting from deregulation and higher interest rates. Goldman Sachs’ shares contributed the most to the gains of the Dow Jones industrial average, which on Wednesday closed at a ninth-straight record high for the first time since 1987. \n“We believe we can get back to sustainable [economic] growth of 3% or more,” Mnuchin said. \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
