Her mother died when she was two, and she was raised by her father and, later, a stepmother, Anna Haldeman. Her father was an active politician as well as a wealthy businessman and active church member. He was one of the founders of the Republican Party, elected to the Illinois State Senate from that party in 1854 and serving until 1870. \nJane Addams graduated from Rockford Female Seminary in 1881, among the first students there to take a course of study equivalent to that of men at other institutions. She was valedictorian. Her father, whom she admired tremendously, died that same year, 1881. \nJane Addams attended Woman's Medical College in Pennsylvania, but she left the college, probably due to her ill health and her chronic back pain. \ncontinue reading below our video Profile of Jane Addams Jane Addams toured Europe 1883-5 and then lived in Baltimore 1885-7, but did not figure out what she wanted to do with her education and her skills. \nAt the time, an educated woman usually had few options outside of teaching school or becoming a missionary. She later described this as a woman's choice between the \"family claim\" and the \"social claim\" -- to serve through having a family, or to serve society more broadly through social service work. Settlement House \nIn 1888, on a visit to England with her Rockford classmate Ellen Gates Starr , Jane Addams visited Toynbee Settlement Hall and London's East End. Jane Addams and Ellen Starr planned to start an American equivalent of that settlement house. After their return they chose Hull mansion, a building which, though originally built at the edge of the city, had become surrounded by an immigrant neighborhood and was by then run down and being used as a warehouse. \nUsing an experimental model of reform -- trying solutions to see what would work, adapting as experiments worked or didn't -- and committed to full- and part-time residents to keep in touch with the neighborhood's real needs, Jane Addams quickly built Hull-House into an institution known worldwide. Much of her funding came from wealthy women in Chicago. Addams wrote articles, lectured widely and did most of the fund-raising personally and served on many social work, social welfare and settlement house boards and commissions. Her approach, which also stressed the role of women in social welfare, was sometimes called social feminism. \nHer first conception of the settlement house as a place for educated women to raise the cultural level of the poor fairly quickly evolved into an understanding that social services like child care, visiting services, rooms for young working women, and classes for immigrants were more important. She developed her ideas into a robust theory of democracy as the empowerment of and participation of all members of the community. More Social Reform \nThe Pullman strike of 1894, following a depression the year before, brought Addams' attention to the larger issues behind the individual struggles of those who were poor. Her 1894 essay, A Modern Lear , analyzed the Pullman Strike by comparing George Pullman to King Lear. She became involved in the Progressive movement and its wider efforts for social reform, including housing and sanitation issues, factory inspection, rights of immigrants, women and children, pacifism and the 8-hour day. \nThe work of Addams and the residents of Hull-House to survey the neighborhood carefully, published as Hull-House Maps and Papers in 1895, was key in the founding of the scientific study of social conditions. Her emphasis on not just data collection, but acting on the results, helped shape the early profession of social work. \nShe worked closely with University of Chicago faculty. John Dewey not only taught Greek philosophy to the Greek immigrant men coming to Hull House, but consulted with Addams on her work, and named his daughter after Addams. Sophonisba Breckinridge and Edith Abbott , also at the University of Chicago, drew Addams into influencing the early years of the School of Social Work at the University. \nShe served as a Vice President of the National American Woman Suffrage Association from 1911-1914. \nIn 1912, Jane Addams campaigned for the Progressive Party and its presidential candidate, Teddy Roosevelt. She worked with the Peace Party, helped found and served as president (1919-1935) of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and was a founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). \nMany of the leaders of progressive social reform, both in Chicago and nationally, were residents of Hull-House , including Frances Perkins , Florence Kelley , Alice Hamilton , Mary Kenney O'Sullivan and Mary McDowell . Nobel Prize \nIn 1931 Jane Addams was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , shared with Nicholas Murray Butler, but her health was too fragile to attend the European ceremonies to accept the prize. She was the second woman to be awarded that honor. \nJane Addams died in 1935. \nBooks by Jane Addams, many of which were edited compilations of earlier essays and magazine articles, include Twenty Years at Hull-House and Democracy and Social Ethics . \nIn 1963, most of the buildings which had come to be included in what was called Hull-House were torn down to make room for the University of Illinois, Chicago campus (then called Circle campus). All that is left today is the original mansion and one more building. These are now used as a museum and educational site.
