Oh. Yeah, destroy him!' I’m all for destroying Barkley. You know, Barkley talks a lot. A whole lot for a guy who has not won a championship, which I've stated multiple times. I think Shaq should talk about the champions. Kenny should talk about the champions. Ernie can talk about the champions. When it comes time to speak about someone who has a championship, Barkley should be muted. \n\"They should have some type of graphic up there where you can like, you know how on, what is it, (ESPN's debate show) 'Around the Horn' where they just ice somebody out on the screen?\" Green said. \"They should be be able to do that with Barkley any time the name of a champion comes up.\" \nBarkley maintains his \"whiny\" comment was right , and he refused to make things personal with James after the Cavs star brought up several ugly incidents from Barkley's career . When Green saw Barkley's reaction, he walked back his elation and admitted that James may have taken things a step too far. \n\"I thought that was incredible when I first read that,\" Green said. \"Then, I looked back to see what Barkley said, and then my reaction was like, 'Ah, 'Bron. I don't know if you needed to go that deep, 'Bron.' For me to feel like that about Charles Barkley, 'Bron really had to cut deep. He went deep for something that wasn't as deep.\" \nMORE: LeBron, Wade and Carmelo won't get drowned by drama \nBut Green added some perspective and considered the fact that James has been criticized by Barkley and other prominent members of the sports media for the majority of his career, even when it wasn't warranted — cough, Skip Bayless, cough . \n\"It was an accumulation of things, though,\" Green said. \"So when you look at the accumulation of things, how long Barkley been on TNT now? Probably 10 years? Just say 10. (Barkley joined \"Inside the NBA\" in 2001.) So this is what, year 15 for 'Bron? (This year marks James' 14th season in the NBA.) So we go short end of the stick and say 10, that's 10 years 'Bron been listening to this guy just ramble, ramble, ramble. He just be yapping. \n\"So when I heard that, I said, 'Okay, kill him 'Bron.' I like that. I like to see somebody destroy Charles Barkley like that. Then I stepped back and I said, 'Okay, that's a little too far 'Bron.' Then I thought about it again and I was like, 'Hmmm. That's an accumulation of stuff.' Hey, may the best man win, and I think 'Bron won that one.\" \nJudge Green has slammed his gavel, and he doesn't see any way Barkley can come back with an appeal. \n\"Listen, in the day and age we live in, if it was some real dirt, then we would already know about 'Bron.\" \nCase dismissed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:36:22.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
