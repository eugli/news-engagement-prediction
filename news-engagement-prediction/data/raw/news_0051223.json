And it’s now risen close to 150% from the lows struck in early December 2015. \nQuite the recovery. \nMetal Bulletin said the continued surge was once again driven by steel prices. \n“China’s spot rebar prices continued to surge on Tuesday on the back of big gains in the billet market,” the group said. “The price of billet rose to its highest in four years. This gave a big boost to spot rebar prices.” \nAnd that may have been driven by a resumption of infrastructure investment after the Lunar New Year holiday. \n“Revival of infrastructure investment has been driving demand for steel and hence iron ore,” Wang Fei, an analyst at Hua’an Futures, told Reuters. \nThe gains in the benchmark price outpaced those in lower grade ores, no doubt assisted by renewed strength in coking coal and coke prices following a decision from China to ban imports from North Korea late last week. \nHigher grade ores allow steelmakers to reduce the amount of coking coal required to produce steel, hence tend to benefit when coal prices increase. \nHowever, after rallying 5% in the first two trading days of the week, there’s signs that the bullish run may be coming to an end. \nChinese futures all fell overnight, something of an anomaly given the price action seen in recent weeks. \nThe May 2017 iron ore future fell 0.62% to 723 yuan, a sharp reversal on the levels seen during Tuesday’s day session. \nRebar, coking coal and coke futures also went into reverse, sliding 1.1%, 1.6% and 2% respectively. \nSHFE Copper ¥49,250 , 0.10%", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:52:02.252+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
