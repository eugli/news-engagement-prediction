(Elsa/Getty Images) \nThe moment for which so many Bears fans have waited so long seems to be rapidly approaching. The team is “actively” trying to trade Jay Cutler, as first reported Tuesday by ESPN’s Jeff Darlington . \nChicago expects trade talks to intensify during the NFL scouting combine, which starts next week in Indianapolis. Every team will be well-represented there, as the Bears look for the best offer they can get for Cutler. [ These five prospects are going to dominate the combine ] \nHow much of a market actually emerges for the quarterback, who turns 34 in April, remains to be seen. Cutler has always had better-looking physical tools than actual results, and he was effectively benched last year in favor of journeyman Brian Hoyer. \nBetween thumb and shoulder injuries, Cutler appeared in just five games, and he completed 59.1 percent of his passes for 1,059 yards four touchdowns and five interceptions, while going 1-4. His 2.9 touchdown percentage was the lowest of his career, and his 78.1 rating was the second lowest. \nStill, there are always teams around the league with their own major problems at quarterback — the 49ers and Jets come to mind — but that raises another issue mentioned by Darlington. While Cutler has four years left on a contract extension he signed in 2014, there is no more guaranteed money left in the deal, meaning that he would lack that incentive to report to a team which traded for him but whose situation he didn’t like. The Bears could, of course, simply release Cutler, which would likely be just fine with many of the team’s supporters. [ Why Tony Romo would be a huge upgrade for either the Broncos or Texans ] \nBetween his inconsistent performances and aloof personality, Cutler has become quite a polarizing figure among Bears fans. That is, some fans think he’s acceptable while others despise him. \nAn obituary last year in the Chicago Tribune for woman who died at the age of 78 described her as a “lifelong fan of the Cubs, Blackhawks and Bears (except Jay Cutler).” Nationally, he doesn’t fare much better, with one Q-score survey last year finding Cutler with one of the worst negative ratings of any athlete mentioned. \nIn eight seasons with the Bears, following three with the Broncos, Cutler has become Chicago’s all-time leader in most major passing categories, including yards, completions and touchdowns, but that may say as much about the franchise’s checkered history at that position as it does for him. The team appeared ready to move on last season, and it could select a highly touted quarterback prospect with the No. 3 pick in the draft. sports Get the top Olympics news by email Major news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens. post_newsletter333 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:43:01.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
