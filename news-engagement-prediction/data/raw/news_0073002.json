Grey's Anatomy debuted in 2005 and centers around a group of medical residents and interns living in Seattle and trying to balance their personal lives with busy medical careers. The show has featured many actors and actresses who have become big-name stars, such as Katherine Heigl, Patrick Dempsey and Ellen Pompeo. \nAnd many visitors come to Seattle wondering where the intern house owned by fictional Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is located. Supposedly on the show Grey inherits the pricey home from her mother and grandmother. Where is the Grey's Anatomy house? \nThe fictional living place for the interns is found at the following coordinates: 47°37'49\"N 122°21'39\"W on historic Queen Anne Hill . The fictional address on the show is at 613 Harper Lane. But there is no such street on Seattle's Queen Anne Hill. \ncontinue reading below our video Long-Haul Flight Survival Tips \nIf you want to drive and check out the real-life home of the interns the address is 303 Comstock Street, Seattle. The house is not one interns could typically afford. The $1.3 million dollar home was built in 1905 and includes four bedrooms and 2.5 baths with 2,740 square feet of living space. Queen Anne Hill is a neighborhood perched above Seattle Center and it's one of the highest hills in Seattle. You can spot it from all around the city by the three antennas that rise up from the hill, and it's mostly a quiet neighborhood. If you drive by the house, be courteous as it's someone's home. \nIf you don't live in Washington state or aren't planning to visit anytime soon you can check out the Grey's Anatomy home using this overhead map . Other Locations Used in Grey's Anatomy \nThe house at 303 Comstock is not the only filming location from Grey's Anatomy in Seattle, but as with many shows, some shots that appear to be in Seattle are actually studios or other locations. \nFisher Plaza is used for exterior shots of Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital and helicopter ambulances land on the helipad on top of that building, the same one used by local news channel KOMO, which is headquartered at Fisher Plaza. \nSeattle natives may recognize some outside shots too. Magnuson Park has made an appearance or two in the show. \nHowever, many hospital scenes are done at VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California, and not actually in Seattle. Most scenes are filmed in Los Angeles-area studios, too. \nOther Things to See Nearby \nQueen Anne Hill is pretty centrally located, so there's plenty of other things to see and do in the vicinity of the Grey's Anatomy house. \nQueen Anne Hill is home to Kerry Park, one of Seattle's best viewpoints. You'll get a top-notch view of the city skyline from this perch, making it a great photo op. \nExplore Queen Anne Avenue, which is near the top of the hill. This is where many of the neighborhood's local businesses are. It's not a huge commercial district so has a lot of charm, and it's a great place to grab a bite to eat or a cup of coffee. \nIf you enjoy walking, Queen Anne Hill can offer a pretty good workout. It's a hill and it's steep. The homes in the neighborhood are historic and beautiful to look at while you climb, too. \nLower Queen Anne Hill, the side of the neighborhood that's adjacent to Seattle Center, is filled with all kinds of restaurants, local shops, cafes and other businesses to explore. \nSeattle Center is worth exploring as well, especially if you haven't been before. This is the location of the Space Needle, EMP Museum, Pacific Science Center, KeyArena and International Fountain. It's not uncommon to find a festival livening up the grounds, but no matter when you go, Seattle Center is great for a stroll.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:08:06.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
