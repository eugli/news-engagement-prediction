Holding that Punjab government cannot be allowed to defy its order, a bench of Justices P C Ghose and Amitava Roy said that it would not accept any excuse of the state government for not implementing its order. The court said that it would pass order on execution of its decree if warring states of Punjab and Haryana failed to come to an agreeable solution. \"There are two orders by the court earlier and also a reference on the issue. Canal has to be constructed. The decree has to be executed either through legal process or parties themselves sit together and find out a solution. If Haryana and Punjab fail to sort out then we have to pass order,\" the bench said. The court said that the controversy had been going on for years and it was time to bring the curtains down on the dispute to pave the way for construction of canal. \"Enough is enough. We are keen to finish it. We don't want to keep the matter pending,\" the bench said while rejecting the plea of Punjab government requesting the court to post the case after March 11 when the election result of assembly polls would be declared. Senior advocate Ram Jethmalani and R S Suri, appearing for Punjab, told the court that the dispute could not be effectively resolved through legal process and the court should asked the Centre to find out political solution. \"Centre is duty bound to play the role of a mediator in the inter-state water dispute to uphold the spirit of federalism. In the present case Union of India has not shown any pro-active approach in sorting out the water issues between the states. Centre should convene a meeting to find out solution instead of Court passing order on the issue,\" Jethmalani said. Solicitor general Ranjit Kumar said that although the apex court had directed for implementation of SYL project, the Punjab Termination of Agreement Act had not been formally declared invalid. Agreeing with his plea, the bench said that it would pass a formal order on quashing of the controversial Act on the basis of its earlier order. Jethmalani also drew court's attention to the proposed agitation launched by a political party to redig the canal. He said that around one lakh people were likely to participate in the procession scheduled on Thursday which would create law and order problem. The court then asked both Punjab and Haryana to take all necessary steps to maintain law and order. It said that its status quo order on the project would continue and posted the case to March 2.
