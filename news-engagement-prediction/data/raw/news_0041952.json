Instead of singing 'Happy Birthday,' we're going to set it off just like this...\" \nInstead of the traditional birthday tune, the Young Money MC waited a moment for \"Work,\" his 2016 mega-collaboration with the Barbadian titan, to play for the crowd. \"You better sing this s**t for RiRi's birthday right now,\" he shouted. \nDrake isn't one to be shy about his feelings towards the Bad Gal. Back in August, he shared his love for the pop star when presenting her with the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award at the 2016 VMAs. \"She's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old,\" he said at the time. \"She's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life, I've looked up to her, even though she's younger than me.
