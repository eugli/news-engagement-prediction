Whether they can both get the touches they need to keep those averages up, however, remains to be seen. \nWith a 23-34 record, the Pelicans are currently 2.5 games behind the Denver Nuggets for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference and 9.5 games behind the Oklahoma City Thunder for the No. 7 spot. \nClimbing into the playoff mix won't be easy, even with Boogie on board, but the Pelicans needed to try something to give Davis some help. To be able to land Cousins for a 2017 first-round draft pick, Tyreke Evans, Buddy Hield and Langston Galloway was simply too good of a deal to pass up. \nThursday night's matchup against the red-hot Houston Rockets, who currently hold the No. 3 spot in the West, will be a good test for the new-look Pelicans, who can't afford to have any growing pains with their star duo if they're going to earn a playoff spot this season.
