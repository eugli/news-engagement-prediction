Eater has asked local food expert Mikol Hoffman for her picks of the hottest openings of the past 12 months or so. \nLike so many other cities, San Juan is in the midst of a food hall revival, whether in the more traditional model ( El Mercado de Paseo Caribe ) or a more low-key outdoor version ( Lote 23 ). San Juan is also crushing on global food capitals like Lima ( Mercado de Lima ) and Rome ( Bocca Osteria Romana ). There's also a gorgeous new brunch destination ( Sabrina Brunch & Bistro Bar ) and a boundary-pushing new cocktail bar ( La Coctelera ). \nLooking for the essentials? We've got you covered . But for only the newest and hottest, here's the first-ever Eater Heatmap for San Juan: 1 Touro Restaurant \nWith the launch of Touro, renowned chef Martin Louzao (Cinco Sentidos Group) reaches the height of his creative and culinary expression. The five- or eight-course tasting menu and its elaborate wine and cocktail pairing take you on an interactive and multi-sensorial ride through the foods and utensils of yesteryear, albeit with local ingredients and modern touches. There’s also the elaborate tapas menu with over 44 options to choose from, and at the botanical-style bar, world-class bartender Joey Fernández experiments with tonics, bitters, and rum, resulting in intriguing concoctions.
