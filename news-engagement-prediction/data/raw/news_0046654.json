Ag Pres Osinbajo \nHe said: “This is the meeting of Presidential Task Force on Rice and Wheat and we reviewed the wheat programme and what we can do more to support states in order to increase production of wheat. \n“To ensure that our farmers, who have responded to the call are supported in terms of getting good price for their output in order to sustain their interests. \n“We reviewed where we are with rice production, the Acting President noted with satisfaction all the efforts be different stakeholders to attain sufficiency in the shortest possible time. \n“The Acting President assured the meeting that the Federal Government will continue to support the drive towards self sufficiency in food security. \n“He said the government of necessity will support the farmers, the millers and other stakeholders involved in the value chain.” \nThe governor added that more states other than the previous fives, had joined in the production of wheat, to bring the number to eleven. \nHe said Nigeria was on course towards achieving self-sufficiency in rice and wheat production. \n“I think we have done very well, we have remarkable increase in the number of states that have produced wheat from the last season. \n“Last season we had about five states but today we are hearing reports from about 11 States and the increase in output per state is quiet significant as well. \n“So we believe that with sustained trajectory that we are seeing we will be able to achieve our self sufficiency,” he said. \nThe governor, however, could not confirm if Nigeria was the second largest producer of rice in the world as he didn’t readily have the statistics. \n“I don’t have that data but I know that our farmers have responded and all parts of Nigeria, about 32 states, have increased production,” he said \nThose who attended the meeting include governors of Ebonyi, Dave Umahi; Kano, Abdullahi Ganduje; Kebbi, Abubakar Bagudu; and Jigawa, Badaru Abubakar. \nThe M inister of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Chief Audu Ogbeh, his counterpart in Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun, as well as governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emiefele, were also in attendance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:19:28.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
