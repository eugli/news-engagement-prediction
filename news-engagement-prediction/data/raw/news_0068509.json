By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 22, 2017 2:36 PM Samajwadi Party leader and former Uttar Pradesh Minister Shivpal Yadav on Wednesday hinted that he won’t compromise his ministerial berth if his party wins and Akhilesh Yadav becomes the Chief Minister. (ANI image) \nSamajwadi Party leader and former Uttar Pradesh Minister Shivpal Yadav on Wednesday hinted that he won’t compromise his ministerial berth if his party wins and Akhilesh Yadav becomes the Chief Minister after March 11. The much discussed feud between the uncle and the nephew had grabbed all headlines before the ongoing Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2017. “Since I am contesting on SP ticket, I am in the party. After March 11, if I don’t get ignored or insulted then I will remain in the party.” Talking tough, Shivpal ruled out campaigning for Congress candidates. “I don’t want to go where Congress candidates are contesting,” Shivpal said. Shivpal, however, said, he will “campaign for Samajwadi Party candidates.”“I am with Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav). I will do whatever he wants me to do,” Shivpal said. \nShivpal earlier had hinted that the police lathi charge on people in Jaswantnagar was on the directions of “someone”. But chose to not take any names. Shivpal looks to have again found a way to diplomatically attack his nephew Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. He said the administration didn’t even ask people to move and promptly started a lathi charge when there was a chaos over malfunctioning EVMs and people’s name missing from voter’s list. “The administration was working on someone’s direction,” said Shivpal. “Prashasan ne hatne ko nahi kaha,sidhey lathi charge kar diya.Shaasan kisi ke ishaare par kaam kar raha tha,” said Shivpal. \nWatch this video \nDuring the voting people complained about malfunctioning EVM machines and said that their names were not in the voter’s list. Some chaos was created and police resorted to lathi charge after facing trouble in dispersing people. \nFighting to redeem some of his lost pride in his native constituency, the 61-year-old brother of SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav is banking on sympathy of 3,65,535 voters after being sidelined by nephew Akhilesh Yadav. If it is anything which has can be termed as positive for Shivpal at election time, it is the sympathy of the voters who have had a personal association with him for decades. \nHe might have been thrown out of the ministry but is still regarded as ‘mantriji’ here and does not need to remind voters of his works and personal help that he has rendered to the locals. Though today he is treading the path alone with no bigwig coming over for campaigning, the support of his elder brother Mulayam, who started his campaign with a rally for him, has reestablished the bonding in the family. \nJaswantnagar, part of Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat, was represented by Mulayam who had won the seat first time in 1967. Winning it for eight terms he lost on two occasions he left it for Shivpal, who has won it four times since 1996. In the last elections in 2012, Shivpal polled 1.33 lakh votes, beating his nearest opponent of Bahujan Samaj Party by over 80,000 votes. \nManish Yadav is the BJP contestant, but it appears to be of no major concern for Shivpal who believes he is on a safe wicket in the Yadav family stronghold. BSP has fielded Durvesh Shakya in a field of 10. \nIn the previous elections, Shivpal had not spent much time in his constituency since he had to shoulder the responsibility of the state with his brother. This time he is not even in the list of SP’s star campaigners and thus has enough time for his constituency. \n(With agency inputs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:03:25.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
