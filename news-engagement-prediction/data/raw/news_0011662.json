They stole it.”\nJohansson plays The Major, a robotic soldier with a human mind who is part of a task force known as Section 9, which works to combat cyber criminals and hackers, and come up against an enemy working to sabotage Hanka Robotics. Along the way, The Major learns some troubling things about her past. \nWhile the film has attracted considerable controversy over Johansson’s casting, the trailers and this new spot seem to have alleviated some concerns about the film’s look and feel. We don’t have much longer to wait and see: Ghost in the Shell hits theaters on March 31st, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T01:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:36:33.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
