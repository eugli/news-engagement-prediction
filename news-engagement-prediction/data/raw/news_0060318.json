Perhaps this photoshoot is why she chopped off her long locks ? Either way, we‚Äôre all ears for some Dove Cameron music to drop. \n‚ÄúI‚Äôve been promising my fans an album for some time now. I‚Äôm making a lot of moves in that direction,‚Äù she shares. When asked what kind of style or sound her fans can expect, she remained pretty tight-lipped so as not to give too much away. \n‚ÄúIt is definitely going to be what a lot of fans would expect for me, but then I think for a lot [of fans], not what they would expect from me,‚Äù she said. Galore \nIt all sounds very mysterious, but from what we can tell Cameron definitely has a few tricks up her sleeve. ‚ÄúI have a lot of influences and I don‚Äôt want to give anything away about the things I‚Äôm currently working on,‚Äù she added. \nWell, while we don‚Äôt know too much about Cameron‚Äôs music projects, we do know she plays one hell of a Marilyn Monroe and totally slayed this photo shoot.
