Ben Barba in action for the Sharks. Source: News Corp Australia \nLast year he added a premiership ring to his trophy cabinet with Cronulla. \nBut those achievements have been clouded by off-field drama that’s followed Barba throughout his career. \nHe was stood down by the Bulldogs in 2013 for a code of conduct breach, then tapped on the shoulder by Broncos coach Wayne Bennett the following year and told he was surplus to requirements. \nEarly in 2016 he was granted time off from Cronulla after news of a scuffle with teammate Sosaia Feki and a subsequent bust-up with partner Ainslie Currie emerged. \nThen there was the positive cocaine test following the Sharks’ grand final celebrations, which resulted in his immediate release and a trip to Thailand for rehab. \nBarba was asked if he never played rugby league again, was he happy with how his career had gone. \n“That’s a bit of a tough one, you could say yes and no,” Barba said. \n“Obviously I would have liked it to run a bit smoother than my career did go. \n“But I won two pretty special awards in the game, if I leave and don’t come back I’d be happy with how everything went. \n“I’ve done some pretty special things but I’m ready to move on.” \nBarba says he was taken out of context last week when he made a comment to media outside his home to the effect of “The NRL hasn’t given me much”. \nHe explained he was referring to the recent lack of communication surrounding his ban from training, rather than over his career as a whole. \n“That got taken way out of context. I think it was more around the fact they hadn’t given me much that I didn’t know what was going on,” he said. \n“As I said I didn’t know when I was allowed to go back to training, when my contract was going to be registered, when I was allowed to actually join the team. \n“That stuff was all a bit confusing because like I said they didn’t give me too much on the actual rules.” Hayne could leave in 2018 1:34 \nTHE DECISION TO LEAVE \nBarba’s decision to pack up and head to France to play rugby shocked the NRL community. It followed weeks of uncertainty surrounding his career after news of the positive cocaine test came to light. \nHe was slapped with a 12-game suspension by the NRL, but had hoped of being given permission to train with Cronulla during his suspension, which the governing body was yet to confirm. \nThen Toulon came knocking. \n“It was pretty crazy. I guess when I made the decision (to leave) it was a bit of a relief to be honest, my mind could rest for once,” Barba said. \n“It’s been a whirlwind few months, not knowing anything or if I was coming back to league, when I was allowed to train, when I was allowed to play was a bit too much for me in the head. \n“When I made the decision to pursue rugby it was a bit of a relief and I could think a bit straighter. \n“To be honest it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster — the grand final and everything that’s gone on after that. The month in Thailand, coming back, and just the rollercoaster of not knowing what’s going on. Ben Barba celebrates Cronulla’s premiership.

To get over there and see what it’s all about, hopefully it all works out.” \nRUGBY AND HIS BIG GOAL \nBarba played rugby union through high school but says he hasn’t played a game since he was 17 years old. \nHe knows the adjustment period will be a tough one but he’s still carrying some lofty ambitions. \n“I love every sport, I played the game when I was younger and I enjoy watching it,” Barba said. \n“It’s not unknown to me, and as I said it’s a very exciting time for me and something I’m looking forward to, getting over there and putting it to the test. \n“There’s still some things I don’t know in the game, but there’s a lot of things that I already know so like I said I don’t not know anything about it.” \nBarba was most at home playing at fullback in rugby league, and that’s where he hopes to make a name for himself in rugby, too. \nHe hopes to trade the No.1 jumper straight in for a No.15. \n“Definitely, that’s where I feel comfortable. It’s a bit different to the fullback role you play here in rugby league,” he said. \n“But I’m sure they will have a plan for me over there, the coaching staff, hopefully I can catch on pretty quick and I can get out on the field and put myself in the game.” \nIf it all goes smoothly and the Wallabies come calling?

She’s pretty tough and we’ve got great support with my managers, and even still the Sharks family. \n“The partners and wives have been pretty supportive in asking if she needs help, they’ll be there to support her. \n“She’s a pretty tough girl and I’m sure she will take care of it.” \nQueensland NRL fans, get excited.
