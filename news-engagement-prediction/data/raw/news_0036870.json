White House via YouTube \nUS President Donald Trump again teased the prospect of placing a \"big order\" of F/A-18 Super Hornets to a cheering crowd at Boeing's South Carolina factory on Friday. \n\"We are looking seriously at a big order\" of F-18s said Trump to applause from the crowd at Boeing, the company that builds the F/A-18. \nTrump's Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis announced in January that the military would \" review \" the F-35 program and possibly opt for more \" advanced Super Hornets \" instead of the F-35C, the Navy's carrier-based variant of the Joint Strike Fighter that continues to struggle. \nTrump continues to seriously explore the idea despite backers of the F-35 program have protested the notion that an updated F-18 can do the F-35's job. \nThe advanced Super Hornet package offered by Boeing builds on the company's reputation for delivering upgrades to the F-18, first built in the 1970s, on time and on cost. \nThis contrasts heavily with the Navy's F-35C, made by Boeing rival Lockheed Martin, which has faced significant difficulties achieving readiness in the military. \nDan Gillian, Boeing's vice president of F/A-18 and EA-18 programs, told Business Insider that even with the coming F-35C naval variant, US carrier air wings would consist of a majority of F/A-18s into the 2040s. In fact, Boeing has contracts currently underway to update the F/A-18s. \nF-35C Lightning IIs, attached to the Grim Reapers of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 101, and an F/A-18E/F Super Hornets attached to the Naval Aviation Warfighter Development Center (NAWDC) fly over Naval Air Station Fallonâ€™s (NASF) Range Training Complex.
