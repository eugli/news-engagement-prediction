The list includes an array of the city's most-famous eateries, including Pok Pok, Aviary, Beast and Bollywood Theater (the full list is below). Pok Pok's Andy Ricker organized the effort. Enlarge Portland restaurateur and Pok Pok founder Andy Ricker is leading the fundraising drive… more The restaurants will give 10 percent of their take to the ACLU's Oregon chapter in response to, among other actions, the Trump administration's executive order on immigration. Nationally, the ACLU has raised some $10 million since the Jan. 27 order was issued. Many of the restaurants will make donations on two days during the long President's Day weekend. Aviary, for instance, will donate 10 percent of its Friday and Saturday sales while Bollywood Theater will donate its share on Saturday and Sunday. Ricker began reaching out to local chefs last Friday, according to KGW, a PBJ news partner . We reached out to Ricker by email to get more details on the drive. Was there one single thing or moment that inspired you to organize this? No, it's been building. I first started thinking about this when the travel ban was enacted. I started thinking about all the promises Trump made on the campaign trail and chief among them were several antii-immigration policies (build a wall, deportation drive, etc.) and figured it was only a matter of time before he delivered on them as he had with the Muslim travel ban. Then it was just a matter of pulling the trigger and reaching out to the other restaurants in Portland who I knew were thinking about the same things I was. Who's in? Here's a list of the ever-growing restaurants participating in this weekend's fundraising event for Oregon's ACLU chapter. 24th & Meatballs, 87th & Meatballs, Angel Face, Apizza Scholls, Associated, Ate-Oh-Ate, Ava Gene’s, Aviary, Beast, Beer Belly, Bollywood Theater, Chefstable Group, Clyde Common, Coopers Hall, Country Cat, EaT: An Oyster Bar, Ecliptic Brewing, Expatriate, Fire & Stone and Foster Burger. Grain & Gristle, Grassa, Gravy, Hot Lips Pizza, La Moule, La Taq, Lardo, Loyal Legion, Luce, Mediterranean Exploration Company, Mi Mero Mole, Miho, Mississippi Pizza, Multnomah Whiskey Library, Navarre, Noble Rot and Nonna Tavern. Observatory, Old Salt, Over and Out, Ox, Pambiche, Phillippe’s Bread, Pine Street Biscuits, Podnah’s Pit, Pok Pok, Por Que No, Radar, Real Good Food, Restaurant St. Jack, Roman Candle, SuperBite, Toro Bravo, Tusk, Woodsman Tavern, Xico, XLB, and Yakuza. There are \"more than 50\" restaurants as of right now: Will more be joining as the day goes on? As many as want to [can join]. It is very loosely organized, intentionally so. All I asked was that everyone do it on the same day(s) and that there be one place we donated (ACLU), which everyone will do individually and to the amount of money they are able. We have a hashtag — #ImmigrantsWelcome — but are asking participants to use their own social media network to get the word out. I realize it's very early, but do you anticipate being able to do this more often during the next four years? As long as there is an anti-immigrant mindset within the government, I am sure folks in this business will do their best to make it clear that we all need immigrants to be supported. We are a nation of immigrants and immigrants are the lifeblood of the restaurant and food industry.
