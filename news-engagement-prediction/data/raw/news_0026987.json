He then visited another hospital and narrated the same story. \n\"He drove us around for five hours and took us to four other hospitals including the AIIMS Trauma Center and Hindu Rao hospital. Each time, he went in and returned with the same answer,\" she said. \nHalf an hour after Rohit died, Vasanti contacted her husband and they took him to a hospital where he was declared brought dead. \nThe boy's mother told police that minutes after her son died, Rahul even threatened to lock her up in the car and set it on fire.
