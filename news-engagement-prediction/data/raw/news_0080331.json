Mr. Sisi, who came to power in 2013 after the military ousted his predecessor, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, has not yet said whether he will stand for election. But at this point, it is hard to see how an effective opponent could emerge. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Sisi and his supporters exert a powerful grip on the security forces, politics and the media. Thousands of political rivals are in jail or in exile. In recent months, the government has gone after prominent lawyers and rights activists with prosecutions that have frozen their bank accounts, rescinded their ability to travel abroad and could ultimately imprison them for lengthy terms. “We are approaching critical times, and the regime needs to eliminate any possible competition,” said Rabab el-Mahdi, a political scientist at the American University in Cairo. “They want to curtail the public sphere, and cracking down on Sadat, one of the few career politicians who posed any threat, is part of that.” \nAdvertisement Mr. Sadat is the second person to be expelled from Egypt’s Parliament in the past 12 months. Tawfiq Okasha, a television presenter turned politician, was expelled in March 2016 after he had dinner with Israel’s ambassador to Egypt. \nAdvertisement In a phone call Monday evening, an aide to Mr. Sadat declined to speculate on whether Mr. Sadat might run for president, saying it was “too early to consider.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The one issue on which Mr. Sisi has proved vulnerable is his decision to bequeath two Red Sea islands , Tiran and Sanafir, to Saudi Arabia during a visit by the Saudi king last year. That decision caused a nationalist backlash that led to rare public protests and litigation in the Egyptian courts . But the election of President Trump, who has lavished praise on Mr. Sisi, has given heart to Egyptian officials. During a phone call in January, Mr. Trump invited Mr. Sisi to the White House. Since then, Egyptian ministers have been preparing for the trip, as well as a list of requests. “With Trump in power, they feel they are assured that everything will be fine,” Ms. Mahdi, the analyst, said. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story With the silencing of Mr. Sadat in Parliament, Hussein Gohar, an official with another opposition party, said politics had become a dispiriting and perilous pursuit in Egypt. “Honestly, I never know what will happen next,” he said. “Every time I travel abroad, I never know whether they will stop me.” \nNour Youssef contributed reporting.
