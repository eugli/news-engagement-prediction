Hiding oil spill risk analysis does nothing to protect the pipeline from terrorists. It’s absurd, ” he stressed. \nThe Army Corps of Engineers has also objected to the company’s motion, noting that many of the documents they wish to seal have already been made public with redactions by other agencies. \nDakota Access disagrees, however, arguing that the information would “ have no relevance to the Litigation, ” and a protective order will not affect the ability for the plaintiffs to conduct the litigation. \nThe Obama administration halted construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in December, but President Donald Trump has made it a top priority to complete the construction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:36:07.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
