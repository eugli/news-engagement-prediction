Photo: Andrew Meares \nThe chief executive of Sydney University's US Studies Centre, Simon Jackman said: \"If it comes off, the symbolism would be high and the imagery would be stirring.\" \nThe Australian and US navies joined to fight the undefeated Japanese fleet at the Battle of the Coral Sea and managed to break Japan's relentless drive south, a threshold moment of World War Two. Advertisement \nA commemoration with the two leaders on the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Intrepid, a veteran of the Pacific War and now a floating museum, would recall shared history and suggest renewed purpose. \nProfessor Jackman added: \"The unpleasantness of the phone call between Turnbull and Trump would be very much in the rear view mirror. It would be the consummation of a more normal relationship between the Trump administration and the Australian government.\" \nBut the battle was fought from May 4 to 8 and the budget is due on May 9. \nAn Australian official said: \"The anniversary of the beginning of the battle falls on the Thursday before the budget, and there's usually some major decisions left to the Thursday and Friday before the budget papers are printed on the weekend. It's a moving feast,\" as to whether the two could be accommodated. \nForeign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop concluded a relationship-building visit to Washington on Thursday. \nShe held her first meetings with Vice-President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Mr Trump's newly announced National Security Adviser, Lieutenant-General H.R. McMaster. \nMs Bishop said she took the opportunity, while US policy was under review, to give Australia's view on key issues including the South China Sea, North Korea's nuclear program and the anti-Islamic State campaign in Iraq and Syria. \nOn the fighting in Iraq, Ms Bishop said: \"I certainly gave an indication of the outcomes we would like to see and focused on what the US would see as success â€“ what would be the US definition of success in Iraq? That's been missing so far.\" \nIn a busy season of diplomacy, Mr Turnbull is to welcome Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Saturday and farewell Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday. \nThe leaders of Israel and the world's biggest Muslim-majority state, countries that do not recognise each other diplomatically, are both scheduled to be in Sydney.
