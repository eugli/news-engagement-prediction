The Catholic Church expressed alarm over the killings of more than 7,000 people so far since President Duterte assumed office June 30 of last year. AP Photo/Bullit Marquez   President Rodrigo Duterte upholds freedom of expression, Malacañang stressed Sunday, after thousands of people joined a Catholic Church-organized rally against extrajudicial killings and the revival of the death penalty. “The president allows the freedom of expression and this is one of them. That’s part of the democratic dynamic,” presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella when asked for his reaction to the “Walk for Life” held last Saturday. The event, which was organized by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, was held at the Quirino Grandstand in Manila and was attended by more than 10,000 people. Duterte and the Roman Catholic Church have been clashing over the administration’s bloody war on illegal drugs and its effort to bring back capital punishment. The president has waged a brutal war against narcotics, a problem that he claimed has reached “epidemic proportions.” More than 7,000 suspected drug offenders have died since the intensified anti-drug campaign was launched, worrying Catholic bishops who believe that killing is not the solution to the problem. Duterte has denied endorsing extrajudicial killings but has ordered government forces to shoot drug suspects if they pose any danger to their lives. The Roman Catholic Church, the religious group of more than 80 percent of Catholics, is also against the revival of death penalty, one of the priority bills of the Duterte administration. The president had said that death penalty is not a deterrent but a retribution for wrongdoing. He even threatened to execute five to six drug convicts every day once the bill reviving death penalty is passed into law. Angered by the Church’s criticisms against his war on drugs, Duterte had claimed that bishops have no moral ascendancy to lecture him about the sanctity of life because of the corruption and child abuse scandals involving some clergymen. He had also encouraged the public to maintain a personal relationship with God without going through Catholic rituals. Bishops were unfazed by Duterte’s tirades and vowed to continue to speak out against the killings and other wrongdoings. Last week, Malacañang said the government is open to collaborating with the Church but maintained that the bishops should make the first move.
