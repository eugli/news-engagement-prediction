But it wasn't until recently that I realized that Tictail is more than one adorable shop, it's a huge online marketplace selling home decor and fashion from independent brands around the world—and yet I somehow still want all of it. RIP 2017 budget, you're a total goner. \nWhat is Tictail? With offices in both Stockholm and New York, Tictail is an online marketplace where independent sellers and emerging brands can open up shop. It's both a straightforward website and an easy-to-use app. At first glance, the selection may seem endless to sort through, but Tictail will helpfully tailor the choices to your taste. When you start browsing, you'll be asked to choose several brands to follow, multiple products you like, and some fellow shoppers whose curated lists you admire. These picks will help Tictail narrow in on similar items. If you have a relatively consistent style—particularly if you're a fan of Scandinavian minimalism, Memphis style or mid-century modern—you will quickly feel like this site was made just for you. \nHow is it different from Etsy? As a diehard Etsy fan, there will always be room in my heart (not so much my wallet) for both. While Etsy focuses on the individual makers or artisans and is our go-to for customized items, Tictail emphasizes and supports emerging brands and has a slightly more polished, less bespoke vibe. If you're looking for an arm-knit blanket , Etsy is your best bet, but if you want a stylish dishware set, Tictail should be your first stop.
