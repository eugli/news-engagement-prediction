REIGNS' HATERS \nNow, it looks as if we’re heading towards a WrestleMania clash between The Big Dog and The Undertaker, another prospect fans aren’t excited by unless Reigns turns heel.

Article continues below \nHe said: “Roman Reigns is talented, I don’t care what anyone says. You can’t deny that the kid knows how to work. TOO MUCH, TOO SOON \n“I believe what happened to him was that they didn’t have him go through the ringer. They didn’t have him win the European title, or I should say, the Intercontinental title, U.S. title, King of the Ring. They just threw him up there right away and fans don’t like that. \n“They want you to earn your keep. If any wrestler has ever done that, I don’t know of one. It seemed like they were really trying to push Roman faster than he should have been pushed.” \nThe Olympic gold medallist knows the push has had flaws, and it was obvious that they gave him too much, too soon. \nHowever, Angle – who will be inducted into the Hall of Fame this year – doesn’t expect that push to stop, even if fans continue to boo. \nHe added: “I think he will earn the respect of fans, but it’s going to take a little bit more time. \n“For Vince McMahon, it’s not a difficult choice. You keep Roman Reigns in the picture and you just continue to push him. \n\"And eventually, someday, it won’t be the half and half, 50 and 50 [where] 50 [percent of the crowd] like him and 50 don’t. \n“Eventually, it’ll go up, 60, 70 percent.” \nThings are bound to change, but it could be a very long time before the WWE crowd finally embraces him. \nHow long do you think it will take before the majority of WWE fans love Roman Reigns?
