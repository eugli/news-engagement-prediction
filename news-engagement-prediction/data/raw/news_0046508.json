The woman who is seen attacking him glances back furtively as she walks quickly away from the scene. \nHowever, those at the check-in area all seem oblivious to the attack.\nThe woman looks like Doan Thi Huong, the woman pictured wearing the blouse with “LOL”.\nJong-nam looks to be stunned by the attack and is seen walking swiftly to an information counter and speaking to two personnel there, a man and a woman. \nThe woman takes him to another part of the building where two policemen in uniform listen to his complaints. \nHis is seen gesturing with both hands to his face and seems to be telling the policemen about the attack. \n\nSeeking first aid: Jong-nam being escorted to the KLIA2 clinic. Although he kept pointing to his face, he looks unharmed.\nThe two policemen then walk with him to the airport clinic. \nJong-nam could walk normally and did not need any help. The clip ends as he walks into the clinic.\nHours later, came the report that he was dead.\nWatch the video at https://t.co/supZfGIXeL?ssr=true", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:10:44.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
