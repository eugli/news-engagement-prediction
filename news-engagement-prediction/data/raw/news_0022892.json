Arrest warrants previously obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution allege that Quinn was caught on camera while having sex with a prostitute .\nThe prosecutor was arrested Jan. 17 and charged with pandering and violation of Georgia’s felony racketeering statute. He was released two days after his arrest — and went back to work with the district attorney’s office.\nQuinn, who previously played roles in arguing appellate court and pre-trial death penalty motions, performed “limited duties” after his arrest, Porter has said. That involved helping prepare briefs and other documents for fellow prosecutors.\nPorter defended that arrangement, saying he was waiting to make a final decision until he got more information from Dunwoody police and that he didn’t believe in suspension with pay.\nQuinn had worked with the Gwinnett District Attorney’s Office for “three or four years,” Porter said, and had a lengthy career with the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office before that.\nPorter said he believes Quinn has “a plan for future employment” but that it’s not with Gwinnett County.\nMessages left with Quinn’s attorney, Noah Pines, were not immediately returned Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:44:26.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
