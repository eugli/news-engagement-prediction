Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nTwo Merseyside Ukip officials have resigned over leader Paul Nuttall’s “crass” and “insensitive” comments about the Hillsborough disaster - including the chair of his own branch in Liverpool. \nIn a joint statement, Liverpool Chairman Stuart Monkcom and Merseyside spokesman Adam Heatherington said the Ukip leader’s approach had been “upsetting and intolerable”. \nThe Ukip leader was found to have published the false claim to have lost “close friends” in the tragedy on his website, which he blamed on a press officer. \nAnd he failed to condemn Arron Banks, a major Ukip donor who said he was “sick of hearing” about Hillsborough, accused people of “milking it” and called it an “accident”.

They had not provided a statement at the time of publication.
