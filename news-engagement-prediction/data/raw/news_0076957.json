His station has received four different calls for service in recent months.\n\"From our end, it's kind of funny that it happens but we have been in contact with the Morden police service in England and we've told them what's going on,\" he said.\nThe British Morden is in Merton , part of greater metropolitan London, and the force responsible for the community is called the Merton Police.\n'Our new friends' Police in the United Kingdom found it amusing, too.\nOfficers with Merton Police took to their Facebook page Tuesday letting people in the greater London district know to double-check before they dial.\n\"Calls are being forwarded to us by our new friends in Canada!\" the post read. \"When you are calling us and trying to get hold of our teams covering Morden , please check the number you are dialling as it could be very expensive!\"\nMenzies admits he had never heard of Morden , England before the calls came in and it doesn't appear as if the Manitoba city of 8,700 people was on the British detachment's radar either.\n\"It's been interesting to chat to our new sister force over the sea and [we] would like to point out that we are also very jealous of their trucks!\" police in England wrote.\nMerton Police told CBC News Wednesday they plan to send police in Manitoba a traditional police beat helmet and challenge them a moustache-growing contest to fundraise for Movember.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:04:44.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
