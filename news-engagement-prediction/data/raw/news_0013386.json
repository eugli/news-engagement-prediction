After an initial exam, they were asked to return one year and then two years later. At the initial visit, Ghana participants had the lowest average weights (139 pounds for both men and women), and Americans the highest weights (202 pounds for women, 206 pounds for men). The Ghanaians also were fitter than Americans with 76 percent of Ghanaian men and 44 percent of Ghanaian women meeting the US Surgeon General physical activity guidelines. Only 44 percent of American men and 20 percent of American women met the guidelines. The guidelines recommend completing at least two and a half hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (such as brisk walking) per week. But surprisingly for the researchers, total weight gain in every country was greater among participants who met the physical activity guidelines. Exercise well for your heart but eat well for your weight Dr Lara Dugas In one example, the American men who met the guidelines gained a half pound per year, while American men who did not meet the guideline lost 0.6 pounds. Lead author Dr Lara Dugas, an assistant professor at the Department of Public Health Sciences of Loyola University, said: 'The media is telling us that that more physical activity is needed to manage weight. 'But we saw that what actually predicted weight gain was your baseline starting weight - whether you were already overweight or obese when started or you needed to gain more weight.' Dr Dugas added that it was in fact diet that played a larger factor in weight management. She said: 'The problem is the intake side of the equation. There's not enough emphasis on what our portion sizes are and what we're eating than what is the sexiest, or latest fad diet.' The researchers had found that the American participants ate almost 1,000 calories more than the Ghanian participants. 'Obesity is a multifactorial disease. The epidemic didn't happen overnight by driving instead of walking,' Dr Dugas said. 'Physical activity is very important. It is the number one predictor of mortality and morbidity. 'But we're trying to change the mindset that exercise is what slims you down. What we would say is exercise well for your heart, but eat well for your weight.'
