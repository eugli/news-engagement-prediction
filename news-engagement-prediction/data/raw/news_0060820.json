The other, released by Google earlier this week , relates to an Windows graphics library flaw, disclosed to Microsoft more than six months ago, according to the vulnerability report . \nThe patches land a week after the company's usually-timed Patch Tuesday, which the company delayed for the first time in its history. \nBut it's not know exactly what the root cause of the delay was. \nZDNet's Mary Jo Foley said sources familiar with the company's goings-on said problems with Microsoft's build system could be the cause of the delay. \nA spokesperson for Microsoft would not comment further on the issue.
