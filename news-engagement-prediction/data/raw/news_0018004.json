(Yui Mok / Pool via AP) The Associated Press Published Sunday, February 5, 2017 11:31AM EST \nLONDON -- Queen Elizabeth II is poised for another historic milestone, an unprecedented 65 years on the throne. \nBut Buckingham Palace says Britain's longest-serving monarch plans to spend Monday's ceremonies far from the spotlight in sombre contemplation of her late father. \nOfficial commemorations of Elizabeth's Sapphire Jubilee are expected to feature ceremonial cannon fusillades at a central London park and at the riverside Tower of London as well as a procession of military horses pulling World War I-era artillery pieces. \nBut the 90-year-old monarch is staying 110 miles (175 kilometres) to the north at her Sandringham House estate in Norfolk, where her father, George VI, died of lung cancer at age 56 on Feb. 6, 1952, after a 15-year reign. \nElizabeth surpassed Queen Victoria as Britain's longest-serving monarch in 2015.
