To cut costs, health officials in Gauteng province (South Africa’s economic hub, which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria) decided to transfer psychiatric patients from specialised private hospitals to care homes run by charities. Family members, psychologists and advocacy groups all warned that this could be dangerous for the patients. They pleaded with Qedani Mahlangu, the provincial health minister, and even went to court to try to stop the move, arguing that vulnerable people were being rushed into dodgy homes that would not provide proper care. Ignoring their concerns, Ms Mahlangu went ahead. Some 1,300 patients were moved over several months last year. An ombudsman’s report described this process as a “cattle auction market”, with care homes jostling over which patients they wanted. Some sent pickup trucks to fetch them. Disabled patients were tied down with bed sheets for transport. Families did not know where their loved ones had gone. Soon, patients were dying. The full extent of the horror is still being uncovered. Last week South Africa’s health ombudsman, Malegapuru Makgoba, told a parliamentary committee that more than 100 patients had died in the debacle. More bodies are still unclaimed. His report into the scandal, released earlier this month, describes a spectrum of “negligent and reckless” conduct, including by government officials and the care homes, none of which was properly licensed. Some of the homes are described as “concentration camps”: patients were skinny and starving. Freddie Collitz, 61, who suffered from depression, died with a head wound, blisters on his ankles and a sore on his nose. Carers told his family he had fallen on the lawn. His death was listed as due to “natural causes”. Many of the other patients died of pneumonia, diarrhoea and dehydration. Neighbours of the Precious Angels home, where 20 people died, reported hearing screams. Bodies were stacked in a rundown morgue. South Africans are shocked that such a tragedy could have happened despite all the warnings. “[Ms Mahlangu] and her administration knew of the risks before embarking on this project and watched as the tragedy unfolded,” said Section 27, a civil society group. “They did nothing to stop it.” Another group, Treatment Action Campaign, compared it to the Marikana massacre, when 34 striking mineworkers were shot dead by police. The deaths of more than 100 vulnerable people, in the most appalling of conditions, further dents the moral authority of the African National Congress (ANC) that has governed since the end of apartheid. The scandal may also damage the party at the polls: the ANC received a narrow 54% of the vote in Gauteng province in 2014 elections (compared with 62% nationally). Both Johannesburg and Pretoria slipped from the party’s control in last year’s local polls. Ms Mahlangu has resigned—an almost unheard-of case of a South African government official voluntarily stepping down as a result of scandal. Opposition parties want to press criminal charges against her and two other officials. Jack Bloom, shadow health minister for the opposition Democratic Alliance, notes that Ms Mahlangu only admitted that patients had died after he quizzed her about it in the Gauteng legislature. Her disclosure that 36 had perished led to the investigation. But even then, the ombudsman’s report said, she didn’t grasp the full extent of the disaster: the death toll at the time was actually 77. “The horror is that this could have been covered up,” Mr Bloom says.
