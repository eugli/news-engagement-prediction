Helen Bailey and her fiance Ian Stewart Credit: REX/Shutterstock \nS tewart was convicted of murder, preventing lawful burial, perverting the course of justice and also fraud in relation to money he transferred from Ms Bailey's bank account to his own after she went missing. \nDiane, who had suffered from epilepsy since childhood, was found dead in the garden of their large country home in Bassingbourn in June 2010. \nAn inquest held three months later concluded that the school secretary had suffered \"sudden unexpected death from epilepsy\". \nBut relatives have expressed \"huge concerns\" over the circumstances and have backed the fresh police probe. Diane Stewart died unexpectedly in 2010. Police are now re-examining the case \nO ne family member, who requested anonymity, said: \"We were told at the time it was an unexplained death and it has worried me, it has been on my mind that it was unexplained.\" \n“He [Stewart] was the only one there when she died… I know her brother and sister have been very concerned. Her mother has been very concerned too, it has been awful for her.” \nDetective Chief Inspector Jerome Kent from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit, said: \"Diane Stewart died in 2010. There was a coroner's investigation and a post-mortem done and it was concluded that she had died of natural causes. But you would expect me to have a look back over the case to see what happened.\" \nHowever the fact that she was cremated may mean the truth can never be fully established. Diane Stewart, who died in 2010, with her sons, Jamie and Oliver and husband Ian \nM s Bailey disappeared from the sprawling £1.5 million home in Royston, Hertfordshire that she shared with Stewart, on April 11 last year. \nHe did not report her missing for five days and then told police she had left a note appealing for some space. \nFor the next three months he played the part of the concerned partner, while her family were left desperate for any news of her whereabouts. \nBut all the time her body and that of her beloved pet Dachshund, Boris, lay in a tank of effluent beneath the property. \nStewart was arrested on suspicion of murder three months after Ms Bailey disappeared, but refused to accept his guilt, concocting a ludicrous story that his fiance had been kidnapped by two former associates of her late husband.

When he reported her missing we had no reason to think he was not telling the truth. \n\"I cannot say when he started to target Helen but I do wonder if the seeds were being sown in the very early days of their relationship. It seems to have been quite a quick process from meeting to selling her house and them moving in with one another. \n\"He is a very persuasive person. He charmed her, he wooed her and he wormed his way into her life quite early on.\" \nHe added: \"What he did with her body shows what he thought of her. You would not put a loved one in a cesspit. I do not believe he ever wanted to go through with that marriage. He never bought the engagement ring even though she had chosen the stone and the setting. \n\"To hide the body in the well knowing every time you went to the loo, where that was going. He had no love for that woman whatsoever and held her in utter contempt.\" Helen's body was discovered in a brick cesspit hidden under the garage Credit: PA \nS tewart now faces life in prison when he is sentenced meaning his two sons, Jamie and Oliver, who gave evidence for the prosecution, have been deprived of both parents, following the death of their mother in 2010. \nReacting to the news of the guilty verdict, Helen's brother John, acknowledged that when he said: \"Our thoughts are very much with Ian's family.\" \nHe added: \"Although this is a victory for justice there can be no celebration. Our families have been devastated and nothing can ever bring Helen back to us or truly right this wrong. \n\"A long shadow of loss has been cast over the lives of so many who will always remember Helen with love and affection.\" Follow Telegraph News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:25:27.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
