'Two-year delays' \nIn January Jeremy Hunt said he did not expect the UK to remain within the EMA but was \"hopeful\" of being able to continue working closely with the regulator. \n\"Separate regulatory arrangements\" would be put in place, he added. \nDavid Jeffreys, the vice-president of Eisai - a Japanese drugs firm that employs 450 people in the UK - said British patients could face delays of up to two years. \nHe said: \"The early innovative medicines will be applied for in the USA, in Japan and through the European system and the UK will be in the second or indeed the third wave so UK patients may be getting medicines, 12, 18, 24 months later than they would if we remained in the European system.\" \nMr Jeffreys, who also speaks for the trade body the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said they wanted the UK to agree a co-operation deal with the EMA, even if it did not remain part of the EU system. \nThe former chief executive of the MHRA, Sir Kent Woods, said he believed an agreement could be reached between the UK and the EU for drug regulation in the future, but was concerned about the issue getting absorbed in a wider debate about trade terms. \nMoving the EMA from London could put its work overseeing the safety of medicines imported from outside the EU at risk, he added. 'Faster access' \nThe Department of Health said ensuring patients have timely access to safe and effective medicines remains a priority for the government. \nA spokeswoman added: \"In fact, Brexit brings opportunities in this area, and we will be focused on whether we can secure even faster access to the latest innovations for British patients. \n\"So we are already taking action to ensure the UK continues to be a world leader and our cross-agency Brexit taskforce is considering the future regulatory roles the MHRA could adopt.\" \nThe EMA is subject to rulings by the European Court of Justice, and Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK must be outside the court's jurisdiction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T08:10:07.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
