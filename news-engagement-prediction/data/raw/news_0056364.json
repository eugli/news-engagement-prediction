A post shared by Leah Remini (@leahremini) on Feb 20, 2017 at 6:46pm PST \nMax and Emme officially turn 9 years old on Wednesday. Lopez said in an interview with People and Entertainment Weekly in March 2016 that her children inspired her 2011 hit single “On the Floor.” \n“I had given birth and the kids honestly just gave me a new direction,” the star shared through tears. \n“They just made me realise, like, what was real and what wasn’t real,” she added. “They just changed everything.” A post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) on Feb 17, 2017 at 3:17am PST \nLopez and Anthony split in 2011 after seven years of marriage, but have remained close friends since. The “I Luh Ya Papi” singer was last linked to rapper Drake, but confirmed she’s single on Monday’s episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show .
