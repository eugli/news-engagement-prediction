We know it is not easy and India is number one at the moment. It will be difficult for us but that is why we play cricket - face the challenge and do well,\" the allrounder told reporters on the sidelines of a two-day warm-up game against India A.\nThe Test match will be held at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket stadium here from February 9.\nThe team needs to put up a collective effort to the best of its ability to do well against India, he said.\nObserving that the Indian team is a formidable one at the moment with its spin attack, fast bowlers and batting department raising the bar, Shakib reiterated that his team needs to be at its best to make it tough for the host.\nHe appreciated India captain Virat Kohli and others for their performances in recent times.\nHe said his experience of playing in the IPL would come in handy.\nHe said the young players, including the bowlers, in his side have been doing a good job.\nMeanwhile, India A bowler Aniket Choudhary , who claimed four wickets today at the Gymkhana grounds, said it is a good feeling.\n\"It's a big thing for me that I came to India A and doing well and took four wickets. It is a good feeling for me,\" he said.\n\"The wicket suited my bowling,\" he added.\nChoudhary missed a hat-trick in the 61st over of the day.\n\"The ball was changed. The ball (we were bowling) became old and soft. Then, we spoke to the umpire, spoke to the skipper that we should change the ball. The umpire said okay. I missed five wickets as there was a good chance but it's okay. Next time, I will definitely take,\" he said.\nChoudhary added, \"It's very important for me to play for country. I have been doing well in Ranji trophy. I got this chance also.\"\nHe said he was expecting a India A call last year also.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T20:31:06.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
