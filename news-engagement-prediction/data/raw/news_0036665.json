The Flint Believes: That there’re equally interesting things happening in tech in Africa beyond e-commerce. Beyond mPesa. There is more to technology in Africa than internet startups. That Africa has a lot of new knowledge to teach the world about how and why technology gets made, distributed, and used. That we as African makers can be doing so much more to deepen our understanding of our tools and our craft. Nobody is coming to save us. We need to learn to do hard(er) things. That there has never been a better time to be a curious, motivated African who is trying to build the future. Why This? Why Now? Something is happening in the world. You might not be able to articulate it, but you can almost certainly feel it. The rules are upended, and if we Africans are quick-witted and focused, we can expose the lie in old narratives, and craft lives of quiet dignity for ourselves and those we love. It starts with you and I going back to basics to better understand our technology tools, and creating strong communities of shared learning and practice. Nobody is coming to save us. We need to learn to do hard things. The Flint is inspired by First Round Review .
