It's one of the reasons we love her so much — and her latest Twitter takedown is no different. \nAfter Chrissy told Entertainment Tonight at this weekend's Producers Guild Awards that a baby boy would be next for her and hubby John Legend, she had to clarify that this did NOT mean she was pregnant. She took to Twitter to explain to her fans that the reason they know the gender of their future baby is because of IVF. \n\"Since this is coming up again, I said our next baby would be a boy because that is the embryo we have left,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"A boy. So. Yeah.\" ADVERTISEMENT Since this is coming up again, I said our next baby would be a boy because that is the embryo we have left. A boy. So. Yeah. \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) January 30, 2017 And no, I am not pregnant. \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) January 30, 2017 \nBut she definitely did not stop there. Chrissy's interaction with internet trolls never ceases to amaze us as she does it in a way that's so confident and RT-worthy. Plus, a filter never seems to be an option. Following her pregnancy rumor tweets, someone decided to question Chrissy's baby-making skills, and she shut them down instantly. Her response to this woman's ridiculous question will make any couple who's conceived through IVF beam with pride. \nThe woman wrote, \"Did you give it a minute to try naturally or are you avoiding 'the act?' At least no political rants!\" Chrissy responded, \"Hi Linda, thanks for asking, you complete witch. I tried for about nine years. Anything else, let me know!\" @chrissyteigen did you give it a minute to try naturally or are you avoiding \"the act?\" At least no political rants! \n— Linda Wampler (@lindawampler) January 30, 2017 Hi Linda, thanks for asking, you complete witch. I tried for about 9 years. Anything else, let me know! https://t.co/54e9AvIqQ9 \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) January 30, 2017 \nChrissy and John have been very open about their struggles to conceive naturally as well as their trials with IVF, but her response to this woman's question is just a reminder that their family's plans are no one's business but theirs.
