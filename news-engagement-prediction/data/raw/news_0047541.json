And, at last year’s edition of the event, he spelt out his elaborate vision for rebooting India. \n\nThe prime minister is expected to deliver a powerful message of inspiration this year as well. More so because India is an island of stable prosperity in an increasingly uncertain global environment. It is also a rare example of a major economy where policymakers are taking big, bold decisions to speed up growth. This year FDI is likely to be at record levels. \n\nThis year the PM’s message will be all the more eagerly anticipated. Since the last GBS, Parliament has passed key legislation, notably the GST and the Bankruptcy Bill. In November, the PM unveiled the biggest reform of all, demonetisation, a move intended both to crack down on the black economy as well as to boost digital modes of payment. Other initiatives such as improving the ease of doing business and ‘Make in India’ appear to be gaining traction with companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google as well as manufacturing companies announcing major investments. \n\nAs with the past two years, the audience will consist of a large contingent of delegates from across the globe, the who’s who of the Indian political elite and captains of industry. \n\nAlso attending will be a glittering supporting cast of global thought leaders and CEOs. \n\nAt the last GBS, the prime minister said his government’s goal was “reform to transform”. At the upcoming event, he’s expected to reinforce his commitment to change for a better tomorrow.
