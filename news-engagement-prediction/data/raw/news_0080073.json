Now he will relive the trauma at the sound of the word ‘maths’. He was once open to be taught, but now no longer is.”\n\nOther social media users condemned the crowd for laughing during the incident. - South China Morning Post/Asia News Network", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:07:18.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
