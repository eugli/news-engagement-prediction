In case you do not believe me, I would like to submit the picture above to the court as Exhibit A.\nThis gentleman has his Super Bowl Sunday best on, with an all-white suit with a red stripe down the side airbrushed with a giant Falcons helmet (with red flames coming off of it) on the back and is wearing a red hat with Falcons logos on the side. We can’t forget about those shoes either. The white with black on top is extra clean and shiny for the Super Bowl.\nI can’t stop looking at this suit. It’s incredible.\nThis man went to the mall and bought a custom white suit with red striping and then said “this is not enough” and went to the air brush station to get a Falcons helmet and “Rise Up” on the back.\n\nAtlanta is just so beautiful. The Falcons have the church crowd on their side and swag surfing fans in Houston. \n\nOh about yesterday when you ask if we are in Houston ? #atlvseverybody pic.twitter.com/BeagOdMF5I \n— Ryan Cameron (@ryancameron) February 5, 2017 \n\n\nThat’s unbridled joy and excitement from the Falcons faithful. Comparatively, the Patriots have Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump on their side. I don’t see how this all doesn’t add up to an Atlanta blowout victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:07:01.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
