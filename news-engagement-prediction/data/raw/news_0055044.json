The Canadian Press Published Wednesday, February 22, 2017 5:51AM EST \nCHUMPHON, Thailand - Police in Thailand have arrested two men accused of slashing a Canadian man with a machete while trying to steal a gold necklace from his female companion last week. \nThe Bangkok Post reported in its online edition that Canadian Philip Sullivan, 68, and King Kulkaew of Bangkok had left a restaurant on foot last Wednesday in the southern city of Chumphon when they were followed by a pickup truck. \nThen, at a quiet spot near the restaurant, police say one suspect allegedly left the vehicle and tried to snatch King's gold necklace. \nPolice say Sullivan intervened and was hacked on the right arm and neck and is now in stable condition. His companion suffered bruising. \nChumphon police chief, Maj.-Gen. Sonthichai Arwattanakul says the suspects fled without the necklace and were later identified through security camera footage. \nThe newspaper says the two suspects, Yutthana Chumworathaayee, 36, and Sarawut Katerat, 35, were released from prison only three months ago after being convicted of attempted murder and assault. \nThere was no immediate information on Sullivan's hometown.
