This year‚Äôs line favored more monochromatic looks, with West opting to include new colorways, including burgundy and a dark shade of blue, while retaining a few of his favorite concepts from past releases like camo, black and denim. \nThe collection also features high-end and athletic pieces such as long-extensive fur coats, embroidered jackets, track jackets, sheer jackets, extended crew neck sweaters, hoodies, sweat pants, thigh-high boots, running sneakers, and bags. \nBut not everyone was thrilled with his line. \nEnigmatic pop singer-songwriter Sia apparently saw the models sauntering down the runway in mink jackets and fur-trimmed vests and took it upon herself to politely ask West to consider going ‚Äúfur free‚Äù in the future. ‚ÄúDear @kanyewest would you consider going fur free?,‚Äù she wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúThis is the reality of fur fashion ‚Äî it‚Äôs so sad.‚Äù She then linked to a graphic video that exposes the conditions of animals used for fur.
