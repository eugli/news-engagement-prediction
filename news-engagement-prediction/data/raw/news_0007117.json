He talked about public schools, worried about public schools and delivered to schools the state’s share of Gonski needs based funding, which most benefits public schools. He took on federal education minister, Simon Birmingham, about abandoning public schools . Piccoli, a member of the National Party, was popular across all sectors of schooling. \nBy replacing him with Rob Stokes, a Liberal whose expertise is in environmental planning, Berejiklian has shown none of this mattered. The talk is now all about factions, deals and pay backs, when it should be about what is best for children in government schools.\nNSW reshuffle: Gladys Berejiklian axes Adrian Piccoli and Duncan Gay from cabinet Read more \nMost conservative leaders seem to easily forget the majority of Australians send their children to public schools . Many families choose their local public school these days, even though low fee, faith-based private schools abound. The latest Bureau of Statistics figures show that 65.4% of Australians send their children to public schools (up from 65.1% in 2014, but down from 79% in 1977).\nMost Australians want their politicians to be interested in public schools, to worry about public schools, and help create the best public schools possible.\nOf course the conservatives can do worse than have no vision. I once asked Christopher Pyne, when he was education minister, what he wanted to do with public schools. Did he want to close them all down? His answer was not the usual non sequitur. No, he didn’t want to close down public schools; he just wanted them to be more like private schools.\nIt was the lowest expectation I could think of for Australia’s public schooling. To be more like private schools? It felt small minded, unknowledgeable, and bordering on nasty.\nOf course Pyne went ahead and tried to do exactly that with his idea to expand the Independent Public Schools scheme. Happily, like most of Christopher Pyne’s ideas on education, it failed to take off. Adrian Piccoli came to the fore then too. He accepted the extra money on behalf of all NSW public schools to be used, not make some public schools “independent”, but to build on public school relationships with their communities. \nThis goes to the heart of why having a vision for public schools matters. Building relationships and connections with local communities is one of the most powerful things public schools do. They do this from within the strength and support of public school systems where celebrating difference is a core value.\nIt is almost impossible for some private schools to achieve this deep connection to local communities because of their commuter cohort of students. Also there is sameness to the middle class view or, for a few, upper class view of the world of manicured gardens and perfect children.\nIt is vital for our social fabric to have strong, quality public schools that reflect their local communities. That should be a part of any Australian education minister’s vision for public schools.\nSimon Birmingham’s vision for public schools is just as pathetic. He officially delivered us the end to Gonski school funding reforms with the excuse the arrangements weren’t “pure” enough (yes Julia Gillard did stuff it up by promising no school would lose money). It seems all Birmingham wants from public schools now is “more bang for the buck”, an idea which is outlined in the vague policy document Quality Schools, Quality Outcomes. \nThere is nothing wrong with that expectation. Of course we want bang for our buck, and the government’s idea of setting up a national evidence base to gather evidence to inform educational policy is a great one. We should only be spending money on things that evidence shows will work, surely.\nHowever, unlike medical research, producing some kind of “gold standard” in educational research is problematic. We would need to invest a great deal more in independent educational research than we do now. Also deciding what research would be used as a policy base could be 100% politicised. As University of Newcastle’s James Ladwig writes in National Evidence Base for educational policy: a good idea or half-baked plan? “there is NO systemic development of research informed policy analysis which is independent from government itself in Australia.”\nCommonwealth v states: Gonski schoolyard fight is just getting started | Gabrielle Chan Read more \nAnd I can’t resist pointing out; there is not much educational bang in any buck that goes towards the millions of dollars gobbled up by building a “world class” gym or a wellness centre . Indeed, Birmingham has noted that some private schools are over-funded . But I expect he will never act on it because private school lobbies in Australia have far too much political power.\nThe Coalition is repeatedly showing us it is wilfully ignorant about the importance of public schools and public school values . Significantly, I don’t remember any federal conservative education minister ever acknowledging the growing divide between public and private schools in Australia and what it might mean for our future, certainly not that it is a problem.\nDespite the Coalition’s “ emotional commitment ” to private schools, and the fact that the majority of funding for government schools comes from state and territory governments, I don’t believe I am expecting too much.\nI want the leaders of various governments, state and territories and federal, to have an articulated, strong vision for the schools that educate the majority of Australian children.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:24:51.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
