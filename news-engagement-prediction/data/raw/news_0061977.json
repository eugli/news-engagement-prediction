Hulcy, Young Women's STEAM Academy at Balch Springs and Lincoln High all had elevated copper levels. STEAM Middle School at D.A. Hulcy also had lead levels that were five times higher than what the Environmental Protection Agency recommends for remediation. \nThat makes a dozen DISD campuses with recent reports that showed elevated metal levels in water. District officials are now planning for continued testing, despite initially saying it would be unnecessary to do so. \n\"We're discussing how to structure future monitoring for quality of the district's water going forward,\" said Christopher Gray, DISD's director of environmental health and safety. He said the change in approach came after ongoing media reports and community concern. \nWhile district officials have stressed that DISD's water is safe to drink and worked on educating parents of steps taken, Gray said there was pressure to do more. \nQuality concerns have arisen nationally in the wake of the water crisis in Flint, Mich., where residents were exposed to dangerous levels of lead. Schools across the country have since found aging systems and infrastructure issues that are contributing to elevated levels. \nDallas began testing this fall, after Fort Worth ISD found widespread problems in dozens of its schools. Other districts across the state also started testing. Seven Dallas ISD schools have elevated lead or copper in water \nOn Jan. 20, Dallas ISD officials said elevated levels were found at Woodrow Wilson High, Preston Hollow Elementary, Billy Earl Dade Middle, Madison High, Skyline High and Wilmer-Hutchins elementary and high schools. \nGray said results from a second phase of testing showed the high levels at the five additional schools. Those reports to the district are dated Jan. 5 to Jan. 13. \nGray said problems at 11 of the schools have since been addressed. That could include new equipment, new filters for water fountains or retrofitting. Some water sources did not require any changes after subsequent testing found lower levels, Gray said. \nCurrently, only Wilmer-Hutchins Elementary is still in the process of having equipment replaced. \nDistrict spokeswoman Robyn Harris said principals were asked to notify their campuses of the elevated levels in late January, shortly after DISD officials learned of the results. \nThe EPA says there is no safe level for lead and generally requires action if levels are at least 15 parts per billion in water. \nBut schools don't typically fall under such EPA requirements. The agency does recommend schools take action if levels are at least 20 parts per billion. EPA recommends action for copper if levels are higher than 1.3 parts per million. \nProlonged exposure to lead can have serious health effects, especially in the brain development of young children. Too much copper can cause vomiting, diarrhea, nausea and stomach cramps, and has been associated with liver damage and kidney disease.
