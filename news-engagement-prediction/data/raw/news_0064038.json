Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone in 'La La Land' ACTOR IN A LEADING ROLE Casey Affleck in \"Manchester by the Sea\" Andrew Garfield in \"Hacksaw Ridge\" Ryan Gosling in \"La La Land\" Viggo Mortensen in \"Captain Fantastic\" Denzel Washington in \"Fences\" This ranks as one of the few major categories that's genuinely suspenseful. Affleck seemed like a sure thing early on, but c ontroversy surrounding past sexual-harassment allegations and Washington's showy performance in \"Fences\" -- which he also directed -- have pushed him up into serious contention. Neither would be a surprise, but the latter seems like the more likely and sentimental choice. ACTOR IN A SUPPORTING ROLE Jeff Bridges in \"Hell or High Water\" Mahershala Ali in \"Moonlight\" Lucas Hedges in \"Manchester by the Sea\" Dev Patel in \"Lion\" Michael Shannon in \"Nocturnal Animals\" Picking one actor from \"Moonlight\" is actually no mean feat, but Ali has dominated early awards and had a standout year, with his supporting role in \"Hidden Figures\" as well. Plus, he's charmed voters at other awards with his acceptance speeches, which doesn't hurt.
