Yemi Ogunbiyi \nDoes he still know the terrain of the University he once lectured in, almost forty (40) years ago? With his friends in virtually all the “factions”, what will Dr. Ogunbiyi do and say, that will make the “warriors” sheathe their swords? These and many more are the questions begging for answers from this new Governing Council. \nNot surprisingly, Dr. Ogunbiyi, whose administrative prowess has never been in doubt, hit the ground running during the inaugural meeting of the new council; less than three weeks after the announcement of its members by the Federal Government. \nThe courtesy call on the Ooni of Ife by this council prepared stakeholders for great expectation. As a Chief of Ife (Omolokun Adimula of Ife), Dr. Ogunbiyi assured Kabiyesi that the town (Ife) and gown (OAU) would now have more beneficial relationship which would be midwifed by the Council. \nApplauding the new council, the Ooni of Ife eulogised the sparkling qualifies of all the council members and showered them with royal blessings for a smooth running of the governance of Obafemi Awolowo University. Having been impressed by the calibre of people in the council, Kabiyesi urged them to use their individual wealth of experience and collectively pooled them to further uplift Obafemi Awolowo University to a greater height. \nIn less than 24 hours, the new council had toured all facilities, on and off campus, with a determined pledge to refurbish or upgrade those that needed repairs and, if possible, procure new ones. The tour to the halls of residence was most interesting, particularly that of the Awolowo Hall, reputed to be the socio-political headquarters of Great Ife, when Dr. Ogunbiyi engaged the students in a mini town hall meeting with questions and answers. \nImpressed by his candour and conduct, and coming to their level by visiting their toilets, bathrooms and rooms, the Awoites (as residents call themselves) started surging; ‘Baba ti ba wa se’ (our father has done it for us), T’alo so p’a o ni Baba (who says we don’t have a father”) etc, in appreciation of what the council promised to do for them. \nBy this time, the atmosphere on campus has become frenzied as all the staff unions have been waiting for the man of the moment who had scheduled a meeting of reconciliation with them. \nOne after the other, and in a no-hold barred, frank talk, issues raised were soundly tackled, puzzles were clinically solved, questions were brilliantly answered, grey arrears were intelligently addressed, wounds were healed and realistic solutions proffered to some perceived knotty issues. It was at this point that the seed of reconstruction of faith in our collective destiny was planted and the incubation of reconciliation was made manifest. \nHaving restored peace to Obafemi Awolowo University, the next agendum for this council is ensuring a smooth academic calendar and appointment of a substantive Vice-Chancellor for this 55 years old citadel of intellectualism. \nStakeholders are of the firm belief that the combination of business acumen, academic attainment, administrative prowess, native intelligence and cultural orientation of Yemi Ogunbiyi and his council members would restore the University to its former glorious position as the best in Nigeria and Africans Most Beautiful Campus, West of Sahara, North of Limpopo.
