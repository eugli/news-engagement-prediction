You wanna kill me? I’m here, kill me man,” he screams at the driver. \nThe driver, who doesn’t raise his voice during the heated exchange, attempts to calm the situation down to no avail. \n“My f**king mate got killed in the city by a f**king car driver like you, he f**king hit his head, man,” the cyclist shouts. \n“Every f**king day car drivers come too close, one day someone’s gonna f**king kill me. If you want to kill me, I’m f**king here, bro.” The cyclist claims the car was within touching distance and coming around a blind corner. Source: Supplied \nThe driver once again tries to bring calm to the escalating situation. \n“You’ve got to realise that I drive safe around bike riders, I slow right down. You’ve got too much adrenaline running,’ he tells the cyclist. \nAfter a brief moment of awkward silence, the driver’s frustrations appear to come to the surface. \n“Settle down, because one day someone is going to f**king clock you,” he said. \nObviously filled with adrenaline, the cyclist begins shaping up to the driver. \n“I’m f**king ready, someone wants to f**king kill me, man. I’m ready to die, bro,” he said. \nThe driver then asks Mr Johnstone if he is looking to go to jail. \n“I’ve already been to jail, bro. I ain’t afraid of going back,” Mr Johnstone responds. \nThe motorist then pulls back onto the road and drives away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:14:38.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
