Social media shares from people stuck on the road Coquihalla closed in both directions from Hope to Merritt, people trapped in cars \"The major problem was the huge numbers of trucks, and it was like a huge sheet of ice coming down the hill to the Coldwater Interchange and then back up again, \" Webber told All Points West host Robyn Burns.\nWebber says they were stuck on the highway overnight from 9 p.m. to 9:30 a.m.\n\"Nobody came through the night to tell us what was going on,\" Webber said.\n\"Hunkering down was an option, because my husband had lived in Prince George, so he was well prepared.\n\"He had packed all the sleeping bags in the car just in case. We had a full bag of really unhealthy snacks, so the kids were happy.\"\nMalcom Smith gets credit from his wife for packing down sleeping bags that kept them warm overnight on the Coquihalla Highway.
