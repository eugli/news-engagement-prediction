On average police are using force against an animal every two days of the year.

But there's always a possibility that maybe some officers don't care too much about an animal because it's seen as a danger to others or to itself,\" Kriek said. \n\"We always urge for police to take the most humane action possible in the situation,\" he said. \nDogs took the full brunt from officers with more than 1290 subject to force being used against them. And Kriek said it was justifiable to shoot at aggressive dogs who charge or put a stop to rampaging animals putting people's lives in danger. But even in those incidents, the decision to kill is not always clear cut. Auckland woman Uma Chand is angry her family dog Budz was killed by an officer in her backyard last year. Budz was a guard dog but was also considered a family member. He charged at a police officer who entered the back of the property during a search. LAWRENCE SMITH / FAIRFAX NZ \nUma Chand and her family are devastated after police conducted a search warrant on their South Auckland house and shot their family dog when it became aggressive. \nThe officer fired twice at Budz which killed him instantly. \nChand said the dog was doing its job and police did not give the family a chance to call him off, without the need to shoot. \n\"What hurts me the most is that my dog never had a chance against a bullet. In a split second he was taken... that officer's actions cost me a lot,\" Chand said. \nThe figures also show police shot at, sprayed or hit 214 cattle, 64 sheep, 27 deer and 31 horses. \nRecords of whether these animals were killed, wounded or simply hit were not provided by police. \nNor would police confirm which of the incidents happened on public property or in private property. However, legal justification for police action against an animal was listed under either the Crimes Act, the Dog Control Act, the Animal Welfare Act and the Land Transport Act. The most common reason for using force was recorded under section 48 of the Crimes Act which is defence against assault, self-defence or defense of another. In December last year, a goat was tasered by an officer on a property in Oamaru after it was reported disrupting traffic on State Highway One. \"Unfortunately it was pretty stressed out and quite unco-operative, so I tasered it,\" Oamaru Senior Constable Carl Pedersen said at the time. \nTwo ducks, a chicken and a possum were all sick or inured animals that were shot under section 138 of the Animal Welfare Act. The same went for the five cats who were put down by officers after they had apparently been hit by vehicles. The most unusual animal shot at was a great white shark. \nIn February 2013, Kumeu-based policeman Constable Rob Bailey shot at the shark after it attacked and killed swimmer Adam Strange at Muriwai Beach. \nThe shark was not scared away by police circling it in a boat and would not release Strange's body from its jaws until it was shot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:26:26.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
