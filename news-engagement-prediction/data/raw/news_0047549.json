But outside those exemptions, Kelly wrote that DHS “no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.” \nA DHS official said the agencies are “going back to our traditional roots” on enforcement. \nThe memos cover a sprawling set of initiatives including: Prioritizing criminal illegal immigrants and others for deportation, updating guidance from previous administration Expanding the 287(g) program, which allows participating local officers to act as immigration agents – and had been rolled back under the Obama administration Starting the planning, design and construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall Hiring 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers Hiring 5,000 Border Patrol agents Ending “catch-and-release” policies under which illegal immigrants subject to deportation potentially are allowed to “abscond” and fail to appear at removal hearings \nIt’s unclear what timelines the secretary is setting for some of these objectives, and what budgetary and other constraints the department and its myriad agencies will face. In pursuing an end to “catch-and-release,” one memo called for a plan with the Justice Department to “surge” immigration judges and asylum officers to handle additional cases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:19:41.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
