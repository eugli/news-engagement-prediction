Jersey City was No. 1 in 2015 and slipped to No. 2 in 2016, although it was still considered the most diverse mid-size city last year. \n\"Our diversity is one of our greatest strengths as a city and something for which we are exceptionally proud,\" Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop said. \"Jersey City has always been a welcoming home for new groups seeking a better life, bringing a diversity of cultures, religions, and languages here, which is truly the embodiment of the promise of America.\" \nThe study ranked 500 cities by using three key metrics -- ethno-racial diversity, linguistic diversity and birthplace diversity. The three categories are weighted -- with ethnoracial diversity making up 50 percent of the score. \nJersey City, with a population of 264,000, ranked No. 2 in ethno-racial diversity, No. 1 in linguistics and No. 151 in birthplace diversity. Oakland, California is No.1 in ethno-racial diversity, according to the study. \nA government study in 2015 showed that at least 40 different languages are spoken in the homes of Jersey City students. According to the U.S. Census, Jersey City's population is 32.7 percent white, 25.8 percent black and 23.7 percent Asian.
