But it’s usually difficult to translate his tweets. \nWell, the always cryptic Smith was at it once again on Tuesday. Don't act surprised… that's all I'm going to say! \n— Geno (@GenoSmith7) February 21, 2017 \nWhile it’s impossible to know what Smith is referring to in this tweet, it doesn’t take too active an imagination to wonder if he’s alluding to his future with the Jets. \nSmith will be a free agent for the first time in his career and while many think he’s better off finding a new home, he might be the Jets’ best option at quarterback of the available free agents this spring. \nWhether it was injuries or bad luck, Smith has never gotten a fair shot to start at QB under the Jets regime of Todd Bowles and Mike Maccagnan. They could still be curious about Smith’s tantalizing skill set. Related: POLL: Which CB will Jets sign in free agency? \nSmith would also be a cheap, short-term option while Christian Hackenberg develops. \nSmith, 26, should draw interest from several teams in the market for a backup QB, but injury concerns will likely leave him with a one-year offer. He is still recovering from a torn ACL suffered in October and may miss a significant portion of the offseason conditioning program for whatever team he ends up with. \nThe Jets are also expected to have a degree of interest in Bucs QB Mike Glennon, but his price tag will be significantly higher than Smith’s. Right now, Hackenberg and Bryce Petty are the only two signal-callers on the roster.
