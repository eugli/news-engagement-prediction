Lack of preferences \nThe way early years care is funded means that those who need help the most do not receive it, while many affluent families are generously subsidised, the report found. \nIt also highlighted what it described as \"inequitable cross-subsidisation\", where parents are required to pay high fees for a few extra hours, because the government funding rates are so low that the richer parents, seeking more hours, are effectively topping up the government's contribution. \nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook \nCurrently, parents of three and four-year-olds in England are entitled to 15 hours free childcare a week, but this is due to increase to 30 hours from September. \nAnd providers say that nursery costs for parents could \"sky-rocket\" in some areas as providers grapple with less funding for the scheme. \nThe report also argues that attempts to improve the quality of childcare have ended up increasing the amount of regulation, while failing to produce better outcomes. \nHowever, previous attempts by the government to change the ratio of children to carers were met with resistance from childcare providers, who said the changes would not lead to savings. \nThe report said the system has also limited choice for parents as alternative forms of care such as home-based childminders are priced out of the sector. Affordable? \nLen Shackleton, co-author of the report, said: \"Government interventions in the childcare sector have resulted in both British families and taxpayers bearing a heavy burden of expensive provision. \n\"Regulation has led to an excessive formalisation of childcare and pre-school, which has not only pushed up costs but paid scant attention to parental preferences. \n\"Many families may not want the structured form of pre-school that the government requires as standard. \n\"At a time when many families are facing a cost of living crisis, it is important the government rethinks its involvement in childcare. Rowing back on unnecessary regulation and focusing public funds on those who need it, rather than subsidising the well-off, would be a good way to start.\" \nA Department for Education spokesman said helping families with high quality, affordable childcare was at the heart of the government's agenda. \n\"That's why we are investing a record £6bn per year by 2020,\" he said. \n\"Our 30 hours free offer for three and four-year-olds is set to save working parents up to £5,000 per year and we're also supporting the most disadvantaged families through our free 15 hours offer for two-year-olds and our pupil premium - worth over £300 a year per eligible child. \n\"We make no apologies for regulations which keep children safe and well.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T13:45:20.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
