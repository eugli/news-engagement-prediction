He can’t wait until next year. By next year, the all-star outfielder and former National League batting champion could be long gone from Colorado. \nDespite making his desire for a contract extension well known, Gonzalez told me there have been no serious negotiations on a long-term deal that would ensure he stays with the Rockies beyond this season. The decision is in the hands of general manager Jeff Bridich , and there has not been an offer put on the table for Gonzalez to consider. \n“The team needs to approach us if they want it to happen. I’ve got one year left on my contract, and there’s no conversation right now,” Gonzalez said Wednesday. \n“It’s up to them. They’re the ones that make the decision. We don’t make the decision. We just listen and work.” \nAt a time when a long-suffering franchise believes it’s on the verge of becoming a perennial playoff contender, could it be the Rockies are ready to win without the potent bat and sterling glove of CarGo? \nLast autumn, during the final days of a 75-87 season, Gonzalez cited an upgrade of young talent on the roster as a solid reason to skip the chance to become a free agent later this year and commit to a contract extension that could allow him to end his career in Colorado and become as much a fixture in Rockies’ lore as Todd Helton. After expressing his wishes to Bridich, however, the conversation has never advanced to the real nitty gritty of dollars and cents. \n“I felt like (Bridich) was trying to make sure where we were, in terms of whether I wanted to be here or not. But after that, there’s been zero talks,” Gonzalez said. \nIf disappointed with the lack of urgency from the Rockies to get a deal done, CarGo does not let it dim his smile, and he vowed not to let his uncertain future be a distraction for a team intent on challenging Los Angeles and San Francisco for supremacy in the National League West. \n“My only option is to play baseball and do it the right way,” said Gonzalez, who hit .298 and drove in 100 runs last season, while making his third all-star appearance for the Rockies. \n“I just concentrate on the things you have to do. If you have to clean the house, clean the house and don’t worry about who’s going to pay you. If you worry about who’s going to pay you and don’t clean the house, nobody’s going to pay you.” \nAfter signing Ian Desmond to a five-year, $70 million contract in the offseason, the Rockies caused head-scratching among baseball analysts by declaring their newly acquired 31-year-old veteran would fill a hole in the Colorado infield by learning how to play first base. But it also seems increasingly clear Desmond was brought in with roster flexibility in mind, and his stint at first base could be short-lived, should Bridich balk at the price agent Scott Boras seeks for Gonzalez and a spot re-opens for Desmond in the outfield.
