Sydney needs more schools \nOver the next ten years demand for schools across Sydney is almost going to double. \nBut hitting that target would require a significant statistical reversal: 29 schools have closed across the Independent, Catholic and government sectors since 2010, according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. \nPublic schools have made up the largest share of closures with more than 20 shutting their gates since 2010, according to the ABS data, as the state's school aged population gets set to surge. SHARE Former NSW Education Minister Adrian Piccoli with his replacement Rob Stokes Photo: Anthony Stipo \n\"The data is very clear, the NSW population is growing by 28 per cent over the next 20 years,\" said Mr Stokes. \n\"The point is we have a huge demographic challenge and we have to increase our capacity to accommodate those children.\" Advertisement \nFairfax Media revealed last year an $11 billion budget shortfall raised the prospect of shortage of classrooms for thousands over the next decade. \nTotal spending on education as a proportion of the state budget now makes up 5 per cent less than in 2003. \nSecuring the support of the independent and Catholic sector to build more schools would relieve some of that burden. \nBut a spokesman for the Catholic Education Commission of NSW said most of the sector's enrolment growth will be met by expanding existing schools. \n\"However it is feasible to forecast 2-3 new Catholic schools per year across the state,\" he said. \nDr Geoff Newcombe, Chief Executive of the NSW Association of Independent Schools, said he had discussed with the government ways of meeting the expected growth in student numbers . \nHe said the government's changes to the State Environmental Planning Policy, which removes regulatory burdens, would play an important role by increasing their capacity to enrol additional students. \n\"These proposed changes are strongly supported by the sector,\" he said. ​ \nAppearing with Mr Stokes, Mr Piccoli denied his removal from the portfolio was down to a factional power-play. \n\"No not at all,\" he said. \"[Mr Stokes'] heart is in the right place, which is what you need to be an effective education minister.\" \nA 15-year-old student at Griffith High School was more blunt. \"Aren't you the guy who lost his job,\" she asked Mr Piccoli after the pair were photographed arm in arm. \nMr Stokes, who is currently completing a Masters in Planning at Oxford, admitted his knowledge was light on curriculum despite former roles as a classroom and university teacher. \n\"I do not claim in any way whatsoever to be an expert in matters of education,\" he said. \"One of the things about education is being a listener and a learner myself. \n\"That is part of the reason why I am down here with Adrian, he wanted to show me first-hand teacher education and support,\" Mr Stokes said. \nThe Pittwater MP who was educated at a public primary school and later at one of Sydney's most expensive private schools, SHORE, said he would continue to lobby Federal Education Minister Simon Birmingham for the full six years of Gonski funding. \n\"My focus remains on the unresolved issues of funding the balance of the Gonski agreement reached [with the federal government],\" he said. \n﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:20:14.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
