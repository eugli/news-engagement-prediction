Among the 64 participants are former world champions Alexandra Kosteniuk , Anna Ushenina , Antoaneta Stefanova and Zhu Chen . The top seed is world number two Ju Wenjun . \nWe're a day away from an important tournament that's been controversial from the moment it was announced. This year's world championship for women will be held in Iran. Hence, the participants will be forced to wear hijabs. \nBecause of this, not all players who qualified will travel to Iran. For example, Argentina's number one player Carolina Lujan decided to skip the event and wrote on Facebook : \n\"The mandatory use of hijab do not seem to me that this is a simple dress code, it means a lot and for my beliefs, beliefs and values. I'm not ready to be forced to use it. Also, due to the misinformation that is on their culture, a possible confusion could send us to jail or worse.\" I will be the official photographer in the Women's World Championship.

Paikidze referred to the FIDE Handbook , which states that the organization “rejects discriminatory treatment for national, political, racial, social or religious reasons or on account of sex.” \nPaikidze's protest was covered worldwide in mainstream media , but that didn't change anything. The tournament will be held according to plan, with the opening ceremony on Friday and the first round on Saturday. \nAnd many strong players will be playing! The top seeds (listing all 2500+ players) are Ju Wenjun (CHN, 2583), Anna Muzychuk (UKR, 2558), Alexandra Kosteniuk , (RUS, 2549), Harika Dronavalli (IND, 2539), Nana Dzagnidze , (GEO, 2525), Valentina Gunina , (RUS, 2524), Antoaneta Stefanova , (BUL, 2512), Zhao Xue (CHN, 2505), and Tan Zhongyi (CHN, 2502).

The reigning world champion has decided to quit the world championship cycle for women, because she's not happy with the regulations for women, and especially the fact that there are different regulations than for her male colleagues. — Reza ( @Rez7a ) February 10, 2017 Valentina Gunina in between her mother and Anna Muzychuk, at the opening ceremony. \nThe world championship is a knockout tournament consisting of five rounds. During the first four rounds, which will last three days each, the players play two games and then if needed a tiebreak.
