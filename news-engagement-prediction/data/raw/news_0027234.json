The category was one of three country races announced during the marathon pre-telecast Grammy Premiere ceremony.

The Kentucky singer-songwriter will have another chance at the national stage: A Sailor's Guide to Earth is nominated in the all-genre Album of the Year category, to be announced later tonight on CBS. \nIn two other country races, vocal group Pentatonix pulled off an upset win for their take on \"Jolene\" featuring Dolly Parton, and Lori McKenna's \"Humble & Kind,\" a Number One country-radio hit for Tim McGraw, won Best Country Song. \n\"I sat at my dining room table and wrote a song for my kids one day,\" said McKenna through tears. \"Tim McGraw made a moment out of this simple prayer for my kids, and I thank Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. They're a reason I have a job â€¦ Thanks for letting little songs like this make their way onto the radio.\" \nElsewhere, Lady Antebellum's Hillary Scott and the Scott Family prevailed in both categories in which they were nominated: Best Contemporary Christian Music Album for Love Remains , and Contemporary Christian Music Performance for \"Thy Will.\" \nDuo Joey + Rory's Hymns was named Best Roots Gospel Album. The victory was bittersweet for Rory Feek: his wife and musical partner Joey Martin Feek died from cancer at age 40 on March 4th. Accepting the award in his trademark overalls, Rory Feek dedicated the trophy to Joey. \n\"My wife's dream was to make a hymns album, and she didn't have a chance to do it until she was diagnosed with stage four cancer. She'd sing her vocals in hotel rooms while she did chemo and radiation,\" said Feek, who promised his wife he'd attend the Grammys should they be nominated. \"She told me, 'Remember, if we win, I'll know before you will.\" \nVince Gill also dedicated his Best American Roots Song victory to a fallen musical partner. \"Kid Sister\" was written about Dawn Sears, his bandmate in the Western swing band the Time Jumpers, who died from cancer in December 2014. \n\"I wish you all would have had the chance once in your life to hear the voice of the woman I wrote this song about,\" said Gill. \nOther Americana winners included Sarah Jarosz, for Best American Roots Performance for \"House of Mercy\" and for Best Folk Album for Undercurrent . Soul singer William Bell won Best Americana Album for This Is Where I Live , his first album in 10 years. \nWillie Nelson's tribute to the Gershwin brothers, Summertime: Willie Nelson Sings Gershwin , won Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. \nHere are the winners so far in the country and Americana categories: \nBest Country Solo Performance \"Love Can Go to Hell,\" Brandy Clark\"Vice,\" Miranda Lambert", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:12:09.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
