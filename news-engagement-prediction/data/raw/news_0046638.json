His distraught family has now raised the reward for information on his whereabouts to RM100,000. \nThe reward has increased ten-fold just two days after an initial offering of RM10,000, in a desperate plea to secure the safe release of Koh, who was abducted from his car in broad daylight last Monday. \n“Our family is grateful and touched that concerned well-wishers have stepped up to increase the reward money,” said Koh’s wife, Susanna Liew, 61. \n“We hope this will help in efforts to find my husband and see his safe and sound return to us,” she added. \nThe pastor’s son, Jonathan, said anyone who could provide any kind of information on his father’s abduction would be eligible for the reward. \n“A panel will decide how the full reward will be divided according to the accuracy and usefulness of information provided. The identity of informers will be kept private if they so request,” he said in a statement yesterday. \nThe family is pleading with the public for help as police investigations have not come up with any significant leads as to the identity of Koh’s abductors or their accomplices. \nInvestigators had so far failed to trace the three heavily-tinted SUVs used in the abduction or the location of the Honda Accord driven by Koh when he was kidnapped. \nThose with any credible information or leads on the investigation can contact Jonathan at 011-3973 2670. \nLiew said while the family was gratified by the outflow of prayers and good wishes from concerned people, they hope the public will respect the need to keep Jonathan’s phone number free for investigation purposes only. \nKoh was abducted last Monday by a group of masked men on Jalan SS4B/10, Petaling Jaya, less than 100m from the police housing complex. \nHe was driving a silver Honda Accord bearing the licence plate number ST 5515 D. \nHis abduction was confirmed by Selangor CID chief Senior Asst Comm Fadzil Ahmat the day after the alleged crime. \nPolice said they were still investigating Koh’s disappearance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:47:38.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
