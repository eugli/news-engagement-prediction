The fire came within 200m of houses and 50m of a neighbour's gate. BRADEN FASTIER / FAIRFAX NZ \nPaul and Cheryl Kiesanowski with their cat Lily who they were forced to leave behind as they fled their home. \nREAD MORE: * Christchurch family devastated their home is ash \nThe cordons across the affected Port Hills area are understood to be being reviewed today, with some residents being allowed through when safe. \nThis follow's last night's debacle, which saw some residents turning up to cordons expecting to be allowed through, after a Facebook message incorrectly said they were partially open. MORNING REPORT/RNZ \nFire investigators are heading back up the Port Hills in Chch this morning, determined to find the cause of the fires which have ravaged the area this week. \nThe Kiesanowskis were evacuated about 4pm on Wednesday, by which stage they could already feel the heat of the flames ripping towards them. \nLily was nowhere to be seen so they had to evacuate without her. \nThey were relieved to this morning find her back home - traumatised and hungry but otherwise OK. \nThe pair say the firefighters - whose monsoon buckets are still swinging overhead as they refill from Halswell Quarry Park - deserve medals. Ad Feedback \n\"It must have been a really rough night for them on Wednesday,\" Paul says. \nThe couple is staying with their daughter in Bishopdale and, with the capsule wardrobe in the back and Lily safely recaptured, they're content to sit it out until police lift the cordon permanently.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:28:34.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
