BBC Andrew Marr \nThe by-election, which was prompted by the resignation of Labour MP Tristram Hunt to take up a new job as director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, offers UKIP its best chance to get its leader elected to Westminster. \nLabour held the seat with a 5,000 majority two years ago and has suffered from rows about its candidate Gareth Snell, who once tweeted disparaging remarks about women and about Brexit itself. \nNuttall was forced to withdraw from a planned appearance on the Marr Show on February 5 after he declared his candidacy for the Stoke seat. Strict rules for broadcasters prevent disproportionate airtime for individual by-election candidates. \nHe is understood to have committed to coming on the show the weekend after the contest was over, win or lose.
