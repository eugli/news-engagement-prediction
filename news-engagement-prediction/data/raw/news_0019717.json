Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voter fraud. (Pool/Getty Images) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Friday, February 10, 2017, 6:35 PM \nWASHINGTON— President Trump has revived groundless claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. \nA GOP official with knowledge of Thursday’s lunch conversation described the President’s comments. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. \nThere is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. \nAyotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, to shepherd him around Capitol Hill for meetings. \nThe discussion at Thursday’s lunch partly involved Gorsuch’s nomination as Trump looks for eight Democratic votes to get him over a procedural hurdle in the Senate. \nIn the course of the conversation Trump had a lighthearted exchange with Ayotte, who withdrew her support from Trump during last year’s campaign after audio emerged of him boasting about groping women. Trump said he wished Ayotte had endorsed him like she’d endorsed Gorsuch and also made the comments about voting in New Hampshire. Trump's assertion that voters were bused into New Hampshire in order to vote, losing Ayotte her election is baseless. (Elise Amendola/AP) \n“There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of major voter fraud in New Hampshire’s elections,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said in a statement. “President Trump continues to spread a dangerous lie and it’s long past time for Republican leadership in New Hampshire to stand up and defend our state’s electoral system.” \nTrump’s comments were first reported by Politico. \nIt’s the second time Trump has used a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers to make erroneous claims about voter fraud. \nLast month, during a bipartisan congressional leadership meeting at the White House, he claimed that he would have won the popular vote if not for 3 million to 5 million immigrants in the country illegally voting for his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. There is also no evidence of that. \nTrump recently vowed to set up a White House commission helmed by Vice President Mike Pence to pursue his claims of election fraud.
