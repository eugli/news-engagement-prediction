It means going back to a sense of unity and community in which we nurture and care for each other rather than tear apart and divide each other.\" \nIn this case, MAGA is being flipped on its head. \nThe same goes for artist Emma Tolkin 's Black Lives Matter red hat, designed to look just like the MAGA hat too. Tolkin's friend Bridget Todd in her Black Lives Matter hat Source: Emma Tolkin \nAccording to Tolkin, she made the hats for her and her friend Bridget Todd after joking about it online. Then Todd posted a picture of herself in the hat on Twitter — and it went viral . \nAs a result, Tolkin set up her own site and in the past two weeks, she's sold more than 100 hats. \nThe real mission here, according to Tolkin, is to do something that'd make Donald Trump and his supporters mad, and also give back, with at least $10 from each hat going to organizations like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the National Network of Abortion Funds. \n\"Trump is just like this oozing faberge egg of a human beingand being able to just fuck with him and maybe make him angry is so easy and so important,\" Tolkin said in an interview. \"We're taking his slogan and turning it into a rallying cry for our own passions, like human rights.\" Emma Tolkin at the women's march in Los Angeles Source: Emma Tolkin \nAs far as why the hat has been such a brilliant canvas for this sort of action, Tolkin blames its simplicity. \"It's so easy,\" Tolkin said. \"It's a screaming neon canvas with foghorns playing. It's somehow both very distinctly and easily recognizable so it can be lampooned and fucked with without losing the original reference at all.\" \nThere's also the element of surprise here. People from far away might think people like Tolkin and Todd are Trump supporters, then find out the exact opposite. That's what makes it fun. \nAnd for Todd on inauguration weekend in Washington, that was certainly the case. \n\"Many Trump supporters were very excited to see a black woman wearing what they thought was a Make America Great again hat around the inauguration festivities,\" Todd said. \"When they realized the hat actually said Black Lives Matter their tune changed pretty quickly. I really enjoy subverting the expectations of these people and making them them about how their support for Trump might play for a black woman like myself.\" \nAlthough all of these hats are different, there is a common thread: The rights and issues brought up with most of these hats happen to be the rights and issues people feel are in peril right now with Trump in the White House. \nThe Human Rights Campaign, for instance, has its own Make America Gay Again and Make America LGBTQ Again hats, with profits going back to the HRC to fight for LGBTQ equality.
