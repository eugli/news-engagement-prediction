The legislation would require physicians to deliver a fetus at six months or later by inducing a woman into labor or performing a cesarean section.\nOnce the fetus is removed, doctors would be required to attempt to use whatever means to resuscitate the baby. Doctors who violate the law could be charged with a felony.\nRelated stories...
