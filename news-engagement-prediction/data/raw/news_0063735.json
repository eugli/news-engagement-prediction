Luckily, she was dumped outside a house with CCTV so we’re now able to release the footage of her being abandoned in the hope of finding the person responsible for such cruelty.\n“Unfortunately, we receive thousands of calls every year about pets - particularly dogs - who have been coldly and callously dumped by their owners. To abandon any pet is shocking, but to do so in the depths of winter when they are in such poor condition is just heartless.”\n– Inspector Justin Stubbs East Midlands Peterborough", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:06:47.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
