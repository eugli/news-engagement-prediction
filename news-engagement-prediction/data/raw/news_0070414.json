Figuring out what’s causing the pain is key to making it disappear. Read on for 12 common triggers and doctor-recommended remedies… Headaches often hit out of nowhere – when you’re shopping, taking a walk or waking after a peaceful nap. But they’re not as random as they seem. A slew of bodily and external factors can trigger them. “The brain is the central organ of the body, so every organ feeds back to it,” says Alan Rapoport, MD, clinical professor of neurology at UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine. “It will respond to any dysfunction or abnormality in the neck, face, head or skull as pain.” Women are more susceptible to migraines and tension headaches, because of fluctuating estrogen levels, Dr. Rapoport says. In fact, women are three times more likely than men to get migraines. But that doesn’t mean you’re stuck with the pain. Find out what sets off various headaches so you can get rid of them: 1. Your Period Estrogen levels drop just before menstruation, increasing proteins that promote inflammation and making you more susceptible to pain, says B. Lee Peterlin, DO, director of headache research at Johns Hopkins Headache Center in Baltimore. In fact, a 2015 study, published in The Journal of Headache and Pain , found that 60% of women with migraines found a link between when they menstruated and when they experienced a migraine. Headache Rx: A common remedy is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are analgesics. Over-the-counter products include naproxen and ibuprofen. A prescription NSAID, diclofenac potassium, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for migraines in 2010. It’s dissolved in water and swallowed. Another prescription migraine treatment, triptans, reduce symptoms or abort attacks by narrowing the brain’s blood vessels. They’re available in tablets, injections or nasal sprays. 2. Weather Dramatic temperature or weather changes are linked to the onset of headaches, according to a 2015 large-scale study published in the International Journal of Biometerology . “Weather may affect the nerves that go to the head or central nervous system [the brain and spinal cord],” Dr. Rapoport says. Headache Rx: Obviously, you can’t control weather – unless you move to a milder climate. Your best bet is to take migraine medicine as soon as you sense weather conditions that set off headaches. 3. Changing sleep habits Sleeping in on the weekend and staying up into the wee hours? Too little or excessive rest may explain your throbbing head. Altering regular rest patterns “disrupts the balance in part of the brain, which ultimately triggers pain,” Dr. Peterlin says. Headache Rx: Stick to a set sleep schedule – go to bed and wake up at the same time, even on vacations and weekends. 4. Sinus infections Have a dull ache or painful pressure in your cheeks or over your eyebrows? It’s probably an infection that’s causing swelling and fluid buildup in the sinus cavities. You may also have green mucus and fever. Headache Rx: First, see your doctor to make sure it’s a sinus infection. About 60%-70% of Dr. Rapoport’s patients don’t have sinusitis at all, he says. “They have migraines.” If it’s a sinus-triggered headache, reduce pain by placing warm compresses over your sinuses for the first three days. If the infection is bacterial, you’ll need a doctor-prescribed antibiotic. 5. High blood pressure Hypertension with long-term readings of 170 systolic and 120 diastolic (170/120) are another headache trigger. You may have blurred vision and dizziness too. Scientists have no clear cause for hypertension-related headaches, but blood vessels may enlarge and bleed, increasing pressure in the brain, Dr. Rapoport speculates. Headache Rx : You’ll have to get blood pressure under control, and your doctor most likely will prescribe beta blockers, calcium blockers or angiotensin receptor blockers. 6. Medications Not only does high blood pressure cause headaches, but so can the medication you take for it, by dilating blood vessels. Many other medications produce similar reactions, including those for asthma and colds (particularly antihistamines and decongestants), stimulants such as diet pills and hormone therapies.Ironically, even some migraine medications – such as triptans – and drugstore remedies like Aleve and Motrin can cause rebound headaches if they’re taken more than 10 days a month, says Stephen D. Silberstein, MD, professor of neurology and director of the Jefferson Headache Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. “The rebound happens because the use of analgesics turns off the brain’s pain-control system, and that limits the body’s ability to combat pain,” Dr. Silberstein says. Headache Rx: To determine if medications are the trigger, keep a journal, noting when you take each medication and the time the headache hits. You’ll need to consult a doctor before making changes in medications and dosages. Ask about switching to other drugs without the same side effects or taking them less frequently, Dr. Rapoport says. 7. Stress How does stress trigger headaches? The hypothalamus, the part of the brain that responds to disruptions, turns on the organ’s pain-detecting neurons. A 2014 study , published in the journal Cephalalgia , found a strong link between headache frequency and stress intensity. Headache Rx: Stress is unavoidable, but you can control your reaction to it. “Try not to take on more than you can handle,” Dr. Peterlin says. Therapy is a proven stress-reliever. Two techniques that may help: Cognitive behavioral therapy can reduce anxiety by helping you change negative thought patterns. Biofeedback treatment uses relaxation methods such as deep breathing and meditation to reduce your physical response to stress. 8. Ice cream There’s a physiological reason for that excruciating pain you get after biting into an ice cream cone. The frigid temperature activates nerves in the roof of your mouth, which react by clamping down on blood flow. “The blood vessel constriction causes something similar to a mini-migraine,” says Neil Martin, MD, chairman of the department of neurosurgery at UCLA’s Geffen School of Medicine. Headache Rx: You don’t have to skip the icy delight, though that helps – just eat it slowly. 9. Excessive alcohol Some people are sensitive to ingredients in alcohol, such as tyramine in red wine. Additionally, dehydration – which often accompanies drinking – may exacerbate headaches. Dr. Peterlin suspects that dehydration – like too little sleep or food – disrupts the body’s balance, activating a part of the brain that triggers headaches. Headache Rx: When you drink, note which types of alcohol set off headaches so you know which to skip. Also, before and after imbibing, down both water and sports drinks with minerals and salts (which become depleted when you’re dehydrated). 10. Too-tight hair bands or hats Hair bands may look great, but they’re not healthy for your head. If they’re too tight, they cut off blood flow to the muscles, leading to headaches, Dr. Rapoport says. Headache Rx: Find a new fashion statement, he says. 11. Smoking There are many health reasons to quit smoking, but here’s one more: Decreased oxygen in the blood is another headache trigger. “That would be for a four-pack-a-day smoker after 30 years, not for the average smoker,” Dr. Rapoport says. Headache Rx: Quit. “You shouldn’t smoke even one cigarette,” he says. 12. Hunger Skipping a meal can trigger headaches, especially migraines. Doctors suspect that when we’re hungry, muscle tension and low blood sugar may set off processes that lead to pain. Headache Rx: “Boring regularity,” Dr. Peterlin says. “Eat at the same times every day.” Health writer Dorothy Foltz-Gray is a frequent contributor to Lifescript.
