We also need to see, for example, companies supporting workers in their rights to join and organise unions.’ The 45-year-old wife of former prime minister David Cameron included classic dresses, blouses and pencil skirts in her range, which went on sale yesterday at Selfridges in London and online at Net-a-Porter. In Macedonia, some workers are allegedly paid as little as 64p an hour and faced grim and sometimes dangerous conditions. It is unknown how much Cefinn factory workers are paid A black T-shirt, described as a ‘satin panel boxy top’, is priced at £110 online, while a ‘belted cocoon coat’ is £390. But women larger than a size 14 were disappointed to find they could not buy anything. One wrote on Twitter: ‘Love the look of #SamCam #Cefinn fashion on sale ... but why no BIG sizes!’ The Cefinn spokesman said the label ‘definitely’ wanted to offer more sizes in future. ‘We definitely want to increase our size offer as we grow but as a new brand we need to be confident of our fit before grading or pattern cutting more than 2 sizes away from our size 10 fit pattern,’ she added. Mrs Cameron, who is an ambassador for the British Fashion Council, said she was ‘terrified’ of the public reaction to the range in an interview with the Sunday Times Style Magazine. But it would appear she has nothing to fear as a number of items are already listed online as ‘out of stock’ in some sizes. These include the navy cropped top with a neat pointed collar, sleeves and a sporty zip which is £150 and the navy midi dress with a fluted skirt. Cefinn said sales on day one had been ‘very encouraging’. The fashion range’s name is thought to derive from the first and last letters of ‘Cameron’, with the initials of the couple’s four children in the middle.
