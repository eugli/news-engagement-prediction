Online petitions were started and Hollywood talent spoke out about the decision before the story was easily debunked. However, the fear of blatant white-washing still lingers with audiences both domestically and abroad. It should be no surprise to hear that some fans are concerned Disney may dampen diverse casting when it comes to upcoming projects like Aladdin , but those worries should be done away with. According to the musical’s producer, the live-action iteration of Aladdin will be a wholly diverse affair. \nSpeaking with Collider , Dan Lin sat down to talk about his work on Aladdin. It was there that Lin reassured fans that he and director Guy Ritchie both have a diverse vision for the film along with Disney. \n“Look at me,” Lin said. “I mean I’m not a typical guy. Listen I’m very fortunate working in Hollywood; I am diverse. So when I came in to make the movie, I wanted to make a diverse version of the movie. Luckily for me Guy Ritchie has the same vision and Disney has the same vision, so we’re not here to make Prince of Persia. We want to make a movie that’s authentic to that world.” \nAs for the project itself, Lin hinted that the film would be more musical than its predecessors. ““We’re gonna be discovering new people because it’s a real challenge, because not only does an actor have to act, but they really have to have singing chops,” he explained. \nAladdin currently has no release date. Other live-action adaptations like The Little Mermaid, Mulan, and The Lion King are also in development. \nRight now, Disney is spending its time gearing up for its most pressing musical release with Beauty and the Beast . The iconic animated film will reenter theaters as a live-action project starring Emma Watson as Belle and Dan Stevens as the Beast. \nBeauty and the Beast will be released in U.S. theaters on March 17, 2017.
