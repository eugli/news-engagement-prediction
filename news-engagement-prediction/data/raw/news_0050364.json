It happened so quick,\" Mr Byrd said. \nIt was the fisho's first time on the river and he said he had no time to consider what could be lurking within. \n\"They do say there's some big lizards in there. \n\"Our main focus was trying to get that boat back but we realised there was no hope, she was full.\" 'How do I tell his mother?' \nMr Byrd was soon picked up by another boat of fishermen but was separated from his mates. \nHe said anxiety started to settle in when, by about 7:00pm, they had still not located his two friends and a thunderstorm hit the area, about three hours' drive from Darwin. \n\"We had about four or five boats full up and down the river all evening looking for my mates,\" he said. \n\"I was whistling non-stop. Yelling. It got to one point where I just sat in the boat with my head in my hands thinking: 'How do I tell his mother?' \n\"I was pretty much expecting the worst, and that's when another boat came up next to us and said, 'your mates are at the boat ramp'.\" \nThe duo who swam to safety were described by NT Police Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen as \"unbelievably lucky considering the huge amount of crocodiles that infest the area\". \n\"The two men had actually swum to the bank, walked along the bank of the South Alligator River, actually swam back across the river, walked through waist-deep swamps to get to the highway, which was about three kilometres away, and from there they got a lift back to the boat ramp,\" she said. \nAmateur Fishermen's Association of the NT president Warren De With said the incident was a relatively rare event, yet it was \"pretty well full of nightmares\". \n\"[This group was] very lucky. This sort of shows that crocodiles are a little more than opportunist hunters.\" Photo: Saltwater crocodiles are common in the rivers in Kakadu National Park. (Lisa Herbert: ABC Rural) \nHe said Top End fishermen should be aware of the possibility of bow waves of up to 100 metres long during the wet season when the rivers swell. \n\"You need to be aware of that wave coming, and it will pick up momentum as it pushes against the outgoing or running flood water as it comes down the river. \n\"You need to poke your nose straight into that so that you ride it over. If you hit side-on to it you will cop it on the side of the boat and it will maybe fold into the boat and it could sink you. \n\"Make sure you've got necessary safety equipment on board, and if you're in an area where water is running quickly, you might want to pop on your lifejacket.\" \nMr Byrd said the experience had not sunk in until Sunday morning when the trio woke up and wondered if it had all been a dream. \n\"I think we're just going to stick to fishing off the banks for a while.\" \nHe thanked the others on the river who helped them out and even retrieved their dinghy. \n\"It's good to see it's a good little community.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T06:12:16.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
