(9NEWS) Her parents are incredibly proud. (9NEWS) \nDr Luciano Dalla Pozza, Head of Oncology at The Children’s Hospital at Westmead, said he had never seen a case like Grace’s before. \n“Grace had a very rare form of cancer and there was no defined best therapy for her,” Dr Dalla Pozza said. \n“We weren’t sure what the best treatment was.” \nConsultations with overseas specialists were made to develop a tailored treatment plan for the toddler. \nAnd although the outcome of the treatment was very uncertain from the beginning, Grace beats the odds. Grace was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cancer. (9NEWS) \nRecently, a final CT scan showed the cancer, which affected her kidney and one of her lungs, was gone. \nGrace had her final procedure, to remove her central line, yesterday. \nToday a bell was rung at the hospital, marking the end of Grace’s treatment. She went through a 16-month treatment. (9NEWS) \n“It’s just the best day ever. It’s been a long time coming,” Ms Sharp said today. \n“She’s an amazing strong kid. All these cancer kids are.” \n“There’s no words that can describe how happy we are,” Grace’s father, Keiran Sharp said. \n“Words can’t comprehend how strong she’s been.” \n“We’re the proudest parents.” \nThe family was surrounded by friends, who had travelled from the central-west town to celebrate, as well as Parramatta Eels players. \n“She’s done really brilliantly,” Dr Dalla Pozza said. (9NEWS) \n“One shouldn’t underestimate how strong children are. It’s really quite remarkable.” \nGrace will need to come back to Sydney for check-ups but for the time being, she’s enjoying her life cancer-free. \n“She’s got a pony and a chook and that’s her life,” Ms Sharp said. \n“She’s a farm girl.” \nGrace’s parents commended the Bandaged Bear Appeal and the Little Wings Foundation for helping them through the battle. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T16:57:16.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
