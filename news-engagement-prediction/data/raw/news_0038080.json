No targeting was called, but the hit certainly was controversial. (Photo: Matt Cashore, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe sometimes controversial targeting rule in college football could get a welcome tweak for next season. When the NCAA Football Rules Committee meets next month, it will consider adding a “middle ground,” according to secretary-rules editor Rogers Redding, that would in some cases allow the offending player to remain in the game even if the penalty is not overturned. \nCurrently, a targeting call — defined by rule as “making forcible contact with the crown of the helmet,” or “making forcible contact to the head or neck area of a defenseless player ” — results in a 15-yard penalty and the ejection of the player who committed the foul. If the foul occurs in the second half of a game, the player is also suspended for the first half of the next game. \nEach call undergoes review; the replay official can confirm or reverse the call. Under the proposed change, a player would be given a reprieve if the replay official does not reverse the call but does not have enough evidence to confirm it. The 15-yard penalty would be enforced, but the player would not be ejected. \n“If the replay official has more time and more angles and says, ‘I can’t really confirm it’s targeting,’ the default position is the call on the field is correct, so it stands,” Redding said of the proposal. “But we’re not gonna throw him out. … The idea is that certainly the officials on the field saw something. We can’t say, ‘No, it’s not targeting,’ but there’s more middle ground.” \nRedding, whose term as secretary-rules editor expires in August (he’s also the national officiating coordinator), said even with the reprieve, the penalty would remain a deterrent to dangerous hits. \n“It’s not backing away from anything,” Redding said. “The kid is put on notice. He knows he did something to draw that flag. He was close to getting himself tossed out of the ballgame. That may give him pause about how he approaches making that same type of play.” \nBecause this is considered an off year in the rules cycle, only rules related to player safety can be considered. If the rules committee decided to change the targeting rule, it would forward a proposal to the Playing Rules Oversight Panel, which would make the final decision later this spring. \nThe targeting rule was first enacted in 2013 in hopes of reducing dangerous play, and has been tweaked several times. By rule, targeting requires forcible contact and other indicators: Did the penalized player launch into the collision? Did he lead with his helmet, shoulder, forearm, etc.? Was the other player defenseless? \nA year ago the rules committee expanded the ability of replay officials to review targeting, giving them the ability to attempt to determine whether there was intent. In addition to reversing calls, the new rule allowed replay officials to call targeting missed by officials on the field in what Redding termed “egregious” instances. \nMORE COLLEGE FOOTBALL NEWS Which new college football coaches step into toughest situations? \nThe number of targeting calls has risen in each season since the rule was implemented in 2013. In 2016, targeting was called 196 times and reversed 51 times — meaning 144 ejections when the penalty was upheld 144. All three numbers were the most ever; the 144 upheld calls doubled the 72 in 2014, two years earlier. \nTodd Berry, the executive director of the American Football Coaches Association, said while coaches supported the concept of targeting, they’d like to continue to evaluate its definition and how it is called. In particular, Berry pointed to instances when a receiver is descending after making a catch and a defensive player is unable to adjust to avoid making forcible contact in a way that, by the rule’s current definition, is illegal. \n“It’s almost impossible whenever there’s that much degree of change for them to be athletically capable of (avoiding it),” Berry said. “If the player launches, certainly that’s malicious and there’s no place in football for that. But for a young man to be ejected because his shoulder hit a facemask when the (receiver’s) plan was changing – I don’t think there’s any great answers, but we need to have great conversations.” \nBerry’s example isn’t likely to be addressed in a formal rule proposal this cycle. But Berry is in favor of the potential proposal to add Redding’s “middle ground” of the reprieve from ejection when there’s not enough evidence to confirm targeting in a replay review. \n“We’ve changed behavior,” Berry said. “That’s what we were trying to address from the beginning. To change behavior, there needed to be a stiff penalty, which obviously ejection is. … But there’s nothing wrong with trying to make something continually better. This is something that impacts the student-athlete and we need to be very serious about having these conversations.” \nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL PRESEASON TOP 25 FOR 2017 Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 1. Florida State: The Seminoles stumbled out of the gate this past season before hitting another gear following a loss to Clemson in October. With valuable experience under their belt and as much talent as any team in the country, Florida State is the team to beat in the Atlantic Coast Conference and very deserving of the title of preseason No. 1 in August. Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 2. Alabama: Personnel hits are coming, but that’s never derailed Alabama in the past. Quarterback Jalen Hurts will be even better, the offense should be more focused on the running game with a new coordinator and the defense will again rank among the nation’s best. Take note: Alabama and FSU meet in the opener. Brett Davis, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 3. Ohio State: Like the Crimson Tide, the Buckeyes will need to reload after losing several underclassmen to the NFL draft. But there will be far fewer losses this offseason than a year ago, so look for Ohio State to be loaded with talent and experience, not to mention more streamlined and less predictable on offense after some staffing changes. Rich Barnes, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 4. Michigan: The Wolverines will be right on the Buckeyes’ heels, as they were in 2016 — and as will be the case for as long as Jim Harbaugh and Urban Meyer are in charge. There is too much to like about Michigan to list here, but begin with the major assets: a wonderful defense despite a few losses in the back seven, a physical and punishing brand of offense, and a sense of unfinished business after two painful losses to end this year. Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 5. Washington: Reaching the Peach Bowl showed Washington’s growth, though the loss to Alabama revealed the distance still to travel before the Huskies can win a national championship. Considering Chris Petersen’s history, the 2017 team could be better than this year’s version, even if there will be a number of personnel issues to address as a result of early departures. The Huskies will be the preseason favorites in the Pac-12 and a strong contender for the Playoff. Jennifer Buchanan, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 6. Oklahoma: The Sooners obviously must improve on defense after a sluggish season, but there’s reason for optimism. Given the likely production of the Baker Mayfield-led offense, OU is simply a defense away from taking the Big 12 and returning to the Playoff. The Sooners have enormous expectations but slightly more question marks than the five teams listed above. Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 7. USC: Let the hype begin for USC and its superb quarterback Sam Darnold, who will begin his sophomore season at or near the top of every Heisman Trophy list. The question: Are the Trojans ready to take the next step? The ability and athleticism are there, but the potential departure of several NFL-ready underclassmen bears watching. Gary A. Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 8. Penn State: The Nittany Lions’ biggest post-regular season development was offensive coordinator Joe Moorhead’s decision to return in 2017. That, along with the return of quarterback Trace McSorley and running back Saquon Barkley, will ensure this offseason will be even better next season. Recapturing this year’s magic won’t be easy, but there’s zero reason to think Penn State is poised to take any step back. Marc Lebryk, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 9. Clemson: Clemson is among the most intriguing teams in college football entering next season. Deshaun Watson won’t be around, and that alone is reason to think the Tigers will begin the year pegged to finish behind Florida State. But this program recruits an elite level, has an outstanding defensive line, should get improved play on the offensive line and has earned the benefit of the doubt. Still, there will be major weapons to replace on offense and key leaders to replace on defense. This may nonetheless be too low a ranking for Clemson. Joshua S. Kelly, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 10. Oklahoma State: To call Oklahoma State a sleeper ignores the fact that this program has been in the national picture for the better part of the decade. But there seems to be something overlooked about the Cowboys, who return the heart of their offense and have enough coming back on defense to be right alongside or just behind Oklahoma on the Big 12 ladder. Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports 11. LSU: The Tigers’ impressive bowl win against Louisville provided some early validation for Ed Orgeron. How far LSU goes hinges almost entirely on how quickly new coordinator Matt Canada can turn around the offense. Jonathan Dyer, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 12. Wisconsin: Any doubts of Wisconsin’s ability to remain a national presence should be dismissed after another banner year for Paul Chryst and the Badgers. UW will be just behind the top three of Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State in the Big Ten. Thomas J. Russo, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 13. Virginia Tech: In what was supposed to be a building year, Justin Fuente led the Hokies to a divisional title and 10 wins. The future will be even better, beginning with a 2017 team that should repeat atop the ACC Coastal Division. Jim Dedmon, Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 14. Auburn: This is the most intriguing team in the SEC and perhaps in all of college football. Auburn is often hit or miss, but the addition of Baylor transfer Jarrett Stidham should kick the Tigers’ offense into a different gear. But will that be enough? Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 15. Stanford: Replacing Christian McCaffrey and finding better quarterback play are the Cardinal’s most pressing questions entering the offseason. This might not be a perfect team, but trust in David Shaw and his staff to pilot Stanford to another season spent in the thick of the Pac-12 and Rose Bowl hunt. Ivan Pierre Aguirre, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 16. Boise State: The top-ranked team from the Group of Five ranks will again be a favorite for double-digit wins during the regular season. Look for quarterback Brett Rypien to take another step forward and become a top-10 player at his position nationally. Matt Kartozian, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 17. Georgia: The SEC East Division will be a toss-up, with Georgia and two other teams soon to appear on this battling for a shot at the conference title. The Bulldogs seem the most likely to take another step forward thanks to quarterback Jacob Eason’s development and the arrival of an outstanding recruiting class. Justin Ford, USA TODAY Sports 18. Tennessee: But the Volunteers aren’t far behind. Much depends on finding a capable successor to quarterback Josh Dobbs and locating the sort of consistency needed to go from top-25 team to Playoff contender. Christopher Hanewinckel, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 19. Louisville: There’s always reining Heisman winner Lamar Jackson, but Louisville’s late swoon raises the issue of whether this team is about more than just a sublime quarterback and offense. While still very much a threat in the ACC, the Cardinals should be placed behind FSU and Clemson in the Atlantic Division. Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 20. South Florida: Adding a defense-first coach in Charlie Strong to an impressive offense will keep USF in the mix for 10-plus wins and a New Year’s Six bowl in 2017. There are several strong contenders in the American Athletic Conference, but the Bulls are the preseason favorite. Shanna Lockwood, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 21. Utah: Pegging the Utes for a national ranking seems like a safe bet. Whether Utah can do more – such as knock off USC and win the South Division – remains a question, however, particularly with losses at running back, wide receiver and the defensive line. Kelley L Cox, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 22. Florida: It all comes down to the offense, and whether the Gators’ attack can finally find some momentum under Jim McElwain and produce at the rate needed to compete for a Playoff berth. That’s still a concern entering McElwain’s third season in charge. Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 23. West Virginia: There will be a new quarterback and a different look on defense, especially in the secondary. The Mountaineers are still a threat for a top-three finish in the Big 12 after what may very well be a breakthrough season for Dana Holgorsen. Logan Bowles, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 24. Texas: Does Texas have the same potential as Tom Herman’s first team at Houston, which went 13-1 and won the Peach Bowl? Maybe, but probably not. This team won’t win the Big 12, but a change in culture and a huge uptick in production on offense should find the Longhorns at eight or nine wins in 2017. Brendan Maloney, USA TODAY Sports 25. UCLA: It almost never pays to have faith in Jim Mora and UCLA, but years of strong recruiting and a healthy Josh Rosen under center should yield a nice rebound after a horrific 2016 season. Mark J.
