The program is run by founder and executive director Robin Petgrave, an African-American pilot whose company conducts helicopter tours, charter flights and entertainment industry production work. Isaiah Cooper from Compton, Calif., aims to become the youngest pilot to fly solo around the world. Jim Seida / NBC News \nCooper said he flourished as a pilot until he entered middle school and got involved with the wrong crowd. He left the aeronautical program and his grades dropped. \n\"I eventually realized that wasn't how I wanted to live my life,\" Cooper said. \nAs a high school student, Cooper enrolled in independent study and returned to the TAM program. He recently started a fundraising campaign at gofundme.com to support his next goal: breaking the Guinness World Record for being the youngest person to fly around the world in 2018 at the age of 18. \n\"I used to think of flying as a hobby,\" said Cooper. \"But I've decided that after college, I want to follow in the footsteps of Robin and make a career as a private helicopter pilot.\" \nDEFINE YOURSELF IN THREE HASHTAGS #YoungAviator #BlackExcellence #TheFuture \nFAVORITE SONG TO PLAY AT FULL VOLUME \"The Sound\" by The 1975 \nMOST PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT I love chocolate, and I hate eggs \nFollow NBCBLK on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram Linda Childers ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:55:38.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
