I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let’s do it. All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down. \n“I went and got it at half time from the kitchen, I had it all prepared and ready to go. It was meat and potato,” added Shaw. \nThe head of the gambling commission said an investigation had started to make sure the gambling house, Sun Bets, had acted with “integrity.” \n“Integrity in sport is not a joke and we have opened an investigation to establish exactly what happened,” Richard Watson told The Guardian. “As part of that we’ll be looking into any irregularity in the betting market and establishing whether the operator has met its license requirement to conduct its business with integrity.” \nMORE SOCCER: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:32:28.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
