Read on to learn about 8 nutrients that are important for maintaining your sight, and the foods that contain them… We’ve all heard that eating right can help protect your vision. But which foods are best? When it comes to food and eye health, just remember three little words: fresh , wild and colorful , says optometrist Sandra Young, OD, an ocular nutritionist and the author of Visionary Kitchen: A Cookbook for Eye Health (Cookbook Marketplace). “There’s an entire symphony of nutrients in whole foods when they’re fresh,” she says. Wild-caught fish and free-range poultry and beef are higher in healthful omega-3 fatty acids, Young notes. And orange, red and dark green fruits and veggies are rich in vitamins A and C, along with trace minerals. These nutrients can help ward off eye problems such as macular degeneration and cataracts, Young says. Age-related macular degeneration – which causes damage to an area of the retina – is the leading cause of vision loss among seniors, according to the National Eye Institute (NEI). Cataracts, a clouding of the eye’s lens, are a common cause of vision impairment in people over 40. Read on to find out more about the nutrients you need for healthy eyes. 1. Vitamin C “Vitamin C is an antioxidant that’s found in every part of the eye,” Young says. Because it’s water-soluble, your body doesn’t hold on to it, she says. So you need to replenish it on a daily basis. The Recommended Daily Allowance is 75 mg for women and 85 mg for men, but Young recommends getting much more in your diet. “You can’t eat too much vitamin C,” she says. Fruits are a good source of the vitamin – a cup of orange juice has 124 mg, and grapefruit juice has 94 mg. But some vegetables are even better: A cup of chopped red bell peppers has 190 milligrams of vitamin C, and green bell peppers have 120 mg. 2. Vitamin E Vitamin E is another antioxidant; it protects eye cells from free-radical molecules that can break down healthy tissues and form cataracts, Young says. Everyone over age 14 needs at least 15 mg of vitamin E per day, the United States Department of Agriculture says. Foods highest in the vitamin include almonds (6.8 mg per ounce), sunflower seeds (6.9 mg), hazelnuts (4.3 mg) and peanut butter (2.9 mg in 2 tablespoons). Vegetable oils high in vitamin E include wheat-germ oil, with 20.3 mg per tablespoon, and sunflower oil, with 5.6 mg. 3. Lutein This nutrient belongs to the vitamin A family of antioxidants known as carotenoids, which also help protect eyes from free-radical damage, Young says. Studies show that 10 mg a day of lutein can reduce the risk of eye disease and improve vision in cataract patients, according to the American Optometric Association. You may think of orange and reddish vegetables – like, yes, carrots – as being rich in carotenoids, but they’re also found in leafy greens, in which the dark green coloring provided by chlorophyll covers up the lighter hues. Foods highest in lutein include cooked kale (23.8 mg per cup), spinach (20.4 mg per cup), broccoli, kiwi, pumpkin and green bell peppers. Steaming, sautéing or puréeing breaks down a plant’s cellulose fiber, increasing the body’s access to the lutein in dark, leafy greens, Young says. 4. Zeaxanthin Zeaxanthin is another essential nutrient in the vitamin A family that protects eyes from free-radical damage. About 2 mg a day is enough for good eye health, Young says. This nutrient is found in egg yolks, dried apricots, canned corn, orange bell peppers and goji berries – a “superfruit” available in some health food stores. Both zeaxanthin and lutein help protect your eyes from damaging ultraviolet rays, acting as “an internal sunscreen,” Young says. 5. Essential fatty acids Two kinds of omega-3 fatty acid help with healthy vision and function of the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye): docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). “DHA makes up 50%-60% of fatty acid content within the retina,” Young says. “Omega-3s are also anti-inflammatory and very important for neurological tissue, including the brain.” Omega-3s come from animal sources such as salmon and other cold-water fish, fortified eggs and grass-fed beef, she says. Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts and flaxseeds, also contain fatty acids, some of which the body can convert into DHA and EPA. An adequate intake of omega-3s is about 1.1 grams daily for adult women, according to the U.S. Office of Dietary Supplements. 6. Zinc Zinc is an essential trace mineral that helps transport vitamin A from the liver to the retina of the eye. That produces melanin, the eye’s protective pigment, Young explains. As a result, zinc helps protect against macular degeneration and night blindness, she says. Most men need at least 11 mg of zinc daily, while women require 8-9 mg, according to the USDA. Foods high in zinc for healthy eyes include shellfish such as oysters, lobster and clams, black-eyed peas, pumpkin seeds, tofu, free-range poultry and eggs. 7. Selenium Selenium is another trace mineral; it’s important for healthy eyes because of its antioxidant properties, Young says. Selenium also helps reduce eye-damaging inflammation caused by Graves’ disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects about 2% of women, according to a 2011 European study published in the New England Journal of Medicine . “Tuna and cremini mushrooms are my favorite high-selenium foods,” because they’re easily available and easy to prepare, Young says. Other foods high in selenium include mustard, garlic, onions, yogurt, almonds and sunflower seeds. 8. Herbs and spices Seasoning food with herbs and spices – whether fresh, dried or ground – can also help protect eye health. “Spices are a nutritional powerhouse,” Young says. Paprika is contains zeaxanthin, vitamin C and vitamin E. And green herbs such as cilantro, parsley and oregano are good sources of vitamin C and lutein, Young says. Yellow-orange spices such as turmeric and ginger have anti-inflammatory properties, and rosemary has been shown to support retinal health, she adds. These items also provide flavor to fresh dishes without adding extra salt, fat or calories, she notes. For more information and expert advice, visit Lifescript’s Vision Health Center .
