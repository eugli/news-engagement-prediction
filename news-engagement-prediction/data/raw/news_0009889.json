Kate is patron of Place2Be, which supports children at Mitchell Brook Primary School and helped organise Monday's \"Big Assembly\". A highlight of the day was Kate presenting the first \"Kindness Cup\" to the child who \"has shown exceptional kindness in their school community and beyond\". This year's recipient was Nadia Dhicis, a ten-year-old pupil who joined William and Kate on stage in the school hall as she received her gold trophy. Nadia was recognised for her efforts in looking after fellow pupils and her younger brother and sister, plus her volunteering at a local food bank. VIEW GALLERY Prince William and Kate spoke to children about kindness \nDuring the engagement, William and Kate listened to a group of children talk about how they rely on each other and the Place2Be counsellors for support. Counsellors Christine Roberts and Virginia Kocik are at the school every day and Place2Be underpins much of the school's ethos. \"Is being able to tell each other your worries, and the ability to keep a secret, most important?\" William asked the group. Kate added, \"Is it really important to have people around you who you can trust? And do you feel you can trust Place2Be?\" to which the youngsters all replied, \"Yes\". \nKate then praised the schoolchildren for having a buddy that they can trust and share their feelings with. \"It's great to be as articulate as you all are and understand the importance of your feelings,\" she said. William added: \"There are grownups who would not be as able to say what you have said. It's impressive.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:29:11.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
