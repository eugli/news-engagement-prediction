(Rahul Karmakar/HT File Photo) \nHuman rights activist Irom Sharmila plans to get married after the upcoming assembly elections in Manipur in March. \nSharmila made the announcement while speaking to reporters in Imphal on Thursday. \nSharmila had launched her fast-unto-death on November 4, 2000, demanding the repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958. \nDesmond Coutanho, an NRI originally from Goa, and Sharmila have been together for years. Desmond was in Imphal whenever Sharmila was tried in court for attempting to commit suicide. \nThe couple have also faced resistance. Coutanho was beaten up by women activists on the court campus after he was seen holding Sharmila’s hand inside the courtroom. A woman activist had said: “In Manipur, it is socially not acceptable.” Coutanho had stopped visiting Imphal after the incident. \nManipur has been demanding the implementation of the Inner Line Permit system to restrict the entry and stay of non-locals. \nCritics had questioned Coutanho’s presence and raised queries over how Sharmila was provided a cell phone and a laptop inside the prison. Since then, Coutanho has been critical of journalists, human rights activists and others who offering Sharmila help during the protracted campaign. \nSharmila on Thursday apologised for Coutanho’s rude behaviour. \nShe said: “On behalf of Desmond, I tender my apology and seek forgiveness.” \nVitriolic attacks by Coutanho were posted in the social media, which are expected to affect the upcoming polls in Imphal on March 4 and 8. \nSharmila will be contesting polls, including running against chief minister Okram Ibobi. She has promised to repeal AFSPA if she becomes the chief minister. \nWhen Sharmila ended her fast on August 9, 2016, she had no place to stay in Imphal as many, including her mother, did not welcome her. She had to return to the security ward in the Imphal hospital, where she had been fasting. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:37.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
