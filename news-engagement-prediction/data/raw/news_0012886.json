Ask that question to any financial expert, and I’m sure that across the board they’ll answer with a resounding “Yes!” \nI get it. \nYou already have enough on your plate. And, it may seem like a lot of work to get started and organized. However, tracking all of your expenses gives you a better understanding of how you're managing your money and could help you get some cash back. But, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. \nRegardless if you’re handing your an accountant a box full of receipts, creating a spreadsheet, or using an app, there are three main reasons why you need to keep tabs on your small business expenses. 1. You need this level of financial awareness. \nDo you know where your money goes each month? Is your business as financially healthy as you think? Tracking your expenses, even those small daily expenses like coffee and postage, warns you if there are any serious spending issues before you blow your budget . If you want to put more money into your bank account, you need to find out where your business is wasting money. \nTracking your expenses also ensures that you can reach your financial goals. By understanding your spending habits, you can make the appropriate changes so that you can ultimately achieve these aims. \nRelated: The Best Expense Tracking Software of 2016 2. You won't pay taxes that your don't owe . \nTracking your expenses can also benefit your during your least favorite time of year: tax season. If you have kept track of your expenses, you’ll be prepared to get the most deductions possible. The more deductions you’re eligible for, the lower your taxable income will be. \nSince the IRS doesn't work on the trust system, you need receipts and documentation to prove what you spent was “ordinary and necessary.” Be aware of the tax deductions you can claim, including overlooked expenses like travel, vehicle, education, inventory, meals and entertainment, home office, advertising and bad debts. 3. Get every available credit card reward. \nUse a credit card that has a sweet rewards program when making purchases for your business. For example , the Chase Freedom credit card allows you to earn up to five percent cash back on a variety of purchases. Additionally, look for cards that let you earn and redeem points for free flights and hotel stays. This will also be less work for your accountant and is easy for you to stay organized. \nTracking your expenses permits you to provide employees with prompt expense reimbursements when they have to pay for gas, airline tickets or meals out of their pocket. If you are always organized, you can pay them back quickly. This keeps them happy and fits into that full financial awareness I mentioned earlier. \nRelated: 7 Tips for Keeping Receipts Organized for Tax Time \nNow that you know the value of tracking every small business expense, here’s how you can easily monitor, track, and organize all of such expenditures. \nDon't mingle funds: Keep your business and personal finances separate .

This makes organizing your expenses easier and keeps you out of trouble from the IRS. \nKnow what you can deduct: This was touched upon earlier, but it deserves mention again. Know what you can deduct so that you lower your taxable income and stay in the good graces of the IRS . \nStay on top of your receipts: Whenever you have a receipt for an expense, make sure that you store them in an envelope or shoebox and the file them accordingly by month.

You can use Google Calendar to receive a notification to remind you of upcoming expenses or when recurring payments, like your utilities, are posted.
