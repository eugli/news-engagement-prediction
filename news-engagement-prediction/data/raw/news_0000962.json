like any country - has a right to control who may enter it'.\nVasile-Viorel Grosu, 37, was driving a lorry across Europe to England when he was approached in a truck park near Poitiers in western France to hide three Albanians - a man and two women - in his lorry.\nHe was offered money and agreed, but they were caught by Border Force officials on November 4 at Poole Harbour in Dorset.\nJudge Brian Forster QC, left, sentenced Vasile-Viorel Grosu, right, to two years in prison\nGrosu was sentenced to two years in jail by Bournemouth Crown Court.\nJudge Brian Forster QC said: 'This country, like any country, has a right to control who may enter it.\n'You did this for financial gain and those you brought in were not family members, they were people who you did not know.\n'I take into consideration that you were approached and agreed on the spur of the moment because it was an easy way to obtain money which would have benefited your family.'\nGrosu confessed to officers that he had met a Bulgarian man at a truck park in France who asked if he wanted to take people to the UK for extra money, in time for Christmas.\nHe said he agreed but claimed he didn't know it was illegal or realise the severity of the offence.\nGrosu, a Romanian lorry driver, smuggled three illegal immigrants into the UK in his lorry\nThe court heard Grosu immediately co-operated with officials when the Albanian immigrants were discovered and had no previous convictions.\nHe let the three people jump into the back of his lorry to the journey.\nOfficers were carrying out a search when one spotted a hand protruding from under some clothing lying on the top bunk of Grosu's cabin.\nBoth women were found lying under the clothes and the man was hidden within a void under the lower bunk bed.\nThe three Albanians were arrested, detained and deported back to Albania on November 6.\nGrosu pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to facilitate illegal entry into the UK, a breach of immigration law.\nJudge Brian Forster QC said: 'This country, like any country, has a right to control who may enter it'\nSpeaking through an interpreter the judge added: 'In essence you have assisted unlawful entry into this country by driving a lorry containing three people who were Albanian nationals and who did not have any form of permission to enter the United Kingdom.\n'This is a serious offence because it's an easy offence to commit.\n'There's a degree of chance as to whether you will be caught because it is not possible to search every single lorry.'\nNick Jupp, from Immigration Enforcement Criminal Investigations, said: 'If Grosu genuinely did not understand the stakes he was playing with when he attempted this criminal act, the custodial sentence handed to him by the courts can leave him under no illusions now.\n'This was a gamble that went badly wrong. People smuggling is a vile trade that treats often vulnerable individuals as commodities.\n'I hope this case serves as a warning to anyone tempted to get involved with this kind of crime. Working closely with Border Force colleagues we will identify the criminals behind illegal entry attempts and they will be jailed.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T11:11:54.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
