The couple confirmed their breakup earlier this month (Photo: FameFlynet.uk.com) \nDespite Kylie still not finding Mr. Right as of yet, she doesn't think she's been unlucky in love. \n\"I haven't had the white picket fence and happy ever after in my life, so far, but perhaps that' just not my destiny. I know love and I love to be in love,\" she added.
