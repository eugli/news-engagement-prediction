It was so powdered on the surface, it looked like baking soda or something like that,\" he said. \n\"I didn’t believe it was diamond, it was such a fine powder.\" \nDespite some physicists questioning the claim the sample was ever created, there are a number of reasons no evidence of metallic hydrogen remains. \nOne is that the small sample is lost in the metal gasket it was contained in. \nIt could also point to the theory that metallic hydrogen is unstable and turns into a gas at room temperature and normal pressure. \nThe latter theory means it would crush hopes of a new wonder material. \nDespite the loss, Professor Silva and his team will attempt their experiment in the next few weeks and are confident the results will be repeated. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:00:15.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
