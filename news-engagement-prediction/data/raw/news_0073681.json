(Photo: Hopper Stone) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLOS ANGELES — The stars of Hidden Figures have already won big time Oscars weekend, with the hilarious antics of Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe taking the most laughs at Saturday's Oscars rehearsal. \nThe threesome crack seriously funny during their practice for Sunday's Academy Awards show. It starts with Spencer, nominated for best supporting actress, who gives a boisterous \"Good morning!\" to the stage crew backstage. \"I hope you've had lots of coffee and doughnuts this morning,\" she tells them. \"And if anyone does know where the doughnuts are, can you tell me, please?\" \nOnstage, the zingers fly, especially when Henson comically runs off with the wooden practice Oscar used in rehearsals (she brought it back). \nHenson scans the rows in the massive Dolby Theatre for her seat and name placard but doesn't find it. She jokingly declares in true Cookie fashion, \"My star is bigger than the room!\" \nThey decided to strike a Charlie's Angels action pose as the curtain raises. Monáe isn't as boisterous as her co-stars, prompting Henson to point out, \"She's the straight one in this show.\" \n\"You don't understand, we are hams,\" Spencer adds. \nDwayne Johnson appears during a rehearsal for the 89th Academy Awards. (Photo: Matt Sayles, Invision/AP) \nThe Rock rolls through \nDwayne Johnson makes the most of his time onstage, posing with friends and for solo Rock pictures with the Dolby Theatre in the background. The busiest man in Hollywood has trouble making it out of the theater, stopping repeatedly to greet friends. During one extended chat, Johnson notices his 6-foot-5 frame is blocking the movement of backstage equipment. \"Yeah, maybe it's not such a great idea to be standing under a rig,\" he says, pulling his conversation to a less congested area. \nRyan Gosling and Emma Stone, together again \nLa La Land stars Ryan Gosling (bearded, with a baseball cap) and Emma Stone bring their comedy routine to the stage. Stone jolts as she starts talking and realizes her microphone is on. \n\"Hot mike,\" Gosling declares. They work through a slew of tough names. 'Moana' star Auli'i Cravalho lights up Oscars rehearsal stage \n\"Phew,\" Gosling says at the end. \n\"We did it, that was really hard,\" Stone announces. She gives Gosling a hug before the two head in separate directions, Gosling with his hands behind his back, rhythmically swinging his dangling Oscar credentials. \nAmy Adams is doubly adorable with her daughter \nWhen Amy Adams walks onstage with daughter Aviana Olea Le Gallo, 6, the duo is dressed in matching gray sweatshirts with \"Good Vibes Only\" across the front (and rainbows on the arms). The two pose for pictures onstage before Aviana takes a seat to watch from the front row. The two make goo-goo eyes at each other during fake acceptance speeches. \"You're so silly,\" Adams tells her from the stage. \nMark Rylance, left, and stage manager Gary Natoli at a rehearsal for the 89th Academy Awards. (Photo: Matt Sayles, Invision/AP) \nCaring about fake winners \nAfter presenting fake Oscars to stand-in actors, who then give fake acceptance speeches, Jason Bateman goes the extra mile. As he walks offstage, Bateman realizes he still has the prop envelope in his hands. \"I forgot to give the fake winners their envelopes,\" he says with a straight face to a backstage worker. \"Can you make sure they get that? They love to keep the winning envelope.\" \nJamie Dornan, left, and Dakota Johnson at rehearsals for the 89th Academy Awards. (Photo: Matt Sayles, Invision/AP) \n'Fifty Shades' of Oscar \nFifty Shades Darker co-stars Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson make a glamorous couple even in casual clothes, entering the art-deco stage with Johnson's arm draped over Dornan's. The two search for their seats. \"I'm way in the corner,\" Johnson announces. Dornan does one better, pointing to the top rafters where he pretends to spy his own seat. \nDuring a long-winded fake acceptance speech, Johnson starts counting down for the orchestra to play off: \"10, 9, 8.\" \nDornan finishes the countdown as the fake actor concludes his speech. \nJudd Apatow watches his wife Leslie Mann (not pictured) during rehearsals for the 89th Academy Awards. (Photo: Matt Sayles, Invision/AP) \nComedic couple on board \nLeslie Mann has her No. 1 supporter standing next to her as she practices her presentation: Husband and director Judd Apatow is taking her picture with his iPhone. When Mann doesn't like what she reads on the teleprompter, she cracks, \"Did you write this?\" Undeterred, Apatow steps offstage, proudly taking a picture of Mann's Oscar seat.
