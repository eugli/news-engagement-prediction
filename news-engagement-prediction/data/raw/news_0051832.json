Waukegan's Bryant Brown (25) makes a 3-pointer as Stevenson's Aidan O'Connell defends on Friday. (Mark Ukena / Lake County News-Sun) Privacy Policy \nBryant Brown didn't want to think about the shot for too long. \nThe Waukegan sophomore forward had just received a pass in the right corner. The Bulldogs trailed Stevenson by a point late in the fourth quarter. \n\"I just caught it in rhythm and put it up,\" Brown said. \"I hit a couple earlier in the game and I was feeling my shot.\" \nBrown made the 3-pointer to give Waukegan the lead with 1:03 remaining. The Bulldogs held on for a 61-58 victory in a North Suburban thriller on Friday at Waukegan. \n\"I'm very proud of our guys,\" Waukegan coach Ron Ashlaw said. \"That's a well-earned win by our players.\" \nCarson Newsome scored 27 points to lead Waukegan (16-8, 8-4). Brown had 18 points. \n\"We've had our better players play well consistently now for a few games in a row,\" Ashlaw said. \nSophomore Ja'Dyn Brown scored eight points, including two free throws with 9.7 seconds remaining to give the Bulldogs a three-point lead. \n\"I like shooting under pressure,\" Ja'Dyn Brown said. \"It just had to go in. Carson told me to line my free throws up before I shot them. That's what I did and they both went in.\" \nJustin Smith scored 27 points to lead Stevenson. Tyrek Washington and Willie Herenton both had 10 points for the Patriots (20-5, 11-2), who bounced back to beat Morgan Park 60-58 in overtime Saturday at the City-Suburban Showdown at Robert Morris University in Arlington Heights. \nStevenson, the conference champion, defeated Waukegan 59-37 the first time the teams played on Jan. 21. \n\"This game was a little bit faster, a little more offensive-minded,\" Stevenson coach Pat Ambrose said. \"This was more of an offensive, up-tempo game and we needed to do a better job of getting stops.\" \nNewsome helped Waukegan get to an early lead. \nThe Bulldogs started the second quarter with a 9-2 run. Newsome scored seven points during the stretch to help Waukegan to a 26-14 lead. \n\"We moved the ball,\" Ja'Dyn Brown said. \"Last time we were too stagnant. We went fast. We didn't slow down. We got the advantage by doing that.\" \nStevenson rallied and took the lead in the third quarter. The Patriots led 47-45 going to the fourth quarter. \nStevenson still led with less than three minutes remaining in the game when Newsome got fouled attempting a 3-point shot. He made all three free throws to bring Waukegan within 57-56 with 2:22 to go. \nIt remained that way until Bryant Brown's 3-pointer. Ja'Dyn Brown added his two free throws in the final seconds. Stevenson missed a tough 3-pointer at the buzzer giving Waukegan a big win as the postseason nears. \n\"We know what we can do, we know what we are capable of,\" Ja'Dyn Brown said. \"(Stevenson is) a state-championship contender.\" \nTwitter @lamondpope", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T06:55:53.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
