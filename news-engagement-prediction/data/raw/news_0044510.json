PA:Press Association 5 Yoan Gouffran stabs home Newcastle’s first-half opener from a corner \nLansbury was accused of making the most of two separate situations which led to red cards for Jonjo Shelvey and Paul Dummett, both of which were overturned. \nSo how the Geordie faithful delighted when the 26-year-old gaffed to double Newcastle’s lead here, after Yoan Gouffran’s opener, and send the hosts back to the top of the Championship. \nLansbury’s error also contributed to an alarming EIGHTH defeat in nine for Villa, who are now in a relegation battle given it is only a six-point gap to the drop zone. \nIt made for another frustrating night for Villa’s Geordie chief Steve Bruce, particularly as his side bossed the first half. Reuters 5 Henri Lansbury bundled the ball into his own net with 30 minutes left on the clock \nNewcastle did not even muster a chance until they scored in the 42nd minute as Villa starved the supply line to Dwight Gayle by shutting down Shelvey. \nAnd the visitors had their chances. \nBirkir Bjarnason, the Icelander who helped embarrass England at the Euros and signed in January, somehow volleyed wide from a few yards out after being teed up by Scott Hogan’s looping header. \nWhile Jonathan Kodjia, deployed out left to accommodate Hogan, had a shot loop up off DeAndre Yedlin that looked to be floating in, only for Karl Darlow to tip over brilliantly. \nIt would have been a shot in the arm for Darlow after his ‘Karlamity’ mis-kick against Norwich last week which played a part in Newcastle dropping points at Carrow Road.

Reuters 5 Henri Lansbury angered Newcastle fans after his role in Toon’s 2-1 defeat against Nottingham Forest earlier this season \nSo few would have been surprised when Gouffran broke the deadlock with Newcastle’s first shot – as that has just been Villa’s luck this season. \nMatt Ritchie exchanged a short corner with Shelvey before whipping in a cross to the back post which Jamaal Lascelles attacked. \nA melee ensued as Villa failed to clear and from the wreckage emerged Gouffran to lash in from six yards. \nOne became two on the hour as Lansbury suffered his embarrassing moment. PA:Press Association 5 Newcastle are back to the top of the Championship following the 2-0 victory \nLascelles flicked Shelvey’s corner towards the near post guarded by Lansbury, who cleared it onto the post only for the ball to rebound back off him and into the net. \nThat sparked chants of ‘Let’s all laugh at Lansbury’, while the goal-scorer announcement on the Tannoy cued the biggest cheer of the night. \nFrom then, it was all Newcastle, barring a super stop from Darlow when Bjarnason found himself clean through. \nRitchie and Jack Colback both saw efforts denied by Sam Johnstone but by then the damage was done, as Benitez’s boys took another step in their journey back to the Promised Land. \nVilla’s night went from bad to worse as striker Hogan, signed for £12m in January, was carried off on a stretcher late on after twisting his ankle in the turf. \nIt was terrible luck for Bruce and Hogan, who suffered two anterior cruciate ligament injuries earlier in his career, and led to six minutes of injury time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:10:33.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
