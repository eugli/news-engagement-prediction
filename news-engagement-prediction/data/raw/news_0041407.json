The Providence Brain and Spine Institute (PBSI) designed and implemented a healthcare analytics initiative for partner sites that addresses national standards in acute stroke care. To meet those standards, PBSI partners were empowered with contextualized and benchmarked data for monitoring, measuring and improving stroke care in their facilities, leading to superior patient outcomes. Inova Health System: Enabling Precision Medicine \nTuesday, February 21 at 1:00-1:30 p.m. | C&BI Knowledge Center, Hall D, # 6779 \nAaron Black, Director of Informatics Learn how the Inova Translational Medicine Institute (ITMI) is leading path-breaking innovation and Precision Medicine by mapping clinical genomic data from new-born children with healthcare informatics. This empowers researchers, physicians and clinicians to proactively identify biomarkers for personized treatment delivery, assuring superior outcomes and healthier babies. In practice What do healthcare leaders have to say? \nIn the drive to improve patient and population health outcomes and efficiency, healthcare organizations are turning to data more than ever before. But the sheer diversity and volume of the data generated within even a mid-sized healthcare system can quickly become overwhelming. \nClick the video on the left to hear what healthcare analytics leaders are saying.
