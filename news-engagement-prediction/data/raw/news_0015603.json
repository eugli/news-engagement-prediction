I think they should be able to do both, but don't get me started on that.\n'Derby, they've got 5,000 fans here tonight. What a chance to beat their local rivals and go into the next round.\n'It hasn't worked for a lot of the big clubs, has it? When they've rested teams, they've been on bad runs after it. I think it's all about momentum, but I've said that before.\n'We wonder why we're not producing strong kids with strong mentality, because from the age of 12, watching on television, managers keep telling everyone - and them - that players can't play three games in a week.\n'So when they get to 18 and a manager says (you're going to play three games in a week), they say \"hang on a minute, all I've ever heard is I can't play three games in a week\".'\nAnd former Foxes manager Martin O'Neill believed Leicester might have passed up a chance to add more silverware to their trophy cabinet after seeing the initial selection.\nFormer Leicester City manager Martin O'Neill thought they may have passed up silverware\n'I have to say that this is an opportunity to try and win a cup,' he said. 'At home, I would go as strongly as I possibly could.\n'It's a consideration at the end of the season - if you don't get promotion or you don't achieve the goals that you set yourself - then you just feel gutted about it, that you haven't actually gone and participated in this competition in its full fashion.'\nRobbie Savage was equally baffled by Steve McClaren's decision to field a weakened side.\nRobbie Savage could not believe Derby had selected such a weak line-up for the game\nSavage continued: 'They're eighth in the Championship, they're going for that play-off spot. But I think they've got three home games to come.\n'They've got Bristol City, who are struggling in the league at home at the weekend - why not go and play their strongest side? I don't get it. As Alan says, there are 5,000 Derby fans.\n'Millwall away in the next round, which is an opportunity for these two sides to go to Millwall and win, although they've done great, beating Premier League sides. But I just don't get it, I really don't. What an opportunity to get confidence, for both sides.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T16:09:51.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
