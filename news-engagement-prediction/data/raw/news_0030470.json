LaMarcus Aldridge (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:02 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:02 a.m. ET \nThe Warriors' starting lineup is made up almost entirely of All-Stars, and LaMarcus Aldridge feels like the Spurs are pretty good, too. \nHe has somewhat of a point considering the 41-13 Spurs aren't too far behind the 46-8 Warriors. But the voting process didn't agree with him as the Warriors have four members of their team represented at the All-Star game while the Spurs have just one. \nMORE: Players hate the Warriors and other observations from All-Star voting \n“I’m older, so I’m not going to come home and be mad or anything,” Aldridge told The Vertical . “But I do think that it was wrong for Golden State to have four [All-Stars] and we’re a few games behind and only have one. It is what it is. I’m in this position and I’m going to enjoy my break and just come back fresh.” \nThe Warriors' All-Stars are who you'd expect: Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. The Spurs' lone star is Kawhi Leonard. \nWhile San Antonio does have a great team, you can pretty much leave it at that. Leonard deserved the All-Star nod, but it's hard to give it to anyone else on the roster. The Warriors, meanwhile, have four players who obviously earned their bids.
