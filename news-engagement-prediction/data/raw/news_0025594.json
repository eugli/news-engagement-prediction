WOMEN'S REVOLUTION \nHowever, it seems like it comes at a cost, as not everybody can be that fortunate. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

Article continues below \nYou can argue that she was hardly a part of the women’s division, as she never wrestled but she was a big part of Total Divas, something WWE invested heavily in. RETIREMENT \nMendes – who managed the likes of Fandango as well as Primo and Epico – initially took time away from WWE to become a mother but reiterated her desire to come back. \nHowever, it looks as if motherhood, as well as other ventures, have understandably taken priority, and in a series of Instagram posts she’s confirmed she’s done with the company. \nAn excerpt from her posts read: “So the day I am announcing my retirement from WWE. As I write these words, I have tears in my eyes because of the love I have for my WWE family, and especially for the WWE Universe. \n“For the last 10 years, WWE was my life, my world and my family. I was Rosa Mendes. Now I am Milena Roucka, Jordan’s mother, a soon-to-be wife and a hard-working mother.” \nWhile thanking her colleagues, she also gave a shout out to Vince McMahon. \nShe added: “Last, but not least, Vince McMahon, thank you for giving me the opportunity to do what I loved for so many years, and the amazing WWE Universe. Your support and your love means the world to me.” \nFans may argue that she’s not a huge loss to the in-ring division, but it’s clear the company saw enough value in her to keep her around for a decade. \nWhat are your thoughts on Rosa Mendes’ retirement?
