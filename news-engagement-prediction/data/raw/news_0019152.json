Take our main dude Nick Viall from the current season of “ The Bachelor ,” for example. \nPeople have pointed out he has his moments both on camera and in pictures when he’s smoking hot, but he also has other moments that aren’t on par with his ultimate prime. \nWe all have our best picture days when we’re on cloud nine. You’re absolutely loving life because you have a camera roll full of Instagram-worthy pics. \nThere are also the other very depressing days where you want to literally rip your hair out because you can’t get the ultimate selfie. UGH. \nThe struggle can be so damn real, and there’s honestly nothing you can do about it until you have one of your good moments to cope with the bad moments. \nI’ve put together a little poem we can most likely all relate to, using Nick Viall to show us what it feels like to be a “moments guy.” \nBecause as we all know, Nick has MANY moments. We’ve seen him rock plaid. ABC We’ve seen him look sad . ABC We’ve seen him pout. ABC We’ve seen him doubt. ABC We’ve seen him drink. ABC We’ve seen him in pink. ABC We’ve seen his chest. ABC We’ve seen his very best. ABC We’ve seen him look smokin’ hot. ABC … and when he’s not. ABC We’ve seen him look like he’s ready to cuddle. ABC We’ve seen him muddle. ABC We’ve seen him look normal. ABC … and dressed for a formal. ABC We’ve seen him give a rose. ABC … and strike a pose . ABC \nThere are many of us – if not all of us – out there who are “moments people,” and let me tell you… it’s totally OK. \nBecause when all is said and done, it’s your moments that make you who you are. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
