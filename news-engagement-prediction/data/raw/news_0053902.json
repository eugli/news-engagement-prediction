(Erik White/CBC)\nThe plan says under this model, firefighters would be able to reach 90 per cent of Greater Sudbury within nine minutes, where they currently cover 69 per cent.\nIt will also see the annual operating budget for the fire department increase by about $6 million by 2026, plus the millions that would have to be spent building and renovating fire stations.\nThe optimization plan also calls for an end to the area rating tax model, where people in the outlying areas of Greater Sudbury, such as Dowling, Capreol or Hanmer, currently pay less taxes because they were traditionally served by volunteer firefighters.\nThis would see some tax bills climb by several hundred dollars a year.\nThe tax increase is likely to be one of the concerns brought up at a series of public meetings on the plan, which start Feb. 27 at the Kinsmen Hall in Lively at 6:30 p.m, with another session in Coniston on March 1 at the Colonial Inn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:31:18.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
