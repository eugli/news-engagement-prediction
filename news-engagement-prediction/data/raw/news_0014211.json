Patty Murray of Washington said Monday. \"And I strongly encourage people across the country to join us — to double down on your advocacy — and to keep making your voices heard for these last 24 hours.\" Last week two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski, said they would no vote to confirm DeVos, but if all the remaining Republicans vote for her nomination, she would be confirmed with addition of Vice President Mike Pence's vote as the tie-breaker.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T20:30:04.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
