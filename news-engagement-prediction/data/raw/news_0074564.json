The film was part of a crowded field that included a variety of films from different genres. Laika’s Kubo and the Two Strings brought some stop-motion flair to the proceedings, Deepwater Horizon showed off Industrial Light & Magic’s ability to recreate real-world locations dealing the most harrowing of situations, and The Jungle Book was able to create a photorealistic world where humans could interact with walking, talking animals. However, it was ILM’s blockbuster work on Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Doctor Strange that seemed to lead the field. The latter film’s surreal, mind-bending visuals — which called to mind everything from Inception to 2001: A Space Odyssey — seemed a particularly likely candidate, as did the digitally-recreated Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher that featured in Rogue One . Instead, it was director Jon Favreau’s reimagining of Disney’s classic animated film that took home the prize. The win should only bolster Disney’s confidence in its live-action strategy — or should we say, visual-effects-and-live-action strategy — and the studio will have plenty of opportunities to build off tonight’s visual effects success. Favreau is also set to direct a similar remake of The Lion King , as well as a sequel to The Jungle Book itself.
