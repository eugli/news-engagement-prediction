A live power line inhibited access to the car and the rescue was temporarily delayed until the power was halted by Fortis Alberta staff.\nMembers of the Coaldale Fire Department extricated the driver from the wreckage and she was transported by ambulance to the Chinook Regional Hospital in Lethbridge in non-life threatening condition with injuries to her back and head.\nNo other injuries have been reported.\nRCMP have determined the car was travelling northbound when it crossed the tracks into the path of an oncoming westbound train. According to witnesses, the train crossing lights were active and the train's horn was activated prior to the crash.\nThe Coaldale RCMP detachment and CP Rail officials continue to investigate the incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:56:33.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
