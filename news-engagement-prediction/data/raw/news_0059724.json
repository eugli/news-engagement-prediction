Despite the craziness of the past month, the state’s Repulican senator insists there is reason for optimism. Sen. Todd Young in his Washington office in January, 2017. 290 CONNECT 12 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSo, I asked Sen. Todd Young, is Washington, D.C., as dysfunctional up close as it seems from afar? \nSitting over a cup of coffee at a breakfast joint near Downtown, the state’s junior senator offered this response: “That’s a complicated question.” \nHey, these are complicated times. \nYoung told me that Capitol Hill “is certainly dysfunctional if you benchmark the rate at which Congress has approved this administration’s nominees.” Or some of the rhetoric. Still, time and again Young argued that he sees the potential for positive movement on big issues in the coming months and years. \nYoung is a conservative Republican, obviously. But he’s not a bomb-thrower and he keeps partisanship at arm’s length in his speeches and conversations. You get the sense that he’d prefer not talk about the current craziness in Washington because — well, because he tells you very clearly that he’d rather not talk about it. He’s among those lawmakers who routinely dodge questions from the Capitol Hill press corps about the latest political uproar. \nBut he did offer an insider’s perspective on the political show we’re all watching from several hundred miles away. That perspective doesn’t include sharp criticism but the critiques are there if you listen hard enough. \n“I don’t want to personalize it to an individual, or even to a party, but there is a fervent call by so many members of the Democratic base to their representatives to resist, and to at least cosmetically demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the current state of things,” Young said. “They don’t have enough votes, so the only mechanism my Senate Democratic colleagues have to make clear they are listening is to slow down the process.” \nAbout Trump, Young argued “he has overperformed” when it comes to the caliber of his cabinet nominees. Beyond that, he said, “it’s too early to judge his performance.” But, he added, “There is a responsibility as president to choose your words carefully, especially on foreign policy, and to speak as clearly as possible. He has sent mixed signals at times with respect to our nation’s foreign policy.” \nI asked Young about the lack of outrage from within Republican ranks, with the exception of a few members, such as Sens. John McCain and Lindsay Graham, to reports of Russian interference in our elections. He calmly said that he supports an investigation by the Intelligence Committee but doesn’t see the need to yell about it. “John McCain and Lindsay Graham have a habit of communicating with great passion and regularity,” he said. “I have great respect for both individuals, but their style is not everyone’s style.” \nWe talked about Obamacare, which Young insists is unsustainable and whose replacement he believes this Congress and president are capable of achieving, even though years of complaining have not resulted in a comprehensive, agreed-upon GOP plan. “I’m still hopeful that the American people are going to insist that Democrats and Republicans work together this go-around.” \nI am, too. But after six years, and amid even more dysfunction, is that possible? \n“We have to do it,” Young said. \nIndiana politics is far from perfect, and I disagree wholeheartedly with the way Republicans have taken on Obamacare over the years — doing nothing to improve it as they insisted on its repeal. With that in mind, and with polls now showing the law to be more popular than before, it’s nice to see senators such as Young at least offer a milder argument these days. “Our objective is not to blow things up,” he said. “We want stability in the transition from an unsustainable program into this new health care environment.” \nHow Republicans guide the country into that environment, and how Americans feel about the new plan, could be the defining policy issue of the coming years. \nOn Tuesday, Young was much more interested in talking policy than politics. And so he talked about his effort to bring more entrepreneurship into the tackling of social problems, and to address the heavy student loan debts that so many graduates face. He spoke about the opportunity for Indiana to benefit greatly from new infrastructure spending, and about legislation to reform the State Department. He came across, as he always does, like a thoughtful and pragmatic politician. Let’s hope he keeps that style intact during what are sure to be some bruising D.C. battles in the months to come. \nAs for that first question I asked, the one about D.C. dysfunction, Young offered this addendum: “It’s not as emotional as one might perceive it to be from the outside.” \nThat’s good. Because from the outside, it looks quite emotional. \nThank you for reading.
