USA TODAY Sports Executive director of the Major League Players Association Tony Clark answers questions at a news conference Sunday. (Photo: Morry Gash, AP) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPHOENIX - Tony Clark, executive director of the Major League Players Association, listens to the consternation, the rule change proposals, and the idea that baseball needs to step up with the times. \nSorry, he just doesn’t buy the need for dramatic change. \nClark assured reporters Sunday afternoon in a 90-minute press conference that the only potential rule change this year would be the possible elimination of the intentional walk. \nThat’s it. \nHe scoffed at the idea of imposing an extra-inning rule at the Major League level of starting the 10th inning with a runner at second base. There will be no pitch clock. And the elimination of the low strike, which naturally invoked a difference of opinion between hitters and pitchers, won’t change, at least for the near future. \n“So how do you have a conversation about more offense in less period of time,’’ Clark said, “with a guy on the mound dictating terms?’’? \nThe game of baseball, Clark insists, even with games lasting 3 hours, is doing just fine. \n“There has been so much dialogue the last few years,’’ Clark said, “that changing or making adjustment is becoming more challenging when taking into account the industry as a whole and how it’s doing. \n“Guys are progressive. Guys understand innovation. Guys understand thinking about tomorrow and protecting against the future. \n“I don’t know if there’s a more vested group than the players when it comes to the game, and the respect for it, and the always dangerous proposition of our game turning into something that love it and respect it, don’t recognize it as much anymore.’’ \nClark, 44, a former 15-year major-league veteran, addressed a myriad of topics throughout his media session: \n_Clark was perturbed by New York Yankees president Randy Levine’s comments ridiculing the $5 million arbitration request by reliever Dellin Betances and his agent, even after the Yankees prevailed at $3 million. \n“The most troubling thing is that conversation and the particulars related to that case was made public,’’ Clark said, “which is unprecedented and unprofessional, and should never have happened in the fashion it did.’’ Gallery: Best pictures from Spring Training Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
