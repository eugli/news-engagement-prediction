Article continues below \nUnfortunately, Deeney could not continue his good run against Jose Mourinho's United, and he looked to relax and unwind in his birthplace of Birmingham after the game. \nThe climax of his night out back home saw the forward threatened with pepper spray from police. Article continues below Video: Twitter absolutely loves what Pep Guardiola said to Arter at full-time \nSo what happened? \nA source told The Sun: “Troy was being pestered for picture all night by this guy but didn’t want to pose for it which irritated the guy. \n“Troy’s mate told him no and then Troy was punched by him and then again by one of the photo bloke’s pals. Everyone was then removed from the club.” \nOnce outside of the club, it is believed a policeman showed Deeney the spray in a bid to calm him down and ensure that he behaved. \nAlthough it doesn't sound like Deeney orchestrated this altercation, he certainly is a burly, imposing figure and police would naturally try and keep him calm. \nIt's also worth noting that the Hornets skipper has previous in this kind of area. Back in 2012, Deeney was sentenced to ten months imprisonment for kicking a man in the head during a brawl, but would only serve three months of that sentence. \nIt may have been easier for Deeney to just pose for a photo, but that is still his choice at the end of the day and the 'fan' should have respected that. \nNo further action was taken by police regarding the incident and Deeney will want to put it behind him, quickly. \nWatford have nearly two weeks until their next game with West Ham and Hornets fans will be hoping Deeney makes the headlines for all the right reasons on that occasion. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
