However, many refused to accept the provincial government’s claim given the intensity of the blast and the recent wave of terror attacks across the country. Gulberg Lahore hit, after the blast in Y Block Lahore. #LahoreUnderAttack \n— Shehryar Taseer (@shehryar_taseer) February 23, 2017 \nWhen former Punjab governor Slaman Taseer’s son Shehryar Taseer tweeted that a blast had struck Lahore, PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari’s daughter Aseefa Zardari wondered why the provincial government still insisted that it was a generator blast. “Govt of Punjab still thinks it’s a generator,” she tweeted.

Perhaps Govt of Punjab should stop playing politics & funding terrorist activities from Muirdke.
