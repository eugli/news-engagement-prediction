Daily Edition Bloomberg Cancels White House Correspondents' Dinner Party 2:06 PM PST 2/24/2017 by Erik Hayden Getty Images Michael Bloomberg The business outlet has co-hosted the event with Vanity Fair, but the Conde Nast magazine backed out earlier this month. \nAnother major media outlet has decided to scrap a glitzy White House Correspondents' Dinner-themed event in light of the President's war of words against the press. \nOn Friday, Bloomberg canceled its annual, exclusive gala at the French Ambassador's residence on April 29. The company declined to elaborate further on the reason for the cancelation. Mike Allen first reported the move at Axios . \nThe business, data and terminal outlet normally co-hosts the event with Vanity Fair , but the Conde Nast magazine backed out of the event earlier this month. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who owns the company, called Trump a \"dangerous demagogue\" during an address at the Democratic National Convention in July. \nOn Feb. 3, The New Yorker also canceled plans to host a party at the W Hotel a block away from the Trump administration's White House. Both editors of the Conde Nast publications, Graydon Carter and David Remnick, have been sharply critical of the President in recent bylines in their magazines. \nOther outlets holding events on the day of the annual Washington D.C. \"Nerd Prom\" include CNN, which has been targeted as \"fake news\" by Trump. The Atlantic magazine also annually hosts an event with its sister brand National Journal and CBS News. \nThe White House Correspondents' Association, which typically has named an emcee for the April evening by now, has yet to settle on a host. Last year, comedian Larry Wilmore held court for President Obama's final event. \nThe WHCA group's last statement, earlier this month, said that the event will go on as planned. This year, not only are journalists and media types hesitant to appear at the dinner, there's also counter programming. \nThe same evening, TBS host Samantha Bee is planning to hold a \"Not the White House Correspondentsâ€™ Dinner\" at the Willard Hotel in the nation's capital, fundraising to support the Committee to Protect Journalists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:25:31.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
