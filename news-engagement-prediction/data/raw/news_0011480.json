Photo: Brett Coomer, Staff Was Tom Brady's game-winning jersey stolen after the Super Bowl? 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nAfter Sunday's big win, victorious quarterback Tom Brady realized that some sticky-fingered football-lover may have snagged his jersey from the New England Patriots' locker room. \n\"It was right here. I know exactly where I put it,\" Brady said as he scoured the NRG Stadium locker area on the hunt for his game-winning garb, according to USA Today . \nThe flustered star called for security and team equipment managers to help him in his hunt. Eventually, other players pitched in on the search - but to no avail. \n\"This is not good,\" he said. \"It was right here and now I don't have it. Not good.\" \nThe NFL even put out a call for help. \n\"Hey can someone give Tom Brady his jersey back?\" the NFL tweeted. \nAs he left the stadium, Brady told reporters he still hadn't found the valuable jersey. \n\"It is going to be on eBay soon,\" he quipped.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:18:27.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
