The Commons' defence select committee will today hear how translators who risked their lives to protect British forces have been 'abandoned' in the war-torn country. The inquiry – a breakthrough for the Daily Mail's Betrayal of the Brave campaign – will hear from interpreter Rafi Hottak, who was critically injured while on patrol with UK troops in 2007 and fled to Britain after facing Taliban threats. Mr Hottak will tell the committee Afghan interpreters could be killed if they are not given sanctuary in Britain. He will say Afghanistan is 'more dangerous than ever' for interpreters, who live in fear of revenge attacks as a result of their work for UK troops. The two-hour hearing today – which around a dozen Afghan interpreters will attend – follows a Daily Mail campaign highlighting how interpreters who risked their lives for British troops have been branded 'spies' by the Taliban and have been targeted as a result. Last night Lib Dem peer Lord Ashdown, who has championed the cause of Afghan war interpreters, said: 'The announcement of an inquiry is a welcome start … It is dishonourable that our nation refuses to pay the debt it owes to these Afghans. 'The Government's policy towards Afghan interpreters has been inexplicable, inhumane and a matter of shame for all of us. These people have risked their lives.' More than 178,000 former generals, military commanders, MPs, soldiers and members of the public have signed a petition calling for interpreters to be given sanctuary in the UK. BRITAIN HAS DESERTED ME David Cameron's former translator says he is forced to live in hiding in Afghanistan because he is being targeted by the Taliban. The 28-year-old, known to UK forces as Shaffy, said he 'lives in the shadows constantly fearing revenge attacks' four years after his six-year role ended. He believes he has been 'deserted' by the UK to 'our common enemy' after being told he did not qualify to come to Britain despite providing details of death threats. 'It is now more dangerous than when the British left Afghanistan two years ago,' he said. 'The Taliban is stronger and Daesh [Islamic State] is here … I cannot even live with my wife and family because it puts them in danger.' Shaffy said he was told he would 'die like a dog' days after being seen on British and Afghan TV with Mr Cameron in 2011. He added: 'The British authorities know all about my case. I have asked to be allowed to come to the UK … But they just say, 'sorry, no' … I saved British lives.' Currently, there are two policies under which this can happen. But the first scheme has an arbitrary cut-off point – which means hundreds of interpreters are not allowed to apply for it. No one has been admitted under a second intimidation scheme because the Ministry of Defence claims interpreters have to prove they are under threat. The committee will hear from Armed Forces minister Mike Penning and Colonel Simon Diggins OBE, former British defence attache in Kabul. Mr Hottak, 30, worked for two years on the front line in Afghanistan with UK troops, including special forces. On patrol in Helmand Province in November 2007, he was hit by a Taliban bomb that killed a British Army captain. Mr Hottak was saved by British doctors at Camp Bastion. He had 160 stitches. He was later tasked with running an expanded translator scheme for UK forces, which included recruiting. As a result he and his family were targeted by the Taliban and received death threats. He was forced to flee with the help of people smugglers and claimed asylum in the UK. Mr Hottak studies accountancy and helps translators who have fled to Europe or are still in Afghanistan. He said: 'There is considerable evidence that the policy towards translators is not fair. There was no logic to the cut-off point imposed for who would qualify to come to the UK. 'Many of those who did not qualify under the scheme took the greatest risks for the British and faced the greatest threat of revenge as a result. The sacrifice and risks they took to keep British lives safe … many, many lives, has not been recognised.' He will tell the inquiry the UK has a 'moral duty' to look after those who looked after them. Rosa Curling, of law firm Leigh Day which represents Mr Hottak, said former interpreters were owed a 'great debt of honour'. She added: 'The British Forces operating in Afghanistan could not have functioned without the assistance of locally employed staff … who exposed themselves to considerable personal risk.'
