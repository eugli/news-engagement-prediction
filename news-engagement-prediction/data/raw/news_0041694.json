(RCMP)\nA Moncton man who fired shots at the home of his ex-girlfriend and her two children was sentenced Monday to a total of nine years in prison.\nShawn Murray Fredericks got eight years for discharging a firearm while being reckless about whether anyone was inside, and a consecutive year for possessing a firearm despite a life-long weapons prohibition.\nA jury found him guilty of both offences during a three-week trial last fall.\nOn May 15, 2015, Fredericks fired shots from his vehicle at the home of his ex-girlfriend, with whom he had lived for two years.\nNo one was hurt in the shooting, which followed an argument between Fredericks and his ex-girlfriend, and a physical altercation between Fredericks and one of the woman's male friends outside her home.\nThe woman has two young daughters — to whom Fredericks said he was a father figure — but they weren't at home.\n\"Shooting at a residence where it was known to the accused that two young children resided with their mother is beyond understanding,\" Justice Jean-Paul Ouellette said during the sentencing Monday.\n\"He took justice into his own hands and this cannot be tolerated in our society.\"\nThat Fredericks didn't know who was home when he started shooting was one of several aggravating factors that Ouellette said \"cumulate into a lengthy sentence.\"\nOther factors were that Fredericks targeted his ex-girlfriend and did so in a residential area, in front of a woman and her five-year-old child. The judge said he also considered the accused's worsening encounters with the law.\nSince the 2015 incident, Fredericks has spent about 21 months in custody, but the judge gave him 32 months credit for it, as the defence recommended. This will reduce the eight-year sentence to five years and four months, but the one-year consecutive term remains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:36:54.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
