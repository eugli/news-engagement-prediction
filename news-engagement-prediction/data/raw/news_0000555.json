Braves 2017 spring training cap (Courtesy of MLB) \nUpdated at 5:59 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:59 p.m. ET \nPermit me a brief rant about something important: Those dumb, unnecessary MLB hat patches. \nFor the second straight season, MLB's spring training hats feature a shield-shaped patch on the side that announces either \"FL\" for Florida or \"AZ\" for Arizona, the two places where spring training has been held for decades, in case you didn't know. But of course you knew. \nThis unnecessary decoration is just that — a decoration. A decoration that ruins an otherwise fine piece of headwear. A decoration that continues the silly trend of destroying the sanctity of on-field hats with patches for various events: spring training, the All-Star Game, the postseason, the World Series. That's not even counting the logo for New Era, MLB's cap manufacturer, which will adorn on-field hats during the regular season for the first time in 2017. \nEnough with the hat decorations, MLB. \nMORE: When do pitchers and catchers report? \nI suppose the idea is to sell more hats by advertising them as event-specific headwear, hoping to persuade fans that by forking over $35 they're getting something special, a real novelty. Except, of course, that these patches only serve to make the hats ugly. As was the case with Friday's announcement, the unveiling of the hats is often met with fire emojis on social media. I suppose this means some people think hats still look sharp, even with the patches. These people are wrong. Even the most otherwise attractive hat is rendered unpurchaseable (is that a word?) with the addition of a patch. If you're looking to purchase any of the new #MLB Spring Training caps, they're all up now on the official shop here https://t.co/cYq7cblmkO pic.twitter.com/fvKSBBxo9F — Chris Creamer (@sportslogosnet) February 3, 2017 \nThere was nothing wrong with MLB's on-field hats when they featured only a team's logo, even in the All-Star Game and World Series. This worked for decades. Nobody complained. Nobody thought, \"You know what would make me buy that hat? A giant patch on the side.\" \nBut the annual ridiculousness has been an evolution a long time coming. The changes started innocently enough. For the 1992 season, MLB added its official logo to the back of all on-field caps, which was a fine and appropriate (but still unnecessary) use of a patch. That appeased the Patch Powers for a few years, but then they got antsy again, and disaster followed in 1996. \nThat's when things got out of control with the addition of the modern, giant side patch for the World Series. It's been a hat-tastrophe ever since, with no sign of a return to proper normalcy. Just think, back in the day teams wore the trucker-style snapback hats in spring training. What an uncivilized time that must seem from the perspective of Big Hat. \nAlas, the patches probably aren't going anyway. Every MLB event will have its own hat identity from here to eternity. I suppose people will keep buying them, caring not that each purchase endorses this ugliness. \nBut I'll never stop fighting the good hat fight. To everyone who's with me, I tip my (non-patch) hat in your direction.
