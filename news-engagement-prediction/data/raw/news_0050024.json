Tom Villarin said on Tuesday, commenting on Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar’s report on Monday that Senate reporters were offered $1,000 (P50,250) to cover a news conference where a retired police officer linked     when he was mayor of the city. \nWhite House senior counsel Kellyanne Conway coined “alternative facts” to defend an erroneous crowd estimate during President Donald Trump’s inauguration last month.

Source: Meralco \nAlbay Rep. Edcel Lagman said Andanar “must be either dreaming or having a nightmare” when he claimed in a television interview on Monday that he had received information about the opposition’s attempt to bribe Senate reporters to cover   news conference. \n“I don’t know whether the statement of Andanar has factual basis,” Lagman said. \nSen. Vicente Sotto III said he believed Andanar got his information from Manila Electric Co. \n“Maliwanag nakuryente siya,” Sotto said, using the Filipino term for “bum steer.” \nThe Senate reporters issued a collective statement challenging Andanar to prove his allegation and demanding an apology for putting their and their news organizations’ integrity under a cloud. \nAndanar, a former TV5 news reader, refused to apologize, insisting he got his information from “intelligence reports.” \nHe also flared up at Inquirer reporter Marlon Ramos when pressed on the basis of his claim that there was a plot to unseat Mr. Duterte. \nAndanar   Monday that Lascañas’ admission of killing for Mr. Duterte for pay was “part of a protracted political drama” aimed at toppling Mr. Duterte from power. \nSpeaking at a news briefing in Malacañang on Tuesday, the official reiterated his statement in his television interview that there was nothing in the intelligence report that said any Senate reporters accepted money to cover Lascañas’ press conference. \n“That proves that the reporters at the Senate are good reporters and they stuck to their journalistic integrity,” he said. Losing his cool \nAndanar said he had verified the information, but did not explain why the bribe offered to the reporters was in dollars and not pesos. \nAndanar lost his cool when Ramos asked him about the basis of his statement that there was a plot to bring down Mr. Duterte when National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon and Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana had already dismissed such claims. \nHe retorted that there was classified information and reports that did not reach everyone in the government. He said, however, that he would ask Cabinet members who had received the report if he could release details from it. \nRamos asked him if it was possible that sensitive information like a plot against the President could have failed to reach the national security adviser. Andanar replied, “Don’t pit us against each other, Marlon.” \nHe went on: “Again, you will write something and you say this was what Andanar said. We in the Cabinet have information we receive which we share because we’re open, we’re very transparent.” \nRamos replied that he was just asking for clarification, but Andanar insisted that the reporter was trying to create conflict between him and other officials. “Don’t do that,” Andanar said. \nRamos told Andanar that as a former journalist, he should know when a reporter was seeking clarification. \nAndanar countered: “Let me ask you: Are you fair [in] everything you write?” \nRamos replied in the affirmative. \n“How about your posts on social media?” Andanar asked. \nRamos said those were his personal views. \nBut Andanar had more to say. “As a reporter, you are an ambassador of your newspaper,” he said. \nAndanar writes a column in the Inquirer. — WITH A REPORT FROM CHRISTINE O.
