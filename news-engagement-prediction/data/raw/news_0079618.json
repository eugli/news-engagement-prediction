Photo: Steve Zammit Lupi \nPedestrians are up in arms about fencing that was erected at the crossing point on the Birkirkara bypass, which had been used by students on a daily basis. \nThe fence was erected by the transport authority to discourage people from crossing the busy junction. Many students who parked their cars in Swatar tended to cross the road, despite there not being any zebra crossings. \nIn a statement, the Bicycle Advocacy Group chastised the government for installing fencing that discouraged people from walking instead of making use of private cars. \n“It is time the minister and Transport Malta to actually walk the talk on active transport rather than build fences,” the Group said. The fencing has become a symbol of the ministry’s poor failure to deal with effective pedestrian provision \nIt also called for a pedestrian crossing point to be installed instead, which the group said would not only help students from Swatar and Birkirkara who walk to University, but also those who drive and have to leave their cars in Swatar due to the University’s “chronic parking problem”. \n“The fencing, reminiscent of that placed on the central strip in Mrieħel has become a symbol of the ministry’s poor response and failure to deal with effective pedestrian provision. “The proposed bridge at Mrieħel is still not built and even here a pelican crossing would have been a simpler and cost effective solution,” the group’s spokesman, James Wightman, said. \nUniversity students also expressed their concern at the fence’s installation, with many saying they would not be making use of the subway as indicated on a sign erected by the fence. \nReacting on social media, students said that they did not think the subway was safe, especially when it gets dark and they would instead have to make use of their cars or find alternative parking solution. « Three cockfighters admit to animal cruelty charges Pedestrian hit by vehicle in St Julian's » Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=12821317603&n=87ab4f33' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=12821317603&n=87ab4f33' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
