Foran cleared to play in 2017 3:47 \nWarriors chief Jim Doyle said on Wednesday that, with his immediate future settled, Foran was keen to stay in Auckland. \nBut the club would wait until Foran had successfully bedded into the Warriors set-up before discussing an extension. \n“Kieran doesn’t see himself as a player who hops from club to club, you’ve seen that at Manly,” Doyle said. \n“We’ve had a few discussions around that already but we’ve said, let’s take it one step at a time, get the registration, get on the field.” \nDoyle also said that any contract extension would be dependent on the still-unknown size of the salary cap from 2018. \nThe current $7m cap is predicted to rise in line with a new broadcast deal, but a collective bargaining agreement has not yet been nailed down. \n“You can only spend X amount of dollars or link things to percentages, so it does make it a little bit muddy,” Doyle said. Scott 'stoked' for Foran 1:52 \nIrrespective of any extension, Doyle said he was glad to see Foran get his life back together in Auckland after a difficult 12 months. \nHe had surrounded himself with good people in Auckland, including godfather Don Mackinnon and was almost fully recovered from a serious shoulder injury. \n“This process is not just about ticking boxes for the NRL,” Doyle said. \n“He wants to be a good family man, he’s got two young kids and he’s doing this to better himself, to be the best person he can.” \nDo you live in Queensland?
