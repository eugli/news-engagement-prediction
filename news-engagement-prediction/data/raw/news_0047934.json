But what’s up with vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire? Even a sex therapist was surprised by these... “When I first started experiencing symptoms of vaginal atrophy, it was very distressing,” says Suzanne Days, 64, of The Villages, Fla. “I had lost sexual sensitivity, enthusiasm and my vaginal health,” she says. “Sex didn’t feel like it used to.” That changed the night Days and her husband saw a medical news item on TV. “The doctor on TV said, ‘Women are the most underdiagnosed population with vaginal and sexual health problems, and it doesn’t have to be this way,’ ” Days says. “This made me so hopeful!” So she made an appointment with the doctor featured on the newscast, Irwin Goldstein, MD, director of San Diego Sexual Medicine and a clinical professor of surgery at University of California, San Diego. H ot flashes and night sweats are expected and common symptoms of menopause. But what’s up with vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire? Even a sex therapist was surprised by these... Dr. Goldstein told Days she had vaginal atrophy (VA), also known as genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Symptoms include vaginal burning, itching, painful sex, low desire and urinary problems. VA, caused by low estrogen, affects as many as 45% of postmenopausal women, according to the North American Menopause Society. “I had never heard of the condition before, but knew that I had an answer now and that I would no longer struggle with it,” Days says. Read on to learn how Days vanquished VA by teaming up with her strongest supporters – her husband, her trusted doctor and some good friends. When did you first notice symptoms of VA? I always had a healthy sex life. After I had an ovary removed because of an ovarian cyst when I was 48, my sex drive plummeted to zero. I lost my sensitivity “down there” and I was experiencing dryness during intercourse. H ot flashes and night sweats are expected and common symptoms of menopause. But what’s up with vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire? Even a sex therapist was surprised by these... What did you think was the matter? I knew it was due to a physical problem, because I had a very good and strong relationship with my husband. I also knew it wasn’t normal because I used to work as a sex therapist at a rehab hospital, where I taught stroke victims, quadriplegics and paraplegics how to have relations after injury. So you could say that I knew a lot about sexual function and health. Had you heard of VA before your diagnosis? I had never heard of vaginal atrophy before. I had heard of painful sex, but I didn’t realize that the exterior of the vagina could also change. It’s pretty scary that the skin down there can look so white, like it’s dying. But treatment corrected this and definitely made a difference in my vaginal health. Did you think VA was just a part of getting older? Yes, I thought it might be part of the aging process. H ot flashes and night sweats are expected and common symptoms of menopause. But what’s up with vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire? Even a sex therapist was surprised by these... But I put two and two together and decided that maybe having an ovary removed was causing these symptoms. And it was. It had made my hormone levels drop. How did you talk to your husband about all this? My husband was really understanding about it all. We’ve been married for 43 years and when I met him, it was love at first sight! [But] I [was no longer] initiating sex. I was completely avoiding it, and it was evident to him. Did he take it personally? At first he thought it was personal, but I told him that I just didn’t have any desire anymore and that it was uncomfortable to be together. Did you try to improve your sex drive? I tried lubricants, watching pornography, taking an herb, but they were to no avail. So, I knew I needed to see a professional for help. Was sex painful? I wasn’t having pain during intercourse, but I did have vaginal dryness. I was uncomfortable only if I didn’t use a lubricant during sex. H ot flashes and night sweats are expected and common symptoms of menopause. But what’s up with vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire? Even a sex therapist was surprised by these... So I used one regularly to relieve the dryness. But that didn’t answer my low-interest problems. I’d rather be doing laundry than having sex! It was that much of an aversion. What did your doctor recommend that you do? My primary physician and OB/GYN didn’t really have any advice for me. I was basically told to grin and bear it. After that, I started researching my symptoms. But 15 years ago there wasn’t much information out there on vaginal atrophy. How did you finally get help? I was watching the news with my husband one night, and there was Dr. Goldstein on a medical bulletin. He said that he is dedicating his work to helping women with sexual health problems and dysfunction because they are an underserved population. I looked at my husband and said, “Gee, I’m going to call him tomorrow!” And he said, “Yes! I think that’s a great idea!” H ot flashes and night sweats are expected and common symptoms of menopause. But what’s up with vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire? Even a sex therapist was surprised by these... How did the doctor talk to you about VA? He didn’t just talk to me about it. He showed me. Basically, he took blood work to measure my hormone levels and used two tools, a type of camera and a circular device, to examine me. A nurse stayed in the room while he measured my vaginal sensitivity and used the camera so that I could see how atrophy had affected my vagina’s health. Part of it looked as white as a ghost. He also showed me “before” and “after” photos of atrophied and healthy vaginas so that I could see how treatment works to restore color, sensitivity and the physical condition of the vagina. Did you ever feel embarrassed? Dr. Goldstein has a gift for making people feel completely comfortable talking about their vaginas. Really! It’s like we were chatting about the weather. H ot flashes and night sweats are expected and common symptoms of menopause. But what’s up with vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire? Even a sex therapist was surprised by these... What did he recommend to treat your VA? My doctor first prescribed a mixture of hormones. I was given an estrogen cream that is topical and applied to the exterior of the vagina. The vaginal cream has restored the exterior of my vagina. It makes the lips of the vagina more bulbous and youthful again. I also had low testosterone levels, so I used a topical gel that’s applied to my armpits. I take oral progesterone and estrogen pills, too, but this combination has evolved over time and sometimes needs to be tweaked [because of dropping hormone levels]. What therapies are you on currently? I do the estrogen ring, the cream, and testosterone and progesterone every other day. How long did it take for treatment to take effect? It took four to five months of treatment before I reached what they call “hormone heaven.” I was finally interested [in sex] again and was even initiating it. H ot flashes and night sweats are expected and common symptoms of menopause. But what’s up with vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire? Even a sex therapist was surprised by these... Both my husband and I were relieved. I felt like me again. I could hardly believe it! Are you still experiencing VA symptoms? I am symptom-free now. I have regular appointments with my doctor to manage my condition. Dr. Goldstein has relocated to San Diego now, and I have retired [from Massachusetts] to Florida. Now a girlfriend of mine and I actually make a weekend trip out of seeing him. VA has not put a damper on my quality of life, either. I golf, do water aerobics and my mental status is great. I also have no night sweats or loss of sleep [other symptoms of menopause] since I started this therapy. You mentioned that you talked about VA with your husband. What about with your friends? I’m also pretty open about it with my friends. I was part of a big book club-turned-social club. We talked about different medical stuff, and I brought up my lack of sexual desire and the vaginal changes that I was experiencing. H ot flashes and night sweats are expected and common symptoms of menopause. But what’s up with vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire? Even a sex therapist was surprised by these... I wanted them to know that you don’t have to live like this and that finding the right doctor can transform your life. My friends supported me through this and that was meaningful. Were others encouraged by what you said? One friend confided in me that she was having similar issues and now sees my doctor, too. And when my husband later experienced his own sexual health problems, he was quick to get help because he had seen it work for me! What do you want other women to know about VA? I would tell any of my girlfriends to run, run, run to seek help for this! Just like there are bad mechanics and good ones, you have to find the right doctor who will work with you to ease your symptoms. I also want women to know that they don’t have to struggle with feeling asexual or being uncomfortable “down there.” You deserve a good quality of life.
