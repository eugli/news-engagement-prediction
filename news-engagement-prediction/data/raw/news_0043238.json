(Photo: Representational Image) Islamabad: The much-awaited landmark bill to regulate marriages of minority Hindus in Pakistan is set to become a law with the Senate unanimously passing it.\nThe Hindu Marriage Bill 2017, which is the first elaborate Hindu community's personal law, was adopted by the Senate on Friday.\nThe bill had already been approved by the lower house or the National Assembly on September 26, 2015, and it now just needs signature of the President, a mere formality, to become a law.\nDawn News reported that the bill is widely acceptable to Hindus living in Pakistan because it relates to marriage, registration of marriage, separation and remarriage, with the minimum age of marriage set at 18 years for both boys and girls. The bill will help Hindu women get documentary proof of their marriage.\nIt will be the first personal law for Pakistani Hindus, applicable in Punjab, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces. The Sindh province has already formulated its own Hindu Marriage Law.\nThe bill presented in the Senate by Law Minister Zahid Hamid faced no opposition or objection. It was mainly due to the sympathetic views expressed by the lawmakers of all political parties in the relevant standing committees.\nThe bill was approved by the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights on January 2 with an overwhelming majority. However, Senator Mufti Abdul Sattar of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl had opposed the bill, claiming that the\nConstitution was vast enough to cater to such needs.\nWhile approving the bill, committee chairperson Senator Nasreen Jalil of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement had announced, \"This was unfair not only against the principles of Islam but also a human rights violation that we have not been able to formulate a personal family law for the Hindus of Pakistan.\"\nRamesh Kumar Vankwani, a leading Hindu lawmaker from the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, had been working relentlessly for three years to have a Hindu marriage law in the country.\n\"Such laws will help discourage forced conversions and streamline the Hindu community after the marriage of individuals,\" he said, expressing gratitude to the parliamentarians.\nVankwani also said it was difficult for married Hindu women to prove that they were married, which was one of the key tools for miscreants involved in forced conversion.\nThe law paves the way for a document 'Shadi Parath', similar to the 'Nikahnama' for Muslims to be signed by a pundit and registered with the relevant government department.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:40:05.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
