The four visitors took part in all of the Disney fun, picking up merchandise in one of the theme park's stores, posing for selfies, enjoying the fire works and taking a twirl on the Dumbo ride, of course! However, a source tells E! News she didn't partake in the tea cups. \nWhile the star is expecting her first child with longtime beau Bradley Cooper , the Oscar nominee didn't join the ladies on their trip. Meanwhile, Shayk, who has yet to personally confirm the pregnancy, hid her growing baby bump underneath a coat wrapped around her waist. The 31-year-old beauty seemed to be very persistent about not showing her belly, even posing for a photograph while holding a jumbo stuffed Minnie Mouse in front of her waist.
