Thu, 23/02/2017 - 5:33pm \nThis picture was taken on 23 Feb 2017 @ about 9:20 am along Upp. BT. Timah where the bus-lane is still in operation. \nIs this bike on emergency? Advertisement \nDoes he has the right to parked in a bus-stop or even in d bus-lane at that time? \nIs LTA enforcement warden/s given special previlege? \nIf the above answers are a \"NO\", it goes to show in my opinion, a lack of proper training and lack of supervision. \nI have given umpteen feedback via LTA's hotline and it seems to have fallen on deaf ear. You are policing and yet you condone your men to break d law. It speak so much of LTA. \nPlease do not say that these wardens are beyond your control(most rediculous answer I've gotten when I spoke to your CS); look at the vest they are wearing. I am very disappointed how deteriorated our enforcement agency has become. \nThomas A.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
