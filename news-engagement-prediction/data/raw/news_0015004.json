Night Shyamalan's multiple personality thriller Split led the box office for a third-straight week, a fairly unprecedented streak for a low-budget horror film. \nAccording to studio estimates Sunday, Split came out on top again with $14.6 million in North American ticket sales, bringing the release's three-week haul to $98.7 million. The film's run has come in an especially slow period at multiplexes. Hollywood traditionally bypasses Super Bowl weekend due to the game's enormous television audience. Spoilers: The secrets behind M. Night Shyamalan's surprise 'Split' ending \nThe weekend's other horror option, Rings, came in second with an estimated $13 million. The sequel revived the dormant franchise begun with 2002's The Ring. \nThe weekend's other debut, The Space Between Us, fizzled. The movie starring Asa Butterfield as a boy born on Mars made a mere $3.8 million. \nFinal figures are expected Monday. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
