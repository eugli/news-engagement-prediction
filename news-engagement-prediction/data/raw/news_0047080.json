That’s where a Twitter user spotted our first look at Ares, the god of war and . He’s looming in the center of the image below: DC multiverse #wonderwomanmovie action figures. Ares is build-a-figure #ToyFair2017 #tfny pic.twitter.com/mq4ywUEqig February 19, 2017 \nAres definitely looks imposing: hulking armor, massive sword pointing straight at the camera, heavy-looking shield, and of course those bones protruding from his creepy helmet. Take a closer look in these images from Toy Ark : \nPretty ferocious, right? With a look like that, I was thinking the filmmakers must have cast someone huge like Vinnie Jones or Ray Stevenson to play that part, but according to a new report, they ended up going in the complete opposite direction. Batman-News reports that English actor David Thewlis, who you may recognize as Professor Remus Lupin from the Harry Potter movies, has been cast as Ares. \nWe’ve known Thewlis would be a part of this movie since November of 2015 when the full cast list was unveiled, but the specifics of his role have been kept a mystery until now. Thewlis is a great actor, but he’s way scrawnier than those photos indicate this character would be. \nStill, assuming the report is true, he would be a fascinating choice for Ares because I can easily see him playing the part of a petulant, vindictive god looking to wipe out humanity in a jealous rage because of resentment he’s harbored for years. There have been some rumors that Ares would be brought to life using a combination of live action and CG imagery, so perhaps the filmmakers are looking to use CG to pump Thewlis up for the film’s battle sequences. \nDirected by Patty Jenkins and starring Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Lucy Davis, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, Lisa Loven Kongsli, Danny Huston, David Thewlis, and Saïd Taghmaoui, Wonder Woman will open in cinemas on June 2, 2017. \nImages: Toy Ark, Warner Bros.
