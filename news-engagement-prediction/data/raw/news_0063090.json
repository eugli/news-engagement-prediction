FFA cannot continue to dominate unilaterally - that time is gone - but similarly, the clubs must recognize it’s not just all about getting more money. \nSo far as the brouhaha over “banner-gate” goes, well, I think it’s fair to say we’ve worked out some fans aren’t just in this for the football experience. \nIt’s entirely possible the RBB made an honest mistake by creating the offensive banner on Saturday - misjudging the public mood for such “humour.” But they still had every chance to apologize in the ensuing days. Instead, they chose to be confrontational, accusing FFA of pandering to the mainstream media. There are even rumours of threats issued to journalists who dared write about the story. \nPODCAST: Adam Peacock, Simon Hill and Daniel Garb tackle all the big issues in the game - starting with matters on and off the field from the Sydney Derby. \nIn other words, such people have become totally lost in their own self-importance - and have damaged the game, and the club they profess to love, into the bargain. \nThe supreme irony in all of this, is how many of us in football get worked up by the mainstreams insistence on perpetuating the “Sheila’s, Wogs & Poofters” stereotypes. Yet here was a supporter group using homosexuality as the “joke” against one of our own. It was incredibly dumb, and not even remotely funny. \nWe in the football media have to accept some of the blame for the way this has turned out sadly. We have given the RBB lots of oxygen, because many of the things they brought to the A-League were positive developments. But some of those fans now seem to narcissistically believe that the game day experience is all about them. They even refuse to wear Wanderers shirts offered to them by the club - insisting on being “different” with their black tee-shirts. \nAnd yes, persecution complex-ista’s, the Cove aren’t any better for conducting their own version of seat frisbee at the end either. How would they like it if someone came into their house and started ripping up the furniture? Grow up. Banner shocks Arnold's family 2:04 \nOf course the anti-football media has leapt on this bad news story. We’ve had the usual cascade of column inches, featuring the usual dull clichés, written by the usual dull people, most of whom treat football with the same sort of disdain as something they find on the bottom of their shoe. But we cannot keep giving them free hits. \nWestern Sydney Wanderers is a good club, run by good people. It’s entirely understandable they feel indignant in having to apologize for something that is entirely beyond their control. But that’s collective responsibility in a big organization for you. If I were Paul Lederer, I would be picking up the phone to Graham Arnold right now, or organizing a nice friendly photo-shoot to show there is plenty of mutual respect between Sydney’s two major football clubs. To show that they both put the game above their rivalry. Wanderers humbled by Urawa 1:58 \nOtherwise, this issue has the potential to fester, and make the build-up to the next derby a tense and worrisome period. Do the right thing. \nPerhaps most worrying of all this last fortnight, has been the clubs meek capitulation (Brisbane Roar aside) in the Asian Champions League. \nWanderers and Adelaide were well beaten by vastly superior Japanese opposition, both of whom who were still, technically, in pre-season. \nWith a new broadcasting deal with British company, Perform, worth $2billion to be invested in the J-League, Japan is clearly not going to let regional rival, China, steal a march in East Asia. \nThe money will help J-League outfits compete for top stars in the transfer market, but there are also stipulations in the deal, requiring investment in stadiums, and other football infrastructure - the likes of which could catapult Japan even further ahead of countries like Australia. \nThe Japanese believe the quality of foreign player being brought into the J-League has dropped significantly in recent years, and isn’t helping their domestic product, nor their own players develop. It was perhaps no accident therefore, that Urawa played without an import in their starting eleven against the Wanderers. \nBy contrast, the Wanderers included Dimas, Martinez, Jumpei and Borda. With respect to those players, only Martinez can probably be said to really offer something out of the ordinary. The others? There’s an argument to say they are merely keeping Australian players out of a first team jersey. United fall in ACL opener 1:52 \nOne solution could be - as I mentioned last week - to exempt all the foreigners from the salary cap. At least then, we might be able to bring in a little more quality - adding value to the teams, and helping the locals develop. \nLonger-term, as national coach Ange Postecoglou has demanded, more needs to be done to invest in the next generation of players. It would help if we had more teams to provide more opportunities. It would help too, if the business community of Australia stopped wasting money on internationally dead-end sports like AFL and Rugby League. \nBut it would also help if the football community actually worked together, instead of tearing itself apart.
