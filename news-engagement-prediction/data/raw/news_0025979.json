Scott Morrison brings a chunk of coal into parliament \nHadley revealed he was a fan of the “odd stunt myself” during their interview on Monday morning. \n“Were you channelling me at any stage when you got that big hunk of coal and hid it – were you thinking that wasn’t such a bad stunt with the Bible, I’m going to try to do it with coal?” Hadley asked, referencing his attempt to make Morrison swear an oath that he had backed Abbott in the leadership spill. Scott Morrison 'offended' by Hadley's request to swear on Bible he backed Abbott Read more \n“I do all my own work Ray, just like you,” Morrison responded. \nAfter the moment of mutual admiration Morrison told Hadley he was “actually making quite a serious point” about the Labor party’s “demonising” of coal at the expense of their own constituents. \n“We’re not saying that the only thing we should be doing going forward is coal, that wasn’t the point. I mean our policy is all of the above. We have no more a fear of coal than we have a fear of wind, or solar, or wave energy, or pump-hydro, or whatever the option is.” \nMorrison suggested that Labor was not afraid of coal, but of the Australian Greens. “Because that’s what driven them to write off those jobs of those people in their electorates, and they’re basically cheering on the closure of coal-fired power stations.” \nMany on social media refused to share in Hadley and Morrison’s merriment over the coal stunt as large parts of Australia’s east coast sweltered in unprecedented temperatures over the weekend.
