The words 'The Islamic State' were written across the mosque during one of the arson attacks. (Victoria Police) \nGraffiti reading 'The Islamic State' in English and 'The State the Islam' in Arabic was also sprayed on the outside wall of the centre before the fire was lit. \nDetectives have talked to an Arabic interpreter and believe the Arabic graffiti was written by someone with a reasonable understanding of the language and who intended to write 'Islamic State' but made a spelling mistake. \nThe arsonists were all wearing dark clothing and hooded jumpers and the centre was completely destroyed. \nThe first two fires on May 14 and November 25 caused minor damage, police say.
