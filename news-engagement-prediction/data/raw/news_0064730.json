(Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images) \nIf you didn’t have Dustin Johnson at the Genesis Open, don’t sweat it. A fourth-place finish in Playoffs event is worth 540 FedExCup points, 40 more than what he yielded those on board at Riviera. So, remain patient and, of course, hopeful. \nIf you did have DJ plugged in last week, then kudos on your timing. With the end-weighting of the Playoffs always on the table, and with his proficiency to contend often, you’ll need to withstand his presence among some of your opposition later, but at least you’re better equipped with the windfall on the board. \nAs illustrated in the Comfort Zone on Tuesday, The Honda Classic doesn’t present a stable of automatics inasmuch as it does carefully supported moneymakers. That’s a long-winded way to say that two-man gamers won’t have a problem generating a lineup. From Luke Donald to Graeme McDowell to Jason Dufner to Brendan Steele, any combination of those four offer strong possibilities. \nGetting right to my selection, because Steele can’t play the Barracuda Championship due to his eligibility to compete in the concurrent WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, I’ve been open to moving him into a slot where there wasn’t a chalky choice but also when he made sense. PGA National checks both boxes, so Steele is my pick. \nI’ve used the term “bridge” for years to define a tournament in which you just want to survive and advance even when there are notables in play. Defending champion Adam Scott, Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler and Sergio Garcia all deserve placement elsewhere if for no other reason that PGA National is going to beat up everyone in some fashion. However, in addition to Steele, there are intriguing pieces that both bridge us to next week’s WGC in México and offer relatively sneaky bang for the pluck. \nRussell Knox lost in a playoff here in 2014, and then placed T3 the following year. He’s as electric as Steele is stoked right now. Daniel Berger also lost in a playoff in his debut; that was in 2015. He’s a local and gets back on Bermudagrass. (Two-man gamers, if you’re still with me, a Knox-Berger tandem also works.) And Gary Woodland is a curious curveball who, like Steele, would be dandy at the Barracuda, but the bomber is currently 41st in the Official World Golf Ranking and angling at entry into the field at Firestone as well. Give him a look this week instead. \nNumerous internationals are making stateside debuts this week, but they’re handier as the back end of two-man lineups. However, if you’re compelled to burn one as a bridge, Tyrrell Hatton is easily the most compelling.
