(we are not including Rajinikanth in this of course) They are usually at logger heads with each other, even though ironically both stars maintain a harmonious relationship. When it comes Thala and Ilayathalapathy fans, each update is a news by itself. Remember when Vijay’s’ first look of Bairavaa was out? It created big news. And now yesterday, we caught the first look of Ajith’s next. So, we decided to find out, between both the star’s first looks, whose look created the better impression? Whose avatar was the bigger surprise? You can VOTE and tell us too. Also Read: Shah Rukh Khan found Ajith’s first look of Vivegam awesome \nAjith Kumar’s Vivegam – Ajith Kumar is currently working on his 57th project. The team has been shooting across exotic locales for this hi-fi actioner. He plays an interpol officer. The film also stars Akshara Haasan and Kajal Aggarwal, both of whom are working with the Tamil star for the first time. The film went on floors last August, ever since, fans had been eagerly awaiting a first look. A picture form the sets had leaked before that only to show off a very fit Ajith Kumar. That itself had sent fans into a tizzy. But why was the first look taking so long? On 2nd February, 12: 01, we got our answer when the makers released a poster of the shirtless star sporting 6 pack abs and a chiseled physique along with the title. Jaws dropped and how. Fans couldn’t get over Ajith’s transformation which impressed even celebs – Rana Daggubati, Dhanush, Shah Rukh Khan to name a few. Of course, a few Ajith haters hit out at the makers with photoshop allegations, but a twitter user, lashed out all the haters clearly stating that Ajith was really working hard on his body, even though the design on the poster made it seem over the top. \nVijay’s Bairavaa – If there’s one actor, who boasts of a crazy legion of fans, it’s Ilayathalapathy Vijay. When his 60th film – Bairavaa went on floors, fans were eagerly awaiting the first look and title. In fact, the announcement itself started to trend on Twitter. All we knew then was that Vijay starred opposite Keerthy Suresh for the first time and that the film was directed by Bharathan. And much before the date, 5th September, the makers released the first poster and title. Fans were surprised to catch the mass actor in a sauve tux. It was a surprise for all the fans who couldn’t get over his stylish avatar.
