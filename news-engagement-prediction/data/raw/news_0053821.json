After a collection was posted for sale on eBay in March 2015, Rare Pepes have been frequently listed by users on other online marketplaces. Origin \nStarting in October 2014, users on the /r9k/ (robot9000) board on 4chan began referring to original illustrations and photoshops of Pepe the Frog as “Rare Pepes”; sharing the “rare” images of Pepe as if they were trading cards, some of which were posted with watermarks to retain their value (shown below). Spread \nOn March 28th, 2015, an anonymous 4chan user submitted a thread to the /r9k/ [2] board, which confessed to stockpiling “rare Pepe” images in order to “flood the market” and depreciate their value (shown below). \nOn March 31st, a post was submitted to /r9k/ [3] highlighting an Imgur gallery [15] with over 1,200 pictures of Pepe. In the first week, the gallery received more than 260,000 views.

On May 11th, BuzzFeed [6] published an article about Rare Pepes online. On May 18th, YouTuber ayy caramba uploaded a clip from an Israeli television show with fake subtitles discussing a Rare Pepe economic crash (shown below). Online Listings \nIn the coming months, additional postings selling Rare Pepes were postings on eBay, [9] with over 230 active listings as of September 2015. Additionally, ads for Rare Pepe collections were created on Craigslist .

The same day, The Daily Dot [12] published an article about the Craigslist listings. Market Exchange \nIn September 2016, the site RarePepeWallet was created as a database for Rare Pepe images formatted as trading cards, which can be traded using the cryptocurrencies Counterparty or PepeCash. \nIn February 2017, Bitcointalk Forums [15] member American Pegasus purchased a card design titled “My Little Pepe,” featuring an illustration of Wojak riding Pepe the Frog (shown below), for 1 million PepeCash (approximately $3,500 at the time of sale). \nOn February 13th, Twitter user @ActualAdviceBTC tweeted that Pepe would be bigger than Dogecoin, since it can “literally rarify memes” (shown below). On February 21st, The Daily Dot [16] published an article about RarePepeWallet titled “The Rare Pepe economy is real, and there’s serious money behind it.” Various Examples", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:32:40.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
