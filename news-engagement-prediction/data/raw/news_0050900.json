We the people, our movement is the reason why our President of the United State is standing in front of us today. \n“When President Trump promised all those things he was gonna do for us, I knew he was gonna do them for us. \nWhile Huber’s Facebook posts before the rally have led some to suggest the stunt was staged... Gene Huber was staged. Def not a random. Here's his FB page: https://t.co/7GG6OGMiYG Posted from Trump Winery two days ago. pic.twitter.com/SqIQWTMFAz \n... the most interesting details came from an interview he did shortly after his appearance. \n— Andrew Hibbard (@andrewhibbard) February 19, 2017 \nHe said: “President Trump, I want to thank you so much for giving me this opportunity to come on stage like that. \n“Mr President, I’ve been with you for two years, you probably heard this. every single second, every day, I’m with you. \n“I’ve got a six-foot cardboard box of President Trump in my house and I salute that every single day and I pray and I tell him ‘Mr President, I pray for your safety today’. \n“And I’m not lying, I do that every single day to the President but it’s cardboard. Mwah ha ha...” \nThat laugh though... 2) Appeared To Invent A Terrorist Attack \nDuring the same speech Trump returned to one of his favourite topics - the supposed threat posed by immigration . \nHe said: “ You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden . \n“Sweden. Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible.” \nNo incident occurred in Sweden on Friday and the country’s baffled government later asked the US State Department to explain Trump’s comments. \nSince then, Trump has clarified his position, saying he was referring to a Fox News report that ran on Friday about alleged migrant-related crime problems in the country, rather than an incident that had taken place in Sweden the same day. My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017 \nBut it was too late...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:35:50.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
