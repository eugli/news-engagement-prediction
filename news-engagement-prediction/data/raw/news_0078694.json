He will depart for Birmingham, England on Saturday. \nThe 34-year-old was initially thought to be unable to compete in the world's oldest tournament, to be held from March 7 to 12, after he slipped and suffered a medial collateral ligament (MCL) on his left knee last month. \n\"Chong Wei has been given the green light from the National Sports Institute's Sandra Fiedler. \n\"He also went through a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) yesterday and the results were positive,\" said national singles coach Hendrawan. \n\"It will be his first tournament since the World Superseries Finals in Dubai in December but I'm sure he'll go there and give it his best.\" \nChong Wei who won the All-England in 2010, 2011 and 2014, is drawn to meet a qualifier in the first round. \nHe is expected to meet world No. 7 Tian Houwei of China in the quarter-finals with world No. 4 Son Wan-ho of South Korea a potential semi-finals opponent. \nChong Wei was ruled out of the All-England after he fell on the slippery court at the Academy Badminton Malaysia a few weeks ago. \nHe had claimed that Badminton Association of Malaysia technical director Morten Frost did not act quickly enough to his request for the slippery mats to be replaced. \nRelated stories:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:21:21.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
