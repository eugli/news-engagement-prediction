But, I'm pretty sure we're going to get two SDLP candidates in Foyle and the number three I don't think will come into it. But that's just my personal situation.\" \nWhen pressed on the issue of the parties working together despite their different views, Mr Eastwood replied: \"We're all different and we have different perspectives and ideas. \n\"I want to see a United Ireland and Mike Nesbitt doesn't. \n\"That doesn't stop us working together. The system means we actually have to work together, so you can either vote for people who can work together or you vote for parties who have proven time and time again that they can't, and even when they do they don't deliver.\" \nYou can watch the interviews with Mike Nesbitt and Colum Eastwood on the latest episode of Sunday Politics on iPlayer .
