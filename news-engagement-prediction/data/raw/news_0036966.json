Turning out the lights or dimming them will save councils an estimated £21.1million a year. But last night the AA warned that turning off lights on fast roads was putting people in ‘severe danger’. The body said 11 people had been killed either partly or wholly because of street lights being switched off since 2009. AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said: ‘It is absolutely devastating that there are deliberate decisions to turn off street lights despite constant warnings by the AA. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has lambasted the move, saying: 'Turning off thousands of street lights is a product of the Government slashing funding to councils' ‘When you turn off lights you put people in severe danger. They are killer roads if you turn the street lights off on fast roads. ‘We want an inquiry into the 11 people who died because councils made the deliberate decision to turn off street lights when all statistics pointed to those roads being made more dangerous.’ He dismissed claims that councils were turning off lights to reduce carbon emissions, saying that was just a ‘smokescreen’, and said it was about cost-cutting. Mr Bosdet said Exeter residents were told to carry torches when walking to bus stops, adding: ‘In Essex elderly residents said they regarded it is a curfew because they had to get home before midnight before the lights turn out. They said it reminded them of the Blitz.’ Politicians and campaigners said the move was leaving residents in fear of being attacked on dark streets. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: ‘Streets up and down the country are being plunged into darkness because councils are turning off the lights. Street lights ensure that people are safe on our roads and feel safe walking home. ‘Turning off thousands of street lights is a product of the Government slashing funding to councils. This has put local authorities in the position of deciding what’s more important – the safety of someone late at night or funding a meals-on-wheels service or even paying for basic social care.’ A total of 39 councils are turning their lights off completely, 74 are dimming them and 30 are doing a mixture of both A Neighbourhood Watch spokesman said: ‘This is a concern among our members … because of their perception of the impact this has on crime but also because it does not give them the reassurance and it means they have a fear of crime.’ Figures show Lincolnshire is one of the worst-affected areas, with 36,120 of its 66,360 lights turned off at night. The county council dims 14,750 and a further 11,350 are set to be dimmed or switched off in future. The data comes after it emerged millions of households face an inflation-busting rise in council tax. A survey found 94 per cent of local authorities plan to increase the bills by up to 5 per cent in April – the equivalent of an £80 rise for the average property. The same proportion said they also want to put up parking charges and other fees, resulting in residents paying more for home help, swimming pools, school meals, burials, planning advice and garden waste collection. Critics said town halls could avoid the ‘utterly ridiculous’ rise if they stopped hoarding cash and dipped into their huge reserves, which stood at £22.5billion in 2015. Others suggested they could save money by employing fewer chief executives who are paid more than Theresa May’s £150,000 salary. In 2015, there were 537 of them. Kent County Council is converting all its street lights to LEDs, which will be kept on through the night. A spokesman said the process is due to be completed in May.
