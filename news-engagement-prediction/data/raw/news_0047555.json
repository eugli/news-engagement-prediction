Protesters are staging a demonstration at Heathrow airport Credit: PA \nMotorists have been warned of possible delays as the activists block a road and tunnel leading to terminals two and three at the UK's busiest airport. \nOfficers arrested two demonstrators for obstructing a highway, using two cars to block the tunnel, and said they are working with staff at the airport to remove those locked to the third vehicle. \nThe protest group, Rising Up! said they are acting to oppose expansion at the west London airport. A plan to build a third runway at Heathrow was chosen in October as the Government's preferred option for increasing capacity in south-east England An additional 260,000 take-off or landings will be permitted each year from the expanded airport, up from the current cap of 480,000, according to a draft National Policy Statement on aviation released last month A final NPS is expected to be voted on by Parliament in winter 2017/18, following a consultation \nActivist Simon Bramwell described the consultation process as \"illegitimate and undemocratic\". \nThis blockade is our contribution to the consultation: a third runway is a disastrous option that will lead to climate chaos. \nI look upon my niece and nephew, upon the children who will inherit the future we are creating right now, and my conscience tells me to act. – Simon Bramwell, activist \nA contra-flow is in place in the outbound tunnel to facilitate the movement of traffic around the blocked tunnel (which is now empty), but motorists are advised possible delays to their journey as this incident is dealt with. – Met Police \nA spokesman for Heathrow airport added: \nHeathrow supports the right to peaceful protest within the law, but the safety and security of our passengers, aircraft and colleagues together with the smooth running of the operation is paramount. – Heathrow statement ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:31:32.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
