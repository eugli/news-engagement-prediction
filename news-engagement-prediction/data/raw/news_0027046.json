He is also expected to start against Sutton United in the FA Cup fifth round next Monday. \nOspina was also selected ahead of Cech at the start of last season’s Champions League campaign but was quickly dropped following defeats against Dinamo Zagreb and Olympiakos. Wenger also has a selection quandary in midfield tomorrow now that Granit Xhaka will return to the squad after missing the last four domestic games following his red card against Burnley.

One solution would be to play Xhaka alongside both Oxlade-Chamberlain and Francis Coquelin in the centre, although that would mean sacrificing an attacking player. Mesut Ozil’s dip in form has been of concern recently to Wenger , although he is more likely to be deployed in a wider position than dropped completely. \nWenger has stressed to his team the importance of defensive discipline and ensuring that, unlike recent defeats at this stage of the Champions League, the match is not effectively lost before the second leg.

Bayern, though, have won their last 15 Champions League matches at the Allianz Arena. \n“I think defensive discipline is something we have to put back in our minds because it’s something we need desperately,” said Arsenal captain Per Mertesacker. \n“If you want to be at the top, you need discipline. We need to focus on that kind of game where we feel good defensively first, and then from there spread out and find out offensive power.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:58:50.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
