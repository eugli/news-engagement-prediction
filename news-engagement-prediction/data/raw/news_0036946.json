Afinidad-Bernardo (philstar.com)   10:20am Through the years, Antipolo has burgeoned into what former President Benigno Aquino III described as a “highly-urbanized city,” becoming a haven not only for tourists, but for foodies as well. Philstar.com/Efigenio Christopher Toledo IV \nANTIPOLO, Philippines — By the slopes of Sierra Madre Mountains, about 26 kilometers east of Manila, lies Antipolo City, immortalized in a folk song for being arguably the “Pilgrimage Capital of the Philippines.” \nNamed after “tipolo” (breadfruit) trees abundant in the area, Antipolo was once connected to Manila via steam train and the Manila Railroad Company, forerunner of today’s Philippine National Railways. \nHence, from before World War II to the 1990s, when long distance travel was still unpopular and when airfares were still exuberant, Filipinos from Manila would spend the weekend in Antipolo to go to church and pay respects to the Virgin of Antipolo or Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage, which was brought to the city from Mexico in 1626 and has been enshrined in the Antipolo Cathedral. \nBut through the years, Antipolo has burgeoned into what former President Benigno Aquino III described as a “highly-urbanized city,” becoming a haven not only for tourists, but for foodies, as well. Nowadays, motorcyclists come in droves to explore the city and its new dining hotspots. \nFor those looking for a new ritual to accompany their pilgrimage to the city, check out these diners recommended by restaurant search and discovery service Zomato. \nEggs for Breakfast Café Philstar.com/Efigenio Christopher Toledo IV Eggs for Breakfast Café \nVelada Estate, 21 Don Juan Street, Villa Cecilia Subdivision, Lower Antipolo, Mambugan, Lower Antipolo, Rizal \nOffering Asian cuisine in a café setting, Eggs for Breakfast specializes in all-day breakfast composed of soups, salads, omelets, pastas, pancakes, French toasts, cereals, desserts, smoothies, coffee, and tea. \nFor first timers, try French Toast with Berries, Buttermilk Pancakes with Caramelized Bananas, Deconstructed Hashbrown, and new dishes such as Filipino Platter, USDA Prime Angus Ribeye Steak, Seared Tuna Steak, and Grilled Barbecue Porkchop. \nOther specialties include “comfort brunch,” which includes burgers, hash browns, and “Huevos Rancheros” or classic Spanish brunch of Mexican beans with a spicy blend of tomato chili sauce, topped with a cracked egg and served with crispy tortillas. \nFor a truly heavy breakfast, try One Pan Breakfast, the café’s version of a full English breakfast and is actually an entire platter of imported sausages, bacon, beans, tomatoes, roasted potatoes, eggs, and shitake mushrooms. \nAverage spending here is pegged at P500 for two or P250 per person.
