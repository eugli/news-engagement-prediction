Quincy Acy (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:47  47 p.m. ET \nQuincy Acy signed a two-year contract with the Nets, but he didn't forget about his Texas Legends squad. \nUpon inking the NBA deal last month, the forward gave each of his former D-League teammates $250 gift cards, while the team's staff members each received a pair of shoes, according to USA Today Sports . \nMORE: Luke Walton, Magic Johnson finally talk; Lakers great ready 'to grind' \nAcy orginally was given a 10-day contract with the Nets after starting the season with the Legends. He signed his second 10-day contract on Jan. 20, and on Jan. 30 he inked the two-year deal, according to the Nets . \nIt's Quincy's fifth NBA team in five seasons. He was drafted by the Raptors in 2012 and has bounced around to the Mavericks, Kings and Knicks. \nNow that Acy will be making far more in the NBA, he must have been feeling very generous towards his Legends family. \nAccording to D-League rules, most players make between $19,000 and $26,000 per year.
