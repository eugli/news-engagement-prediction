He is turn down because he is not from the North. Nonsense , we must separate ! All hail Methu, the document paper eater ! Abdulmojeed Nojeemdeen \nDasuki is equally from the south I guess? Julius \nYou would think so by reading the nonsense they post daily about efcc/Buhari is not going after the Northerners. You and I know that’s not true. Abdulmojeed Nojeemdeen \nJuli,we both know their antics Na. Here is a post for the wailers,please help me post it to them.They hate the truth,I AM VERY CERTAIN, IF YOU PULL DOWN THIS MAN – PMB; You will replace temporary hardship with permanent suffering. You will create fertile ground for the wicked to regroup. You will lay red carpet to welcome your common enemy. You will lavishly entertain your oppressors. \nI AM CERTAIN, IF YOU PULL DOWN THIS MAN – PMB; You will replace rare honesty with serial falsehood. You will replace integrity with painful impunity. You will relapse into unending regret; And “had we known” end all statements. \nI AM CERTAIN, IF YOU PULL DOWN THIS MAN- PMB; You will be calling for greater recession, To be managed by greediest elements. You will be asking the poor to go to hell. You will be looking at the end of an era. Probably the end of once prosperous nation. \nI AM CERTAIN, IF YOU PULL DOWN THIS MAN – PMB; The Courts and the Judiciary System will privatise itself such that the hope of common man be dashed And justice turns commodity market. The rich alone can bargain, And highest bidder gets the justice. Injunction will then carry price tag, Stay of execution will have price, Adjournment will be bought And common man turn to God or Self. \nI AM CERTAIN, IF YOU PULL DOWN THIS MAN- PMB; You will be asking for poison which is Strong enough to burst the belly And Fast in action to send beyond, Heralding the end of a journey. You will be seeing the last man Passionate about a nation, Thinking less about his passion, and the last generation with compassion And you have good things Exclusive to the richly Corrupt alone. \nI AM CERTAIN, IF YOU PULL DOWN THIS MAN – PMB; I AM CERTAIN ! \nYou will be stopping healing process, And the wound becomes fresher and painful Then healing becomes far fetched As teeth gnashing signal a Long time regret and Generations to come will be greeted with untold hardships. They will vehemently curse you such that the grave will press your ribs- to ribs. Noble \nWhen a man is drowning in river, he may wish to hold a sword to save himself. Abdulmojeed Nojeemdeen \nIs like he wants to go and see buhari in London. Pussy metu, pussy metu,where are you going,I am going to London to see buhariii! Abdulmojeed Nojeemdeen \nOlisa goat,see wetin yam come put you. Abangii,why you dey bang these people with your judgement Na? Julius \nNo mind dem..keep reading their comments.
