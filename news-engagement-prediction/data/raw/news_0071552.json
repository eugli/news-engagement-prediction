The gaffer is a proven winner and we all trust him completely. So short and long term it's about winning trophies for Liverpool.\"\nAdam Lallana: \"I can't think of a better club to commit your future to.\" �� pic.twitter.com/NEMp6dCPxC\n- Liverpool FC (@LFC) February 22, 2017 Lallana initially struggled on Merseyside following his £25 million move from Southampton in the summer of 2014.\nHowever, under Klopp's tutelage, he has thrived in a central-midfield role this season and was recently named England's Player of the Year for 2016.\n\"It took a little time to settle here, but looking back that was down to a variety of factors, such as the team at that stage was in transition and we had a big turnover of players the summer I joined,\" Lallana added.\n\"But I couldn't feel any more at home now and I think that shows on the pitch. The best part of this for me is that I feel I can really contribute in these coming years.\n\"I feel like I'm playing the best football of my career and I feel fresh and ready to perform at this level for a long period of time now. I suppose that's the challenge I have to make to myself. It wasn't a difficult decision to commit longer here. I didn't hesitate for even a second.\n\"We have everything in place here to be successful. We know the manager has committed himself to the club long term, so we have everything in place now. We have stability and ambition -- that's a decent combination.\n\"I genuinely believe we can beat anyone and everyone in this league and do so consistently. It's a good time to be at Liverpool, but as the manager said recently, we are still early in our development so even better times lie ahead.\"\nGlenn is ESPN FC's Liverpool correspondent.
