Tata teases Tiago-based compact sedan Tigor autos Updated: Feb 09, 2017 17:33 IST Hindustan Times, New Delhi Tata Motors teased Tigor, a Tiago-based compact sedan, with a design sketch on Thursday.(Tata Motors) \nTata made two statements on Thursday. First: It’s not Kite 5; it’s Tigor. Second: It’s not a compact sedan; it’s a Styleback. \nYes. Tata Motors just wants to give a new category of its own, to eliminate the need of calling Tigor a successor to Indigo or even Zest. \nTigor (pronounced Tee-gaur) is a fastback derived from Kite 5, the concept showcased at the Delhi Auto Expo 2016 last February. The chemistry of Tigor with Tiago is the same as what Indigo’s was with Indica, or of the Zest with Bolt. Although only a design sketch was revealed on Thursday, the production version of the car may not differ much from the Auto Expo-showcased concept model. The Kite 5 concept as showcased at the 2016 Auto Expo. (Tata Motors) \nAccording to the Tata Motors statement, Tigor will bring a “radical new silhouette to the segment, which is dominated by boxy cars”. \nThe cars may bear the same technicals from the Tiago – the 1.2-litre Revotron petrol and the 1-litre Revotorq diesel engines. Tigor may have more room inside but the dash may not change much. Tigor production version may remain close to the Kite 5 concept. (Tata Motors) \nTata Motors is expected to place Tigor against Ford Figo Aspire, Honda Amaze, Hyundai Xcent and the Maruti Suzuki DZire, in the Rs 5.3-5.5 lakh price bracket. But there’s one Zest already in the compact sedan segment from the Tata stable, costing around Rs 5.4 lakh, which is why Tigor could be a more premium offering from the Indian carmaker. \nBasking in the success of Hexa , the crossover launched last month, Tata may launch Tigor most likely by March. Given Tata Motors’ diminishing market share and the not-so-successful recent models, an aggressive approach like this is the need of the hour.
