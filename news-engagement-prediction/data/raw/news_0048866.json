His teacher told her that the presentation was not allowed because it was proselytizing. \nReferring to one of the videos on Islam, Geyer said, “I call this proselytizing.” \n“When religion coming from the school itself is explored and taught, this is proselytizing,” she added, noting that school district policy prohibits promotion of any religious belief or non-belief in the regular curriculum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:40:23.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
