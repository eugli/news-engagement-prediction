Australian coal 'risks being caught out' by Trump climate U-turn Read more \nThe new report says solar costs have dropped 58% in five years and are expected to continue to fall by a further 40-70% by 2040. \nA Climate Council member and former president of BP Australasia, Greg Bourne, says Australia is currently undergoing a surge in solar, with more than 20 industrial-scale installations going ahead in Australia during 2017 and another 3,700 megawatts in the pipeline. \nShorten will meanwhile use the speech at Bloomberg to try and hit back after weeks of government bombardment about Labor’s energy and climate policies. \nHis intervention follows the publication of this week’s Guardian Essential poll , which found that 65% of voters supported Labor’s 50% renewable energy goal. \nThe new survey underscored broad-based community support in Australia for renewables. It also showed that most people believe recent power blackouts in South Australia are not attributable specifically to a comparatively high share of renewable energy in the state but to failures of the energy market in responding to extreme weather events. \nTurnbull has repeatedly branded Labor’s 50% renewable energy goal as reckless and ideological but the policy won strong majority approval from both Labor and Green voters in the latest Essential survey. Coalition voters were also more likely to approve of the policy than disapprove. \nThe poll suggests the Coalition’s political campaign against Labor’s renewable energy schemes, which has been underway since South Australia was plunged into a statewide blackout last year, hasn’t moved the dial in any significant way. The Essential data suggests attitudes to Labor’s 50% by 2030 policy have changed little since it was unveiled by Shorten in 2015. \nShorten will say on Thursday when it comes to capitalising on jobs in the renewables sector: “Australia has got a dream barrier draw. \n“We are the world’s sunniest continent, one of the windiest places on earth and our universities, research centres and firms keep producing leaders in the field. \n“But, despite the prize on offer, despite all our natural advantages – we’re not just stuck in the gates, we are going backwards. \n“When the Coalition came to office and declared war on the RET scheme, investment in large-scale renewables fell by 88% in one year. After being rated one of the four most attractive destinations in the world for renewable energy investment in 2013, we now don’t even crack the top 10. \n“In the last three years, the world has added nearly 3m jobs in renewable energy and Australia has lost 3,000. If the Liberals had just stuck to the old conservative nostrum of first, do no harm, if they’d done nothing but keep pace with the global trend, we would have added 7600 jobs.

He will argue a trading scheme for the electricity sector will drive investment not only in renewables but in gas. \n“Because gas produces roughly half the pollution generated by burning coal – an EIS will inevitably make gas a more attractive investment.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:23:10.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
