Read More LIVE: Storm Doris hits Greater Manchester with heavy rain and 80mph winds forecast \nAccording to forecasters, the storm \"rapidly deepened\" this morning and underwent \"explosive cyclogenisis\". \nThis process happens when dry air flows quickly into an area of low pressure. It creates a more vigorous storm, or weather bomb, as the air within the depression rises very rapidly, increases its rotation and intensifies the pressure. \nMeteorologists say to be classed as a weather bomb, the central pressure of the storm system must dip by 24 millibars in a 24-hour period. \nStorm Doris has fulfilled this criteria, meaning it is now a weather bomb.
