This year, he is averaging 7.0 points and 4.4 rebounds for the Suns. He is a free agent after this season. \nChandler is averaging 15.6 points and 6.7 rebounds this year in Denver, where he has been since 2010-11. The 29-year-old is under contract for $12 million next season and holds and $12.8 million player option for 2018-19. \nThe clock is ticking on the Raptors.
