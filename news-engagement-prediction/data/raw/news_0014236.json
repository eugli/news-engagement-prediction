However, RBI has cut repo by 1.75 per cent since January 2015. \n\nAccording to industry body Ficci, the RBI is likely to maintain status quo in the upcoming monetary policy meet and cut rates in the first half of fiscal year 2017-18. \n\nThe MPC has been mandated to maintain retail inflation at 4 per cent (with plus/minus 2 per cent range) till 2021. \n\nRising for the fifth straight month, retail inflation or CPI quickened to 5.61 per cent in December, mainly on costlier vegetables and cereals, limiting the headroom for the RBI to lower rates. \n\nHowever, WPI or wholesale inflation fell in December but the rate of decline at 0.73 per cent was the slowest in last one year as food prices shot up, indicating return of inflationary pressures. \n\nSome bankers, however, expect RBI to cut benchmark lending rate by 0.25 per cent as macroeconomic indicators are favourable for an easy monetary policy stance. \n\n\"We are expecting 25 basis point cut in repo rate because macro economic factors like inflation, fiscal deficit are conducive for reduction. Given the growth oriented budget , there is widespread speculation that RBI would respond in the same spirit,\" Bank of Maharashtra Executive Director R K Gupta told PTI. \n\nThere are expectations of 25 basis point rate cut as there is excess liquidity in the system, UCO Bank MD CEO R K Takkar said.
