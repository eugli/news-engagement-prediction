Jesse Jackson Jr. 's divorce case show how he has been able to collect hefty benefit checks from the federal government after serving time in prison for looting hundreds of thousands of dollars from his campaign fund. \nJackson, 51, receives about $138,400 a year — more... (Katherine Skiba) \nMany Americans go through messy divorces. Some suffer bipolar disorder. But they don't loot their campaign funds and buy stupid elk heads and other junk with money that's not theirs and then sit back and draw $138K on the taxpayer's dime. \nNice one, Triple J. Who's your daddy? \nThe other slap involved Emanuel's decision to reinstate Redflex, the notorious red light camera company that made millions catching drivers going through red lights. The firm had bribed and schemed its way into City Hall . The CEO was convicted, along with two others, including former city official John Bills, political lickspittle of Illinois Democratic boss and House Speaker Michael J. Madigan. \nRedflex settled, recently paid the city $20 million, and Emanuel's government reinstated the company, allowing it to bid on future city contracts. The Tribune's David Kidwell, who has done great investigative work on Redflex, wrote the story. Rahm Emanuel 's administration has reinstated the red light camera vendor it fired after the firm was caught bribing its way into City Hall , making Redflex Traffic Systems Inc. once again eligible to pursue city contracts following a four-year suspension.\nThe designation of Redflex as a \"responsible... \nMayor Rahm Emanuel 's administration has reinstated the red light camera vendor it fired after the firm was caught bribing its way into City Hall , making Redflex Traffic Systems Inc. once again eligible to pursue city contracts following a four-year suspension. \nThe designation of Redflex as a \"responsible... (David Kidwell) \nI called the mayor's office, convinced this was a mistake. Rahm was too smart to do something as idiotic as absolving a crooked company while trying to rebuild his battered image. \nI was wrong. \nThe city's Law Department tells me that since \"this misconduct was uncovered\" — they forgot to mention Kidwell uncovered it — \"the company has cooperated with all investigations\" and has purged itself of executives who participated in the schemes. \nOh, happy days. But that's angels-on-the-heads-of-pins lawyerly gobbledygook. \nRedflex was involved in corruption and bribery. Now the mayor lets it back in line? Who is Rahm, just another tiny, 9.5-fingered version of a Daley? He could have told the company to take a walk. But instead, he gave it a lawyer's version of a wet kiss. \nA mayoral spokesman assured me that if Redflex ever did bid and \"hypothetically win a city contract in the future,\" the company would undergo \"great scrutiny.\" \nI felt sorry for the spokesman. Rahm is the boss. So he should scrooten the next few paragraphs. \nIf there's one elected official who can put the mayor's Redflex reinstatement in proper context, it's Ald. Scott Waguespack , 32nd, the liberal Democrat and honest reformer. \n\"Crime pays? I don't think you're too far off,\" Waguespack said. \"It's tone-deaf. You look at this and think, 'What's in your core to think in any way that reinstating Redflex is a good idea?' He didn't have to let them back in, but he did. \n\"Why does he make this decision? I don't get it. He fired them (Redflex), he draws a red line, and then he brings them back in and tells them to get in line? It's not only bad policy, it looks bad to the people of the city.\" \nLike other odd Rahmian initiatives, including steamrolling the City Council to support Uber — his brother Ari is reportedly a major investor — the mayor's Redflex absolution smells. And not like Grandma's lavender powder-room candles that she never lights. \n\"It's as if there's a wall with the people on one side, and Rahm and these companies on the other,\" Waguespack said. \"It leads to an erosion of trust, not only in him, but in the institution of government. \n\"And it erodes confidence, and the people ask, 'Where are we going? What kind of city is this?'\" \nWhere are we going? What kind of city is this? \nThe city is broke, the schools are in chaos, Emanuel's working his cops to the bone, he doesn't have a real plan to deal with the gang wars and summer's coming. I appreciate Rahm's wicked wit and drive, and I know he inherited a mess at City Hall. But after he reinstated Redflex, I wonder about the guy. \nIs he running the city, or merely running for office? Or is somebody running him? \nAnd Waguespack asks, \"What kind of city is this?\" \nI'll tell you. It's the city that isn't smart enough to elect a man like Scott Waguespack to the fifth floor of City Hall. That's the kind of city this is. \nIt's the city where the mayor can send out his spinners to discuss how he's rehabilitating his image before the re-election campaign, defend Chicago as a \"sanctuary city\" to scoop up the Latino vote, and reinstate Redflex. \nIt's also the city where Jesse Jackson Jr. — a political princeling — can pull in all that cash and sit on his porch with a cigar, as Chumbolone Nation pays taxes and gets zip. \nChicago should hold a parade in their honor, Triple J on a float, pulled by a Lexus fitted with elk heads and horns, his daddy with a bullhorn shouting \"I am somebody!\" and \"Keep hope alive!\" and Rahm perched on a Redflex camera, throwing fake Redflex refund coupons to the crowds. \nThey wave and shout, \"Your parents were wrong! Crime does pay!\" \nAnd chumbolones? You're paying. \nListen to \"The Chicago Way \" — radio free Chicago in podcast form — with John Kass and Jeff Carlin at http://wgnradio.com/category/wgn-plus/category/thechicagoway . \nTwitter @John_Kass", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:51:40.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
