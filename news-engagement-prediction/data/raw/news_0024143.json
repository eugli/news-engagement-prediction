Paneerselvam. \nA. Navanaeethakrishnan, AIADMK floor leader in the Rajya Sabha, told The Hindu that Chinamma (Ms. Sasikala) had the support of all legislators in Tamil Nadu and all parliamentarians were also with her. \n“Since Chinamma has unwarranted support of all MLAs, the Governor should not delay the swearing-in ceremony. The budget has to be cleared, drought condition is prevailing, there are other pressing issues also, which require attention,” Mr. Navaneethakrishnan said during an interaction at Parliament House. \nHe said the delay by Governor in appointing Ms. Sasikala as the Chief Minister was “unconstitutional” and “impermissible under law”. \nHe added that Mr. Paneerselvam was a “selfish man”. \n“On Sunday when the AIADMK leaders met and chose Ms. Sasikala to lead the party and the State, it was Mr. Paneerselvam who fell down at her feet. He touched her feet in front of everyone. And now he says that he was forced to resign?” Mr. Navaneethakrishnan said. \nOn Thursday, Mr. Navaneethakrishnan mentioned the absence of Governor Ch. Vidyasagar Rao during zero hour discussions in Rajya Sabha. \n“The AIADMK MPs also trooped into the well of the House in order to save democracy. The swearing-in ceremony should be conducted today itself,” he said. \nAnother MP said that Mr. Paneerselvam was acting as a “puppet” as DMK, the main opposition party in the State, has said that it will support him. \nThe MP, however, refused to blame the BJP government at Centre for stoking the rebellion by Mr. Paneerselvam and said that even the late M.G Ramachandran never antagonised the Centre. \n“The original plan was to parade the MLAs before the President of India, but when media reports came in that Governor would be in Chennai, the plan was dropped. Even the Raj Bhavan had no information about the arrival of the Governor, we got to know from media,” the MP said. \nThe AIADMK has 13 MPs in Rajya Sabha (including rebel Sasikala Pushpa) and 37 in Lok Sabha. None of the members were present in Parliament till Wednesday when the drama unfolded in Tamil Nadu. On Thursday they were in full attendance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T13:27:45.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
