It was a bad night for Labour, too, as Jeremy Corbyn’s party barely hung on to Stoke but lost its seat in Copeland. Read more UKIP chairmen resign over leader’s ‘insensitive’ approach to Hillsborough \nNuttall lost his bid for a parliamentary seat in Stoke-on-Trent Central, where, despite the city’s near 70 percent vote in favor of Brexit, euroskeptic UKIP limped over the finish line behind Labour by 12 points. \n“This city will not allow ourselves to be defined by last year’s referendum. And we will not allow ourselves to be divided by the result,” Labour’s new Stoke MP Gareth Snell said in his victory speech. \n“For those who have come to Stoke-on-Trent to sow hatred and division, and to try to turn us away from our friends and neighbours, I have one message – you have failed. \n“Tonight the people of Stoke-on-Trent have chosen the politics of hope over the politics of fear. We have said with one voice that hatred and bigotry are not welcome here.” \nThe abysmal result for UKIP came as a surprise, as commentators expected Britain’s new “third party” to do better in a constituency like Stoke. \n“If you want to be an electoral force and a political force in this country you have to be able to win by-elections in difficult circumstances as a third party,” Manchester University politics professor Rob Ford told Reuters . \n“If they can’t do that even in the most propitious of seats people will start to have questions.” Nigel Farage said that winning in Stoke-on-Trent Central was “fundamental” to the future of UKIP.

Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell labelled the result “really disappointing.” \nBoth constituencies called by-elections when their serving Labour MPs resigned under Corbyn’s leadership, opting instead for well paid jobs outside politics.
