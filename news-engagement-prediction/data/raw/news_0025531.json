Supplied \nMaggie Cadzow after her first surgery for her tetralogy of fallot heart defects. Damage during this surgery meant she needed a pacemaker. \nOne out of 12 babies born every week in New Zealand has a congenital heart defect. \nMaggie has undergone multiple surgeries and is on her third pacemaker, but she's not letting that hold her back. \n\"She is pretty gutsy. She likes to tell people she has a special heart,\" Maggie's mother Belinda Cadzow said. David Unwin/Fairfax NZ \nMaggie Cadzow won't let her pacemaker slow down her love of singing and dancing. \nMaggie was born with tetralogy of fallot – four defects, including holes in the heart, blockages in the arteries and muscle being too thick around one chamber. \n\"She was our first born. I just thought the world was coming to an end. We did not know what was going to happen,\" Belinda Cadzow said. \n\"Once you get to places like Starship [children's hospital] and Ronald McDonald House, you see what other families have to deal with. You see in the scheme of things we were lucky. It is lucky she can have a normal life.\" \nBelinda Cadzow said she and her husband found out about their daughter's condition at her 20 week scan. \nShe was grateful it was picked up early \nAt 4-months-old, Maggie had to endure a seven-hour open-heart operation. \nHowever, the surgery damaged her AV node, responsible for the electrical impulses in her heart. \nBelinda Cadzow said they had been told there was only a 1 per cent chance of an accident, but she did not feel hard done by. \n\"That is one of the risks you run when you have that surgery.\" \nThe damage meant Maggie had to get a pacemaker. \n\"If she did not have that she would have to sleep 23 out of 24 hours. \n\"The pacemaker gives her a normal life. \n\"We got used to it. It is just the norm now.\" \nBelinda Cadzow said they had to be careful about infections and being around magnets or electric fences. \nMaggie will need more surgeries in the future – one to replace the wires of her pacemaker, another to change the battery, and one to replace her pulmonary artery. \nShe also gets checks every year to make sure everything is running as it should. \nBelinda Cadzow said she had amazing support from Heart Children, Starship Hospital, Ronald McDonald House and her employers at the Fire Service. \n\"Everyone has been pretty amazing and has rallied around.\" \nMaggie enjoys playing netball and walking, but most of all she likes singing and dancing. \n\"I started when I was little. I have always loved to perform. I put on shows,\" Maggie said. \nShe felt nervous before the surgeries, but did not otherwise notice her pacemaker. \nEvery year in New Zealand, about 450 open heart surgeries are performed on children or babies. \nHeart Kids receive no government funding for the services we provide. The organisation is reliant on the generosity of the New Zealand public. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:43:30.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
