The past few days have been rough for the Batman franchise considering Ben Affleck exited the hero’s standalone film as a director. Understandably, fans have felt conflicted about Batman’s future in the DC Extended Universe, but a special throwback from a Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice crew is distracting fans from that fate. On Instagram, one of the production designers from the blockbuster posted some creepy concept art from the movie’s nightmare scene.

Fabrication/ makeup /application,Steve Wang -Thomas Floutz,” Patrick Tatopoulous captioned his work online. \nThe dark, gritty image is definitely one that would give anyone a nightmare. Fans can see the back of Affleck’s Bruce Wayne cowering as a devilish creature towers over him. The bald creature looks gruesome with his pointed nose and cloudy eyes. And, of course, fingers are adorned with insanely sharp, long nails. \nFearing the actions of a god-like Super Hero left unchecked, Gotham City’s own formidable, forceful vigilante takes on Metropolis’s most revered, modern-day savior, while the world wrestles with what sort of hero it really needs. And with Batman and Superman at war with one another, a new threat quickly arises, putting mankind in greater danger than it’s ever known before.
