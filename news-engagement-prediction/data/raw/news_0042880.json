Chelsea ran out comfortable 2-0 winner at Wolves Credit: Rex Features \n“I’d sign now for this. Now I’d sign,” he said, smiling and signing in the air with a flourish. \n“The most important thing is now, the present, to work and build a good future. Then, yes, for sure we will see the situation of every single player and we try to make the best decision for every single player. \n“I’m pleased to give him the opportunity to play but not because there is a sentiment. \n“I think John Terry deserved to play this game and he played very well, I’m very happy for him. For me, he’s a very important player, my captain and he’s important on and off the pitch. He’s helping me a lot, and I’m very pleased to have him in my squad and also to know this type of person.” \nT erry will consider his next move at the end of the season and Chelsea do not expect to address the situation until May. Conte was pleased with his captain's performance Credit: Rex Features \nH e is not ready to retire just yet, despite taking his coaching badges, but has always dismissed the idea of playing for another Premier League club. Bournemouth made an attempt to sign him on loan in January and did not receive any encouragement. \nAsmir Begovic, the goalkeeper, said: “He trains like he always has. What he’s got in his mind is only something he can answer. \n“I can see him continuing to play and I don’t see why he should quit but maybe if he lifts two trophies that’s a great way to go out as well.” FA Cup quarter-final draw \nC helsea have not won the double since Carlo Ancelotti’s time at the club and will be difficult to stop this season. Conte made seven changes at Molineux yet this was still another ruthlessly efficient performance. \nWolves produced an energetic, vibrant first-half performance which unsettled the Premier League leaders with George Saville, the former Chelsea midfielder, striking the post early on. \nYet Wolves struggled to match that intensity in the second period and Chelsea exploited the gaps to ensure they did not join Liverpool and Stoke in the list of Paul Lambert’s victims.

All we need to do now is take it on to the league.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:41:26.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
