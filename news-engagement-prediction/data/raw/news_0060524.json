Kusu members get between Sh17,013 and Sh27,222 in house allowances. \nSRC further said the minimum salary for the lowest paid employee must comply with the minimum wage bill. \nA calculation by vice chancellors of public universities seen by The Standard shows the lowest paid member of the teaching staff – an assistant lecturer– will earn Sh91,593 and professors up to Sh240,491 per month if they accept the Government offer. \nThe dons took to the streets from the University of Nairobi's graduation square and marched to Jogoo House, the Ministry of Education headquarters, to submit a memorandum on the CBA to Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i. \nLecturers and officials from Technical University of Kenya, Karatina University, Kenyatta University, Multimedia University, Kisii University and University of Nairobi joined the protests in Nairobi. \nThe lecturers accused the Government of ignoring them while increasing salaries of civil servants. \nUasu vice chairman Joseph Mberia accused IPUCCF of lacking good will in talks to end the strike. \"They gave a verbal offer from which Sh4.2 billion will go to pension. The remainder was to be shared among the three unions, to cater for 30,000 members. This is a shame.\" \nALSO READ: Mediocrity creeping into varsities, warns Prof Bethwel Ogot \nHe said they were waiting for a written counter offer that was to be submitted yesterday. \"I only want Sh17 billion for Uasu members and I will call off the strike,\" said Mberia. \nIt also emerged talks to end the strike may collapse after Dr Matiang'i reportedly left it to university councils to handle the matter. \nIPUCCF boss P Kanyari said action will be taken against the striking workers. \"It has become necessary that respective university councils and managements take immediate steps to invoke their employment policies and guidelines on disciplinary measures directed at any staff members willingly participating in the illegal strike,\" Prof Kanyari said.
