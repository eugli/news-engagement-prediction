Three soldiers have been captured. \n\"I have lost many soldiers in just 48 hours, I think to continue with the ceasefire does not or will not produce anything,\" Duterte said in a speech. \n\"I am asking the soldiers: Go back to your camps, clean your rifles and be ready to fight.\" \nDuterte's declaration follows his defence minister's assurance on Wednesday that the government would stick to a unilateral truce. \nThe communists accused the military of occupying 500 barrios, or town districts, that are supposedly within their control. \nThe rebels said government troops engaged in \"hostile actions\", but they still supported the peace process. \nThe military responded by saying the NPA had broken the ceasefire numerous times. It was due to expire on Feb 10. \n\"I'm really very sorry. I tried my best but like in the song, my best was not good enough,\" Duterte said. \n\"There will be no peace in this land vis-a-vis the Communist Party. Let's resume the war.\" \nHe said the rebels' demands were \"too huge\" and it was impossible to work out a compromise. He felt he had shown his commitment to the process by freeing top communist leaders. \n\"I am sad to report to you that there will be no peace with the communists for the next generation\", he said. \n- Reuters \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T11:38:04.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
