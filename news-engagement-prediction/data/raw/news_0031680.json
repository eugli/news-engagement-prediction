You are our light, and the way that you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel is empowering, and you make them stand up for themselves. I love you, and I always will.” \nAdele also received Song Of The Year and Record Of The Year for her chart-topping single ‘Hello’, also giving a shout out to the Queen Bey during her acceptance speech for the latter. CBS ﻿Beyoncé was visibly moved by Adele's words \nThis year, Beyoncé received more nominations than any other artist with a staggering nine nods, as well as giving an elaborate performance during the ceremony. \nMeanwhile, Adele also performed not once but twice, first opening the show with ‘Hello’ and later paying tribute to George Michael with a rendition of his track, ‘Fastlove’. \nHowever, her second performance was not a smooth one, and she was forced to restart the song after suffering technical difficulties . \nOther big winners on the night included Chance The Rapper and Drake. \nAdele previously won Album Of The Year for ‘21’ back in 2013, while this marks Beyoncé’s third nomination in the category.
