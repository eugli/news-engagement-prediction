Six-time Grammy award-winner Lady Gaga will headline the event, and the only guest that has been confirmed is Tony Bennett, who will appear in a short video leading up to Gaga’s first song. Lady Gaga is one of the most popular artists in the world, and she’s ready to take stage. Gaga has stated that she’s been planning to perform in a Super Bowl halftime show since she was just 4 years old. “For me, it’s all about giving to the fans and bringing people together that wouldn’t normally come together,” Gaga said. Many have speculated Gaga will perform her hit “Bad Romance,” as the behind-the-scenes video posted by Pepsi reveals her and her backup dancers practicing dance moves for the song. This will be Lady Gaga’s first appearance in a Super Bowl halftime show, but it will be the second consecutive year she’s performed at the big game. Last year, she sang the national anthem and knocked it out of the park. Coldplay headlined the halftime show a year ago, with both Beyonce and Bruno Mars also taking the stage in Santa Clara. This past November, Lady Gaga just hit No. 1 on the Billboard Top 100 Chart for the first time, when her new album Joanne debuted at atop the list. Now seems like a great time for the superstar to take center stage. And whether you love her or you don’t, it’s refreshing to see an icon so excited to participate in the big game, even though she’s already kind of been there before. If you're currently watching the Super Bowl on FOX, you can keep it tuned in there to see the halftime festivities. If you're by your computer, you can stream the show for free on FOX Sports Go.
