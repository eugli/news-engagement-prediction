She said she was raped. \nThe complainant told Crown prosecutor Jacinda Foster that she was so intoxicated, she could not remember parts of her night, specifically being in town with Kuggeleijn. \n\"[The] defendant kept pulling down my underwear, I said stop, no, and I had to pull it up,\" the complainant said. \n\"I had to tell him, no, no, stop ... I said no dozens of times.\" \n\"I couldn't hold my underwear up any longer. He got on top and tried to penetrate me, I tried to push him off... I remember thinking, I'm in trouble ... staring at the ceiling wanting it to be over.\" \nKuggeleijn's evidence was that she wanted it to happen and \"seemed to like it\". \n\"I did not force myself on her like she said,\" Kuggeleijn said during the trial, \"She is lying, yes.\" \nWilson said in his instruction to the jury on Friday morning, that \"consent means true consent given by a person that can make a rational decision. \n\"Consent given reluctantly or later regretted is still consent.\" \nAnd it's cases of sexual violation where the word consent is often difficult for the courts to work through, said University of Waikato law lecturer Brenda Midson. \n\"What the law requires for there to be consent is that it is truly voluntary, so they're aware of what they're consenting to, they know what they're consenting to and that their consent is freely given,\" Midson said. \n\"But what the Crimes Act says in terms of sexual offences is that it is not consent if the person is forced into it. Not consent when they are asleep or unconscious. \n\"In some cases, fear of force may negate consent, so a fear to say no.\" \nBasically, Midson says, nothing in the Crimes Act says the definition of consent is exclusive. \n\"In every single case, it's a question of fact - whether or not the complainant consented,\" she said. \n\"Just because there was no force does not mean the woman consented, for example.\" \nMidson said the categories are a question of fact and, with a trial, it can also be open to bias and prejudice. \n\"What the law tried to do was make it clearer for juries to understand that just because somebody acquiesced doesn't mean that it was consent,\" she said. \n\"The court has to be satisfied that the complainant actually did consent and that their will wasn't overborne by somebody else. \n\"But that's only one step in relation to sexual offending - that question of consent.\" \nThe second step is whether or not the defendant had, beyond a reasonable doubt, the belief there was consent. \n\"The accused has to believe - for him not to be liable - he must believe on reasonable grounds that she consenting,\" Midson says. \n\"So you can see why it is really hard for courts to work through these issues.\" \nMidson said the law has come a long way because, previously, if the defendant could argue he believed a complainant was consenting, regardless of whether it was reasonable or not, even an unreasonable belief was enough for an acquittal. \n\"Then again, it comes down to the prejudices held by the jury and what they would think was reasonable and that could be problematic. \n\"This is why a lot of complainants don't actually come forward - because why would you put yourself through it because that response or the defence is a very common one: I believed she was consenting.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:57:57.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
