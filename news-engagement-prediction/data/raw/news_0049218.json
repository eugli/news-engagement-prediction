Would that work?” Grant says, according to a transcript obtained by the Deseret News. \nShe says the two can “think of something to say.” \n“I am sure we can think of something,” she says. Michael John Franco (Indio Police Department) \n“What do you want me to say? What should I say?” \nThe transcript notes that parts of the call are inaudible, according to the Sun. The voicemail came from Franco's phone and ended up in the mailbox of a friend. \nFranco has pleaded not guilty to the slaying. But court filings say he allegedly confessed to a cellmate that he cut his girlfriend’s throat during a fight, took her to a golf course and killed her when she tried to escape. \nProsecutors said they also have security footage of Franco using Grant’s ATM card to take money the night she was killed. He was busted with bank cards, a cellphone and a Glock pistol all belonging to her. \nAfter police Tasered and arrested him, Franco allegedly said he was trying to flee to Mexico but would now be “going to prison for the rest of his life,” prosecutors said.
