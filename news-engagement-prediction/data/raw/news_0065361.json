And while City remain in the last 16 of the Champions League, it wasn’t enough.

His status as the most successful Leicester City manager of all time is without question. \n“However, domestic results in the current campaign have placed the Club’s Premier League status under threat and the Board reluctantly feels that a change of leadership, while admittedly painful, is necessary in the club’s greatest interest.” Leicester’s favourite son and most famous fan was apoplectic. After all that Claudio Ranieri has done for Leicester City, to sack him now is inexplicable, unforgivable and gut-wrenchingly sad. — Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) February 23, 2017 And the verdict of the football pundits ... — Alan Shearer (@alanshearer) February 23, 2017 Winning the Premier League the \" New Poisoned Chalice \"Conte sacked next season!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:40:06.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
