(REUTERS) \nUS defence firm Lockheed Martin wants to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understands President Donald Trump’s administration may want to take a “fresh look” at the proposal. \nWith no more orders for the F-16 from the Pentagon, Lockheed plans to use its Fort Worth, Texas plant instead to produce the fifth generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that the United States Air Force is transitioning to. \nLockheed would switch F-16 production to India, as long as the Indian government agrees to order hundreds of the planes that its air force desperately needs. \nTrump has criticised US companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the US. In his first few weeks in office, he has pushed companies, from automakers to pharmaceutical firms, to produce more in the United States.

But if they don’t move production to India, there’s no way they’ll get the India contract,” the person said. \nOne argument to be made was that moving to India would preserve some component production in the United States. “Twenty-five percent of something is better than zero percent of nothing,” the person said. “We’ve briefed the administration on the current proposal, which was supported by the Obama administration as part of a broader cooperative dialogue with the government of India” \nNo threat to USjobs \nLockheed has said that moving F-16 assembly to India would create 200 engineering jobs in the United States to help support the production line in India. \nIt has also said that about 800 workers in the United States making the non-Lockheed parts for the F-16 would keep their jobs if construction shifts to India. \n“We are offering to make the F-16 Block-70 aircraft with a local partner in India. This is an offer exclusive to India,” Randall L Howard, head of F-16 business development, told Reuters ahead of India’s biggest air show beginning in Bengaluru next week. \nIn India, the F-16 is up against SAAB’s Gripen combat aircraft, which the Swedish firm has also offered to make locally, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi drives a Make-in-India campaign to build a domestic aerospace industry and reduce costly imports. \nThe Indian government is expected to decide this year on which company will build a single-engine fighter plane, in collaboration with a local partner. A defence official said the process was at a very early stage.

The challenge now is to pick the right partners,” Paranjape said. \n(Additional reporting by Andrea Shalal in Berlin) tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:53:25.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
