Exum sparks Jazz blowout 0:56 \nNBA: The topsy-turvy third year of Dante Exum appears to be on a strong upward turn with the lengthy guard making the most of his 23 minutes against the Pelicans. February 9th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Exum sparks Jazz blowout \nThe decision to pull out of his Dutch commitments came hot on the heels of Kyrgios’ controversial “tanking” performance at the Shanghai Masters . \nRotterdam tournament director Richard Krajicek was sympathetic to Kyrgios when explaining his decision to allow the Australian to renege on his contract. \n“You see what can happen when he is tired and (tennis) has little meaning, as in China. We do not want that,” Krajicek said. \n“So we decided to terminate his contract. We want a top tennis player seen on the court. Kyrgios prefers his passion beyond his profession. \n“If every week he is focused on tennis, he might be mentally burned out after six months. He needs an outlet.” \nNBA All-Star Celebrity Game teams \nTeam Smith (West) : Miles Brown (actor), Tom Cavanagh (actor), Mark Cuban (Mavs owner), Baron Davis, Andy Grammer (recording artist) Jiang Jinfu (actor, model), Anthony Mackie (actor), Romeo Miller (rapper), Hasan Minhaj (actor, comedian), Master P (rapper), Candace Parker (WNBA), Aaron Sanchez (celebrity chef) \nTeam Hill (East) : Brandon Armstrong (former NBA), Win Butler (Arcade Fire), Nick Cannon, Rachel DeMita (NBA2K TV personality), Ansel Elgort (actor, recording artist), Marc Lasry (Bucks owner), Caleb McLaughlin (actor), Peter Rosenberg (media personality), Oscar Schmidt (former NBA), Lindsay Whalen (WNBA), Jason Williams, Kris Wu (recording artist)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:30:13.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
