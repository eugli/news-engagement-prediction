On Thursday’s episode of Undisputed , with only hours left until the trade deadline at 3:00 p.m ET, Shannon Sharpe and Skip Bayless broke down whether the defending NBA champions need to make a move, and Bayless argued the Cavaliers could set themselves up for a run of titles if they could still land Carmelo Anthony. Shannon: Patrick Beverley would be a good fit for Cleveland “Yes, and when I say he needs more help, or when LeBron says he needs more help, he’s not asking for Boogie Cousins or Paul George . He’s saying ‘I need a point guard - a backup point guard - and I need a big. He needs someone that can initiate the offense if he and Kyrie are on the bench simultaneously. Because right now, what happens [is] one of those guys has to be on the court at all times or there’s nothing that gets done. I would hate to give up Iman Shumpert because he is a great on-ball defender and he’s been shooting the three really well, but Patrick Beverley is also a very good on-ball defender. He’s averaging about 4.5 assists per game… and considering that James Harden has the ball in his hands about 95 percent of the time, for him to have that many assists - it lets you know that he is a very quality point guard and he would serve the Cavaliers really well.” Bob Donnan Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports Shannon: The Cavs don't need another star, they need key role players “They also need a big, because at the end of the day when you look at the way they’re constructed, Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson are the only two true bigs they have. Channing Frye is seven feet tall but he’s really not a big, he’s a shooter. Now his last outing I think he had a double-double, but that’s an anomaly. He’s more of a three-or-four rebound per game [guy], and he’s really not much of a defender, especially on the block. It’s not like [LeBron] is asking ‘I need Boogie, I need Paul George.’ Because what he saw this summer is that he saw a 73-9 team upgrade. Because if you look at it, Kevin Durant is the third-biggest free agent to ever change teams. I would go maybe Shaq and LeBron, 1a, 1b. Kevin Durant is three behind those two. And so LeBron is like ‘OK, I need to make a move.’ Be he also sees the Raptors, they got Serge Ibaka. Boston Celtics, they’re trying to make a run at Jimmy Butler… LeBron is saying ‘look, give me a backup point guard, give me a big. I’ll do the rest.’ ” Derick E. Hingle Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports Skip: The Cavs have a golden opportunity “Let me get this straight, I’m going to ask you one more time. Who won on Christmas Day in Cleveland, Golden State at Cleveland? Who won that game… who is three games ahead of the Boston Celtics as we speak, in the Eastern Conference, in first place? The Cavaliers. Do you think Cleveland, with no more help, will win the East?\" Shannon: \"It’s not about the East.\" Skip: \"Thank you. It’s about Golden State in the Finals. …. Guess what, the heavens have opened. A silver platter opportunity has presented itself on this day in Cleveland, Ohio.” Bob Donnan Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports Skip: If the Knicks will trade Carmelo for Kevin Love, Cleveland has to do it “Melo happens to be in Cleveland as we speak… who is one of the closest friends to one LeBron James. So, I’m going to say it again. Of all the things that have ever happened in my career, something is on the table that nobody wants to talk about - and it’s Carmelo Anthony straight up for Kevin Love. And I would submit to you, if we went into any barbershop in America… and you ask everybody in the barbershop ‘who’s the better player: Carmelo or Kevin Love?’ What would they all say? Everybody would say it’s Carmelo! It would be laughable to even try to put Kevin Love in the same sentence. So if, in fact, the Knicks would still do this… all of a sudden, Kevin Love has proven to be a brittle, injury-plagued player. Because if I go down the list, the litany of injuries. He’s had a concussion, he’s had a dislocated shoulder, he’s got a recurring bad back, he’s had a broken hand, he’s had a bad groin injury, and now he’s had knee surgery. One thing after another for Kevin Love.\" Bob Donnan Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports Skip: A trade would revitalize Carmelo \n\"And you say ‘oh he’s a better fit.’ Carmelo Anthony is stuck in the worst fit of his career with the lowdown skunk that is the New York Knicks run by Phil Jackson right now, and Phil’s trying to run Carmelo out of town. And he is a shadow of what he used to be, and it’s because of his emotions and his psyche right now. He doesn’t want to play basketball. He’s lost all heart and all hope in New York City. If you took him out of New York and you made him LeBron’s teammate, you would see not the old Carmelo - the guy who just looks old right now - you’d see the Carmelo of old . You’d see new pep in his step. You’d see a happy, comfortable, calm, re-energized Carmelo Anthony. He is still a big-time, top-10 player in this league, and he would take Cleveland up another level. Not so much in the Eastern Conference Playoffs, I’m talking about against Golden State.\" Derick E. Hingle Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports Skip: Carmelo is the perfect guy to help LeBron in his pursuit of MJ \n\"He’s star power, he’s firepower. Is he a longer-term fit than Kevin Love is? No. Carmelo is 32 years of age, Kevin Love is 28. But if Carmelo at 32 could give you two big-time years with LeBron James as LeBron’s window starts to close in Cleveland, why not maximize LeBron’s chances of winning more championships ? Of ‘catching Michael Jordan.’ The guy who could do it right here, right now, is Carmelo . And if you could get him straight up for Kevin Love, boom-boom, and they just switch uniforms tonight, why wouldn’t you do that? It’s dumbfounding to me that people wouldn’t be all over this, be campaigning for Cleveland to make this move, because it makes nothing but sense for LeBron James. And if you put LeBron on a lie detector right here, right now, I promise you he’d say ‘you’d give me Carmelo for Kevin Love? I’d take him!’\" Derick E. Hingle Derick E.
