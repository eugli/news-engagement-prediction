(AFP) \nBao Bao, the three-year-old giant panda who rose to fame while growing up on live video at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington, left for her new home in China on Tuesday under a long-standing breeding and research programme. \nBao Bao could be seen in live video provided by the zoo being loaded, inside her crate, onto a Boeing 777F aircraft at the Dulles International Airport in Virginia for Chengdu, China. \nThe freighter, customized with an image of a giant panda emblazoned on its side, took off just before 2 pm.

She will be greeted by her new keepers upon arrival in Chengdu. \nBao Bao was born at the zoo on August 23, 2013 to mother Mei Xiang and father Tian Tian, who were loaned to the zoo as part of an agreement with the Chinese Wildlife Conservation Association. \nUnder the deal, all cubs born at the National Zoo must move to China by the time they reach 4 years old for breeding and research. \nThe National Zoo received its first pair of giant pandas in 1972 as a gift from the Chinese government. That pair, female Ling-Ling and male Hsing-Hsing, lived at the zoo for more than 20 years, but produced no surviving cubs.
