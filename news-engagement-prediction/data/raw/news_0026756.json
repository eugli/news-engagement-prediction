Article continues below \nA player of CR7's talent was never going to go unnoticed, though, and if United hadn't got there first, it's almost certain he'd still have been snapped up by a top club. \nIt seems a lot of big clubs will look back at Ronaldo as a 'what if?' moment.

Juve made contact \n\"I called my club and told them I'd seen someone who would be the best player in the world, obviously after Maradona,\" Di Marzio said. \nExplaining why then, the Ballon d'Or holder never made the switch to the Old Lady, he placed the blame firmly at the feet of one man - former Juve striker Marcelo Salas, who was supposed to be part of a swap deal. \n\"I negotiated and brought Cristiano over to Turin in 2002 to sign for Juve, but Salas didn't accept the terms of the swap,\" he added. \n\"For just a few million euros, Salas didn't want to leave and so Juventus lost out on Cristiano Ronaldo.\" \nIt sounds like the Chilean might not want to set foot in Turin again for a while if that's true. \nWhile Juve have boasted their fair share of big names over the last fifteen years - Paul Pogba, Andrea Pirlo, and Gianluigi Buffon, to name but a few - their fans must be frustrated to hear that they missed out on a player of Ronaldo's class. \nWould Ronaldo be the same player if he'd joined Juve?
