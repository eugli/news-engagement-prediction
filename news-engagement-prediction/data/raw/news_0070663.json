Somehow, it became cool not to care. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below But I will freely admit that I did imagine my wedding, from the time I was a child playing out soap opera scenarios with my Barbies, all the way up until I got engaged last summer. However, instead of daydreaming about what I wanted in a wedding, I mostly focused on what I didn’t want. And what I didn’t want was a wedding like any other wedding I had been to or seen, because I am a unique individual, with unique ideas, uniquely unlike the billions of brides that came before me. Did I mention I am unique? The writer and her husband-to-be. Courtesy of Hanna LoPatin​ Yes, I was that girl who watched Say Yes to the Dress and rolled my eyes at all the tortured discussion surrounding what was essentially an expensive pile of tulle masquerading as a false flag of virginal innocence. I would never obsess like that over a dress that would only be worn once. Fast forward to me joyfully ringing a bell in the middle of a David’s Bridal in Burbank, California to mark my commitment to an ivory lace sheath at the very top of my budget. It seems that despite my best efforts and instincts, I became a basic bitch bride. Honestly, the basicness started the minute we began researching venues. Though we live across the country in Los Angeles, my fiancé and I wanted to get married in Michigan, where we both grew up. A quick Google search led us to the Taj Mahal of the basic wedding venues: a farm. While the rest of the country might think of Michigan as mostly farmland, we grew up close to Detroit. Think Motown and ruin porn. As natives of the land of Eminem, we have no more business getting married on a farm then we do at George Clooney’s Lake Como estate. But once we toured the 18th Century farmhouse and string-lit barn, we booked it immediately (opting out of the presence of the advertised “adorable goats”) and were well into our mad descent into Pinterest-land. I had always insisted that my brother would be one of my bridesmaids. Bridesman? I wasn’t going to be ruled by gender norms! It was sexist and wrong… except that the numbers were uneven, and suddenly my brother became a groomsman and I abandoned all my ideals so our pictures wouldn’t look lopsided. But if you think about it, it’s not like I’m going to invite my little brother to my bachelorette party, right? And also, symmetry! A basic, blushing bridesmaid. Stocksy Speaking of bridesmaids, though I spared them a uniform dress straight out of Katherine Heigl’s closet, I did ask them all to choose a dress in the girliest color of all – blush. It’s like I’m fricking Julia Roberts in Steel Magnolias . And let’s be honest, when my mom gave her bridesmaids a “pick your own dress” directive back in the '70s it was cool and different. Now, mismatched dresses are as ubiquitous at weddings as choreographed flash mobs. In no time, my Americano with a hint of almond milk wedding had turned into a pumpkin spice latte. And I drank that shit up, ordering napkins with our initials in that cutesy font — you know that font. I hired a videographer who would give us that three minute highlight reel that makes us look like the stars of a romantic comedy. I even bought a chalkboard to display the menu. Shudder. I was a monster. But here’s the thing about adhering to all the wedding clichés, both new and old: they are clichés because they’re fucking great. The blush is going to contrast beautifully against the lush green backdrop of the farm. I feel like Beyonce in that ivory white gown. And the tea light lanterns that my future mother-in-law scored for the walkway from the tent to the barn are going to be add the perfect magical glow as the sun sets behind the hill. (Bonus point: They were recycled from someone else’s wedding, so I’m saving the environment while I wed. Suck on that!) Beautiful, basic tea lights. Getty Images We have the tendency to assume that if something is popular, it’s also shitty. But this is the thinking of a sullen hipster who stopped listening to his favorite band because they “sold out.” That hipster might retain his street cred as an arbiter of good taste and feed his pathological need to feel special and unique, but he’s also missing out on something that could give him joy. And who is he to talk? He probably has a '70s pornstache. I don’t want to be the bride with the metaphorical pornstache. Let’s be real, marriage itself is full of out-of-date basicness. If I was really rebelling against societal norms, I wouldn’t be getting married at all. Considering that marriage began as a property exchange between patriarchal families, we should all be running for the hills. But marriage has evolved. I know I am entering into a partnership with someone who sees me as his true equal. Women have worked so hard to reinvent the terms of marriage — we don’t have to reinvent the wedding, as well. And so, this May, I will be walked down the aisle by both my parents (a Jewish tradition I was happy not to mess with), in an expensive white dress matched with a pair of straight-off-Pinterest Converse and marry my love surrounded by my closest friends and family. Just like almost every other basic bitch bride that has gone before me. But the wedding doesn’t define our relationship. We're still completely special, unique and quintessentially “us.” A final exit through a row of sparklers won’t change that. But rest assured, no matter how basic my wedding might be, there will be not a single mason jar in sight. Follow Hanna on Twitter.
