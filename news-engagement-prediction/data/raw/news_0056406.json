A post shared by Cheryl (@cherylofficial) on Feb 22, 2017 at 9:00am PST \nTaking to Instagram, the 33-year-old shared a throwback snap from 2010 in the run up to the awards, with her wearing a silver dress which featured a sheer skirt and fringed shoulders. \nAs she leaned against the wall, Cheryl showed off her slim legs and gave a sultry stare down the camera lens. \nShe captioned the shot: “Wishing all the Brit nominees and performers good luck for the show tonight. PA:Press Association 4 The star has been keeping a low profile over the last couple of months \n“Looking forward to it. In the meantime here is my #tb #bts vogue shoot I did for the Brits 2010.” \nThe star’s fans couldn’t get enough of the glamorous picture, with many commenting on how beautiful she looked, while others lamented how much they miss her on social media these days. PA:Press Association 4 Cheryl has attended the awards bash on a number of occasions over the years \nCheryl’s post comes after it was claimed by Closer magazine that the singer has turned to American reality star Kourtney Kardashian for parenting advice. \nAn insider told Closer: “She spoke to lots of her friends who are mums including Kourtney. She has always admired how she has such a close bond with her children, and how she’s managed to raise them when she has such a high-profile career and is photographed everywhere she goes.” Getty Images Cheryl’s band Girls Aloud won at the ceremony and performed on a number of occasions RELATED STORIES NO PAYNE NO GAIN Liam Payne to have mansion renovated ahead of arrival of first child with Cheryl next month 'WE HAD NO IDEA' Reggie and Bollie reveal 'boss' Cheryl is keeping her pregnancy SO secretive she still hasn’t told them 'A GENIUS AT WORK' Liam Payne poses with Drake while pregnant Cheryl stays home... as fans hope for collaboration SITTING TIGHT Cheryl’s baby due date is still ‘several weeks away’ as the star prepares for the arrival \nCheryl’s baby is due in the upcoming weeks and she has already moved into Liam’s Surrey mansion, however while they are taking care of the practicalities such as making their home baby-friendly , Kourtney is helping Chezza learn how to put herself in the spotlight and raise a child. Fame Flynet 4 Mum-of-three Kourntey Kardashian even gave birth in front of the cameras \nThe source continued: “Kourtney and the rest of the Kardashian family know more than anyone what it’s like to be under scrutiny all the time and how difficult it is to raise your children when you put yourself in the spotlight. \n“Khloe suggested it would be a good idea for Cheryl to chat with Kourtney and she asked her sister to message her a couple of months ago. Since then they’ve had a few conversations. \n“Cheryl is really pleased to hear the advice from Kourtney because being in the spotlight means she can’t really go to local mum-to-be groups and talk about what she’s going through. So Kourtney’s been a God-send.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:42:41.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
