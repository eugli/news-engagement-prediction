And what makes the UCLA commit’s performance even crazier is that he \"only\" had 51 points entering the fourth quarter. But he went off for 41 in the final eight minutes to end the game just eight points shy of the elusive 100-point mark that has only been achieved by a handful of players throughout the course of basketball history. A photo posted by LaMelo Ball (@swaggymelo1) on May 12, 2016 at 4:50pm PDT Ball’s stat line is obviously insane. He made 37 of the 61 shots he took during the game, including 7 of 22 three-pointers. He also hit 11 of 14 shots from the free-throw line. And he helped his team avenge their recent loss to high school powerhouse Oak Hill Academy, which ended a streak of 60 straight wins for Chino Hills. But the Los Osos head coach was not happy after the game. He called Ball’s performance a \"joke\" and said that the only reason he was able to eclipse the 90-point mark was because his teammates kept fouling Los Osos players to give him more opportunities. \"That’s wrong,\" coach Dave Smith said. \"It goes against everything [the California Interscholastic Federation] stands for. The Ball boys are very talented and great players, but it’s embarrassing to high school athletics.\" Regardless of what you think about the 92-point game, there was some good to come out of it.
