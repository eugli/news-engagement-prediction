Bharat Stage IV standards for cars release particulates, which are 50 per cent cleaner than Bharat Stage III standards. Also, Bharat Stage IV particle standards for trucks are 81 per cent cleaner. Uniform emissions standards will allow trucks and interstate buses to move to cleaner fuel and technology that otherwise pollute cities during transit. 3. Reformed taxation policies that reduce incentives to purchase diesel cars. The report blames the decreasing price gap between diesel fuel and petrol as the reason behind the rise of dieselisation of cars. The World Health Organisation has officially classified diesel emissions as class I carcinogen for its strong link with lung cancer, placing it in the same class as tobacco smoking. \nBCCL EPCA has suggested to the SC in its report that it levy an extra 30 per cent environment compensation charge on private diesel cars. The revenue of this source can then be used to kickstart the widespread implementation of Bharat Stage V and Bharat Stage VI across the country and also improve public transport. 4. Improve public transport and last mile connectivity By 2020, the capital wants 80 per cent of its population to use public transport. Although the government has enforced measures to switch people from private to public transportation, change, however, is coming slower than expected and wanted. \nBCCL According to EPCA, change can be accelerated by increasing the number of buses and also improving service in terms of reliability, frequency, comfort and access. The capital also needs to fix bottlenecks as well as terminal and parking facilities. It has asked the court to order the government of NCT to introduce 11,000 buses in 2017 or face contempt. 5. Improve walkability and create more cycle paths Public transport cannot be improved by only rolling out more buses. It can only work as a solution in conjunction with other factors. The key ones being safety and comfort for pedestrians and cyclists. EPCA revealed interesting data in this regard – while the city witnessed high road accidents where one person is either killed or injured every hour, it also has one of the highest numbers of walkers and cyclists in the country. In order to improve connectivity, EPCA proposes that the network of cycle and pedestrian lanes be expanded, keeping a high degree of safety in mind. 6. Improve connectivity in NCR \nBCCL A 2005 RITES report revealed that an average of 1.53 million inner city trips is made every day to Delhi. While the traffic to and from NCR towns has exploded, the means of transportation to get around has not moved in step with the growth. The lack of connectivity has pushed people to private and personal modes of transportation, which has added to pollution and congestion. 7. Reform taxation policies that are currently higher on buses than cars Ironically, buses that meet 40 per cent of the city’s travel requirements are taxed higher than cars, which is hurting public transport. EPCA believes that public policy needs to be such that it reduces the tax burden on public transport and counter revenue loss from that sector but imposes higher taxes on personal vehicles. 8. Restraint the growth of private cars by reforming parking policy EPCA claimed that car growth is getting out of hand because of hidden subsidies. Car users, it said, pay almost nothing for using public space to park personal vehicles. In fact, it pointed out that Delhi has some of the lowest parking charges in the world, in comparison to both more developed cities such as London and Paris, and less developed cities such as Cape Town and Beijing. \nBCCL According to EPCA, congestion and parking chaos can be controlled if effective and stringent pricing is enforced along with the high penalty for illegal parking. This will work if authorities demarcate legal parking areas, and also use strong measures to enforce it. This will help free up public spaces for walking and cycling. 9. Enforce tough quality and fitness measures on private vehicles Old and poorly maintained vehicles increase above-average emissions. The government should ensure through stringent measures that vehicles are properly maintained. EPCA said a barrier to this is the difference in road taxes – the capital has one of the lowest road taxes in the country, and Haryana even lower. So, the EPCA proposes that the governments of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan impose a homogenous road tax. 10. Implement a daily alert on air quality \nReuters Since air quality levels in Delhi-NCR have reached detrimental levels, it’s important that the public is aware of the kind of air they are breathing. In the plan, EPCA proposes to the SC that all state governments of Delhi-NCR, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh relay real-time air quality data to the public on an everyday basis. The Capital urgently needs some effective policies to reduce toxic pollution levels in the city. Although these steps look promising, everything depends on how the authorities implement it at the ground level, and also how people abide by them.
