Brandon Beach, R-Alpharetta , said he does not have the votes to get Senate Bill 79 out of the Senate Regulated Industries Committee.\n“I am not discouraged,” Beach said. “I will double down and plan to crisscross the state starting in April” to build support for the bill in 2018.\n» Feeling lucky? Travel to these four casinos closest to Atlanta\nBeach said he will visit local Rotary clubs, speak with education leaders, hospital administrators and anyone else who will listen to garner public backing.\nBeach worked for months to craft a plan that could appease all factions. His original plan called for up to six casinos and a horse racing track across the state.\nHe eventually pared that down to no more than two \"destination resort” casinos with proceeds from a 20 percent tax going to a host of interests, from HOPE scholarships, to needs-based college grants, rural trauma care and rural hospitals, to broadband Internet infrastructure to law enforcement raises.\nIn the end, no matter how he tried to divvy up the spoils, Beach could not pull the support he needed to get it out of committee.\n“You can tell everyone, like Arnold Schwarzenegger said, ‘”I’ll be back ,’” Beach said.\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution will again have Georgia’s largest team covering the Legislature.
