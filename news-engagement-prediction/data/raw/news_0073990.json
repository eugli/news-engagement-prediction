They want to move on. \nThe big question is why on earth do clubs allow such clauses in contracts? It may help backend contracts, but like leaving the dishes overnight to do the next morning, it just delays the inevitable. \nAccording to one agent, the practice is dying off overseas but is still relevant with A-League clubs. Sooner the day it becomes extinct here, the better. Just hope for Victory’s sake, it doesn’t cost them dearly this season. \nUNSUNG \nDon’t know how referees think – they’re cut from different cloth to be brave enough to do what they do – but Chris Beath may be thankful for the idiots in the crowd last week who hogged all the headlines due to their infantile behavior. By Monday, a discussion about the missed pens in the Sydney Derby was harder to find than a bottle-o in Riyadh. \nTHAT ALL NOT SAID… one thing remains a mystery; why wasn’t the best ref doing the game? \nJarred Gillett is that best ref (Perth fans, it still hurts, doesn’t it?). \nHe proved it again on Friday night. His communication with the players is first rate, and he remains the least likely to commit a howler. Provided he is not mocked by such praise, which is entirely possible, surely he gets all the big games from here on in. \nSURPRISE \nPerth to third? That happened quickly. Not saying they are a one man team, but they wouldn’t be third without Diego Castro. \nThat’s an irrelevant point if there ever was one because they DO have him - and how good is he to watch! Perth Glory v Western Sydney: Match Highlights 3:58 \nA-League: Catch all the highlights from the Perth Glory's clash with the Western Sydney Wanderers. February 26th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/sourceId/609949/ Perth Glory v Western Sydney: Match Highlights \nThe run to the finals is not a simple one – Glory meet all of the teams around them; Victory away, Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne City at home. \nFinishing third or fourth is crucial for them - too inconsistent away from home this season, they need that first home final, then go to Sydney or Victory and aim for a boil over to make the decider. \nUNSURPRISE \nNot an A-League issue, but a comment on something very relevant to Australia football - the whisper about Ange Postecoglou becoming a target of the richest club football has ever seen –“Unnamed Chinese Club FC” \nIt is known last October and November Shanghai Shenhua were aggressively pursuing a new boss, and amongst other candidates “more than one” Australian was approached (they went for Gus Poyet in the end). While Ange’s name wasn’t linked, one can only imagine he’d be near the top of any list involving Australians. \nUnless there’s a complete breakdown in relations with the FFA – and that doesn’t seem to be anywhere near the truth now – it’s hard to see him going anywhere until after the World Cup, at which time he will go. Unless we win it. Come on, it’s the ‘Season of the Imagination’.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:54:20.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
