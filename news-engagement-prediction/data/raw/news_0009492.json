Several other would-be buyers — including an active-wear clad woman who sprinted in, while double parked, to make four enthusiastic bids — offered to buy it, but it was a local land holder adept at “cherry picking the best sites” who paid $1,645,000 to decide its future. \nThe rundown home sold for $1,645,000 at auction. Photo: Nelson Alexander \nBefore the “end of an era” auction, Mr Alexiadis spruiked the Victorian’s attractions, being: “An awesome home with great land in one of the hottest spots in Melbourne.” He’s right about the location, though it hasn’t always been that way, admitted vendor Anne Fisher. \n“Thornbury’s hugely different to when I grew up in the house in the 60s-80s,” she laughed, after admitting that she was “blown away” by the result. “If people asked where you lived, you’d mumble quietly and hope they didn’t hear!” \nWhile the new owner joked about building 10-storeys, Mrs Fisher was jubilant about the result. “It’s a big result, it’s a lovely result. It means that everybody gets the chance to do something further with their lives,” she said. \nThe property at 1/123 Blyth Street, Altona, attracted interest from the elderly and first home buyers. Photo: Hocking Stuart \nMeanwhile, almost by the sea in sunny Altona, a cautious tenant was defending his bond by keeping an eye on what sticky beakers were bringing into the unit – which kept him just as busy as the coffee cart man outside. \nThe spacious two-bedroom unit at 1/123 Blyth Street had attracted interest from the elderly and first home buyers, and sold with just three would-be buyers in the crowd of 80 showing interest. \nA nervous man standing with his excited family made a $600,000 start, and a middle-aged couple enthusiastically outbid him. A young woman then offered $700,000 but the couple beat her with $720,000. \nThis villa at 1/123 Blyth Street, Altona, has two bedrooms. Photo: Hocking Stuart \nAlready sweating, Hocking Stuart auctioneer Gus Anile said he was happy to stand out in the sun for longer, though that promise didn’t help him eek out another bid from anyone else, including the woman. Having already conceded that the unit was on the market, he sold it to the couple.
