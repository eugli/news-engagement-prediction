Martin's Bar-B-Que Joint, which has quickly grown to become one of the city's top barbecue spots, is preparing to open its fifth Middle Tennessee location in Spring Hill this fall, founder Pat Martin told me Tuesday. Pit master and founder Pat Martin of Martin's Bar-B-Que Joint Nathan Morgan | Nashville Business Journal The restaurant will take up 4,500 square feet in Fresh Hospitality's Spring Hill development, Shoppes at Springhill , Martin said. Martin has been partners with Michael Bodnar and other Fresh Hospitality partners since 2010. “I’ve gotten more out of that marriage than I ever expected to get,\" Martin said. Accompanying the Martin's in Spring Hill will be a new location of 55 South, the downtown Franklin restaurant, Martin said. Records from the Tennessee Secretary of State's office indicate that McConnell Hospitality Group, which owns 55 South, recently partnered with Fresh Hospitality . Martin said his restaurant and 55 South will share a beer garden in the development. \"It's a really cool building design ... not some crappy strip center,\" Martin said. When they open, the two restaurants will likely become two of the most notable restaurants in Spring Hill, where an Olive Garden has been voted as the 10th best restaurant according to TripAdvisor . Martin is confident he will be successful in the Williamson County town. \"I like Spring Hill. I’ve been in and around Franklin, Thompson’s Station and Spring Hill a lot in my life. It reminds me a lot of Mt. Juliet, and our store is really successful in Mt. Juliet,\" Martin said. \"There are more disposable dollars down there than you would think.\" Fresh Hospitality partner Matt Bodnar could not immediately be reached Tuesday afternoon for comment. Likewise, a representative for 55 South could not be immediately reached. Jacob Steimer covers Music City's tourism, hospitality and music business industries.
