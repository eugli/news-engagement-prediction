By February 18, it was reported that Reeves had dropped out because a deal could not be struck. Ridley Scott and Fede Alvarez were kept on the backburner.

He is such an iconic and compelling character, and one that resonates with me deeply. I am incredibly honoured and excited to be working with Warner Bros. to bring an epic and emotional new take on the Caped Crusader to the big screen,” he said. \nWarner Bros chief content officer echoed Reeves’ excitement in his statement: “We are thrilled to have Matt Reeves taking the helm of Batman, the crown jewel of our DC slate. Matt’s deep roots in genre films and his evolution into an emotional world-building director make him the perfect filmmaker to guide the Dark Knight through this next journey.” Read more The Lego Batman Movie review: For a film that makes a joke about Gandhi, it’s great \nInterestingly, none of these statements mention star Ben Affleck at all. Collider is reporting that the official press release by WB also makes no mention of Affleck, who was rumoured to be having apprehensions about playing the character. \nBut the last official word from him came in the form of his first statement in which he reassured fans that he “was still in this” and “extremely committed to this project.” Affleck will reprise his role as the Dark Knight for November’s Justice League. \nFollow @htshowbiz for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:21:05.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
