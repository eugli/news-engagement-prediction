They have a history behind them and we are keen to reunite Mr Blain with his medals.\nâ€“ Detective Constable Jo Heard Some of the medals do have names or regiment numbers on the back and Kent police are asking to be contacted if anyone comes across them.\nLast updated Thu 23 Feb 2017 Kent", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:26:27.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
