The film opened with an occupancy of just 10 per cent and while we expected it to increase during the afternoon shows, looks like there hasn’t been any improvement. Trade sources have revealed that the occupancy has gone up to 15 per cent, but Rangoon will only be able to earn Rs 4-6 crore on day one. While this is a really average number, it is even worse for such a huge film featuring biggies like Shahid, Saif and Kangana. \nTalking about the occupancy and the box office predictions for the movie, trade expert Akshaye Rathi (exhibitor and distributor) reveals, “ Rangoon has had a disastrous opening. The occupancy has been 10 per cent across India during the morning shows. With the kind of reports coming in, I don’t think that the film will see a huge growth. On day one, I expect Rangoon to rake in Rs 3.50-4 crore. And while there is a good social media buzz, there is a real buzz too and the latter is very contrasting to the social media buzz.” ALSO READ – Shahid, Kangana and Saif’s Rangoon starts off on a disastrous note with just 10 per cent occupancy in the morning shows \nHowever, trade expert, Amul Mohan (Editor of Super Cinema) gives us another interesting viewpoint. He explains, “ Rangoon has got a slow start, but these kind of movies pick up later. Generally these kind of films pick up more in the evening shows and I guess Rangoon can make anywhere above Rs 6 crore. But then, it can always increase because of the evening shows. ” \nWith the late night shows just starting, trade sources mention that Rangoon might see a growth in occupancy to about 25 to 35 per cent. But still this is not the ideal start for a film of this magnitude. However, there is a ray of light for Rangoon as the audience has started to speak about the film and the performances of all the actors. Obviously, the film has got mixed reviews from the critics, but a good word-of-mouth publicity can help its box office prospects.
