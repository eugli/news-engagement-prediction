The FM took the liberty to miss the 3 per cent fiscal deficit target and raised it marginally to 3.2 per cent to create some legroom for himself; but nobody is complaining as it is unlikely to crowd out private investment. \n\nJaitley tried to stimulate the economy by boosting a key demand driver: real estate; he redefined the term affordable housing by raising the size of house by 30 sq ft; accorded infrastructure status to affordable housing to draw new investors, set a target of 1 crore rural housing units by 2019, granted more money to NABARD to infuse liquidity in the industry and allowed other procedural concessions. \n\nThe Finance Minister lowered the rate at entry-level income-tax to 5 per cent from 10 per cent, which effectively reduces the tax burden to zero for an individual earning up to Rs 3 lakh, and up to Rs 4.5 lakh for those availing the benefits of tax exemptions under Section 80C. In higher salary brackets, this offers a tax saving of about Rs 13,000. \n\nTo achieve this, he played Robin Hood and taxed the rich with a 10% surcharge on incomes between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore and maintaining the super-rich tax at the existing level. \n\nBelying market speculations, the Finance Minister left the long-term capital gains tax on equity investment, STT and other taxes untouched., tweaked the domestic transfer pricing rules and exempted some FPIs from indirect transfer provision. He also further clarified the GAAR rules. \n\n“It was already hinted that FPIs would be spared from the implications arising from indirect transfer by keeping the recently issued clarifications on hold. The proposed amendment to the law would rest at anxiety apprehensions of foreign investors,” said Pranay Bhatia, Partner – Direct Tax, BDO India \n\nBoosting investor confidence, the FM also proposal to abolish the FIPB, a body that clears proposals envisaging foreign investment up to Rs 5,000 crore. This clearly reflected the government’s commitment for creating an condusive investment environment for FIIs. \n\nMore to come... \nStay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:34:14.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
