Saying I’m standing in front of the dartboard on purpose, that’s a terrible claim ... You can’t claim that about someone.” Triple M's Grill Team: Emma Freedman, Gus Worland, Matty Johns, Mark Geyer and Chris Page. Source: Supplied \nThe Triple M hosts argued that accusing someone of standing in front of a dartboard is “minimal” compared to labelling someone an anti-semite, but Malkah didn’t agree. \n“Not to me, I take my darts seriously,” she said. \n“If you take your darts as seriously as I do, I took great offence to that.” \nA clearly unimpressed Matty Johns continued to press Malkah, saying, “But Tziporah, you love stirring the pot. That’s what you do”. \n“No I don’t,” she fired back, “how would you know that? Do you know me?” \n“Watching you, my observation is you would stir the pot and then you would go, ‘oh why are you turning on me?’” Johns said. \n“What pot?” asked an argumentative Malkah, “What pot did I stir?” \nCo-host Mark Geyer tried to get the interview back on track by asking Malkah if she’s keen to “rejoin the TV world” after her time on I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here! \n“Oh ... I don’t know,” she said, “does it mean I have to talk to you people all the time?” \nAnd with that, the Triple M hosts had had enough. \n“No, but believe us, this will be the first and last time you speak to us,” Gus Worland said. \n“OK, good,” Malkah replied. \nAs they wrapped up the interview, Worland started to promote the next episode of the Ten show, saying, “To watch all the other celebrities who actually sound like half decent people ...” \n“Oh she’s playing a role,” Geyer said to his co-host. \n“I don’t think she plays a role,” Worland said, “I think that’s exactly who she is and she’s awful.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:12:29.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
