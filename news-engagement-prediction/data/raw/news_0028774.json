About five minutes from Times Square, neon-clad Yotel appears ready to blast off on a space mission. Galactic decor aside, the futuristic spot is full of time-saving, tech-savvy details -- think touch-screen check-in machines, an automated \"Yobot\" that leases out luggage lockers and a mobile concierge app dubbed \"Shaggy.\" Across the hotels' abundant common areas, there's fast Wi-Fi; an open-plan cafe that doubles as an unofficial co-working space; a dedicated floor for meetings, project launches and conferences; and the largest outdoor hotel terrace in the city for after-work drinks. Designed to feel like business-class cabins, bright white interiors and purple accents set the tone of the 713 high-voltage rooms. Another clever touch: Serta smart beds stow away into the wall to free up space during the day, only to slide into place with the push of a button when it's time to power down.
