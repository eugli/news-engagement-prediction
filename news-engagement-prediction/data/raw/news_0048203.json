Trump, discussing terror, seamlessly mentions incident \"last night in Sweden\".There was NO \"incident\" in Sweden last night. pic.twitter.com/XtcC4PRiNU — Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 19, 2017 \nThe problem, of course, was that there was no incident in Sweden Friday night, as countless critics and observers—including Sweden’s former prime minister Carl Bildt , Chelsea Clinton , and Sweden’s leading newspaper —made clear in jabs at the president. \nTrump clarified that his comments were informed by a Fox News broadcast from Friday. My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017 \nTucker Carson’s program included a clip on from a heavily contested documentary by Ami Horowitz that attempts to draw a connection between Sweden’s intake of Syrian refugees and alleged crime in the area. But Swedish officials have said Horowitz’s claims are exaggerated and distorted . \nThat’s what prompted this tweet from the Swedish embassy. We look forward to informing the US administration about Swedish immigration and integration policies. https://t.co/x5G3euOWRh — Embassy of Sweden US (@SwedeninUSA) February 19, 2017 \nAs observers on Twitter pointed out, though, the embassy has its work cut out. Oh, @SwedeninUSA . The current administration isn't even informed on American immigration and integration policies. https://t.co/eOXiYVNAHE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:45:37.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
