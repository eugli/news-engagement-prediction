He was referring, of course, to the media — and he couldn't be more right.\nI've been saying this very thing for years, specifically with regards to women's issues. Women in the media have nothing in common with the majority of American women. The lives women in the media lead look wholly unfamiliar to the average woman, as do their politics.\nTo put this in perspective, during the 2008 election year, 1,160 employees at the three major networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS) contributed more than $1 million to Democratic candidates. By contrast, only 193 employees contributed a total of $142,863 to Republican candidates.\nThe entire worldview of the female media elite about men, sex, work, marriage, motherhood and politics is filtered through a left-wing lens. They assume the way they think is the way any normal American woman would think. \"Most journalists I've spoken to are in such a fog they don't even think of the National Organization for Women as a liberal special interest group,\" wrote Bernard Goldberg in his book, \"Bias.\"\nAs if that weren't bad enough, the female media elite also think they know what's best for women. \"Spin sisters are a Girls' Club of editors, producers, and print and television journalists with similar attitudes and opinions who influence the way millions of American women think and feel about their lives, their world, and themselves,\" writes Myrna Blyth, former editor of Ladies' Home Journal , in her book \"Spin Sisters.\"\nAnd what is the message the Spin Sisters sell? That women in America always get the short end of the stick. That they're oppressed. That their lives \"are too tough for them to handle, and they should feel very sorry for themselves,\" writes Blythe. This distorted vision of your life, she adds, \"is absolutely crazy.\"\nIndeed, which is why it fails to resonate with the majority of American women. They know the media's agenda isn't their agenda.\nUntil the media wake up to this reality, as Trump keeps trying to explain, and as the most recent Gallup polls show, the days of traditional media influence are over.\nSuzanne Venker ( @SuzanneVenker ) is a contributor to the Washington Examiner's Beltway Confidential blog.
