Jose Mourinho has no time for reputation or ability. \nApplication appears to be the only word the Portuguese manager cares about. \nThis season, the player learning that lesson hardest is Luke Shaw. Jurgen Klopp sends warning to his Liverpool flops after Leicester loss \nThe 21-year-old signed for Manchester United as one of the most highly-rated youngsters in England 18 months ago. \nBut like Casillas at Madrid and Mata at Chelsea, Shaw looks set for a long period on the sidelines if he doesn’t adapt to meet Mourinho’s demands. Mkhitaryan has earned Jose Mourinho’s trust (Getty Images) \nShaw is yet to earn Mourinho’s trust, according to Class of ’92 graduate Phil Neville, and he needs to apply himself more in order to gain it – just like Henrikh Mkhitaryan did earlier in the season. \n‘You have to train, behave and be a professional to a certain level for Mourinho,’ Neville told the Times . \n‘Luke’s obviously not doing it at a certain level consistently. The road to the EFL Cup final at Wembley Man Utd \nRound 3: Northampton (A) – 3-1 Round 4: Man City (H) – 1-0 Round 5: West Ham (H) – 4-1 SF 1: Hull City (H) – 2-0 SF 2: Hull City (A) – 1-2 Southampton \nRound 3: Crystal Palace (H) – 2-0 Round 4: Sunderland (H) – 1-0 Round 5: Arsenal (A) – 2-0 SF 1: Liverpool (H) – 1-0 SF 2: Liverpool (A) – 1-0 \n‘José speaks well of Luke, says he’s got the ability. But Luke’s going through what Henrikh Mkhitaryan went through, somebody else José didn’t really trust. José couldn’t rely on Mkhitaryan in big games, to track runs, to play as part of the team.’ \nNeville agrees that Shaw has all the ability, but says his failure to nail down a starting place has been ‘disappointing’.
