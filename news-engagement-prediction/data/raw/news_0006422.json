Larry Hogan emphasized bipartisanship in his third State of the State speech Wednesday, pressing the Democrat-controlled General Assembly to approve the most ambitious legislative agenda of his term. \nHe bypassed any mention of the political divisions roiling the country. \nInstead,... (Erin Cox) \nWhat Hogan said: \"I'm proud to report to you that Maryland has now moved into the top 10 states in the nation for overall economic performance.\" \nAnalysis: Governing magazine ranked Maryland 10th for overall economic performance in a report last August. The ranking was based on six statistics, including measures of unemployment, gross domestic product, income and job growth. \nBusiness Insider magazine, meanwhile, ranked Maryland 22nd in an analysis of state economies in January 2016. That magazine used a slightly different set of statistics including unemployment, gross domestic product, weekly wages, home prices and job growth. \nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan addressed both houses of the General Assembly. \nWhat Hogan said: \"We created more new manufacturing jobs than all the other states in the mid-Atlantic region added together.\" \nAnalysis: From January 2015 through December 2016, Maryland added 4,300 manufacturing jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The surrounding states of Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and Delaware all lost manufacturing jobs during that time period, while Delaware gained 200 manufacturing jobs. \nWhat Hogan said: \"Maryland is ranked as the fifth most innovative state in America.\" \nAnalysis: CNBC ranked Maryland as the fifth most innovative state in 2015, noting the presence of companies such as Lockheed Martin and United Therapeutics, as well as the 1,919 patents that were issued in the state. The innovation rankings were part of CNBC's larger Top States for Business study, which ranked Maryland 30th overall. \nWhat Hogan said: \"Our state has the second lowest percentage of people living below the poverty rate in the nation, and Maryland has the highest median household income in the United States of America.\" \nAnalysis: In 2015, Maryland had a poverty rate of 9.7 percent which was second lowest in the nation, according to Poverty USA, an initiative of the Catholic church that uses federal data. The national rate is 13.5 percent. The poverty threshold for a family of four is $24,250 per year. \nThere are high concentrations of poverty in parts of the state, including Baltimore city (23.6 percent), Allegany County (18.2 percent) and Wicomico County (16.7 percent), according to 2014 data compiled by the state . \nMaryland's median household income is third best in the country, according to Census data. In 2015, the state's median income was $73,594, trailing New Hampshire ($75,675) and Alaska ($75,112). \ntwitter.com/pwoodreporter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:51:07.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
