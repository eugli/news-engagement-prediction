The resulting sequined body-skimming white Calvin Klein by Appointment dress that Naomie Harris wore underscored the Belgian designer’s sophisticated yet directional approach to evening. “I was presented with the designs and they were perfect! I didn’t need to make any requests for alterations,” said the British actress. “I only ever try to please myself with what I wear. If I tried to please everyone, I’d end up not being able to choose anything!” Harris’s stylists Laura Jones and Nola Singer helped to bring the look to life, dialing up the pared-back glamour with equally simplistic, yet impactful accessories. “I started with the earrings and worked my way down,” said Jones. “I wanted the accessories to reflect the same clean lines and simple elegance of the dress.” Harris certainly doesn’t like too many bells and whistles on the red carpet, preferring simplicity over anything overly complicated. “I just like to wear clothes that are reflective of my personality,” says Harris. “I know who I am, what works on my body, and what makes me feel good.” Photo: Getty Images And what does Simons, who also dressed Harris’s Moonlight co-stars—Travonte Rhodes, Ashton Sanders, Alex R. Hibbert—all of whom play the leading character at different stages of the movie, make of the moment? “I was honored to be able to work with the cast of Moonlight and celebrate the incredible talent of each of these actors,” said the designer. For these rising stars, working with Simons was perhaps the icing on the cake of a pretty momentous season.
