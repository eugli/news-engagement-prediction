Mike Tirico is now Bob Costas — and Bob Costas is now Tom Brokaw. \nTirico will be prime-time host of the 2018 Winter Games, filling a chair held by Costas for decades. And Costas will be to NBC Sports what Brokaw is to NBC News — an eminence who appears at big events or when big news breaks or when he has something to say. \nCostas, who turns 65 next month, said a dozen Olympics — 11 as primetime host, one as late-night host — was a nice round number and that he made the decision on his own to pass the torch. Brennan: Bob Costas has been the face of the Olympics for Americans \n“It’s better to leave before they drop hints,” he said on a teleconference with Tirico. “Like, ‘Do you think it might be a good idea?’ Or, ‘Are you getting tired yet?’ Or, ‘Can we help you up the steps?’ Or, ‘Do you need another cup of Ovaltine, sir?’ I didn’t want it to get to that point. So this was entirely on my terms, and I like it that way.” \nCostas said he knew last year, even before the Rio Summer Olympic Games, that they would be his last. His bosses knew, too. They waited until Thursday, a year out from the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games, to tell the world. \n“Bob has been so gracious about all of this,” Tirico said. “How lucky am I to get this opportunity of a lifetime and have someone who I think the world of available as a resource?” \nCostas said he’d thought as long ago as 2012, when he signed what was then a new contract, that Rio could be the end of the Olympic hosting road for him. \n“And we built into the deal what they were kind enough to call ‘the Brokaw clause,’ ” Costas said. “I’m flattered by the comparison, where Tom no longer anchors the Nightly News, and hasn’t for many years, but where you still see Tom frequently on NBC when there is an event, be it historical or current, where his insider perspective would seem appropriate.” \nTirico will also take over Costas’ host duties on Football Night in America, though Costas will host the next Super Bowl as Tirico will already be in South Korea. \n“So this is something we began thinking about five years ago,” Costas said. “And the understanding was, and they were kind enough to leave it up to me: ‘If as Rio approaches or after Rio you want to continue, you go ahead. If it still feels like this is the time you want to step aside, we understand, and we’re fine with that, too.’ \n“It just felt like this was the right time. I have no misgivings about the situation. … I’m not retiring. I’m just transitioning.” \nAl Michaels, the play-by-play voice of NBC’s Sunday Night Football, spoke by satellite from Los Angeles at an NBC news conference in New York, where he lavished praise on Costas (“as fast on his feet as anyone in the television business”) and Tirico (“Mike will do a fantastic job” for Olympiads to come). \nMichaels told a story about meeting Costas at the 1983 World Series, which Michaels was broadcasting on ABC with Howard Cosell and Earl Weaver. Michaels lapsed into a dead-on imitation of Cosell in telling what Cosell said when he met Costas. \n“I know who you are. You’re the child who rhapsodizes about the infield fly rule.” \nCostas’ new role will afford him more opportunity to work baseball games for MLB Network. He isn’t a child anymore, but that just might make him feel like one. No one rhapsodizes better about baseball — or the dizzying array of sports on offer by the Games the Greeks gave us.
