It could take months or years to reach that point. \nCan Fillon survive? Image copyright Reuters Image caption Protesters banged pots and pans as Mr Fillon campaigned in the northern city of Tourcoing on Friday \nMedia reports say Mr Fillon's Welsh-born wife Penelope earned €831,400 (£710,000; $880,000) as her husband's parliamentary assistant between 1998 and 2012, and questioned how much work she had done. \nIt subsequently emerged that Mr Fillon had hired two of his children to act as lawyers, paying them €84,000 between 2005 and 2007 - when they were students. \nIn early February, he said that although what he had done was legal, French people no longer accepted the practice and that he had made a \"mistake\". \nThe controversy has hit Mr Fillon in the polls, with one new survey by Ifop for three French media outlets on Friday suggesting he is neck-and-neck with centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron. \nBut the poll places both behind the far-right's Marine Le Pen. \n\"Despite the prominence of 'PenelopeGate' in conversations in France, and the storm around his campaign, Francois Fillon has this week managed to stop the electoral haemorrhage, and even to progress a little,\" Ifop's analysis said. \nPolls indicate Mr Fillon or Mr Macron would easily beat Ms Le Pen in the second round of the election in May.
