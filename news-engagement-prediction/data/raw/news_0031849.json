Shocked by what the BBC is describing as a 'true account' viewers took to Twitter to voice their outrage over her behavior. Viewers of The Moorside were left shocked by Gemma Whelan's portrayal of Karen Matthews losing her children to social services After child pornography is discovered on her partner Craig Meehan's laptop Karen is told that her children will have to go into care but viewers remarked on her odd behavior Almost immediately afterwards Whelan's character can be seen tucking into a packet of Monster Munch Many viewers questioned what the ingredients in the packet of Monster Munch were as they seem to possess a cure all property. Some Twitter users joked that they sympathised with Karen and that they too see the Walkers crisps as high priority in their lives. Several social media users pointed out that her choice in the savoury snack might suggest something about her character. Missing: Police launched a desperate search in February 2008, after nine-year-old Shannon did not return to her home on the Moorside Estate in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire Tonight's installment of The Moorside is the final episode of the BBC drama that portrays the true story of the 'abduction' of Shannon Matthews. In February 2008, police launched a desperate search after nine-year-old Shannon did not return to her home on the Moorside Estate in Dewsbury. SHANNON MATTHEWS: A TIMELINE OF EVENTS . 19 February 2008 Shannon Matthews is last seen outside her school in Dewsbury . 20 February Police announce a massive search for the missing girl . 21 February 200 volunteers join the local police search party . 1 March Shannon's mother Karen issues an emotional public appeal for the safe return on her daughter . 12 March Reward offered for information leading to Shannon's whereabouts is increased to £50,000 . 14 March Shannon is found inside the base of a divan base at the home of Michael Donovan in Batley Carr . Over the next few weeks Donovan, along with Shannon's mother and stepfather, are all charged for separate offences . 23 January 2009 Matthews and Donovan are sentenced to eight years each of kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice A £50,000 reward was offered after Shannon disappeared and her mother made a series of emotional appeals on the television while the local community, led by Julie Bushby, played by Sheridon Smith in the drama, made extraordinary efforts of their own to find the missing schoolgirl. However, it wasn't long before doubts started to creep in regarding Karen's behaviour - and just weeks later it was revealed that her kidnap had been entirely staged. Ms Matthews admitted she arranged for the abduction to receive the reward money for finding her. Her daughter was discovered on March 14 2008 - less than a month after she was reported missing - at a house in Batley Carr, one mile from Dewsbury. The home where she was found belonged to Michael Donovan, now 49, who is the uncle of Karen Matthews' former boyfriend Craig Meehan. Matthews and Donovan were arrested and went on trial at Leeds Crown Court before being convicted of kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice. In 2008 Karen Matthews was sentenced to eight years in prison for kidnapping, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice along with Michael Donovan, the uncle of Karen's boyfriend. Shannon, who was taken into police protection and cared for by social services, is now 18 years old.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:33:57.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
