Great, let's make sure that continues to be the case.\n'Let's make sure that we go on doing trade with our biggest export market, otherwise withdrawing from the single market will be the biggest single act of protectionism in the history of the United Kingdom and no amount of trade deals with New Zealand are going to replace the trade that we do at the moment with our big European neighbours.\n'I think there are positive answers to all of these questions, I think we can achieve good trade, we can get that skilled immigration, we can have a fairer, competitive, internal economy.\n'But they are the big decisions before us.'\nIn a speech that will infuriate Leave supporters, Mr Osborne said Theresa May had huge issues to tackle in the Brexit settlement\nMr Osborne warned against harsh curbs on immigration, and said consumers would face soaring prices for years\nIn an apparent swipe at Mrs May's administration he said: 'You can produce any numbers of white papers on your industrial strategy, but unless you have answered the question 'are you going to allow, in a way that is not currently allowed, the Government to step in and provide support for an industry that has failed, which is not allowed because of state aid rules' - if you can't answer that question you haven't really gone into the meat of an industrial strategy.\n'You can have a business policy, but unless you tell the business audience the kinds of people you are going to be able to recruit and the kinds of people you are not going to be able to recruit, there is a big missing part to it.\n'I'm not surprised all these questions haven't been answered because they are very big questions and I'm not blaming the Government because these are big issues which the British government has not had to think about for a long time.'\nMr Osborne's intervention comes a day after ex Tory PM Sir John Major warned Brexit was a 'historic mistake'\nMr Osborne, the leading architect of the notorious Project Fear campaign which saw a slew of overblown warnings about the economic damage from Brexit, said the devaluation of sterling was having an impact.\nHe said: 'The country has made a decision - and I accept that decision - and we are leaving the EU.\n'There have already been some economic consequences of that - a big devaluation, and we are not going to pretend like Harold Wilson did that the 'pound in your pocket' isn't worth any less.\n'That has some benefit for exporters but it raises import prices and makes things more expensive for consumers and we are going to see that play out over the next year or two.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T20:03:42.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
