NEW DELHI: Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) shot up 5 per cent in Wednesday’s trade to hit a level last touched in June 2009. The stock logged the gains after the company said it would start charging for its 4G services from April 1, 2017. Reliance Industries investors took the announcement positively, as they had been keenly awaiting for cash flow from the multi-billion-dollar telecom venture. The move will also ease pressure on RJio’s peers. In a note, Credit Suisse said it would now be interesting to see how Reliance Jio manages the transition to paid usage, without seeing a sharp drop in subscriber base. “The next 30 days would probably be used to gauge the shift to these new price points and to market these to existing subscribers,” the brokerage said. On Wednesday, shares of Reliance Industries shot up 7 per cent to hit an eight-year high of Rs 1,166 on BSE. Shares of Bharti Airtel and Idea were trading flat to negative. Goldman Sachs said the end of free offers should mean many customers would stop using Jio as a ‘second SIM’, and return to their primary operators. “Jio’s pricing is attractive, but not overly disruptive. Jio offers Rs 303 for unlimited voice (no roaming charges) and data, compared with Rs 349 for unlimited voice and 1GB data offered by Vodafone. However, we note that the top 10 per cent of Indian mobile subscribers (who have an average Arpu of Rs 600) account for 40 per cent of industry revenues and will still find Jio offer attractive. ” Data available with Capitaline showed since September 5, 2016, the top three listed telecom players – Bharti Airtel , Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications (RCom) – have increased their top market capitalisation by 16 per cent, or about Rs 30,000 crore. This is against a 6 per cent rise in the market-cap of Reliance Industries. The gains exclude Wednesday's rally on the RIL counter. From April 1, RJio’s existing users and those coming on board in March will continue to get 1GB data a day and all of Jio apps for Rs 303 a month at a one-time cost of Rs 99. By contrast, market leader Bharti Airtel offers unlimited calls and 1GB 4G data at Rs 345 for 28 days, ET reported Airtel also offers 30GB data for 90 days at Rs 1,495. For Rs 349, rival Vodafone offers unlimited calls and 50 MB 3G or 1GB 4G data for 28 days. “The Rs 303 price point is higher than the sub-Rs 200 Arpu for leading operators, and hence the scheme is Arpu-accretive. But we would differ with this view. We actually see this plan putting an effective ‘cap’ on Arpu for all high-end subs of operators. While the Arpu for leading operators is sub-Rs 200, we believe the market is fairly highly concentrated in terms of revenue contribution. Rs 300 is pretty close to the median in terms of Arpu levels,” CS said. Brokerage Edelweiss Securities said the incumbent operators would soon realign their offerings to compete with Reliance Jio. ICICI Securities expects Jio’s total usage and tempo of subscriber addition to slow down with the end of free usage period. “Other incumbents could follow suit with respect to Jio’s pricing and control subscriber churn. We have already factored in a 6-8 per cent decline in Arpu in FY18E in te light of the ongoing tariff war. Alternatively, we could also witness a proportion of second SIM user reverting back to incumbents network one free period ends. However, we believe smaller players will find it difficult to sail through the pricing pressure and the industry would see further consolidation towards a three to four major players market,” ICICI Securities said. “The latter has set up high network capacity, banking on spectral efficiency of 4G network, which enables it to offer significantly higher benefits to consumers. We expect RJIO to maintain lower-than-incumbents prices. This is likely to lead to further pressure on realisation and subscriber acquisition costs. We will watch for stabilisation in gross subscriber addition in industry and churn ratio of incumbent operators as proxy for competitive intensity,” it said. The brokerage has ‘hold’ ratings on Bharti and Idea Cellular. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!
