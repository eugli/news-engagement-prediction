Angelo Pueblos, Samar Province Police Office intelligence chief. \nHe said combined elements of the Samar Province Public Safety Company and the Regional Public Safety Battalion in Eastern Visayas were looking for the assailants. \nLast Jan. 31, unidentified persons lobbed grenades at the two houses of the vice mayor in Barangays Mancol and Aurora, wounding two of their staff — Police Officer 1 Artemio Rebato, who was temporarily detailed at the vice mayor’s house and Jimmy Mariquit, a house cook.
