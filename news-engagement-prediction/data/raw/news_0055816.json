In her tell-all memoir released in October, the star claimed Maguire’s reaction to her pregnancy was unexpected and stated that she planned to move forward raising the child on her own. (Maguire’s lawyer countered that his client “couldn’t have been happier to find out he was the father to his son.”) \nRELATED VIDEO: Rehab Addict ‘s Nicole Curtis on Her Custody Dispute & Reliving the Struggles in Her Life \n\nAccording to Curtis, her on-again, off-again romance with Maguire ended shortly before she discovered she was pregnant. \n“I’ve had good relationships and positive experiences and I wish they were all like that,” Curtis told PEOPLE in October. “But unfortunately they aren’t.” \nMaguire filed for paternity and joint custody in December 2015, claiming that Curtis would not confirm or deny whether he was the father. A court ordered DNA test came back 99.4 percent positive, and he was awarded both, according to The Detroit News . \nCurtis tried and failed to modify the agreement so that Maguire could not have overnight custody of Harper until he’s 2 years old, telling PEOPLE she has “always been a proponent of co-parenting and children first,” but that it was “just kind of backfiring right now.” \nAt the time, Curtis also told PEOPLE she hopes to come to a resolution soon. \n“If there’s one goal that’s out there for me,” she said, “it’s that time will heal some wounds here and I can have that relationship going forward for the baby.” Show Full Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:56:02.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
