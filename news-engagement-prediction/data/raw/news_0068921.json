The advertisements include calls to dismantle the CBC , oppose the carbon tax and to screen immigrants for “anti-Canadian values.”\n“We’re running ads about screening for Canadian values and dismantling the CBC because Kellie’s been very clear that those are her policies, that when she’s prime minister she will implement,” said Michael Diamond, a spokesperson for Leitch’s campaign.\nBreitbart News, is a conservative-leaning, alt-right website founded in Los Angeles, CA in 2007 by Andrew Breitbart. Stephen Bannon, executive chairman of the website since 2012, was appointed chief strategist and senior adviser to the White House by U.S. president Donald Trump in January.\nDiamond said Leitch’s campaign is running advertisements on various websites, and Canadians read Breitbart. They’ve been running on different venues and platforms since she announced her candidacy, he said.\nArticle Continued Below Leitch has been in the race for leadership since April 2016.\n“Only people in Canada are seeing those ads,” he said.\nThe advertisements direct people to a page with a message and ask people to provide their name, phone number and email to join the Conservative Party of Canada. It reads: “Remember, you must be a member of the Conservative Party of Canada to vote for Kellie Leitch,” and asks people to “please join today.”\n“The ads just echo the statements that Kellie has been talking about throughout the campaign,” he said. \nCBC did not return calls or messages about the advertisements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:54:35.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
