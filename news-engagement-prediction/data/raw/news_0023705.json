Don’t squander your only chance to make use of it.

But you are richer than Buffett when it comes to one thing. \nTime. \nTime is literally money when you invest. The longer you have money invested, the more your investments can cash in on the concept of compound growth. Your 50 and 60-something parents would kill to have the investing runway that is still in front of you. \nTo really get your head around the power of compound growth, you need to see the numbers. Let’s say you have $1,000 to invest. And it earns 6% this year. At the end of the year your account is worth $1,060. ($1,000 x .06%) Then your account gains 6% again in year two. If you think that gets you to $1,120 you’re short-changing yourself. You earned 6% on your bigger balance of $1,060, not the original $1,000. That means you end year two with $1,123.60. \nGranted, the extra $3.60 doesn’t seem like a game changer. But when you keep at this for decades, compound growth becomes your investing bae. As your balance grows, the impact of what you earn on that balance is magnified. In fact, in just 11 years, your annual earnings are bigger than your original investment. Eventually the earnings on your earnings become bigger than your original investment. \nBuffett compares compounding to a snowball: The longer the hill you roll it down, the bigger it will grow. \nTo the Young Go the Investing Spoils \nLet’s assume you aim to sock away $5,000 a year, and your money will grow at 6% annualized rate.* \n• If you start at age 25 you will have $1.126 million by age 70. \n• If you start at age 35 you will have $591,000 by age 70. \n• If you start at age 45 you will have $291,000 by age 70. \n“You make things so much easier for yourself if you can find a way to get started saving for retirement early on,” says Luke Delorme, director of financial planning at American Investment Services. \nThink you’ll just save more each year if you get a later start? You may, but then again you may be raising a kid, or two, or more, and paying a mortgage and buying a bigger car… you get the picture. But for argument’s sake, let’s take a look at the savings rate needed to start later and end up with the same $1.126 million.
