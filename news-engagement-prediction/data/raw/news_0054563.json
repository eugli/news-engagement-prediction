The agencies have also been directed to prioritize immigrants who have committed any criminal offense, even minor infractions, whereas under the previous administration only serious and violent crimes prompted the same level of enforcement. \nMemos detailed in a USA Today report describes an unprecedented expansion of customs authority, enabling agents to “identify, capture and quickly deport every undocumented immigrant they encounter.” \nAs there are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., the implementation of President Donald Trump 's policy will necessitate a significant reallocation of federal resources: The memos call for the hiring of 10,000 more immigration agents nationwide, while the feds also intend to increase reliance on local police departments—a rebirth of the 287(g) program that languished under Obama. \nIn a conference call with New York Times reporters on Tuesday, Homeland Security officials, whom the Times granted anonymity, said the Trump policy would not affect “Dreamers,” the name for people who arrived in the U.S. illegally before their 16th birthday, and who are protected from immediate expulsion under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program.
