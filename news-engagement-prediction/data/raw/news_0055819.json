Butler/Getty Images Rob Goldberg Featured Columnist February 22, 2017 Although Magic Johnson is still getting acclimated to his new job with the Los Angeles Lakers as president of basketball operations, he is apparently trying to make a big splash before Thursday's 3 p.m. ET trade deadline. According to Sam Amick of USA Today , the Lakers are \"in the process of trying to land\" Paul George from the Indiana Pacers . He also notes the All-Star would love to sign with Los Angeles when he becomes a free agent in 2018. Mark Medina of the Los Angeles Daily News added that \"it seems more likely\" the Lakers will wait for George to hit free agency. George is averaging 22.3 points and 6.2 rebounds per game and earned his fourth career All-Star nod this season. The 26-year-old would be willing to stay in Indiana if the team remains a contender, according to Amick, but at 29-28, the squad is just in sixth place in the Eastern Conference. Although Los Angeles isn't competing for the playoffs yet, the team might not be far away with a talented young core. George could also return close to home after growing up in Palmdale, California, and going to college at Fresno State. The Lakers hired Johnson on Tuesday as the new president of basketball operations, completing an overhaul before the trade deadline as they relieved executive vice president of basketball operations Jim Buss and general manager Mitch Kupchak of their duties. As Amick noted Tuesday, the inability to bring in stars—including DeMarcus Cousins —was a big issue for team president Jeanie Buss. While Johnson already proved competency by dealing Lou Williams for Corey Brewer and a first-round pick, per Calvin Watkins of ESPN.com, adding a superstar like George would justify his presence in the front office.
