That’s down from the 39 percent level where Pew had Trump a day earlier. \nBy comparison, former President Barack Obama was tracking above 60 percent consistently through the first six months in office. At no point in his Presidency did his Gallup approval rating dip below 40 percent. \nNever in the history of the Gallup tracking poll, which dates back to 1945, has a President had an approval rating below 40 percent, or even 50 percent, in his first month. \n[image via screengrab] \nFollow Joe DePaolo (@ joe_depaolo ) on Twitter \nHave a tip we should know?
