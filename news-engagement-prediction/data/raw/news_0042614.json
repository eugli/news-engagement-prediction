Just a week after MadTree sold out of beer while celebrating the opening of its new brewery , another Cincinnati brewery is tapped out. Brink Brewing Co. at 5905 Hamilton Ave. in College Hill opened to the public on Feb. 19. After two days in business, the brewery was completely out of beer. It's closed until Friday, March 3, while it brews more. 19 photos Brink Brewing is preparing to open its taproom. Barrels used for aging brews decorate the… more “We never anticipated success like this, we are extremely grateful to all of our supporters who helped make our opening days a success,” Sarah McGarry , co-owner of Brink Brewing Co., said in a news release. “This was not an easy decision for us to make, but we feel it is extremely important to provide a high-quality tap room experience. Instead of selling one or two specialty beers, we want to make sure our inventory is full of high-quality and diverse beers.” McGarry – whose husband John McGarry serves as CEO of the brewery along with her brother Kelly Montgomery , who is its head brewer – is an interior designer in Denver by trade and handled the overhaul of the building. Brink has large garage doors that open onto the street in the front and a patio in the rear of the brewery. The building's original tin ceiling was uncovered and restored, and a brick wall was revealed to showcase the building's charm. Grainwell in Covington created the signage out of cut wood letter blocks that can be quickly moved to show what beers are on tap at the moment as an alternative to the chalkboard seen at many other breweries. Such and Such in Over-the-Rhine created the tap handles, and beetle kill pine wood from Colorado was brought in for the back wall to make a connection between the owners' two homes. One wall features a giant Scrabble board laid into it for customers to play. To heighten the community feel, a large table runs down the middle of the 3,200-square-foot brewery.
