Without the $647 million grant, Caltrain cannot give its contractors permission to begin work by the March 1 deadline in their contracts. The rail system had also ordered 16 electric trainsets from a Swiss manufacturer.

The 45-mile Caltrain corridor between downtown San Jose and downtown San Francisco produces 14 percent of California's gross domestic product, 53 percent of all California patent filings and 43 percent of all the venture capital investment in the United States. This type of step doesn’t just stall Caltrain electrification, it stalls the heart of America’s innovation economy.\" In a letter to the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board obtained by the Silicon Valley Business Journal, FTA Executive Director Matthew J. Welbes did not refer to the 14-member California Republican congressional delegation that objected to the grant in a January letter because they want to stop California's high-speed rail project. He said it was being delayed so the project could be considered in President Trump’s upcoming budget. Nevertheless, for a federal transportation grant to go through two years of favorable review and then be held up or denied is almost unprecedented. “I never imagined that the electrification of a train would be subjected to such brutal, partisan politics,” Rep. Anna Eshoo (D) said in a statement. “This is not a Democratic project nor is it a Republican project. It is about the modernization of an outdated commuter system that is the spine of the transportation system of the Peninsula and the Silicon Valley region. This project has met every requirement of the Department of Transportation including planning, environmental approval, broad community support and strong local funding, including citizens taxing themselves. The only requirement it didn’t meet was a political one.” Murphy said “every other project that has met all those requirements and reached the stage where ours is now has received an FFGA (full funding grant agreement). If for some reason we were not to receive an FFGA, we would be the first project that has met all the requirements to do so.” The GOP congressional letter opposed a grant to the California High-Speed Rail Authority , which the signers wish to shut down. High-speed rail is to eventually share Caltrain’s tracks between San Jose and San Francisco. However, it was Caltrain that applied for the grant — high-speed rail is not funded by the Federal Transit Administration — and the grant would complete the funding package for a project that was originally conceived before the state’s high-speed rail authority was created. It would boost speed and capacity along the Caltrain corridor for a system that is already overcrowded with commuters. \"For well-meaning people to believe they can stop high-speed rail through this action, if they were aiming for high-speed rail they barely grazed it, but they may have delivered a mortal blow to a project that is critical to the economic well-being of Silicon Valley,\" Guardino said.
