Michael Shear – St Ambrose's School, Newmarket \nMr Shear swapped his job as an insurance officer 15 years ago for a life of worm farms and sports ovals. \n\"It was just not me and when I started here I just loved getting out of bed every day. \n\"It's the best job ever; every part of it has been great. \n\"It's one of those luck jobs that you can get.\" \nHe said each day was different. \n\"The fun part is never knowing what's going to come up during the day. \n\"I start at 6:30am and I clean up from the day before and then things come up like leaking air-cons or bins.\" \nSeeing the children start school and grow up is also an enjoyable part of the job for Mr Shear. \n\"I call all the boys 'sir' and all the girls 'miss',\" he said. \n\"Years later you see the kids grown up and how they turn out so great ... that's really good.\" Len Moss – St Mary MacKillop Primary School, Birkdale \nWith more than 600 students at the school where Mr Moss works, remembering names is a daily challenge. \n\"I can remember a few of the names but it's hard to catch them all. I don't know how the teachers do it.\" \nMr Moss was an electrician for 30 years before he turned to groundskeeping. \n\"You have variety and it's great to have the kids around as they always want to say hello and see what you're doing. \n\"At Christmas time many of the parents give me presents — so you know you're doing something right.\" \nEach day Mr Moss can be seen mowing and cleaning. \n\"I do anything and everything from hedging to cleaning up after a kid that has been sick. Photo: Flowers and hedges are all part of the school yard gardens that the groundskeepers tend too. (ABC Radio Brisbane: Jessica Hinchliffe) \n\"I like to walk around the school seeing what you've done and what you've changed. \n\"Being part of the community is a big part of it ... I'll keep going for as long as my body lets me.\" Robert Miles – Holland Park State School \nFor Mr Miles, his daily mission is to keep the grounds, the parents, the teachers and the children happy. Photo: Rob Miles enjoys seeing the difference he makes to the school community. (ABC Radio Brisbane: Jessica Hinchliffe) \n\"I'm surprised when the kids notice the grounds so much, it helps me not see the hills so steep at the end of the day. \n\"I think I made a difference to the school from the minute I put the first plant in the ground. \n\"I love creating the beautiful gardens and being able to make the place look better.\" \nMr Miles, who was previously a musician, has looked after the grounds at Holland Park for the past eight years. \n\"I think this jobs suits me and the hills keep me thin. \n\"Every day is a new challenge and you never know what's going to happen. \n\"The biggest thing about the job is that you just have to keep at it and eventually you'll get there.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:30:26.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
