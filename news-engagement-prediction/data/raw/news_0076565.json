I refer to the country's reputation in terms of the transparency and the integrity of our institutions,\" he said. \nMr Borg told the prime minister the chamber was \"duty-bound\" to raise the issue as it had a bearing on local businesses' economic interests. We express our utmost concern about issues of good governance \n\"The chamber cannot shy away from its responsibilities to express its utmost concern about the issues of good governance we are allowing to consistently persist,\" he said. \nClearly, Mr Borg added, Malta's international reputation had suffered, as could the island's future economic stability if the situation continued to deteriorate. \nHe referred to a recent attractiveness survey, which reported a 15 per cent drop over 2015 in the perception of Malta's political stability and regulatory transparency. \nMalta, he warned, had also dropped 10 places to its lowest ever ranking in an international corruption index, issued by Transparency International. \nReplying, Dr Muscat attempted to quell the chamber's concerns, insisting businesses did not invest in corrupt countries. Investment, he said, had been attracted to the island, and was still being attracted. \nMuch of the chamber president's remaining speech provided a wish-list of condominium and social policies, especially concerns over the impact of a blanket increase in minimum wages. Dr Muscat assured those present the government would foot the cost of an increase this year with the social partners brought in to try and reach a consensus. \nDr Muscat stressed the government was committed to finding a positive deal for Air Malta, while on energy, he warned that messing with the current plan would see Malta's economy drop back to square one. « €1.4bn in state aid for power station company Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=5377353401&n=281279d8' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=5377353401&n=281279d8' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:50:01.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
