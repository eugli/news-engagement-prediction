SIGN UP NOW > media_camera Tim Taranto was the first player picked by the Giants during last year’s draft. \nIn their place, the Giants could be forced to lean on several youngsters plucked from the draft or the club’s academy — should injury strike at any stage throughout the year. \nIt’s by no means a death sentence for the team’s flag chances — just look at how some of those kids played in last weekend’s clash with West Coast. \nTim Taranto, claimed with Pick 2 in last year’s national draft, racked up 21 disposals to go with six clearances and seven inside 50s in an impressive display on his unofficial debut. \nWill Setterfield and Harry Perryman were also sound across the field, while 2015 academy recruit Matthew Kennedy (22 disposals and five inside 50s) was one of the team’s best. \nLachie Tiziani, taken with Pick 54 last year, also showed promising glimpses of his talent. \nHowever, such a reliance on youngsters for a side competing for a flag is less than ideal. \nTo put it into perspective, the Bulldogs rotated 39 players through its best team throughout its 2016 campaign — four more than the bulging Giants used. \nConsidering that squad has been shaved further this year, it could be a headache for Cameron. \n“The fact remains — and we saw this last year — you only have to beat the Giants on one day,” Watson added on Wednesday. \n“You don’t have to beat them 22 times over the course of the year. You just have to do what the Bulldogs did last year — get your match-ups right, get your planning right, nullify their strengths, play through your strengths — and you’re capable of winning. \n“I don’t subscribe to this theory that everyone is playing for positions outside of the flag next year.” \nGiven the Giants have the third-most experienced list in terms of games played (average of 76) and the second-oldest squad (average of 24y 219d), the disparity in age profile between the best 22 and those waiting in the wings is large. \nBut will it prove a hindrance for the flag favourites? Or will those youngsters just add to the increasing likelihood of a Giants dynasty?
