(Dixie D. Vereen/For The Washington Post) Although the chef of the romantic Iron Gate says his restaurant has enjoyed a respectable three years in Dupont Circle, Tony Chittum concedes that its original format — different menus depending on where you were sitting — confused some diners.\nHe thinks he has solved the problem, even as options at Iron Gate have grown. As of this month, patrons can order from an a la carte menu, a tasting menu or a family-style plan and can eat wherever they want within the historic restaurant: the bar, patio or rear dining room.\n“We want to make everyone who comes through the door happy,” says Chittum.\nCount me pleased with the chef’s new, six-course, Italian-leaning tasting menu, a $90 spread that’s best taken in the cozy dining room with its burgundy banquettes, open kitchen and live fire. The evening unfolds like a good novel as smoked polenta tortellini segues to cod in a circle of saffron mussels and moves to crimson hanger steak: bison served as a garland with beets that are alternately roasted, pickled and raw. Everything about the repast — the flatbread we can’t stop inhaling, the wines washed back with interesting backstories, the chocolate budino that ends the meal on a sigh — makes you want to revisit it.\nSmoked Polenta Tortellini with trumpet mushrooms, quail egg and winter truffle at Iron Gate. (Dixie D. Vereen/For The Washington Post) Another night, more fun: dinner composed from among a dozen or so small plates, an outing enjoyed on the brick courtyard separating the front bar (love the vaulted ceiling) from what was once the chef’s tasting room.\nHummus made from pureed shell beans, zapped with harissa oil and scooped up with house-baked fennel crackers, would be good anywhere. It doesn’t hurt that I’m eating the snack beneath grapevines strung with white lights and beside a glowing fire pit. Risotto flush with toasted hazelnuts, fried rosemary and cremini mushrooms, smoky from their time in a wood oven, keeps me in my seat. Will the next dish compare as favorably? House-made cotechino fanned over a salad of lentils, creamy with tahini, is every bite as delicious, and I love the pork sausage’s sly heat, from crushed red pepper flakes.\nThe one dish a companion and I fail to finish is squid stuffed with feta on a pool of too-sweet mustard cream. But the backdrop, including pots of herbs gracing the fence and some Michael Jackson tunes, makes up for the small slip. It’s February, and we’re dining alfresco!\n“As much as I would like winter to be winter,” says Chittum, “the weather has been good for business.”\nThe only time I struck out at Iron Gate, part of the Neighborhood Restaurant Group, was the night I asked about the family-style spread and was told a minimum of four people had to order it. My party was one person short. So I can tell you only that the menu costs $55 a person for four courses, starting with shared hot and cold antipasti, continuing with pasta and a main course and ending with dessert. Earlier this week, the lot included rigatoni with smoked mushrooms, roast pork loin, and zabaglione with compressed apple. (In a follow-up phone conversation, Chittum said exceptions could be made for groups of fewer than four.)\nThe new format at Iron Gate is liberating. No longer is the crackle limited to the fires.\n1734 N St. NW. 202-524-5202. irongaterestaurantdc.com .
