Yle picked out six key points in the government's report ranging from higher troop levels to closer cooperation with Sweden. Image: Tommi Pesonen / Yle \nSix key points in the Defence Policy Report publish on Thursday provide an overview of how the government sees the nation's defence and how it plans to make improvements. 1) Troop strength \nTotal wartime strength of Finland's Defence Forces will rise to 280,000 troops. At present wartime strength is set at 230,000. \n\"The increase is moderate. It is around 20 percent and basic equipment for these troops already exists,\" Defence Minister Jussi Niinistö stated at a press conference on Thursday. \nThe emphasis will be on developing the army and cross-services rapid reaction units. 2) Billions for arms procurement \nAccording to the report, Finland has two major upcoming procurement projects: new fighter aircraft and new naval ships. Thursday's report contained little new information about plans to purchase new jet fighters. \nThe Air Force's Hornets will be reaching the end of their operational lifetime during the years 2025-2030, and a replacement is to be introduced beginning in 2025. The cost of the project is estimated at 7-10 billion euros. A decision on what aircraft will replace the Hornets will be made under a new government sometime in the early 2020s. \nThe Navy should replace its Rauma-class missile boats and Hämeenmaa-class minelayers. Altogether seven ships are to be decommissioned after they reach the end of their service life in the mid-2020s. \nFour new vessels to replace those taken out of service carry a total price tag of 1.2 billion euros.

They said that there are no indications within the Russian leadership of a desire to meddle with Finland's status.

In addition to the EU, NATO and the United States, Niinistö also referred to Sweden. \n\"The defence system will be developed in such a manner as not to create any practical impediments to possible membership in a military alliance,\" he stated. \nFinland will continue training and exercises with other Nordic countries. No predetermined limits will be set on deepening bilateral defence cooperation with Sweden, and this could even mean exercising \"collective self-defence\", as stated in the report.
