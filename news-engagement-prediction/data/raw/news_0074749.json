(ABC North Coast: Samantha Turnbull) Volunteers pose biggest challenge \nAbout 80 per cent of the clubs that had responded so far reported their biggest challenge as attracting and keeping volunteers. \nReasons given for the problem were: the modern pace of life, as per longer working hours and more demands on time; low income and single parent families with little free time; onerous regulations and requirements for volunteers; community apathy; parents focused on their own children and not wanting to miss out on their games; and older committee members out of touch with younger generations. \nNew South Wales Country Rugby League (NSWCRL) vice president Doug Harrison called for volunteer regulations to be relaxed.

(ABC North Coast: Samantha Turnbull) \n\"To be a volunteer now you have to have some sort of certificate just to say you can put the goal posts up on the field,\" he said. \n\"People have been doing it for years, so now it's an extra weight on volunteers' shoulders and if we could ease that weight we could have more volunteers coming into the game.\" \nSummit ambassador and former NRL and international coach Brian Smith said volunteers needed to be valued as the most important part of any club. \n\"The corner stone of rugby league clubs are volunteers and if you get high quality volunteers who love their club and love what they do they are the people that everyone remembers,\" he said. \n\"They belong to that club, they are gold, they are the nuggets, they are the people who are the rock you build your club around. \n\"They're also the people who stay with a club for the long-term — longer than the players, the coaches, the managers.\" Players and sponsors hard to attract \nAbout 70 per cent of the clubs surveyed reported difficulties in attracting and keeping players. \nReasons listed for problems attracting players were: player remuneration, players wanting too much or over-valuing their worth; competition from other sports and larger clubs; lack of local employment opportunities for players; club amenities not attractive to players; and problems attracting junior players. Photo: NRL's Kelvin Menchin (L) says many clubs are already changing their practices. (ABC North Coast: Samantha Turnbull) \nNRL game development officer Kelvin Menchin said struggling clubs should look to those that were already working to address the problems with player retention. \n\"Clubs are trying to adjust to suit the community by running their competitions at different times, day or night,\" he said. \n\"I think checks and balances in your club or league are important to make sure people involved have a pathway. \n\"When people can see a pathway they're willing to persist on.\" \nAbout 70 per cent of the clubs surveyed also reported difficulties in attracting sponsorship. \nReasons listed were: two teams in one town; club reputation and community perceptions; negative perceptions about rugby league in general; juniors shifting to rugby union; lack of facilities; and minimal returns on investment. Cultural shift needed \nCountry Rugby League East Coast regional area manager Kevin Hill said most of the issues raised in the survey and at the summit came back to club culture. \n\"The big shift that changed the game was when a lot of money came into the game at the NRL level, and it was all about going to the players and not the community,\" he said. \n\"Country football has followed that trend but the difference is that country football is about community. \n\"We've got caught up in it — being about the player before the community — so things like building clubhouses and amenities have taken a backseat to paying for players. \n\"If you're going to be long-term successful as a club, it needs to be about your culture. \n\"The club has to be more important than any player ... it is a game and the reason it was established was to give communities an identity.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:56:10.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
