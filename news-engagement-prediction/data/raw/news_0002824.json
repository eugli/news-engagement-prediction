Not surprisingly, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin have been some of the most reliable votes for Trump nominees. \nBut for Democrats eyeing a challenge to Trump in 2020, a long string of votes against Trump's nominees can be touted as evidence of their commitment to oppose the president from day one. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, seen as a top-tier White House contender, has voted against all but one of his nominees. \nFor others, their votes are determined by the nominee and position in question. Across the board, however, Democrats seem to have stepped up their opposition to Trump and his nominees this week, as reflected in the growing number of \"nay\" votes. \nNBC News will update this list as the Senate takes further confirmation votes.
