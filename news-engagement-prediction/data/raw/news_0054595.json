The college’s hospital too wears a deserted look, affecting students’ practical training. \nAlso read | Classes stay suspended at Gian Sagar medical college as faculty’s salary stir still on \nOn Wednesday, a delegation of students met state director, medical education and research, Dr Sujata Sharma and said that the problem was more serious for first-year medical students who will have exams in May. \nLast year too, students faced suspension of classes for almost three months after faculty went on strike for delay in salaries. \nThe college is governed by family members of Pearls Group boss Nirmal Singh Bhangoo, who currently faces several charges in a Rs 45,000-crore ponzi scheme scam. \nSecretary, medical education, Vikas Pratap said that the department will not let the students suffer again in the dispute between faculty and management. “The management has been called for a meeting to end the current deadlock and also finding a permanent solution to the college’s financial crisis. Faculty and students will also attend the meeting.” \nHe added, “We will scrutinise whether the management fulfilled assurances of last year.” \nThe faculty have alleged that the management did not keep any of its last year’s assurances, including opening a separate fund of students’ tuition fees that was to be used to pay staff regularly. “We have no idea where the management is taking the crores being collected from students. It is better if the government takes over its financial matters, said one of the protesters who did not want to be expressly named. \nA final-year MBBS student of the college, Akashdeep Singh, said, “We want a permanent solution to this issue as we can’t tolerate our classes being suspended time and again.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:26:39.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
