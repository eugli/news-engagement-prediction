Despite this, on March 29, 2016 it asked Treasury to transfer R55 million to drought relief from within its own unspent budget funds from a different programme.\nThe request was denied by Treasury on the basis that it was viewed as fiscal dumping, and because it exceeded the allowable amount for a normal virement or intra-department transfer.\nThe request had also been made without any business plans that detailed how the money would be used.\nCogta spokesperson Lennox Mabaso declined to comment, saying the department would brief the committee first in a meeting at a date that had been scheduled, before speaking to the media.\nDA spokesperson on Cogta George Mari said the revelation meant Cogta MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube was sitting on “almost R200 million in drought relief funding as people suffer”.\n“If ever there was a tale of an uncaring ANC, this is it. The failure to ensure that drought relief is rolled out in the province is also indicative of the worst kind of ineptitude.\n“Not only does it show the complete incompetence of officials themselves, it also shows just how out of touch the MEC is with what is happening in her own department … funding was allocated directly to her department by KZN Treasury specifically for drought relief — R33 million last year and R150 million this year. The lack of expenditure falls squarely at her feet and she should hang her head in shame.\n“MEC Dube-Ncube must explain why she and her department failed the people of our province in their hour of need,” he said.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=433320100&t=artid%3d57219685-970e-4c1d-bcff-acc9bb70ec23%26Companies%3dcogta%26Places%3dpietermaritzburg%26Topics%3ddrought%26accreditation%3dthe+witness%26posno%3d1", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=433320100&t=artid%3d57219685-970e-4c1d-bcff-acc9bb70ec23%26Companies%3dcogta%26Places%3dpietermaritzburg%26Topics%3ddrought%26accreditation%3dthe+witness%26posno%3d1"], "published": "2017-02-27T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:05:55.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
