But just because he’s a nice guy doesn’t mean he holds back during a fight scene. At least that’s what his John Wick: Chapter 2 co-stars say. Common and Ruby Rose told Yahoo Movies what it’s like to fight Reeves. “I got a little elbow from Keanu,” Rose said. “He was flipping me over his shoulder and he put the elbow out. But I loved it.”\nCommon and Ruby Rose told Yahoo Movies about what it was like taking hits from Keanu Reeves. (Photo: Yahoo Movies) More John Wick might hit anybody who comes his way, but Rose says Reeves is quite different. “He’s such a gentle … he wouldn’t hurt a fly,” Rose claimed. “And so he was like, ‘Are you OK, are you OK?’ I’m like, ‘I’m fine, I’m fine.’ And then I’m like, ‘Play [the video] back!’ As long as you could see it, and there’s, like, in slow -o and I’m like [ makes pained expression ].

It was intense and we were going at it. Not to hurt each other, but it’s like, ‘Man, I’m about to deliver.’ … I don’t think he would hurt a woman, but he’s a warrior.”\nDon’t be fooled: Keanu Reeves hits hard, according to Common. (Photo: Niko Tavernise) More Common didn’t mind the pain and knew everyone else was getting bruised up. “He kept blocking me in that same spot, and the next day, my arm was blue,” he said. “And I was like, ‘Who can I tell?’ Nobody cares!”\nKeanu Reeves Wanted to Do Passengers For ‘Years and Years and Years’ Before Chris Pratt Was Cast: \nTell us what you think!
