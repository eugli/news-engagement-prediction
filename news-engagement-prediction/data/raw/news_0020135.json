Declan was loved and known by so many people. \n\"I have taken great comfort knowing that Declan has donated his organs to a few recipients that are in great need of them. \n“It was his last wish to donate and has been carried out in accordance with his wishes. Declan has given people the gift of life today.“Thank-you for all your thoughts, prayers and wishes.” Share ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:19:06.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
