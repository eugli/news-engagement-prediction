There's not very much to do around here so we had gone for a drive. 'We had just come past Kinnordy and we saw this big sort of animal in the road. Ross and his friends saw the brown creature on the side of the road and decided to see what it was 'We thought it was a big cat or something so we got out and that's when I started videoing. 'All of a sudden Shaun was like, 'It's a platypus‎!' but we knew it was a beaver.' 'He's a wee bit simple sometimes. 'It was big, about three and a half feet long. It was about 25 or 30 kilos, you wouldn't want to go up against it. Ross said the animal was about 30kilos and he would not want to have fought it. It isn't clear what provoked the animal 'I wouldn't want to fight with it, not at all. It would chew your leg off. 'I was trying to get closer to it and then it just started looking at me and growling and that was when it jumped. It was making this sort of a hissy growl noise. 'It all happened pretty ‎quickly. It was pretty scary. ' The footage, just 14 seconds long, shows the beaver walking along a single track country road on a balmy spring afternoon. As the group of friends get nearer, it moves onto the grass verge. The young men's voices can be heard saying: 'Is it a platypus?' and, 'What's it doing here?' before the animal dramatically leaps towards the camera, hissing and baring its teeth. ‎Screams and then whoops of laughter are then heard as the three friends beat a hasty retreat towards their vehicle. Mr Smith reported that the beaver did not appear unduly stressed by its brush with humanity. He said: 'We ran away back to the car and it just continued doing its thing. 'It started keeping itself to itself again and just carried on walking down the side of the road. 'When I told my family and showed them the video they thought it was hilarious.' He added: 'It was funny, it was scary, it was just a bit weird as well. 'We weren't expecting it at all. Especially in broad daylight, you wouldn't expect to see a beaver walking about.' Animal experts have warned that these animals should not be approached and provoked. Ross wasn't hurt in the incident, but others have been in similar attacks Although the encounter ended without injury, there could have been much more serious consequences. In 2013, a 60-year old ex-serviceman in Belarus bled to death after a beaver bit through a main artery in his leg. He had been trying to have his photograph taken alongside the creature whilst out on a fishing trip with two friends. That attack also happened during daylight hours. Dr Göran Hartman, a senior lecturer at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala, is one of the world's most respected academic experts on beavers. He said: 'All animals get scared when cornered and all animals with teeth will, in that situation, try to use them. 'Show the beaver some respect and keep a distance. Don't try to pick them up. 'If they bite it's going to hurt of course, definitely. If you come across one, stay a few metres away, and if the animal gets nervous, increase the distance. 'Beavers usually active in the night, evenings and early mornings. 'I would expect an animal like this was a sub adult, a two year old, just having a look about. Regarding the likelihood of them harming the public, he said: 'It is rare, I wouldn't say they are aggressive animals. But I wouldn't go around patting a strange dog either.' Beavers were formally recognised as a native species in Scotland in December last year, following a long running campaign by environmentalists. A £4m official trial at Knapdale forest in Argyll was overshadowed by illegal releases and escapes from private collections in Tayside. Beavers have been blamed for flooding and their presence remains controversial due to damage to farmland and mature woodland in the area.
