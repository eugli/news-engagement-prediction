That equates to 20 billion capsules containing aluminium or plastic being produced every year – enough to circle the earth 14 times over. Nespresso says the key to keeping coffee fresh is making sure oxygen does not get to it. It says, encasing it in an aluminium pod is said to be the most effective way of doing that. Some 22per cent of households own a coffee pod machine. In the last year, more than £112m-worth of coffee pods were sold in the UK, up by a third from 2014. Sales are expected to treble by 2020, at which point coffee capsule sales are projected to overtake those of tea bags. A huge amount of energy is used to refine the aluminium used to make the capsules from raw bauxite, a process that produces a lot of toxic waste The success of Nespresso has a great deal to do with the popularity of actor, campaigner and brand ambassador George Clooney. A major supporter of human rights groups and charities, he is also something of a green campaigner which has involved, among other things, switching to using his own electric cars. The actor appeared on the first ‘green’ issue of Vanity Fair, along with Julia Roberts, Al Gore and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Halo cofounder, Nils Leonard, Nils Leonard, said: ‘We believe that the major coffee companies aren’t doing enough to combat waste, so if they won’t, we will. ‘We want to set a new standard for coffee capsules and in a year we will have forced the whole industry to change. The capsules, which have been designed by the start-up company Halo, are compatible with the Nespresso machines advertised by the US movie star. They are made from a natural mix of fibres, including bamboo and paper ‘For the first time, Kopi Luwak, the world’s finest and rarest coffee will be available in a capsule for coffee lovers to enjoy with the knowledge that every cup isn’t harming the planet - and we’ve only just started.’ Fellow co-founder, Richard Hardwick, said: ‘The coffee revolution has happened and one of the key challenges the industry now faces is the millions of tonnes of waste created as a result. ‘Aluminium and plastic coffee capsules are difficult to recycle so most of them end up in the bin, and that’s why up to 75per cent are currently being sent to landfill every minute. Most people don’t understand the irreversible damage these coffee capsules are inflicting on the planet. ‘It’s a design challenge that no-one has cracked. Until now. Creating Halo pushed expert capsule designers and coffee roasters to the limit, combining cutting edge innovation and modern materials with traditional craft.’ Nespresso says the key to keeping coffee fresh is making sure oxygen does not get to it. It says, encasing it in an aluminium pod is said to be the most effective way of doing that However, the price of being green does not come cheap. Nespresso capsules are generally 30p-40p each, while the premium coffee pods offered by Halo work out at £1 each. Nespresso, the most popular provider of the pods in Europe, first sold single-serving coffee pods in 1986. The company says the fact they are made of aluminium, which can be repeatedly recycled, means they are actually a green option. A spokesman said: ‘Aluminium provides significant environmental advantages. ‘It has the unique advantage of being infinitely recyclable and eliminates the need for any additional packaging or overwrap to protect freshness. ‘We are frequently asked whether individual portions and the use of aluminium contradict sustainability - in our opinion, the opposite is the case.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:37:10.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
