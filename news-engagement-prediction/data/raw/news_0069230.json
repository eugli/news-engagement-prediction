The group’s Toronto and York Region chapter has announced an investment of $87 million for local charities and community services for 2017-2018.\nIt’s the largest such allocation of funds that United Way Toronto and York Region has ever made, topping last year’s commitment by $1 million.\n“We’re excited to serve the current needs of our region and its growing and diversifying needs,” said Daniele Zanotti, president and CEO of United Way Toronto and York Region.\nWith the bulk of its contribution — over $62 million — the United Way will bolster its ongoing support of over 220 local agencies, including the March of Dimes, YMCA of Greater Toronto, Big Brothers and Big Sisters of Toronto, the Canadian National Institute for the Blind and a wide array of housing services and shelters.\n  Over $3.4 million will go to the United Way’s Building Strong Neighbourhoods Strategy, which includes vital Community Hub projects in some of Toronto’s most in-need areas.\nThe hubs are spaces where members of a community can access social services, participate in health or nutrition programs and gather together for celebrations or community meetings.\nOver the course of the past decade, more than a million people have accessed services through these hubs.\n“This funding is going to continue to leverage that work, to ensure that we’re reaching all the residents that we should be, and making sure as we do our work we’re coordinated,” said Deb Shime, United Way of Toronto and York Region’s senior vice-president of Community Impact.\nAnother $3.1 million will be diverted to the United Way’s Youth Success Strategy, helping young people in need complete applications for post-secondary education, access training programs and networking opportunities and, ultimately, find meaningful employment.\nIn addition to the influx of funds, the United Way is welcoming new charitable actors into their fold.\nThe United Way Toronto and York Region announced new partnerships with 62 organizations that provide broad, multi-faceted services in the region. Called “anchor” agencies, these groups will be assisted by the United Way in their advocacy, policy and fundraising work.\nAmong the organizations being invited to become United Way partners are the Canadian Hearing Society, COSTI Immigrant Services and Carefirst Seniors and Community Services Association.\nAnd, for groups that do not have a formal partnership with the United Way, there is an upcoming process through which organizations can apply for three-year funding.\n“We want to make sure that we’re serving the community better,” Shime said. “Really, at the end of the day, we are looking at how we make a difference in people’s lives and how the organizations that we’re funding do that work.”\nThe expansion of funding and partnerships is representative of the broadened scope United Way was hoping for when its Toronto and York Region chapters merged two years ago, said Zanotti.\n“We came together in 2015 with a commitment to do more and better in our region,” he added.\nThat goal became a reality in part because of a stellar year for donations.\nUnited Way Toronto and York Region’s 2016 fundraising campaign collected $102 million, more than any other United Way chapter.\nBut there is always room for more contributions, of money or of time, said Zannotti.\n“We love to have residents and community groups donate,” he said. “Whether that’s through donors or volunteers, we would love for people to get involved with us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:08:58.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
