José Andrés—a popular immigrant chef from Spain who has been feuding with Trump ever since he backed out of opening up a restaurant in Trump's luxury hotel in downtown Washington, DC—announced that he'd be shuttering all of his restaurants in the nation's capitol and the surrounding areas for the day. In support of our people & #ADayWithoutImmigrants Thurs 2/16 we will not open @jaleo DC CC MD, @zaytinya or @oyameldc #ImmigrantsFeedAmerica — José Andrés (@chefjoseandres) February 14, 2017 \nThe strike mirrors Milwaukee 's Day Without Latinos, Immigrants, and Refugees protest on February 13, when thousands of immigrants in the Wisconsin city refused to work and instead took to the streets to protest Trump and Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. (Clarke Jr. recently made comments about helping federal agents crackdown on immigrants.) \"No matter what status you have, we're here to work hard,\" Mayra Estrada, a 33-year-old protester, told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel . \"And we're not taking anybody's job, we're doing our job.\" \nA Day Without Immigrants is centered in DC, but the Washington Post is reporting that immigrants across the country are planning to take part as well. The strikes, which are intended to show how economically paralyzed communities would be without immigrants, come on the heels of several high-profile raids last week. Nearly 700 undocumented immigrants , including a \"DREAMer\" granted temporary legal status under DACA , were arrested in sweeps that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials called \"routine.\" On Twitter , Trump referred to the sweeps as a \"crackdown.\" Get the scoop, straight from Mother Jones.
