Yes, whether it’s a war with Luxembourg or replacing textbooks in public schools with discounted Ivanka Trump blouses, The Onion will be providing “real-time, running commentary throughout the President’s speech and the Democratic response through a series of on-screen graphics” on its The Onion Presents Trump’s Address to Congress special on Fusion. \nOnion superfans may recall that we previously ran a special on Fusion called The Onion Presents: The Iconic Images of Election 2016, but that was back when we still thought hope was possible, and besides it wasn’t live. This one, meanwhile, is live, and will begin on Fusion tomorrow night at 9:00 p.m. ET. \n[ Note: In case you haven’t put it together yet, Fusion, like The Onion and The A.V. Club, is owned by Univision Communications .] \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:19:54.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
