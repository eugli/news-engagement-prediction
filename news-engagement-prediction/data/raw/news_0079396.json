NIÑO JESUS ORBETA / Philippine Daily Inquirer \nPresidential Commission on the Urban Poor (PCUP) chairman Terry Ridon on Tuesday urged the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to exercise some consideration for drivers and operators following Monday’s transport strike against the proposed modernization program that has affected thousands of commuters. \n“As the agency mandated to serve as the direct link between the urban poor and the national government bodies, we come to the defense of drivers and operators who as informal workers comprise a large part of the urban poor sector,” Ridon said in a statement. \n“At the center of the issue is whether there are alternative livelihood opportunities for all affected drivers and operators which are either equivalent to or better than what they have at the moment, income-wise,” he added.
