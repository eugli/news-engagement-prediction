(The Baltimore Sun) \nAfter Perry's game-changing overtime dunk, the rest of the overtime had little flow, with most of the time spent at the free-throw line. The Clippers struggled mightily from there, going 13-for-29 in the game and missing their first six in overtime. \nPoly's overtime lead would grew to 52-44 with 1:26 left before the Clippers climbed back to give themselves a chance. A 3-pointer from Byron Easter cut the lead to 52-49 with 1:04 left, but the Engineers kept the lead with free throws down the stretch. \nPoly coach Sam Brand wasn't surprised to see Perry up for the challenge in the game's biggest moments. \n\"He's our senior leader and we'll win or lose by what he does, and he did what everybody in this gym was waiting for him to do. He did it at the right time and that's what big-time players do. He's a big-time player, and that's a big-time play,\" Brand said. \nIn the first half, Patterson jumped out to a 14-4 lead before the Engineers dominated the second quarter with a 14-0 run to help take a 22-20 halftime lead. A 3-pointer from Seth Jones in the closing seconds of the third quarter gave the Engineers the 35-30 lead going into the fourth. \nPatterson coach Harry Martin said poor execution at the offensive end and the misses at the foul line were most costly. The Clippers have shot 60 percent from the line this season. Both team are already looking forward to the city championship game — set for Feb. 18 at Coppin State Univeristy. \n\"It was just a complete, competitive battle the whole game,\" Martin said. \"Both teams laid it all out there. \n\"The good thing about it in terms of being able to see them again, it will be more like a chess match going into the second game. You going into the first game expecting to see things and then you see other things and can make the adjustments the second time around. It should be another even game and come down to who makes shots.\" \ntwitter.com/GlennGrahamSun \n4 Poly 54, 2 Patterson 51 (OT) \nPA – Price 22, Mungo 7, Adams 7, Clemons 5, Jones 7, Easter 3 . \nTotals: 17 13-29 51. \nPO – Perry 21, Mims 10, Ali 9, Mosley 3, Jones 7, Walker 4. \nTotals: 19 12-20 54.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:28:55.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
