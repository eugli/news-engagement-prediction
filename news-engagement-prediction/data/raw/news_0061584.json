Those that didn't could have risked federal funding. \nThat guidance was never truly implemented, as an August court ruling temporarily stayed its implementation until a lawsuit from 13 states against it could be resolved. \nThe Trump administration's decision to scrap the move seems to go against what Trump himself declared during the campaign. The move goes against what President Trump had declared on the campaign trail, when he suggested North Carolina's restrictive bathroom laws were dumb. (Elaine Thompson/AP) \nTrump said last April that North Carolina was paying a \"big price\" for its law that banned municipalities from allowing transgender individuals to use public bathrooms, and suggested it was a dumb law. \n\"There have been very few complaints the way it is. People go. They use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate,\" Trump said on NBC’s “Today” show. \n“There has been so little trouble. And the problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife and the economic — I mean, the economic punishment that they're taking.” Sean Spicer argued transgender bathroom use should be a \"states' rights\" issue. (Andrew Harnik/AP) \nBut it's in line with Trump's other moves to cozy up to religious conservatives throughout his campaign and presidency — and comes ahead of a Supreme Court case slotted for March involving a transgender teenager who was denied bathroom access in Virginia. \nTexas transgender bathroom law could hurt NYC's pension fund \nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer argued that whether schools allow transgender people to use the bathrooms that match their gender should be a \"states' rights\" issue, while downplaying the import of the move. \n\"It's not a priority. There's a case pending in the Supreme Court in which we have to decide whether or not to continue to issue guidance to the court. It's dictated by that,\" he said Wednesday. \"It's incumbent on us to actually follow the law and to recognize that Title IX never actually talked about this.\" The plan lines up with Trump's other moves to win over religious conservatives throughout his campaign and presidency. (Olivier Douliery / POOL/EPA) \nThe pending decision reportedly caused major friction within the administration. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos opposed it, disagreeing with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and had to be pressed to support the decision by Trump himself, according to the New York Times. The administration reportedly will leave in place anti-bullying measures, at DeVos' behest. \nLGBTQ advocates decried the move. \nTexas man accused of molesting young boys in church bathroom \n\"What could possibly motivate a blind and cruel attack on young children like this?\" Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said in a statement. \"These transgender students simply want to go to school in the morning without fear of discrimination or harassment. The consequences of this decision will no doubt be heartbreaking. This isn't a 'states' rights' issue, it's a civil rights issue.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:46:56.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
