She also questioned how he had landed in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Seberang Jaya hospital last Wednesday with a head injury and missing toenails. \nPenang Deputy Chief Minister II P Ramasamy had also urged the authorities to look into the matter as the injuries did not seem to have been self-inflicted. \nThe portal also quoted Penang prisons director SAC Kamarudzaman Mamat as saying that Chandran was undergoing psychiatric evaluation, and was in solitary confinement due to mental instability. \n“There was no way he could have been beaten by other prisoners or warders as he was not in contact with any of them during the solitary confinement and evaluation.” \nKamarudzaman had said that they have also started a domestic inquiry into the matter, besides the police investigation. \nChandran’s case comes just days after the custodial death of detainee S Balamurugan at the North Klang district police headquarters on Feb 8. \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:15:27.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
