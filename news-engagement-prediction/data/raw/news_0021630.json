Warriors owner Joe Lacob (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:09 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:09 a.m. ET \nMichael Jordan channeled his inner Ricky Bobby in a conversation with Warriors owner Joe Lacob. \nInstead of saying how impressive it was the Warriors made NBA history by winning 73 games (beating the record set by Jordan's Bulls), the basketball legend said the record was essentially meaningless. \nMORE: Phil Jackson subtweets Carmelo Anthony \nLacob appeared on a Bay Area radio station Tuesday, and told the story of what Jordan said to him. Lacob said this conversation took place during a meetings of owners. \n“Anyway, Michael Jordan — people are drinking and having a good time, and all that — but there was a moment where he said, ‘You know, 73 don’t mean [blank],'” Lacob said. “He did it, Michael Jordan did that. And I looked at him, and I just decided not to make a big deal of it. I said, ‘You know, you’re right, we didn’t win it, we had to get better.’ \n“[Jordan] was fantastic, and I’m not going to cross him, but that kind of hurt.” \nThe comment hurt beacuse Lacob fondly remembers that season. Sure his team blew a 3-1 lead in the Finals, but the Warriors owner still calls it, “one of the greatest years you could ever have in any sport.\" And he's right. \nWhile bringing home the title would have been ideal, a 73-win season is nothing to be ashamed about. \n\"So many things went right. If you remember, all of the games that went our way. I mean, just amazing. It was an unbelievable year,\" Lacob said. \"When I play golf, I wear a hat that says 73 on it. It's sort of my little remembrance of it. Because I know people all say, 'Oh, well you didn't win the championship' -- all the talking heads. You know what, we didn't. But it was still an incredible year and I will never forget it. And we should be very proud of it. And I think as time goes by, there will be more thinking about it. Because I don't think it's gonna be replicated very easily.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T15:37:45.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
