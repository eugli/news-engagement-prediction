Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrols agents were able to quickly deport undocumented immigrants caught within 100 miles of the border who had arrived in the U.S. in the previous two weeks.\nNow : All federal immigration officers can now conduct an \"expedited removal\" anywhere in the U.S. against people who arrived in the U.S. in the previous two years. That will mean fewer opportunities for undocumented immigrants to appear before an immigration judge.\nMORE AGENTS, JAILS, JUDGES Past : Under Obama, most undocumented immigrants caught entering the country were placed in detention or released on bond while their deportation cases proceeded. That practice, dubbed \"catch and release,\" led to many undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. and skipping out on their court cases.\nNow : People caught entering the country will be placed in jail while their deportation cases are processed. Homeland Security plans to hire 10,000 ICE agents and build new detention facilities along the southwest border, and more immigration judges and staff will be hired to speed up cases.\nMore from USA Today:\n'Sad!': Trump goes after 'so-called angry crowds' in GOP districts \nIn San Jose, dramatic rescues as hundreds flee rising floodwaters\nSweden to Trump: Immigrants aren't causing a crime wave \nRETURN TO MEXICO Past : When people reached the U.S. and applied for political asylum or refugee status, they were allowed into the country to await resolution of their request. For example, tens of thousands of women and children have poured across the southwest border from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala seeking protection from their crime-ridden countries.\nNow : Federal immigration officials can send those people back to Mexico, even if they're not from there. The U.S. will work with Mexico's government to set up such a system.\nDEPUTIZE LOCAL POLICE Past : Obama mostly phased out a program that allows ICE agents to \"deputize\" local police officers as immigration agents. That program is opposed by many immigration advocacy groups and police chiefs, who say it reduces immigrant communities' trust in their local police.\nNow : The program will be expanded so ICE can train as many local police officers as possible. Customs and Border Protection also can deputize officers, with a focus on the four border states: California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.\nEXPAND THE WALL Past : Congress in 2006 passed the Secure Fence Act, which allowed for the construction of 700 miles of walls, fences and other barriers along the nearly 2,000-mile border. The work is nearly completed.\nNow : The government must complete that fencing and begin planning for an expansion, estimated to cost up to $21.6 billion to complete.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:59:31.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
