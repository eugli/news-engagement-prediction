But when she looked into the requirements, Marin discovered that state law required her to shell out anywhere from $20,000 to over $100,000 to get a doctor to oversee her operation. \nFrustrated, Marin took matters into her own hands — over the state line. Eighteen months ago, she opened her own pediatric night clinic in Santa Teresa, N.M., less than one mile from the Texas border. She's among dozens of trained nurse practitioners that New Mexico, a state without a pay-to-play requirement, has been able to steal away from Texas. \n\"I'm now working to my full capacity,'' she says. \nTexas' loss is New Mexico's gain — and the gain of 20 other states that Texas has lost qualified nurse practitioners to because they don't needlessly restrict access to qualified health care. \nTexas needs to stop this talent drain. That's why SB 681 and HB 1415 , introduced by state Sen. Kelly Hancock, R-North Richland Hills, and state Rep. Stephanie Klick, R-Fort Worth, deserve a fair and complete hearing this session. \nBoth bills would end the physician supervision requirement, free advanced-practice registered nurses from the costly contracts, and end dual regulation from state nursing and physician oversight boards. These changes would encourage more qualified nurse practitioners like Marin to provide primary care in Texas. \nIn 2013, lawmakers thought they had made progress on health care access problems when they allowed advanced-practice registered nurses, which includes trained nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, nurse anesthetists and clinical nurse specialists, to put out a shingle and provide basic primary care services. As a part of a legislative compromise, they were required to obtain a doctor to sign a document agreeing to supervise their work. \nInstead of giving these RNs more latitude to practice on their own, the law priced them out of Texas — a state that already has a serious physician shortage, particularly in rural areas. \nLawmakers should look to states that allow nurse practitioners to operate without doctor oversight for evidence of how these simple changes could improve access to health care. In California, the number of nurse practitioners doubled from 8,240 in 2004 to over 17,000 in 2008. Nurse practitioners now represent at least 6 percent of all nurses in California, filling in some coverage gaps and saving billions of dollars by providing preventative care. Editorial: Nurse-practitioner law worth Legislature's debate \nA trained nurse practitioner who could treat a runny nose, provide basic primary care and serve more hard-to-reach demographics should be encouraged to stay in Texas, a fast-growing state where the need for health care resources is not going to slow anytime soon. \nThe Texas Medical Association has cited safety concerns and suggested that medicine is better administered as a team. However, many of the sponsoring doctors aren't even in the same town as the nurses, and there is no evidence from other states where nurses have more freedom that patients are at risk. Plus, nurse practitioners here would still be subject to oversight from the Texas Board of Nursing, nor would these bills expand the duties these nurses are allowed to carry out on their own. \nThe bills have widespread support from the AARP, the Texas Association of Business, think tanks and many nursing associations, all part of a large coalition that wisely sees a change in the law as a way to improve health care in hard-to-reach communities. \nTexas must become creative in delivering medical care. A generation of nurses are retiring, nursing schools are not producing enough young nurses to meet rising demand, and many Texas counties have extremely limited access to health care. Freeing nurse practitioners to work without costly impediments is the right thing to do to improve health care access across the state. \nThe real winners if these rules change would be Texas communities that have too few health care options.
