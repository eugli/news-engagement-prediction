We were friendly to each other,\" DePasquale said. \"But they would argue often, yelling loud and vulgar things at each other. I never called the cops. Couples argue all the time. But someone getting shot â€” that surprised me.\" \nDePasquale said he never heard any gunshots. He was shopping Friday, and when he returned home he saw the police in the Homolkas' driveway. \nCourt records show Raymond Homolka has been convicted of several crimes dating back to 1991, including charges of aggravated battery, battery, resisting arrest, and possession of an explosive or incendiary device. He was sentenced to 30 days in Cook County jail in 2012 on charges of aggravated battery and aggravated assault in connection with a fight that occurred at Petey's II restaurant in Orland Park. \nHis most recent arrest was for driving under the influence in December in Orland Park. That case is still pending. \nRaymond Homolka is due back in court Wednesday in Bridgeview. \nDaily Southtown freelance reporter Alicia Fabbre contributed. \nElyssa Cherney is a Tribune reporter and Susan Lafferty is a Daily Southtown reporter. \nslafferty@southtown", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:19:48.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
