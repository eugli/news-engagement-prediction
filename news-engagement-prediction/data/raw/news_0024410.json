Hawks guard Kent Bazemore (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 10:13 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 10:13 p.m. ET \nUnder Armour CEO Kevin Plank calling President Donald Trump an \"asset\" to the country has sent shockwaves throughout social media. \nWarriors guard Stephen Curry, one of the brand's main stars and perhaps its brightest, didnâ€™t concur with Plank. \n\"I agree with that description,\" Curry told the Mercury News, \" if you remove the et .\" \nOn the other hand, one of the people credited with recruiting Curry to the sneaker company believes there are benefits to Trump being a businessman. \nHawks guard Kent Bazemore, a fellow Under Armour athlete, gave his take prior to Atlanta's game against the Nuggets on Wednesday night: \nSN: Kevin Plank made the comments about Trump. What's your take on all that? Bazemore: I didn't even see it. What'd he say? SN: He said Trump's an asset to the country and he looks forward to him being a business-leading president. Bazemore: That's kind of what my thoughts were when he won the presidency. Have a businessman in office, because that's the way the world's trending. Even in the NBA, there's more business and entrepreneurship in athletics these days. And I'm living proof you take care of your brand, good things happen to you ... We've been living some stuff that's been written for 200-300 years. The world has changed. The world has gotten a little smarter. It's good that we have somebody that's hip in that aspect to try to change it. \nAs much as the #StickToSports crowd may hate it, sports are political. Athletes have always been part of the fabric of cultural conversation. Players also have to be ready to choose sides. It appears Curry and Bazemore are on opposite ends in this case.
