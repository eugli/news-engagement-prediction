Caramel deLites \nThe coconut baked onto the cookie gives it a tropical feel. Go with a beer that complements it with other tropical flavors - such as a German hefeweizen, a yeast forward beer that has banana and clove flavoring. \nStock’s beer suggestions: Try the hefeweizen from Weihenstephaner or a local option. Peanut Butter Sandwich / Peanut Butter Patties \nIf you have the opportunity to eat and drink something with peanut butter flavoring, go for it, Stock said. \nStock’s beer suggestion: Terrapin Beer Co.’s Liquid Bliss. This chocolate peanut butter porter gives you a lot of peanut butter on the nose rather than on your palate (it skews a bit more chocolate in taste). Shortbread \nShortbread cookies are one of the better options to pair with milk, Stock said. Pair it with a cream ale, which is brewed with lactose sugar (an unfermentable milk sugar). It’s a residual note in the beer, giving it a hint of creaminess and a touch of milky vanilla sweetness - a perfect way to complement Shortbread’s texture. \nStock’s beer suggestions: Chameleon Cream Ale from Dead Lizard Brewing Co. or the Killer Whale Cream Ale from Bold City Brewery . S’mores \nAll of the delicious s’mores flavors can be found in this cookie - the graham cracker, chocolate, marshmallow - but it’s missing the smokiness gained from melting a marshmallow over a campfire. Go with a beer that uses smoked malts such as a rauchbier, a German beer style that uses malts dried over an open fire. \nStock’s beer suggestions: Try some beers from Schlenkerla Brewery , a German brewery that makes a number of smoked beers or the smoked porter from Stone Brewing . Thin Mints \nStick with a simple pairing. Mint is such an overpowering flavor, opt for chocolate flavor such as a chocolate stout or porter, Stock said. \nStock’s beer suggestion: Cigar City Brewing’s Jose Marti, a coffee porter with a rich chocolate note. Or, go with the Porter from Founders Brewing (which is one of the five best porters in the country, Stock said). \n  \nldelgado@orlandosentinel.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:05:25.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
