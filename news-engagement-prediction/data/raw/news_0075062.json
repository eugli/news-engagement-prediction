Picture: Jenifer Jagielski\nFINDING an enviable spot along the Nepean River in the mid-1950s, artisans Margo and Gerald Lewers intended to simply build a home with a studio. Forerunners of Australia’s modern art movement would gather for spirited conversations and debate as Margo delighted them all with her superb cooking. Now, the outlandish parties have given way to a casual outdoor cafe that serves delicious and clever dishes such as the persian hotcakes with rosewater ricotta, and the prosciutto with yellow peaches salad. With a friendly environment cultivated by co-owners Ben Dorrell and Penny Cleary and impressive meals by chef Steve Grant, Margo’s creativity and hospitality lives on in Emu Plains. — Penrith Regional Gallery, 86 River Rd\nZOKOKO\nmedia_camera Cacao beans at Zokoko. media_camera Hot chocolate. Picture: Jenifer Jagielski media_camera Zokoko co-owner Michelle Morgan.\nTHERE may have been a bit of divine intervention when it came to Michelle Morgan finding her path to artisan chocolates by way of the cacao-filled hills above an animal sanctuary she’d visited in Bolivia. Using traditional methods, formal teachings from a chocolate technology school and vintage equipment, Zokoko has since gone on to win numerous accolades, including a gold medal for their Goddess Milk Chocolate Bar at the International Chocolate Salon and Artisan awards. “It’s amazing how much different chocolate tastes when you take time to savour it,” Ms Morgan said. — Unit 3/84-90 Old Bathurst Rd\nMORGAN’S COFFEE\nmedia_camera Ready for roasting at Morgan’s. Picture: Jenifer Jagielski\nA PASSION for quality coffee is what often drives boutique cafe owners to source their beans from independent farmers around the world. But for Morgan’s Coffee owner Dean Morgan, knowing where the beans come from isn’t enough. To him, truly sourcing great product means going to the farms, observing the land, meeting the growers and often times working with them on how best to access the market. Back at his roasting facilities, he’s just as meticulous, continually testing and tasting the beans to ensure the best quality. And when you order a cup from the cafe next door, your first sip is testament that it’s well worth the effort. — Unit 3/84-10 Old Bathurst Rd\nSAVVY CAKES BY LENA\nmedia_camera Savvy Cakes by Lena. media_camera Savvy Cakes by Lena.\nWHEN Lena McKechnie went to order a birthday cake for her December baby, she came up short, so out of necessity she made one herself. Turns out she’s pretty good at it and, eight years on, she’s still making speciality cakes but added to her offering with cupcakes ranging from classic chocolate to the curious ones with Coca-Cola. However, Ms McKechnie notes that it’s her traditional vanilla sugar cookies with their whimsical milk and fairy bread designs that have become a fan favourite. — www.savvycakes.com.au\nO’DONOGHUE’S IRISH PUB\nmedia_camera Stacked burger at O’Donoghue’s.
