His body will then be wrapped in a polyethylene, submerged in alcohol and lowered into ice before being shipped to Arizona. The head will then be removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored. \nAccording to MacLennan, if organs can be donated and aren't wasted anymore, brains should definitely not be wasted, instead it's the important part to store. \nWhile the full-body procedure costs 75,000 pounds, the author from Skye, has opted for the 40,000 pounds brain freeze. \nIn November last year, a 14-year old girl who died of cancer became the first child to be cryogenically frozen after death in the UK. \nThe procedure was carried out after winning a landmark court case shortly before her death. She had written a heartbreaking letter to a judge explaining that she wanted a chance to “live longer” after suffering from a rare form of deadly cancer.
