Eisenhower (CVN 69) Public Affairs ATLANTIC OCEAN (NNS) -- Aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) (Ike) departed Naval Station Norfolk to host pilots of the \"Gladiators\" of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 106 and several student pilots from Training Air Wings 1 and 2 to help them earn carrier qualifications, Feb. 4. This marked the first time Ike left Norfolk since returning from a seven-month deployment, Dec. 30, 2016, and the ship is currently in the sustainment phase of the Optimized Fleet Response Plan (OFRP). Sustainment phase contains a variety of evolutions designed to sustain warfighting readiness so the Navy preserves surge capacity and combat-ready deployable assets. Sustainability is created by doing proper maintenance to get platforms to their expected service lives, ensuring units and strike groups receive all expected training, build generational technical expertise, and control deployments. Accomplishing these goals helps ensure the Navy retains its best and brightest, which also contributes to sustainability. During this underway period, one of Ike's focal points will be the training of tomorrow's naval aviators, a key component to sustainability and maximizing the Navy's warfighting capabilities. \"Carrier qualification is a requirement for student naval aviators, or pilots still in training,\" said Cmdr. Bill Delmar, Ike's combat direction center officer. \"They land on an aircraft carrier and make their first landings at sea. It's a vital part of naval aviation and something that makes us different than the Air Force. They have a long runway that doesn't move, while we have a pitching flight deck. These qualifications are a student pilot's last step to becoming a winged aviator.\" This underway will also serve to maintain the skills displayed by the entire crew during deployment. After a monthlong hiatus, as well as the arrival of new crew members who have never gone underway, some time is needed to re-adjust to operational functionality and maintain a deployed-force level of proficiency. This is understood well by even the most junior Ike Sailors. \"Leave was good and gave me the chance to spend some time with my family,\" Damage Controlman Fireman Damion Howell said. \"Now it is time to get back to work. Pulling out this time is a little different after deployment, but it's no less important. We definitely have a different mentality and are more experienced in how we run our operation. We just have to stay sharp.\" While returning Sailors are working off any rust, junior leaders have the chance to use their new on-the-job experience to prepare Sailors new to the command in their areas of responsibility. \"Over leave I had a lot of time to relax and visited my family in New York for a little while,\" said Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class David Ross, who came to Ike nearly halfway through its deployment. \"It's a little different this time around because I've established myself and have something to come back to. I also now know a lot more about the ship and the team in medical. We also have some new check-ins we have to get up to speed.\" Ike remains in an operational status following its deployment in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. As the ready carrier of the east coast, Ike is standing by to respond if needed. For more information, visit www.navy.mil , www.facebook.com/usnavy , or www.twitter.com/usnavy .
