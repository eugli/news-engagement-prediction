Credit Aaron Lavinsky/Star Tribune, via Associated Press Gwendolyn Gillen, a Wisconsin artist whose bronze sculpture of Mary Tyler Moore tossing her hat became a downtown Minneapolis landmark, died on Friday, two days after Ms. Moore’s death , in Madison, Wis. She was 76. Her death, in hospice care, was confirmed by her daughter, Alessandra Gillen. Ms. Gillen’s life-size statue of Ms. Moore was dedicated in April 2002 in the outdoor Nicollet Mall, near where Ms. Moore threw her tam in the opening credits of her long-running sitcom, “The Mary Tyler Moore Show.” The sculpture was commissioned by the cable channel TV Land, which at the time had reruns of the show on its schedule. The channel paid $55,000 for the sculpture, plus all costs to the city for overseeing the project. Ms. Gillen, who completed the sculpture in clay and bronzed it shortly before its unveiling, said she determined how to depict the tossing of the hat by analyzing her own arm tossing a tam in the living room of her home in Hustisford, Wis. The statue is on display in the Minneapolis visitor center while the mall is under reconstruction. \nThe New York Times contributed reporting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:56:18.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
