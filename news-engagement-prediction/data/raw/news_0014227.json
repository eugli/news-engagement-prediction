During that span, Florida has dropped five straight to Kentucky, losing all five games by an average of 13.4 points.\nThe last time Florida defeated Kentucky, Scottie Wilbekin dove for a loose ball on an empty Wildcats possession as time expired, as the Gators celebrated their SEC Tournament title at midcourt in the Georgia Dome on March 16, 2014.\nConsidering how the previous two seasons have gone, Florida’s squad this year is its best since that 2013-14 team reached the Final Four riding a 30-game winning streak. The No. 24 Gators (17-5, 7-2 SEC) have some quality wins on their resume, but a victory over the No. 8 Wildcats (18-4, 8-1 SEC) on Saturday night at 8:15 p.m. ET in the O’Connell Center would unquestionably be big.\nFlorida is just 1-4 against teams in the top 25 nationally in RPI (with losses to FSU, Gonzaga, Duke and South Carolina) but 3-1 against teams in the 26-50 range and 6-0 against those in the 51-100 range. A victory against Kentucky (No. 6 in RPI) would serve the Gators well in their quest for a good seeding in March.\n“I think it’d be a huge breakthrough win for us, if we can get it done,” White said. “We’ve had opportunities there. Duke, for the most part, maintained a decent lead, if you think about the last 30 minutes or so of that game. But Gonzaga, we had a double digit lead in the first half. Had a five-point halftime lead. We played at Florida State in a great environment in a rivalry game, and we were right there. Minus three or four mistakes, maybe you have a chance to go steal that one. And we didn’t take advantage of course, so here’s another one.\n“One factor is how well Kentucky plays. Another factor is going to be how quickly again we can make this turn and how good our focus is today and tomorrow. The environment is going to be great. If we play well, maybe we’re in a position to where it’s a 2-3 possession game there, where 2-3 possessions in the second, if we do this as opposed to this, we can overcome. We can get over the hump and win a really big one.”\nConsidering the Gators just played a game Thursday night against Missouri, the preparation for Saturday’s matchup against the Wildcats will be condensed. The important SEC showdown will certainly be a test of Florida’s stamina and maturity.\n* Jay Bilas previews Saturday's Florida-Kentucky matchup\n* Instant Analysis: Before hyped matchup with Kentucky, Florida routs Mizzou\n* Take Five: Everything you need to know about JaJuan Seider\n* Signing Class Grades: Offense\n* Signing Class Positional Grades - Defense\n* Player switches positions ahead of spring ball\n* Florida coaches share signee evaluations\n* GET TWO FREE MONTHS OF INSIDE THE GATORS\n“I was really pleased with our maturity last night,” White said of Florida’s 93-54 win over Mizzou. “Again knock on wood, you hope we play really mature tomorrow. With a game like that you get off to such a good start, you got a big game looming with all of campus buzzing. For a team that we haven't experience a high level of success against other than Kasey Hill. We handle it really well. There is more steps to be taken of course with this program and building of a culture, but we are really pleased with where they started and where we maintained it.”\nThe Gators, who are winners of three straight (against LSU, Oklahoma and Missouri each by more than 30 points) are confident heading into Saturday’s matchup and have a “healthy respect” for the Wildcats, according to White. Kentucky has gone just 1-2 in its past three games, with losses at Tennessee (82-80) and at home against No. 3 Kansas (79-73) followed by a 90-81 win over Georgia without starting point guard De’Aaron Fox (illness, ankle), who is questionable for Saturday.\nWhite is preparing for an up-tempo matchup against UK. Propelled by its quick guards, Kentucky ranks 14th nationally in adjusted tempo and is fourth in the country in adjusted offensive efficiency, per KenPom.com, with freshman guard Malik Monk leading the way in scoring with 22.4 points per game. Florida is seventh in the country in adjusted defensive efficiency.\n\"Well, transition defense is huge,” White said. “We've got to stop that ball, of course. Especially with Fox and Briscoe, we have to do a good job by-committee trying to limit the number of times they get in the paint and in transition, but it's easier said than done, too, when you need to be extended on a guy like Monk, when you need to rim run and wrestle with (Edrice) Adebayo so that he doesn't get good post position on transition duck-ins. Playing a team like Kentucky, like playing a team like Gonzaga earlier in the year or playing a team like Duke, you can't make glaring mistakes. You've got to be good at everything just to give yourselves a chance. And this is one of those teams that you can still play pretty well and still not win, so obviously we've got to do our best to play our best just to give ourselves a chance.\n“I know a lot of teams have done a good job of limiting his touches. I'm not sure that we have had a lot of experience doing that,” White added on Monk. “It's just not who we are, but if you allow him to get a couple of easy ones, especially early, you're in for a long night. He's one of the most talented players in the country. He's already hit 70 3s. He can make contested, tough 3s, jump 40 inches and jump backwards and jump sideways. He's got an ability to get it off whenever he wants. We just have to make sure that everyone is contested and make everything he does, make it hard.”\nFlorida is also bracing for the challenge of defending Kentucky’s frontcourt, including Adebayo (13.2 PPG, 6.8 RPG).\n“He’s great in the offensive glass. He’s a great field goal percentage finisher. He’s just a high-percentage guy,” White said of the Wildcats freshman forward. “But again, at the same time if he’s your focal point, then you’ve got three guards out there that are all tremendous players that you can’t allow your focus to drop on those guys on how we’re defending those guys, so on and so forth.\n\"We’ve got to be able to hold our own to a certain extent without allowing any of these Kentucky players to demand two defenders, because that’s when you’re really in trouble.”\n-", "external_links": ["https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/ms5s4uotk6i1rhaav4ye)", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/ms5s4uotk6i1rhaav4ye"], "published": "2017-02-03T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:16:43.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
