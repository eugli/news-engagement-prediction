While you might think that requires a lot of upkeep, the model-actress insists otherwise. \"I like to keep my haircare routine to a minimum because I'm traveling all the time,\" she told ELLE.com, detailing her regimen: wash hair as needed using a Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner , sometimes every day, rough dry, and give herself a blowout with a round brush, then when she has time, use Sarah Potempa's Beachwaver to get a loose texture in the hair (\"I can get my whole head in ten minutes, which is good considering I have quite thick hair\" she claims). \nHer biggest tip, however, is to use a good serum. \"I color my hair, so hydration is really important. I'm also working all the time with hot styling irons, so after that I put a little Moroccanoil serum into my hair. Just a tiny, tiny amount.\" Other days, she'll rely on a super affordable hair mask alternative: coconut oil. \nOf course, one of the reasons her hair always looks on point is because she gets to work with the world's best hairstylists for red carpet events. It's hard to pick a favorite moment, but we managed to narrow it down to nine from the past six years that Rosie broke down for us herself, here: Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 1 2011: Wispy Updo \n\"This was the first Vanity [Fair] party I went to and it seems like a lifetime ago. I certainly wouldn't say I was somebody that follows hair trends or is particularly experimental. This was just about doing a little simple updo that really showed off the earrings and the neckline of the dress and something that felt very effortless and relaxed. I don't often do a hairstyle like this anymore–it's a nice look and I'll have to try it again soon!\" Getty 2 2011: Hair Down \n\"With hair, I always look at the dress and I think that your hair and makeup is guided by whatever you're wearing and of course the mood that you're in. I would say of late, I experiment with up-dos a little bit more, but this dress had quite a lot of details on it. So, I think that we just wanted to do something that didn't detract from the dress at all. It was about having healthy-looking, relaxed hair and it not being a feature of the look at all–just letting the dress and the jewelry do its job.\" Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 3 2012: Sleek Ponytail \n\"This is actually one of my favorite hair moments over the last few years. It was one of the first times I worked with one of my favorite hairstylists, Jenny Cho . She is just so brilliant at executing modern and sleek, elegant hair and has the most meticulous attention to detail. I think the reason this ponytail doesn't look casual is, it's all about the condition of the hair and the shine that she's got [and] it's in the parting. She wrapped hair around the hair tie, which instantly makes something feel more of a 'look.' I suppose it just a true testament to the fact that you can rock a ponytail on the red carpet.\" Getty 4 2013: Buttery Blonde \n\"The thing I loved about this Valentino dress is I got this kind of saloon-y, kind of cowgirl sort of feel, so for the hair, I really wanted it to embody that as well. I think a deep side parting with that loose wave is a real classic red carpet [look], it's a nod to Veronica Lake, but this is a bit more updated and modern. My hair was just freshly colored by my wonderful hair colorist, Lorri Goddard , who does such a wonderful job making blondes really stick, and Giannandrea did a really lovely job on my hair that night. I love being blonde, but the thing about blonde is I find it hard to maintain past six or seven weeks. I try and put a water filter on the shower head and that's one way to help it last a little bit longer, and of course a great hair routine.\" Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 5 2015: The Lob \n\"I hadn't had my hair that short since I was a little girl! I loved cutting my hair off to this length. It was so liberating and it was just a real fun moment in time. I really recommend it to anybody. That night in particular, I think it had just been cut short, and it was one of the first times I had gone out on a red carpet [with it]. One of my best friends did my hair that night, Christian Wood . It was all about being easy and effortless. It makes me wanna cut it all off again!\" Getty 6 2015: Wet Ballerina Bun \n\"This hair and makeup look is probably one of my favorite red carpet moments of all time. I think that [wearing] the hair down wouldn't let the dress do it's job and there was this neckpiece, so in the end we wanted to something up. I remember Christian [Wood] pushing me to do this sleek, wet bun. I wasn't sure if it was gonna look right and he said, 'Let me do it and you'll see.' I wanted this whole look to feel incredibly statuesque and very powerful and the hair look, in the end, was a really tough and empowering look.\" Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 7 2015: Rolled Updo \n\"This was Christian [Wood] as well, and I don't often do hairstyles like this. The dress was Stella McCartney and very, very feminine and this event was about celebrating women, so I wanted to do something that was really feminine and I was in the mood to do something a little bit different. I think I had probably, knowing me, seen some kind of reference somewhere and Christian and I spoke about it. I always [say], just do it and see if I like it. We can always take it out and he put it up and I loved it and it really looked elegant and feminine with the dress. It's a really pretty hairstyle, super easy to do on your own as well. You kind of roll hair into itself and keep pinning and pinning.\" Getty 8 2016: Signature Look \n\"Center parting with a really polished, blown-out, shiny finish to the hair running down my back is, I would say, my signature go-to look for when I want to wear my hair down and I want something really simple, quick, and easy. All my hairstylists know that's my go-to look when I don't know what else to do and it works every time. It never fails. Center parting for me, I always feel like it's a little more, it's a little tougher and it's a little bit cooler and stronger. \" Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 9 2016: Elevated Topknot \n\"George Northwood did this look on me. He's one of my oldest, oldest friends who I've been working with since I was 16 in London. This dress is a knockout dress and I was lucky enough to wear some beautiful jewelry and we wanted to a red lip. So it was a lot. I didn't want to do a classic bun at the back of my head or low down, because that would've made it look too casual. I think the top knot gave it a bit of an edgier look.\" Getty ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:17:56.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
