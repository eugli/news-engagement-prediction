Key points: Animal group that includes crocodiles, dinosaurs and birds thought to exclusively lay eggs rather than give birth to live young 245-million-year-old fossil from this group discovered with what looks like the remains of an embryo inside Aquatic lifestyle may explain why this animal gave birth to young but other members of the group did not \nThe fossil of the long-necked Dinocephalosaurus , which swam the seas during the Middle Triassic period around 245 million years ago, was unearthed by an international team of scientists in south-west China. \nInside the fossil was a much smaller fossil of the same species positioned in a way that suggested it was an embryo rather than the remains of prey, according to a paper published today in Nature Communications . \nThe marine reptile came from a group called the Archosauromorphs, which evolved 260 million years ago and includes modern-day birds and crocodiles, as well as extinct dinosaurs and pterosaurs. \nThe lack of fossil evidence for live birth — or viviparity — in this reptile group had long-puzzled scientists. \nIt contrasts with the other major reptile group, the Lepidosauromorphs, which includes snakes and lizards. \n\"In modern-day lizards and snakes, we see the evolution of viviparity over 100 times,\" said co-author Matthew Brandley, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Sydney. \nAustralia is host to a number of lizard species that give birth to live young, including the familiar blue-tongue lizard and many skink species, as well as sea snakes that have live young. \nBut all crocodiles and birds lay eggs, as did their ancient relatives, the dinosaurs. \n\"One of the hardest questions in evolutionary biology is why something doesn't happen, so we've always wondered why [live birthing] doesn't happen in these archosaurs,\" Dr Brandley said. \nWith this fossil discovery, scientists can at least rule out the possibility that animals in this group were somehow incapable of evolving the ability to give birth to live young.

(Supplied: Jun Liu) So why don't birds or crocodiles give birth to live young? \nDr Brandley said the fact that Dinocephalosaurus was an aquatic creature could be one reason why it evolved the ability to give birth to live young. \n\"Just like in sea snakes, if you're aquatic you can't lay eggs underwater, so over evolutionary time, as these terrestrial ancestors moved to an aquatic habitat, they started to develop this viviparous reproductive mode,\" he said. \nLive-birthing is not a difficult evolutionary step from egg-laying, as illustrated by the fact that it has appeared so often among lizards and snakes. \nBut that does not necessarily explain why live-birth is not found in any modern birds and crocodiles, Dr Brandley said. \nKnowing that the ancient reptiles in this group gave birth to live young suggests there is some other mechanism that has prevented it from becoming more widespread. \n\"It's possible in an evolutionary sense but there's some good ecological reason or behavioural reason that it didn't evolve in modern-day archosaurs or dinosaurs,\" Dr Brandley said. \n\"In other words, if there were evolutionary scenarios that would favour it, there's something counteracting that.\" \nThat counteracting effect could be something function: for example, it would be difficult for a bird to lay live young as it would struggle to fly while carrying a heavy embryo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:12:33.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
