Not until after we get married. My partner is very traditional,” she told The Times . \n“We can’t ... I mean we’re just ... waiting,” she said. \nThe comments mark a sharp change from her previous interviews such as with British GQ in which she spoke about using sex as exercise and joining the mile-high club. \n“Let’s put it this way, I’ve had an orgasm in the air before. Alone. And together,” she said back in 2014 . Entrepreneur Evan Spiegel is expected to list Snapchat on the stockmarket shortly with a valuation of around US$25 billion.
