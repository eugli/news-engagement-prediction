MONTEGRANDE \nThe arts unite people and neutralize political tensions among the superpowers. \nGrammy award-winning Korean soprano Sumi Jo made this statement after announcing in a message sent via e-mail that she is donating her talent fee for her concert tonight at the Meralco Theater to the Tulay ng Kabataan Foundation, which takes care of abandoned and abused children. \nThe Tulay ng Kabataan is the same orphanage that Pope Francis visited in 2015. ADVERTISEMENT \nJo was the first Korean ever nominated for an Oscar for her interpretation of “Simple Song No. 3” composed by American composer David Lang from the movie “Youth” last year. \nJo, a devout Christian, is known for her charitable works for orphanages and for her advocacy against animal cruelty. \n“I have good memories of my last concert in Manila and I was happy to have helped victims of Typhoon ‘Yolanda.’ This time I would like to help Filipino children and show people that I care a lot about promoting friendship between South Korea and the Philippines,” she said. \nJo, the cultural envoy of her country and the ambassador for peace of Unesco, said she is concerned that there is so much publicity about a Korean killed in Manila and Koreans allegedly involved in the drug trade. \n“There is more to Koreans than we read in the newspapers. We love music and the arts, and international competitions will show Koreans excel in music. I do believe music can do a lot to promote genuine friendship. For this reason, I want to give a good example by sharing what I have with less fortunate Filipino children. I hope to show my countrymen and my Filipino fans the meaning of sharing,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:20:14.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
