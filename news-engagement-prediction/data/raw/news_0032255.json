It’s OK, just keep on fighting. This is not OK,'” Bob said. \n“I think this is important because it’s a moral issue more than anything,” Edmonton protester Catalina Latis said. “What they wanted to pass in Romania was unacceptable.” \nLatis added she believes the people in Romania need to know people around the world are supporting their struggle. \nAn illuminated banner reading \\”Resist\\” is carried through the crowd during a demonstration in Bucharest, Romania, Sunday, Feb. 12, 2017.

Good luck Romania.” \n-With files from the Associated Press. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
