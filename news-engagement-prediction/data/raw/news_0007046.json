He even helped translate into English what Labidi was saying through his tears. He looked like he wanted to take him into his arms. \nThere were others who have said the right things, among them Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the opposition leaders, the Robin Williams-esque Quebec City Mayor, Régis Labeaume, the smart young Liberal MP for the area, Joel Lightbound. \nBut Couillard was the giant, happy to admit ours isn’t a perfect society, but damn sure it’s worth the fight to keep. I thought he was magnificent. \nAt the end of the presser, he said “We are all Quebecois. \n“Once we say this, then we talk to each other. \n“Next time you walk past someone of the Muslim community, why don’t you stop and say hello?” \nThen all the people who had spoken this day held hands as one of them sang a prayer, in Arabic. \nIn a fractured world, it sounded lovely, and just right.
