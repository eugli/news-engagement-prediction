Cases of W strain increasing in Australia \nThere are five main strains of meningococcal disease: A, C, W, Y and B. \nIn Australia, the B strain is the most common form of the disease, although in the last two years the W strain, which was previously rare, has been noticeably increasing. \nOf the 256 cases of meningococcal disease in Australia last year, 48 to 50 per cent were cases of the W strain. \nDr Vicky Sheppeard, the NSW Health director for communicable diseases, said people of all ages were vulnerable to the W strain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:15:53.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
