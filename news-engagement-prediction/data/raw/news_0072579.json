Stop this incubator of #Antisemitism and other hate. WE BEG YOU @POTUS @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/RHuIjdE2Yg \nWatch the report courtesy of CNN: Another Jewish cementary has been vandalized, Anne Frank Center calls for White House to take action https://t.co/J3l861PPMi \n— New Day (@NewDay) February 27, 2017 \nDonald Trump, who draws so much support from his anti-Semitic, white supremacist base, has been reluctant to upset his followers by defending Jews from these increasingly violent acts, from bomb threats to vandalism. Over 150 tombstones were damaged in the first attack and at least 100 in the second. A nearby Christian cemetery was untouched. \nIn fact, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) documented over one thousand “Bias-related incidents” in the first month following the election, including over 100 swastikas and “scores” of bomb threats against Jewish community centers in just the last month . \nThe Anne Frank Center wants Donald Trump to speak out against anti-Semitism. He is unlikely to do so. Trump’s popularity continues to sink as his disapproval rating climbs, and he is more reliant than ever on the very people who promote this kind of behavior. \nTrump’s crowd in Melbourne, Florida, was smaller than earlier crowds there, only highlighting his problems. If he were to disavow this demographic, his next such rally would be given only to his cheering staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T18:00:35.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
