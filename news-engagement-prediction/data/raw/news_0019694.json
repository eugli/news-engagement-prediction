Ian MacDonald with Abbotsford Police. \nBoth the suspect and his friend have been taken into custody, and Abbotsford Police are investigating. Break and Enter suspect asks for push as getaway vehicle is stuck. He asked the B&E victim who calls police. #abbypd arrest him #TrueStory \n— Abbotsford Police (@AbbyPoliceDept) February 7, 2017 \nIn an unrelated incident where snow helped stop a criminal in his tracks, Abbotsford Police arrested a man, who allegedly tried to steal a car on Cheam Drive around 7:15 a.m. this morning. \nMacDonald said, in that case, the owner seems to have left the vehicle idling outside to warm up his engine. \n“As happens sometimes when you do that, criminals seize on the opportunity, jump in the car and drive away.” \nBut with all the snow on the ground, MacDonald says the suspect did not get very far. \n“He ended up getting stuck in the snow and abandoned the stolen vehicle,” he said. “Of course, when you walk away in more than a foot of snow, you leave tracks from the vehicle you are fleeing.” \nWhen police caught up with him, the man still had the keys and some other belongings from the car on him. Suspect stole an idling truck, drove it until it got stuck in the snow. Ran away with evidence in his pockets.

I can go out on a limb and say he probably would not be exercising all the precautions.” MacDonald adds the two cases are unusual in more than one way, since they usually see a decline in crime calls when the weather gets cold and snowy. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:20:01.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
