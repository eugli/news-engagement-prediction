Trump’s travel ban was temporarily halted by a federal judge Friday. \nThe protest, sponsored by more than a dozen advocacy groups and local politicians, was held at the historic Stonewall Inn in Manhattan’s West Village neighborhood, the symbolic heart of the LGBTQ rights movement . #&together #weresist - if you are in NY go to Stonewall today to stand against discrimination https://t.co/vAMPpZx1dZ — Sarah Kate Ellis (@sarahkateellis) February 4, 2017 \nOther protests to “Resist Trump” were scheduled across the country through the weekend. Demonstrations were planned in cities that include Denver, Houston and Buffalo , New York. \nThe Stonewall Inn’s legacy began June 28, 1969, when hundreds in the LGBTQ community fought back against police attempting to arrest them. At the time, homosexuality was illegal, and Stonewall patrons had been routinely harassed by cops. It is credited with being the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement. \nOn June 27, 2016 ― more than 40 years after the Stonewall riots ― the site was declared a national monument by President Barack Obama. The monument protects more than seven acres of land in Greenwich Village, including Christopher Park, the inn, and surrounding streets and sidewalks. \nMore recently, thousands showed up at the inn to honor those killed at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub last summer. LGBTQ people were specifically targeted at the club in what became the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. \nThe inn also was a hub for celebration after the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in 2015 that all states must recognize same-sex marriage .
