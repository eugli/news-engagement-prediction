A post shared by Megan Jayne Crabbe 🐼 (@bodyposipanda) on Jan 29, 2017 at 12:11pm PST \nPeople were commenting on her ‘before’ shots, to tell her that she looked better than the ‘after’ despite not suffering anymore. \nWhile hurtful, Megan decided not to let the trolls get the better of her. Instead, she stood up to them – and made it clear that what they thought had absolutely no influence over how she felt. \nShe wrote, on a new side-by-side snap: ‘”Wait so you just decided to RUIN your body?’ Nah, I just stopped torturing myself every day for not fitting an image I was never supposed to be. \n”But you look so much healthier to me before,’ That’s funny, you looked so much more intelligent to me before you equated health with weight and forgot that mental health is health too.

No matter how much weight I lost there was always still something to hate. \nAnd sure, people don’t NEED to gain weight to find their self love, this is just what my body needed to do to match up to my mental freedom. THIS IS MY HAPPY BODY.’ A post shared by Megan Jayne Crabbe 🐼 (@bodyposipanda) on Feb 6, 2017 at 12:15pm PST \nAnd, after one comment suggested that Megan couldn’t possibly be happy at the size she is now, she had the perfect comeback for them: ‘I didn’t think I could either, but as it turns out, happiness isn’t a size. And I wasted far too many years believing that it was. More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:51:18.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
