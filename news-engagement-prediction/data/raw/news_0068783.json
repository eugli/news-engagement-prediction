Trump's replacement choice, retired vice admiral Robert S. Harward, turned down the job. Then, Trump's nominee for Secretary of Labor, the fast food magnate Andrew Puzder, withdrew himself from consideration due to bipartisan opposition in Congress. \nAlmost every weekend since taking office, Trump has escaped to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. While again in Florida on Feb. 18, Trump made his now-famous \"last light in Sweden\" comment to a crowd of supporters. \n“You look at what's happening. We’ve got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?” \nThe remark, with its implication that there was a terror attack in that country, baffled people around the world who wondered what he was referring to, observes The New York Times. \nOn Twitter, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt wrote: \"Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking?\" \nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders attempted to clarify, saying that the president was referring to crime in general in Sweden, not to a particular attack. \nOn Feb. 19, Trump said on Twitter that his mysterious reference pertained to something he'd seen on Fox News about immigrants in Sweden.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T19:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:01:22.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
