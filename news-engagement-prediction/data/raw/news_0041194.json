Those two have left us with nothing, absolutely nothing. \n\"They took everything from us and I am still angry about what happened. \n\"We are just existing from day to day.\" Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T16:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T11:30:03.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
