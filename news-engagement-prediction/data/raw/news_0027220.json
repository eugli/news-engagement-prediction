We have received several concerns and well wishes from all over North America. Of which, 2 wonderful families were able to provide enough information that allowed the city of Edmonton Animal Control officers to locate the owner of the pitbull. Without you we would not have been able to put closure to this horrible incident.”\nBut even though the owner was found, Quinn is gone, and Alysha and her mother witnessed a grisly event.\n\"The dogs are like children to my daughter and to my wife, and to witness that was quite traumatic,\" Crooks said.\nWith files from Nicole Weisberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:24:20.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
