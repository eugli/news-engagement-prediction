Think again. \nThe next vacancy really matters. Most court watchers believe the next seat will come open when either Kennedy or Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a Clinton appointee, leaves the court. To see either one of them replaced by a traditionalist in the Scalia mold – and Trump has said Scalia is his model for what a Supreme Court justice should be – will change the direction of the court. Politically the smart play for the Democrats would have been to let the first nomination through and fight to the death on the second. \nThis all matters, especially for the left because, as Gorsuch himself wrote for National Review in 2005 , \"American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda.\" \nIt is the so-called party of the people, the party of Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Bill and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, who want the people in black robes making the really important decisions about the scope and size of government. They want to ratify their expansionist policy agenda, creating or finding rights in the Constitution and limiting the power of \"We, the people\" to be self-governing. In committing their all to fight whomever the president picked they have committed a strategic and tactical error they will soon regret.
