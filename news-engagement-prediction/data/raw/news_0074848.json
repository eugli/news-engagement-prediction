'because it's home' but clarified he could still play elsewhere. Lonzo Ball (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:43 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:43 a.m. ET \nLonzo Ball's father wants to set the record straight. \nShortly after telling an Arizona radio station on Saturday the UCLA star would play for only the Lakers, LaVar Ball clarified he was expressing his own desire about where he wants his son to play. \nMORE: Lonzo Ball's dad says son will 'only play for the Lakers' \n\"All I said was that my boy is going to play for the Lakers, and I'm going to speak it into existence,\" LaVar Ball told ESPN on Saturday night. \"I want him to be a Laker, but I wasn't saying he's only going to play for the Lakers. \n\"I'm not trying to say he won't play for a different team. But I'd like him to play for the Lakers because it's home, and I'd love him to learn from Magic [Johnson]. He's the best guard ever to me, and nobody better for Lonzo to learn from than Magic Johnson.\" \nLaVar, who compared his son to Warriors star Stephen Curry earlier this month, elaborated on his initial statement that he would tell any team drafting before the Lakers to avoid selecting his son. \n\"I want him to be a Laker,\" Ball told KCUB Sports Radio 1290 earlier Saturday. \"He's gonna be the first one that's homegrown, and trust me, he'll do the same thing he's doing at UCLA.\" \nLonzo, 19, is projected to be a top pick in the NBA Draft when his time comes. The 6-6 freshman guard is averaging 15.0 points, 6.3 rebounds and 7.5 assists for the Bruins this season.
