I've got some great temmmates, some great help to help get this done. It's been a dream come true. Just having fun. \n\"My grandma wanted me to tell everyone they slept on me, and I should come in here and win it. I did that.\" \nHe leaped the mascot, teammate Paul George and a cheerleader for a reverse slam to capture the title. \n“I originally planned for it just to be PG,” Robinson III said. “I knew I had to bring out something special. We added the mascot and the cheerleader. I really just wanted to get up high and dunk that thing hard, man. My adrenaline was going. It felt like I was looking at the rim. All I knew was the crowd was going crazy.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T09:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:16:26.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
