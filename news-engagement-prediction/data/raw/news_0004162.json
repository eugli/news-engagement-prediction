Photo: Stefan Postles \nThe Liberal Party declared $14.7m in donations for the 2015-16 financial year, while Labor declared $10.4m, mostly from the unions. \nThe flow of donations hit its peak right at the end of June, just before polling day - suggesting money would have continued to come in after the disclosure cut-off date, to be included in next year's returns. \nMining businessman Paul Marks was the biggest single donor to any party, personally giving $1.3 million to the Liberal Party. It is believed to be the second biggest personal donation in Australian history, behind Graeme Wood's $1.6 million donation to the Greens in 2010. \nMr Marks is a controversial figure, closely linked to government MP Stuart Robert. Mr Robert was sacked from the frontbench last year after being accused of using his ministerial office to open doors for Mr Marks and his companies in China. Mr Marks' companies contributed a further $150,000. \nMr Wood – the wealthy founder of travel website Wotif – was also a major donor this year, giving another $636,000 to the Greens, making him their primary benefactor. Reclusive mathematician, investor and high-end gambler Duncan Turpie was also a big contributor to the Greens, giving $500,000. \nTop Education Group donated more than $48,000 to the Liberal Party and $23,000 to the Labor Party during the financial year. Labor's Sam Dastyari was forced to resign from the frontbench last year after it emerged he asked the company to pay a bill for him - a controversy that put foreign donations firmly in the spotlight. \nForeign donations were down on previous years, according to the AEC data, but several other prominent China-linked figures donated. \nProperty company Hong Kong Kingson gave $710,000 to the Liberals and $150,000 to Labor. The firm is run by Australian-Chinese property billionaire Chau Chak Wing, who donates six-figure sums most years. \nSally Zou, a Chinese mining and steel mogul who owns Aus Gold Mining and whose extended family has strong links to the Chinese government, donated $402,000 to the Liberals. \nThe Waratah Group, a Chinese-Australian company with interests in mining and property development, also gave the party $300,000. \nAnd well-connected businessman Huang Xiangmo's Yuhu Group, another property developer, donated about $200,000 mostly to the Liberal Party through various linked companies. Another businessman, Lawrence Luo, who is very close to Mr Huang, gave $50,000 to Labor in NSW. \nThe major parties also accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from the gambling lobby. \nThe Nationals took $14,800 from big tobacco company Philip Morris, despite recently saying the party had not accepted any such donations since 2014. Philip Morris also donated $20,000 to the libertarian Liberal Democrats. \nThe Health Services Union was Labor's biggest single benefactor, giving $389,232. \nPratt Holdings gave to both parties – but $830,000 to the Liberals and just $20,000 to Labor. \nThe Greens say the total amount of declared donations and payments made to Australian political parties since 1998 has now topped $1 billion.
