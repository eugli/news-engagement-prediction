At the same time, the retailer issued an outlook for fiscal year 2017 that fell well short of analysts' expectations.\nHere's how the company did:\n—EPS: $1.45 per share, excluding items, versus $1.51 per share expected by Thomson Reuters analysts' consensus.\n—Revenue: $20.69 billion versus $20.7 billion expected by Thomson Reuters.\n—Same-store sales: A decline of 1.5 percent versus the 1.4 percent decline expected by FactSet.\nA year earlier, Target earned $1.52 a share on $21.6 billion in revenue. The retailer's sales decline is partly attributable to the sale of its pharmacy business to CVS in December 2015. That pressure, however, is not the only reason the discounter is struggling to keep up with Wal-Mart .\nThe company's shares fell 11 percent in premarket trading.\n\"Our fourth-quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly changing consumer behavior, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores,\" CEO Brian Cornell said in a statement.\nThings are expected to remain tough for the fiscal year that just got underway. Target said it expects to earn $3.80 to $4.20 a share, compared with Wall Street's expectation of $5.37 a share. That includes a low-single digit decline in comparable sales.\nTarget will outline its plan to revitalize its business with shareholders Tuesday morning. At that meeting, it will outline the new financial model it will use in 2017, the company said.\nAs its low-price competitor has been growing traffic and sales through a series of investments in its stores and workers, the number of customers visiting Target stores has slipped. After reporting disappointing holiday results for November and December, the chain narrowly avoided a third straight quarter of lower traffic.\nThat's despite Target's elaborate Christmas strategy that included an increase in the number of advertisements focused on value, thousands of exclusive toys and an extended free shipping window. Even as revenue on Target.com shot more than 30 percent higher, the company's overall same-store sales fell 1.3 percent in November and December , causing it to walk down expectations for fiscal fourth-quarter comparable sales and earnings.\nDespite the company's lofty targets, results at Target have been choppy over the past year, as growth in focus areas like digital, fashion and wellness haven't been enough to offset weakness in media and grocery.\nMany investors have grown impatient with Target's lack of progress in food, which accounts for roughly 20 percent of sales. They had been expecting major changes in the division when Cornell joined Target in August 2014, given his background at PepsiCo .\nTarget is expected to outline plans to rejuvenate its business, including its grocery department, in a meeting with Wall Street Tuesday morning. John Zolidis, an analyst at The Buckingham Research Group, said he hopes that presentation will include a paring back of the company's previous goal to increase comparable sales by 3 percent annually, which it announced at last year's meeting.\n\"We believe Target shares could perform much better if the company meaningfully reduces expectations,\" Zolidis said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:53:23.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
