They tackled new projects to count down to the film in the hopes of making the in theater date arrive more quickly. Some fans decided to make all the art, fans like artist Vince Alvendia. He committed to 200 Days of Star Wars . That meant he completed a drawing a day leading into the premiere of Episode VII. \nAlvendia said the project nearly killed him and he finished some of the art minutes before midnight. Flipping through the results of the project on Tumblr, I have to say I think it was worth it. I like seeing my favorite characters in Alvendia’s cute and kind of sweet style. Look at Han and Chewbacca: \nIsn’t Chewie’s cranky face adorable? \nAnd hello, Jabba the Hutt drinking java. Jabba and java. Yes, please. \nMore examples from the 200 Days of Star Wars undertaking are in the gallery below. You can visit Alvendia’s Tumblr for more! \nDo you create any sort of fan art? If so, I want to see it. Whether you focus on a specific fandom or pull inspiration from multiple stories and mediums, I’d like to highlight what you do. If you’re interested in being featured in a future edition of Fan Art Friday , get in touch with me at [email protected] with examples of your work. If you’re not an artist, feel free to email me with recommendations for Fan Art Friday!
