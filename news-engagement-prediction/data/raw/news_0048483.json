Story continues below \nA report filed by City staff says the City’s visual identity had not been updated in more than a decade, and a simpler visual identity will not only be more easily recognized and understood by those for whom English is not a first language, but can be more easily adapted for social media channels. \nThe report says the City identified the opportunity to refresh its visual identity in June 2016 in light of changing city demographics and evolving popular culture, including the increased reliance on social media for communication and keeping pace with change. \nThe new wordmark sticks to the same colour scheme, but looks a little more streamlined. \nThe current City of Vancouver logo (on the left) side by side with the proposed new wordmark (on the right). City of Vancouver \nThe report says the company selected to design the new logo was the lowest bidder and total costs came in at under $8,000. It came up with a simplified wordmark, which, the report says, presents an “updated image of the City of Vancouver as a modern, innovative and highly desirable place to live and work.” \nCity staff are recommending a phased rollout of the new wordmark to gradually update City assets and other materials over the course of the year. \nThe City Council will be voting on the new logo on Wednesday. \nLet us know what you think and vote in our poll below. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
