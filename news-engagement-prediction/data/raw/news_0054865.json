It is a significant source of water in Arizona, supplying almost half the demand of metropolitan Phoenix.\nFor the study, researchers examined conditions on the river from 2000 to 2014, a period marked by one of the worst droughts in modern history. The river's flow during those years declined by 19 percent, about 2.9 million acre-feet per year compared with the long-term average from 1906 to 1999.\n“The future of Colorado River is far less rosy than other recent assessments have portrayed.”\nBradley Udall, Colorado State University's Colorado Water Institute At the same time, temperatures in the river's upper basin, where the largest amounts of snow runoff originate, averaged 1.6 degrees higher.\nResearchers said the warmer temperatures accounted for at least one-sixth of the water losses, or about half a million acre-feet per year. (An acre-foot is enough water to support about two households for one year.)\nThat was a conservative estimate. The heat's effects could have been much higher, accounting for as much as one-half of the losses, the researchers said.\n\"The future of Colorado River is far less rosy than other recent assessments have portrayed,\" said Bradley Udall, the study's co-author and a senior water and climate scientist at Colorado State University's Colorado Water Institute. \"A clear message to water managers is that they need to plan for significantly lower river flows.\"\nRELATED: Early snowmelt on the Rockies threatens Arizona's water supply \nUdall and Overpeck looked at climate models for the river basin and found agreement that temperatures are likely to continue to climb if greenhouse-gas emissions remain at current levels. The models were less certain about snow and rain in the basin, Overpeck said.\n\"Even if the precipitation does increase, our work indicates that there are likely to be drought periods as long as several decades when precipitation will still fall below normal,\" he said.\nUdall said current water planning underestimates the potential effects of climate change on future resources.\nThe study was published in the American Geophysical Union journal Water Resources Research. \nFULL COVERAGE: As The River Runs Dry \nCLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nAS THE RIVER RUNS DRY: THE SOUTHWEST'S WATER CRISIS Lake Mead facing water crisis | 1:27 At Lake Mead, America's most voluminous water impoundment when it was full and a lifeline to everyone from Phoenix to San Diego, a crisis has arrived.
