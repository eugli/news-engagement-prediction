Tech giants like Apple and Google, along with Uber, filed their arguments with the court late Sunday.\nTrump's executive order was founded on a claim of national security, but lawyers for the two states told the appellate court the administration's move hurts residents, businesses and universities and is unconstitutional.\nTrump, seen with first lady Melania Trump at a Super Bowl party Sunday, blasted U.S. District Judge James Robart, who issued the temporary stay on Friday against Trump's immigration ban. (Susan Walsh/Associated Press)\nMonday evening deadline The next opportunity for Trump's team to argue in favour of the ban will come in the form of a response to the Washington state and Minnesota filings. The 9th Circuit ordered the U.S. Justice Department to file its briefs by 6 p.m. ET Monday. It had already turned down a Justice request to set aside immediately a Seattle judge's ruling that put a temporary hold on the ban nationwide.\nIn the latest filing, lawyers for Washington state and Minnesota said: \"Defendants now ask this Court to unleash chaos again by staying the district court order. The Court should decline.\"\nThat ruling last Friday prompted an ongoing Twitter rant by Trump, who dismissed U.S. District Court Judge James Robart as a \"so-called judge\" and his decision \"ridiculous.\"\n\nThe judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!\n— @realDonaldTrump \nJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\n— @realDonaldTrump U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said Sunday that \"we don't appoint judges to our district courts to conduct foreign policy or to make decisions about the national security.\" Trump himself had offered an optimistic forecast the previous night, telling reporters at his private club in Florida: \"We'll win. For the safety of the country, we'll win.\"\nThe government had told the appeals court that the president alone has the power to decide who can enter or stay in the United States, an assertion that appeared to invoke the wider battle to come over illegal immigration.\n'We don't have so-called judges.' — Senator Ben Sasse Congress \"vests complete discretion\" in the president to impose conditions on entry of foreigners to the United States, and that power is \"largely immune from judicial control,\" according to the court filing.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, predicted the appeals court would not have the last word. \"I have no doubt that it will go to the Supreme Court, and probably some judgments will be made whether this president has exceed his authority or not,\" she said.\nIn his ruling, Robart said it was not the court's job to \"create policy or judge the wisdom of any particular policy promoted by the other two branches,\" but to make sure that an action taken by the government \"comports with our country's laws.\"\nProtesters in Hong Kong demonstrate against Trump's executive order on immigration on Sunday. People protested the order all around in the world on the weekend. (Bobby Yip/Reuters)\nWhatever the outcome and however the case drags on, a president who was used to getting his way in private business is finding, weeks into his new job that obstacles exist to quickly fulfilling one of his chief campaign pledges.\n\"The president is not a dictator,\" said Feinstein. \"He is the chief executive of our country. And there is a tension between the branches of government.\"\nThe Twitter attacks on Robart — appointed by President George W. Bush — prompted scolding from fellow Republicans as well as Democrats.\nKremlin demands apology over 'killer' comment   the president is doing a 'phenomenal' job \"We don't have so-called judges,\" said Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska. \"We don't have so-called senators. We don't have so-called presidents. We have people from three different branches of government who take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution.\"\nHowever, Pence defended the president, saying he \"can criticize anybody he wants.\" \n60,000 visas cancelled Trump's order applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen — Muslim-majority countries that the administration said raise terrorism concerns. The order had caused unending confusion for many foreigners trying to reach the United States, prompting protests across the United States and leading to multiple court challenges.\nThe State Department said last week that as many as 60,000 foreigners from those seven countries had had their visas cancelled. After Robart's decision, the department reversed course and said they could travel to the U.S. if they had a valid visa.\nThe department also advised refugee aid agencies that refugees set to travel before Trump signed his order would now be allowed in.\nThe Homeland Security Department no longer was directing airlines to prevent visa-holders affected by Trump's order from boarding U.S.-bound planes. The agency said it had \"suspended any and all actions\" related to putting in place Trump's order.\n\n\n© The Associated Press, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T14:22:19.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
