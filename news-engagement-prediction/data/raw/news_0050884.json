William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., filed a lawsuit in federal court Tuesday on behalf of the painting's artist, student David Pulphus. Clay argues that removing the painting from the Capitol complex violated the student's First Amendment rights. He announced the lawsuit in front of the U.S. Capitol early Tuesday afternoon.\nThis morning, I will be going to federal court to stand up for my constituent, and to defend the #1stAmendment pic.twitter.com/1LnNS2D8Pp — Lacy Clay MO1st (@LacyClayMO1) February 21, 2017 \nThe Missouri student's artwork, which shows cops as pigs with their guns drawn at protesters, won an annual congressional art competition.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts   news desk and delivered to your inbox.\n  Washington Examiner News Alerts.   alert soon! House Republicans filed a complaint with the Architect of the Capitol that it was offensive and violated the Capitol's rules about what paintings can be hung. The painting violated the House Office Building Commission policies that prohibit artwork with \"subjects of contemporary political controversy or a sensationalistic or gruesome nature.\"\nRep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., first removed the artwork and Clay hung it back up. After Clay hung it up multiple times after various GOP congressman took it down, it was finally permanently removed late last month.\n\"This is really not about a student art competition anymore. This is about protecting the Constitution,\" Clay told reporters after it was first removed. \"I do not agree or disagree with this painting, but I will fight to defend this young man's right to express himself because his artwork is true for him and he is entitled to that protection under the law.\"\nRep.
