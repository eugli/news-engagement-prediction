For that reason I am delighted at the level of support we have secured for our attendance at MIPIM next month and I believe we can build on the success of last year’s event.”\nPlay video Last updated Tue 21 Feb 2017 Business Northern Ireland Belfast", "external_links": ["http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/739170153280249856/3NUxW0o1_normal.jpg", "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/C5L75c8W8AANRVI.jpg", "https://t.co/2x3wik8lYi", "https://twitter.com/JudeHill_utv/status/834005854525468674", "https://twitter.com/utvnews"], "published": "2017-02-22T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:10:55.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
