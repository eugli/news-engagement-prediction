Another $1 million will be spent on an anti-racism action plan. \nMulticultural Affairs Minister Robin Scott said the campaign aimed to heal divisions in the community. \n\"There is certainly a new-found vigour for some political movements that are seeking to divide and to look to fear in order to propagate political views where they exclude some Victorians. We don't believe in that,\" he said. \n\"I think in the world at the moment, there are a series of uncertainties, whether they be economic, whether they be issues around violence or fear [of] terrorism. \n\"Some unfortunately seek to exploit those fears to get people to fear others within the community, the vast majority of whom in fact are law-abiding citizens who are committed to the community they live in and love Victoria.\" \nMr Scott said he hoped the campaign would lead to a more inclusive community. \n\"We're hoping to prevent racism as it occurs throughout the society, whether it be in schools. We've seen a number of incidents on public transport,\" he said. \n\"Really what we're wanting to do is ensure that as many people as possible within the community feel that sense of ability to contribute, and through that contribution to belong.\" \nHe said Victoria had strong multicultural communities, but the Government should not be \"complacent\". \n\"We've had a great history of building a successful multicultural community, but there are clearly people that have felt excluded,\" he said. \n\"There are very serious consequences ... if we lose the support that we have for a diverse, inclusive community. \n\"I think the vast number of Victorians are good, decent people who reject discrimination, but no-one should be subject to racial abuse.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:15:36.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
