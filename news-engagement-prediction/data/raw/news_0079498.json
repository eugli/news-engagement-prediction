And now, Taapsee has decided to sponsor the eatery, which has been named Pink Cafe. The eatery joint will employ only women in pursuit to send a positive message to have women pledge for equal rights especially in smaller towns. \nIn a statement, Taapsee revealed, “When I heard of the idea, I was impressed how a film can turn into an inspiration at so many levels. It’s rewarding when someone takes a positive impact of a film and converts that into reality with an initiative like this cafe for instance. I heard the idea and instead of just encouraging them I wanted to do more. And thus I did my bit by contributing to the cafe and I can only wish luck to them and hope to encourage more such initiatives in the future.” ALSO READ – Amitabh Bachchan’s Pink is the movie India needed the most in the year 2016, here’s why \nPink is a courtroom drama, which also features Amitabh Bachchan , Kirti Kulhari, Angad Bedi, Andrea Tariang and Piyush Mishra.
