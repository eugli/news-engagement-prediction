Those finalists, which include a host of future Division I talent with offers from elite programs, are Detroit Cornerstone Health and Technology's Jamal Cain, Detroit East English Village's Greg Elliott, North Farmington's Amauri Hardy, Kalamazoo Central's Isaiah Livers, Grand Rapids Christian's Xavier Tillman and Powers North Central's Jason Whitens. \nThe winner will be announced March 20 and honored at the Free Press. Here are the brief resumes for each of the players: Buy Photo \nDetroit Cornerstone's Jamal Cain before a game against Wayne Memorial on Dec. 6, 2016, at Wayne Memorial high school.

He entered the season No. 2 on the Free Press' Top 100 list of players in the state and is the fifth-best recruit in Michigan, according to ESPN. \nDetroit East English Village's Greg Elliott.

He has proven he can take over offensively, eclipsing the 40-point scoring mark in several games this season. Buy Photo \nNorth Farmington's Amauri Hardy (Photo: Kimberly P. Mitchell, DFP) \n• Hardy, a 6-3 four-star point guard headed for Oklahoma State, chose the Cowboys over 10 other offers, including Eastern Michigan and UDM. He came in at No. 6 on the Free Press' Top 100 players list and has helped North Farmington to a 13-3 record this season. Buy Photo \nIsaiah Livers is a four-star forward from Kalamazoo Central.

He is considered a Top 150 player by most recruiting outlets and debuted at No. 3 on the Free Press list. \n• Tillman, a 6-8 four-star power forward , is the top-rated prospect in the state, according to recruiting experts, and chose to stay close to home at MSU. He's ranked a top-90 recruit by all major recruiting services and appeared No. 1 on the Free Press' Top 100 players list. \nJason Whitens Powers North Central (Photo: Special to the Free Press) \n• Whitens, a 6-5 swingman from the U.P. , has Division II interest as well as interest from bigger programs as a preferred walk-on. His Jets have won back-to-back Class D state titles and haven't lost a game in three seasons — in both basketball and football. 1 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:46:12.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
