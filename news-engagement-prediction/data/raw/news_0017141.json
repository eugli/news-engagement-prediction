There's really no other way to explain the out-there visual for the bouncy reggae-tinged track co-written by Sia and featuring Skip Marley, grandson of reggae legend Bob Marley. Directed by Aya Tanimura, the adorbs clip features a hamster emoji bouncing over the lyrics (\"so comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble/ So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble\") as a pair of hands delicately cook up micro-burgers and teeny spaghetti for a rodent family. Is KP making a statement about the state of our world with the repeated cuts to hamsters running endlessly on wheels? Who knows? The thing is damn cute, though. Perry is slated to perform the song on Sunday night (Feb. 12) at the 59th annual Grammy Awards. \"Chained to the Rhythm\" is the first track from Perry's upcoming fourth album release, and her first single proper in six months. She's been teasing the song this week with a global campaign in which fans have have been hunting for disco balls playing the song all over the globe. The track, produced by Max Martin, is the follow-up to \"Rise,\" which synched with NBC's coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, and peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped Billboard's Dance Club Songs chart, her 16 consecutive No. 1 on the survey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:17:53.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
