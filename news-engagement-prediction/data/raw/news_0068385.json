Boasberg wrote in a summary judgment on Tuesday, after reviewing the disputed records in private. \nNone of the redacted emails contained “hints of nefarious government action or motive in responding to that conduct,” the judge wrote. \nJudicial Watch president Tom Fitton told Politico the organization was happy the court reviewed the documents, adding that the group is “evaluating the opinion and considering” an appeal. \n“We remain curious about the documents,” Fitton said. “The PR effort remains troubling and something that we think is in the public’s interest to know.” \nFitton said he expects the Trump administration to be “more transparent” on the issue of Clinton’s emails, calling the Obama administration’s actions “completely lawless.” \nBoasberg was appointed to the US District Court for the District of Columbia in 2011 by President Barack Obama. He was the judge who ordered the initial release of 14,000 records from Clinton’s private email server, following a lawsuit by Judicial Watch. Since 2014, he has also served on the US States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Court.
