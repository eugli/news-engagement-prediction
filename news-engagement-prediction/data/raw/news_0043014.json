A decade ago, I experienced symptoms that meant I was pre-menopausal. Worried, I went to my gynaecologist on Harley Street. She took a blood test, and a few weeks later I went back for the results. ‘The good news,’ she said, ‘is that you still have oestrogen, at least for a couple more years. Enjoy your hormones!’ The problem is, I had never enjoyed my hormones. God, who would? The angst of wondering whether a boy has noticed you; the terror of a party; a snog; the putting on of a bikini. Worst of all, female hormones mean you put up with men who spout nonsense and unfulfilled promises, who are boring and insolvent and unfaithful. Female hormones mean you are eager to please, nurturing, generous, tolerant, subservient, and doomed to disappointment. Now that the hormones have disappeared (along with the fat in my buttocks), now that I’m a brittle-boned husk with all the emotion of Siri, I’ve discovered an inner cantankerousness that knows no bounds. The problem is, I had never enjoyed my hormones. God, who would? The angst of wondering whether a boy has noticed you; the terror of a party; a snog; the putting on of a bikini With no ‘caring’ hormones coursing through my veins, I talk to tradesmen, shopkeepers, plumbers and policemen with the intonation of Barbara Woodhouse on a really bad day. It really gets results: they don’t just sit, they roll over. I’m invisible, too, and have found this not a drawback but a superpower. Who on earth wants to be called ‘love’ by a man who weighs 20st and is wearing a vest, or to have to wait by the phone for decades for Him to call? Who wants heat coursing through their veins when you discover a text on his phone from another woman, when you can have ice instead? To be post-menopausal is to be truly liberated: from nonsense, from being in a contest you never wanted to enter in the first place. When pop star Rihanna posts online that ‘Liz Jones is a menopausal mess’, or a younger female rival writes that my first name should really be ‘Nana’, I punch the air, because if the only thing a younger woman can accuse you of is not having died, they are displaying only their own lack of imagination. They are jealous they’re still in the race, while you are past the finishing post, not even having broken a sweat (we PMW no longer perspire; the saving in Dove products is enormous!). It’s a shame men don’t go through the menopause. Instead they shuffle on, wrinkled and ridiculous. PMW are powerful: just look at Angela Merkel and Theresa May. They’re not sexting. They’re ruling the world. Share or comment on this article 21", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T09:41:21.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
