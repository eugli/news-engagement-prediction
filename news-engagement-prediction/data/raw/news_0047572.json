But the two women were able to convince a judge that it was in Elaan’s best interest to give Collins the same legal parental rights as Bakht. \n“Lynda was involved from day one and her role was sort of ever-expanding,” Bakht, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, told CTV News Channel on Tuesday. “Elaan really relates to Lynda…like in a child-parent relationship.” \nWhen Bakht decided to have a child on her own, using a sperm donor, Collins, who also teaches law at the University of Ottawa, volunteered to be her birth coach. Complications during birth left Elaan with severe disabilities that include mobility and cognitive issues. Collins was there every step of the way, helping Bakht adjust to her new life and raise the boy. \nAs soon as Elaan was born, “I really just kind of fell in love (with him),” Collins told CTV News Channel. \n“He’s an amazing person. Basically, everyone who meets him falls in love with him.” \nAs Collins became more and more involved in the boy’s life, “I took on a parental role and we just eventually decided that we wanted to legalize that.” \nThe declaration of parentage means that Collins can make medical and legal decisions about Elaan’s care, just as Bakht can. \nBakht said, formalizing Collins’ role in her life “was important for a number of reasons.” \nAs a single parent, Bakht said she always worried about Elaan’s fate if something were to happen to her. \n“And when you have a child with disabilities, that’s a fear that is very prominent,” she said. “And I was just thrilled that Lynda was willing to be the other parent, be there in case something happened to me.” \nAbout five years ago, Collins sold her house and moved into a condo directly above Bakht’s. \n“We live a pretty average family life, other than sleeping time,” Collins said. She sleeps in her own apartment, but the family spends their evenings, weekends and holidays together. \n“We didn’t plan it that way, but it happened organically.” Photos Friends and colleagues Lynda Collins and Natasha Bakht are now co-mothers to Elaan. Elaan developed severe disabilities following complications during his birth.
