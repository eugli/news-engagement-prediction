Ram Yavne at 2016 Jpost Conference: Israel's strategic situation in the Middle East, Hezbollah weapons in Lebanon Nasrallah's remarks Tuesday morning days came after he called on Israel to dismantle its nuclear reactor in Dimona, warning that Hezbollah missiles were capable of hitting the facility. Nasrallah made a similar threat against Haifa's ammonia tank last year, saying that a missile hitting the facility could have the affect of a nuclear bomb. Earlier in February, a Haifa court ordered the tank closed , citing the security threat. Speaking in a televised speech commemorating Hezbollah's slain leaders, Nasrallah said that Hezbollah sees Israel's emptying of the ammonia tank as a sign that it fears the Lebanese Sh'ite group.\"I call on Israel not only to empty the ammonia tank in Haifa, but also to dismantle the nuclear reactor in Dimona. Our military capabilities will strike Israel and its settlements,\" he warned.In 2006 Israel fought against Hezbollah in the 34-day Second Lebanon War .Since then, hostilities between them have been limited to occasional firing across the border and reported air strikes by Israel against Hezbollah leaders and military equipment in Syria, where the group is fighting in support of President Bashar Assad.
