(Julio Cortez/AP) Thursday, February 9, 2017, 9:27 AM \nDear Chris Long, \nIn September it was time for you to speak up — and you did. And now it is time for you to standup — and you should. \nYou are receiving this open letter with the hope that you will publicly refuse to visit Donald Trump's White House and show solidarity with your teammates Martellus Bennett, Devin McCourty and Dont'a Hightower — all of whom will sit the visit out. \nYou are receiving it because in a pathetic sea of NFL white silence this year, you are one of the only white NFL athletes who publicly seemed to \"get it\" after Colin Kaepernick took his national anthem stand. \nYou are receiving it because your extended words on Kaepernick's stance conveyed a level of respect, sincerity, and acknowledgement of white privilege rarely ever expressed by a white NFL player. \nAfter hearing your words, Colin spoke of the value of having white athletes speak out and expressed his deep appreciation. He said: \n\"I think it was huge that Chris stood up and took that stand. I don't know if he realizes how much that means to this movement and trying to get things changed.\" \nBut Colin also expressed that your verbal solidarity did not get the attention it deserved. Kaepernick said: \n\"I saw Chris Long spoke out about it, but no one wants to talk about what he said and him bringing that to the forefront and speaking out against it.\" \nColin is correct. Your ESPN interview largely flew under the radar. Instead of discussing what you said, most outlets simply reprinted your \"perspective\" and \"thoughts\" without framing or commentary. \nSo before we get back to the White House, let's identify the key points that stood out: 1. You showed respect and empathy for Kaepernick and NFL peers \n\"I respect my peers. I respect Colin. Colin really put his reputation on the line and he's taken a beating. I'm just going to listen to my peers because I respect those guys, and I can't put myself in their shoes. I'm proud of my teammates for standing up for what they believe in.\" 2. You separated your own personal anthem stance rather than impose it on Kaepernick \n\"I respect the anthem. I would never kneel for it. We all come from different walks of life and think differently about the anthem and the flag and what that means. But I think you can respect and find a lot of truth in what these guys are talking about, and not kneel. Those aren't mutually exclusive ideas.\" \nChris, can you give Drew Brees a call, and explain \"mutual exclusivity\" in greater detail? Martellus Bennett has been the most outspoken member of the Patriots about his objections to visitng the Trump White House. (Steven Senne/AP) 3. You also identify oppression as \"systemic\" and an individual desire to improve them \n\"If we're saying there are incidents of oppression in this country, systematically or individually in this country, I don't think saying, 'Well, in country X, Y or Z it's 10 times worse' is making things any better. I think that may be true, but why can't we improve? \n\"Systemically\" is just one word, and can get lost in the sauce. But it includes police oppression, mass incarceration, education system, housing, as well as banning Muslims. Thanks for including it. 4. You identify hypocrisy between perceived symbolic support for military, but not actual support \n\"We're concerned about the feelings of our vets, and I certainly am, but let's treat our vets better on a daily basis. Why aren't we outraged about the lack of benefits they get? How do we treat our vets when they come home? We should be outraged about those things on a daily basis.\" \nThis last point was critically important as United States Veterans like Walter Scott, India Kager, Richard Chamberlain — all killed by police after they returned home. Yes, we should be outraged. 5. You acknowledge your white privilege \n\"I don't think that by acknowledging as a white male that America isn't the same for me, maybe, as it is for everybody, the same great place, that we're complicit in the problem or that we're saying America isn't a great place.\" \n… However, that white complicity part is always dependent on level of silence. 6. You respect the values, intelligence, perspective and courage of your teammates \n\"I play in a league that's 70% black, and my peers, guys I come to work with, guys I respect, who are very socially aware, intellectual guys, if they identify something that they think is worth putting their reputations on the line, creating controversy, I'm going to listen to those guys.\" \nKeep on listening Chris. This is what your Pro Bowl teammate Devin McCourty said on Monday: \n\"I don't feel accepted in the White House\" he wrote in a text message to TIME. \"With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won't.\" \nMcCourty, and now Hightower aren't just anybody, but two of the Patriots’ best defensive players and defensive team captains. Will you follow their leadership? \nMartellus Bennett was the first Patriot to announce he would not go. Bennett told the Dallas Morning-News, \"People know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter.” OK, let’s follow Bennett on Twitter. \nTuesday he treated us to a 90-minute tweet storm that contained a delightful series of tweets on youth empowerment (\"You don't have to be good at sports young man. Go upstairs and finish practicing that trombone), and rebuking those who say \"stick to sports.\" Bennett tweeted: \"I'm going to speak my mind because guess what… that's right for a looonngg time my ancestors didn't have a voice.\" \nAfter Bennett and McCourty announced their stance, Rolling Stone ran the headline \"More Black New England Patriots Players Say They Won't Visit Trump.\" Patriots owner Robert Kraft has a strong personal connection to President Donald Trump. (Winslow Townson/AP) \nThis headline, which specifies 'Black' is both accurate, but also very sad commentary on white NFL players. The moral bar has been set so low for white athletes that nothing is expected. \nOverall, at least 48 NFL players, including Bennett and McCourty, have knelt, sat, or raised a fist during the national anthem on game day, none of them were white. \nAnd to my knowledge, you were the only one to provide clear thoughtful verbal solidarity in its place. \nAnd now there is President Donald Trump. \nTrump is an easy call. \nTrump should eliminate many of the conflicted issues that kneeling for the anthem might raise. \nFor many players, kneeling for the anthem was a bold personal step. \nRefusing to visit Trump is not. \nNever mind that your quarterback Tom Brady, your coach Bill Belichick, and your owner Robert Kraft have all expressed support for Trump. \nFrom your past comments, you know damn well that they are all wrong. \nNot only wrong, but dangerous. \nWhile you were celebrating, Ex-KKK grand wizard David Duke tweeted: \"Can White people celebrate that the greatest football player in NFL history is White and an open Trump supporter?\" #SuperBowl \nThe Patriots are quite popular with white supremacists. Patriots linebacker and captain Dont’a Hightower is taking a pass on visiting the White House. He also skipped a 2014 visit with President Barack Obama. 'Been there, done that,' he said of visiting the White House, which he did after winning a national championship in college with Alabama. (Howard Simmons/New York Daily News) \nNeo-Nazi Richard Spencer, the man who coined the more respectable term \"Alt-Right\" tweeted: \"Brady and Belichick are about to win bigly for Trump, the #AltRight, and White America!\" \nIn a normal universe, this would be extremist fringe talk instead of public policy. But Trump has gone \"full-Nazi\" in hiring Steve Bannon as his Chief Strategist, and has been \"systemically\" implementing white nationalistic policies ever since . \nIt is time for you to stand up in solidarity with your black teammates against Trump. \nAs Brady knows himself, skipping presidential visits is nothing new , but boldly declaring why is still rare. \nThe Trump support from Tom, Bill, and Robert did not stop Martellus, a first-time Patriot like yourself, from taking his stand. \nHere is what Martellus's brother Michael Bennett of the Seahawks said earlier this year . \n\"You need a white guy to join the fight,\" Bennett told the Seattle Times. \"The white guy is super important to the fight. For people to really see social injustices, there must be someone from the other side of the race who recognizes the problem.\" \nBennett's principle still applies, but the anthem barriers you stated do not. \nYou recognized the problem. Now it's time to act on it, and stand up to Trump with your black teammates. \nThat time is right now. \nSincerely. \nChuck \nP.S. \nSaw your great tweet: \"Flint should piss us all off (understatement). I hope we as NFL players can help in the future.\" Me too. Through your foundation's WaterBoys initiative aimed at providing clean water in rural East Africa. Would be great if Flint becomes your next stop.
