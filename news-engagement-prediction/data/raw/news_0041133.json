Palaniswami's confidence motion on Saturday. \nSpeaker Dhanapal said the confidence motion got 122 votes in favour. \nAfter former Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam declared on February 7 that he had been forced to resign by AIADMK interim general secretary V.K. Sasikala, the party split up into two camps â€” one on the former Chief Minister's side and the other supporting Sasikala. \nGovernor Ch. Vidyasagar Rao, after Sasikala was convicted by the Supreme Court in a disproportionate assets case, invited Mr. Palaniswami, nominated by Sasikala, to form the government. Two days after the swearing in ceremony on February 16, the Chief Minister moved a confidence motion in the House. \nThe confidence motion, however was not a smooth affair. \nThe House had to be adjourned twice as the Panneerselvam faction and opposition MLAs demanded secret ballot, which was rejected by the Speaker.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:02:54.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
