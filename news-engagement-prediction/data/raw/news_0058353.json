A \"two-state solution\" to the decades-old conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is the declared goal of their leaders and the international community.\nIt is the shorthand for a final settlement that would see the creation of an independent state of Palestine within pre-1967 ceasefire lines in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, living peacefully alongside Israel.\nThe UN, the Arab League, the European Union, Russia, Australia, and, until last week , the US routinely restate their commitment to the concept.", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/welcome-mr-netanyahu-the-first-israeli-pm-to-visit-australia/news-story/047d61e185967150349c6f93cc1831eb", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7F16/production/_92443523_464x2.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4266/production/_94789961_gettyimages-643558582.jpg", "https://apanaustralia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/statement_netanyahu_signatories_for_release_final.pdf", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3AFA/production/_94789051_gettyimages-643536632.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-38421026", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-38987028"], "published": "2017-02-22T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:22:35.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
