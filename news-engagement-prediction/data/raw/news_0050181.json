About 61 percent of crashes that occur while turning or crossing an intersection involve left turns, as opposed to just 3.1 percent involving right turns.\nLeft turns are also three times more likely to kill pedestrians than right ones, the New York Times reported, according to data collected by New York City's transportation planners.\n\"A left-hand turn is also less fuel efficient,\" Jack Levis, UPS Senior Director of Process Management told CNN, \"because your car's idling longer, which is also not good for your vehicle.\"\nUPS does not ban left turns outright, says Levis: \"We will make left-hand turns, but not ones that are unnecessary. We don't need to go in circles all day long by making only right-hand turns. We have tools analyze the number of left-hand turns for each route, and we can work out which ones are avoidable.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/nyregion/17walk.html?_r=0", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/world/ups-trucks-no-left-turns/?iid=ob_homepage_deskrecommended_pool", "http://tomvanderbilt.com/the-book/", "https://www.pressroom.ups.com/pressroom/ContentDetailsViewer.page?ConceptType=PressReleases&id=1426329559785-791", "https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811366"], "published": "2017-02-19T12:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:10:22.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
