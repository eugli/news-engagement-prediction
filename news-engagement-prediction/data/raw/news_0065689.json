The donors in question reportedly include Harendra Singh and his city lease for the Water’s Edge restaurant in Queens and real estate investor Jona Rechnitz. \nDe Blasio has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, saying everything was done with the advice of his legal team. \nCBS2 has been staking out the offices for de Blasio’s attorneys for the past several days as he has arrived and left. \nCBS2 reached out to the Mayor’s office for a response. The mayor’s office said it had no comment. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:07:19.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
