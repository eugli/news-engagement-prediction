GRANT MATTHEW \nA missing German tourist survived on Mt Taranaki for two days with only a water bottle and a packet of skittles. \n\"About a kilometre down my track I came across a faint voice just calling out 'hello' and I just called back until I found her,\" Hakaraia said. \nHe recognised the woman, who has not been named, from a photo and said he was \"pretty stoked\" for her. GRANT MATTHEW/Fairfax NZ \nHakaraia heard a faint hello from the woman and called out until he found her. \nDespite her three day ordeal of being alone in the bush, surviving off a packet of Skittles and a bottle of water, the woman was only suffering from mild dehydration and was in high spirits. \n\"With the weather coming in I don't think it would have been in her favour at all, not being very bush ready,\" he said. \nHe said a wave of relief came over the woman when she realised she had been found. STUFF.CO.NZ \nA German tourist missing since Monday morning has been found safe. \nAfter giving her the water, chocolate and scroggin he had in his pack, they began to walk back up the track he had just cut to get to the carpark where he drove her up to the visitor centre to be checked by ambulance staff. \nHakaraia said her friend, who had been waiting at the visitor centre for news, was happy to see her. \n\"There was lots of German going on, I didn't understand a single word,\" he laughed. GRANT MATTHEW/Fairfax NZ \nThe missing tourist, left, has been reunited with her friend. \nFinding her and taking her to safety was a good feeling, he said. \n\"I'm just glad that she's safe.\" \nHis boss, Tristin Dodunski from Dodunski Forestry Services Ltd, said it was \"bloody lucky\" that Hakaraia found the woman as he was supposed to be on the second line down through the bush, but had jumped onto the first line by accident. \nA packet of Skittles sustained the missing woman for two days. \nArea Commander Inspector Keith Borrell said the woman had decided to walk the 2-3 hour Ngatoro track but lost her way and became disorientated as the bush became thicker the further she walked. \n\"She's believed that she's following the Ngatoro track which goes down to a carpark lower down the mountain but there are some of the DOC tracks that run off that that she's somehow ended up following one of those and that's how she's become lost,\" Borrell said. \n\"She's tired and a little bit dehydrated but otherwise her spirits are high and she's walking around in pretty good spirits considering she's spent days in the bush,\" Borrell said. GRANT MATTHEW/Fairfax NZ \nThe German women appear relieved their ordeal is over. \nA full-scale search for the woman began on Tuesday with teams on foot, the Taranaki Community Rescue Helicopter in the air and six search and rescue workers travelled up from Whanganui to take part. The Air Force and searchers from Palmerston North also joined the search on Wednesday morning. \nAir Commodore Darryn Webb, the Air Component Commander, said an NH90 helicopter from the Royal New Zealand Air Force's 3 Squadron in Ohakea flew police search teams to locations around the mountain and also conducted an aerial search of the area. \n\"The desire to help runs through our Defence Force â€“ from humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to search and rescue missions. We do our best to help the local community, in New Zealand and overseas, in any way we can,\" he said. \nSearch teams were out until midnight on Tuesday and stayed overnight in a hut near the visitor centre to get an early start. \nWhen news of the woman's rescue spread around the search teams, they filtered out of the bush back to the hut with smiles on their faces. \n\"It's just the best feeling,\" said Cleo Berryman, who had travelled up from Whanganui with SAR. GRANT MATTHEW \nOn Tuesday morning police launched a search and rescue and missing persons inquiry for a German tourist on Mt Taranaki. \nBorrell said they hadn't had the chance to talk to the woman about what she did to survive during the night, but they would be having a debrief with her once she was fed and rested. \n\"She wasn't really prepared to spend any overnight time in the bush, she had a drink bottle and a packet of skittles to go for a walk,\" Borrell said. \nShe was almost found on Tuesday when the rescue helicopter flew over her head but Borrell said she wasn't able to signal them as she was surrounded by bush. POLICE \nThe German tramper who was missing on Mt Taranaki. \n\"It shows we were searching in the right area,\" Borrell said. \nAfter being checked over, the woman and her friend had a bite to ear before heading back to their car. \nWhile her trousers were muddy and she looked tired, they both had big smiles on their faces. GRANT MATTHEW/Fairfax NZ \nThe woman was last seen at the North Egmont Visitor Centre. \n\"I'm just tired, I want to go home,\" the woman said. \nBorrell said DOC workers had been aware the woman was missing and had continued on with their work on the mountain while keeping an eye out for her. \nA DOC worker was also at the Police headquarters and was helping to co-ordinate with them. GRANT MATTHEW/Fairfax NZ \nSAR teams searched tracks on the mountain all day on Tuesday but found nothing. \nHe said they had begun to fear for the woman's safety as the search began on Wednesday morning, with the weather forecast to become worse on Wednesday evening. \n\"The longer the search went on the more concerned we were getting because as I said, she wasn't prepared equipment-wise to stay overnight in the bush,\" he said, \nHe said the woman's friend, who had been waiting at the visitor centre, had described her being found as \"the best day of her life\". GRANT MATTHEW/Fairfax NZ \nSearch teams were walking tracks in and around the visitor centre. \nPolice had also been in contact with the woman's family to let them know she was safe. \nBorrell said the incident highlighted the need for people on the mountain to let others know where they were going and to make sure they were well equipped for any conditions. \nMore than 40 people were involved in the search, including Search and rescue teams from Taranaki, Whanganui and Palmerston North. GRANT MATTHEW/FAIRFAX NZ \nA search and rescue mission involving teams on foot and the Taranaki Community Rescue Helicopter was launched on Tuesday morning and grew throughout the day. \n\"The fact that she's gone out there is fine, the thing for us is if you go for even a short walk in the national park, you tell someone of your intentions and that's what she didn't do on this occasion,\" he said. \n\"So if she had gone up to the visitor centre and written in the intentions book where she was going to walk it would have given us a better clue of where she was when she went missing, and that's the big thing is if you're going into this national park, please tell someone where you're going and your expected time of arrival of the walk.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T07:44:55.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
