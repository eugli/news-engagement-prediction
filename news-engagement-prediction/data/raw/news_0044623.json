There are already targeted treatments, like primers and putties made to help purge skin of dirt and grime, and the latest one I've got my eye on? The Estée Edit Pore Vanishing Moisturizer, which is the label's follow-up to its fan-favorite Pore Vanishing Stick . However, what separates this pore-minimizer from the rest is quite precisely the fact that it is a moisturizer, so it also has hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid (to plump skin and diminish fine lines) and vitamin E so you can create a smooth, flawless canvas with your a.m. moisturizer alone. It's also spiked with zit-busting salicylic acid, so it helps prevent any future breakouts, too. And just like the Estée Edit's pore-targeted treatment before it, this one is made with particles that not only wick excess oil, but also diffuse light to make for the appearance of a blurred, selfie-ready complexion, Sarah Creal, the creator of the millennial-friendly, Estée Edit line, tells Allure.com. It's almost like a finishing powder, but \"this isn’t the old-fashioned powder effect we're used to—it’s fresher and invisible,\" says Creal. \"This matte moisturizer and primer gives skin a natural healthy finish.\" You May Also Like Skin Kardashians Bio-Oil And like other mattifying moisturizers on the market (such as editor-favorited GlamGlow Volcasmic Matte Glow Moisturizer ), this one sops up excess oil as it smooths over skin, leaving behind a smooth, even finish without a hint of shine. Perhaps it's the cream's matte DNA (or maybe it's magic?), but by mid-day—a time when my forehead tends to glisten in all its glory—my T-zone was still relatively smooth and shine-free. While, yeah, there was a hint of sheen, I'm gonna give this magical moisturizer the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up any \"brilliance\" to the fact that my desk is filled with sunshine on the 31st floor of our building.
