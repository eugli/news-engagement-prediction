These people reportedly vow to offer a broom at the Pataleshwar temple if their diseases are cured.\nCelebrated every year in the honour of the Hindu God, Shiva the meaning of the word ‘Shivratri’ literally translates to the meaning, ‘Great night of Shiva’. Dedicated to the worship of Lord Shiva, Maha Shivratri is one of the most auspicious festivals for Hindus across India and abroad.
