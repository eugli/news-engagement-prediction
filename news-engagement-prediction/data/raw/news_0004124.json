They also urged everyone to show up to the public comment portion before council begins to voice their opinions in person to the mayor and council. \nEarlier today, January 31, Hamilton County Sheriff Jim Neil (D) said that he did not support the ideas behind Cincinnati becoming a sanctuary city, some some bipartisan opposition to the legislation. \nWhile Mandel, Monzel, and Winburn know there is not much they can do at this point, they urge everyone to fight the legislation, with Mandel saying that he believes the \"silent majority\" agrees with him.
