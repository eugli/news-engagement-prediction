Though we love him so, so much on The Vampire Diaries , Ian Somerhalder may have misrepresented the past between his ex-girlfriend Nina Dobrev and his current wife Nikki Reed . \nWe don’t like calling Ian out like this, but we have to look at the facts. \nWe recall earlier this month when Ian, Nikki, and Nina shared a gasp-worthy photo on Instagram of the three of them getting dinner together. A post shared by iansomerhalder (@iansomerhalder) on Feb 7, 2017 at 1:26pm PST \n“After years of websites pretending these two badass ladies knew each other well and baseless, false information of back stabbing and hatred from low-brow websites filled the minds and hearts of fans... They finally were able to get together for their first real dinner,” Ian writes. \nBasically, Ian insinuates that Nina and Nikki haven’t really met before. \nBut, we know that’s not true, and there’s loads of proof, as The Vampire Diaries fans are quick to point out. @iansomerhalder \"First real dinner\" \"Pretending they knew each other well\" When Nikki has actually attended Nina's birthday parties. pic.twitter.com/DyWIgB54fX kels (@damonwithelena) February 7, 2017 \nFans flooded Ian with pictures of the two women not just meeting, but having dinner, and at Nina’s birthday party together. *THIS JUST IN* ian claims they had their first REAL dinner yet nikki has attended not 1 but 2 of nina's birthday parties and they've hungout pic.twitter.com/gehsnE6H75 hope || 14 days (@dobrevftdelena_) February 7, 2017 \nIn fact, Nikki and Nina have worked together before, too. \nNikki and Nina, who both play vampires on screen, filmed a PSA together about affordable healthcare. \nThat was way back in 2014, after Nina and Ian broke up but before Nikki and Ian got together. \nThese pictures from award show celebrations, birthday parties, the 2012 Super Bowl , and more show that Ian’s wife and his ex were definitely, at the very least, acquaintances, but it certainly looks like they were friends — even when Nina and Ian were dating. Oh Ian they're are so many pic of Nikki & Nina and you're saying they only met each other for their first dinner here. The BS you tell pic.twitter.com/iEgTChQWkk \nBy raising this issue, it seems Ian is only adding fuel to the fire regarding Nikki Reed betraying her friendship with Nina by dating Ian. \nNina and Ian, remember, were together for three years. \nSo while we love Ian’s message of spreading love and not hate, it seems like he was the one escalating the drama this time. \nThe Vampire Diaries Season 8 airs Fridays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint ’s coverage of The Vampire Diaries Season 8 below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:16:21.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
