Leaving the United Nations Convention on Climate Change would hamper the United States' cooperation with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, according to The Washington Examiner .\nThe scientists are arguing against the view that carbon dioxide polluted the atmosphere, saying it helps \"crops and other plants that nourish all life.\"\n\"There is clear evidence that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide is environmentally helpful to food crops and other plants that nourish all life. It is plant food, not poison,\" the letter reads.\nThe letter also criticizes previous government actions to address climate change as scientifically unjustified.\n\"Since 2009, the U.S. and other governments have undertaken actions with respect to global climate that are not scientifically justified and that already have, and will continue to cause serious social and economic harm â€” with no environmental benefits,\" the scientists wrote.\n  Issues  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:20:41.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
