The amount shall be deposited in the SEBI-Sahara refund account,” it said. \n“In case, a substantial amount is deposited by then, this court may intend to extend the time,” they said. \nThe bench also asked an international real estate firm, which has shown willingness to buy Sahara’s stake in New York—based Plaza Hotel for 550 million USD, to deposit Rs. 750 crore in the apex court registry before April 10 to show its bonafide. \nAt the outset, senior advocate Arvind Datar, appearing for the SEBI, told the bench that one of the properties mentioned relates to the stakes or shareholding of the firm in formula one racing team Force India, and it should be excluded from auction. \nHe said the SEBI had tried to auction some of the properties mentioned in the list but it was unsuccessful and suggested that an e-auction could be done. \nSenior lawyer Kapil Sibal, appearing for Sahara, submitted that the court can attach some of their properties as security and the group would give an undertaking that if it does not pay the amount in 22 months, these assets can be sold. \nTo this, the bench said, “Why cannot e-auction method be followed as is being done in auctioning of spectrum?” .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:02:59.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
