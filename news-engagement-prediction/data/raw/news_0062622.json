The tech giant might unveil the official date for the launch of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ smartphone at the Mobile World Congress 2017. Meanwhile, before the official announcement, Evan Blass has tweeted the spec sheet of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. According to the picture posted by Blass, the Galaxy S8+ device will reportedly carry a 6.2-inch Quad HD+ Super AMOLED ‘full rectangle’ display, or 6.1-inch when factoring in the rounded corners. \nThe Galaxy S8+ smartphone will reportedly get 4GB RAM and 64GB of internal memory and can be expanded using a microSD card. Interestingly, there is no information on the processor which will come in the Galaxy S8+. While Samsung has been stocking the initial supply of Snapdragon 835 processor, it is not clear if the company will use it in this smartphone. The leak by Blass also does not reveal anything about the AI voice-powered assistant Bixby. Amid all the negative hype Samsung recently found itself in, it does not appear to let it come in between developing some great new technology. It is hoping to make a grand comeback.

While the Galaxy S8 will feature a 5.8-inch display and Galaxy S8+ will have a 6.2-inch curved screen. There have been rumours that Samsung follows the Apple iPhone and ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack. Even the home button and fingerprint scanner could get moved to the back. The launch of the new smartphone is especially notable and will be watched all over the world because of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle. Due to that, even the pricing might be lesser than the Apple iPhone and Google Pixel phones. Please Wait while comments are loading...
