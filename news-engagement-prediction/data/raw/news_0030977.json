Dating to the completion of the north upper deck in the early 1980s, it has been among the crown jewels of college football stadiums. The on-campus setting, and the letters in the upper deck and all those Tigers paws just make it one of the great places to watch a game.\nBut boy, had it become dated in a number of important ways. So credit to Terry Don Phillips for the West End Zone vision and execution, and credit to Dan Radakovich for the more recent modernization. The place has so much pop now, particularly for night games.\nAP", "external_links": ["https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/kcb9cwtvkuoafl2npmqa", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/kcb9cwtvkuoafl2npmqa)", "http://clemson.rivalsfanstore.com/"], "published": "2017-02-11T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:50:33.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
