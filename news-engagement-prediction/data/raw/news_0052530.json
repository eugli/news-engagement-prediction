Shaw opted to much on a pie during the game (Photo: BBC) \nBack in 2013, he was involved in a bust-up with a rival Kingstonian fan which led to him leaving the non-league side. \nThe fan had been berating him for his weight, leading Shaw to leap over the advertising hoardings to headbutt the fan, which Shaw puts down to 'a bad day at work.' \nIt resulted in Shaw being sacked by Sutton, though he made a quick return a year later after a short stint with Gosport Borough and has juggled several roles at the club ever since.

Share this video \nHere are some other memorable moments from a colourful career. Bright prospect \nShaw was actually a striker starting out - and a pretty good one at that with time spent in Southampton's youth sides. \nHaving failed to make it at The Dell, Shaw dropped down the divisions and bounced from club to club. \nFirst it was an apprenticeship with Reading, then a move to Basingstoke and a loan with Bashley, where his life-changing switch of positions occurred. \n\"One day they had a goalkeeping dilemma and the manager said I had to buy a pair of gloves,\" Shaw told the Mail. \"We beat Salisbury 1-0 and I've been in goal ever since.\" Wayne Shaw talks to former goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer (Photo: Getty Images) Alan Shearer jokes about time together \nAlan Shearer has confirmed the two once shared the dressing room as youth team players for Saints. \nThe former England striker joked that both followed their dreams - just that Shaw's was less conventional. \n\"He did (play in the same team as me), absolutely. When we were 14 or 15,\" said Shearer before Sutton took on Arsenal in the FA Cup. \n\"I actually followed my dreams to the Premier League, and he followed his to the burger van, I think.\" Alan Shearer and Wayne Shaw together as young players at Southampton (Photo: BBC) Utility man \nWhile Shaw is known for being a member of the squad, he does various other jobs at the club, including sweeping the 3G pitch at Gander Green Lane and helping with coaching. \nShaw is at the club from Monday to Thursday before returning back to his home on the south coast. \n\"I have to turn off the floodlights each night at about 10pm so I sleep here on the couch on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays,\" Shaw revealed.

Well, one particular offer has come from a publication asking him to pose nude. \n\"A publication asked if they can photograph me naked,\" Shaw confirmed. \"Like, everything off, except a pair of goalie gloves, apparently. They said they'll position me in a way that covers me up, if you know what I mean.\" \nQuite whether he will accept the offer is unclear, for now Shaw will revel in his newfound fame as Sutton begin to move on from their FA Cup fairytale.
