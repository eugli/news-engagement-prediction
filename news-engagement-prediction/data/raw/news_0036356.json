Mr Justice Cobb gave the decision at the family division of the High Court (Picture: Photoshoot) \nKirklees Council had persuaded a judge to allow the baby to be taken into emergency care without his parents even knowing the hearing was going on. \nThe mother, in her 20s, suffered from minor mental health problems and learning difficulties and the father had in the past been aggressive to others. \nBut staff at the special care baby unit where he was cared for in the days after his delivery had expressed ‘no child protection concerns’. \nMaternity ward medics had told the council they were anxious about the couple’s long-term ability to care for their baby. \nJust before the baby was due to be discharged from hospital into his parents’ care, the council rushed to court and obtained an emergency care order. \nThe judge was told that the parents were ‘on notice’ of the hearing and had ‘agreed’ to their baby being taken away from them.
