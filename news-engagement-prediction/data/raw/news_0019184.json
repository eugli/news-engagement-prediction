Standing with DeVos is her husband, Dick DeVos. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) A government website that explains a key federal law for students with disabilities was not working on Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’s first morning in office, leading to anxiety among special-education advocates who are monitoring her views on the issue.\nBut an Education Department spokesman said what happened to the site was just a glitch.\nThe spokesman said the agency was made aware of the problem early Wednesday and is working to fix it as soon as possible. “The site was not taken down,” he said, adding that there have been server issues related to the site since at least Jan. 27.\nThe site lays out student rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Act, or IDEA. DeVos stumbled over questions related to IDEA during her Jan. 17 confirmation hearing, first suggesting that states could decide whether to enforce the federal law, and then saying she had been “confused” about it. DeVos has since pledged to enforce IDEA.\nMany people have closely watch federal websites since President Trump’s inauguration, when pages related to climate change, civil rights and LGBT rights disappeared from the White House site.\nProbably not a good sign that https://t.co/2W607R23QO doesn’t work\n— Audrey Watters (@audreywatters) February 8, 2017\nMore than a little creepy that https://t.co/pW8ywKv6Ml is no longer live.\n— Thad Domina (@ThadDomina) February 8, 2017\nBREAKING: Our children's future.
