(Photo: AP) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW YORK â€” The Lego Batman Movie commanded the Presidents Day weekend box office, staying No. 1 for the second straight week, while the China-focused The Great Wall failed to show much muscle in North America. \nAccording to studio estimates Sunday, Lego Batman topped the weekend with $34.2 million, sliding only 35% from the previous week. The animated movie will cross $100 million cumulatively on Monday. 'Lego' franchise builds a shared animated universe with humor, heart \nFifty Shades Darker pulled in $21 million in its second week, again slotting in behind Lego Batman. \nThe Great Wall, the most expensive film ever made in China, grossed $18.1 million. That's a poor result for a movie that cost $150 million to make. But Great Wall has already been a hit in China, where it made $171 million. \nFinal numbers are expected Tuesday. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
