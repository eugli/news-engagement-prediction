Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nPolice are hoping a hitman can help them solve the Jill Dando murder case, nearly 18 years after she was gunned down outside her home. \nA retired detective told how he had spoken to the hired hand who claimed to know the brutal criminal behind the killing of the Crimewatch presenter that shocked Britain. \nMark Williams-Thomas said he handed the hitman a list of around 100 potential suspects and asked if the murderer was on it. He indicated it was – but did not reveal the name, fearing his life would be in danger if he did. \nHis voice disguised and talking on ­condition of anonymity, he said: “There are names here that I recognise. And there’s one in particular that stands out to me. But I wouldn’t identify that person because it’s very dangerous. I’m sure that they would come after me.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now NEW leads discovered for Jill Dando's murder Share this video Watch Next \nWhen asked who he thought killed Jill, who was shot aged 37 outside her home at Fulham, South West London in April 1999, the hitman replied “Certainly someone professional. Highly dangerous, I’d say.” \nFormer Surrey Police detective constable Mr Williams-Thomas, now an investigative ­journalist who exposed Jimmy Savile as a ­paedophile, had access to the police investigation files on Jill’s case. \nHe urged officers to follow up leads and drain a canal for the murder weapon and claimed he had uncovered evidence to suggest the killer’s name is in the original case files.

He told hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby the Met said it would “act upon” information he gave them. \nMr Williams-Thomas also spoke to the woman who found Jill dead on her ­doorstep. Describing the “most horrific scene”, she said: “She was lying in a very strange position, and there was blood. I knew she was dead. It looked professional.” Browning semi-automatic 9mm pistol (Photo: PA) \nDespite having all the hallmarks of a hit, loner Barry George who lived nearby was convicted of the murder in July 2001. But was freed after being acquitted in 2008. \nMr Williams-Thomas said he believes key leads were ignored after George’s arrest. \nHe said: “I’ve never reviewed a case where there is so much information that was never followed. People need to start to investigate some of it.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:26:38.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
