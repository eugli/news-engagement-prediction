Shocking images of an argument between the couple, in which Mr Saatchi had his hand on her throat, were published that summer, quickly followed by news of their divorce. At the time Mr Saatchi laughed off the incident as a 'playful tiff', and accepted a police caution for assault.

Nigella split from her ex-husband, Charles Saatchi, in 2013 following a very public breakdown that included a picture of him grabbing her by the throat Sources close to Saatchi, now aged 73, had suggested he was willing take his ex-wife to court in order to reveal the ‘truth’ about their break-up following the release of a series of photographs showing him with his hands on her neck. But he later revealed he had decided not to sue former wife Nigella as he wanted to 'get on with his life'.
