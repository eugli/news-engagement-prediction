'Playing with fire' \nUS officials said the sanctions, targeting 13 people and 12 companies, were in response to last Sunday's missile test and what they called Iran's \"continued support for terrorism\". \nThey are the first Iran sanctions of Donald Trump's new presidency, who has signalled a tougher stance on Iran than the Obama administration. Image copyright @realDonaldTrump \nMr Mattis had more strong words for Iran while visiting Japan. \n\"As far as Iran goes, this is the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world,\" he told reporters. \n\"We have seen their [Iran's] misconduct, their misbehaviour, from Lebanon and Syria to Bahrain and to Yemen and it's got to be addressed at some point,\" he added. \nBut he went on to say that despite the recent tensions he saw no need to boost troop numbers in the Middle East. \n\"We always have the capability to do so, but at this time I don't think it's necessary,\" he said. 'We will never initiate war' \nIran has denied that its missile test violates a UN Security Council resolution or the nuclear deal it struck with international powers, including the UN. \nIn response to the US sanctions, Iran announced restrictions against US companies and individuals \"involved in creating and supporting extremist terrorist groups or are helping in the killing and oppression of defenceless people\". \nIran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has also said the Islamic Republic was unmoved by US threats. \n\"We'll never initiate war, but we can only rely on our own means of defence,\" Mr Zarif wrote. Image copyright @JZarif \nUS officials have suggested more action could follow. Mr Trump has been a vocal critic of the nuclear accord, which saw Iran agreeing to curb its sensitive nuclear activities in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. \nIran is also among the seven Muslim-majority countries included in a controversial US travel ban.
