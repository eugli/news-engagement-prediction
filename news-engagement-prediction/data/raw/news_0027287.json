(Photo: Nick Oza/The Republic)\n COMMENT EMAIL MORE I agree with several points Rhonda Cagle makes in her op-ed (\" The case for Arizona charter schools (or at least school choice)\" ): Charter schools are not private schools and can be a viable alternative for some, all children are unique, and every child deserves an individualized approach to education.\nHowever, Cagle lost me when she referred to them as \"stewards of public trust and public funds.\"\nAlthough public, charters are not governed by locally elected school boards directly responsible to parents, voters and taxpayers. As of 2011–12, for-profit Education Management Organizations – some of them big corporations headquartered outside our state – ran 50 percent of Arizona charters.\nALLHANDS: The simmering charter school war\nThey also don’t have the same regulatory requirements as districts such as the need to undergo state-run audits and be included in the Auditor General’s annual district efficiency report.\nFurthermore, charters are not required to hire state-certified teachers, and most have waivers exempting them from competitively bidding out contracts and purchases. These exemptions for accountability and transparency contribute to the potential for significant fraud, waste and abuse.\nLet's debunk 3 other charter-school myths Additional issues include:\nI’ve never heard anyone claim charter schools don’t serve ANY special education students (SPED); rather, that they don’t serve the same number of SPED students as districts. Amy Silverman, writing in the Phoenix New Times , found in 2012-13 districts spent $763 per student on SPED services versus charter spending of $331, and that of the “520 charter schools in operation, 273 didn’t serve a single child with any of the four most profound disability areas.” “Charters make it clear special needs students aren’t wanted,” Silverman wrote. \"It’s passive-aggressive, and it’s prevalent.” Not surprising, given that SPED students are more expensive to educate (for every dollar districts receive to educate SPED students, they spend $1.50 ), and many take the same test as other students, eroding plans for keeping test scores high. Charters do divert money away from districts, partly because when a student leaves a district, 19 percent of the fixed costs associated with that student remain. Also, because when parents move their children from districts to charters, many no longer support the district in their communities on bonds and overrides. Charter schools don’t improve student achievement across the board. A Brookings Institute study of Arizona charters released in 2015 said, “We don’t find any evidence that charters have much of an impact on reading scores at any grade level.” District schools are best for diversity I believe district schools offer the best solution to provide every child every opportunity to succeed, and turning our back on this bedrock of democracy isn’t in our children’s or our nation’s best interest.\nYes, some charters provide a valuable service, e.g., those that serve students who have exhausted other options. Often, though, charters are less the “incubators of innovation originally envisioned” and more autocratic (empowering management versus teachers) and more segregated (by race and income).\nMy Turn: School vouchers don't always save money (or offer real choice)\nSchool choice saves - not costs - Arizona cash: Column\nIf we are to bridge the divisions plaguing our country, we must improve our ability to see things from others' perspectives. We do that by improving our understanding of each other.\nDistrict public schools, where children of various races, ethnicities and socioeconomic status learn side by side, offer the best opportunity for that. They offer the best opportunity to ensure the education of all our children, that which Thomas Jefferson said is the “only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.”\nCarrie Lifshitz has a master's in education and a doctorate in neuroscience.
