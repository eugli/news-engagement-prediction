Emily Javadi \nShe was rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where she died about an hour later. \nHer mother Karen Javadi said her family was a part of the court proceedings and delivered the victim impact statement. \n“I wanted him to know that he owes us, to improve the condition of this world, because he is occupying a space that should be Emily’s.” \nKaren Javadi said they have started the Emily Javadi Foundation , which awards several scholarships a year to needy students. \n“Some great things have happened, but the pain we feel will never go away. We will always suffer that loss, but we are focusing on positive things. That’s what’s going to keep us going,” Javadi said. \nAs part of his probation, Elwell will not be allowed to drink, must attend Alcoholics Anonymous and will be required to speak at drunken driving support groups. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
