The David Beckham 7 Fund specifically has raised millions of pounds and helped millions of vulnerable children around the world. David Beckham has given significant time and energy and has made personal financial donations to the 7 Fund and this commitment will continue long term. \n“Before establishing the 7 Fund, David had supported Unicef and a number of other charities over many years, including donating his entire earnings from PSG during his time playing there. \n“David and Unicef are rightly proud of what they have and will continue to achieve together and are happy to let the facts speak for themselves.” \nMeanwhile, Unicef has said it is \"extremely proud\" of its work with Mr Beckham. \nThe charity praised the former England football captain for his efforts in raising awareness and funds for its causes and personally donating \"significant\" sums. \nHe was made a Unicef Goodwill Ambassador in 2005 and has appeared in several public campaigns for the charity. \nHis charitable fund has also carried out projects in Burkina Faso, Swaziland, Papua New Guinea and Cambodia to tackle issues including poor water and sanitation, malnutrition and HIV infection in mothers and children. \nUnicef said: \"As well as generously giving his time, energy and support to help raise awareness and funds for Unicef's work for children, David has given significant funds personally.\" \nThe charity said his charitable fund has raised millions of pounds since it was launched to mark the star's 10th year as an ambassador. \nAnd in June 2016 Beckham visited Swaziland to raise awareness of the drought affecting eastern and southern Africa. \n\"We are extremely proud of the 7 Fund and all it has achieved for children,\" the charity said. \n\"Since it launched in February 2015 it has raised millions of pounds for Unicef programmes and reached millions of people around the world with crucial messages about our work for very vulnerable children.\" More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:00:19.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
