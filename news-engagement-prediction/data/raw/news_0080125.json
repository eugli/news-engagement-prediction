People generally keep those thoughts to themselves when you’re paying them. Well, except in this case.\n‘Cutting corners’\nAn unnamed woman shared a screenshot of a conversation she had with a birth photographer who really seems to lack understanding about basic customer service.\nThe woman has clearly attempted to hire this person to take photos at her Caesarean and judging by the first message visible in the screenshot, the request wasn’t favourable received.\nThe mum-to-be can be seen defending herself in the screenshot, uploaded to the Breastfeeding Mama Talk Facebook.\nAmazingly, the photographer replies to this message with an incredibly rude and mind bogglingly offensive message.\n“A surgery isn’t birth my dear,” he or she wrote.\n“You aren’t giving birth. You have a surgery to your baby from your abdomen, That is not birth no matter how you swing it and I for one don’t want to be there to take pictures of it.”\nThen just to rub salt in the wound the photographer continues and says: “If you decide to give motherhood a go from the get, let me know and we can schedule your session.”\nOuch.\nNaturally, people aren’t happy\n“This is not okay would love to know who this photographer is!” Breastfeeding Mama Chat wrote beside the image.\n“Moms who have had a C-section you’re just as much a damn good mother as anyone. How you gave birth and you did certainly give birth does not determine your worth as a mom.#stopmomshaming.”\nTheir readers also felt the same way.\nmedia_camera The photographer said the woman choosing to have a C-section was 'surgery' and not 'giving birth'.\n“Wow! As a C-section mom this makes me so sad! My daughter was breech and my OB opted for a C-section at 37 weeks due to pre-eclampsia! Turns out she was breech because her cord wasn’t long enough for her to turn. Had I attempted to turn her or deliver her it would not have worked unless the cord broke and most of us know how that ends,” wrote one angry mum.\n“Wow. If anything C-section mamma’s deserve more props. Awake during surgery & a longer/harder recovery with a newborn to take care of. How on earth is that cutting corners? I thought my 2 vaginal births were the easy way, even with their own complications for each one, major surgery (while awake) is not easy!” Said another.\n#stopshaming\nI will NEVER understand why people feel the need to insert their opinions into situations like this. What does anyone else’s birth have to do with you? How could this possibly affect your life in any way? We all have it bloody hard enough without adding on all of this extra nonsense, so knock it off people. Lest you find yourself facing a public shaming.\nThis article originally appeared on Kidspot and has been republished with permission.\nOriginally published as Mum’s shocking exchange with birth photographer", "external_links": ["http://www.kidspot.com.au/birth/labour/types-of-birth/mum-shocked-to-be-shamed-by-birth-photographer", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/717dafac455c56c36e068dc4317e8a14?width=650", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/pregnancy/mum-shocked-to-be-shamed-by-birth-photographer-over-caesarean/news-story/fafc8dac7e3e388516985f9fc0555a43", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbfmamatalk%2Fposts%2F1298775703504177&width=500"], "published": "2017-02-27T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:56:32.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
