Ad Feedback \n\"Fruit and vegetables have been shown to reduce cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and to boost the health of our blood vessels and immune system,\" lead author Dr Dagfinn Aune said. \n\"This may be due to the complex network of nutrients they hold. For instance they contain many antioxidants, which may reduce DNA damage, and lead to a reduction in cancer risk.\" \nThe vast array of beneficial compounds cannot be easily replicated in a pill, said Aune. \n\"Most likely it is the whole package of beneficial nutrients you obtain by eating fruits and vegetables that is crucial is health. \n\"This is why it is important to eat whole plant foods to get the benefit, instead of taking antioxidant or vitamin supplements.\" - Stuff ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:00:18.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
