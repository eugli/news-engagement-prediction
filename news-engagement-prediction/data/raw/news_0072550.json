When the UK was asked if we should leave or remain in the European Union, the collective answer was final Theresa May \nAccording to the Times, SNP chiefs want to hold the referendum as early as 2018, but if the Prime Minister agrees to any vote she would reportedly not allow it to go ahead until after the UK officially departs the EU in 2019. \nThe last “IndyRef” took place in 2014, with 55 per cent of Scots rejecting independence from the UK. \nBut despite Scottish voter’s Remain vote in the EU referendum, opinion polls show most Scots would still back remaining in the Union. \nThis has sparked claims Sturgeon has “painted herself into a corner,” according to senior ministers. GETTY The Prime Minister has urged Scots to reject the SNP's referendum calls at council elections \nThe Prime Minister has urged Scots to use forthcoming council elections to send a \"clear message\" to Nicola Sturgeon that they don't want another independence referendum. \nWriting in Holyrood magazine, the Theresa May said: “We will also be looking forward to the local elections in May, when voters across Scotland will have the chance to send a clear message to the SNP that they do not want a second independence referendum, by voting Scottish Conservative and Unionist on 4 May.” \nShe added: “When we take decisions on a UK-basis, whether in a referendum or a general election, every individual has an equal voice. \n“So in June last year, when the UK as a whole was asked if we should leave or remain in the European Union, every voter had an equal say and the collective answer was final.” Related articles ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:30:23.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
