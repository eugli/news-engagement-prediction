It’s actually part of a strange phenomenon known as “peak blackness.” \nAt least that’s the theory postulated by “Daily Show” correspondent Roy Wood Jr. on Monday’s show. \n“‘Peak blackness’ is a rare metaphysical anomaly that can only occur when an amalgam of black excellence comes together at the same societal intersection,” Wood explained to host Trevor Noah. \nWhen Noah seemed confused, Wood sputtered, “It’s when a whole lot of dope black shit happens at the same time.” \nWood explained further: “Going into last night, you had Black History Month, Beyoncé’s pregnancy with Jay’s twins, multiple black movies were nominated for Oscars and Frederick Douglass came back to life.” \nWood believes this is a glorious time. \n“We are operating at maximum levels of ‘blacktivity’ that haven’t been seen in decades.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST 29 Classic Black Movies To Watch In Honor Of Black History Month 29 29 Classic Black Movies To Watch In Honor Of Black History Month 1 29 \"The Loving Story\" This moving 2011 documentary tells the real story of Richard and Mildred Loving, the interracial couple who went on a legal crusade in 1958 to secure the right to be married to each other.
