In the name of Beyoncé losing to Adele, Beyoncé losing to Beck , the Atlanta Falcons losing to the New England Patriots and three years of #OscarsSoWhite , Moonlight won best picture and people of color, queer people and queer people of color finally felt validated by the Academy Awards.\nFor every black person whose had to watch white mediocrity be praised this feels like the ultimate win I'm screaming\nWhite people when their mediocrity didn't get them a win: https://t.co/KWKh5Bntn6\nThis ancestral magic came in full affect #moonlight #Oscars For the culture https://t.co/nstTtBYyiz\nLGBT PEOPLE OF COLOR DID THAT THEY WON BEST PICTURE\nWHAT ELSE IN MY LIFE SHOULD I BE DOUBLE-CHECKING NOW. I'VE NEVER BEEN PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT\nNow La La land I'ma let you finish but Moonlight had the best music video of all time! #Oscars2017\nWHAT ELSE CAN WE TAKE BACK FROM THE CLUTCHES OF WHITE MEDIOCRITY\nMe @ the oscar being snatched from La La Lands hands and being given to Moonlight\nY'all thought White mediocrity was gone have its place in the spotlight again huh? https://t.co/fLOqgCIrZF\nFile under: \"Receipts\nThis is not a joke. Moonlight has won best picture.\" https://t.co/wtNvD0UT80\nMOONLIGHT (2016) WINNING MEANS EVERYTHING REVOLUTION N BLACK POWER BEAT WHITE MEDIOCRITY\nBLACK MAGIC CAME AND HEXED WHITE MEDIOCRITY https://t.co/5k6hd5RL7d\nThe truth is, even though Moonlight will be remembered in trivia games and Wikipedia pages as the best picture of 2016, for now, they also have to live with not having the moment of their name being read from the card. They were not allowed to deliver uninterrupted speeches. Instead, Barry Jenkins just stood in awe and uttered out a few phrases .\nEven with Moonlight winning, the talent behind the film still didn't get the respect it deserved.\nIn the moments following Moonlight 's win, now's the perfect time to revisit one of the most iconic lines of Shonda Rhimes' Scandal .\n\"You have to be twice as good as them to get half of what they have!\"\nSource: CollegeGirlKEY/YouTube Watch the moment below.\nWATCH: Moment where crew/cast of 'La La Land' realizes a mistake had been made and 'Moonlight' actually won Best Picture. #Oscars https://t.co/WCCopwsJ66\nMic has ongoing Oscars coverage.
