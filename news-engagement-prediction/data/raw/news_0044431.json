There are so many phones out there in the market that look similar to the iPhones. Some of these even have the software that is modelled after the iOS, which powers the iPhone. So it is surprising that so far this year none of the Android phone makers have copied the best feature of the iPhone that Apple introduced with the iPhone 7 Plus. And this feature is the unique combination of the dual cameras on the rear cover, which makes the iPhone 7 Plus such a joy to use. \nThe phones with the dual-camera setup are plenty in the world of Android. In fact, Android phones did it before Apple put two cameras in the iPhone 7 Plus. There are phones like the Huawei Honor 8, Huawei P9, LG G5, which have the two-camera feature. But none of them do it in the unique way Apple's iPhone 7 Plus implements it. That makes all the difference. Also Read: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus review: The best iPhones Apple has made \nWhen Apple released the iPhone 7 Plus last year, I was sceptical about its two cameras. But after using the phone extensively, I have realised the brilliance of what Apple is done. The problem with the phone cameras is that their field of view and their focal length is fixed. So with all the phones you get these images with a wide angle perspective. This angle works well for the landscape and street photos. But it doesn't work for portraits or the kind of photos that where you want to highlight the subjects, bring them up front. The wide angle photos lack the dynamic nature of pictures that are close-ups. They are not striking. Also Read: iPhone 7 Plus camera can surpass a DSLR camera. Occasionally \nApple solved this issues somewhat with the iPhone 7 Plus. Of course, the smartphones can't match the beauty of a DSLR camera or a serious compact camera like the Canon G7X II. But by putting a 56mm separate lens on the iPhone 7 Plus Apple utilised that second camera slot in a brilliant way. The 56mm gives the phone users a perspective that is more intimate, and helps them click images that are more striking. By putting a 56mm separate lens on the iPhone 7 Plus Apple utilised that second camera slot in a brilliant way. The 56mm gives the phone users a perspective that is more intimate, and helps them click images that are more striking This is in stark contrast to LG's approach, which put an extra wide lens as a second camera in the LG G5. Or the approach of Huawei, which tends to use the second camera for monochrome photos.\nGiven how good is the iPhone 7 Plus second camera from the usability perspective, I was hoping that Android phones will soon follow Apple's step. The \"zoom\" lens on the iPhone 7 Plus makes photography more fun. But so far the signs are that no one from Android world is seemingly adopting Apple's iPhone 7 Plus trick. The LG G6, which is set to be unveiled this week at the Mobile World Congress, has two rear cameras. But they seem to be two regular wide-angle cameras. Then there is the Samsung Galaxy S8, which is supposed to come in March -- March 29 to be precise -- and that too is seemingly won't have anything like the iPhone 7 Plus camera. In fact, the Samsung phone seems to have just one regular camera. Also Read: Smartphones with best camera: Apple iPhone 7 \nGoogle, which makes Pixel phones, is usually a little shy at adopting big new features so chances are that this year's Google phones too may not have the camera set-up that is inside the iPhone 7 Plus. \nBut the bigger surprise for now are the Chinese phone makers. These companies are usually quick to adopt the features that Apple puts in iPhone -- hint: the force touch -- but so far they seem to have shown no inclination in bringing the 56mm or similar telephoto lens to their phones. \nI consider the dual cameras, all because of the 56mm lens on one of these cameras, the best feature of the iPhone 7 Plus. It is truly remarkable. It is surprising that so far none of the Android makers have decided to go for a something similar in their devices. Ideally, they should be copying this feature left and right because it is truly useful.
