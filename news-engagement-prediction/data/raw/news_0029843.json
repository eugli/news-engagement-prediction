Tom Brady (AFP) \nUpdated at 8:01 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:01 a.m. ET \nTom Brady will turn 40 before next season but the Super Bowl MVP doesn't see retirement in the near future. \n“I’d like to play until my mid-forties,” Brady told The MMQB . “Then I’ll make a decision. If I’m still feeling like I’m feeling today, who knows? Now those things can always change. You do need long-term goals too. I know next year is not going to be my last year.” \nOther than a torn ACL in 2008, Brady has been durable and shows no signs of diminished skills, especially with arm strength and accuracy. \nBrady told MMQB the secret to his longevity is complete devotion to diet and fitness. \n“I've worked hard to get a system in place that really works for me and I know could work for everybody else if they just did it,\" Brady told the site. \"That enables me to play 99 plays [in Super Bowl 51, the most of his career in one game] as a 39-year-old in the last game of the season. … Football to me is more than just a sport. It has become my life. Every choice that I make … what I have for breakfast, how I work out, all of those things. I love the game. I love playing.” Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T16:26:13.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
