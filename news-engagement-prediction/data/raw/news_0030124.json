The goal at the time was to represent the city’s ‘founding people,’ but it omitted the fact that indigenous people occupied the land as far back as 4,000 years ago, and were displaced 185 years ago.\nThe current flag features the symbols of the so-called ‘founding people’: the fleur-de-lys for its French origins, the Rose of Lancaster for the English, the thistle for the Scots and the shamrock for the Irish.\nThe red cross in the centre is also meant to represent the fact that Ville-Marie was founded as a Catholic city.\nIt is so far unclear how the flag will be altered, and even what symbol will be used to represent its indigenous roots.\nThe date of its unveiling is also unknown.\nPhotos Montreal flag", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T17:04:16.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
