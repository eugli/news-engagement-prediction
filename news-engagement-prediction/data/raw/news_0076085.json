Her stylist, Karla Welch, told The Hollywood Reporter prior to the awards ceremony that they were going for a \"pagan goddess\" look. \"There&apos;s a quietness to the look, but it&apos;s major,\" Welch said.\nStill, Negga&apos;s accessories made a loud statementâ€”the blue ribbon is part of the American Civil Liberties Union&apos;s new \"Stand With ACLU\" initiative, launched earlier this week. According to THR , \"the campaign encourages Hollywood stars to wear a Stand with ACLU blue ribbon as a symbol of solidarity with the nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, which has worked for nearly 100 years to defend and protect individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and law of the U.S.\"\nSupport for the ACLU has increased in recent weeks in the wake of President Donald Trump&apos;s immigration policies. (The organization raised more than $24 million the weekend following Trump&apos;s now-blocked executive order temporarily banning immigrants from seven countries.)\nWorth noting: The ACLU played a key role in Loving . The film, which is based on a true events, tells the story of an interracial couple who were arrested and kicked out of Virginia in 1958. The ACLU took up their case, which eventually went to the Supreme Court and resulted in the end of miscegenation laws in the United States.\nOther stars, including \"Hamilton\" creator Lin Manuel Miranda and supermodel [Karlie Kloss, have already been spotted with the ACLU ribbons on the Oscars carpet. Best Actor nominee Casey Affleck also rocked it sat the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday, and actress Sarah Paulson used her acceptance speech at this year&apos;s SAG Awards to encourage donations to the organization. \"Any money you have to spare, please donate to the ACLU,\" Paulson said on stage . \"It&apos;s a vital organization that relies entirely on our support.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.self.com/gallery/sag-award-activism", "http://www.self.com/story/aclu-receives-24-million-in-donations", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ruth-neggas-2017-oscars-dress-979184", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/aclu-blue-ribbons-2017-oscars-red-carpet-979073", "http://www.self.com/story/sara-elizabeth-dill-lawyer-travel-ban", "http://www.self.com/topic/donald-trump"], "published": "2017-02-27T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:29:50.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
