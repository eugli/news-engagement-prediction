(Yvonne Wenger/Baltimore Sun video) Yvonne Wenger members said Monday they want the state to give control of the Baltimore Police Department to local officials, part of a series of actions they think will help stem the tide of violence.\nCouncilman Brandon Scott said local elected leaders should not have to appeal to state lawmakers to adjust police policies and practices, such as setting up a community policing steering committee or redrawing the police district boundaries. \n\"The citizens of Baltimore think the City Council can change laws and enact policy,\" Scott said. \"The citizens of Baltimore hold us responsible. ... Why should the city of Baltimore be at the beck and call of the 90-day General Assembly ?\" \nThe council passed a resolution calling on the legislature to pass a bill that would transfer control. Scott said the Baltimore Police Department was founded as a state agency to provide a militia for Maryland and is the only local department controlled by the state. \nBaltimore Del. Curt Anderson is sponsoring the bill in Annapolis. \n\"I don't think it's the right thing for folks who live in Baltimore City to drive to Annapolis to affect change in the Baltimore City Police Department,\" said Anderson, a Democrat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:53:12.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
