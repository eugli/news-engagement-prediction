McPherson took on many roles in Detroit's art scene, including model, photographer, performer and volunteer who worked behind-the-scenes to ensure a particular event — whether it be the Detroit Dirty Show or the Michigan Renaissance Festival — was a success.\nMr. McPherson, of Royal Oak, died Wednesday of lung cancer. He was 44.\nCreativity was at the core of Mr. McPherson, said his longtime partner, Xaina Mulvihill. He was a conceptual photographer who worked and performed under the name \"Licentious\" and often pitched in to help other artists with their projects.\nMulvihill said Mr. McPherson's favorite shows to be involved with included Breaking Borders, DAMNED Exhibition of Enlightened Darkness, Detroit Dirty Show, Theatre Bizarre and Michigan Renaissance Festival. At Theater Bizarre, was he was well-known as a conductor on the Ghost Train, a sort of carnival ride.\nHe often helped set up and take down shows, and assisted in any other ways that were needed.\n\"He was very involved with the fetish community and the erotic community in Detroit,\" Mulvihill said.\nThe father of two worked for Peco, a company that builds parts for car washes. He was laid back and soft-spoken.\n\"People would call him quiet, but when he spoke, he had witty humor,\" Mulvihill said.\n\"He went above and beyond to make people happy. His mission in life was to make sure people around him were comfortable, especially the people who were important to him.\"\nDetroit fashion designer Benson Roberts said the loss of McPherson will resonate with Detroit's artistic community for a long time. He called him a \"shining son of Detroit.\"\n“In a city that challenges artists the way that Detroit does, Mike was unique,\" Roberts said. \"He was able to support and collaborate with other artists while simultaneously working on his own projects.\n\"His vision and ability to inspire were only surpassed by his kindness and compassion. He was honestly loved by everyone who knew him and he generously shared himself with all of us.\"\nMr. McPherson loved the colors black and red, Snickers candy bars, Marilyn Monroe and drinking Jack Daniels and Coke. His favorite band was Tool.\nA funeral service is being privately planned for intimate family. A memorial party will be held at 5 p.m. March 19 at the Tangent Gallery in Detroit.\nMr. McPherson is survived by his parents, Ernie and Pam McPherson; two children, Jake and Carissa; his brother Zack and Zack’s wife Jenny, along with their children Olivia and Wyatt; grandfather Keny McPherson; and Mulvihill and her daughter Jously.\nMetro editor Maryann Struman contributed to this report.\nContact staff writer Ann Zaniewski at 313-222-6594 or azaniewski@freepress.com.
