Price has been a fixture in that seat wearing his custom-painted bow ties and colorful suits. It's where he sits, cracking jokes and handing out bobbleheads of himself. Minutes later, he's grilling hospital officials and going on tirades about racism in America. \nBut on Tuesday morning, his seat sat empty for the first time in years, maybe decades, county officials said. Since he took office in 1985, Price has said, he's never taken vacation. \nEveryone at Commissioners Court knew where Price, 66, was sitting instead. He was seven blocks away in a different kind of court -- U.S. District Court -- for his corruption trial. Hows and whys: Looking back and ahead on John Wiley Price's corruption case before his trial \n\"It was very odd today -- his absence was very obvious,\" said Constable Roy Williams, who has been with the county for 27 years. \"It's been a long time since that seat has been vacant on a Tuesday morning.\" \nWhile Price's four colleagues ran the meeting without him, dozens of prospective jurors raised their hands to answer a questions about their ability to judge Price fairly. Could they avoid news coverage? Would they hold it against him if he didn't testify? \nCommissioner Elba Garcia said she felt the void to her right. She vowed to seek answers on issues that he was concerned about, such as Parkland Memorial Hospital's financial woes and treatment of patients. \nAt one point in the meeting, Garcia did call out asking for a Parkland representative, but he had stepped out. She later said that she was confident Parkland was addressing Price's concerns. Before the trial of his life, John Wiley Price isn't worried \n\"We have to be sure that District 3, which is Commissioner Price's district, gets to the table,\" Garcia said. \nPrice could be absent for as long as four months-- the anticipated length of his trial. During that time, Garcia said Price would likely keep up with county business and stay on top of things as best he can. \n\"He's a very focused person,\" she said.

(Andy Jacobsohn/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer \nCounty Judge Clay Jenkins said he wasn't concerned about the lack of representation for Price's district, which covers the southern part of the county and has mostly minority residents. Price is the first and only black Dallas County commissioner. Garcia is Hispanic; the other three court members are white. \n\"He'll stay focused on his district,\" Jenkins said. \"My district is the entire county so I focus on the entire county. I'll make sure that the people of that district -- I'll focus on them like I always do.\" \nPrice is charged with accepting nearly $1 million in bribes over a decade from businesses seeking contracts or other approvals from the county. If convicted of all charges, he could face up to decades in prison. \nPrice has vehemently denied the allegations. He has said after his acquittal, he'll be right back to work. What's next? \nKey upcoming dates in the John Wiley Price public corruption trial: \nToday: Jury selection starts, and could run through Friday. \nFeb. 24 or 27: Testimony expected to begin, soon after a jury is seated. \nJune 30: Prosecution and defense attorneys have agreed to wrap up the trial before this date.
