Coulter couldn’t think of anything, but said, “I think he should tweet more. I love his tweets. I love them so much. It drives the media crazy.” \nShe has no big issues with his staff and praised White House senior advisor Stephen Miller as her “favorite human being” and a potential 2020 VP candidate when Trump runs for re-election. \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:02:57.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
