The world's greatest sporting selfie?! ðŸ‘ŒIt's your 2017 Laureus World Sports Awards winners! #Laureus17 pic.twitter.com/VqS4QodhyP â€” #Laureus17 (@LaureusSport) February 14, 2017 \nBoltâ€™s selfie included a whoâ€™s who of sportâ€™s biggest names, including F1 champion Nico Rosberg, American Olympic heroes Michael Phelps and Simone Biles, Leicester Cityâ€™s Wes Morgan and Claudio Ranieri, and Chicago Cubs owner Thomas S. Ricketts. \nDeGeneresâ€™ selfie taken at the 2014 Oscars featuring a selection of Hollywoodâ€™s A-list actors like Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, Bradley Cooper, Meryl Streep, and Julia Roberts became the most tweeted image in history, shared by over three million people (and counting). If only Bradley's arm was longer. Best photo ever. #oscars pic.twitter.com/C9U5NOtGap â€” Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) March 3, 2014 \nBolt got a third straight Olympic sprint treble last year in Rio de Janeiro â€” although he was recently stripped of the 2008 relay gold because teammate Nesta Carter failed a doping test. \nBiles meanwhile won four golds and one bronze in Rio as she became the first gymnast to win the Laureus award since its inauguration in 2000. \nAmong other award winners, now retired driver Rosberg won the breakthrough of the year award, World Series winners Chicago were named team of the year, and American swimmer Michael Phelps had the best comeback with five Rio golds for an Olympic record 23 overall. \nThe winners, announced at a gala in Monte Carlo, were decided by a jury made up of members of the Laureus Academy made up of sporting legends.
