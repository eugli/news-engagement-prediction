More on this story \nCan settlement issue be solved? \nThe legalisation on Monday of a number of outposts has proved divisive within Israel and is likely to face legal challenges. \nThe attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, called the bill unconstitutional and said he would not defend it in the supreme court. \nCabinet minister Ofir Akunis said during a debate ahead of the vote: \"We are voting tonight on the connection between the Jewish people and its land. This whole land is ours. All of it.\" \nOpposition MPs shouted from their seats at members of the governing coalition who were speaking in favour of the bill and spectators raised a black cloth in apparent protest. \nPalestinians condemned the law. \n\"This is an escalation that would only lead to more instability and chaos,\" said Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. \nHe added: \"It is unacceptable. It is denounced and the international community should act immediately,\" \nThe UN Middle East envoy, Nickolay Mladenov, called on Israeli MPs to vote against the law, saying it would \"greatly diminish the prospects for Arab-Israeli peace\". \nThe Obama administration strongly condemned Israel's settlement programme, and some 6,000 new homes in the West Bank and east Jerusalem have been planned since the former president left office. \nMr Trump did appear last week to moderate his staunchly pro-Israeli position, saying that the construction of new settlements \"may not be helpful\" to the peace process. \nMore than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. \nMuch of the international community views Israeli settlements as illegal and an obstacle to the peace process. \nPalestinians want to form a state from the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, territories captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
