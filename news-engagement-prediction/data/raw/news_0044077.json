By Zee Media Bureau   16:36 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nNew Delhi: In November 2016, NASA launched a challenge called the 'Poop Challenge', calling all interested individuals to submit designs for a system that would help manage human waste in space. \nThe main purpose of the challenge was to develop a system that collects and routes human waste away from the body for up to six days without the use of hands. The system was required to be one that could be fitted into the spacesuit itself. \nOverall, NASA was looking for a system that collects human waste for up to 144 hours and routes it away from the body, without the use of hands. \nThe winning amount offered by NASA for the best design was a whopping USD $30,000! \nLooks like the wait is finally over, for the American space agency has found its winners! The prize money has been awarded to three individuals. \nThe top award of USD 15,000 for the Space Poop Challenge, went to Thatcher Cardon, a physician from the US, for his design of the MACES Perineal Access and Toileting System (M-PATS). \nTeam Space Poop Unification of Doctors (SPUDs) won the second prize of USD 10,000 for their Air-powered Spacesuit Waste Disposal System. \nHugo Shelley from the UK won the USD 5,000 award for sesigning SWIMSuit - Zero Gravity Underwear for 6 Day Use. \nSpacesuits provide a self-contained life support system and are worn for launch and entry activities, as well as spacewalks, to protect the crew from the harsh environment of space and any unforeseen circumstances. \nAs astronauts travel farther into the solar system, explorers may need to remain in their suits for several days. \nCurrently, astronauts living aboard the International Space Station (ISS) typically wear a suit for several hours during launch or landing, and the crew can return to Earth in a few hours or less if necessary. \nFor these occasions, astronauts wear a waste collection garment, similar to a diaper, under their spacesuits if they need to relieve themselves. \nHowever, the diaper is a temporary solution that does not provide a healthy option to protect astronauts for longer than one day. \n\"The ability to protect the crew while in a pressurized suit for such an emergency situation is one that has never before been tested in space and is critical for crew health,\" said Kirstyn Johnson, spacesuit engineer at NASA's Johnson Space Centre in Houston. \n\"It was invigorating to see the number of people interested and engaged in the challenge. From here, we'll be able to use aspects of the winning designs to develop future waste management systems for use in the suit,\" said Johnson. \nThe life support systems in spacesuits protect astronauts from many dangers, including a loss of cabin pressure inside the spacecraft, making it a necessary that a waste management solution must function without opening the suit. \nThe system must also be suitable for astronauts of both sexes and hands-free in the conditions of space â€“ where solids, fluids, and gases float around in microgravity and don't necessarily mix or act the way they would on Earth. \nThe judges selected the winners that were most promising for implementation with technology that engineers could potentially develop in the next three or four years. \nNASA engineers are in the early stages of suit system design for deep space and will test and develop different options before the agency settles on a final design for the suit systems, including waste management. \n(With PTI inputs)   16:36 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:04:27.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
