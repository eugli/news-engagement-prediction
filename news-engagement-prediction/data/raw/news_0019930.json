Tory MP James Duddridge tabled the motion tonight, branding Mr Bercow's attempt to interfere in President Trump's state visit 'wholly inappropriate'. It signals the growing anger in the Commons at the Speaker's behaviour and could cost him his powerful job. Earlier this week Mr Bercow dismissed calls to quit following his outburst against the controversial US President, who he branded 'racist' and 'sexist' in an extraordinary rant. John Bercow is to face a motion of no confidence after furious Tory MPs launched a bid to oust the Commons Speaker over his refusal to let Donald Trump address Parliament He expects a growing number of dissatisfied Tory MPs to add their names calling for Mr Bercow to go over the next 10 days when the Commons is in recess and said the Speaker could even be forced out before MPs return to Westminster on February 20. Mr Duddridge, MP for Rochford and Southend East MP told Sky News: 'He has overstepped the mark, he has overstepped the mark a number of times but this most recent incident - where he used the Speaker's chair to pronounce his views on an international situation in some quite detailed and lengthy manner is wholly inappropriate and it means that he can no longer reasonably chair, as Speaker, any debate on those subjects.
