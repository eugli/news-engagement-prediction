What makes them 'strong' is that they completely dissociate into their ions (H + and an anion) when they are mixed with water. Any other acid is a weak acid . There are only seven strong acids, so you might want to commit the list of strong acids to memory. Note some instructors may ask for the 6 strong acids. That typically refers to the first 6 acids on this list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:51:17.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
