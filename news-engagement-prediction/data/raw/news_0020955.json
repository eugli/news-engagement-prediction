They found that BLM Agent Dan Love used his Government position and authority to score 3 tickets to an illumanatti event known as Burning Man in 2015 for his family and girlfriend. The inspector General also found that Special Agent Dan Love also used government lodging where he and his girlfriend stayed, he also used Government vehicles to transport his family to and fro said event.\nWhen Special agent Love was finally caught in this abuse of government power, he tried to threaten and intimidate his fellow agents in an attempt to try and persuade them from exposing him to the Office of inspector general.\nFor those who are as yet unfamiliar with the Burning Man Festival, it is like nothing you’ve ever seen (and hopefully never will see). Founded on the Summer Solstice (a witchcraft holiday) in 1986 by a man named Larry Harvey it has grown from its humble beginnings of a small gathering of friends on Baker Beach in San Francisco to a week long festival (ending Labor Day weekend) that has been relocated to the Nevada Black Rock Desert, forming a temporary city. Boasting two daily newspapers and an unbelievable 40+ radio stations, Black Rock City’s population this year was estimated at about 30,000 inhabitants from every state in the union and quite a few foreign countries. Harvey claims that the Burning Man and the Black Rock City phenomenon originated from a creative way to ceremonialize getting over a broken relationship combined with an unprecedented social experiment in the unrestricted self-expression of art and life (later on you’ll see some of that ‘artwork’ ). One thing that he emphatically denies is that it is pagan based . I found this to be a laughable second-rate cover story. To me, the Burning Man origins obviously parallels ancient pagan celebrations when Druids burned humans in wicker cages as sacrifices to their gods at least eight times a year, on their eight major holy days, one of those of course being the Summer Solstice or Litha, a Celtic fire festival.\nLarry Harvey is responsible for all major aspects of the Burning Man Project; from a new central theme that it is given each year to overseeing the design and construction of the wooden man, to the layout of the city and so on.\nBurning Man 2001: Satan’s Birthday Party\nLas Vegas Nevada: On Wednesday Attorney Chris Rasmussen filed a Motion For Review of BLM Personnel Records after a scathing report released by the Office Of The Inspector General, said a Special Agent In Charge of the BLM was found to have committed Ethical Violations and Misconduct during an event in 2015 called “Burning Man” held in Black Rock Desert, Nevada.\nThe report contained points of interest for attorneys fighting an uphill battle in the Bundy Ranch case, especially the part about the Special Agent trying to intimidate and influence witnesses in his ethics investigation.\nDaniel P. Love, who is believed to be the Special Agent in Charge the report is referring to, was also the Special Agent In Charge of the Bundy Ranch Cattle Impoundment of 2014. Complaint after complaint was filed against Dan Love before, during, and after the protest, but failed to catch the eye of the Inspector Generals Office. This time the complaints came from within the BLM staff itself and it looks as though the “Super-Agent” will finally be held accountable.\nThis revelation came as no surprise to the people who live in States in which the BLM has taken on the role of Law Enforcement under the direction of Special Agent Daniel P. Love. Locals say they can attest that misconduct is an almost daily routine for the agency.\nChris Rasmussen, the Attorney of record for Pete Santilli, the journalist being held without bond after being swept up in a series of arrest stemming from the 2014 protest, wasted no time in demanding the court release the unredacted document filed by the Inspector Generals Office on January 30th, because he believes Dan Love may be the agent that was investigated and the Governments star witness in their case against Cliven Bundy and co-defendants.\nMr. Rasmussen says that if Daniel P. Love is the agent being charged in the Inspector General’s report, his client and other co-defendants have a right to know and be allowed to impeach his testimony, if he takes the stand.\nBLM Agent Daniel P.
