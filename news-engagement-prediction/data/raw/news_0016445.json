By contrast both Presidents Obama and George W. Bush got seven nominees approved in the hours immediately after inauguration, and by this point had at least a dozen in office. \nDemocrats say the blame lies with Mr. Trump , who they say has picked a Cabinet far outside the norm. \nOn Monday Democrats were mounting a filibuster to try to sink Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump ’s pick to head the Education Department, saying she was incompetent and ideologically incompatible. \nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer called two Republicans “profiles in courage” after they announced last week they would defect on the DeVos vote, opposing her confirmation. \nBut that will still likely leave a 50-50 deadlock that Vice President Mike Pence will break, confirming Ms. DeVos. \n“Now is the time to put country before party,” Mr. Schumer urged Republicans to break with Mr. Trump . \nMr. McConnell , though, countered that it was Mr. Schumer who was chasing after his party’s left wing, staging objections in order to appease liberal pressure groups. \n“The Democratic Leader and his colleagues are under a great deal of pressure from those on the left who simply cannot accept the results of a democratic election,” the Kentucky Republican said. “Unfortunately, many of our friends across the aisle have given in to these groups’ calls for obstruction.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:25:04.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
