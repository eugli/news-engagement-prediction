The film will first be released in Digital HD on March 24th, with the DVD, Blu-ray, and on-demand options following on April 4th. Lucasfilm The home releases will include a variety of special features. There’s several character featurettes, the film’s actors talking about Jyn, Cassian, K-2SO, Baze & Chirrut, and Bodhi & Saw. There are also several behind-the-scenes features that look at the creation of Rogue One , the future of the franchise, and how the film connects to the larger Star Wars universe. What doesn’t appear to be included is deleted scenes (of which there are apparently many ), nor any audio commentaries.
