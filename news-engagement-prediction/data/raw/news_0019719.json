Mark Warburton carries the can for deeper malaise troubling Rangers | Ewan Murray Read more \nThe Swedish international, who helped set up Dembélé’s third goal in Perth with a rabona pass, took Bitton’s ball down brilliantly with his right foot before turning and slotting the ball underneath Owain Fon Williams from five yards with his left. \nCaley Thistle remain the only team to deny Celtic victory in 30 domestic games this season but they arrived at Parkhead without a Premiership win in 13 games and they could not find their way back into the game despite starting with two strikers in Henri Anier and Billy McKay. \nThey resorted to crude tactics and were lucky to keep 11 men on the park as they racked up four bookings in 13 minutes. \nCarl Tremarco produced a blatant trip on James Forrest; Ross Draper tripped Brown off the ball right in front of referee Kevin Clancy; Iain Vigurs went in hard and late on Scott Sinclair and Gary Warren brought down Dembélé. \nThere was nothing they could do to stop Dembélé doubling Celtic’s lead on the stroke of half-time, although Fon Williams should have done better. \nThe former Fulham striker’s effort from a Forrest cutback was straight at Fon Williams, who was dropped for last weekend’s draw with Dundee, but the ball squirmed underneath the Welshman’s hand and over the line. \nDembélé’s second came five minutes into the second half after Sinclair turned well on the edge of the box. David Raven stopped him with a slide tackle but the ball fell kindly for Dembélé, who slotted into the far corner. \nThe 20-year-old nodded home nine minutes later after Forrest had beaten Brad McKay and hung a cross straight on to his team-mate’s head. \nForrest could have had one himself when he intercepted as McKay waited for Warren’s pass to reach him but the winger shot wide from 18 yards. \nInverness rallied but could not trouble Craig Gordon with several efforts on goal and Tierney got in on the scoring in the 86th minute after another assist from Forrest, powering a header home from 12 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T17:45:44.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
