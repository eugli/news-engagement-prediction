They also displayed a racist banner in the stands until the match referee intervened, ordering its removal. The match was stopped while stewards removed the banner, but warnings to fans issued over the Stadion Karlj Petar Prvi’s PA system failed to stop the abuse.\nLuiz was targeted throughout the match, and following the final whistle, he reacted by making an obscene gesture towards the fans, sparking a brawl between Rad and Partizan players. Staff from both teams broke up the fighting, but Luiz left the pitch in tears.\nPartizan Belgrade's Brazilian midfielder Everton Luiz leaves the field in tears.

According to their laws, “punishments for first offences bring a warning, fine or clubs being forced to play games in empty stadiums. A second offence, or one deemed ‘serious,’ could result in demotion, a deduction of points or expulsion from a tournament.”\nLuiz himself issued a statement following the match.\n“My family and I feel at home in Serbia and this is why I could not stop the tears after the game,” he said, according to Reuters. “I took 90 minutes of racist abuse and other insults from the terraces and thereafter I found myself in a cauldron of emotionless individuals who charged at me when they should have protected me. I want to forget this, refocus on football and urge everyone to say ‘No’ to racism.”\nPartizan Belgrade's goalkeeper Filip Kljajic (R) hugs Luiz.
