Rabbi Rachel Timoner officiated. The bride, who is 33 and will be taking her husband’s name, works at Averity, a technical-recruitment firm in Manhattan, where she is responsible for business development and recruitment.

I remember thinking: ‘Who is this girl? Does she have a question for everything?’” That woman turned out to be Ms. Herlands, who had arrived in New York a year earlier from New Orleans, where she worked at Tulane’s Criminal Law Clinic as a student lawyer, representing defendants charged with felonies.
