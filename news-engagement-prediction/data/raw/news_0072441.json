The wild pursuit was caught on camera. IndiaToday.in | Edited by: Mohak Gupta A + A - Screenshot: YouTube/Associated Press \nA bull escaped from a slaughterhouse and led police on a wild chase through the streets on Tuesday only to die on its way to a shelter. \nThe bull was hit with tranquilizer darts and it took two hours for the police to corner him. \nA spokeswoman for Animal Care Centers of New York City said the bull died en route to one of the agency's care centers. \nPolice said the bull had escaped from the Aziz halal slaughterhouse. No one answered a phone number listed there. \nThe bull would have been spared the butcher's knife had it survived. Mike Stura, the founder of Skylands Animal Sanctuary and Rescue in Wantage, New Jersey said that he was on his way to pick the bull up and take it to his facility. \n\" I was there trying to get him,\" Stura said. \"This is not the outcome I was hoping for.\" \nThe beast's break for freedom was covered live on local TV. \nFootage that aired on WABC-TV showed the black bull trotting briskly through a residential neighbourhood. \nThere were no reports of the bull causing any injuries during the chase, though it ripped the door off a car.
