As the track builds and Angelakos unleashes his falsetto, \"Hey K\" offers a few surprises, including a jazzier drum beat and an unexpected, yet seamless transition into an effervescent outro. \n\"Moonbeam,\" meanwhile, is quintessential Passion Pit; a short but frenzied instrumental anchored by a vibrant sugar-high synth riff that rushes underneath a steadier and sparkling lead. \n\"Hey K\" and \"Moonbeam\" follow three recently released Passion Pit songs: \"Inner Dialogue,\" \"I'm Perfect\" and \"Somewhere Up There.\" All five songs have been posted to the YouTube page belonging to the Wishart Group, Angelakos' new company offering legal, educational and healthcare support to musicians. \nWhile each track has also been tagged with #seaoflove in the description, it's unclear whether they're tied to a new Passion Pit album.
