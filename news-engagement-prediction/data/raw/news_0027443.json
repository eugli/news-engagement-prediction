So it was a very healthy, cathartic experience. And I think it paved the way for both of us to have great futures with no animosity or drama. Such a huge relief, to heal that. And I'm great friends with him and with his children. I love them, madly. Just huge love and respect for all of them.\" 25 John Legend and Chrissy Teigen (m. 2013–present) Steve Granitz/WireImage/Getty Images \nChrissy Teigen and John Legend first met on the set of Legend's music video for \"Stereo\" in 2006.

Sometimes I'm deeply in love with David and head-over-heels, and sometimes I question whether it's going to work out and is meant to be. It's like a business relationship, as well as a personal one; we have a business together and that’s maintaining our love for one another.\" 33 Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie (m. 2014–2016) Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic \nAngelina Jolie and Brad Pitt (often dubbed \"Brangelina\") first met on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith and eventually took their onscreen romance offscreen when they began dating in 2005.

It can destroy you. And you have to learn. It's a hard lesson. But you have to learn to back off and do as good as you can in your chosen profession. And don't screw it up.
