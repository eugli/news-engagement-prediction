Article continues below \nGiven the technique with which Luiz executed it, Liverpool could have few complaints about going 1-0 down. \nHowever, they did have one big issue with the goal - replays showed it was a rather contentious free-kick, but Mark Clattenburg clearly felt that Adam Lallana had fouled Eden Hazard. Article continues below Adam Lallana reveals exactly what he eats in 24 hours - and it's ridiculous \nLet's take another look: \nEveryone will have an opinion on the incident, but thankfully, we have the BT Sport pundits to analyse decisions like that. \nSteven Gerrard was as furious as you'd expect him to be. Did Clattenburg get it wrong? \nWhile former Premier League referee Howard Webb was on hand to discuss whether Clattenburg had got it right or not, Gerrard interjected first. \n\"I disagree with Mark's [Clattenburg] decision for two reasons,\" he told BT Sport, per the Mirror. \n\"One he miss-controls the ball, if that's in the penalty area you'd never get a penalty for it because he's miss-controlled it. So outside the box the rules have got to be the same. \n\"The contact is minimal, and he leans into [Adam] Lallana, so there is no way in the world that's a free-kick.\" Contentious decision \nWebb suggested that Clattenburg had not had the perfect view, but Gerrard added: \n\"Does he not take the touch into consideration? That it's gone ten yards in front of him, and he's drawn the foul. You said it yourself, he's drawn the foul, he was clever.\" \nClattenburg later made another decision in Chelsea's favour, but Diego Costa was definitely fouled in the box. \nEven so, the striker's penalty was saved by Mignolet, so that moment may be quickly forgotten about. \nAnd regardless of whether the first goal was deserved or not, Liverpool must still be thrilled with a point against the league-leaders.
