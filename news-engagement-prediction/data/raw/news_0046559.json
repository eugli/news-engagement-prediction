The track in question is titled “Caiphus Song” and makes for the perfect follow up to the already massive “World Is Yours” single. \nArtwork for the single was created by fellow musician Okmalumkoolkat and speaking on the track AKA remarked, “This is a song very close to my heart. It’s about fighting for a future with the one you love. I decided to call it “Caiphus Song” to honour him and the song “Matswale” which inspired me to write this at this particular point in my life and relationship.” Feb 21, 2017 at 7:35am PST \nGive “Caiphus Song” a listen here . We can’t wait for the video! ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:06:57.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
