In a letter, the departments also said that there \"must be due regard for the primary role of states and local school districts in establishing educational policy,\" essentially making the protection of transgender students a state issue instead of a federal one. \nBut considering that 150,000 people ages 13 to 17 identify as transgender in this country (according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law ), shouldn't it be a federal issue? Equal rights need to be preserved for our nation as a whole. There is no room for interpretation. There is no excuse for deviation. Equal rights for all. Period. \nEven Education Secretary Betsy DeVos reportedly initially opposed this new guidance (though it was backed, predictably, by Attorney General Jeff Sessions). House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi echoed the thoughts of many of her peers when she said in a statement : \"No student should face discrimination at school because of who they are. Transgender students have the same right to a safe environment at school and in their community as everyone else.\" \nMore from CafeMom: Fewer Kids Are Attempting Suicide -- Thanks to Some Basic Love & Acceptance \nUnfortunately, thanks to this enormous step backwards, many students likely won't have that right. Several states, including Texas, opposed Obama's initial directive in court. It's obvious which path they're going to choose now that the power is in their hands. What kind of nightmare awaits transgender students in those states? \nOne such student is Gavin Grimm, a transgender teen from Virginia who was banned from using the boys' bathroom at his school. A Supreme Court case over the ban is pending, but because of this policy change, the justices could now turn the case down and hand it over to lower courts. Again, an enormous step in the wrong direction. \nMore from CafeMom: Transgender Teens Talk to Their Future Selves & It'll Bring You to Tears \nIt's difficult to understand why anyone would oppose measures that seek to do nothing but protect children from harm. The only conceivable motivations stem from a place of intolerance, ignorance, and hatred -- but then, intolerance, ignorance, and hatred are fast becoming the hallmarks of this administration. Still, even if this ugly rollback isn't entirely unexpected, that doesn't make it any less shocking or unacceptable. It's just one more battle that we'll have to fight ... yet again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:48:08.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
