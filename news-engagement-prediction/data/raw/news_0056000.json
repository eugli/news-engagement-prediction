Tom Gralish \nAnd it's still cash-only. The policy is something of a motto, plastered on at least seven signs around the bar. (“I had up to 22 ‘cash only’ signs at one point, and still people tried to give me credit cards!” \nThe rule helps keep drinks cheap and service fast. But it’s also one way Sweitzer tries to keep a pledge she made when she bought the place. “I was given a charge by the previous owner,\" she said, \"to keep Frank’s Frank's. \nDirty Frank’s 347 S. 13 th St., Philadelphia, 215-732-5010, \nWhen to go: It’s open daily, 11 a.m.-2 a.m. I prefer it on a weeknight, when it’ \nBring: Potential friends and romantic partners.
