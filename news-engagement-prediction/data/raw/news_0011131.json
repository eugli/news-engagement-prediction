Mr Shiner was finally struck off last week after a string of misconduct charges against him, including five of dishonesty, were found proven following a Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal hearing. There have been calls for the lawyer to face criminal prosecution and the National Crime Agency is said to be reviewing evidence from the Legal Aid Authority. Among its findings, the parliamentary report is expected to question why PIL was paid by Ihat to help it with its inquiries. It will also criticise the MoD for paying the firm more than Â£200,000 after Mr Shiner had been reported to the Solicitors Regulation Authority, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Lawyer Phil Shiner was struck off last week Mr Mercer, a former Army captain, told the newspaper: 'I have made my distaste for the methods and behaviour of Ihat - and the MoD's complicity in it - very obvious over the last year. 'The evidence has been clear and I look forward to publishing our report a week Wednesday. 'I am pretty clear where the problems lie. 'There is a rotten core of civil servants in the MoD who have made decisions without ministers or military input, and have in the process demonstrated a disturbing lack of understanding or respect for the more subtle qualities that bind an army together and make men fight for each other or a cause. 'Things have improved this year but, prior to my investigation, there was no heed whatsoever paid to how this process has affected our people. That is a deep regret of mine.' The report is expected to call for Ihat, which is made up of mostly civilian investigators, to be replaced by a team from the military police. An MoD spokeswoman said: 'The Government is legally obliged to investigate criminal allegations and the courts are clear that if Ihat did not exist, British troops could be dragged through international courts. 'We're committed to reducing Ihat's caseload to a small number of credible cases as quickly as possible. 'We are determined to stop spurious legal claims against our troops and tackle the likes of Phil Shiner, who have abused our legal system. 'The Defence Secretary insisted that the MoD submit evidence on Shiner's actions due to the distress he caused to soldiers. That led to Shiner being struck off. Now we are taking steps to ensure this abuse cannot happen in the future.' Tory backbencher Johnny Mercer, who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into Ihat, said he believed a 'rotten core' of civil servants had warped the purpose of the process Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T17:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T12:26:14.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
