Their daughter Marissa, 15, was sitting in a booth in the cafeteria when the other girl grabbed her by the hair and began punching her. Another girl filmed the “assault” on her phone and posted it online, Ms. Salerno said. Her daughter was taken to the emergency room in an ambulance. \n“She’s missing pieces because she believes at one point she blacked out a little bit,” Ms. Salerno said about her daughter, who had to have a CT scan after the incident and still has faint bruising near her eye. \nThe teen is now afraid to come to school, her mother said. \n“I can’t imagine the phone call when you got it,” board member Vicky Roessler said during the meeting. “It breaks my heart. To hear a child say she feels unsafe in our school, I have a problem with it.” \nSuperintendent Timothy Glasspool said the student who initiated the fight and the student who recorded it both received the appropriate disciplinary action per school district policy. He couldn’t disclose what action was taken, or whether the girl was attending school. \nElizabeth Behrman: or 412-263-1590.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:10:02.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
