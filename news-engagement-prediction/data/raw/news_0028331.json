The mum-of-two took to Facebook to explain that though her sons don’t see their dad, she was determined her little boy wouldn’t be excluded from the ‘Dads and Doughnuts’ day at his school. So, she did what she had to do and donned her best ‘dad outfit.’ Sharing an image of herself dressed as a man and taking her son to the event, Whitney explained that when she became a single mum three years ago she vowed she would do all she could to ensure her sons had a ‘normal life.’ “We have accomplished a lot,” she wrote in a post on Facebook last week. “Trips alone, teaching my son how to play catch, killing bugs with minimal screaming and countless memories. But when my [son] came home with a paper saying that they were having ‘dads and doughnuts’ my heart kinda sank.” The mum went on to say that she had explained the situation to her little one and asked whether he’d like to go with his grandad, but he’d refused. “No. I want you to go,” he’d replied. “You’re my mum and dad”. “So this morning I gathered up my best dad outfit, painted on some facial hair, and went to breakfast with my sweet son,” Whitney continued. “I was so embarrassed but I couldn’t help but smile when he introduced me to his little friends saying: ‘This is my mum… she’s my dad too, so I brought her.” “When I went to leave, he ran after me and hugged me tight around my neck and whispered: ‘Mum I know that you’ll always be there and do anything for me.’” “I hope he remembers this day cause I’ll never forget it or his sweet words,” she finished her touching post. Since sharing the image and its accompanying message has been liked more than 208K times and received thousands of comments, many from other single parents who praised Whitney’s dedication to her sons. “What a wonderful mum (and dad) you are. Believe me, your son will remember. Mine did and, during his life, always wished me a happy Father’s Day as well as a happy Mother’s day. Keep it up,” wrote one parent. “You are an inspiration Whitney, every child should have a mum/dad like you!” added another.
