Daily Edition Meryl Streep Defends Golden Globes 'Football' Line, Rips Trump and Praises Trans Teacher in Emotional Speech 6:33 PM PST 2/11/2017 by Seth Abramovitch , Patrick Shanley COMMENTS Seth Abramovitch/Staff \"The whip of the Executive, through a Twitter feed, can lash and intimidate, punish and humiliate, delegitimize the press and imagined enemies with spasmodic regularity and easily provoked predictability,\" said Streep. \nSpeaking at the Human Rights Campaign’s 2017 Greater New York Gala Dinner on Saturday, Meryl Streep addressed her now-famous Golden Globes lifetime achievement award acceptance speech, in which she called out president Donald Trump and took shots at football and MMA as \"not the arts,\" while also criticizing Trump again and remembering her transgender middle school music teacher. \n\"First of all, I do like football. Let me just make that clear,\" Streep told the audience. \"I gave 7 years, 7 of my youngest, prettiest years to being a cheerleader for football, basketball, and wrestling.\" Streep also acknowledged that she was watching the Super Bowl this past Sunday. \"I have watched more Pee Wee league football, Pop Warner football, JV and Varsity high school football, JV and Varsity college level and professional football for over 60 years, more than probably anyone in this room; and yes, I thought the Falcons/Patriots game was the most exciting football game in history, but in my honest opinion it is totally crazy that the winning advantage in a Super Bowl tie is determined by means of a coin toss! Sad.\" \nStreep was honored at the event for her acting career and also her support of the LGBT community over the years. The actress addressed some of her previous roles in films that addressed LGBT issues. \"In The Hours all I did was kiss Allison Janney, take, after take, after take, after take…that wasn’t hard… I am fairly proud of my jolly portrayal of a gay conversion therapist on Lisa Kudrow’s show Web Therapy - I feel our Vice President might want to check out those episodes, as my character’s views seem to be in line with his own,\" Streep quipped. \n\"I am grateful to this incredible organization for what you’ve done, in such a smart, systematic, and strategic way, to secure and safeguard the fundamental rights of LGBTQ Americans. Much of the credit for the advances in acceptance, advocacy, and law comes in a straight line from your efforts,\" Streep said of the organization. \"When I was a young girl growing up in middle class New Jersey, my entire artistic life was curated by people who lived in the straightjacket of conformist suburban life. The goal was to put pennies in your loafers, to look alike, and act alike. Standing out, being different, was like drawing a target on your forehead. You had to have a special kind of courage to do it. Some of my teachers were obliged to live their whole lives hidden, covertly. But my sixth and seventh grade music teacher, Paul Grossman, was one of the bravest people I knew.\" \nStreep then honored the memory of Grossman by singing a song she had sung about her teacher at age 11. \n\"Look, here’s the deal,\" Streep continued. \"Human life has been organized in a certain way, the hierarchies set, who’s in charge, who makes the laws, and who enforces them, pretty much the same way for, oh, about 40,000 years. Yes, I know, there were a small number of matrilinear cultures, some outliers who were more tolerant of difference, some so–called democracies 2,000 years ago (who excluded women and slaves, of course); but pretty much, throughout history, might made right, the biggest, and richest, and baddest was the best, and The Man was pretty much always a man. But suddenly, at one point in the 20th century, for reasons I can’t possibly enumerate in my two remaining minutes, the clouds parted. Something changed. For the first time in 39,999 years, women began to be regarded as, if not equal, at least deserving of equal rights. Men and women of color demanded their equal rights. People of sexual orientation and gender identification outside the status quo also demanded equal regard under the law.\" \nStreep also took aim at president Trump yet again in her speech. \"Which brings us to now. We should not be surprised that fundamentalists, of every stripe, are exercised, and fuming. We should not be surprised that these profound changes come at a steeper cost than we originally though. If we live through this precarious moment- if his catastrophic instinct to retaliate doesn’t lead us to nuclear winter, we will have much to thank our current leader for. He will have woken us up to how fragile freedom is. The whip of the Executive, through a Twitter feed, can lash and intimidate, punish and humiliate, delegitimize the press and imagined enemies with spasmodic regularity and easily provoked predictability.\" \nThe lauded actress took some time to be self-referential, as well, addressing the president's recent labelling of her as \"over-rated\" following her Globes speech. \"Yes, I am the most overrated, over decorated and currently, over berated actress, who likes football, of my generation,\" the star admitted. \"But that is why you invited me here! Right?\" \nShe ended her speech with a rallying cry for those gathered. \"We have the right to live our lives, with God or without, as we choose. There is a prohibition against the establishment of a state religion in our Constitution, and we have the right to choose with whom we live, whom we love, and who and what gets to interfere with our bodies. As Americans, men, women, people, gay, straight, L, B, G, T, Q, all of us have the human right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. And if you think people got mad when they thought the government was coming after their guns: Wait’ll they come and try to take away our Happiness!\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:59:02.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
