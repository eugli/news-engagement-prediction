I know that this was illegal and the wrong thing to do. I understand that Foxtel and the event promoters invested hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce the fight and to broadcast it. I unreservedly apologise to Anthony Mundine and Danny Green, to the boxing community, to Foxtel, to the event promoters and to everyone out there who did the right thing and paid to view the fight. It was piracy, and I'm sorry. \nAnd on Thursday, Sharpe posted this to his Facebook page. \nLast Friday I streamed Foxtel's broadcast of Mundine v Green 2 fight via my Facebook page to thousands of people.

I unreservedly apologise to Anthony Mundine and Danny Green, to the boxing community, to Foxtel, to the event promoters and to everyone out there who did the right thing and paid to view the fight. It was wrong and I apologise. \nBoth men had set up GoFundMe pages to raise money for any potential fines, which lawyers estimated could be as much as $60,000. \nBut with that threat eased, the money has been passed on to charity.
