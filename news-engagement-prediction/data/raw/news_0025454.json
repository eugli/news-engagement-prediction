Chris confronts him with the tablet in hand: Supplied \nShortland Street's Chris Warner confronts his son Harry over some x-rated photos in the popular soap's latest cliffhanger. \n\"Please tell me that is not your penis!\" he rages. Then the credits roll. \nREAD MORE: * Shortland Street star Grace Palmer talks about the soap's upcoming return \nThe scene has been a sensation online, prompting a staggering amount of reaction on the show's Facebook : at time of writing there were 343,000 views, nearly 9000 likes, and 10,000 comments. \nShortland Street producer Maxine Fleming says she knew she had gold on her hands as soon as she read the script. \n\"As soon as I read that script I was like, that is the cliff [hanger] of the year, for me.\" \nShe said the idea for the plotline came when she was talking with the show's writers about doing a coming-of-age story about Harry Warner losing his virginity. \nThe show, which enters its 25th year this year, has done similar plotlines before, and the writers saw the dick-pic scenario as a way to put a contemporary spin on it. Ad Feedback \nFleming said the fact that the episode seemed to be resonating with both teens and their parents was a sign they had done their jobs. \n\"It is a comedy story, but like all good comedy there's a truth at the core of it, and it is social commentary, that story. Many teens are doing stuff like this, and many parents are worried about it.\" \"PLEASE TELL ME THAT IS NOT YOUR PENIS\" best ever Chris Warner moment ever! #shortlandstreet üçÜüçÜüçÜüçÜ ‚Äî Morgan Clare (@morgy85) February 10, 2017 I want Chris to say penis every episode üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ #shortlandstreet ‚Äî Rissa (@mccrae_c) February 10, 2017 \nFleming said that since taking over as producer on Shortland Street a year ago, she had been working to inject more humour into the show. \n\"We definitely have pushed things back to the comedy, we like funny, funny and real. ... Shortland Street to me is at its best when it doesn't take itself too seriously,\" she said. \nThe scene's classic ending line came from the brain of script producer Nick Malmholt, and Fleming suspected it might become a bit of a classic. \n\"I think Michael now is going to have that line shouted at him across the street. ... So I'm sorry about that Michael!\" she said. \nThe plotline will be developed further in subsequent episodes, Fleming said.
