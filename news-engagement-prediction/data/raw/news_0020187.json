The BJP chief also assured them that the party will take care of their concerns. \n\nHe also noted that the Modi government had made several Jat leaders, including Singh and Sanjeev Balyan , central ministers. \n\nBJP sources said Shah also asked the Jat leaders to think about whether voting for the RLD, the presence of which is only limited to parts of western Uttar Pradesh, will serve their interests. \n\nWith the agrarian community unlikely to back either the SP-Congress alliance or the BSP for a host of reasons, the BJP is hopeful that it can still walk away with a major chunk of Jat votes, the sources said. \n\nThe party was working overtime to win over the community and restrict the RLD's influence, they added. \n\nUttar Pradesh BJP general secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak said his party believed in 'sabka saath, sabka vikas' and it was imperative that it reached out to all the communities for their support in this regard. \n\nIn the aftermath of the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, which had pitted Jats against Muslims, the former had strongly favoured the BJP in the 2014 general election and even Ajit Singh, considered to be the most prominent Jat leader in the region, lost his pocket borough of Baghpat.
