Radi Nabulsi \nRising junior Trenton Thompson is withdrawing from classes this semester while he recovers from an adverse reaction to medications prescribed specifically for an undisclosed medical condition, UGA officials announced on Thursday. \nThompson was taken to the hospital on Wednesday night before being released on Thursday. \nGeorgia officials released the following statement on Thompson's condition: \n\"Based upon recent events, Trenton Thompson's family has authorized UGAAA to release the following information. Trenton has been dealing with a significant medical issue which required emergency hospitalization and extended hospital stay. Trenton was recently discharged from the hospital and remains under close medical care. With respect to last nightâ€™s incident, the physical appearance and behavior described in the UGA PD report is solely related to an adverse reaction to medications prescribed specifically for his medical condition. The adverse reaction required emergency transport to Piedmont Athens Regional Medical Center where he was treated and released. Toxicology tests performed at the hospital were negative for OxyContin. We cannot release any further information at this time due to federal privacy laws. Due to the medical issues, Trenton is withdrawing from classes this semester, and his family requests privacy during this time.\" \nAccording to the police report, Thompson was stopped at 1:14 a.m. off of East Carlton Street, where the officer noticed him wondering in the roadway just off River Road. \nThe report said that Thompson's eyes appeared glassy and his eyes appeared bloodshot. He told officers he had taken \"two oxies.\" Thompson was asked if he had been hit on the head recently, but could not answer, according to the report. \nHe was taken to Athens Regional Hospital at 1:40 a.m. \nThompson played in all 13 games for Georgia last year, making 56 tackles, including 9.5 for loss, five sacks and seven quarterback pressures. \nHe was named the MVP for the Bulldogs in their win over TCU in the Liberty Bowl.
