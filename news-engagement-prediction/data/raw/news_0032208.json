PUBLISHED: 22:01,  06,   A drone nearly collided with a plane above Potter's Bar \nThe airbus was flying at 6,000 feet when the near-miss occurred, according to a air safety report published yesterday. \nThe pilot of the A320 aircraft saw the white quadcopter drone \"flash past\" as he was flying above Potters Bar in Hertfordshire on August 15. \nHe quickly reported to air traffic control “something had just gone over the top”. Related articles \nAnother aircraft had just crossed above but the pilot said the object he had seen was red and white and around a metre in length. \nThe pilot had no time to respond, according to the report by UK Airprox Board. GETTY There have been several near-misses between planes and drones recently \nThe shocking incident came just months after another near-disaster in Britain’s skies. \nIn August a drone was flying in Cornwall when it almost collided with a Flybe passenger plane carrying 62 people on Tuesday. \nPolice said: “We view such incidents very seriously and the forces’ specialist drone unit will be leading on the investigating into this incident.” \nExperts have said a direct collision in the wrong part of the plane could lead to catastrophic engine failure or a cracked cockpit windscreen. GOOGLE MAPS The incident occurred in the sky above Potter's Bar in Hertfordshire \nFormer RAF and British Airways pilot Steve Landells has warned: “You end up with very high velocity bits of metal going anywhere they like. That could be through fuel tanks, through hydraulic lines and even into the cabin. \n\"Losing the engine is not going to cause an aircraft to crash because they are designed to fly with one engine down. \n\"But an uncontained engine failure is going to be different every time. That could be very serious indeed.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:13:07.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
