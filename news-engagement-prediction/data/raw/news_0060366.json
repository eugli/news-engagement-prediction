Priorities by the jubilee government are misplaced. We saw the President and his Deputy traverse the whole country to tell people to register as voters while forgetting about the immediate problems facing the citizens. I agree, voting is important but hey, is it that important to the extent that people can get sick, starve, be uneducated and vote for a new president?It is only in Kenya, the most developed country in East and Central Africa, that doctors have been on strike for almost three months, taps are dry, hunger is killing people and livestock and the lectures are on strike but the voter registration and the campaigns for the African Union Chair took precedence over any other considerationCorruption is thriving and social injustices are on the rise.As long as there is injustice in a society and nothing is done it will come back to haunt us. It happened in Europe and Kenya is not an exception. There is no society that can thrive under injustice, and you cannot say that you will unite people yet they are in pain and tears and no one is willing to wipe away those tears.People forget quickly or they just tend to act like they have selective amnesia. People’s lands were grabbed, they were displaced and sadly others lost their lives. It is unfortunate and sad that no one was charged with the crimes and you expect people to accept and move on. It does not work like that, and one day someone might remember all these injustices and make the whole country feel it. Our leaders and a good number of Kenyans turn a blind eye and hide under their tribal kingpins forgetting what happened in 2007/2008.During the last campaigning period, the then Jubilee coalition in their manifesto promised to make Kenya a double-digit economy, build five international stadiums, create five million jobs, construct a 9500-kilometer tarmac road, give out laptops to class one pupils and launch free maternity for women.During the teachers strike in 2015, the government turned a blind eye for two months and the teachers survived with their meager salary for two months after missing their September salary. It was paid after four four months and highly taxed. During that time our President was quoted saying that our teachers are best paid compared to teachers in Burundi. That was a very lame comparison. He was also quoted asking “Do you want me to donate my blood so that I can pay them?” Seriously for a head of state to say such a thing during a crisis it so sad.The government committed itself to a workable Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) in 2103 for the doctors. As we speak, Kenyans are dying in hospitals while the President and his Deputy are moving around looking for votes. Doctors go through school for six years only to be paid a gross salary of two hundred thousand shillings while a nominated Member of the County Assembly (MCA) goes home with three hundred thousand shillings every month. It is even more shameful when you jail doctors for fighting for their rights and the rights of their patients.Currently, the likes of Turkana are experiencing drought, we know that the Government cannot bring down rain, but they can cut on unnecessary expenditure to feed the starving Kenyans. The government discovered an aquifer in Turkana that can cater for the whole country for seventy years, and I think if they really cared they could have invested that money on drilling water and saving the Turkana people the fifty-kilometer walk in such of water.Companies are closing down and laying off workers because of tough economic times. The five million jobs you promised are yet to be seen and the youths are the ones suffering the most. The only thing the government is good at nowadays is blaming the opposition. I am not saying that I am supporting the opposition, but we all know that blame games have never brought any solutions. I hope and pray that when Kenyans go to the ballot on August 8th they will vote wisely.
