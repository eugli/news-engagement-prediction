(David Wexler/For New York Daily News) \nA few have enough funding to carry them for 20 years, according to the list compiled by Pension Rights Center using data collected from The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014. \nBut many of the funds in critical status have a life expectancy of 10 years or less — some as few as three years. \nThe Pension Rights Center urges working Americans to take steps to educate themselves about the looming pension crisis. \nThe prognosis is gloomy for upwards of 10 million Americans over the next few decades if several large funds collapse — particularly the Central States Pension fund that covers 407,000 Teamster truckers in the Midwest and South. \nTexas transgender bathroom law could hurt NYC's pension fund \nSeveral other Teamster pension funds are also poised to dissolve — and one of them, Local 707, officially went broke this month. \nThat has left 4,000 retirees on the edge of financial disaster — many having to make do on less than $1,000 a month when they were pulling down more than $3,000. \nFor retirees who want to know how much of a cut they might be forced to take, the Pension Rights Center has a calculator to do the math.
