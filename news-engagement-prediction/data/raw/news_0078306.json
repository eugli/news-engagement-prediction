Earl Wilson posted on Facebook after the product, which he bought at a B&M Stores branch in Doncaster, fell apart while the infant was using it. His post has racked up thousands of shares and comments with some concerned mothers saying their children have also choked on dummies. Mr Wilson wrote: 'Beware, my daughter nearly choked on this Tommee Tippee soother yesterday morning. 'If it wasn't for my wife's quick thinking I'd hate to think what would (have) happened. 'My daughter turned blue and Sam had to remove the teat from her throat. 'My main concern is it's an owl dummy so people will be using it at bed time. 'I don't think my daughter would be here now if this happened in the middle of the night. 'I've been to B&M on York Road and they say they're going to contact head office.' One worried mother replied: 'My daughter almost choked on one of these as well. Mr Wilson's Facebook post about the dummy has racked up thousands of comments and shares from concerned parents 'I heard a muffled noise and when I went into the room she had the whole dummy in her mouth and it was lodged, I believe the dummies are too small and something needs to be done by Tommy Tippee.' Tommee Tippee has vowed to launch a probe after contacting the parents and asking them to send the dummy in for investigation.
