The project's leaders announced it will add a new 500-foot free-fall dive attraction called Sky Jump to its portfolio of attractions that already includes the 501-foot Skyscraper polercoaster, the 450-foot Skyfall drop tower, a 600-foot Skyfly zip line, the Skysurf park, the SkyLedge thrill experience , and other features like a hotel and the SkyPlaza retail/dining area. 3 photos This rendering of Skyplex showcases the lighting tourists may expect each evening at the… more Orlando's Sky Jump will be the first East Coast installment of a similarly-named attraction at Las Vegas' Stratosphere that has guests free-falling on a controlled line. “I’ve jumped in Las Vegas several times, and that moment before you go is heart-stopping. Your knees are knocking. People absolutely will love it. I know I sure do,\" said David Wallack , who is developing Skyplex with his son, Joshua Wallack . The Wallacks also are known for bringing Mango's Tropical Cafe to Orlando and are in the middle of building the new Hollywood Plaza parking garage and entertainment space on I-Drive, which includes a Circo Orlando restaurant, multiple ground-floor retail, entertainment and a parking garage . Many eyes are on the construction of Skyplex, which is undergoing heavy site preparation and other infrastructure work. That work includes \"infrastructure improvements, zoning changes to make the vision and development more predictable, underground and modernized utilities and transportation improvements such as the four-way I-Drive/Sand Lake Road pedestrian bridge,\" said Joshua Wallack , in a prepared statement. The Skyplex complex is a much-anticipated project for the I-Drive corridor, bringing the 501-foot Skyscraper polercoaster, the 450-foot Skyfall drop tower, a 600-foot Skyfly zip line, the Skysurf park and a 450-room hotel, all built in and around the SkyPlaza retail, entertainment and dining center. The project is expected to open in 2019. It's sure to help Orlando's $60 billion tourism industry, which attracted a record 66 million visitors last year. This is not the last attraction the Skyplex project will welcome as Joshua Wallack said there are more deals in the works.
