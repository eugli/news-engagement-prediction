Unlike the nominations, which rely on a branch-specific, preferential-voting system, winners are chosen by popular vote. Two accountants are tasked with bringing the final results, inside sealed envelopes, to the Oscars ceremony. They are the people carrying briefcases on the red carpet, flanked by police protection. Each briefcase contains an identical set of envelopes for the show's 24 categories. The accountants also memorize the winners.

During the telecast, the two briefcase-toting accountants are stationed in the Dolby Theatre wings, one stage left and one stage right.

They come backstage a few minutes ahead of time, and the accountant hands them their category's envelope just before they walk onstage. The sealed envelope with the winner's name inside is opened live onstage. The second-to-last award, best actress, was presented by Leonardo DiCaprio, who entered stage left. PwC representative Martha Ruiz handed him the envelope for the correct category. Leonardo DiCaprio arrived from stage left to present best actress, the penultimate award of the night. (Kevin Winter/Getty Images) On Sunday, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway entered stage right, where PwC representative Brian Cullinan handed them the errant envelope. Faye Dunaway, left, prodded fellow presenter Warren Beatty as he paused quizzically after opening the envelope. (Kevin Winter/Getty Images) A duplicate, unopened envelope for best actress had remained stage right, and apparently ended up in the hands of Beatty and Dunaway.
