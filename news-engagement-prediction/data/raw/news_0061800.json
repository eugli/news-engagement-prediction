How many ping pong balls fit in a school bus? \nGlassdoor , the jobs- and career-focused site, compiled 27 of the toughest interview questions job seekers face in any field.

The number of screenings, company size, public or private status of employer and job seekers' education and age all affected how difficult interviews were.
