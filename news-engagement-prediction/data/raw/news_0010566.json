We were excited to know we would be bringing home some silverware. \n\"We were pretty thrilled. We didn't think it would necessarily happen at the first tournament.\" \nThe men's side fought well, but were unable to get the better of the Australian side, going down 2-1 in the series. \n\"Every set was close, like 11-8 or 11-9. It was just a case of a little more experience needed.\" Ad Feedback \nDowall said the tournament was a fantastic experience and it really hit everyone in the team when they lined up against the Green and Gold. \nHe said it also provided an opportunity to see how our national teams matched up against a country with a bit more experience in the sport. \n\"If we went over there and got smashed we'd know we have a lot more work to do. \n\"The way we competed, there's no reason we can't go on and work toward the World Championships in the next few years.\" \nDowall said since Stuff's first story on the sport in mid-January, he had received a lot of interest in people from around the country looking to get involved in the sport. \nHe said with such positive signs coming out of their first international matches, the plan now would be to keep things going and hopefully see the sport played outside of the Canterbury region - where the entire New Zealand team were based. \n\"I've been in touch with people in places like Auckland, Wellington and Taranaki asking about how they can get involved. \n\"The last thing we want to do is to have this experience then see the sport fade away. We want to see it continue to grow.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:40:47.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
