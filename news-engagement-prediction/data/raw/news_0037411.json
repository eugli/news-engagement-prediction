The reports began surfacing Saturday morning after video surfaced of police subduing a man hurling verbal assaults at Big Sean. The video featured a bystander commenting that Big Sean was slapped, and the rapper took to Twitter to clarify things.\nLook I never comment on this type of shit but they can&apos;t do me dirty and say a fan smacked me or no shit like that.\n‚Äî Sean Don (@BigSean) February 18, 2017 Related Big Sean Gives Biggest Fan Preview of \"Hall of Fame\" How Big Sean Reinvented His Brand With 'I Decided' Big Sean Talks Controversial Eminem Verse, Jhen√© Aiko, and Greatness on 'Breakfast Club' Big Sean earned his second No. 1 appearance on Billboard magazine‚Äôs Top 200 albums chart with I Decided, and celebrated with an obligatory album signing Friday night at an FYE in the Ridgewood section of Queens. In an era overrun with smartphone camera footage, the only clip to surface of the autograph session seems to be of a man being tackled by several police officers as he hurls obscenities at the G.O.O.D. Music rapper. Multiple sources report the man stood in line alongside fans Friday before he later attempted to slap Big Sean in the face. There‚Äôs no proof if his attempts were successful or not, as the only video to be produced features the obscured man in handcuffs being subdued by the officers.\nBig Sean getting smacked by a fan at a meet and greet üòÇüòÇüòÇ pic.twitter.com/dvbsj6zF4j\n‚Äî „Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§ (@TrashCudi) February 18, 2017\n‚ÄúYou pussy, nigga,‚Äù the unknown man screamed at Sean while being cuffed. ‚ÄúTell Jay Z what‚Äôs up.‚Äù\nA fan behind the assaulter can be heard saying the attempt connected and Sean was indeed slapped.

The Detroit native sold the equivalent of 151,000 album units to earn the top-selling album in the country with his fourth retail album as a soloist. Sean has yet to speak on the confrontation.\nTags: News , Big Sean , Fans , Queens , Twitter", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZFT38N15gaw", "https://twitter.com/BigSean/status/833000822971756544", "https://twitter.com/TrashCudi/status/832795806348382210", "https://t.co/dvbsj6zF4j"], "published": "2017-02-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T19:32:24.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
