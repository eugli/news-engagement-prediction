She moved from Virginia to New Jersey where she studied to be a physical therapist at the Panzar College of Physical Education and at Union Junior College and then furthered her training as a physical therapist in Chicago. \nIn 1951, Bessie Blount started teaching Physical Therapy at the Bronx Hospital in New York.
