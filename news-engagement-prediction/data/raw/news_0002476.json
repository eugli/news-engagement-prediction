There is no leakage from the ship,” Radhakrishnan said. \nShipping secretary Rajive Kumar said that like with the provisions of enquiry by DGCA, in case of accidents involving air planes, there is a similar provision in the Merchant Shipping Act for enquiry and fixing responsibility. \nHe said final findings were expected in a month as all possible evidences are being collected to fix the liability. Emergency workers and locals stand along the shoreline of Ennore port during the clean-up operation in Chennai. (Reuters) \nAlso, he said, the shipping ministry has sought an audit report on whether the ports handling oil are well equipped as “50% subsidy is given to ports handling oil to get equipment and last year we got OISD (Oil Industry Safety Board) which looks after the safety of oil installations in the country. \n“Whatever deficiencies they had pointed out, instructions were given to remove them and I had been told by Ennore port they had the equipment which is prescribed under the crisis management plan”. \nHe said pollution control measures have already been initiated as per the crisis management plan and the government has deputed a high level committee to oversee operations comprising joint secretary shipping, additional secretary shipping as well as additional secretary from petroleum. \n“We were coordinating the efforts with Coast Guard as well as with the state governments... There was absolute coordination. People were working which were provided by both the ports as well as from the maritime institutions. The NGOs and other volunteers, they have done outstandingly good work,” Kumar said. \nHe explained that one tonne of oil leaked gets ten times bigger after being mixed with water and debris and by Friday morning, 116 tonnes of sludge had been collected.
