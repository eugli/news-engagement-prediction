Michael had no arrest history.\n'It's just a red-hot mess,' Polk County Sheriff Gracy Judd said. 'We got a man who was drunk. A girlfriend he's lived with for five years. We got a kid in the middle of this manure pile, and we're trying to sort it out.'", "external_links": ["http://www.theledger.com/news/20170215/15-year-old-charged-with-murder-in-fatal-mulberry-shooting"], "published": "2017-02-16T16:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T17:40:33.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
