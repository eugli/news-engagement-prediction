He said the victims were seized and taken to a quarry, where they were gunned down. Photo Edgar Matobato at a safe house in Manila in September. Mr. Matobato has been in hiding since last year, when he linked the president to extrajudicial killings. Credit Jes Aznar for The New York Times He did not say how the bodies were disposed of, but last year Mr. Matobato testified that victims were chopped up and then their parts taken to sea to be scattered. It was not immediately clear what Mr. Lascañas would do next, but he has been under the protection of the Free Legal Assistance Group , an organization of rights advocates and lawyers who have criticized Mr. Duterte’s deadly campaign against drugs. The group said that Mr. Lascañas had drawn up a sworn affidavit and was ready to testify before any government body, including the Senate. Mr. Lascañas’s statements on Monday were in line with Mr. Matobato’s testimony last year. At the time, he said he was one of the first civilians Mr. Lascañas had recruited into the death squad, originally known as the Lambada Boys, that was responsible for kidnappings, killings and the bombing of a mosque in Davao. He said the squad answered to Mr. Duterte and his longtime lieutenant, Ronald dela Rosa, now director general of the Philippine National Police. Mr. Andanar, the president’s spokesman, said in his statement on Monday: “Our people are aware that this character assassination is nothing but vicious politics orchestrated by sectors affected by the reforms initiated by the Duterte administration.” “Bringing change is not an easy task,” he added. “The Duterte administration has disturbed, disrupted the establishment. However, we remain undistracted in delivering goods and services to serve the people, not just the interest of the few.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Senator Antonio Trillanes, who has been feuding with Mr. Duterte and who supported Mr. Matobato when he made his accusations last year, said that Mr. Andanar’s statement was intended to divert attention away from “ the issue of the president’s complicity” in multiple murders. Senator Risa Hontiveros called Mr. Lascañas’s allegations a “direct stab at the credibility” of the president that undermined his “moral capacity to lead.” “They strengthen suspicions that the death squads responsible for thousands of unsolved extrajudicial killings are state-sanctioned,” Ms. Hontiveros said. She called on the Senate to investigate Mr. Lascañas’s accusations and respond to what she called the “public’s clamor for truth and accountability.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:28:29.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
