By David Grossman Feb 3, 2017 Financial experts and environmental scientists have released a report predicting that global demand for oil and coal energy will peak by 2020. Afterwards, the lowering costs of renewable energy will undercut the demand for fossil fuels across the planet. Co-written by Carbon Tracker, an independent financial think tank, and the Grantham Institue at the Imperial College of London, the study shows that solar energy \"could supply 23 percent of global power generation in 2040 and 29 percent by 2050, entirely phasing out coal and leaving natural gas with just a 1 percent market share.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The price of solar photovolatics have fallen 85 percent in the last seven years, giving it a leg up in becoming the dominant alternative fuel source globally. The rise in electric vehicles, 60 percent year-on-year, speaks to that price reduction. Battery costs have fallen by 73 percent in those same seven years, and by 2030 one in every five cars on the road might be powered by electricity. With growth in hybrids, cars that solely run on fossil fuels could make up for less than half the cars on the road by 2030. By 2050, the study speculates, they would make up only a third. Most Popular \"Electric vehicles and solar power are game-changers that the fossil fuel industry consistently underestimates. Further innovation could make our scenarios look conservative in 5 years' time, in which case the demand misread by companies will have been amplified even more,\" said Luke Sussams, a senior researcher at Carbon Tracker in a press report. While there are still a few places in the United States where coal is the cheapest energy option , these are rapidly dwindling. Increasingly, coal plants are turning to digitization to make themselves more efficient. New coal plants are being built in China and Japan , but there \"is no more business as usual in the energy sector,\" said James Leaton, head of research at Carbon Tracker. \"There are a number of low-carbon technologies about to achieve critical mass decades before some companies expect.\" The study has put out an interactive tool , with a variety of climate change predictions and energy demand hypotheticals, allowing readers to create their own energy demand futures. None of them look particularly promising for coal or oil.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:31:12.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
