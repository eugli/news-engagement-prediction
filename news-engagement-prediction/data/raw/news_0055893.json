The drama will be back for a 22-episode second season. \n“ Lethal Weapon continues to fire on all cylinders,” said network entertainment president David Madden. “Every week, it delivers a big, fun rollercoaster ride, but also remains touchingly human and genuinely emotional, and that’s due to the chemistry that’s developed not only between Damon Wayans and Clayne Crawford, but the entire cast. We want to thank our producing partners, Warner Bros., as well as Matt Miller, McG, Dan Lin and Jennifer Gwartz, who have done a fantastic job in crafting a series for which a second-season order is well deserved.” Loosely inspired by the film franchise starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, the Lethal Weapon series again follows Riggs (Crawford), coming back to work after the loss of his wife and unborn child, and Murtaugh (Wayans), recovering from a heart attack, as they partner up to work the beat in modern-day Los Angeles. Fox's first freshman series of the 2016-17 season to earn a full-season order, Lethal Weapon debuted as Fox's highest-rated fall premiere in two years. The series has remained a solid performer this season, most recently pulling a 1.4 rating among adults 18-49. The series, which averages 11 million viewers across multiple platforms, currently ranks among the top five first-year shows on the Big Four. In addition to The Mick, Lethal Weapon also joins renewed Fox series Empire, The Simpsons and Lucifer , the latter which also hails from Warner Bros. TV. The studio is also behind Batman drama Gotham , which is currently in its third season on Fox.
