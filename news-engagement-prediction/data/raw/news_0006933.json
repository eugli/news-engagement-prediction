He first looked around and then picked Coco by the collar. In the footage he is seen dragging Coco and then putting her inside the car before driving away. Everything happened in less than 40 seconds,” said Sethi who works as a business development manager with a startup. \nSethi said that by the time her sister Jigyasa came out looking for Coco, the dog had gone missing. They looked for her in the locality. But when she could not be located, they scanned the CCTV footage and saw the man driving away with Coco. \n“We called the police on 100 and filed a complaint. However, no FIR was lodged. It was only when I approached somebody in a ministry and sought help, the FIR was filed on December 29, a week after the crime,” she said. \nThe investigating officer from the Karol Bagh police station collected the CCTV footage but later told the complainant that they were unable to identify the suspect or his car’s registration number as the video footage was of poor quality. The police sought help from local taxi drivers and shopkeepers but failed to trace Coco. \nMandeep Singh Randhawa, DCP (central), said, “A team has already been formed to trace the missing dog. We will take help of cameras installed on the route that was taken by the thief. Their footage may give us some clues.” \nThe police suspect that the person who kidnapped Coco was a member of a gang of professional cattle thieves that steal pet animals, mostly dogs, and sell them illegally for large profits. “Coco being a female dog, may be used for breeding purposes and her Beagle puppies may then be sold in the illegal market, for a cost starting from Rs15,000. Tracing a missing dog and nabbing such thieves is a difficult task because we have not come across any organised gangs in the past. Also, such cases are not reported frequently,” said a senior police officer. \nTracking Delhi’s missing dogs \nNovember 2016: A male Indian dog Johnny went missing from north Delhi’s Wazirpur. His owner Gautam said they are yet to trace Johnny. \nJune 2016: A Siberian Husky was kidnapped by a gang of cattle thieves when it tried to prevent them from stealing pigs in south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj Enclave. A week later, the dog was found tied to an electric pole in the same area. His kidnappers haven’t been caught. \nMarch 2015: 4-year-old Labrador Bosco was stolen by unknown people from Indraprastha Park near Sarai Kale Khan in south Delhi where his owner, a banker, had taken him for a walk. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:37:32.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
