(Supplied: Dannii Best) \n\"We just felt that it was important to start telling real stories of motherhood, stories of women who have overcome a variety of challenging circumstances,\" Ms Parker said. \nThe Babes Project supplies a care package to women involved in the program and the ultimate aim is for the Rewriting Motherhood book to be included within this pack. \nBeyond that, Ms Parker said she hoped the book would go to schools, hospitals and doctors' waiting rooms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:38:05.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
