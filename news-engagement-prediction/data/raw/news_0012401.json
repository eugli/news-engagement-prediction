Is that the fault of the non-Muslims? \nIn fact, PAS would have done worse without the support of Chinese and Indian voters. Truth be told, even among Muslim voters they do not trust PAS and its brand of politics. \nOtherwise, why did the rural and semi-urban Muslim voters reject PAS overwhelmingly in favour of Umno? \nWhat Hadi is saying is that DAP and PKR must sacrifice their mixed urban seats to PAS because PAS cannot win with Muslim votes alone. Why should the other parties make this sacrifice? \nIiiizzzziiii: PAS has only 25 seats because it had lost many seats which it had contested. The 89 seats in the opposition camp are the actual seats won, and not the number of seats PAS contested. \nIn the seats negotiation for the last general election, PAS had demanded for seats but failed to deliver. Now Hadi is using the discrepancy in the seats to justify his claim. If only PAS can translate contested seats into actual seats in Parliament. \nDo not blame others for PAS’ failure to win more seats. Hadi’s argument shows his stupidity as well that of those who agree or follow him. \nIt’s hard to believe he is so revered among his kind, but then fanatics and zealots have shown to be dim-witted throughout history. \nClever Voter: PAS agenda is simple. Win power to impose Islamic rule. Their mission is clear and their priority is to make sure their interpretation of Islamic rules is applied to all aspects of economy and society. \nIf only they can replace parliamentary democracy with their version of one-party state. PAS doesn't believe in diversity and political inclusion. It's their way or no other way. If they lose, it’s fine; they will capitalise on the downfall of BN. \nIt's now up to voters. Given the increasing number of Muslim voters in the years to come, PAS can afford to wait. They could possibly hope for the collapse of secular politics. \nIt’s an irony the more they court PAS, the more mileage these bigots will end up with. That's a double-edged sword for all. \nFairman: I agree with Hadi that a Malay Muslim should lead the federal cabinet. But the role of Sabahans and Sarawakians are equally important. \nIf you want 40 seats, you must also win the support of non-Muslims. Forget about DAP whom you have been fighting with. What is your pledge for the non-Muslim voters? \nYou want to enhance syariah punishment or ensure accountability, transparency, integrity, and efficiency? What about the 1MDB, RM2.6 billion and MO1 (Malaysian Official 1) issues? \nMushiro: What is the use of ensuring Muslim clout in Malaysian politics if most of these Muslim leaders that PAS endorses are very corrupted, kleptomaniacs, murderers, thieves and cheats? \nAnonymous #33457332: Yes, when will Hadi and politicians who think like him realise that good governance is not based on religion and race? \nThis country ought to be governed by people who do not think about their racial origin or religious beliefs in all decision makings. Only then, the question of imbalance in representation would not arise. \nSusahKes: With all the gaps existing in the audit trail of the monies, I would have thought you would have agreed with the rest of us that MO1 runs a kleptocrat's ring. \nAnd that you would have been indignant like the rest of us, and would have exhibited a level of righteous anger that would have made us proud. \nBut no, instead you proceeded to have a photo-op moment with your new BFF (best friend forever) from Umno, adorned in pink garb no less. \nSo Hadi, excuse me if I'm not totally impressed with your new-found number-crunching ability. \nPersonally, I would have settled if you had learned how to take boat-rowing lessons, seeing how your Kelantan MB got stuck inside in his own house for underestimating the flood situation in his own state. \nMA: It's a pity to see how the poor and vulnerable Malays been brainwashed by these power-greedy religious bigots and politicians amassing wealth and leaving them in utter abject poverty. \nYou feel the shame to see some of these wealthy Malays splurging away like there is no tomorrow, while the poor remain trap in the spiral of hopelessness because of people like Hadi who twist religion to suit their intentions and purpose. \nAnonymous 2411361459930771: What is wrong if a good and God-fearing non-Muslim who is fair and honest leads Malaysia rather than a Muslim leader who steals from the national coffers and only enriches himself and his family. \nI, a non-Muslim, do not mind if a good, fair and honest Muslim rule rather than a corrupt Christian, a corrupt Buddhist or a corrupt Hindu. \nI will give my vote 100 percent to that Muslim. Hadi, this is where your sincerity and faith are being put to the test. \nAnonymous_1371726498: PAS can’t even hold on and manage Terengganu and Kedah well. See how DAP and PKR manage and run Penang and Selangor since 2008. \nAnonymous #40538199: Please do not use religion to mislead the rakyat. Regardless of whatever religion the kleptocrats claim to follow, kleptocracy will destroy the country. \nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers.
