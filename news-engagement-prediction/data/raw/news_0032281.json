While assisting on the track during Carey's race at the Pro 250 class finals in Mammoth, CA, the singer stepped out in front as Carey entered his third lap holding up a pit board that read, \"Will You Marry Me?\" When Carey failed to pull over, she added \"Serious!\" to it. As you can imagine, Carey finally hopped off of his bike and said \"yes.\" The couple got married six months later in Costa Rica and have been making sweet (and sometimes salty ) music together ever since.
