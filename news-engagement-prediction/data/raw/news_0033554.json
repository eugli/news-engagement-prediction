But what does the notion that a person has a destiny – a fixed future – tell us about how free that person’s actions really are, and how morally responsible for those actions they can legitimately be held to be? This day event will examine this and associated questions concerning the relationship between there being a fixed future, free will, and moral praise or blame, all against the backdrop of George Lucas’ epic tale of the triumph of good over evil in a galaxy far, far away.” View photos Do the Jedi really have free will? – Credit: Lucasfilm More Star Wars and Philosophy: Destiny, Justice and the Metaphysics of the Force will be held on a date long-held sacred by ‘Star Wars’ fans. Yes, really – May the Fourth. While it may be a bit of a publicity stunt on behalf of the University of Glasgow, it’s all part of a drive to make philosophy more accessible – introducing lofty ideas about free will and moral responsibility in the context of the popular sci-fi film franchise. “It’s an unfortunate fact that philosophy tends to be hidden away in universities,” Dr John Donaldson told the BBC . “You don’t get programmes about philosophy on TV for example, which you do about other academic subjects. You don’t tend to get books that deal with philosophical ideas. It’s not that accessible. We hope it will engage people and encourage them to take philosophy further.” According to Dr Donaldson, the university has already run courses exploring philosophical questions raised by ‘The Sopranos’, ‘The Wire’ and even ‘The Simpsons’. Let’s just hope they don’t delve into the Sith too much. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:45:50.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
