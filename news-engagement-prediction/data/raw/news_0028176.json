Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's security clearance should be revoked in response to reports that he discussed with Russia lifting sanctions put in place by then-President Barack Obama. \n\"Yes, think that's an appropriate action,\" Cumming said Sunday during an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. \"But, George, there's something else that needs to be asked. That is: Did the president instruct General Flynn to talk to the ambassador? And did he know about it? If he knew about this conversation, when did he know it? That, to me, that is the key question. And we need to find out what that answer is.\" Story Continued Below \nCummings' comments came as Democrats increase pressure for a broad investigation of Flynn over reports from The Washington Post and The New York Times that Flynn potentially lied to colleagues about his previous dealings with Russia. Those reports suggested that Flynn potentially discussed lifting sanctions on Russia before President Donald Trump's inauguration, when Obama was still president. The sanctions were put in place in response to Russian meddling in the last presidential election according to a conclusion from U.S. intelligence agencies.
