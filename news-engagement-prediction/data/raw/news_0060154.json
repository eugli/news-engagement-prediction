I've known about it forever and it's part of me but I don't dwell on it.\n\"I get on really well with my adoptive parents and I'm proud that I have this life now,\" she says.\nWriting in The Lancet, researchers from King's College London, the University of Southampton and from Germany, want to find out more about what makes people like Adi able to cope after such a deprived start in life by scanning their whole genomes.\nHowever, most of the Romanian children brought to the UK between 1990 and 1992 have not fared so well.\nAdi was adopted along with another girl who became her sister - she also has two brothers Initially, all 165 were struggling with developmental delays and malnourishment.\nWhile many of those who spent less than six months in an institution showed remarkable signs of recovery by the age of five or six, children who had spent longer periods in orphanages had far higher rates of social, emotional and cognitive problems during their lives.\nCommon issues included difficulty engaging with other people, forming relationships and problems with concentration and attention levels which continued into adulthood.\nThis group was also three to four times more likely to experience emotional problems as adults, with more than 40% having contact with mental health services.\nDespite their low IQs returning to normal levels over time, they had higher rates of unemployment than other adopted children from the UK and Romania.\nThe research team said this was the first large-scale study to show that deprivation and neglect during early childhood could have a profound effect on mental health and wellbeing in later life.\n'Loving family' Prof Edmund Sonuga-Barke, study author from King's College London, said it was possible that \"something quite fundamental may have happened in the brains of those children, despite the families and schools they went to\".\nAnd he said getting children out of those neglected situations as soon as possible \"and into a loving family\" was crucial.\nProf Sonuga-Barke said: \"This highlights the importance of assessing patients from deprived backgrounds when providing mental health support and carefully planning care when these patients transfer from child to adult mental health care.\"\nCommenting on the research, Prof Frank Verhulst, from Erasmus University Medical Centre in the Netherlands, said many young children could be similarly affected.\n\"This finding is true for millions of children around the world who are exposed to war, terrorism, violence, or mass migration.\n\"As a consequence, many young children face trauma, displacement, homelessness, or family disruption.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/13E70/production/_94802518_adi_calvert_dad.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/F050/production/_94802516_adi_calvert_cot.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/57F8/production/_94802522_adi_orphanage.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-23T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:34:59.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
