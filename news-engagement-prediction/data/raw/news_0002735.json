Beyonce revealed she is pregnant with twins in an Instagram post Read More Every moment of childbirth captured in raw and emotional photographs \nAs well as agreeing that the Perfect Prep is 'a must buy' for bottle feeders, they had plenty of advice to offer. \nKate Shaw, from Prestwich, is mum to 10-month-old boys Liam and Finn and admits it's a tough time for parents. \nShe said: \"Try and have support around and it is what it is, double everything, from crying to nappies to sleepless nights. So keep your sense of humour at the ready at all times.\" Kate Shaw with twins Liam and Finn Read More What's the most popular baby name in your area? \nShe says one of the biggest things is coping with the 'onslaught of stranger comments', so much so that she's been asking mums to share their entertaining replies to people such as 'I'm experimenting with cloning'. \nKate, 40, who also has a four-year-old daughter Niamh, added: \"It's mostly lovely people who will help out when you are out and about, but you sometimes have to grit your teeth for another 'double trouble', 'you've got your hands full', or 'are they twins'? \n\"Hence starting my entertaining replies challenge. Current suggestions are 'different dads', 'I only left the house with one' and 'Bogof offer so I went for it'.\" \nLouise Earnshaw, from Bury, has 14-month-old twins Seth and Darcy and agreed that parents have to get used to plenty of comments. \nThe 35-year-old said: \"I think my best tips would be to prepare for the shortest of shopping trips to actually be four times as long due to the amount of times you get asked 'are they twins'?, 'are they identical'? and 'do they run in the family?' Louise Earnshaw with Seth and Darcy Read More Parents putting babies at risk of SIDS with unsafe sleep habits \n\"Also, getting them on a feeding schedule together asap as otherwise sleep is zero. And trying not to slap anyone that says sleep when the baby sleeps - with two of them tag teaming it's not often a possibility.\" \nShe said the rules have to change with twins, adding: \"Overnight we would wake one once the other woke for a feed, with twins I'd agree that the saying 'never wake a sleeping baby' does not apply. Darcy and Seth WATCH: The parents going to extreme lengths to reveal their baby's gender \n\"I could never get them to keep still enough to feed at the same time if I was alone so I would do one directly after the other, and found it worked just as well. \n\"Also expensive feeding pillows are a waste of time, an armful of normal cushions and pillows works fine.\" \nDiane Coxhead was single for the first two-and-a-half years with her twins Kayleigh and Nikita. \nThe 39-year-old, who also has one-year-old son Joseph-James, who they call JJ, said: \"My advice would be if anyone offers a helping hand take it and rest when they sleep when newborn babies. \n\"I fed them both at the same time, one at either side in the baby bouncers. Kayleigh and Nikita 'Don't suffer in silence' is the message to mums on World Maternal Mental Health Day \n\"The biggest problems I've come up against is now when they're in school and they have different homework and they are wanting to do it with me both at the same time, not being able to get round small shops with the double prams and some shops didn't have twin trolleys.\" \nSheryl Allcock added: \"Mine are nearly 15 months old. My tips would be routine is good, but have some flexibility within in, if you bottle feed the Perfect Prep is a must buy. \n\"Don't compare yourself to others, and enjoy the ride.\" \nAre you a mum of twins or more?
