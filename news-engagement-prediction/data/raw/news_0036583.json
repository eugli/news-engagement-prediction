Haley Nelson/Post-Gazette Kiera Heyl, 7, left, and her friend march with other Girl Scout on Wednesday on the North Shore. Haley Nelson/Post-Gazette Girl scouts shout and cheer as a car honks at them outside the Girl Scouts of Western Pennsylvania executive offices on Wednesday. Haley Nelson/Post-Gazette Girl Scouts and their troop leaders are asking executives to reverse board members' closed-door decision to sell off Camps Singing Hills, Curry Creek, Resting Waters, Elliott and Roy Weller. Anya Sostek   \nA group of local Girl Scouts wants to preserve their access to the outdoors. And they were willing to march for more than an hour in freezing temperatures, wind and snow flurries to deliver that message to Girl Scout leadership. \nCarrying signs such as “Save our Camps, Save My Childhood” and chanting slogans like “Give Us a Voice, Give Us a Choice,” about 30 Girl Scouts and adults protested outside Girl Scouts of Western Pennsylvania headquarters on the North Side, registering their opposition to the group’s decision to close more than half of its camps. \nGirl Scouts of Western Pennsylvania announced Jan. 23 that it would be closing five of its nine camps on March 31, saying that the camps are underutilized and a drain on the council’s financial resources. \nThe protest got the attention of Patricia Burkhart, chief executive officer of the GSWPA, who came outside to invite several of the girls and troop leaders to meet with her privately. “A peaceful protest is just great,” she said. “We want to hear what the girls have to say and they’re doing a nice job.” \nCambrea Earley, an 18-year-old senior at Peters Township High School, worked for two years to be certified as a Girl Scout ranger at Camp Roy Weller, which has been slated for closure, learning to lead younger girls on hikes through the camp’s “For Girls, By Girls” program. Closing so many camps “is going to ruin what Girl Scouts is,” she said at the protest. “Girl Scouts is more than just selling cookies.” \nAnya Sostek: asostek@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1308.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:49:25.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
