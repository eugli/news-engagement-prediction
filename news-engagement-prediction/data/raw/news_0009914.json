Now it has announced the availability of the most basic model of the seven different ones launched -- the ROG Strix GL553 -- in India.

The two models showcased at CES -- the GL553 and the GL573 -- were based on the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX1050TI Graphics, but both were said to be running the 7th Gen Core i7 chipset. \nBut the GL553 launched in India comes in two models -- the ROG GL553VD and the ROG GL553VE, the former with an Intel 2.8GHz Core i7/ 2.5GHz Core i5 processor option combined with 2GB and 4GB NIVIDIA 1050 graphics options; and the VE version with a Core i7 processor and more advanced NVIDIA 1050Ti graphics. \nAsus didn't reveal the price of the top variant. But going by the international prices of the 1050 and 1050Ti variants -- $1099 and $1,299 respectively -- it could be around Rs 1.1 Lakh. \nThe ROG Strix GL553 models come with 16BG/8GB DDR4 RAM that operates at 2400MHz and can be expanded up to 32GB capacity. For storage it keeps a 1TB 7200rpm HDD as standard and a 128/256GB SATA3 SSD as an optional add-on. \nThe GL553 notebooks come with a 15.6 inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS panel with 60Hz refresh rate and 300nits brightness. It has a RGB backlit chiclet keyboard with a dedicated Num Pad, though the design doesn't look any better from previous year's models that had a very short key travel.

Though the Pascal variants of the graphics cards it uses are cheaper than the GT 980 graphics that were earlier in use. Still we don't see an effective cut down in price. The GT 1050 is the most basic model among all Pascal cards launched by NVIDIA. \nPorts include one Ethernet, one USB 3.0, one USB 3.0 Type C, one USB 2.0, one each of HDMI and 3.5mm mono jack and a 2-in-1 card reader. IT has the 802.11ac Wi-Fi + BT4.0(Dual Band) that includes control algorithm to \"manage network traffic and boost game traffic across wired or wireless connections\" and use multiple connections at any point with Multi-gate teaming.
