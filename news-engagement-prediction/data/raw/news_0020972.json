For instance, temperatures Tuesday afternoon reached near 70 across parts of Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, while southern Maine was in the teens.\nAs storms grow, they love to use this contrast in temperature as fuel. The bigger the temperature contrast these winter storms have available, the stronger they can often become. Thursday’s storm will eventually become quite intense, but it’s also going to be moving rather fast, precluding a blockbuster event.\nvia GIPHY\nA rapidly developing area of low pressure will bring snow and wind to southern New England Thursday. Credit: Tropical Tidbits\nThe storm will arrive around sunrise Thursday and depart after the evening commute, but the effects of it could begin as early as late Wednesday and last into Friday. On Thursday, it’ll basically be a 12-hour blast of wind and snow, which will pile up to between eight and 14 inches around Boston.\n—David Epstein\nYou should plan on difficult travel Thursday. I expect winds to increase along the coastline and whiteout conditions are possible for a few hours.\nTides will be what we call astronomically high on Thursday. In other words, of all the tides this month, Thursday’s are among the highest. This means some coastal flooding is possible at high tide in the late morning and, perhaps again, in the evening.\nBehind this weather system, a cold and bright day is on tap for Friday. There won’t be much melting, with temperatures in the 20s.", "external_links": ["http://giphy.com/gifs/mortal-gruesome-brutalities-sbYP9PtdaRVsY"], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:02:44.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
