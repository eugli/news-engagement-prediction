Brock Lesnar and Bill Goldberg (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 10:51 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 10:51 p.m. ET \nOne week ago on WWE \"Raw,\" Paul Heyman challenged Bill Goldberg to face his client Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania 33. \nChallenge accepted. \nMORE: Legendary tag-team to enter the WWE Hall of Fame \nGoldberg agreed to the match while appearing on \"Raw\" on Monday night, saying he was never one to back down from a fight. Now he will go up against \"The Beast\" one more time April 2 at WWE's annual extravaganza, which this year will take place at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla. â€” WWE (@WWE) February 7, 2017 \nThe two men squared off last November at Survivor Series in Goldberg's first match in more than a decade. The former WCW and WWE champion shockingly defeated Lesnar in 1 minute, 24 seconds . Since then, Lesnar has been looking for revenge. \nThe biggest question now surrounding the bout may be: Will the WWE Universal Championship will be on the line? Goldberg will square off against Kevin Owens for the title on March 5 at WWE Fastlane in Milwaukee. \nRegardless of whether a championship is at stake, Goldberg vs. Lesnar will likely headline WrestleMania 33. The only other certainty about the show is that Randy Orton will compete for the WWE championship. He earned that opportunity by winning the Royal Rumble match . \nBrian Fritz can be reached at .
