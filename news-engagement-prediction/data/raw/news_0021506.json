Highlight of the day \nThe Senate split 50-50, with two Republicans siding with the Democratic caucus, in a vote taken just after noon. Despite hopes from a wide coalition of education activists that a third Republican would step in to sink DeVos’ nomination, no Republican stepped forward. \nBecause the vice president also serves as president of the Senate, Pence was forced to step in to cast the rare tie-breaking vote -- the first-ever such vote needed on a president’s cabinet nominee. After historic vote, Betsy DeVos confirmed as Trump's secretary of education Texas ties \nAt Trump’s meeting Tuesday with sheriffs from around the country at the White House, Rockwall County Sheriff Harold Eavenson complained about a Texas state senator who wanted to make it harder for law enforcement to get control of assets forfeited by drug traffickers. \nThe president offered to intervene. \n\"Do you want to give his name? We'll destroy his career,\" Trump quipped. #oo Z5eWppOTE6mADcwH4xZBvx16fnhcbVeD \nEavenson declined to name the state senator, telling The Dallas Morning News that he’s “not into assassinating his character.” Must-see TV \nCNN anchor Jake Tapper and senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway got into a heated back-and-forth Tuesday about Trump’s media complaints. Tapper confronted Conway about claims that the media has ignored certain terrorist attacks and Conway ultimately acknowledged that CNN is not “fake news.” Her boss has consistently said otherwise about the network. \nBut she said there are “some reports elsewhere, in print, on TV, on radio, in conversation that are not well-researched and are sometimes based on falseness.” Dissenting voices \nRep. Joaquin Castro, the San Antonio Democrat who last week suggested Trump could be impeached if he defied court orders halting his executive order on refugees, is now calling on the Justice Department to investigate the issue. \nCastro introduced a resolution Tuesday in the House that would ask the department to look into whether Trump violated court orders last weekend that paused his executive order banning Syrian refugees and immigrants from several majority-Muslim countries. I urge my colleagues to join me in asking @TheJusticeDept to investigate if POTUS violated court orders related to his Muslim travel ban. pic.twitter.com/kgevKKDQvL — Joaquin Castro (@JoaquinCastrotx) February 7, 2017 Coming and going \nPaul Teller, a former chief of staff for Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, joined the White House team on Tuesday. He will serve as a special assistant to the president on legislative affairs. Tweeter in chief \nTrump disputed long-running allegations that he is excessively close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and pointed to President Barack Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran, seemingly suggesting he's been unfairly criticized. I don't know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy - yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 7, 2017 What’s next \nAfter clearing DeVos, Senate Republicans are now hoping to wrap up several other confirmation votes this week for Trump’s Cabinet nominees. \nThe tentative schedule for confirmation votes would bring up Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general on Wednesday evening, Michigan Rep. Tom Price for health and human services secretary early Friday morning and former Goldman Sachs banker Steve Mnuchin for treasury secretary on Saturday morning. \nThe Senate’s procedural rules may force the Republicans to hold some of the votes in the middle of the night.
