(Benjamin C Tankersley/For The Washington Post) Avoiding the cookie-cutter syndrome in the suburbs can be hard with so many new developments mirroring the same design scheme. But a new community in Upper Marlboro, right off Route 4, gives home buyers urban-style townhouses with exteriors and a walkable neighborhoods that seem to mimic city living.\nThat’s what attracted Charles and Dara Watson to Westphalia Town Center, a 6,000-acre community where residences will blend with retail, restaurants, offices and outdoor amenities.\nThe couple began house hunting over the summer in Washington, where they both worked. “Needless to say, that was short-lived with our budget. We would’ve either had to buy in a less-than-ideal neighborhood or buy something similar to our current condo,” said Charles. They have lived in their two-bedroom condominium in Capitol Heights since 2007 and plan to move to Westphalia in late spring when their new townhouse is completed.\n[ Where Gyro Copters were once made, a D.C. development soars with industrial appeal ] \nWhile touring the development and looking at the site plan, the Watsons saw that the Mid-Atlantic Builders’ Urban Series was being built in the next lot. “We thought they were single-family homes because they looked so large,” he said.\nThe Watsons said they felt designs from other builders seemed like what you’d expect to see in suburbia. “But Mid-Atlantic Builders made this unique design that we fell in love with,” said Charles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:58:27.516+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
