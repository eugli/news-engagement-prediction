Although four or five men at the car wash were referred to he suggests it was never as many as that. But the fact is, this is an unattractive case on any view of it.” \nSpeaking after sentence, Det Con Adam Cronshaw said: “These victims could have been your friend, daughter, sister or partner. They were dehumanised and deconstructed because of these narcissistic and controlling offenders, who were only interested in greed. \n\"Now they are behind bars these brave girls have hope and the potential to enjoy their lives again.” \nLakatos, of Bradford, admitted controlling prostitution for gain, human trafficking, forced labour and controlling prostitution charges and was jailed for 13 years and seven months. The victims were forced to pick up men in streets around Cheeham Hill \nOrgona admitted trafficking and forced labour charges and was jailed for eight years and five months. Petrovich, of Oldham, admitted controlling prostitution for gain and has been jailed for three-and-a-half years. \nLakatos and Orgona have both been made subject to slavery and trafficking prevention orders. \nIn a statement, the woman who fled the Lakatos sex ring only to be exploited by Petrovich said: “It’s had a very heavy impact on me. Being forced to this job I have lost my cleanliness. I’m disgusted with myself and I will never be my old self again.” \nJudge Michael Leeming said of the woman to the trio: “She’s been so affected she’s been unable to inform her family owing to her sense of shame. She alleges she was raped on three occasions and that three attempts have been made to kill her. \n“You placed this vulnerable woman in a position where she was exposed to that sort of risk by men who were potentially violent - physically violent and sexually violent. \n\"She holds all three of you responsible for what has happened to her, and feels her life has been ruined. Such is the impact offences like this can have on the innocent.” The grim reality of Manchester's seedy underbelly - swarming with kerb crawlers as women sells themselves for as little as £30 \nAhead of the trial of Hungarian traffickers who forced women to sell sex on the streets of Manchester, reporter Todd Fitzgerald spent a night with GMP patrolling the city’s ‘red light’ districts. \nIt’s a bitterly cold Thursday night in Manchester. Just after 7pm. \n“How long have you been here?” \n“A month. Please...police, no business.” \nA Romanian prostitute, just 23-years-old, shoos away a police officer. She’s standing on a dark corner in Cheetham Hill, barely covered, smoking a cigarette. \nDet Con Adam Cronshaw tells her he just wants to check she’s okay. She’s not interested. He’s losing her customers. \nWe drive away. A few seconds later, she directs a punter to a car park. She looks back at us and smiles as she flicks her cigarette and trots off to have sex with a stranger. \nThis is the reality on the streets of Manchester today. The city’s seedy underbelly, swarming with kerb crawlers driving endlessly around a dingy industrial estate looking for a cheap thrill. Young women offering sex for as little as £30. \nDown the road, people tuck into steak at a restaurant, seemingly unaware of what’s going on a hundred yards away. \nA flashy BMW creeps by. The driver must only be 20-odd. A clapped-out Ford swings around a corner. That guy’s in his 50s. Young or old, they're after the same thing. \nWe pull up and speak with a woman DC Cronshaw knows well. She says she’s ‘fine’ and asks how he is. \nThis woman, confident and charming, is here of her own accord and insists she hasn’t been trafficked into the country. But who knows who’s watching her. \nWe move on. A few minutes later, the same woman steps into an Audi. DC Cronshaw pulls the driver over. \nHe claims he knows the woman and is ‘taking her to the shops because she’s cold’. He’s calm, almost arrogant. This isn’t the first time he’s used that line on an officer. The man gives his details and is on his way, prostitute in the passenger seat. \nThere’s no point police arresting these women - or their customers. Vilifying sex workers will only making things worse. \nPolice want to nail traffickers and pimps. Forcing business underground will leave them with little chance of doing that and put more women at risk. Temperance Street during the day \nBuilding relationships with these women is key. Trust is what led to three victims speaking out against Lakatos and co. And it’s what will free more of these women. \nWe spot five or six women in this area - and another three or four around Piccadilly. Some of them know DC Cronshaw and seem to appreciate him keeping an eye on them. Others wave him away, uninterested. \nManchester’s ‘red light’ districts are worked almost exclusively by Eastern European women nowadays. \nThey’re usually members of the Roma gypsy community, trafficked into the UK, groomed by men who promise them a better life. They tell them they love them, showering them with gifts before forcing them onto the streets to sell their bodies. \nWomen from countries such as Hungary and Romania started coming into Manchester around five-years-ago. Numbers have rocketed recently. \nThose working on the streets are in the minority. Most do their business in the dozens of ‘pop-up’ brothels across Manchester, which disappear as quickly as they’re set up. \nWomen, some as young as 18, are physically and mentally abused. They’re trapped, traded like cattle. \nEnglish women are now rarely seen on the streets. Their Eastern European counterparts have taken over. They’re cheaper, mostly drug-free and in abundance. \nThey can make hundreds of pounds a night, typically charging £30 for sex. But if they’re working for someone, they won’t see a penny of it. They’re lucky if they get a hot meal and escape a beating. \n“There’s a common misconception that the vast majority of women working on the streets do so willingly,” DC Cronshaw says. \n“Many are exploited and forced to work in fear of their pimps, often having to endure a miserable existence, being made to have sex with different men over ten times a day, seven days a week. \n“They may not feel they can trust the police and pimps often threaten to hurt their families back home. They feel they have no-one to turn to for help.” \nPolice can only do so much. Officers can keep their eye on women working the streets. But there are hundreds more advertised on the internet, working in rented-out flats, hotels and grotty bedsits. \nThere’s a sense they’re only scratching the surface. It’s taken police a few years to understand human trafficking, but they’re getting there. The latest result proves that. \nThey’re determined to take down the kingpins and patrol the streets at night looking for those living lavish lifestyles at the expense of these vulnerable women. \nOffice also want punters to realise that some of these women aren’t selling sex out of choice. They’re powerless. Beaten, psychologically tortured and with no escape. Just yards from this scene men are picking young women up for sex, and paying them as little as £30 \n“I’d ask men who pick young women up on the streets to consider that each will have their own story to tell of how they ended up working in the sex industry,” says DC Cronshaw. \n“It’s likely that they will be working for a pimp and all their hard-earned money will be going to him.” \nWe pass a few more women near Piccadilly. One is worryingly thin, clutching a polystyrene cup of tea, shaking, her eyes almost glazed over. \nAnother is on the phone. She looks scared and cold. DC Cronshaw tries to call her over. She shoots him a steely glare and tells him ‘no’. \nAround the corner, we pop into MASH. \nManchester Action on Street Health has been based around here for the past seven years and has been helping women working on the streets of Manchester for the past 25. \nFrom sexual health checks and condoms to a warm place to sit and a listening ear, it’s a godsend for many women. \n“It’s about trust,” chief executive Cate Alison tells us. \n“A lot of these woman don’t trust the authorities in their own countries, so don’t over here. This is a neutral space where they don’t feel under pressure. \n“They know they can trust us. We’ve been here for so long. Women working on the streets will tell other women this is a safe place.” \nMASH is about emotional health as much as sexual health. If these women are ever going to open up to the police, it’s likely they’ll talk to Cate’s team first. \n“It’s about understanding them,” she says. \n“You have to talk to them, understand them. Last year, we saw over 800 women. Around 30 per cent were migrant workers. \n“Often, their English is poor, they have little education around sexual health and they’re terrified. We’re able to support them and help them break away from those exploiting them.” \nIt’s reassuring to know a place like this exists. But it’s tragic it needs to. \n“I know we’ll never be able to end prostitution, but at least we can make it safer for all concerned by targeting the pimps and traffickers,” says DC Cronshaw. \n“We are talking about saving a person from modern slavery and a lifetime of misery. These issues will only be changed when our communities step up and actively confront them.” \nThis has been a quiet night, DC Cronshaw tells me. In the height of summer, there would be up to 30 women in Cheetham Hill’s ‘red light’ district - and probably another 20 around Piccadilly. \nEven so, it’s shocking. \nBehind the fake smiles and giggles, some of these women look broken. It’s heartbreaking. \nThe next night, I meet up with a few friends for a drink in the city centre. A cab takes me past where I’d been with DC Cronshaw near Piccadilly the night before. \nA few weeks ago, I’d barely have taken a second look at the lonely woman standing on a street corner. \nThis time, my heart sinks. She looks tired and afraid. \nThis is the reality on the streets of Manchester today. And it’s terrifying.
