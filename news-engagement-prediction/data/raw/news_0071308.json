And you could turn around and walk away,\" Greene told CBC Calgary News at 6 on Wednesday.\n\"They want to take away that right and put you in a situation where you are compelled to answer questions about why it is you want to walk away.\"\nHe said the difference comes down to consent.\nNot answering questions is an offence \"In a compelled [examination], you don't get a choice. You have to answer questions. If you don't, that is an offence, it's a federal offence. It becomes an offence under Canadian law, failing to cooperate with a U.S. officer.\"\nGreene said the bill is getting fresh attention based on U.S. politics.\n\"People thought the U.S. would behave reasonably, we don't have to worry about this,\" he said.\n\"But then you have a president who is elected on saying, 'we want to ban Muslims.'\"\nHow is this power going to be used? He's hoping that sections of the bill will be rewritten with recent events considered.\n\"This bill was sailing through with nobody thinking about it [but] because of the election and also because of the things Trump is saying and doing, that is causing more alarm and more people are saying, 'How is this power going to be used?\"\nBill C-23 still needs a second reading before it goes to committee.\n\"We have to get it right because once the horses are out of the barn, you are not going to get them back in,\" Greene said.\nMORE ALBERTA NEWS | Transit safety boss considers ban on headphones near LRT stations MORE ALBERTA NEWS | Medicine Hat mumps outbreak prompts alert as virus hits hockey team", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:15:54.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
