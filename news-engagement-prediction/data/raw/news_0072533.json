Warren Beatty had to apologise after he and Faye Dunaway managed to read out the wrong winner of the Best Picture Oscar. \nYes, that really happened, just when we were sitting back in our chairs after 200 minutes plus of unsurprising Oscar action. \nWhat on earth happened??? \nWell, Warren and Faye read out the nominations and all went to plan. \nBut as Warren opened the envelope, he seemed to take their time reading out the Best Picture, before handing the envelope to Faye, who announced, ‘La La Land’. Viewers just thought... ‘he’s forgotten his glasses.’ \nHowever, soon after the triumphant ‘La La Land’ producers had taken to the stage and started thanking people, there was a kerfuffle, and it emerged the winner was really ‘Moonlight’. \nAt first, it looked like an ‘Adele Grammys’ moment, a winner thinking someone else was more worthy, as the ‘La La Land’ producer \nBut no, he showed the envelope to the audience, and it did really say ‘Moonlight’. Ouch!!! \nThe ‘La La Land’ people were incredibly dignified, with its producer saying, “I’m delighted to give this to you.” \nWarren Beatty was quick to explain, telling the audience what had happened: “I opened the envelope and it said, Emma Stone, La La Land, that’s why I took such a long look at Faye. He helpfully added: “I wasn’t trying to be funny.” So many marks to Jimmy Kimmel, who mock-shouted at Warren, “What did you do??” before taking the blame on himself, “I knew I’d screw this up.” He didn’t, but something did go very wrong. No doubt investigations are ongoing. Whoops!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:49:02.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
