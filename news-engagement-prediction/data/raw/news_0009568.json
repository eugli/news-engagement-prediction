It’s the absurd government policy of allowing the fringes of the settlement movement to run wild, setting up outposts and flaunting the law, that is the culprit. It’s that policy, or non-policy, that keeps coming back to bite the country in the bottom.The price is huge – not just the monetary cost that numbered in the millions for evacuating Amona, but the risk of putting the police in danger by placing them in an impossible situation. It was sickening to watch the scenes of security personnel being doused with bleach, hit with iron bars and verbally abused by lawbreakers (most of whom weren’t even Amona residents but showed up on their own volition to cause trouble) who contribute nothing to Israeli society.Without even going into the discrepancies between the police kid-glove, no weapons policy at Amona and the full-frontal combat mode they displayed at the evacuation scene last month in the Beduin village Umm al-Hiran, it’s clear that the police showed extreme restraint, much more than they should have in light of the offenses committed against them.These extremist Jewish anarchists must be ostracized from our midst, as in their own warped way they are as great a threat to stability in this land as any Palestinian terrorist. No accommodation for the Palestinians – from a two-state solution to Naftali Bennett’s autonomy on steroids – will ever be acceptable to them, and they will do everything to sabotage any movement toward that eventuality.There should be blanket condemnation of their actions from all sides of the political spectrum, starting from the top. Only a hard line against agitators who would like to turn Israel into a theocracy, like some other countries in the region we rail against, will prevent the ugly scene of Israelis battling Israelis from repeating itself far into the future.
