Other stars spotted grooving behind the wheel include Billy Eichner, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, Blake Shelton, Michael Strahan and Jeff Gordon. \nThe series, coming soon to Apple Music, will feature 16 celebrity pairings riding along in a car as they sing their favorite songs. \nThe preview also indicated the stars would be making some stops along the way, with O'Neal playing basketball on a playground court and Smith seen joining in on a wedding celebration. \nThe series is produced by CBS Television Studios and Fulwell 73 with Corden and Late Late Show executive producer Ben Winston serving as co-creators and executive producers along with executive producer and showrunner Eric Pankowski. \nNew installments of the series, announced at the end of July, will stream weekly on Apple's $10-a-month streaming service. Apple has added original content to Apple Music's offerings to provide additional value for the 15 million people who pay for the streaming service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:13:52.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
