Pakistan court to decide today By Ritesh K Srivastava | Last Updated: Wednesday, February 22, 2017 - 09:11 0 \nLahore: Lahore High Court will on Wednesday decide whether Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed and four others, who have challenged their house arrest in Pakistan, will be set free. \nJustice Sardar Muhammad Shamim Khan will hear their petition today. \nHafiz Saeed, Malik Zafar Iqbal, Abdur Rehman Abid, Qazi Kashif Hussain and Abdullah Ubaid challenged their detention through senior advocate A K Dogar. \nEarlier, the LHC had dismissed a petition filed by a senior advocate Erum Sajjad Gull on 'technical' ground observing the petitioner had not furnished the impugned notification of Saeed's detention. \nThe government on January 30 had put Saeed and four other leaders of JuD and Falah-e-Insaniat (FIF) under house arrest in Lahore under the country's anti-terrorism act. \nIn their petition, Saeed and four others said the government in light of Interior Ministry's order detained them for a period of 90 days (with effect from January 30) in exercise of powers under section 11-EEE(1) of Anti Terrorism Act 1997. \nThey said Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan had claimed that the government was fulfilling its obligations under United Nations Security Council's resolutions. \n\"The government has proved that the Pakistan is a servile and a dependent nation. We have been serving the country like iconic social worker Abdul Sattar Edhi for the last many years,\" they said.
