The girl died after she was hit by an out-of-control lorry in Subang Bestari at 1pm last Wednesday. \nHeng Mun, 23, said her sister took part in lion dance not only as a hobby but a source of income too. \nTears rolled down her cheeks as the grie­ving sibling sang along to the Mandarin song Jin Sheng Yuan (Destiny) by Chinese folk sin­ger Chuan Zi, at the funeral. \nChoo’s lion dance instructor, known only as Yan, 43, also broke down while singing to the solemn tune. \nDays earlier, Yan had asked Choo to hang on and not be afraid as she lay dying in his arms by the roadside. She died an hour after being rushed to a private medical centre in Kota Damansara, Petaling Jaya. \nAlso present at the funeral to pay their last respects were Choo’s family members, friends and schoolmates from SMK Rawang. \nThe prayer ritual started at about 1pm, followed by mourners singing Mandarin songs. Pallbearers loaded the casket onto the hearse an hour later for the funeral procession. \nChoo leaves Heng Mun, a 24-year-old bro­ther and their 49-year-old mother. \nThe girl and her troupe members were off-loading equipment from their truck when three of them were struck by a lorry. The injured teammates have since recover­ed. \nSungai Buloh OCPD Supt Dr Abdul Aziz Awang Darus had said the 63-year-old lorry driver could have had an asthma attack when he lost control of the vehicle and crashed into the truck parked by the roadside. \nThe lorry driver and his attendant were at the hospital and went on their knees to beg for forgiveness from Choo’s family. \nPolice recorded their statements yesterday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:44:54.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
