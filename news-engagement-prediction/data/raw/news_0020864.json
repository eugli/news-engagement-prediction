She was drafted as a free agent, having recently shed 40 kilograms. \nAlready, the Eastern Devils forward has repaid that faith in spades. media_camera Sarah Perkins is becoming a cult figure in the AFLW.

She deserves to be playing with a great group of people like this and she belongs at the Crows.” \nSo much so that she has already been likened to men’s skipper Taylor Walker. Hence the nickname, ‘Tex’. \nWhile Perkins is yet to cross paths with Walker, she indicated the pair had become acquainted before the first bounce. \n“I haven’t seen him around the club, but he did chuck me a cheeky little follow on Instagram and Twitter so I returned the favour,” Perkins said. \n“Hopefully I catch up with him this week after another good game.” \nTwo goals later — and a win away from home — it was indeed another good game. \nTo paraphrase Perkins: it was “absolutely amazing”. media_camera Sarah Perkins loves a celebration. Photo: Quinn Rooney/Getty Images \nPerkins’ leading patterns are terrific. She’s quick off the mark, uses her size to great effect, has a monstrous kick and loves a celebration. \n“It’s my trademark. I’ve done it at club level so I thought I might as well bring something different to the AFLW,” she said of her post-goal salute. \nAdelaide will assume favouritism for the AFLW flag after upsetting the Western Bulldogs at home. \nThe win was emphatic, with the Crows’ stars Erin Phillips, Ebony Marinoff and Chelsea Randall all firing. \nPerkins revealed the win was all the more galvanising because of a delayed flight. \n“We were three hours delayed at the airport yesterday,” she said. \n“We’re going off no sleep here. I’m so proud of the girls.” \nThe AFLW’s latest cult figure indicated life hadn’t changed too much for her since she shot to prominence last weekend. That is, except for a few new followers on social media. \n“I mentioned to a couple of the girls I was trying to go unnoticed and get through the game unscathed,” Perkins said. \n“But I don’t think that lasted five minutes.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T14:22:53.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
