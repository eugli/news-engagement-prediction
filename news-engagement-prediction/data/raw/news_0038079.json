Come evening, guests dining on a terrace overlooking hills, olive groves and medieval hamlets will tuck into a traditional east African spread: injera flatbreads topped with vegetables or meat and spiced with saffron, ginger and curcuma; sambusa – fried dumplings stuffed with lentils or meat; or perhaps zigini – hot tomato stew from Eritrea made with lamb or beef, and seasoned with berbere spice mix. The incongruous meal is prepared by Sara Tagi, a 28-year-old Ethiopian chef at Ethnos restaurant in Villaggio La Brocchi. \nThe classic Tuscan views from the village draw visitors, but the main attractions are the food and the chance to meet and mingle with refugees from Africa, Armenia, Syria, Lebanon and Kosovo. Sara Tagi \nThree years ago Tagi made the treacherous journey from Libya to the island of Lampudesa by sea. She was one of the “lucky” ones: not everybody on board survived. \n“Our boat’s engine broke down. We had no food for days – never slept. Some people fell into the water. They just died, drowning,” she recalls. “Luckily, the Italian coastguard saved us before our boat sank, otherwise I wouldn’t be here now.” \nAfter arriving in Italy, Sara applied for asylum and was offered the chance to work at Villaggio La Brocchi, one of two hotels in Italy set up by the government to provide work and accommodation to refugees. A summer camp event in Villaggio La Brocchi \nEmpty and neglected buildings on a former cattle farm, were given a new lease of life in 2014 under the Italian interior ministry’s Protection System for Refugees and Asylum Seekers (SPRAR). Today, the hotel is home to 38 refugee families, who live in apartments with shared kitchens; guests are accommodated in 10 rooms in another building, called La Tinaia, ( progettoaccoglienza.org , with dorm beds from €25 a night B&B) decorated with wooden furniture and furnishings handmade by the refugees. There is also a library, conference room, exhibition space and classrooms where refugees attend Italian language lessons. \nThe local population is encourage to interact with their new neighbours. Women from nearby towns come for cooking classes led by refugees from Syria and Ethiopia. At weekends, local and refugee children play together in the garden. The Tuscan countryside around Villaggio La Brocchi \n“Sara’s black bread is now famous in the Tuscan countryside,” says regular customer Maria Bianchi, from Siena. “I come here just for this and want to know the secret ingredients, but she never tells me.” \nSPRAR was set up by the government to tackle Italy’s immigration crisis. (Since the start of 2016, an estimated 200,000 migrants have landed on Italian shores, according to the UN refugee agency.) Established in 2014, the programme has so far involved more than 400 Italian towns and accommodated around 30,000 refugees. Other projects include shops such as clothing boutique Nuele near Vicenza; an artisan crochet programme in Galatina, Puglia, where refugees sell their designs to local shops; and a fruit and vegetable scheme in Latina, Lazio, where refugees are given land to grow their own produce, which they then sell at market stalls. Sara makes her Ethiopian bread \nThe only other hotel in the scheme is Hotel Giardino (doubles from €50) in the ski resort of Breno, near Brescia. Here, refugees work in reception, the bar and the kitchens, and take guests on trekking and biking tours across hills dotted with Roman temples, medieval castles and prehistoric caves. They also guide visitors on wine-tasting tours and snowshoe expeditions to old mountain dairy huts, called malghe , to see how cheese is still made in the traditional way. \nFood served at the hotel’s restaurant comes from nearby farms and orchards, and is a mix of local specialities such as hay soup, and dishes from refugees’ home countries. Over the next year the government aims to settle a further 4,500 refugees under the scheme.
