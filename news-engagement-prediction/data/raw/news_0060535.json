He said more than 400 doctors were staying away from work, warning that senior doctors could also join the strike. \nALSO READ: Of Robert Mugabe, Donald Trump and Brexiters \n\"So the doctors are insisting that the government has to offer something on the table on the issue of call allowances and the duty free car facility as promised. Without that, they are not going back,\" said Munatsi. \nAt Parirenyatwa Hospital, Zimbabwe's largest public hospital in Harare, non-critical patients were being turned away and referred to local clinics run by city councils. \nUnited Bulawayo Hospitals in the country's second city Bulawayo put out a notice saying that due to the doctors' strike \"we have resolved to attend to 'dire' emergencies only.\" \nDoctors in the southern African nation last embarked on a major strike in 2014 demanding higher call allowances, but returned to work after President Robert Mugabe's government promised to increase them and provide a car facility which would allow doctors to import vehicles and not pay the duty. \nLast July, doctors joined nurses, teachers and other civil servants in a national shutdown over unpaid wages, which coincided with anti-government protests called by social media groups over a deteriorating economy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:55:21.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
