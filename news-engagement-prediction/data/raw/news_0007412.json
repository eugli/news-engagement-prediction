he's back, Tim Paine is keen to cash in on his recall to Australia's Twenty20 squad. \nThe Hobart Hurricanes captain re-joins the national set-up for the upcoming three-match series Sri Lanka off the back of strong performances with both bat and gloves in the Big Bash League (BBL). \nThe 32-year-old says his game is almost back to the level it was in 2011 when he was last in Australian colours in both limited overs formats. \n\"Probably not as good as it was then but I think most of it is a mental thing and it's something that I'm gaining back,\" Paine said. \n\"My strength as a cricketer was always my confidence and my belief in myself and that's probably something that's gone missing in the last four or five years. \n\"It's slowly coming back and I'm really enjoying my cricket and my confidence is back to a level where I'm playing decent cricket again.\" \nMatthew Wade currently sits as Australia's number one wicketkeeper, but Paine thinks this series is as good a chance to climb the queue of glovemen pushing for selection. \n\"I think you've got to see it as an opportunity,\" he said. \n\"Obviously some of the big boys are away so it is a bit of a rebel tour, but again it's just an opportunity for guys to play on the big stage and if someone grabs their opportunity I'm sure it will put you back in calculations for other formats as well.\" \nDespite falling behind Wade and Peter Nevill for selection in recent years, and battling form in his time out of the international set-up, Paine says he always thought his best was good enough to again demand selection. \n\"I always had some hope that if I could get back to playing my best cricket I'd be an outside chance and if a few things go your way then you never know,\" he said. \n\"I've just tried to enjoy my cricket again this year and I think my results across the board have been really good.\" Paine happy to bat down the order for Australia \nPaine has fallen behind Jake Doran as Tasmania's first-choice Sheffield Shield wicketkeeper, but his form in the white ball game has remained strong in the last few seasons. \nWhile the Hurricanes struggled again this BBL season, Paine shone at the top of the order, but with Aaron Finch and Michael Klinger in the side he is expecting to play a different role. \n\"I'm actually hoping I do get to bat down the order because it's something I think I can do pretty well and something I haven't had the chance to do,\" he said. \n\"Looking at other Australian teams I think the keeper has got to bat down the order in white ball cricket now that the top order is so strong. \n\"It's a really good opportunity for me to show that I can bat down the order and I'm looking forward to that.\" \nDespite leading the Hurricanes for the last few seasons, there are no guarantees that Paine will remain in Hobart for the next BBL season. \n\"I'm out of contract, so we will just have to wait and see what happens,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published":
