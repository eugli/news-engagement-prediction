Kellyanne Conway (alongside White House adviser Steve Bannon) evoked a massacre that appears to have never happened in a Thursday night interview. (JOSHUA ROBERTS/REUTERS) \n\"This is the message (Conway) is sending to Iraqis: I hate you & make stuff up, now please help our deployed US personnel in Iraq,\" Democratic California Rep. Ted Lieu tweeted after viewing the segment . \nThe White House did not immediately return a request for clarification, but it's possible Conway was referring to Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, 25, and Waad Ramadan Alwan, 41 - two Iraqi nationals who were sentenced to long prison sentences for taking part in attacks against U.S. troops in their homecountry in 2011, according to the Justice Department. \nThe two men lived in Bowling Green, Kentucky at the time of their indictment, but there is no information about either of them carrying out a \"massacre\" - or any violent offenses, for that matter - on U.S. soil. This undated photo provided by U.S. Attorney's Office Western District of Kentucky shows Waad Ramadan Alwan. From a Kentucky college town, Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, Iraqi refugees plotted to send sniper rifles, Stinger missiles and money to al-Qaida operatives waging an insurgency back home against U.S. troops. The scheme was foiled and both are in prison, but the case has left jitters about whether terrorists might slip in among Syrian refugees resettling in the U.S. (U.S. Attorney's Office Western District of Kentucky/Daily News via AP) (U.S. Attorney's Office/AP) This undated photo provided by U.S. Attorney's Office Western District of Kentucky shows Mohanad Shareef Hammadi.

The review was, however, not in any sense a ban. \nSean Spicer compares 'alternative facts' to weather forecasts \nConway's conspicuous \"massacre\" comment comes less than two weeks after she defended false assertions about the size of Trump's inauguration crowd as \"alternative facts.\" \n\"You're saying it's a falsehood. And they're giving — Sean Spicer, our press secretary — gave alternative facts,\" Conway told NBC's Chuck Todd about Spicer's claim that the Jan. 20 crowd was \"the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period.\" \"Most people don't know that because it didn't get covered,\" Conway said of the apparently fake massacre. (Evan Vucci/AP) \nTodd scoffed in response, \"Alternative facts aren't facts, they are falsehoods.\" \nThe exchange went viral immediately and prompted the \"Alternative Facts\" hashtag to trend across multiple social media platforms.
