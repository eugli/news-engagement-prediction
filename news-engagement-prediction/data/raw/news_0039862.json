Photo: Edwina Pickles \n\"We do need traffic flow, thus people past the door. I don't believe that there are many street sites that fit in Sydney, but Melbourne is a different story,\" Mr Brown told Fairfax Media. \n\"It appears that most ages are embracing the Miniso brand, in fact cosmetics are accounting for some 15 per cent of turnover. \n\"There are more stores currently in China, but in a short space of time they open so many worldwide. More than 50 in Hong Kong and they were opening five per week in Singapore and recently the first mega store opened on the outskirts of Bangkok and the turnover is outrageous.\" \nHead of retail and national director at Colliers International, Michael Bate, said Miniso was \"fast, flexible and on point\". \n\"And importantly has an online presence that can target its market, ensuring its success,\" he said. \nMr Bate said the Australian retail market was very complex and the brands that knew their target audience would survive. \n\"Miniso has tested the waters and now where they want to be in Australia,\" Mr Bate said. \nMr Brown said Miniso intended to \"cover the whole country eventually\". \n\"Possibly in 2018 we will go north to Queensland. And then follow it up in all states of Australia,\" Mr Brown said. \n\"Given the current turnovers I believe that this concept will continue to thrive. There are some 300 new items every month that will appear in the stores and really at a great price point. \n\"The mix caters for all genders and age groups, and I do believe that by 2020, we will be Australia-wide. And as a group they are planning 6000 stores worldwide.\" \nNational director and head of retail leasing at Cushman & Wakefield, Matt Hudson, said the opportunity for growth for brands like Miniso was greater given their adaptive size model and ability to secure sites in key locations. \n\"Brands like Miniso have a simple philosophy of what customers want, which is quality, speed and affordability,\" Mr Hudson said. \n\"If you get that recipe right, your thrive, but as we have seen recently, the brands that don't, won't survive.\" Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:30:47.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
