Maxwell was bumped up from his role as executive vice president and chief administrative officer last month when Presbyterian's previous president and CEO, James Hinton , stepped down. Hinton, who was with the nonprofit for 21 years, started his new position as president and CEO of Baylor Scott & White Health in Texas on Jan. 16. Hinton announced his departure in October. Presbyterian Healthcare Services has named ​Dale Maxwell as its permanent president and… more Photo courtesy of Presbyterian Healthcare Services Maxwell has been with Presbyterian for 16 years, also serving as senior vice president and chief financial officer before becoming executive vice president. He has held various roles throughout the system's various provider branches including the Presbyterian Medical Group, Presbyterian Health Plan and Presbyterian Delivery System. He told Albuquerque Business First that he has used the last few months to reflect on the organization and to survey employees as well as the board of directors. He will use his findings to guide his leadership style. \"We have the right strategy moving forward, so I wouldn't say I'm going to do anything radically different, but my focus and what I think is important to our future as Presbyterian, there are really three key areas,\" he said. Those areas are improving the skills of the company's 12,000 employees, bettering the experiences and health outcomes of its 460,000 members and having a focus on the future. \"I will continue to find ways to grow our business and I will continue to work on ways to transform our business to meet the demands and change that are coming at us in health care,\" he said. In a press release from Presbyterian, board chair Katharine Winograd said Maxwell has the right experience to lead the state's largest private company into its next chapter. \"Dale has extensive experience with an integrated health care model, a strong leadership style and an unwavering commitment to improving the health of the people we serve,\" Winograd said. \"The board is confident that he will continue to lead Presbyterian with integrity at this time of unprecedented change in health care.” The system is preparing to open a new medical center in Santa Fe in late 2018 , which will sit on 40 acres and serve its 37,000 members in the area. Presbyterian is also expanding its health plan in partnership with a group of 11 North Carolina health systems , which will help the local provider deliver its health care strategies to other states. As for other changes with the company — mainly with the possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act — Maxwell said he will wait and see on what course of action to take, if any. \"For right now, until we see something more definitive, I think it's more important for us to continue to focus on our purpose, which is to improve the health of the patients, members and communities that we serve and continue to focus on our strategy of better health, exceptional experience, cost and leadership,\" he said. The system saw no significant increase in patients last year, Maxwell said, attributing that to New Mexico's flat population growth. However, the state's population is predicted to tick up this year , according to estimates from Business First parent company American City Business Journals. Presbyterian's revenues rose from $2.9 billion to $3 billion last year, according to spokeswoman Amanda Schoenberg.
