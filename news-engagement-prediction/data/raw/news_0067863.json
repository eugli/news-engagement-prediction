All rights reserved. \nSoria had 42 saves for the Royals in 2008 and 43 more in 2010. He compiled 160 over a five-year stretch before needing a second Tommy John surgery in 2012. He left the Royals and collected 44 additional saves in four years with Texas, Detroit and Pittsburgh before returning last season. \nHis first appearance foreshadowed the rest of the season. Soria was brought in to start the eighth inning of the season opener with the Royals leading the New York Mets 4-0, and he retired three of the seven batters he faced, allowing three runs on three hits and two walks. \nBy the end of the year, he’d gone 5-8 with a career-worst 4.05 ERA. He surrendered a career-high 10 home runs in 66 2/3 innings. And he had become the focus of fan discontent. \n“You just have to move on,” said Soria, who still has a career 2.76 ERA. “It was just one of those years. It happens. You put that away and move forward.” \nSoria, who turns 33 in May, said he quickly erased any memory of the abysmal season. \n“I did it Day One. I didn’t give myself the whole offseason to think about what went right or what went wrong. It was just a (bad) year,” he said. “This is what I love to do. It is not that I don’t think about it. But you have to move forward. In any job, you have rough years or rough months.” \nSoria’s decline last year was not because of a velocity drop, which so often is a sign of an aging pitcher breaking down. In fact, his average fastball was 92.45 mph, the highest of his career. \n“That kind of goes two-fold,” Henry explained. “Your velocity goes up and sometimes you get carried away, try to throw a little harder and the ball elevates. Even though we think we’re throwing good pitches, sometimes they might be flat and elevated a little bit.” \nSo what was the culprit for the season-long struggle? Well, confidence may have been part of it. Bad luck, too. But Soria insists the pressure that came with his big contract was not a factor. \n“I never tried to impress anyone last year,” he said. “I don’t have regrets from last year because every time I was out there, I was prepared and gave 100 percent effort. The results sometimes weren’t there, but that’s something I can’t control.” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:30:58.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
