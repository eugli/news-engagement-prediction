Its pest control vendor who was on-site captured the animal and released it into the wild. \nThe pool was subsequently cleaned and water quality tests were run to ensure the pool was fit for patrons' use the next day, Sport Singapore added. \n“We are investigating the matter and will ensure our facilities continue to be safe for our patrons. We assure everyone that their safety is our top priority and the hygiene level at our pools strictly adhere to the required standards,” said Mr Ramasess Ramakrishnan, Centre Manager, Jurong East Sports Centre. \nChannel NewsAsia has reached out to the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES) for comment. - CNA/dl", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T12:55:52.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
