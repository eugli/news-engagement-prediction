Jacqui Maxwell, told local media the flag violated Navy rules because of its political nature. \n“DOD and Navy regulations prescribe flags and pennants that may be displayed as well as the manner of display. The flag shown in the video was unauthorized,” she said, according to The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, Va. \nMaxwell described the investigation as a command inquiry that could lead to punishment if warranted. She also said it wasn’t immediately clear if those involved were SEALs or support staff. \nThe Navy repeatedly warned personnel against appearing to endorse a candidate in an official capacity, the paper reported. \nThe Herald-Leader on Monday posted on its website video of the convoy on I-65 that was shot by a goat farmer from Shepherdsville, Ky. \n“I just thought it was just a bunch of military vehicles,” Steve Thompson told the paper. “I was surprised because I figured you wouldn’t be able to fly anything on a Humvee other than an American flag.” \nThe paper reported Thursday that a Kentucky-based anti-Trump group was one of the first to post video of the incident on its website, calling it “a fascist tactic” that “is not acceptable. RESIST!!!” \nThe paper also reported that many Trump supporters took to social media to say that nobody should be punished for showing their support for the nation’s commander-in-chief.
