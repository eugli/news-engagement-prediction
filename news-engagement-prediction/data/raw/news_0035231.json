BEVAN READ \nThe SIgn of the Kiwi cafe still stands on Dyers Pass Road in the Port Hills. \nThe roadside on the way up from Governors Bay shows little sign of damage and the cafe appears normal, with cushions still propped in the window. \nBellbirds are still singing in the trees. \nBut just 50 metres down the valley, a strip of inky hillside shows where the fire licked through the scrub perilously close.
