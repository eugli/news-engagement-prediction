Back in early 2013 Jameis Winston, likely unknowingly, began this tradition by throwing a ball over the Pi Kappa Alpha (PIKE) fraternity house.\nIn 2015, Sean Maguire put his own spin on the new tradition by throwing a football over the high wall of Doak Campbell Stadium from the parking lot.\n@seanmaguire_10 #TrickShotSaturday #GoNoles #GoJesus pic.twitter.com/6ere3ZYRvI\n— Tyler O'Brien (@_TylerOBrien) December 12, 2015 Now current FSU starting quarterback Deondre Francois has returned to the roots of the tradition at the PIKE house and put his own stamp on the tradition Jameis Winston began over four years ago. After Winston accomplished the feat, he went on to lead FSU to a national championship. Could that mean the same for FSU and Francois in 2017?\nWatch Deondre Francois throw a football over the pike house pic.twitter.com/WDc6dyVALA\n— zachboivin (@ZachBoivin17) February 18, 2017\n2/17 Entry @ 7 a.m. -- Dalvin Cook To Tampa Bay?

The ACC and SEC lead them all with 13 players each. Florida State along with 8 other teams have a pair of players on the list. Only 3 other teams have more, with 3 each.\nThe two FSU players on the list are infielders Taylor Walls and Dylan Busby.\nWith 4 winners since the award was first presented in 1978, no college baseball program in the country has won the award more than Florida State : outfielder Mike Fuentes in 1981, pitcher Mike Loynd in 1986, outfielder J.D. Drew in 1997 and catcher Buster Posey in 2008.\nD1Baseball.com released their power rankings for starting pitchers today with a trio of Noles on the list of 200. The rankings are who they say have talent, proved themselves against top competition in summer ball and look poised for a breakout year and not a ranking of pro prospects.\nCole Sands is the top FSU pitcher on the list at #63, followed by Drew Carlton at #73 and Tyler Holton at #101.\nD1Baseball.com has also looked ahead to the 2018 MLB Draft and listed their top 150 sophomore prospects .

Florida State quarterback Deondre Francois was given 14/1 odds to win the trophy based on a release by a popular betting website. Here is what Sports Illustrated had to say about Francois:\nYou could have made the case for betting on Francois to win the Heisman last year. Like former Florida State star Jameis Winston, Francois was taking over the Seminoles' staring quarterback job as a redshirt freshman after arriving in Tallahassee as one of the top quarterback recruits his class. Like Winston, Francois had made a really strong impression during the spring game that year. Like Winston, Francois had been engaged in a battle for the top spot on the depth chart during the summer. Yet two things quickly became clear that all but precluded Francois making a run at college sports’ most coveted individual honor. First, unlike in Winston’s Heisman-winning season, the Seminoles fell out of national championship contention over the first month of the season (losses to Louisville and North Carolina). Second, Francois had not developed into a passer of Winston’s caliber. The Seminoles were better off asking Dalvin Cook to do the heavy lifting on offense while Francois got his bearings at the controls of Jimbo Fisher’s pro-style scheme.\nWith an off-season to conduct the first-team offense as the unquestioned starter, Francois will enter 2017 more prepared to put up the numbers he needs to contend for the Heisman. And if the Seminoles can stay in the hunt for a playoff berth, Francois will benefit from marquee games with national championship implications.\n2/12 Entry @ 3 p.m. -- Recognition Continues for Xavier Rhodes Former Florida State cornerback Xavier Rhodes has been declared the best draft pick by the Minnesota Vikings over the past five years according to Fox Sports.\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Rhodes led all NFL cornerbacks in run defense grades with an 86.4 which barely edged out his former teammate Ronald Darby's grade of 86.3. No other corner graded out higher than an 83.5.\nRhodes was the first of two cornerbacks who have been drafted in the 1st round during the Jimbo Fisher era when the Vikings took him with the 25th overall pick in 2013. Jalen Ramsey was the other with the 5th overall pick in 2016.\nWell Worth It! @FOXSports declared Xavier Rhodes best Vikings draft pick in last 5 yrs. #1on1 #PlanetXay #VKNT pic.twitter.com/kRwn1WfP9i\n— VikingNations (@VikingNations) February 12, 2017 Best run defense grades among CBs\nXavier Rhodes, MIN, 86.4\nRonald Darby, BUF, 86.3\nBrent Grimes, TB, 83.5\nAqib Talib, DEN, 83.2 pic.twitter.com/AeNOltuhZW\n— Pro Football Focus (@PFF) February 12, 2017", "external_links": ["https://t.co/6ere3ZYRvI", "https://twitter.com/Singleshot25/status/832380854274052097", "https://t.co/kRwn1WfP9i", "https://twitter.com/NFL_CFB/status/832275264499544065", "https://res-3.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/y9i7uesuqa1walooqnlg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrickShotSaturday?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/ZachBoivin17/status/833097466312536067", "https://d1baseball.com/position-power-rankings/position-power-rankings-starting-pitchers/?utm_content=UA-58479668-1&utm_campaign=UA-58479668-1&utm_source=UA-58479668-1&utm_medium=UA-58479668-1&utm_term=UA-58479668-1", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/mockdraft?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/1on1?src=hash", "https://t.co/WDc6dyVALA", "https://twitter.com/chad_reuter", "https://t.co/AeNOltuhZW", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlanetXay?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFLCombine?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/VKNT?src=hash", "https://t.co/jC77VGnxVz", "https://twitter.com/PFF/status/830796123375857664", "https://res-3.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/y9i7uesuqa1walooqnlg)", "http://www.si.com/college-football/2017/02/08/heisman-trophy-betting-odds-candidates?xid=socialflow_twitter_si", "http://web.usabaseball.com/article.jsp?ymd=20170119&content_id=216039858&vkey=news_gsa", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bears?src=hash", "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000786173/article/reuter-4round-mock-draft-top-talent-drops-with-early-qb-run?campaign=tw-cf-sf56598039-sf56598039", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/kywzapfwokh3mrf2z8u7", "https://t.co/WlGuD22BBC", "https://t.co/30UN124KuU", "https://twitter.com/FOXSports", "https://twitter.com/VikingNations/status/830579304048242688", "https://www.instagram.com/warchantofficial/", "https://twitter.com/Singleshot25/status/832283429228126210", "https://www.facebook.com/warchantcom/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoNoles?src=hash", "https://d1baseball.com/prospects/top-150-college-prospects-2018-draft/", "https://twitter.com/seanmaguire_10", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/FSU?src=hash", "https://t.co/8OePcu9oQa", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/kywzapfwokh3mrf2z8u7)", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoJesus?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/warchant", "https://twitter.com/_TylerOBrien/status/675755156269592576"], "published": "2017-02-19T15:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:47:54.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
