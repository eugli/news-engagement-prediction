(Photo: Getty Images) \nStory Highlights Arizona's economic growth could jump to 3.6 percent this year from 2.1 percent, says a report Economists at Wells Fargo Securities partly credit state-government efforts to lure new businesses More people are moving to Arizona again, with the population projected to pass 7 million this year CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE A new report sees Arizona shifting into higher gear this year, with the pace of economic growth nearly doubling and the state's population passing 7 million.\n\"Real GDP growth has ramped up as long-standing efforts to diversify the state’s economy are beginning to pay off in a big way, just as the inflows of retirees and tourists kick back into high gear,\" wrote Mark Vitner and Jamie Feik, economists for Wells Fargo Securities.\nThey see Arizona's gross domestic product rising 3.6 percent in 2017 after an estimated gain of 2.1 percent in 2016. That would beat the company's forecast for 2017 U.S. GDP growth of around 3 percent.\n\"Arizona’s economy appears to have had solid momentum going into 2017, as evidenced by the continued slide in the unemployment rate and growing list of corporate relocations and expansions,\" the economists added. They cited Intel's recent decision to invest $7 billion at an existing plant in Chandler , an expansion announcement by Raytheon Missile System in Tucson and Apple's intention to start manufacturing at a Mesa factory.\nThe state's jobless rate, which averaged 5.5 percent in 2016, could ease to 4.8 percent this year, according to the forecast.\nArizona's job growth slowed down a bit late last year, but Vitner and Feik suggested that might be an anomaly. \"Arizona’s health care and construction industries led employment growth in 2016,\" they reported. \"Both sectors benefit from the continued influx of new residents into Arizona.\"\nArizona's growing population Wells Fargo projects Arizona's population will end 2017 around 7.05 million residents, up from an estimated 6.93 million in 2016. Net migration to Arizona reached a post-recession high last year, the report said, with Gilbert, Scottsdale and Chandler all ranking among the nation's 10 fastest-growing cities.\n\"Employers are attracted by Arizona’s lower business costs, particularly relative to other West Coast states,\" they wrote, citing other corporation relocations and expansions including those by ADP, McKesson, ZipRecruiter, Rogers and Houzz.\nAlso, the report said Arizona has made \"great strides\" positioning itself as a leading center for automotive research, with electric-car company Lucid Motors selecting Casa Grande for a manufacturing plant. Google, Uber and General Motors all are testing self-driving vehicles in the Phoenix metro area, while the state also is home to Local Motors, a company planning 3D-printed vehicles.\nPresident Trump's policies could exert a mixed impact on Arizona, the report indicated. Increased defense spending could boost aerospace contractors including Raytheon, Boeing, Honeywell, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Orbital ATK, which announced recent metro Phoenix expansions.\nSETTING THE BAR: Will these economic indicators be better 4 years from now? \nIn fact, Arizona recently was named the best state for aerospace manufacturing by PWC (which also ranked the U.S. as the top nation in this measure). \"Business tax structures and the regulatory environment support Arizona’s standing in this regard, and the aerospace-engineering programs at both of Arizona’s major universities are vital to the sector’s growth,\" wrote Vitner and Feik.\nTrump's vow to increase border security, with more agents on the job, could augment hiring in Arizona, while construction of a wall would stimulate building activity as well as affect retailers, restaurants and other businesses in the southern part of the state.\nHowever, the economists noted that any impenetrable barrier would pose risks to the state's trade with Mexico. Arizona exported $7.7 billion worth of goods to Mexico and imported $6.9 billion from Mexico in 2016, according to the report. The declining value of the Mexican peso against the dollar also could disrupt cross-border trade, they added.\nDonald Trump's border wall Watch: Impact of Trump's wall President Trump orders border wall 4 reasons Mexico hates Trump's wall A new low in U.S.-Mexico relations? Border Patrol chief ousted Quiz: How much do you know about immigration? FULL COVERAGE Arizona's labor market relies heavily on migrant workers, the report noted, so an immigration crackdown could have adverse consequences for the state's economy. \"Filling open positions may become more difficult in construction, food services and agriculture,\" noted Vitner and Feik.\nHomebuilding has been a soft area for Arizona's economy, according to the economists, thought they noted this has helped to keep inventories low and price appreciation moderate — possibly laying the seeds for improvement ahead.\n\"Arizona remains quite affordable, particularly relative to other western states,\" the report said. \"Lower prices are helping attract highly coveted young college graduates, which is helping fuel growth in the region’s tech and aerospace sectors.\"\nMORE: Buying a new house in the Phoenix area in 2017? It's gonna cost more \nAccording to a Penske Truck Rental report cited by Wells Fargo Securities, Phoenix ranked third after Atlanta and Dallas for the most incoming one-way truck rentals in 2016 — a good sign. \"Strong population gains and solid job growth should help drive home sales and new home construction,\" wrote Vitner and Feik.\nA report by Wells Fargo Securities one year ago didn't predict GDP gains for Arizona but indicated the state \"finally appears to have some momentum behind it\" following a slow period of post-recession recovery.\nReach the reporter at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8616.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:40:00.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
