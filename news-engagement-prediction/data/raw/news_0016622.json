She was later pronounced dead in hospital \nDetectives are hunting for the driver of a small white car who fled the scene leaving the recently married victim lying in the road. \nMrs Szucs, who moved to the capital from from Hungary several years ago, was returning from a late shift at a warehouse in Edmonton when she was knocked down in Bounces Road, near her Enfield home. \nShe married Tamas Mezo, who works as a porter at an exclusive hotel in Knightsbridge, in March last year. Female cyclist fighting for life after crash on cycle superhighway \nA colleague told the Standard: “I’ve never met anyone so positive, she always had a smile on her face. Everyone knew her at work, we’re all feeling shocked and numb. \n“She had just got married in the summer. They saved up for a honeymoon in Japan. She was only 30. \n“I can’t get my head around the fact she was just left in the road. What was the driver thinking leaving the scene?” \nPolice said they believe the car would have been extensively damaged in the collision, with a broken windscreen and dents to its bonnet. Mrs Szucs was returning from a late shift at a warehouse when she was hit and killed \nNeighbours told how they were woken by the sound of the crash in the quiet road in the early hours. \nJohn Laoutaris, 66, a retired clothing trader, said: “I heard a bang and a scraping noise. We looked out the window and saw her lying there. \n“I would have liked to have gone down myself but I can’t walk very well. It’s very sad. There were a lot of forensics.” \nResident Christella Christou, 55, woke up to find her house cordoned off. \nShe said: “It was a horrible start to the morning. Police had closed all the road. They said it was a hit and run. \n“All I could see was the bike – it was in two pieces. When I saw it I was in shock. \n“The poor thing. God knows how long she was lying in the road. \n“I don’t know how that person can live with him or herself. How will they sleep at night?” \nMrs Szucs is the first cyclist known to have been killed on London’s roads this year. \nJust a few hours after the crash another female cyclist, also in their 30s, was left fighting for life after being hit by a coach in east London. \nThere were ten known cyclist fatalities on the capital’s roads last year, including Italian prince Filippo Corsini knocked down by a truck in Knightsbridge and 15-year-old Nahid Islam who was killed by a motorcycle as he cycled to pick up his birthday cake in Belsize Park. \nDetectives from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit based at Chadwell Heath are investigating. \nAnyone with information should call the witness line on 020 8597 4874 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
