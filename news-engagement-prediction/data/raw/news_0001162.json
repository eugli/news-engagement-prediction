Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. President Donald Trump watches as Vice President Mike Pence swears in Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2017. Holding the Bible is Tillerson's wife Renda St. Clair. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Washington (CNN) New US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson introduced himself to the department Thursday at his first day on the job, urging unity as he acknowledged the lingering strains of the divisive campaign and paid respects to the agency's career men and women. \"I know this was a hotly contested election and we do not all feel the same way about the outcome,\" the former ExxonMobil CEO said, \"but we cannot let our personal convictions overwhelm our ability to work as one team.\" Tillerson started out with a sly joke, apologizing for arriving almost 30 minutes late because he'd been attending a prayer breakfast led by President Donald Trump. \"It seemed at this year's prayer breakfast, people felt the need to pray a little longer,\" he deadpanned, triggering laughter throughout the jam-packed department lobby where new secretaries traditionally greet the staff on their first day. In the leadup to Tillerson's confirmation Wednesday, the White House had struck out at State Department employees, over 900 of whom had signed a formal protest about the President's travel ban, arguing that it would make the US less safe. Read More The so-called dissent cable -- a traditional way for diplomats to register concern about a policy without fear of retribution -- drew a sharp response from White House spokesman Sean Spicer earlier this week. He suggested that those who didn't like the policy \"can get with the program or they can go.\" Tillerson struck a starkly different note that seemed to signal he wants to position himself as the agency's man in the White House, not the White House's man at State. \"I am honored to be serving alongside each of you,\" Tillerson said. \"The individuals who comprise this department are among the finest public servants in the world,\" the 64-year-old Texan continued. \"State Department staffers in the field are not just conduits for policies and plans, you are our emissaries of our nation and the ideals we stand for. When people see you, they see America.\" He suggested that disagreement is fine, but the agency must function as one. \"Each of us is entitled to the expression of our political beliefs, but we cannot let our personal convictions overwhelm our ability to work as one team,\" Tillerson said. \"Let us be understanding with each other about the times we live in as we focus our energies on our departmental goals.\" Tillerson faced a rocky confirmation hearing after lawmakers on both sides of the aisle voiced concern about his approach to human rights and state sponsors of terror, such as Iran, Syria and Sudan, while he was Exxon CEO. His remarks at the State Department seemed designed to try to reassure professionals in the building. Tillerson struck a decidedly CEO-like tone at one point, saying he would be looking to reform the agency to make it more efficient. And in contrast to the President's recent visit to the CIA, Tillerson paid careful tribute to staff who have died in the line of duty. Trump had prompted anger for remarks he made at the CIA in January standing before a wall that memorializes fallen agents, because many felt he hadn't paid sufficient respect to those who had given their lives in the line of duty. Tillerson closed his remarks by noting that in the crowded lobby is a wall inscribed with the names of fallen foreign service officers \"who in the words of Abraham Lincoln gave their last full measure of devotion.\" As the new administration begins, Tillerson said. \"It is important to honor the sacrifices of those who came before us and reflect on the legacy we inherit.\" Once the applause died down, Tillerson and his wife walked to the wall, placed flowers at its base, and then the new secretary of state ran his hand along the names cut into the stone.
