Is this a political laboratory or learning ground for someone?” Shah asked at an election rally in Azamgarh. \nNoting that the state faces a plethora of problems, Shah said “men of steel” are needed to solve them. \n“Problems of Uttar Pradesh can be solved only under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said. \nCiting the BJP’s election manifesto, which claims there has been significant decline in cattle count in UP under Samajwadi Party rule, he said if his party forms the government, it would shut all slaughter houses and ensure that instead of “streams of blood”, those of milk and ghee flow.

What has it done for the country? Rahul must answer this.” Read more UPelection: No post-poll alliance with BSP or any party in UP says Amit Shah \n“Rahul asks what the Modi government has done for the country. Rahul baba, the first thing that we have done is that we have given a PM who speaks. You had given a PM who did not speak for 10 years, and his voice was heard by you and your mother,” he said. \nThe BJP president urged voters to uproot the SP government from the state, and said “achche din” (good days) would dawn upon the state on March 11 when the results are out. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:20:37.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
