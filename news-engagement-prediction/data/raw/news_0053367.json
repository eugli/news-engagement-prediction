And he has has never shied away from adhering to his own advice. In addition to frequently quoting the ancient Greek historian Thucydides, McMaster has taken a hard line on Russia, called for robust engagement in in the fights in Iraq and Afghanistan and expressed skepticism that advantages in technology can make war quicker and cheaper. Here are some of his lines of thought on controversial subjects. Russia Read More McMaster has struck a much tougher tone when talking about Russian President Vladimir Putin than Trump has, particularly with regard to his actions in Ukraine. McMaster has said the Kremlin carried out a \"land grab.\" He also told the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2015 that it was \"plausible\" Russian troops might carry out a similar type action in the Arctic. And McMaster alleged that Moscow has engaged in a variety of tactics, including \"propaganda, disinformation and political subversion\" aimed at fracturing the West -- tactics the US intelligence community later said Russia exhibited during the 2016 US presidential election. These actions were meant \"to collapse the post-World War II --certainly the post-Cold War -- security and economic order in Europe and replace that order with something that is more sympathetic to Russian interests,\" McMaster told a group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington in 2015. McMaster also told the Virginia Military Institute in November that Russia, along with China, North Korea and Iran, represented \"hostile revisionist powers\" that need to be confronted. In order to confront Russia, McMaster, who was tasked by the Army with reviewing the Kremlin's use of \"hybrid warfare\" in Ukraine, has called for a more robust military presence to be deployed to Russia's borders to \"ratchet up the costs\" of future aggression. Afghanistan and Iraq McMaster received the Silver Star for his actions during the Gulf War, but it was his command of US troops in 2005 in Tal Afar, Iraq, that helped shape his views on modern conflicts and his belief that winning war requires forces on the ground that can change the political calculus. He received accolades for his success in pacifying the city at the apex of violence in Iraq, pioneering some of the counterinsurgency tactics that formed the backbone of the 2007 strategy used by Gen. David Petraeus. The general is quick to argue against the notion that new technologies, such as drones, or tactics like Special Forces raids can be a substitute for land forces and engagement with local populations, two main characteristics of counterinsurgency.
