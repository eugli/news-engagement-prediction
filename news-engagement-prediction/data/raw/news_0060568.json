In fact, there’s a plaque memorializing the hole-in-one he apparently hit at his own golf course in New York. \nTrump gave us another reminder of his golfing skills Thursday. \nDuring a manufacturing roundtable, the president coaxed General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt into recounting the story of the time he witnessed Trump hit a hole-in-one. \n“Jeff actually watched me make a hole-in-one,” Trump told the roundtable, just after Immelt introduced himself. “Can you believe that?” \n“Should you tell that story?” the president asked Immelt. Advertisement \nYes — after the somewhat forceful push — the GE executive believed he should. \n“We were trying to talk President Trump into doing The Apprentice — that was my assignment when we owned NBC,” Immelt said (The soon-to-be-Boston-based company agreed to sell NBC Universal to Comcast in 2009). \n“President Trump goes up to a par-three on his course,” Immelt continued. “He looks at the three of us and says, ‘You realize, of course, I’m the richest golfer in the world’ — then gets a hole-in-one.” \n“I have to say, I’ve seen the magic before,” he added, amid chuckles from the rest of the attendees at the meeting, including a grinning Trump. \nGiven that the first season of The Apprentice aired in 2004, the story appears to have been of a different hole-in-one than the one that earned Trump a plaque at his NYC course. \nThe president did have one correction of Immelt’s account. \n“I actually said I was the best golfer of all the rich people, to be exact,” Trump said. \n“And then I got a hole-in-one,” he added. “So it was sort of cool.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:23:29.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
