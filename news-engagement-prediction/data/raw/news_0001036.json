One source told the South China Morning Post that Xiao left Hong Kong “willingly” to assist with investigations on the mainland. \nChen from Zhongzhou Tewei declined to confirm or deny whether the two female bodyguards were provided by his firm, but said the company employed about 30 female bodyguards. Female bodyguards could earn, on average, 40 per cent more than their male colleagues, he said, and an increasing number of women are trying to become bodyguards. \nOnly about 10 per cent of female bodyguards are former soldiers, with most of them being graduates of sports schools or martial arts athletes, Chen said. \n“It is extremely hard to train female bodyguards,” he said. “To qualify as a bodyguard, these women have to pass training and tests of their reflexes and their decision-making skills under pressure and in emergencies.” \nA documentary about Chinese female bodyguards that aired in 2013 said demand for female bodyguards had been growing rapidly in China. The main focus of the documentary, a woman named Liu Lili who wanted to become a bodyguard, had quit her job as an interior designer to join a bodyguard boot camp. – South China Morning Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T16:20:54.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
