TV takes aim at lifestyle vlogger hell Read more \nThe BAAPS put the decline down to financial constraints but fashion and celebrity observers said social media savvy presenters and models were shifting the focus away from appearances to “ relatability ”. \nMeanwhile, the previous generation of models, popstars and reality TV stars are turning their backs on cosmetic surgery, with Katie Price , for instance, having earlier surgery reversed. \nThe writer and former model Natasha Devon , a co-founder of Self-Esteem Team, an organisation that works in schools and colleges across the UK giving classes on mental health and body image, said the changes corresponded with the rising influence of social media on fashion. “When I was modelling more than 15 years ago, the casting director had a very definite idea of what they wanted before you walked into the room: you were a prop in their vision and invariably that meant conforming to a very narrow beauty ideal,” she said.\n“Now, the models who get booked are the ones with the largest Instagram following. Increasingly, these are people who represent a broader range of shapes, sizes, ages and races. In turn, this representation of diversity has, I believe, contributed to people feeling more comfortable in their own skin.”\nIn a fall of 39.9% from 2015, 30,750 procedures were carried out on men and women last year: 28,341 procedures on women, down 39.1%; and 2,409 on men, a fall of 47.8%.\nNadia Mendoza, an entertainment journalist and co-founder of the Self-Esteem Team, said social media celebrities like Zoella were setting the agenda. “With the web, the vloggers and ‘ Insta-famous ’ have risen to the surface, and instead of trading on looks they trade on relatability,” she said. “This means the likes of Zoella, Grace Victory and Iskra Lawrence become the aspirational ones.\n“Meanwhile, those who have had surgery, such as Victoria Beckham and Katie Price, have now had their implants removed, which sends out a powerful message to fans. While people like Danielle Lloyd and Alicia Douvall go on Botched Up Bodies to educate on the horrors of how surgery can go wrong.\n\n“The rise in Botox , teeth whitening, tanning, contouring etc also means there are a lot more options than having to go under the knife.” \n\nHowever, Mendoza said the statistics were not necessarily cause for celebration. “Plastic surgery is still openly celebrated among the rich and famous, including the MTV generation of Geordie Shore and Ex On the Beach, so I would be cautious that this decline isn’t subject to change as young people currently under 18 could still be hoping for surgery when they are of age,” she said.\nBAAPS said that, anecdotally, the number of non-surgical treatments such as facial injectables was still rising steadily. \nA consultant plastic surgeon and former BAAPS president, Rajiv Grover, who compiles the annual audit, said: “In a climate of global fragility, the public [is] less likely to spend on significant alterations and become more fiscally conservative, opting for less costly non-surgical procedures such as chemical peels and microdermabrasion, rather than committing to more permanent changes.\n“Some procedures which have no real non-surgical equivalent such as abdominoplasty and otoplasty (pinning back prominent ears) are some of the few [that] changed little, with demand for tummy tucks actually recording an impressive rise among men.”\nThe top surgical procedure for women was breast enlargement, which accounted for 7,732 operations – down 20% from the previous year. Top for men was rhinoplasty , commonly known as a nose job, accounting for 529, down 35% from 2015.\n\nThe biggest fall was in the number of browlifts, down 71%. The number of men having abdominoplasty – or a tummy tuck – was up 47% with 172 procedures carried out.\nThe BAAPS president, Simon Withey, said: “The 2016 BAAPS audit demonstrates that at the very least, patients seem to be getting the message that cosmetic surgery is not a quick fix but a serious commitment and are as a result carefully evaluating risks as well as the benefits surgery may offer.\n“If it means people are taking their time to be truly sure a procedure is the right investment for them, then this can only be a good thing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:26:21.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
