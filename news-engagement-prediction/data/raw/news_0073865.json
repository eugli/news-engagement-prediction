Image copyright AFP Image caption The authorities set up emergency stations across the city where people can collect water \nThe regional governor of Santiago, Claudio Orrego, said \" We are talking about 1.45 million homes that are going to be affected by the cutting off of the water supply, which will be total or partial in 30 districts.\" \n\"We still do not know when the drinking water will be turned back on,\" \n\"We cannot guarantee resumption of the service until the River Maipo clears up.\" \nThey said the return of water services would depend on weather conditions and storms over the mountains causing heavy rain. \nAt least four people are known to have died in the floods. \nChile's central region has had months of drought and a series of deadly wildfires which burned for weeks.
