Namely, one of the products we regard as healthiest and a remedy for longevity has been corrupted.\n Apparently, even 70% of olive oil sold in the U.S. stores is fake, as they have been cut with cheaper, inferior oils like canola (canola is NOT a true food, but a chemical mix – do not use) and sunflower oil! This is similar to the 2008 practice in Italy. This meant seizure for 85 oil farms that mixed some percentage chlorophyll with sunflower and canola to the olive oil.\nThe oil was mixed, colored, perfumed and flavored too, and these things made the Australian government investigate their oils. The results were awful. After that, not one brand named extra virgin olive oil got the 2012 certificate of approval.\nThese scams made the University of California study 124 imported brands of extra virgin olive oil and they discovered that more than 70% of the samples did not pass the test.\nTHESE ARE THE BRANDS THAT FAILED THE TEST:\nCarapelli\nMezzetta\nPompeian\nMazola\nPrimadonna\nColavita\nSasso\nAntica Badia\nStar\nWhole Foods\nFelippo Berio\nSafeway\nCoricelli\nBertolli\nON THE OTHER HAND, THE FOLLOWING BRANDS ARE TRUSTWORTHY: Lucero\nMcEvoy Ranch Organic\nCorto Olive\nOmaggio\nBariani Olive Oil\nCalifornia Olive Ranch\nLucini\nOttavio\nCobram Estate\nOlea Estates\nKirkland Organic\nHOW TO TEST OLIVE OIL: Additionally, you can also test the olive oil you have at home. You should put the bottle in the fridge for half an hour, and if it starts to solidify, it means that the oil is pure, as it contains a large amount of monounsaturated fat.\nOn the other hand, if it does not solidify, it is fake. Yet, just to be sure, look for official governmental seals of approval on the label, like “Australian Extra Virgin Certified” and “California Olive Oil Council Certified Extra Virgin.”\nWe really hope you find this article helpful and don’t forget to share it with your friends and family.
