However, Trump has made it clear he will continue to fight Thursday’s Appeals Court ruling and is confident in an eventual victory.\n“We will continue to go through the court process, and I have no doubt that we will win that particular case,” Trump said.\nThe 9th Circuit Court ruled unanimously Thursday in its decision to suspend the executive order.\n \n“We hold that the government has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal, nor has it shown that failure to enter a stay would cause irreparable injury, and we therefore deny its emergency motion for a stay,” the court said.\nTrump responded to the announcement, as expected, via Twitter.\nSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 \n\nConservative columnist and lawyer Ben Shapiro argued the ruling was an act of judicial tyranny by the 9th Circuit and could possibly be overturned in the Supreme Court. In an article written Thursday, Shapiro listed the multiple weak points in the judiciary’s ruling.\n  Trump Issues Executive Orders To Fight Gangs & Cartels, Protect Local Cops Actress Goes Off On Ivanka Trump About Working Mothers: ‘Making A Mockery’ Alabama Attorney General Appointed To Sessions’ Seat In The Senate “Perhaps the craziest element of the ruling: The statement that everyone from lawful permanent residents to aliens with a visa traveling abroad has due process rights. The court even says that illegal aliens have due process rights. The Constitution isn’t just for citizens anymore – which begs the question as to why anyone would bother applying for citizenship,” Shapiro wrote.\nOther flaws with the decision according to Shapiro were the court refusing to strike down portions of the executive order and looking for Trump’s motive instead of interpreting the actual text of the law.\nOne of the major criticisms of the executive order was that it focused primarily on Muslims. In fact, the media dubbed it a “Muslim ban.” But, Trump has maintained the move was about keeping terrorists out of out the country.\n“This is not about religion,” he said after signing the order. “This is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order.”\nWhat do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:13:54.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
