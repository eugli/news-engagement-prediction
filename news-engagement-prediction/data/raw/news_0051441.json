For example: Demo URL: http://codepen.io/phyesix/pen/EZebOJ 2. Animation Timing We use the animation timing function when we want to determine how the animation will accelerate and slow down during its movement cycle. We have to determine the speed at which it will move . There are options such as initial, inherit, ease, ease-in, ease-out, and linear… Credit: https://i.stack.imgur.com/qyvON.png Animation Timing Function: Left (ease) and Right (linear) Adjusting your animation is a straightforward process. Using the Cubic-bezier curve as a guide, you can adjust the timing according to your needs. Animation Timing Function: cubic-bezier(.18,.18,.83,-1.33) Information on how to use the Cubic-bezier curve is available on Mozilla’s Developer Website . 3. Animation Delay Animation delay is used when we want to determine the delay time of the animation. The animation gets triggered, then starts 1 second later. For example, we applied the delay to our “Send Feedback” button: Animation Delays: Left (1s delay) and Right (2s delay) 4. Animation Play State Animation play state is used to specify whether the animation should pause or continue. running : Animation continues.
