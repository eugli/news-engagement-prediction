He has something to get off his chest and it might not be good news for Arsenal. Jack Wilshere has a big fan and Manchester City might have an intriguing transfer target. \nThere has been plenty of talk about Wilshere heading to City before, but it has never got beyond the speculation stage. A whisper here, a rumour there, a nudge and a wink. \nIt has always been denied. City have previously claimed they are not interested, Arsenal have steadfastly resisted any notion that one their homegrown players, a boyhood fan, would abandon them. \nIn short, there has never seemed to be a realistic chance that the England international would wear Sky Blue, but that was before Guardiola took charge at the Etihad Stadium, and it was before Wilshere was sent out on loan to Bournemouth , because he was no longer guaranteed regular first team football under Arsene Wenger. \nCity play Bournemouth on Monday night and it seemed natural to ask Guardiola about a player who played so well against his Barcelona side in a Champions League Round of 16 games six years ago, troubling and worrying Andres Iniesta and Xavi, one of the best midfield double acts in Europe. Wilshere in action against Andres Iniesta in 2011 when Pep Guardiola managed Barcelona \nW ilshere’s career has been blighted by injuries since, but Guardiola remembers the teenager who stunned him. He remembers the nights under the lights at the Etihad and the Nou Camp. He does not pay lip service, he eulogises about a “special” talent in English football. \n“I remember in Barcelona and that year we played Arsenal,” Guardiola says, leaning forward his hands clasped together. “He left a massive impression when he came. A high, high level. I know the problem with Jack Wilshere was just the injuries. \n“He’s lucky to play regularly for one season and he is going to be back to being one of the best midfield players in England by far. He’s quality, he’s smart and has the quality on the ball. \n“He has a special quality with the ball, dribbling as a holding midfielder to attack central defenders - it’s not easy to do that. Guardiola is a man on a mission \n“He’s a little bit like Dembele at Tottenham. They have quality to pass, pass, pass and then immediately destroy the defensive structures. I’m so happy he’s back and he’s playing regularly. Hopefully on Monday he can play.” \nS o what does he make of the move to Bournemouth? “That’s a good question,” replies Guardiola with a smile. “He would still be playing for Arsenal if he was fit [before]. I think it was so important for him to be able to play week after week…” \nThere was no declaration of interest, no attempt to unsettle the player, but the warmth of the words, the very deliberate, precise praise and the fact City could do with someone with his particular skill set, to link defence and attack, at least raises a possibility. \nWilshere’s future at Arsenal is open to question. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has already declared he would love to turn his loan move into a permanent switch. He seems to believe there is a chance the Gunners will let him leave too. However, if City enter the running, there is only going to be one winner and it will not be Bournemouth. Where will Gabriel Jesus place in the top 20 Brazilians in Premier League history? \nI t is normal at this time of year for players to start thinking about what they want to do in the summer and at City, Sergio Aguero’s place is in doubt. He is no longer assured of first choice status following the arrival of Gabriel Jesus in January and also has admirers. \n“Sergio knows the intention of his manager and the club,” said Guardiola. “I don’t want to sell him, I want him to stay here for a long time until he decides [he wants to go]. \n“The reason he’s not played the last two games are because Leroy, Gabriel and Raheem have played amazing. That’s the only reason why. The 20 greatest stadiums in European club football \n“At the end of the season, I don’t know, but I know how difficult it is to find top goalscorers. I would like him to stay but I don’t know what is going to happen. Even in my career I didn’t know what would happen at the end of the season. \n“I was clear every time we spoke with Sergio from the beginning. I know his strengths. I know he’s trying, I know how much he fought against Tottenham and how many chances he had. But at Palace I saw three guys in front with a high intensity and said ‘wow, I like what they do’.” \nA guero to Arsenal and Wilshere to City? Stranger things have happened.
