Both were as enthralling for the neutral fan as they were stimulating for long-suffering Dogs fans. \nThe preliminary final was decided by several critical moments at either end of the ground, but nothing quite swings a close game like a clearance from a stoppage or a centre bounce takeaway. \nTo this end, the Dogs had the better of their highly-rated opponents. \nThey won the stoppage count 43-24 and the clearance ticker 53-38. The Giants were forever playing catch-up around the ground to get the contest back on level pegging. \nUltimately it proved too hefty a task and Luke Beveridge’s men prevailed by six points. \nOf course, the result could have gone either way. But the midfield ascendancy was evident throughout the contest. \nChampion Data’s 2017 Prospectus said of the result: “System and process defeated talent against the Giants in the preliminary final.” \nThe evidence? GWS — the best ball movement team in the competition — had 23 fewer inside 50s than the Dogs for the game. They were soundly defeated between the arcs. \nBut with the benefit of hindsight and maybe a sprinkling of foresight, it’s worth asking the question: Who has the better midfield, GWS or the Bulldogs? \nLet’s investigate and put both line-ups under the hammer. \nLive stream EVERY game of the JLT Community Series on FOX SPORTS.

In each of their September outings they lost the clearance count and were outscored from stoppages. \nEven without stats as a guide, footy fans marvelled at their explosive ball movement from congestion. The Dogs were not just able to quell this attribute, but better them at their own game. It was some feat given just how prolific Leon Cameron’s men had been for the entire season. \nStephen Coniglio, Callan Ward and Dylan Shiel registered the 11th, 12th and 13th most clearances in the AFL last year. The highest rating Bulldog was Marcus Bontempelli at No. 26. \nClearly the cream of the Giants crop was super industrious. Three midfielders might win you 16 games, but you need more contributors to win a flag. \nCONTESTED BALL KINGS \nSince Luke Beveridge arrived at the Bulldogs, his team has been the best contested ball side in the competition, averaging 9.4 more hard fought disposals per outing than their opposition. \nIn 2016 alone the average differential was 16.5 more contested disposals per match, the second best ever recorded. The numbers are evidence that not only do the Dogs have several beasts in their engine room, but their collective want to get first hands on the Sherrin is unparalleled. \nDesire plus ability generally equals success. \nBut it’s not as if the Dogs had one or two contested ball machos that carried the group. Rather it was their even spread of performers that made them such an effective ball-winning team in 2016. \nTheir best contested ballplayer was Marcus Bontempelli, who at No. 12 was the only Dog in the top 20 in this category for the year. Indeed Bontempelli’s year was symptomatic of the Bulldog’s rise. \nHe played 70 per cent midfield time. This was the highest percentage at the club, but the lowest percentage of the most common midfielder at any of the 18 AFL teams. \nOthers such as Tom Liberatore, Liam Picken, Lachie Hunter and Luke Dahlhaus were just four of the many ball-winning Dogs that filtered through the engine room with great effectiveness. \nBontempelli plus these four were all ranked in the top 40 for contested possessions last year. \nTo further demonstrate how fruitful this midfield area was for the Dogs, their contested possession differential in that zone was +24, ranked No. 1 in the AFL. Lachie Hunter clears by hand.

But given the rotation systems that exist in modern day football and the strain that’s associated with the on-ballers, the Dogs have the edge over Leon Cameron’s men. \nThe statistics illustrate exactly how the Bulldogs can mix and match with no discernible difference in output. GWS however rely heavily on their top four or five. This is not to say their next half-a-dozen are plodders. It’s more that the Dogs n \nIn short, GWS’s top end is better. But winning the midfield battle required at least 10 players on any given day to perform. To this end, the Dogs pip the Giants. \nBut only by a whisker.
