Al Sharpton (Living Legend Award), Martha Reeves (R&B Music Icon Award) and U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence (LaMont D. Robinson Visionary Award). \nLawrence, U.S. Rep. John Conyers and Detroit City Councilwoman Mary Sheffield were among those on hand for Tuesday's announcement event at Bert's Entertainment Complex in Eastern Market. Also in attendance were Motown mainstays Reeves, Coffey, Kim Weston and members of the Contours. \nThe R&B Hall of Fame, spearheaded by LaMont Robinson, has been in the hunt for a permanent home, with cities including Detroit, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Clarksdale, Miss., among those in the mix at various points. This year's induction ceremony follows the 2016 event at Dearborn's Ford Community & Performing Arts Center. \nTickets for the June 11 Music Hall show are $45-$95 and can be purchased at the venue box office or via Ticketmaster .
