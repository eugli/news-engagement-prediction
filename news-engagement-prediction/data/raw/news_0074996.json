I think the robbers only had the two bullets which they’d fired at my wife. \n“I am a father and man and had no option but to fight. It’s my family,” Molefe said. \nThe family stays on a smallholding in the Grootfontein Country Estate, east of Pretoria. \nMosima and the children were sleeping in the main bedroom. She and the 5-year-old were on the bed and the baby in his cot. \nAt about 01:00 Molefe heard a window breaking and his wife’s screams. \n“I ran to the room. My wife was bleeding, but she still tried to get to the baby. \n“I saw people outside the window and grabbed the baseball bat.” \nHe stormed to the window. \n“I first went for the pieces of glass left in the window pane so that it could hit them in the face. But still they tried coming in and gestured with their weapons. They’d stopped shooting. I struck out at them again and again, anything to keep them out,”fe said. \nThe attackers fled and the dad helped his family to the lounge. \n“My wife was bleeding badly and stated losing consciousness. I phoned a neighbour, who contacted MonitorNet (a security company) and the neighbourhood watch. \nIn the meantime, Molefe had tied towels around his wife’s wounds. \nKnowing that help was on its way, Molefe ran outside and drove the car to the front door so that he could rush his wife to hospital. \n“I first took my sons to the car and put the baby in his brother’s arms. Shame, my eldest was so brave.” \nThe petrified dad threw a blanket over them before running back and carrying his wife to the car. \nIt was just then that MonitorNet arrived. \n“They initially thought I was one of the suspects,” Molefe said with a smile, “but as soon as I’d identified myself, they called the police and an ambulance, saying it would be better not to move my wife as we didn’t know where the bullets were lodged”. \nRudi Engelbrecht, who also stays on a smallholding on the estate and who is on the AfriForum neighbourhood watch for the area, rushed to the scene when the emergency call came, says his wife Zelda. \n“MonitorNet arrived at the scene just before him. It was very misty and my husband waited for the police at the entrance to the estate and escorted them to Michael’s house. He then went back to wait and escort the ambulance so that no time was wasted with emergency services getting lost. \nMosima underwent an operation on Sunday and was out of danger by late Sunday afternoon.
