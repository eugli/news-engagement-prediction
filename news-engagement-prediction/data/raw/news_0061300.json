What was different was the crowd itself — all students from Chicago Public Schools. \nAbout 1,900 Chicago students and their teachers from 30 CPS high schools got to skip school for one of the most memorable history lessons ever — a daylong program that included performances on stage by some of the students, a Q&A session with several members of the cast and a special \"Hamilton\" matinee just for them. \nThe Chicago students had spent the past several weeks studying Alexander Hamilton and the historical events surrounding his legacy. \n\"Are you excited to be in the room where it happens?\" asked Wallace Smith, the day's master of ceremonies, who plays Hercules Mulligan and James Madison in the show. \nScreams. Claps. General mayhem. \nSmith then asked, \"How many of you have seen 'Hamilton'?\" \nA few claps. Mostly silence. \nThat would change. \nIt was the Chicago debut of the \"Hamilton\" Educational Program, which began with the Broadway production last year. The show's producer, Jeffrey Seller, created the education experiment along with Miranda, the Rockefeller Foundation, the New York City Department of Education and the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History — which designed the curriculum and contributed materials the teachers have been using in the classroom. For the day at the theater, the show extends tickets for $70, the Rockefellers donate $60 and the students each pay $10. 'Hamilton' hosts CPS students \nCast of 'Hamilton' hosts CPS students.

When performers hesitated under the lights, the crowd cheered them on. Miguel Cervantes, who plays Alexander Hamilton, could be seen popping out of the wings to film. \nVon Steuben Metropolitan Science Center's Jovan Castillo and Julio Mendez, both 17, performed a rap battle of the Hamilton-and-Aaron Burr duel. They referenced Vice President Mike Pence , finding common ground in the disagreements between Pence and Donald Trump and Burr as vice president to Thomas Jefferson. \nTheir inspiration? \n\"Our inspiration was to get tickets to 'Hamilton,'\" said Castillo in a later interview. \"No, no, we both do love history.\" \nIt is now impossible to watch George Washington make his exit from public life in \"Hamilton\" without the face of Barack Obama staring back at you from the stage.\nIt's not just that the first president of the United States insists to Alexander Hamilton in Lin-Manuel Miranda 's lyrics that \"we will... \nIt is now impossible to watch George Washington make his exit from public life in \"Hamilton\" without the face of Barack Obama staring back at you from the stage. \nIt's not just that the first president of the United States insists to Alexander Hamilton in Lin-Manuel Miranda 's lyrics that \"we will... (Chris Jones) \nA trio took the beat of rappers Lil Yachty and Kyle's \"iSpy\" and turned it into an ode to Philip, Hamilton's oldest child. It was a crowd hit. \nChloe Johnson, a 16-year-old student at Lindblom Math and Science Academy, had worked on her spoken word piece inspired by African-American poet Phillis Wheatley for a month. After the performances, she recited again one of the lines she was most proud of: \"Who would have thought a young black female prodigy would take the perils of slavery and form them into poetry.\" \n\"I'm ready,\" she said, smiling about the upcoming matinee. \"I'm ready.\" \nSmith, the emcee, said watching the student performances was electric. \"I feel like a million dollars, man,\" he said. \"It was a great reminder of why we do what we do.\" \nA Q&A lead by director Thomas Kail followed the student performances, with cast members Smith, Chris Lee, Ari Afsar, Chicago-native Jose Ramos and Samantha Marie Ware. \n\"This matinee is going to be lit,\" Kail said. \nThe cast members answered questions about playing historical figures, how they prepare for the show and which Chicago deep-dish pizza option reigns supreme. For lunch, the students headed to the Palmer House for bagged lunches. \n\"I was moved again by the ingenuity, the passion and the thoughtfulness of our youth, of America's youth,\" said Seller, in attendance for the morning's events and performance. \"I cried. Because when I witnessed these inspired young people testify to their belief in country, testify to the ways in which our history connects with our present, it gave me hope that we are going to be better than just fine, we're going to have great days ahead.\" \n\"It doesn't matter if we're at the Richard Rogers (in New York) or the PrivateBank Theatre,\" said Kail. \"Whenever we do these events, it's just this transfer going back and forth of empathy and community. And that's what's most important. And that's why the show exists.\" \nBack at the theater after lunch, the lights went down. Wayne Brady as Burr came out and began the first line: \"How does a bastard, orphan …\" \nThe students erupted. Brady barreled on. And from then on they were mostly transfixed, losing it only a little during the more provocative lines. They snapped selfies during intermission or else raised a non-alcoholic glass to freedom at intermission. There were \"Ooohs\" of disgust (or support?) during the Maria Reynolds scene, some students finished the Notorious B.I.G. reference \"And if you don't know, now you know\" in \"Cabinet Battle #2\" and the bravest of students shed some tears by the end of it all. \n\"I feel like this is one of the most legendary moments that will ever happen in my entire life,\" said Yoquan Williams, 17, from Excel Academy of Englewood, who said he wants to do musical theater. \n\"I just feel inspired to go out and conquer the world and do what I love to do, which is music,\" said Maisa Muhammad, 15, from Providence St. Mel. \nMaybe one of those students in Wednesday's audience will make the next \"Hamilton.\" Or something even better. \nIt's only a matter of time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:40:56.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
