Very soon, we will win full freedom nationwide and it's going to be with bipartisan support. You can help by checking out the National Center for Transgender Equality, and letting Washington hear you loud and clear.\"\nLink to @TransEquality to tell Washington how we feel: https://t.co/L272I22dN6\n‚Äî Caitlyn Jenner (@Caitlyn_Jenner) February 24, 2017 The reality star and Olympic gold medalist then pivoted to who she called \"the bullies,\" taking aim in particular at Attorney General Jeff Sessions. She also voiced her support for Gavin Grimm, the 17-year-old transgender high school student who is the lead plaintiff in an upcoming Supreme Court case against his school board which, according to the New York Times , could help legally settle the right for transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice and \"could greatly expand transgender rights ‚Äî or roll them back.\"\n \"Now I have a message for the bullies: You're sick,\" Jenner said. \"And because you're weak, you pick on kids, you pick on women, or anyone else you think is vulnerable. Apparently, even becoming the attorney general isn't enough to cure some people of their insecurities. As proof, the Supreme Court will soon hear a very important Title IX case thanks to the courage of a very brave young man, Gavin Grimm. Mr. President, we'll see you in court.\"\nJenner then concluded her video by addressing Trump directly.\n\"Finally, I have a message for President Trump ‚Äî from, well, one Republican to another,\" she said. \"This is a disaster, and you can still fix it. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me.\"\nJenner's message in the video echoes what she's said in the past about her hopes to help Republicans better understand LGBTQ rights from within the party ‚Äî but as many were quick to state in response to her video, the message was too little, too late.\n@Caitlyn_Jenner BISH PLEASE.
