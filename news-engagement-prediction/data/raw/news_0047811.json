The star has teased the release several times in recent months–but with the launch of the official Instagram , we know know what, when, and where it’s launching. The first product drop? A holographic lip product used backstage at the Fenty x Puma spring 2017 runway show . According to a Fenty Beauty Instagram, the full line of products will be available in Sephora stores this fall. An exact release date is TBD, but we’ll definitely accept just a season for now. Another post gave information on where around the globe the products would be available. Sadly, it appears as if South Africa didn’t make the cut—for now, at least. And in true Rihanna fashion, the Fenty Beauty brand has decided to buck tradition and hold open casting calls for brand makeup artists in three major U.S. cities. “By opening this up the our larger makeup community we hope to build a diverse team of beauty experts who excel in the areas of artistry, elevated education, makeup experience and have an ability to best represent a brand. This non-traditional interview process levels the playing field and allows artists everywhere an opportunity and have their work seen and be considered for a global position for a dynamic new brand,” wrote Eric Soto , ‎Global Artistry & Education Senior Manager for Fenty Beauty’s parent company, Kendo Brands, on Instagram. “Those applicants who make it through the first interview phase will be invited to a second interview at a later date and our finalists will have a chance to interview and apply makeup on Rihanna herself.” Long story short: stop reading this right now and call every single one of your makeup artist friends. Talk about the gig of a lifetime. Keep your eyes peeled on the brand’s official Instagram page @FentyBeautyCosmetics for more news as its released.
