I leave that up to them.\" \nJoe Gimenez, a spokesman for the firefighters fund, called Turner's announcement \"disappointing.\" \n\"The mayor is, with that, unilaterally blowing up thousands of hours of discussions that they've had since last summer. I think they are very disappointed that all of that hard work appears to be going for naught,\" Gimenez said. \"The firefighters were ready to continue their discussions. They felt like the term sheets were still coming to fruition.\" \nThe fire fund remains ready to continue discussions, he said. \nTurner provided few details about precisely how the fire benefits will align or not align with the terms the police officers agreed to, saying simply, \"We're making their plan a little bit more analogous to that of police.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:45:05.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
