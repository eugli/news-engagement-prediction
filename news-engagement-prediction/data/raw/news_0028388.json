(ABC Rural: Bridget Fitzgerald) \nA Victorian potato grower says switching to solar will save cash and give him independence from power companies. \nAlan Westbury, who farms at Thorpdale in state's Gippsland region, said he was pleased that solar panels reduced his reliance on his electricity provider. \nThere are 368 solar panels across two sites on his property, which are operating a 200 horsepower electric motor for irrigation. \nMr Westbury said he was looking forward to becoming more self-sufficient while reducing costs. \n\"I spend $130,000 - $140,000 every year on power,\" he said. \n\"[The solar panels are] definitely cutting it back a hell of a lot.\" \nMr Westbury said he had already seen evidence of a reduction in his power bill. \n\"At this stage [with solar] the power bill is about $3,500 a month, where it used to be $7,000 or $8,000 so it's got to be making a difference.\" \nMr Westbury said he was approached by a local solar power company, which sparked his own research into installing panels. \nHe said he would transfer the solar power supply to his packing sheds when he was not using his irrigation. \n\"Because you use sheds all season and the cool store and therefore the [panels] should be able to operate that at no cost,\" he said. \nMr Westbury said he would know definitively whether the panels had reduced his costs by the end of June 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:08:05.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
