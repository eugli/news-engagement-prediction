Did you think it was some sort of shady game to get in your pants? While I can't speak for your ex-boyfriend's intentions, a recent study published in The Journal of Social Psychology suggests that — surprise! — men do fall faster than their female counterparts. This totally debunks the myth that women are the ones who *~fall so fast~* and spend all their time quoting songs about unrequited love.\n OK, the science: the study surveyed 172 college students. Unsurprisingly, both genders thought that women would fall in love before men did (thanks, society, for painting that picture.) But it turned out that the men actually fell first, and they said \"I love you\" before women did.\nIt's important to note that the study only surveyed college students (so not full-blown adults quite yet), but men will be men — and sperm will be sperm. To that end, study author Marissa Harrison suggested one possibility for why women didn't fall as quickly as men did: \"I think women unconsciously postpone love compared to men,\" she told Broadly . \"Women have a lot more to lose reproductively by committing to the wrong man. They are born with a finite number of eggs, yet men produce millions of sperm on a daily basis.\"\nBut there's a possible flip-side to this scenario. Though not explicitly covered in the aforementioned study, the fact that men are predisposed to want to procreate as much as possible might be a part of this. You know, the old cavemen, evolutionary science stuff you might have heard about in biology class.\n\"The male is usually the hunter and is more likely to be immediately stimulated. The woman is more focused on long-term stability because that's better for child-rearing,\" Ingrid Collins, a psychologist who works at the London Medical Centre, told Broadly. \"In my experience as a therapist, men are far more inclined to get fired up about a mate but also more likely to look around more,\" she said.\nWomp womp.\nRegardless, feel free to take this as an opportunity to wave your feminist flag, and don't let any naysayers make you feel weaker: it's a strength to be so choosy and selective about when you'll say those three little words, and to whom. Own it.\nFrom: Redbook\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.2010.522626?src=recsys&journalCode=vsoc20", "http://www.redbookmag.com/love-sex/relationships/news/a48801/men-fall-in-love-faster-than-women/", "http://www.redbookmag.com/love-sex/relationships/g600/unique-ways-to-say-i-love-you/", "https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/why-men-fall-in-love-faster-than-women"], "published": "2017-02-21T11:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:30:59.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
