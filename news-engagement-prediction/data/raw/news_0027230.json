It's a lot easier than walking and running,\" said Ms Mayne said. \nTemperatures dropped to 12 degrees Celsius on Monday with many contestants reaching for their coats and towels as they emerged complaining it was warmer in than out. \nOverall winner Harrison Grant, 17, said low temperatures made warming up his muscles difficult throughout the swim. \nHarrison, who is familiar with swimming in pool events, said ocean swimming had become \"a bit of a hobby this year\" but admitted the swim was \"quite tough\". \n\"It was a tough swim actually. The waves were proving to be pretty difficult but I had my dad there kayaking alongside to keep me in line,\" he said.

(ABC News: Aneeta Bhole) \n\"This is the third time I've been in the Trans Derwent, but the first time I've ever won, so that's a bonus.\" \nCatching her breath as she swam back from the wooden pontoon finish line, 14-year-old Sophie Botterill-James was the first female to make it to the finish line. \nSophie won the overall women's category and junior category but said navigating the cold water against the current was extremely difficult. Photo: Sophie Botterill-James said a Navy boat made her swim a bit tougher. (ABC News: Aneeta Bhole) \nA naval ship which was seen anchored in the middle of the race course appeared to make swimming conditions more challenging for Sophie, who said navigating the water became \"quite difficult\". \n\"When you're behind the boat you can't see where you're going, it's quite wavy when you're getting around that boat area,\" she said. \n\"When you get past the boat it gets a bit easier.\" Weather takes toll on crowds \nDespite the unseasonably cold summer weather, regatta president Geoff Lucas said crowd numbers were looking \"okay\". \nHis only concern was making sure people were having a \"great time\". \n\"You can't count on the weather ... we don't count crowd numbers. We're about people having a maximum amount of fun.\" \nDinghy racing was cancelled on Monday's event due to high wind conditions which made racing unsafe for participants. \nMr Lucas said despite setbacks that there are plenty of other events available for people coming down to the Royal Hobart Regatta. \nAlthough crowds were smaller than the 80,000 seen in the 1955 event, Mr Lucas explained the Regatta was still an impressive example of what a community could do with a small budget.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:10:16.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
