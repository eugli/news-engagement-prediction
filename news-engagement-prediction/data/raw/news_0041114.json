Boston Police Department SWAT Cat in front of her new digs. \nThe calico endeared herself to officers back in 2013 , when she was a scrappy stray hanging around the SWAT headquarters. Soon, she began taking on crucial law enforcement duties, like getting belly rubs and snoozing atop officers’ motorcycles. \nOfficers got her spayed, microchipped with an ID, and vaccinated. But try as they might, they could never get her to be a fully indoor cat. \n“The men and women of the BPD SWAT Team have tried numerous tactics over the years to convince her to come in from the elements but she is set in her ways,” the police department said on its Facebook page. Boston Police Department An unidentified officer works on SWAT Cat's housing. \nSWAT officers built the cat several shelters to protect her from the elements. \nThe new deluxe condo is the best one yet. It features a “studio interior layout,” as well as a deck and glass doors with “panoramic city views.” The police department noted in a press release that Officer Jamie Pietroski stayed late after work several nights to complete the prime piece of real estate. \n“They have built numerous shelters for her in the past ― none more impressive than this one which is fully insulated and suits her independent lifestyle,” the department said on Facebook. Boston Police Department SWAT Cat has been the force's unofficial mascot since 2013. \nSWAT Cat caused a citywide panic in 2015, when she vanished without warning, but she returned to SWAT headquarters a month later, safe and sound. Maybe the new condo will convince her to stick closer to home.
