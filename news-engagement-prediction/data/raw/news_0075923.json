He called it the “imitation game,” but most people know it as the Turing test. Anticipating what we now call chat bots—computer programs that masquerade as humans—Turing envisioned a contest in which a machine tries to trick an interrogator into believing it is human, answering questions about poetry and deliberately making mistakes about arithmetic. Today, in the eyes of the general public, the Turing test is often seen as a kind of a Rubicon, a measure of whether machines have truly arrived. But it shouldn't be: the Rubicon can be passed, though for the wrong reasons. It is now possible to build machines that fool people, at least for brief periods—but the victories are fleeting, and they do not seem to be carrying us even close to genuine intelligence. \nThis is a preview.
