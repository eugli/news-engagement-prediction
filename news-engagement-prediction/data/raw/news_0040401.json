He added that a post-mortem had not yet taken place, and that the body was in Putrajaya hospital. \nYonhap News Agency had earlier reported that the half-brother of Kim Jong Un was found dead in Malaysia on Monday. \nKim Jong Nam was the eldest son of former leader Kim Jong-il. \nTV Chosun, a cable television network, said that Jong Nam was poisoned at Kuala Lumpur airport by two women believed to be North Korean operatives, who were at large, citing multiple South Korean government sources. \nThe report said the two women hailed a cab and fled immediately afterwards. \nIn Malaysia, the police chief in charge of Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Assistant Commissioner Abdul Aziz Ali, earlier on Tuesday told AFP a Korean in his forties was found sick at the airport on Monday. \nAirport authorities rushed him to the hospital and he died on the way, the police chief said. \n\"We do not have any other details of this Korean man. We do not know his identity,\" Abdul had added. \n\"The incident took place yesterday afternoon at KLIA 2,\" a senior police source told Channel NewsAsia on Tuesday. \"The victim was taken to a clinic nearby and later to a hospital. He died on the way there. Investigations are ongoing by CID (criminal investigation department) and we cannot comment further. \n\"No one has been arrested yet. We are looking for the perpetrators.\" \nJONG NAM TARGETED BEFORE \nKim Jong Nam was born from his father's non-marital relationship with South Korea-born actress Sung Hae-rim who died in Moscow, according to Yonhap. \nOnce considered the heir apparent, he fell out of favour with his father following a botched attempt in 2001 to enter Japan on a forged passport and visit Disneyland. He has since lived in virtual exile, mainly in the Chinese territory of Macau. \nKim Jong Un took over as North Korean leader when his father died in December 2011. Kim Jong Nam, known as an advocate of reform in the North, once told a Japanese newspaper that he opposed his country's dynastic power transfers. \nIf confirmed, Kim's case would be the highest-profile death under the Kim Jong Un regime since the execution of the leader's uncle Jang Song Thaek in December 2013. \nJong Nam, known as an advocate of reform in the North, once told a Japanese newspaper that he opposed his country's dynastic power transfers. \nHe was reportedly close to his uncle Jang Song Thaek, once the North's unofficial number two and political mentor of the current leader. \nHe has been targeted in the past. In October 2012, South Korean prosecutors said a North Korean detained as a spy had admitted involvement in a plot to stage a hit-and-run car accident in China in 2010 targeting Kim Jong Nam. \nIn 2014, Jong Nam was reported to be in Indonesia - sighted at an Italian restaurant run by a Japanese businessman in Jakarta - and was said to be shuttling back and forth between Indonesia, Malaysia and France. \nIn 2012 a Moscow newspaper reported that Jong Nam was having financial problems after being cut off by the Stalinist state for doubting its succession policy. \nThe Argumenty i Fakty weekly said he was kicked out of a luxury hotel in Macau over a US$15,000 debt. \nLast year, South Korea warned of possible North Korean assassination attempts on its territory. It noted previous attempts to assassinate Hwang Jang Yop, the North's chief ideologue and former tutor to Kim Jong Il, who defected to the South in 1997 and died of natural causes in 2010. - CNA/Agencies/rw/nc ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:36:14.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
