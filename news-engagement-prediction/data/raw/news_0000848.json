It's amazing that he's even a footballer to be honest. But he does clearly have some luck as he somehow stayed on the pitch against Spurs. \nRodwell has obviously been on the winning side before in his career but it's been so long since he started a game that his team won that he must almost forget what it's like to have done so. \nOf course playing for Sunderland doesn't help the former Everton midfielder with the North East side once again taking up their usual position near or in the relegation zone for the entirety of the season. \nHowever Rodwell did prove, in the first half of the Black Cats game against Spurs tonight, that, whilst he might not get a lot of luck when it comes to being on the winning team, he does have luck comes to staying on the pitch: Trying to work out how Rodwell hasn't been sent off for this? pic.twitter.com/aFQZq0uXq2 Rodwell is a lucky boy! Only booked for this - pic.twitter.com/PyY0XM71pP - Sports Punt (@Sports Punt) <a href=\" https://twitter.com/Sports Punt/status/826533557883564032\">January 31, 2017 \nIt doesn't look like the 25 year old could have any argument if he had been shown a straight red considering he wasn't anywhere near the ball. \nUnsurprisingly Spurs fans weren't happy with the decision: How on Earth did Rodwell not get a red card? That is utter :ox::poop: #COYS #TOTvSUN - Adam Richman (@AdamRichman) January 31, 2017 Rodwell should be off for that challenge. Defoe should also for telling the lino to F*ck off, in my opinion.Refs need to improve. - COYS News (@CoysNews) January 31, 2017 The replay of Rodwell's karate kick on Dembele being shown over and over. How it wasn't a red is anyone's guess. It gets worse every time. - John Cross (@johncrossmirror) January 31, 2017 Disgraceful tackle from Rodwell. For someone who knows what it's like to deal with major injuries there's absolutely no need for that. https://t.co/wjqB0i687u - Andrew Gaffney (@GaffneyVLC) January 31, 2017 Wow! How on earth is rodwell's tackle on dembele not a sending off. Scandalous! #FanLiveNG - 'niyi ajibade (@1yineda) January 31, 2017 @youaretheref Lee Mason 100% incorrect not to issue red for Rodwell but instead only issued yellow, how obvious do you want it seriously? - Luke Jack Conlaund (@ConlaundLuke) January 31, 2017 How on earth is rodwell still on the field?.. - Matt Clark (@MattJordann) January 31, 2017 Apart from the FUCKING BLATANT RED CARD FOR RODWELL, ref Lee Mason's done alright IMO.
