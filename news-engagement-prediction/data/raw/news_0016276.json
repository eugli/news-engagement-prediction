At least two policemen were injured in a pre-dawn militant attack on a police station in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan on Tuesday, a media report said. A militant crashed an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of Mandan Police Station in Bannu district causing an explosion, police said, Dawn news reported. As a result of the blast, two police officials performing duty at the gate were injured, while the main gate of the police station was damaged. The suspect, who was killed in the explosion, appeared to look around 21-year-old, according to police. The injured personnel were shifted to DHQ hospital. Security officials cordoned off the area and started to examine the site of the blast, for which there has been no immediate claim of responsibility.
