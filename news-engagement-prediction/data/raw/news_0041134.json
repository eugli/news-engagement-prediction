The actor was joined by her children at the world premiere of her passion project, First They Killed My Father in Siem Reap, Cambodia. hollywood Updated: Feb 18, 2017 21:24 IST AP Siem Reap, Cambodia Hollywood star Angelina Jolie greets media during a press conference at a hotel in Siem Reap on Saturday.(AFP) \nAngelina Jolie said Saturday that she hopes her new film about Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge will help educate the world about the brutality of the 1970s regime and shed a light on the plight of young people in war zones today. \nThe actor was joined by her children - Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, eight - at the world premiere of her passion project, First They Killed My Father in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Her sons Maddox, who was born in Cambodia, and Pax were both involved in the film’s production. The actor was joined by her children at the world premiere of her passion project, First They Killed My Father in Siem Reap, Cambodia. (AFP) \nFirst They Killed My Father is based on author and human rights activist Loung Ung’s account of her survival as a child under the 1975-79 communist Khmer Rouge regime, believed to be responsible for the deaths of 1.7 million Cambodians from starvation, disease and execution. \nSpeaking at a news conference ahead of the film’s premiere, the actor-turned-director said she hopes the movie will “remind everybody that there are little Loung’s all around the world today” in various war zones and corners of the world. Hollywood star Angelina Jolie speaks to media during a press conference at a hotel in Siem Reap. (AFP) \n“Her story is their story and so this is, in many ways, universal, and we hope that that is something that you think about as well,” said Jolie, who directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Loung. \nJolie has had an affinity for Cambodia since she began goodwill work for the UN’s refugee agency in 2001, and her eldest son, Maddox, 15, was adopted from the country. She also has established a foundation to promote social development in rural Cambodia.

Jolie said that Maddox is very proud of his Cambodian heritage and that she and her children see Cambodia as their “second home.” Angelina Jolie, center, stands with her group members as they wait before meeting Cambodia's King Norodom Sihamoni, in Siem Reap.

Maddox is happy to be back in his country.” \nThe film, a Netflix original production, will be shown on the streaming service later this year.
