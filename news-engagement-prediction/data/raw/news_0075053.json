We just saw a team fully committed.\n“I've been watching football for a long time and I don't think I've seen two teams who should come off the pitch holding their heads in shame.\n“Liverpool for how bad they were and Leicester for how bad their performances have been prior to this.”\nRanieri paid with his job for Leicester’s dismal Premier League title defence this season, but the sacking drew widespread criticism and condemnation given that the club was never expected to challenge for last season’s title, and that the Italian had brought the club more success in one season than in their entire history.\nLeicester 3 Liverpool 1: Player ratings 22 show all Leicester 3 Liverpool 1: Player ratings 1/22 Kasper Schmeichel 7/10 Made a series of good low saves. Could have done little to stop Liverpool's solitary goal.\nGetty Images\n2/22 Danny Simpson 7/10 Was unable to get forward as much as he would have liked but made an excellent first-half interception to prevent Coutinho from scoring.\nGetty Images\n3/22 Wes Morgan 7/10 Put in a performance that harked back to the Morgan of old. Did the simple stuff well and denied Firmino with a fine last-ditch tackle.\nGetty Images\n4/22 Robert Huth 6/10 Looked shaky when Mane isolated him in the penalty area early in the second-half. A threat going forward.\nGetty Images\n5/22 Christian Fuchs 6/10 Assisted Vardy's second goal with a sumptuous in-swinging cross. Had a couple of respectable shots from distance.\nAFP/Getty Images\n6/22 Marc Albrighton 8/10 Very impressive. His pass for the opening goal was a thing of beauty. Impish display out wide.\nCameraSport via Getty Images\n7/22 Danny Drinkwater 7/10 Grabbed his fair share of the headlines with a thunderous right-foot drive past Mignolet. Was occasionally guilty of dawdling on the ball, though.\nGetty Images\n8/22 Wilfred Ndidi 9/10 A contender for man of the match. Made 11 successful tackles: more than even N'Golo Kante ever managed in his time at the club.\nLiverpool FC via Getty Images\n9/22 Riyad Mahrez 7/10 Showed flashes of talent dribbling forward but, running at Milner and Lucas, he should have made more of an impact.\nGetty Images\n10/22 Shinji Okazaki 7/10 Played instead of Ahmed Musa; a tactical decision Craig Shakespeare got spot on. A typically combative performance, constantly freeing up space for Vardy to run into.\nGetty Images\n11/22 Jamie Vardy 9/10 The quintessential Jamie Vardy performance. Showed confidence in front of goal and terrorised Lucas with his direct running. Superb: man of the match.\nGetty Images\n12/22 Simon Mignolet 6/10 Cannot be blamed for any of the goals. Made two good first-half saves. Ran decisively off his line to twice deny Vardy late on.\nGetty Images\n13/22 Nathaniel Clyne 5/10 Should have done better for the third goal, which came down the right-hand side. Inexplicably performed a rabona while Liverpool were 3-1 down, which didn't go down all too well. \nGetty Images\n14/22 Joel Matip 5/10 A poor performance, but had it all to do in a defence lacking confidence and featuring players deployed out of position. \nGetty Images\n15/22 Lucas 3/10 Dreadful. Frequently exposed by Vardy. Struggled for the forward's pace and struggled in the air. Out of position and short of quality.\nGetty Images\n16/22 James Milner 4/10 Frequently caught out of position and struggled against the running of Mahrez and Vardy. Improved when shifted into midfield late on.\nGetty Images\n17/22 Emre Can 5/10 Liverpool badly missed Jordan Henderson. Can tried, but was often overran in midfield. Redeemed himself a little with a fine surge forward for Liverpool's consolation. \nGetty Images\n18/22 Georginio Wijnaldum 5/10 A poor performance from a player who has looked in form in recent weeks. Guilty of giving the ball away for Leicester's first goal. Offered nothing going forward.\nGetty Images\n19/22 Adam Lallana 5/10 Largely anonymous although did attempt to link up with Mane more in the second-half. That ultimately proved too little too late; hauled off by Klopp on the hour. \nGetty Images\n20/22 Philippe Coutinho 6/10 So far from his best. Took his goal very well but failed to capitalise on his half-chances in the first-half. \nLiverpool FC via Getty Images\n21/22 Sadio Mane 5/10 Chopped down by Jamie Vardy just 20 seconds into the match. Restricted to a role on the fringes thereafter and ultimately disappointing. \nGetty Images\n22/22 Roberto Firmino 5/10 Barely involved. The stats tell their own story: 0 shots on goal, 0 through balls played and just three aerials won. \nGetty Images\nThe fact that Ranieri was one of the most likeable managers in the Premier League strengthened the belief that he should have been given more time, and reports emerged over the weekend that the decision to sack him was taken after the Leicester owners met with a group of senior players following last week’s 2-1 Champions League defeat by Sevilla to communicate that the squad had lost faith with Ranieri.\nA more telling point came in the 24 hours after his dismissal, where not one Leicester player thanked Ranieri publicly or expressed sadness at his dismissal. Eventually, a number of player posted messages on social media, with both Kasper Schmeichel and Vardy denying having any part in the meeting with the owners or getting Ranieri sacked.\nVardy celebrates after scoring his first Premier League goal of 2017 ( Getty ) “Tonight is a bad result for traditionalists who think you should stick with their manager and a shot in the arm who think the change was right,” former Manchester United defender and England coach Gary Neville added.\nRead more Vardy hits back at critics for 'unfair stick' Shakespeare says 'there was fire in the belly' after hurtful criticism “My view is that Leicester were at it all night. I don't understand how you can switch a tap on and off.\n“Craig Shakespeare is not a magician and do all that in two and three days.\n“No coach can work or do anything in three days. That's the players who did that against a Liverpool side who allowed them to be exploit.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:52:13.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
