With Real still leading the league and Barca looking far from their best, he could make a huge contribution to the club's push for the title. Article continues below \nHowever, it would seem that not everyone is so happy to see him back on the pitch. \nShortly after the final whistle, a video began doing the rounds on social media showing the reaction of James Rodriguez as Bale readied himself to enter the fray.

While the pair have been at the club there has been no suggestion of a rift between Bale and Rodriguez, but with the Wales international now back to full fitness it could throw a shadow over James' future. \nThe Colombian had been linked with a move away earlier in the season, but his stint in the side seemed to quash the rumours of an imminent exit, but now we can likely expect the papers to get speculating once again. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
