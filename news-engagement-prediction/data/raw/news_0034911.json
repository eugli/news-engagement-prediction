Photo: Bosscat Kitchen & Libations Image 16 of 16 First look: Bosscat Kitchen & Libations 1 / 16 Back to Gallery Everything about Bosscat Kitchen & Libations appears grand.\nFor one, the space is huge – a burly, 6,900-square-foot food and drink emporium that can accommodate more than 220 anchored by a massive 30-seat bar.\nThe restaurant's clubby inner-sanctum Whiskey Room will house an enviable stash of more than 300 whiskey, bourbon and scotch selections with space for 40 private locker for VIPs to squirrel away their reserve riches. And when the patios are finished there will be an additional 40 seats on 2,000 square feet of outdoor space. Overall, it's a bold stamp on River Oaks.\nEven the ambitions of the restaurant's team are outsize. How else to explain the fact that the owners (based in Newport Beach, Calif., the home of the first Bosscat) moved to Houston six months ago to get their second store open? In fact the company moved nine people full time to Houston.\nThat's how much they believe in Bosscat . And in the Bayou City's potential as a growth market.\nRestaurant-goers will be able to see that level of commitment for themselves when Bosscat opens to the public on Feb. 22 at 4310 Westheimer at Mid Lane.\n\"We've always had a great affinity for the state of Texas,\" said co-owner John Reed, adding that Bosscat looked at Dallas, Austin and San Antonio before betting it all on Houston. \"The opportunity was far greater here.\"\nReed opened the first Bosscat in 2014 with his partners Leslie Nguyen (the restaurant gets its title from her nickname) and Vinnie Capizzi. All three relocated to Houston as well as executive chef Peter Petro and bar director Matt Sharp. The Bosscat operations are, effectively, now run from Houston.\nThe partners, even after half a year in Houston, remain astonished at the city's friendliness, diversity and camaraderie within the food community.\n\"People here are a lot more engaging and inquisitive, and a lot more involved in the community,\" Nguyen said.\n\"And their appetite is so much more diverse,\" Reed said, adding: \"I couldn't believe how neighborly the chefs are. All the chefs and restaurant owners we've met here are so gracious.\"\nDuring more than a dozen trips to Houston (made before they physically moved here) the partners ate their way through the city. They hit a lot of restaurants to get the culinary lay of the land, including State of Grace, Underbelly, Pax Americana, B&B Butchers & Restaurant, Revival Market, Coltivare, Roost, Ritual and casual neighborhood joints such as The Breakfast Klub, Bernie's Burger Bus, Stanton's City Bites and Lankford Grocery.\n\"Houston has a very different way of eating,\" said chef Petro.\nHis menu, while almost unchanged from the original Bosscat menu he created in California, appears to be built for Houston tastebuds. Shareable appetizers include pork belly poutine; bourbon chicken flatbread; pulled pork hush puppies; cornbread Madeleines; and crispy buttermilk fried frog's legs. Two new additions were made to the starters lineup: pimento cheese presented with toasted bread and vegetables, and \"pig candy,\" pork lacquered with rye whiskey caramel.\nSandwich options include the Bosscat Burger, barbecue porchetta sandwich, a Kentucky Hot Brown (open-face roasted turkey sandwich topped with mornay sauce), black-eyed pea sandwich (deep-fried black-eyed pea fritters), and a Cuban sandwich riff called the Bosscat Press made with barbecue pulled pork. Main dish options include Gulf shrimp and grits; 12-hour braised beef short rib with potato gratin; Cajun brick chicken with Charleston gold heirloom dirty rice; barbecue salmon with butter bean succotash; and an all-day breakfast option of a skillet pancake topped with a duck fat fried egg, bacon, and whiskey maple syrup.\n\"We're not trying to reinvent the wheel. I just want to make good food people enjoy,\" Petro said. \"I know we have a place here and hopefully we'll stand out.\"\nThe menu is brief but packs a punch; created to marry well with whiskey pours and house libations including the Bosscat (Basil Hayden's, citrus, bitters and rosemary), 38 Special (Bulleit Bourbon, Aperol, Averna and citrus), and Kentucky Orange Blossom (Buffalo Trace, elderflower liqueur and citrus). The bar also will serve batched barrel-aged cocktails from an in-house barrel-aging program under Sharp's supervision.\nOverall, the beefy décor is handsomely inviting with a moneyed post-frat boy look (think of an established energy exec who thinks nothing of spending $30 on a shot of whiskey). Exposed brick and reclaimed wood dominate, broken up by metal chairs and bar stools, banquettes of tufted black leather, stained concrete floors, and antiqued dining hall lamps. Design bonus: There are enormous garage-door windows that can roll up in good weather.\nReed isn't necessarily anxious about the restaurant opening. After all, they've been working on the project since last summer.\n\"The nerves are gone,\" he said. \"Now we're just ready to make a splash.\"\nMost likely in a very big way.\nBosscat Kitchen & Libations, 4310 Westheimer, 281-501-1187; bosscatkitchen.com.
