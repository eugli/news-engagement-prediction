I will tirelessly advocate for you and the work you do and commit to you that I will remain at the EAA until June 30.\" \nShe said she has \"absolutely loved my time here. Despite feeling like we did not have enough time together, I know one thing for sure: together, we have made a lasting impact on thousands of children.\" \nIn her letter, Conforme cited improved results on the Michigan Student Test of Educational Progress, noting that on average schools saw more improvement than the statewide average. \nContact Lori Higgins: 313-222-6651, lhiggins@freepress.com or @LoriAHiggins  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:54:28.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
