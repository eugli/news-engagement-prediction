Why is Brendon Grylls targeting BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, and how will the WA Nationals make it work? \n\"The West Australian Nationals with the new special lease rental can really drive investment into that sector,\" Mr Grylls said. \n\"The fund would enable WA to lead the nation in tourism product development, marketing and world-class Indigenous tourism experiences.\" \nMr Grylls also said the Premier had promised to preference the Nationals first, and his party would do the same for their alliance partners in government. \nMeanwhile, despite prediction of big gains for Pauline Hanson's One Nation, Mr Grylls said the Nationals had \"nothing to fear\" from the party. \nHe said One Nation had delivered nothing for voters the last time it had elected MPs in WA.
