(Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images for American Magazi)   \nThird time’s a charm? \nFormer Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson, who settled a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against former Fox News chief Roger Ailes last year, is reportedly in talks to join MSNBC, Business Insider writes . \nCarlson wouldn’t be the first to join the left-leaning cable news network, after Greta Van Susteren made the same move earlier this year. MSNBC's @Greta Van Susteren Tells President Trump to 'Back Off' Media — Watch https://t.co/LohrvmbBr8 pic.twitter.com/DDg1ArjNTI \nBusiness Insider cites sources familiar with the matter and writes that Carlson’s deal “had not yet been finalized, but was nearing completion.” \nThe site notes that the story had been corroborated by two other sources at the network. Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson settled a reported $20 million lawsuit against the former CEO and Chairman of Fox News, Roger Ailes (shown, right), for sexual harassment and retaliation. (Andrew Toth) \nA MSNBC spokesperson informed Business Insider that Carlson had not yet made the switch, but did not comment on whether talks between parties were ongoing. \nFollowing publication of the site’s report, the MSNBC spokesperson denied there were talks between Carlson and the network. \nIn September 2016, Carlson, 50, settled a reported $20 million suit against Ailes, suggesting that her exit from Fox News came about because she refused Ailes’ sexual advances. \nAiles, 76, stepped down from his role at Fox News in July 2016. He had helmed the network since its inaugural year in 1996. He also advised Donald Trump in his presidential bid, assisting with debate prep for the Republican candidate. \nIf the talks prove to be real, Carlson would be the third former anchor from Fox to join an NBC network. Aside from Van Susteren, Megyn Kelly also signed on to NBC News to join a morning program, create her own Sunday news show and take part in NBC’s major political coverage.
