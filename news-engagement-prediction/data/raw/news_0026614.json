The Washington Examiner reports that all but three of these cities are “sanctuary cities,” or cities with policies that shelter illegal immigrants. \nInteresting numbers. \nDo you live in one of these cities? \nClearly, this is something that needs to be addressed and it’s baffling that the liberal media pretends otherwise.
