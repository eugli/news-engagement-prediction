According to Forbes , which first reported the case, the warrant was executed. \nNow, a federal judge in Illinois has denied a similar request, saying that the warrant application does not establish sufficient probable cause to force anyone at the premises to give up their fingerprint, and that it raises serious concerns under the Fifth Amendment's protection against compelled self-incrimination. As Orin Kerr has pointed out in The Washington Post , by responding to an order by picking the finger that was selected to unlock the phone, the person is actually admitting that it is their phone. \nThe new document signals a developing trend in the drafting of so-called mass fingerprint warrants. \n\"Essentially, the government seeks an order from this Court that would allow agents executing this warrant to force 'persons at the Subject Premises' to apply their thumbprints and fingerprints to any Apple electronic device recovered at the premises,\" the opinion and order signed by United States Magistrate Judge M. David Weisman from the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, reads. \nRiana Pfefferkorn, a cryptography fellow at Stanford Center for Internet and Society, shared the document on Twitter on Wednesday. \n\"The request is neither limited to a particular person nor a particular device,\" the order continues. According to the order, the case revolves around a perhaps still developing child pornography investigation. \nRather stunningly, the warrant application does not actually specify what specific devices located at the premises are to be searched; it only says \"it is likely\" Apple devices will be found at the residence, according to the order. \nThat doesn't mean that these sort of warrants may always fail, writes Judge Weisman, such as in cases where an individual is shown to have a more firm connection to criminal conduct. \n\"We simply are not there yet,\" Judge Weisman writes. \nThe Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:15:47.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
