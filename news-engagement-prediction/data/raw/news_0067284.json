Some have invested heavily in new technologies and would prefer to have the standards continue to rise, albeit more modestly, to help ensure a market for their advanced vehicles. Honda, Hyundai and Toyota are planning a range of hybrids, electric vehicles and cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells to sell within a few years. Others, such as Fiat Chrysler, have a lineup heavy on trucks and S.U.V.s and would be better off with a significant rollback in fuel-economy requirements. The letters from the manufacturer lobbying groups represent the latest push by carmakers for a reprieve from the emissions and fuel-economy standards. This month, 18 auto-company chief executives wrote a letter to Mr. Trump on the same issue. \nAdvertisement   During the presidential campaign, on Twitter and in campaign stops, Mr. Trump heavily criticized automakers, especially Ford, for investing in Mexico. He has also threatened to impose a border tax on imports from Mexico, where many cars sold in the American market are made, especially smaller, less profitable models. But after the election, the president and automakers became more closely aligned. Ford won praise from Mr. Trump after it announced it was cance ling plans to build a new plant in Mexico. Other automakers have also announced plans to add jobs and invest in the United States. In January, Mr. Trump met with the chief executives of Ford, G.M. and Fiat Chrysler at the White House and encouraged them to add jobs in the United States in exchange for more favorable regulatory and tax policies. Mr. Pruitt, the administrator of the E.P.A., is most likely predisposed to listen to automakers’ concerns about fuel-economy targets. While Oklahoma’s attorney general, Mr. Pruitt frequently sued the E.P.A. and worked closely with oil and gas companies fighting the agency’s regulations. The auto lobbying groups asked Mr. Pruitt to reopen a review of the 2025 fuel-economy targets that had been expected to last until early 2018. That review was cut short on Jan. 13 — seven days before Mr. Trump was inaugurated — when the outgoing administrator, Gina McCarthy, issued a “final determination” that the targets should remain in place. Even if Mr. Pruitt reopens the review and ultimately sides with the industry, automakers will need to continue spending to develop fuel-saving technologies, given the mileage or emissions requirements in many states, as well as Europe and China, that manufacturers will have to meet. Those standards continue to get tougher. “The rest of the world is still pressing ahead with higher standards,” said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader.com . “Even if they ease regulation in the U.S., companies will still have to do this to be compliant in other markets.” A version of this article appears in print on February 23, 2017, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Automakers Push E.P.A. to Ease Fuel-Efficiency Standards Developed Under Obama.
