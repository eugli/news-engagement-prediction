Source: Channel 10 \n“So Tiffany and Megan are faking their relationship?” one person asked in the video comment section. \n“Yes they are faking their relationship,” Maguire replied. \nIt’s a big claim: if Maguire is right, the couple has certainly committed to their “stunt,” having just moved to Bali together.
