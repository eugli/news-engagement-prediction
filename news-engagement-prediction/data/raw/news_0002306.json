Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports Feb 1, 2017 at 10:35a ET 0Shares \nThe flip of the calendar to February means we’re just a couple of weeks away from pitchers and catchers reporting to spring training. And Mets ace Noah Syndergaard is excited as anyone. \nSyndergaard led New York’s injury-battered rotation in ERA (2.60), WHIP (1.15), FIP (2.29) and strikeouts (218) last season. However, as one of the game’s best-hitting hurlers (three homers, three doubles in 2016), Syndergaard is perhaps more eager to take a few hacks with his new bats: My bats came in for Spring Training today. Got one specially made for @MrMet . Anyone seen him around? #lucillerakes pic.twitter.com/Odknk8unMT \n— Noah Syndergaard (@Noahsyndergaard) February 1, 2017 \nFans of “The Walking Dead” will recognize that as the Lucille model – made famous by the notorious Negan. And it remains to be seen how Thor – who apparently has put Mjolnir on the back burner – will sneak that customized Louisville Slugger past home-plate umpires. \nApparently, Syndergaard is hoping to put the finishing touches on his long-running feud with mascot Mr. Met. Our advice for Mr. Met: Try to beat Syndergaard to the equipment truck when it arrives in Port St. Lucie, Florida, and then hide.
