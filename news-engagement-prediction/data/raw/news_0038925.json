They stress that powerful opioid painkillers -- such as OxyContin and Vicodin -- should be used only as a last resort in some cases of long-lasting back pain .\nAnother change: When medication is needed, acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) is no longer recommended.\nRecent research has shown it's not effective for low back pain, said Dr. Nitin Damle, president of the ACP.\nThe good news, according to Damle, is that most people with shorter-term \"nonspecific\" low back pain improve with simple measures like heat and changes in activity.\nNonspecific pain , Damle explained, is the kind where your back hurts and \"you're not sure what you did to it.\"\nHe said that's different from \"radicular\" back pain , which is caused by compression of a spinal nerve -- from a herniated disc , for example. Typically, this problem has telltale symptoms like pain that radiates down the leg, or weakness or numbness in the leg.\nIn general, the ACP said, people with low back pain should first try nondrug options.\nFor pain that has lasted fewer than 12 weeks, research suggests heat wraps, massage , acupuncture and spinal manipulation may ease pain and restore function to a moderate degree, according to the guidelines.\nIf the pain lasts more than 12 weeks, studies suggest some drug-free options can still be helpful, the ACP said.\nThose include exercise therapy; acupuncture ; \"mind-body\" therapies like yoga , tai chi , mindfulness-based stress reduction and guided relaxation techniques; and cognitive behavioral therapy.\nWhen medication is used, the ACP advises starting with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) such as ibuprofen ( Advil , Motrin ) and naproxen ( Aleve ) -- or possibly muscle relaxants.\nIf that fails, and pain persists, the next options might include duloxetine ( Cymbalta ) -- which is prescribed for both depression and nerve pain . Or the painkiller tramadol , which is a narcotic, but it can relieve pain and affect function in the short term, according to the guidelines.", "external_links": ["http://xml.apache.org/xalan"], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:54:26.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
