'The kids didn't find out what we were doing until right at the last minute, so I think it was a bit of a shock for them. 'I think my girls were a bit embarrassed at first, but deep down they were quite proud - they asked me a lot of questions on the way home about how long I'd been practising, and said I was actually quite good!' Dedication: The 13 dads took part in 12 weeks of rehearsals before the show, spending every Monday night practising their moves until they had perfected the routine. Paul added: 'At the end of the day it's just a bunch of dads having a laugh and not taking themselves too seriously. We had an enormous amount of fun, and it was done in very good spirit.' The 13 dads took part in 12 weeks of rehearsals before the show, spending every Monday night practising their moves until they had perfected the routine. Paul added: 'I've never done anything like it before, and it was quite a special feeling when the curtain went up. We were all very nervous before, but once the music started we really got into it. Some of the dancing dads and teachers dressed as builders during the show, while others wore heels and hotpants in the parody of the 2015 Money Supermarket advert 'We didn't know about the costumes at the start - the wardrobe department have a lot to answer for - but we just rolled with it. 'Initially we found the routine quite difficult - during the first few weeks of rehearsals I thought, \"Christ, I can't do this\" - but it all started to come together about two weeks before the show.' The dads were so popular that they now have their own spin-off Facebook page, Freedom Dance Dads, where they have been inundated with messages from fans. The dancing dads getting ready before the show. Their dodgy dad dancing stole the show as they twerked and twirled in tight denim shorts and red stilettos in their surprise routine THE MOST HATED ADVERT OF 2015 The routine took inspiration from the 2015 'So MoneySuperMarket' campaign MoneySuperMarket.com's TV advert of a man walking down a street and dancing while wearing denim shorts and heels shoes received twice as many complaints as its rivals in 2015, according to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). Some 1,513 complaints were filed against the ad, with many viewers citing the man's clothing and dance moves and its 'overtly sexual' content as reasons. Critics argued it was 'overtly sexual', 'distasteful' and 'offensive. However, the ASA said most people would accept the tongue in cheek humour. Freedom Dance principal Stacey Green said: 'They were really nervous, but wanted to do it for the kids - they were all really good sports, and they were amazing. Everyone is talking about the dads!' The routine which the dads took inspiration from was part of the money-saving website's 'So MoneySuperMarket' campaign. It started with the 'Epic Strut' advert in 2015, and was followed by others including the 'Dave v Colin dance-off', and a bodyguard showing some old-school dance moves.
