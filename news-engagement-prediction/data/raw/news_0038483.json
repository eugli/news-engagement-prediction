The Bloomberg report shows Musk has made progress on bringing his idea to fruition. \nMusk has acquired the domain name BoringCompany.com and appointed Steve Davis, a senior SpaceX engineer, as leader of the project. He said the tunnel venture will be an independent company from Tesla and SpaceX. \nExciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 25, 2017 \nMusk has started digging a pit at the SpaceX parking lot as a \"demo tunnel\" that can accommodate cars and serve as the basis of an underground transportation network. Shane Yanagisawa, an engineer with 25 years of tunnel experience according to his LinkedIn , is the project manager for the demo tunnel. \nAlthough Musk doesn't need permits to dig on SpaceX's campus, he is in the process of acquiring permits to eventually expand the tunnel beyond the SpaceX property line. \nMusk said he plans to build an underground network that includes 30 levels of tunnels for cars and high-speed trains like the Hyperloop, according to the Bloomberg report.
