(this was) a tragedy without precedent in the history of Angolan football.\"\nCrowd control\nSome witnesses said many fans did not have tickets to the match, while other reports said that spectators inside the stadium were not aware of the stampede until it was over.\nAngola, ranked 148 in the FIFA world rankings, is a minor power in African football.\nThe country has been relatively closed to the outside world under the authoritarian President Jose Eduardo dos Santos who has ruled since 1979.\nFootball has a tragic history of stampedes and stadium deaths, often blamed on lack of crowd control, dangerous venues and spectator behaviour.\nIn 2009, poor crowd control in Abidjan caused 19 deaths before a 2010 World Cup qualifier between hosts Ivory Coast and Malawi.\nA stampede at the Accra Sports Stadium in Ghana in 2001 resulted in 127 deaths.\nAt that game, supporters angered by their team's defeat threw projectiles and broke chairs. Police threw tear-gas grenades, triggering a stampede.\nIn May 1964, 320 people were killed and more than 1,000 injured during a stampede at a Peru-Argentina match at Lima's National Stadium. Fans could not escape the crush and were trampled or asphyxiated.\nBritain renovated its football grounds after 56 people died in a fire in a wooden stand in 1985 and 96 Liverpool supporters died in a crush during an FA Cup semi-final in 1989.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/Africa/Articles&sz=600x50&c=605792318&t=artid%3d780dc2bc-6140-44f5-8426-46f634983d5c%26Places%3dangola%26Topics%3dsouthern+africa%26accreditation%3dafp%26posno%3d1", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/Africa/Articles&sz=600x50&c=605792318&t=artid%3d780dc2bc-6140-44f5-8426-46f634983d5c%26Places%3dangola%26Topics%3dsouthern+africa%26accreditation%3dafp%26posno%3d1"], "published": "2017-02-11T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T12:19:01.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
