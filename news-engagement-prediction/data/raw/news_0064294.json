The order builds on previous directives to find two regulations to cut for every new one proposed, and to freeze pending regulations. \nWhile the latest measure takes this a step further, stripping existing regulations could ultimately require congressional involvement. \nTrump's new order calls for each task force to document and report their progress toward meeting the president’s directives. \nIn the first 30 days of his term, Trump has overseen a considerable slowdown in regulations, according to an analysis by The Hill. There has been a 72 percent decline in regulatory activity during the first month of the Trump administration compared with the last two months of then-President Barack Obama’s term. \nTrump also has signed several bills passed by Congress aimed at specific regulations. They include a resolution to mitigate the harm done to the coal industry by the Stream Protection Rule, and another measure to eliminate a reporting regulation that Republicans argue placed American mining and energy companies and their employees at an unfair disadvantage because their foreign competitors do not have similar requirements. \nAccording to the White House, the Obama administration finalized more than 3,000 regulations that cost American taxpayers $873 billion. \nSpeaking Thursday at the annual CPAC, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus characterized Trump’s regulatory reform efforts as a “big deal.” \nBannon echoed Priebus, saying the earlier executive action was the first step towards the \"deconstruction of the administrative state.\" \nNot everyone is on board Trump’s regulatory reform train. \nOn February 8, Public Citizen, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Communications Workers of America jointly filed a l awsuit challenging the validity of the action calling for two regulations to be stripped for every one proposed. \nThe three liberal groups argue that complying with the executive order would force government agencies to violate the 1946 Administrative Procedures Act, the federal statute which governs the way regulations are established.
