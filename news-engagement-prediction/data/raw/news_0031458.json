Its model number is SM-T820, which has surfaced numerous times as being the Galaxy Tab S3 (with the SM-T825 being the 4G LTE model). With the FCC having approved the device, its next step is to be announced and then released. It’s unclear how much the Galaxy Tab S3 is going to cost when it’s officially launched, but it’ll likely be around the same price as the Galaxy Tab S2 when it was released almost two years ago. \nSamsung is holding a press conference at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain later this month, and the company has already confirmed that the Galaxy S8 (and to that note the Galaxy S8 Plus) will not be at the trade show this year. The invite also appears to show a tablet, which leads many to be the Galaxy Tab S3, especially with the number of rumors that have been surfacing of the tablet as of late.This would be Samsung’s first tablet announced in more than a year, which isn’t surprising given how unpopular the tablet market has become lately. \nThe tablet is rumored to be sporting a curved display , much like the Galaxy S7 Edge that the company debuted last year at Mobile World Congress. This has a lot of people excited about this tablet, on top of that, it’s likely going to include a S Pen. It seems as if Samsung is bringing the S Pen to just about everything lately. Seeing as the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro also use a stylus – although Samsung won’t call it the S Pen. And now the Galaxy Tab S3 is getting it too. Which is actually a pretty good idea, with many people using tablets for all kinds of multi-tasking things, which a stylus would come in handy for. The Galaxy Tab S3 should be available in two screen sizes and with a 4:3 aspect ratio, a size that many manufacturers have been going towards lately.
