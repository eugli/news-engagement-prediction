George and Matt shared the cigarette \nThe Sun Online has contacted both stars’ reps for comment. \nThe group took to the stage to perform their hit song The Sound after winning the British Group gong earlier in the evening. ITV The 1975 performed at The BRITs on Wednesday night, but viewers thought they had been hacked ITV 19 A minute and a half into the performance, pink screens with writing on criticising the band appeared \nBut almost a minute and a half into the track, a pink screen with the words ‘Is this a joke?’ appeared, before quickly going back to the group’s performance. \nHowever seconds later, the pink screen was back with the words ‘Do people really still make music like this?’ before being followed by other posts including statements like, ‘There’s no danger in this music at all’ and ‘This band thinks it has a charismatic singer…’ \nThe interruptions lead many viewers to suspect foul play and that someone had hacked into the broadcast to post the messages. ITV Lead singer Matt Healy put on a quirky performance Twitter But some viewers thought the band’s performance had been hacked Twitter Many were confused by the footage Twitter 19 Twitter users didn’t know what was going on \nTaking to Twitter, one viewer wrote alongside a screen grab of their TV: “Someone’s been hacked” with lots of crying with laughter emojis. \nAnother added: “Has someone hacked the tv whilst the 1975 are playing or something??” \nA third also thought the band were on the receiving end of a cruel prank as they wrote: “Is this a part of #1975 act or has someone hacked the #BRITs”.
