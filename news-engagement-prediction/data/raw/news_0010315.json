It erased her own previous mark of 6,810.\nTwo Japanese – Saaya Hirosawa (3,620pts) and Kazumi Inoue (3,370pts) took silver and bronze in the Asian category.\nThis win proves that Aaliyah has learned her lesson after starting the year by missing the cut for the final of the World Junior Championships in Santiago, Chile, last month.\nThen, the Singapore SEA Games double gold medallist took an early fall and only scored 2,560 to finish in 35th spot.\n“My failure in Chile was definitely a bummer, but I’ve learned to be more relaxed. I’m back on track in the tricks here,” said Aaliyah\n“I didn’t do too well in the slalom preliminaries here ... didn’t make the final, but I more than made up for it with my results in tricks.\n“I also managed a new personal best in jump (27.9m) and that’s great because I haven’t made any new marks in a while.”\nAaliyah’s 11-year-old brother Aiden also did well by grabbing silver in the Under-17 category of the Asian Championships.\nAiden scored 2,720 points to finish behind Indonesia’s Diams Ridho Suprihono (3,180pts).\nNine-year-old Adam, the youngest of the Hanifah siblings, just missed out on a medal after scoring 2,230 points to finish fourth behind South Korea’s Ju Seong-min (2,560pts).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:25:43.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
