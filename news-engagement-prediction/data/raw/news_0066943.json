After almost 11 years, praying day and night, month after month, year after year for this day to come.” \nThe court heard police had conducted an undercover operation to follow Redelback in the days and months after her body was found. Redelback told undercover officer he put Degayo's body in a garbage bag then into a suitcase in trunk of car, then drove out for a beer. \n— Jayme Doll (@DollJayme) February 23, 2017 \nAfter the case wrapped up in court, Degayo’s sister, Riza Fornier, spoke to Global News outside the courthouse. \n“This is the moment we’ve been waiting for.
