Well, when you have stars like Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi on board, the movie is bound to be exciting. It is everything we expected it to be – powerful, edgy, racy and fast-paced. Except for Thani Oruvan, there haven’t been many films where the hero and antagonist have played equally powerful roles. And now we have Vikram Veda, where the hero and the antagonist share equal, powerful on screen space. Madhavan as the cop is fearless, head strong and determined, but it’s Vijay Sethupathi who steals the limelight. His body language, his physical characteristics and his presence on screen emanates a sense of authority of who is boss. He is not the easiest of villains to nab and knows exactly what he is doing. This is not going to be an easy game for Madhavan to finish. Music by Sam CS deserves a special mention, as it adds to the cop-gangsta drama. The movie is reportedly a modern take on the mythological tale of Vikramaditya. The movie is all set to release this summer. We can’t wait! The first look itself created quite a furore, wonder what kind of reactions will the teaser garner?

Fans were super excited back then, now we are sure they are psyched about this collaboration after watching this teaser. \nSo how did you like the Vikram Veda teaser? Which is your favourite moment? We love the last scene where they face ecah toher, pointing revolvers at the other. In a way it indicates both characters are powerful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T13:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:10:21.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
