She and colleagues used the Hubble Space Telescope to learn that the exoplanets, known as TRAPPIST-1b and TRAPPIST-1c, were unlikely to have \"puffy, hydrogen-dominated atmospheres\" found on gaseous planets â€” a characteristic Lewis said \"increases the chances for habitability on these planets.\" \nNASA officials called the research \"a promising first step\" in learning whether the planets could be rocky and habitable like Earth. \nThe Space Telescope institute is responsible for managing the Hubble and its scientific pursuits. The Hubble launched in 1990 and has produced observations used in more than 14,000 scientific papers.
