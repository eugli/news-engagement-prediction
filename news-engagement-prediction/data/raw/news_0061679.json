I'll warn you before you click \"play\" on that trailer that it may overwhelm you with righteous indignation. Just who does Horizon think it is, making our post-apocalyptic world look so goddamn beautiful? Does it think Earth would be better off without humans or something? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY, HORIZON?! \nHere are some of the most egregious offenders. A bit miffed about that elegantly dilapidated tower Oh come on aurora borealis is just cheating So are misty waterfalls, honestly I thought I could trust you, picturesque desert bluff Even when it's on fire it still looks nice?! \nThe gall! The absolute nerve! Well, there's no other choice - we'll just have to keep the camera pointed down at the ground the whole time we play Horizon: Zero Dawn. Don't give it the satisfaction of admiring those breathtaking vistas. \nSeen something newsworthy?
