She sighs and shakes her head.\nThey often lack \"the fundamental stuff\" — arriving on time, ironing their shirts, communicating well, taking direction...\n(Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz) Only about 40 percent of CPS graduates go to a four-year college — and just less than half of those in college graduate within six years — so many seek employment or other training.\nBut employment prospects for Chicago youth have been bleak. Among CPS graduates with the lowest qualifications, 37 percent were neither working nor in college in the fall after high school graduation, according to a 2013 report from the University of Chicago's Consortium on School Research.\nUnemployment is particularly stubborn among black youth living in highly segregated communities on the South and West sides that also have been the scene of much of Chicago's violence.\nAmong black youth, 13 percent of 16- to 19-year-olds and 39 percent of 20- to 24-year-olds were not working and not going to school in 2015; that compared with 9 percent of teens and 22 percent of early 20-somethings in the city overall, according to a report released last month by the Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois at Chicago .\n\"To me, this population of young people is the one that's problematic in our society today,\" said Jakki Dace, senior partnership development liaison for the CPS Careers and Technical Education program.\nSchurz High School Jim Young / Chicago Tribune Yolobe co-founder David Douglas, right, works with Schurz High School students Angel Pagan, center, and Luis Baca on Feb. 17, 2017, as part of a pilot program to test the Yolobe youth job app at the high school.

(Jim Young / Chicago Tribune) Dace sees promise in Yolobe as a way to reconnect the city's \"disconnected\" youth and help employers eager to recruit recent high school graduates.\nEmployers such as ComEd, People's Gas and Sodexo, plus numerous workforce training providers and unions with apprenticeship programs, come to Dace with varied entry-level opportunities, but disseminating the information to youth is time-consuming and difficult, she said. Many students don't read their email, and the school district often loses contact with them once they graduate.\n\"Yolobe provides a place for these organizations to post easily and update easily\" in a technological format young people gravitate to, Dace said. While Yolobe doesn't have a formal relationship with CPS, Dace plans to inform guidance counselors and career coaches at all CPS schools this spring about Yolobe so they can encourage their students to use it.\nYolobe, available as a smartphone app and on the Web, currently is focused on new high school graduates but plans to serve youth aged 13 to 24, said Douglas, who co-founded the startup with Chief Technology Officer Jason Lambert. The app, a for-profit social venture, is free for users but may eventually charge for premium services.\nThe tool allows youth to create profiles listing their skills and interests, which Douglas said is more useful than a traditional resume for people in that age group with minimal work experience.\nYouth unemployment stings south suburbs far worse than north Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz Disturbing unemployment trends among Chicago youth are mirrored in some Cook County suburbs, including a stark north-south divide.\nNearly 40 percent of black 20- to 24-year-olds were both out of school and out of work in Cook County in 2014, compared with 15 percent of Hispanics and 8 percent of...\nDisturbing unemployment trends among Chicago youth are mirrored in some Cook County suburbs, including a stark north-south divide.\nNearly 40 percent of black 20- to 24-year-olds were both out of school and out of work in Cook County in 2014, compared with 15 percent of Hispanics and 8 percent of...\n(Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz) Employers, schools, churches, workforce development agencies and other organizations with jobs or opportunities to post also create profiles, and the individual youth users can choose to connect with those they find interesting.\nJob postings and other news from those \"networks\" show up on the youth's news feed, similar to Facebook. There is a verification process for the networks to ensure youth safety.\nYolobe's initial goal is for 20 percent of the graduating population to sign up, and for 60 percent of those to still be engaged with the app a year out, Douglas said.\nTom Peters, director of workforce development at Symbol Training Institute, an Addison-based provider of advanced manufacturing training, has registered on Yolobe in hopes of reaching young people more easily.\nHosting students on field trips, or traveling to schools to present to classrooms, as he does now, takes a lot of time and doesn't reach nearly as many students as he would like.\n\"The hardest thing is trying to get the message out to them,\" Peters said.\nAnd it's hard for young people to know what they're missing.\nIn prepping youth for corporate America, nonprofit highlights the power of pretend Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz Dawn Harris was known as the quietest of her nine siblings.

Yolobe, she added, \"has the potential to be transformative for our students.\"\nDusaan Allen, 17, a senior at Schurz, thinks so as well. He interned at Yolobe last summer and made the case for his school to partner with the startup.\n\"Sometimes kids be shy,\" said Allen, who lives in the Washington Park neighborhood on the South Side. \"So if we have an app that's just like Facebook, Instagram, then it's easier to use.\"\naelejalderuiz@chicagotribune.com\nTwitter @alexiaer\n High Schools Unemployment and Layoffs Chicago Public Schools University of Illinois at Chicago", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-567463f8/turbine/ct-youth-unemployment-soft-skills-gap-1221-biz-20151218", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56f15b0a/turbine/ct-youth-unemployment-cook-county-suburbs-0323-biz-20160322", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-57c8a72e/turbine/ct-youth-unemployment-chicago-neighborhood-0904-biz-20160527", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58adfed8/turbine/ct-yolobe-jpg-20170222", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58adfed8/turbine/ct-yolobe-youth-unemployment-0223-biz-20170222"], "published": "2017-02-22T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:30:11.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
