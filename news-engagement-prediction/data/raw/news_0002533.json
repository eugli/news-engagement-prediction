Bush and confirmed by a Democratic-controlled Senate in 1991.\nThe Senate’s Republican leaders have kept Scalia’s seat vacant since his death last February, refusing to hold hearings on President Obama’s nomination of federal appeals court Judge Merrick Garland to replace the court’s most outspoken conservative. \nTheir blockade paid political dividends with the election of Trump, who promised to appoint a justice in Scalia’s mold and one who would vote to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, and protect the rights of gun owners.\nAn immediate reversal of Roe is unlikely, as five of the current justices have previously voted to uphold abortion rights. The ruling would be at stake if a second vacancy arose, with the departure of one of the court’s senior justices such as Ruth Bader Ginsburg , 83, Anthony Kennedy , 80, or Stephen Breyer , 78.\nBut the new nominee could provide the deciding vote on other important issues. In one case, in which the court deadlocked 4-4 last year, a fifth conservative vote could prohibit unions of teachers and other government employees in California and 22 other states from charging fees to nonmembers for the costs of representing them at the bargaining table, a critical source of union funding.\nAnother case awaiting possible Supreme Court review is a challenge to the California law requiring a permit, seldom granted in urban areas, to carry a concealed handgun in public. Scalia’s 2008 ruling declared a constitutional right to possess guns in the home for self-defense, but the court has not said whether the same rights apply outside the home.\nThe high court is also likely to have the last word on the legality of Trump’s executive order halting the entry of refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\nGorsuch is the son of the late Anne Gorsuch Burford , who headed the Environmental Protection Agency under President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1983. After graduating from Harvard Law School, he was a law clerk for several judges, including Justice Kennedy, then spent a decade practicing law in Washington, D.C., before his judicial appointment by President George W. Bush to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006.\nTrump’s nominee has never ruled on an abortion case. But he appeared to signal his position, evidently to the satisfaction of Trump and evangelical groups, in cases involving religious objections to birth control.\nHe voted with the appeals court majority in 2013 to allow the arts-and-crafts chain Hobby Lobby and other corporations run by religious conservatives to refuse to cover female employees’ use of contraceptives that the owners considered similar to abortion, a ruling the Supreme Court upheld in 2014. Gorsuch wrote a separate opinion saying the corporate owners should be allowed to sue on their own to avoid taking part in “what their religion teaches them to be a moral wrong.”\nIn a dissenting opinion in 2015, Gorsuch supported a Catholic nonprofit’s claim that its religious rights would be violated by having to sign a form stating its objection to contraceptive coverage, thus allowing an insurer to provide the coverage. The Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 on that issue.\nHe also voted in dissent to allow the display of a Ten Commandments monument in a public park and a roadside cross commemorating a highway patrolman. But Gorsuch has been willing to invoke religious freedom on the liberal side — a trait shared by Scalia — in a 2014 ruling reinstating a suit by an American Indian, serving a life sentence for murder, who sought access to a prison sweat lodge for spiritual ceremonies and prayer.\nGorsuch “has a well-thought-out conception of constitutional interpretation and the way that structure protects liberty,” said attorney Ilye Shapiro of the conservative-libertarian Cato Institute . “He’s most known for his opinions supporting religious liberty and pushing back on the administrative state.”\nLike Scalia, Gorsuch is an avowed “originalist” who says he rules according to the text of the Constitution and statutes, as originally written and intended, without regard to legislators’ stated intentions or subsequent changes in national values. In an article in the conservative National Review Online in 2005, a year before becoming a judge, he said courts should have little say in determining public policy.\n“American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private=school education,” Gorsuch wrote. Such an approach, he said, “is bad for the country and bad for the judiciary.”\nOn the other hand, as a judge he has criticized the Supreme Court’s doctrine of generally accepting government agencies’ interpretations of unclear federal laws. Attorney Lena Zwarensteyn of the American Constitution Society , a liberal nonprofit, said she was troubled by Gorsuch’s position.\nCourts should “make sure that administrative agencies that are responsible for such things as clean drinking water and food safety are able to exercise their expertise as opposed to a judge’s expertise,” Zwarensteyn said.\nCharles Geyh , an Indiana University law professor, said Trump’s nomination of a “mainstream conservative” like Hardiman might be a signal to Kennedy, the most moderate of the court’s current conservatives, that “if you retire I will not be replacing you with a crazy person, with someone who will make you uncomfortable.”\nBut Geyh also said even a justice like Scalia might not be entirely to Trump’s liking. He noted that Scalia was part of the court’s 5-4 majority in 1989 that declared a right of free speech to burn the American flag, an act that Trump recently said should be punished by imprisonment and perhaps a loss of citizenship.\nJudges don’t always follow their ideology, Geyh said. When the court takes up Trump’s executive order on refugees, he said, “if legislation (a 1965 federal law) prohibits you from discriminating on the basis of national origin, the fact that you’re conservative isn’t going to help you.” \n\n\n\nBob Egelko is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
