You're crying. By Julia Brucculieri \nNearly everyone and their mother expected Emma Stone to take home the Best Actress award at Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony, but that didn’t make the moment any less emotional for the “ La La Land ” star. \nWhen she gave her speech, it was clear Stone was overwhelmed with emotion, joking that she would thank and hug her friends when the feeling returned to her body. Still, she got through her moment with undeniable grace. \nThe feelings came pouring out when fellow actress and last year’s Best Actress winner, Brie Larson , came over to congratulate Stone backstage. Just as Larson opened her arms to embrace her friend in a hug, both ladies burst into tears (of the happy variety, we’re guessing). \nThe Academy captured the sweet moment on video, and it’s giving us all the feels. A post shared by The Academy (@theacademy) on Feb 26, 2017 at 9:06pm PST \nLarson also shared a photo of the touching moment on Instagram, writing, “You know what’s better than winning? Watching your friends win.” A post shared by Brie (@brielarson) on Feb 26, 2017 at 10:33pm PST \nWe’re not crying. You’re crying.
