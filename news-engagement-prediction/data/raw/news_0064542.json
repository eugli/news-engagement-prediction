They were selected from more than 60 proposals.\nA total of $875,000 has been set aside for selection, development, installation and maintenance of the projects.\nHere are the 10 public art projects approved by the region, from north to south along the line:\n\nContinuum (by Catherine Paleczny, for the Conestoga stop) \nTwo very different aspects of life in Waterloo Region are on display in Continuum – one\n\nNetwork (by Ken Hall, for the Research and Technology stop) \nNetwork contains “intricate structural connections” and programmed lights, which people can walk under and around. It is intended to reflect the idea of connectivity.\n\nThe Passenger (by Brandon Vickerd, for the Research and Technology stop) \nAt first, this sculpture looks like a person waiting for transit to arrive. On a second look, it becomes apparent that there’s much more going on.\n\nSpinal Column (by Sandra Dunn, for the Grand River Hospital stop) \nA piece of light rail track was used to create Spinal Column , a bench sculpted in a shape that reflects both the hospital near the stop and the idea of Ion as a spine of Waterloo Region.\n\nBecause Cats Can’t Fly (by Veronica and Edwin Dam de Nogales, for the Kitchener Market stop) \nInspired by the gears of local industry, bicycles and clocks, Because Cats Can’t Fly captures the region’s past and present. Its creators have created dozens of public art pieces across North America and Spain.\n\nTall Tales of Mill Street (by Terry O’Neill and Tara Cooper, for the Mill stop) \nFrom apples to sausages to Oktoberfest, the Mill Street area has plenty of connections to the history of Waterloo Region – and many of them will be on display in Tall Tales of Mill Street .\n\nThree Sisters (by Lindsay Lickers and Katharine Harvey, for the Block Line stop) \nSix Nations artist Lindsay Lickers is collaborating with Katharine Harvey for this project, which will be digitally printed on a glass wall. It depicts the story of the Three Sisters and the Young Iroquoian Boy.\n\nShaping Residency (by Stephen Cruise, for the Fairway stop) \nIn Shaping Residency, two large sculptures of birds will be designed to reflect birds common to Waterloo Region, with inspiration from local drawing traditions.\n\nArras (by Lauren Judge and Elena Chand, for the transit drivers’ facility at the Fairway stop) \nTwo local artists are getting some help from local community members for Arras , which creates a patchwork out of recognizable fabric patterns to represent the social fabric of the surrounding neighbourhood.\n\nFabric of Place (by Lilly Otasevic, for a pedestrian barrier at a spot along the line yet to be determined) \nMembers of the community will be asked to help select fabric-inspired designs for Fabric of Place , which will represent the connectedness of the community and traditional textile-making techniques.\nRelated Stories First Ion vehicle arrives in Waterloo Region", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:54:14.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
