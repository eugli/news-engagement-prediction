An post-mortem was expected to be conducted. \nA Malaysian police official, Fadzil Ahmat, told Reuters that so far there were no suspects, \"but we have started investigations and are looking at a few possibilities to get leads\". \nPolice are studying security camera footage from the airport. Images circulating in the media have focused on two women seen alongside Mr Kim, who were later seen leaving the scene in a taxi. \nUnnamed US government sources have said they believe he was poisoned by North Korean agents, but there has been no official comment from the White House. What happened? \nKim Jong-nam was attacked at about 09:00 (01:00 GMT) on Monday while waiting at the budget terminal of Kuala Lumpur International Airport for a 10:00 flight to Macau, Malaysia's Star newspaper reports , quoting police. \nExactly how the attack unfolded is still unclear.
