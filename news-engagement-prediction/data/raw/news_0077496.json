No matter what advances are made technologically or how experienced the presenter, nothing can quite protect those involved from the unexpected – especially colossal human error. \nYou may have heard by now, but at last night's Oscars, some sort of envelope sleight-of-hand/PricewaterhouseCoopers suicide mission/act of God meant that the wrong film was announced for Best Picture. Watch | Moonlight wins Best Picture after La La Land mistakenly named winner 02:06 \nS how host Jimmy Kimmel and producers from the mistakenly-awarded film, La La Land, handled the situation with enough grace and class that it wasn't as bad as it could have been (see below), but Moonlight's richly-deserved moment still lost its shine. \nAs confusion reigned, naturally, presenters Faye Dunnaway and Warren Beatty have come in for a good deal of criticism, especially on social media. Watch | How the internet reacted to the Oscars Best Picture mix-up 01:43 \nI t was brutal, awkward, tragic and, above all, wonderful viewing. But is it the worst live television mistake of recent years? \nIn a crowded field, let's consider the competition. \nMissed World \nLast year's major live-action imbecile was Steve Harvey, host of the Miss Universe beauty pageant in Las Vegas. Harvey mistakenly announced Ariadna Gutiérrez Arevalo (Miss Colombia) as the winner, despite judges having chosen Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach (Miss Philippines). \nWhat followed was an excruciating and tearful sequence in which Miss Colombia lost the crown faster than Lady Jane Grey. Watch | Miss Universe host Steve Harvey apologises for blunder 02:09 Murs goes early \nI t was quite a 2015 for Olly Murs, the nation's favourite cheeky chappy™. Having paused a roaring music career to return to his spiritual base, X Factor , as co-host with Caroline Flack, Murs had a difficult first (and only) series. Initially there were the poor reviews, then came a regretful decision to rule out sexual intercourse with Flack, and on top of it all, a sensational live TV error. \nW e're thinking of you, Oliver. How's Adam? \n2015 was full of cultural highlights, but the year in television arguably peaked in February with one glorious error during Eastenders' week of live shows. Watch | Jo Joyner fluffs her lines on EastEnders 00:25 \nW e never did find out how Adam (Woodyatt, the real name of Ian Beale) was, but it's safe to assume he felt less embarrassed than actress Jo Joyner. Guy Goma, Apple Expert \nIn 2006, business school graduate Guy Goma arrived at the BBC headquarters to interview for a job in the corporation's IT department. Here's the grilling he received instead: \nA s Goma waited in reception, a producer from BBC News 24 came looking for technology journalist Guy Kewney, who was due to discuss the naming rights case between Apple Corps and Apple Computer. Unaware there could be two Guys in the same room, the receptionist gestured towards Goma, who was promptly marched to a studio to speak live on air about a subject he knew nothing of. To make things worse, Goma didn't get the IT job either. Jim Naughtie sees Jeremy H unt next Tuesday \nNot television, but too triumphantly cathartic to exclude. There are various reasons we'll miss James Naughtie presenting Radio 4's Today Show : his lilting Scottish burr, long-winded questions and jovial patter with John Humphrys, for instance. \nThere's also the fact that he semi-regularly swore on air, and never more excellently than a now career-defining (for one of them, at least) slip-up when introducing the then Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt in 2010. \nW hen Naughtie stepped down from presenting the show after 21 years last week, Hunt tweeted, \"Bravo Jim. You conducted my most memorable interview ever, albeit not because of determined dissection of govt policy...\" Jonathan Charles, kidnapped \nBBC World News presenter Jonathan Charles received a Ron Burgundy-style lesson in the importance of punctuation in 2009. Either that or it was the most extraordinary plea for help a hostage has ever given. \nS ince the incident, Charles has been freed from the BBC and now heads up Communications at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. It's probably safer there. Alan Partridge shoots a guest \nT he above presenters should take solace – it could be worse. Rather than tripping over a teleprompter or cue card, Norwich's finest disc jockey and chat show host misfired with an actual gun on his show once. \nA-ha! Partridge wins this one...
