Here's how to find it. By Billie Streufert 9:30 am EST February 21, 2017 2 shares EMAIL (Photo: Getty Images) \nIt’s no secret there’s a hidden job market. Researchers, such as Resume Hacker, estimate only 40 percent of new employees are found through online career and job sites. If you are looking for a summer internship, deploy a robust strategy. Some organizations offer formal internship programs. Many don’t. Contacting these organizations reduces your competition and permits you to tailor positions to your interests. \nBegin your search by making a list of the employers and opportunities that appeal to you. Visit their websites to identify and apply for advertised internships. If companies have not posted vacancies, email them to inquire about possible openings. As you prepare to do so, understand and craft your message to your audience. Employers may have any of the following perspectives: The Newbie \nLeaders of start-ups manage tight budgets or haven’t yet thought about the value of internships. They need you to tell them. Offer a hassle-free solution as they continue to grow, and offer suggestions for how you can be an asset. The Wallflower \nMany organizations do not advertise their openings simply because they do not want to sort through hundreds or thousands of applications. Others are waiting for you to court and contact them directly because it demonstrates initiative — the same drive, ambition and work ethic they value on the job. Proactive outreach advances and positions you as finalists for their opportunities.

Around the time you introduce yourself, however, the need could arise. Maybe the company lands a new account. A large project deadline could be looming. Perhaps someone goes on emergency family leave. While managers may immediately consider staffing firms for these temporary problems, you offer a simpler solution without the finder fees of employment agencies. Pitch your professional agility and willingness to tailor your internship to their short-term needs. The Project Manager \nEmployers often avoid hiring interns because they think they’ll stunt their productivity and efficiency. Prove them wrong. Express a spirit of openness, an ability to work independently if needed and a willingness to immerse yourself in any and all projects — no matter how small or unexciting. Inquire about the tasks they have always wanted to complete or problems they have wanted to solve, but never found time to tackle. The Nay Sayer \nOrganizations may think both the hiring and supervision of interns are complicated, expensive and daunting. For example, employers don’t want the hassle of working around students’ co-curricular activities, classes or availability. Dispel the myths. Emphasize your willingness to accommodate their schedule and clarify that the internship credit paperwork required of your university is minimal. \nIn addition to understanding employers’ reservations and needs, you will be more successful in your inquiry if the message comes from people they know and trust. Network through alumni, faculty, professional associations, friends, family and your campus career center. Mention the names of these individuals and referral sources in your opening statement. Ask your contacts to speak with managers and endorse you behind the scenes.

If you struggle to identify organizations in your preferred field, speak with your campus career center and faculty. Also, browse chamber directories, LinkedIn, alumni databases, professional associations or commercial search engines. \nFinally, there’s no need to be desperate. Be ready to describe the tasks that appeal most to you given your professional goals. Reflect on your interests and research the core competencies needed to excel in the future. To do so, view the description of your desired occupation on O*Net , browse the career paths and points of entry for professionals on LinkedIn or conduct a mock job search on commercial search engines. If you were graduating and looking for your dream job now, what qualifications are organizations seeking? Develop these skills and abilities during your internship so you can compete in the future workplace. \nAlthough creating an internship often requires more work than an established program, the experience can be rewarding. Be persistent and patient. Locating a position that is tailored to your interests is far more valuable than settling for whatever else you can find. \nBillie Streufert serves at Augustana University, S.D., as the director of the Student Success Center.
