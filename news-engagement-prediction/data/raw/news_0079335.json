Germany’s security services have even mulled the creation of a special unit to tackle 'fake news' exclusively. \nBut while the German government is preoccupied with countering perceived “Russian propaganda” in the Baltic states, it turns a blind eye to the very real and discriminatory “non-citizen” status of Russian speakers in these countries, Rainer Rothfuss, a political analyst and consultant told RT.

Germany’s forces, deployed to Lithuania, plays a major role in this buildup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:25:32.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
