News break - February 22 \nThe 42-year-old man attacked the woman at her home at Dakabin, north of Brisbane, when she returned from work on October 7 last year. \nThe Brisbane District Court heard on Wednesday that he threatened to stab her, punched and slapped her repeatedly, held a pillow over her face, slammed her head into couch frame, and then choked her for about 10 seconds. The court heard the man had taken ice just three days before, and that he had been struggling to deal with the loss of his job and breakdown of his relationship. Source: 7 News \nThe court heard the attack, which left the woman with cuts and bruises to her face, was carried out in front of their one-year-old son. \nThe man pleaded guilty to one count each of assault occasioning bodily harm, choking, suffering or strangulation in a domestic setting, and contravening a domestic violence order. \nProsecutor Matt Le Grand said the man had been at the home with the woman's permission to look after their sick son, despite him being banned from visiting her home under the DVO. \nPolice had advised the woman to write a letter giving permission for him to be there until she returned from work. The man was at the home with his former partner's permission, in spite of the DVO. Source: Supplied \nHowever, when she presented him with the letter and he realised he was not going to be allowed to stay with her and his son, he \"snapped\" and lashed out. \nThe court heard he had taken ice just three days before, and that he had been struggling to deal with the loss of his job and breakdown of his relationship. \nJudge Helen Bowskill said this did not excuse his conduct, and said personal and public deterrence were of the utmost importance in determining his sentence. \nShe sentenced him to 20 months' jail and ordered he serve six months before being released on parole. \nHe has served 138 days in pre-sentence custody. \nNational domestic violence helpline: 1800 737 732 or 1800RESPECT.
