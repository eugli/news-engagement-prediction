He just wanted to go to the hospital.\nWilliam Dunbar, 50, was shot by a woman he said he’d been arguing with, but he “refused” to disclose the source of the disagreement, according to a DeKalb County police report.\nMore than a month later, the motive for the shooting, which led to Dunbar’s death weeks later, still hasn’t come out, even as the DeKalb Sheriff’s Office Fugitive Unit made a second arrest.\nKellyAnn Latoyia Gerrow, 24, and Geneva Gibson, 22, who both have a Marietta address, are charged with murder. Gibson was arrested Wednesday in Cobb and is in the DeKalb jail, the sheriff’s office said; Gerrow has been in the DeKalb jail since mid-January.\nThey are accused of driving up to Dunbar as he returned from his mailbox outside Regal Vista Apartments off Pleasantdale Road near Doraville. Without a word, one of the women got out of the car and shot him in the abdomen, police said. It isn’t clear which woman is accused of pulling the trigger.\nRELATED: Cops: Man told MARTA panhandler to get a job before killing on train\nRELATED: Metro Atlanta families upset, in limbo after adoption agency closes\nRELATED: Cops: DeKalb tormentors use hot spatula in 3 days of ‘savage’ torture\nAs he bled in the parking lot, Dunbar told police he’d been in an argument with one of the women on Thanksgiving. But he thought it was over, the police report said.\nHe said he didn’t know the women’s names, but pointed to an apartment where he believed one of them was living. Police went to the door; no one answered.\nDunbar died Jan. 13 of what the medical examiner reportedly called an embolism caused by the gunshot wound.\nLike DeKalb County News Now on Facebook | Follow on Twitter and Instagram", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/dekalbnewsnow/", "https://twitter.com/DeKalbNewsNow", "https://www.facebook.com/dekalbnewsnow/"], "published": "2017-02-09T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T08:34:32.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
