We should not blame anyone for the ruling because it is not going to affect the negotiations and the collective bargaining agreement,” said Mr Munya. \nThe Meru governor urged doctors to reconsider their demands, saying the government cannot afford to implement the 2013 CBA that sought to improve their salaries and working conditions in public hospitals. \nCONSIDER DEMANDS \nMr Munya urged the health workers to compare their salaries with those of others in third world countries rather than demanding what doctors are paid in developed countries.
