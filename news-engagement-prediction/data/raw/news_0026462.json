But dance director Saroj Khan, who choreographed the original in Thanedaar featuring Madhuri Dixit and Sanjay Dutt, is unsure if the new-age actors can do justice to it. \nKhan maintains she will “comment only after the song is out and I have seen it”, but on being prodded to share her expectations, she says, “Varun is a good dancer and I know he will be able to do it [the steps] well, but I don’t know if Alia will be able to match up to Madhuri. In any case, it will be a feather in Alia’s cap.” \nAlia Bhatt, Madhuri Dixit and Varun Dhawan \nA video of Mads helping the duo get the steps right is being promoted online, but Khan is yet to see it. Asked if she feels the film’s makers should have asked her to choreograph the new song too, she retorts, “Maybe, they think that Masterji [referring to herself] has become old and Madhuri Dixit hasn’t. That’s why they have called her.” \nA still from the original Tamma Tamma song \nReminiscing working on the 1990 song, she says, “I told the makers I’d take a month to train Sanjay for the song and he agreed. My assistants used to go to another set to rehearse with him.” Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:03:56.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
