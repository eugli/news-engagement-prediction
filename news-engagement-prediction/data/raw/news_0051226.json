SEE ALSO: One of the largest icebergs ever seen is even closer to breaking off Antarctica \nThe iceberg, as tracked by aerial observations and satellite data, that is likely to break off is about 1,930 square miles, or about the size of Delaware. \nResearchers from Project MIDAS, led by Swansea University, have reported several rapid elongations of the crack in recent years. This footage was shot by scientists from the British Antarctic Survey as they flew over the Larsen C Ice Shelf to collect research equipment, according to a press release. \nIcebergs calving off of glaciers and floating ice shelves are not by themselves unusual events. \nHowever, many Antarctic ice shelves have been thinning as a result of climate change and other factors, and this particular iceberg is expected to be unusually large.
