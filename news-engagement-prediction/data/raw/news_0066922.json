There was of course a joke behind it. Manager Joe Maddon has been preaching “humility” for the Cubs, so the thought process was what could display that trait better than a sports car that sells for a quarter-million dollars? \n“That was pretty good,” Maddon said. \n“The car continues to be parked out there, which I love. I hope everybody gets the sarcasm involved.” \n— Ryan Baker (@RyanBakerMedia) February 21, 2017 Tim Buss puts the hex on complacency: pic.twitter.com/s0Y6Y8nE0G", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:17:10.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
