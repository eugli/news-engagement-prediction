In addition, buyers will only have to pay a 5 per cent deposit on exchange – half of the usual 10 per cent, with the remainder being able to be paid in two more instalments. \nSixty units at Mirvac’s Pavilions complex that are eligible for the government’s First Home Owner Grant or stamp duty concessions will be quarantined for first-home buyers.

The Sydney median house price now stands at $1.1 million. \nOne expert in housing affordability welcomed the Right Start plan, but said it was only a drop in the ocean of solving the issue of young people being unable to get into the housing market. \nMirvac has just unveiled its new development at Sydney Olympic Park, comprising of four BVN-designed apartment buildings. Photo: Supplied \nAdrian Pisarski, the executive officer of housing affordability group National Shelter, said, “It’s a good thing that Mirvac is prioritising allowing first home buyers in buying new apartments, and relaxing the deposit restrictions, but how many people is that going to help? \n“Whilst it might help those in a position to be able to buy, and take up this offer, it isn’t really doing much about the quantum of the housing affordability problem we’ve got here. The problem isn’t so much first-home buyers getting access to property; it’s more a problem of price. Most won’t be in a position to be able to afford what they’re offering.” \nUrban Taskforce Australia CEO Chris Johnson also said it was a welcome initiative but first home buyers still needed to be able to pay those prices. “Any effort that helps with housing affordability is a very welcome one,” he said. \n“But I would be concerned if someone could buy something like this and sell it fairly quickly at a profit which is why I think most of the affordable housing is more rental. A reduced deposit is a good thing but if the property is still expensive, it makes it hard to make it all still stack up.” \nMirvac has just unveiled its new development at Sydney Olympic Park, comprising four BVN-designed apartment buildings. The tallest will have 296 apartments over 31 levels, the 22-level block will have 264 apartments, the 12-level will have 69 and the nine-level, 60, set in 430 hectares of parkland. \nThere will be a selection of one, two and three-bedroom apartments, skyhouses and penthouses, as well as two-storey terrace homes, with prices as high as $2 million, with the buildings helping make up a gateway to the area. \nThe complex will also include an additional 21 affordable apartments for the Sydney Olympic Park Authority, reserved for “essential workers” like ambulance and fire staff and nurses. The area is earmarked for a future Sydney Metro West fast rail, with details yet to be announced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:01:34.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
