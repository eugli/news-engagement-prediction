That’s a good start”.

Training: Prince William listened in on a call from a young homeless person (Kensington Palace) \nHe said had sought help for his homelessness from his local authority but to no avail so far. \nAfter listening to his situation, Ms Lewis texted him details of how to get into a Winter night shelter to get off the streets short term and also suggested a day centre for young people where he would be able to get more long-term help with housing, getting into work and benefits. \nThe Prince was clearly moved by the young person’s plight, and said the way the call was handled was “really good”. Young and homeless: The boy who called in had been robbed twice living on the streets (Kensington Palace) \nHe said: “If nothing else, you take the time to listen to them, to tell them their options.” Prince William also asked to be kept informed about the teenager’s journey to hopefully be helped out of homelessness. \nMr Lebedev said: “I’m delighted to have launched the helpline with the Duke of Cambridge today. It was his call to arms in November that spurred us on to launch the campaign. \n“Youth homelessness is an unacceptable blight in modern Britain. The helpline will save lives and rescue countless more from vulnerable and perilous situations. Launch: The Duke of Cambridge arriving at The Mix in London to launch the Centrepoint Helpline (PA) \n“None of it would have been possible without the hard work of hundreds of people behind the scenes - Centrepoint, Standard staff, as well as the thousands of readers who have given so generously - so I’d like to thank them.” \nCalling for action in November, William wrote a letter to Standard readers saying: “When a young person’s life falls apart they have nowhere to go. Young and homeless: The helpline will help countless young people who are facing homelessness (Alex Lentati/ Jeremy Selwyn) \n\"This is why we are launching the Centrepoint Helpline. [It] will provide the information and support young people need before they become homeless. \n“Over the past decade I have met hundreds of courageous and inspiring young people trying to escape homelessness. Unfortunately their courage alone is not enough.” \nThe prince has thanked readers for their “incredible” support during the appeal.

Centrepoint helpline:The Prmie Minister Theresa May backs the Evening Standard's Christmas campaign \n\"It’s the culmination of months of campaigning, fundraising and generosity on the part of so many people, including the readers of the Independent, The i , and Evening Standard. \n\"There can be no acceptance of rough sleeping in modern Britain – that’s why we are taking action to tackle the causes of homelessness through our £50 million trailblazers fund, and investing in services that take people off the street. \n\"With government action and support from people across society, this helpline can make a real difference to those people teetering on the brink of rough sleeping.\" Centrepoint campaign: Streets Of London Poem | Hussain's House \nIt is hoped the service will become the first stop for young people who are facing homelessness or already living on the streets. \nIt aims to end the current postcode lottery of advice - currently, at least 30,000 of more than 150,000 young people who each year ask for help with homelessness from local authorities are believed to be turned away with no support. \nAs well as providing housing support, experts will advise on issues that often lie behind homelessness such as mental health problems or family breakdown. Homeless charity: Centrepoint CEO Seyi Obakin at a sleepout event with Sadie Frost (NIGEL HOWARD) \nStaff will plug into a nationwide network of contacts, ensuring people can be directed towards local help. \nMr Obakin said: “Today, with the launch of the helpline, we take a major step towards realising our ambitious goal to end youth homelessness. \n“In many towns and cities youth homelessness is reaching crisis point. Centrepoint poem about homelessness \n\"Our research shows that for each young person sleeping on the streets, dozens more spend night after night on sofas of extended family and friends and, in some cases, in the beds of strangers. \n“Some of these young people will have fled constant family arguments or violent partners, others will have exhausted the generosity of friends and find they have nowhere else to turn. \n“It doesn’t have to be this way. Intervening early and decisively can change a young person’s future. Labour leader: Jeremy Corbyn hailed the incredible response of readers (JEREMY SELWYN) \n“That is what we now aim to do with the helpline.” \nLabour leader, Jeremy Corbyn hailed the inspiring response the helpline appeal has had, saying: “One in three young people seeking specialist help are being turned away by councils because of a lack of resources. \n“That's why this helpline, reform to 'intentionally homeless' rules and proper funding for local government is so badly needed. Jeremy Corbyn visits Centrepoint \n“I’m pleased that readers have donated in such numbers – and I think the incredible response to this appeal shows people’s determination to make sure that homelessness has no place in a 21st century Britain.\" \nLib Dem leader Tim Farron added: “Thanks to the generosity of those who’ve supported this appeal, many lives will be changed for the better. \n\"This helpline will be crucial for those who have been let down time and time again.” Centrepoint campaign: Sadiq Khan backs the Evening Standard's Chirstmas appeal \nAnd London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: “The overwhelming response to [this] fundraising appeal is a tribute to how concerned people are about this problem. \n\"Centrepoint‘s new helpline will be a lifeline to many vulnerable young people.” \nKumba Kpakima, 18, who became homeless when her life fell apart after the death of her mother when she was 15, said: “I think the campaign has been great. Homeless appeal: Mayor Sadiq Khan praised Londoners (PA) \n\"More people are aware of how [homelessness] can affect anyone. It’s not drug addicts, it’s bad things that happen to people which are out of their control. \n\"It is something that a lot of people go through and it doesn’t have to be the breaking point in their lives. It has changed people’s attitudes. \n“I’m pleased the helpline is here. It will be a lifeline for people in a state of emergency who need help immediately, and people who just need someone to talk to and some advice. Centrepoint resident interns at the Evening Standard \nThe aspiring journalist, who has met Prince William and did a week’s work experience with the Standard during the appeal, said the experiences had “given me more confidence” \n“It’s good to know there are people out there who want to give opportunities to young people like me, they want to support us and see us do well,” she said. \n“Thank you to everyone who has supported the appeal.” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:52:53.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
