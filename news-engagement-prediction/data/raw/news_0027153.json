(Getty Images) \nUpdated at 10:54 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 10:54 a.m. ET \nBelieve it or not, the dunk contest was once, in fact, good. \nWay back before the event was filled with 11th men and no-name rookies, the most athletic stars in the NBA used to actually compete, and it was rigtheous. \nHere is a rundown of the best individual dunks in the contest's history. (Spoiler alert: There are none from the past five years.) \nMORE: Top 15 NBA point guards for 2016-17: Ranking the league's deepest position Vince Carter's arm-in-basket dunk, 2000 \nThis is the dunk. When I hear the phrase \"slam dunk,\" it's Vince Carter dangling on the rim like it's his squaredance partner that immediately comes to mind. This is just an ultimate display of physical skill and creativty. Who thinks to do that? Dee Brown's no-look dunk, 1991 \nSpud Webb and Nate Robinson rightfully get credit as the best small-guy dunkers, but in terms of a defining dunk, give me Dee Brown's no-looker. He was a bit taller than those guys at 6-1, but the space between his legs and the ground is a sight to behold. Many have aped this since, but like a great song, no cover can top the original. \nMORE: Knicks owner James Dolan sinks to new low in petty battle with Charles Oakley JaVale McGee's two ball dunk, 2011 \nThis dunk has been kind of lost in the annals of history because, well, JaVale McGee didn't win the dunk contest in 2011, and because JaVale McGee is JaVale McGee. But this dunk has all the staples of what makes dunk contests great: creativity, props that actually make sense on a basketball court â€” i.e. not a cupcake . Michael Jordan's free throw line dunk \nWhile I think a good amount of today's NBA players could pull off this dunk, there is no denying how iconic this dunk is. It's the Jordan logo, and along with his shot to beat the Jazz, the definining image of the greatest player in NBA history. Still, it doesn't hold much of a candle to his slam that beat the Monstars . \nMORE: On brink of fire sale, winning streak turns Heat into deadline buyers Dwight Howard's 12-foot rim Superman dunk, 2009 \nThere are plenty of things people can criticize Dwight Howard for, but creativity isn't one of them. In 2009, Howard took advantage of the \"getting props approved\" rule, bringing in a 12-foot rim, Superman cape and phonebooth for him to change from Clark Kent to the Man of Steel. He makes leaping to the insanely high basket look like a cakewalk, only leaving a desire for him to have gone even higher.
