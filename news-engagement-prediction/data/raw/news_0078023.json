Howbow dah?\" \nFor those who speak the English language in the way it is intended, the catchphrase roughly translates to: \"Catch me outside. How about that?\" \nThe Florida teenager first came to prominence after appearing on popular US self-help program Dr Phil , where the television psychologist attempted to counsel her out of her bad behaviour. \nShe was brought onto the program by her mother, who claimed to be at her wits' end as to how to put a stop to her daughter's out-of-control behaviour. \nHowever, the stint on the television psychologist's show appears not to have done any good - for Miss Bregoli or her mother, \nThe pair were banned from Spirit Airlines after becoming involved in a brawl on their return flight to Florida after filming for the episode wrapped in Los Angeles earlier this month. \nThe not so softly-spoken mother and daughter were involved in a physical fight on an airplane on their return flight to Florida after filming for the Dr Phil episode wrapped in Los Angeles. \n\"She was saying she was going to fight me. My mom was like put your hands on my kid. My mom took her by her throat, pushed her back and then the lady pushed my mom back,\" Miss Bregoli said in an Instagram video. \n\"She got her ass whooped by a f--ing 13-year-old cause you wanna’ do heroin and snort f–-king crack and drink.\" \nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office are yet to respond to Miss Bregoli's latest incident, according to Palm Beach Post . © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:24:14.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
