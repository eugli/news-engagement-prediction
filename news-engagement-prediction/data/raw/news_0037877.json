Donald Trump speaks during the press conference (left), and Barack Obama during his time as president Credit: AP/PA \nUS President Donald Trump told a news conference on Thursday that he \"inherited a mess\" from his predecessor, Barack Obama. \nDuring his speech President Trump also attacked \"fake news\" reports about his time in office as \"dishonest\", and hailed his administration as a \"fine-tuned machine\" that is battling Mr Obama's \"mess\". \nBut how do the Republican's claims compare against the facts? Mad? Bad? Trump's media performance was actually sad - ITV News Washington Correspondent Robert Moore gives his thoughts on President Trump's news conference. Donald Trump told reporters he had 'inherited a mess'. Credit: AP Trump: \"To be honest I inherited a mess. It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess\" \nBy most economic measures Barack Obama inherited a far worse situation when he became president in 2009, than he left for President Trump. \nMr Obama also had to deal with the worst economic downturn since the Depression of the 1930s. \nUnemployment was increasing, the stock market crashing, the car industry failing and millions of Americans risked losing their homes due to not being able to meet their mortgage payments when Mr Obama was sworn into office, yet none of these statistics are as dire for Donald Trump. \nUnemployment is 4.8%, compared with a peak of 10% during Mr Obama's first year as president. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was sinking until March 2009, only to rebound roughly 200% over the rest of Mr Obama's term - gains that have continued under President Trump on the promise of tax and regulatory cuts. \nWhen the billionaire businessman assumed office in January, a greater percentage of the country had health insurance, incomes were rising and the country was creating jobs. \nThe Trump administration has noted that a smaller proportion of the population is working or looking for jobs. But even this measure began to turn around toward the end of the Obama era. A coal mine in Decker, Montana.

Trump: \"ISIS has spread like cancer, another mess I inherited\" \nSo-called Islamic State has been losing ground in Iraq, Syria, and Libya since before Donald Trump took office. \nThe gradual military process achieved in Iraq during Mr Obama's final two years has pushed so-called Islamic State to the point of collapse in Mosul, its main stronghold in Iraq . \nHowever, the militant group remains a threat despite its shrinking territory, telling its followers to carry out acts of terrorism.

This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my Cabinet approved\" \nDonald Trump's first 28 days in office have contained many contentious and problematic moments, and produced much less significant legislation than Mr Obama enacted during his first month. \nIn his first month, Mr Obama signed a Â£630 billion stimulus package into law, as well as a law expanding health care for children and the Lilly Ledbetter bill on equal pay for women. \nMr Trump has vigorously produced executive orders, which do not require congressional approval and typically have narrow effect. The one with far-reaching consequences - banning entry by refugees and by visitors from seven countries - has been blocked by courts . Protesters demonstrate against Trump's travel ban.

I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan\" \nIn the seven previous elections the winner of five of those contests won a larger Electoral College majority than Mr Trump. They were George HW Bush in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996; and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. George HW Bush in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996; and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 all won larger Electoral College majorities than Donald Trump. Credit: PA \nDuring the press conference a reporter pointed out that Mr Trump was overstating his winning margin, to which he replied: \"Well, I don't know, I was given that information\", but insisted it was \"a very substantial victory\". \nPresident Trump actually ended up with 304 electoral votes because of the defection of two electors in December, but he had won enough states in November to get to 306.
