Article continues below \nFortunately for Griezmann, though, Fernando Torres was on hand to (sort of) spare his blushes. \nThe Spanish striker bundled in the rebound for his first goal of the afternoon before doubling both his and Atletico’s tally early in the second half. Article continues below Watch: Griezmann's questionable reaction after Torres scored against Leganes Little has been said about Griezmann's reaction \nHowever, very little has been made about Griezmann’s deflated reaction immediately after Torres put Atleti 1-0 ahead. \nThe France international stood just outside the six-yard box before putting his head back and then slowly walking over to where his teammates were celebrating. Watch: Griezmann looked gutted Reaction would have been different if this was Cristiano \nGriezmann was clearly still gutted - and you can understand why - but shouldn’t he have shown a little more pleasure that his side had just taken the lead? \nThis was a fixture Diego Simeone’s side could ill-afford to lose, so it shouldn’t have mattered who stuck the ball in the back of the net. The most important thing is it went in. \nJust imagine if Cristiano Ronaldo had done the same thing while playing for Real Madrid. \nThe Portuguese striker has been slammed on social media for displaying similar reactions to such moments in the past, so Griezmann is a little fortunate to avoid widespread criticism on this occasion. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
