(AP Photo/Blake Nicholson) BISMARCK, N.D. — The Latest on plans to close a protest encampment near the Dakota Access pipeline construction site in North Dakota (all times local):\n8:30 a.m.\nDakota Access pipeline protesters are ceremonially burning some of their living structures ahead of the closure of a longstanding camp in North Dakota.\nAbout 200 to 300 protesters remain at the camp near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. The Army Corps of Engineers has ordered the camp closed at 2 p.m. Wednesday, citing the potential for spring flooding.\nThose left in camp milled about peacefully Wednesday, many in prayer. At least four wooden structures were being burned in what protesters say is part of the ceremony of leaving.\nNestor Silva, of California, says he is planning to move to a nearby camp being set up on land leased by the Cheyenne River Sioux. Law enforcement say they expect to make some arrests, but Silva says he doesn't expect any trouble.\n___\n6:30 a.m.\nAuthorities in North Dakota are offering assistance and services to Dakota Access pipeline protesters as they close a longstanding encampment near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation.\nUp to 300 people remain at the camp, down from thousands at the protest's peak. The Army Corps of Engineers has ordered the camp closed at 2 p.m. Wednesday, citing the dangers of impending spring floods.\nNorth Dakota state officials have set up a travel assistance center. They're offering personal kits, water and snacks, health assessments, bus fare for protesters to travel home, and food and hotel vouchers.\nThey're planning to start buses from the camp to Bismarck at 9 a.m. But law enforcement officials say they expect some protesters won't leave without being arrested.\n___\n12:16 a.m.\nThe Army Corps of Engineers' plan to close a Dakota Access pipeline protest camp isn't likely to end on-the-ground opposition in North Dakota.\nIt also may not spell the end of heavy law enforcement presence near where the Dallas-based developer is finishing the last big section of the pipeline. When completed, the pipeline will carry oil from North Dakota through the Dakotas and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois.\nThe protest camp has been around since August and at times housed thousands of people. The Corps has told the few hundred who remain that they must leave by 2 p.m. Wednesday. The Corps says it's concerned about potential flooding as snow melts.\nProtest leader Phyllis Young says many will just go to new camps on private land.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:57:39.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
