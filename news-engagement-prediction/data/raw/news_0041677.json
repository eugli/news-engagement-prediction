(Chris Young / THE CANADIAN PRESS)   4:17PM EST \nTORONTO - Loblaw has reset passwords for all its PC Plus rewards collectors' online accounts after points were stolen from some members' accounts. \nThe company (TSX:L) posted a warning on its website saying it requires all members to create new passwords - regardless of whether or not they changed them following the recent security breach. \nEarlier this month, Loblaw urged members to create unique, secure passwords after some people noticed their points were missing. \nThe company said at the time that the breach stemmed from people using favourite or weak username and password combinations across multiple sites. Those were stolen from other sites and used to access PC Plus accounts. \nThe company said it's reimbursing members whose points were stolen.
