Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFormer EastEnders star Louisa Lytton could be returning to Albert Square - as Lee Ryan’s new character “Woody” Woodward’s love interest. \nWell, if Lee has his way, that is! \nLee’s casting in the soap as heartbreaker Woody was announced last week, much to the delight of many fans of the Blue singer, and on Sunday Brunch, pal Louisa was asked if she could be in the frame for a comeback. \nLouisa - who played Ruby Allen in EastEnders - explained: “Lee texted me a year ago and I said the role would be good for him.

I can’t wait for people to see what he’s like for themselves. \n\"Everyone at EastEnders has been so welcoming. I know some of the cast already so I’m sure we’re going to have a lot of fun.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T17:13:13.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
