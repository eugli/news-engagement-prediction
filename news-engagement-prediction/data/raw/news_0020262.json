Coal burning linked to toxic contaminants found in raccoons February 1, 2017 \nCoal-burning power plants produce more than half of the electricity in the U.S., and they generate huge amounts of coal ash in the process. One type of coal ash is a fine, powdery particle called fly ash, which for many years ... Study: Fish near coal-fired power plants have lower levels of mercury October 6, 2010 \nA new study from North Carolina State University finds that fish located near coal-fired power plants have lower levels of mercury than fish that live much further away. The surprising finding appears to be linked to high ... Oxygen key to containing coal ash contamination April 12, 2016 \nAs energy companies decide what to do with aging coal ash disposal facilities in North Carolina and across the nation, they may be overlooking a fundamental but potentially critical variable—oxygen. Coal ash taints water in five states, study says June 14, 2016 \nA study of North Carolina and four other southeastern states found evidence that coal ash ponds consistently contaminate nearby lakes, rivers and groundwater, Duke University scientists say. Store-bought freshwater fish contain elevated levels of mercury, arsenic and selenium November 7, 2007 \nWhite bass wild-caught and sold commercially contained significantly higher levels of mercury, arsenic and selenium than fish caught near former industrial areas.
