Given that Zak has once had an affair with Faith, who was with his brother Shadrach at the time (and thus Cain was born), could he be tempted by her once more? \nLisa is more than uncomfortable with having Faith on the seen and when she starts flirting up a storm with Zak, Lisa fears the worst. (Picture: ITV) \nAs Lisa confides in Belle that she thinks Zak might be having an affair, mischievous Faith enjoys playing on Lisa’s paranoia and plays up to it. \nAt Lisa’s birthday, things come to a head when Lisa overhears comments made by Faith to Zak and takes them as a play for her husband. But as a showdown explodes, has Lisa gotten the wrong end of the stick? \nOr is she right to worry that Zak might be interested in pursuing a romance with Faith? \nOne to watch: Thursday 16th February at 7pm on ITV.
