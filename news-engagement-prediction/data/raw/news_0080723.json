Cullinan could not immediately be reached for comment. \nREAD MORE: How the Oscars’ Best Picture envelope mix-up unfolded \nThe mistake was not rectified until the “La La Land” cast and producers were on stage giving their acceptance speeches. It was left to the musical’s producer, Jordan Horowitz, to put things right. \n“Guys, guys, I’m sorry. No. There’s a mistake,” Horowitz said. “‘Moonlight,’ you guys won best picture. This is not a joke.” Moonlight wins Best Picture after crazy Oscar announcement mixup ‘Moonlight’ star Mahershala Ali says he was ‘thrown a bit’ by Best Picture mishap \nIt took three hours for PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has been overseeing Academy Awards balloting for 83 years, to confirm that Beatty and Dunaway received the wrong category envelope. \nPwC said it took full responsibility and apologized to the casts and crews of “La La Land” and “Moonlight.” \n“We sincerely apologize to Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, (host) Jimmy Kimmel, (broadcaster) ABC, and the Academy, none of whom was at fault for last night’s errors,” it said in its statement. \nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organizes the Oscars, said it “deeply” regretted the mistake, before passing the buck onto PwC. \nREAD MORE: 5 most controversial things that happened at the 2017 Oscars, on top of #OscarsGate \n“We apologize to the entire cast and crew of La La Land and Moonlight whose experience was profoundly altered by this error,” the statement read. \n“We salute the tremendous grace they displayed under the circumstances. To all involved — including our presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, the filmmakers, and our fans watching worldwide — we apologize.” The Academy's statement on the 89th Oscars Best Picture. https://t.co/wN66XSyj85 \n— The Academy (@TheAcademy) February 28, 2017 \nAn embarrassed Beatty carried the envelope to the glitzy Governor’s Ball after the show, with the writing clearly saying “actress in a leading role.”“La La Land” star Stone had been awarded that Oscar moments before. \n“Except for the end, it was fun,” Kimmel said on Monday, referring to the Oscar show he hosted. \n“You know it’s a strange night when the word ‘envelope’ is trending on Twitter,” he said on his ABC show “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” \nWATCH: ET: Canada’s take on the 2017 Oscars ‘Moonlight’ Mix-Up “Not Advanced Math” \nBrand management experts said it could take years for PricewaterhouseCoopers to recover. \n“This is not advanced math. PwC had to get the right name in the right envelope and get it to the right person,” said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University, calling the blunder a “bit of a branding tragedy.” \nUnder a PwC procedure, just two accountants know the names of the 24 winners after their names are placed in two sets of sealed envelopes. The two accountants also memorize the winning names. \nTradition has it that the envelopes are taken separately in two briefcases to the Academy Awards venue. The two accountants – in this case Cullinan and Martha Ruiz – are driven there separately, in case of an accident or traffic delays. \nThe pair then stand off stage at opposite sides and hand envelopes to the respective presenters as each category is announced. \nLast week, Cullinan told the Huffington Post the procedure for dealing with the hand-off of an incorrect envelope, other than signaling to a stage manager, was unclear. \n“It’s so unlikely,” Cullinan added. \nREAD MORE: Oscars 2017 winners list: ‘Moonlight’ wins Best Picture after bizarre gaffe, ‘La La Land’ takes home 6 \nThe error was corrected quickly, although precious minutes passed, said Anthony Sabino, a law professor at St John’s University in New York. \n“It’s not as if we woke up this morning, or if it had been uncovered after the telecast was over. That would have really have been a black eye,” he added. \nCompared to accounting fraud at other companies in the past, “this incident diminished vastly to a vanishing point,” Sabino said. \nThe “Moonlight” filmmakers were gracious about the error. \nDirector Barry Jenkins told reporters backstage that he received no immediate explanation for the mix-up, though “it made a very special feeling even more special, but not in the way I expected.” \nJenkins added, “Please write this down: The folks from ‘La La Land’ were so gracious.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:43:17.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
