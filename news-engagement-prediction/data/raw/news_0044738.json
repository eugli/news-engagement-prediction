Well, another company is doing something similar! \nBusabout, a travel company, is currently seeking two new hires! A brand ambassador and also a video producer. Both jobs will require you to take trips across Europe this summer and since this is a job - the company will be paying! \nThe company covers flights to and from Europe, accommodations, excursions and they will give you money towards your daily food! All you have to do is document the experience on social media - Instagrams, v-logs etc. Easy enough! \nSo basically you get to travel for five months from April to September exploring Paris, Swiss Alps, Ibiza and more! If you're interested in applying for this dream job they are asking to send a three-minute video talking about yourself and showing off your social media skills! \nMore deets: A post shared by Busabout (@busabouteurope) on Feb 21, 2017 at 3:00am PST \nSource: Instagram ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:21:13.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
