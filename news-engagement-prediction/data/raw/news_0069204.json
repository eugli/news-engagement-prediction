Photo: Courtesy of LVMH Prize After reviewing a record-breaking 1,200-plus applications from all over the world, the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers has short-listed 21 semifinalists. What’s more, the prize committee has a surprise addition to its 40-strong panel of experts: Kendall Jenner will join fellow model-experts Karlie Kloss and Natalia Vodianova in casting votes to arrive at eight finalists. In the coming months, LVMH’s stable of designers and select executives will determine who takes home the 300,000-euro prize. The winner (or winners) will be announced on June 16 at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. In an exclusive interview, Delphine Arnault, the LVMH Prize founder and executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, spoke with Vogue.com about the process and late-breaking news from the inside. How is this fourth edition shaping up? This year we had more than 1,200 applications, the most we’ve ever received. We selected 21. The specificity of the prize is that it is completely international and online, and the response reflects that openness. There are short-listers from the U.S., Spain, France, Denmark, Germany, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. In terms of the fashion, nine labels design womenswear, 10 design menswear, and two design for both men and women. They range in age from 22 to 39. Some have just begun, while others are up and running. There’s real diversity there. And we’re all really excited to meet them. How does the selection process work internally for this first wave? It’s actually a months-long process, because we have a handful of scouts all over the world who are always on the lookout for new talent. It’s very important to us to have a large pool of different profiles. Once the competition opens, a small in-house committee of four people considers each submission and selects the semifinalists. Do you see any trends emerging among young fashion designers now? Right now we’re seeing a surge in menswear designers. It will be interesting to see how many of them emerge among the eight finalists once the experts have cast their votes. There’s also a major sportswear influence running through the collections. And looks for both men and women, more unisex. I look forward to meeting them and seeing their work up close. When you can touch the clothes and see how they’re constructed, you get a better idea of the brand’s philosophy and the work behind it. And Paris Fashion Week is what takes it to the next level. Yes, the showroom for the semifinalists will be held at our headquarters on the Avenue Montaigne for two days, on March 2 and 3. That’s when all those who can help young designers—the journalists, photographers, stylists, buyers, and experts—can get to know their work. Even if not every candidate makes it to the finals, I hope that this competition will allow them to meet as many people as possible and that it will help them grow their brands. The showroom is where you first meet them? Nabil Nayal was among the semifinalists two years ago, so we’ve already met and I’m interested to see how his work has evolved since then. The other brands are all new to me. It’s always a really big moment when you meet them in the showroom. I love seeing their energy, creativity, and drive. I really admire young people with an entrepreneurial spirit who want to build something. They have a real vision and a point of view. The jury is evolving: Dior artistic director Maria Grazia Chiuri has joined and Riccardo Tisci is leaving the group. Will he still participate in the jury? Yes, absolutely; Riccardo will be with us to present the prize. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:50:36.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
