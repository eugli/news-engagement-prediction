TinyCo and FoxNext have announced that they will be creating a new Futurama mobile game called Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow . If that wasn’t exciting enough, the series’ original creators are helping with the development of the game. \n“I love this game because it feels just like Futurama ,” says Matt Groening, creator and Executive Producer of Futurama and The Simpsons . “Except now you get to jab the characters in the face.” \nAccording to the press release, TinyCo is working with Rough Draft Studios for this project. Rough Draft is the same studio that produced the original Futurama TV show. This will “bring the show’s trademark humor, signature visual style, and ensemble comedic adventure to mobile players everywhere.” \n“ Futurama is back, bigger and better than ever! Or possibly smaller and equally good. But either way, it’s back!” said David X. Cohen, co-developer with Matt Groening and Executive Producer of Futurama . “We’ve got completely new stories from the original writers, cast, and animators. This is the real Futurama deal.” \nThe press release didn’t specify what sort of game Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow will be. At this point, it could be any genre. Regardless, this is great news for fans of the series — even for those who aren’t particularly fond of mobile games. If anything, this will be a fun title that will no doubt have a ton of references from the TV series. It’ll also have the original cast, which is great since I personally miss hearing the sound of Zoidberg’s voice. \nFuturama: Worlds of Tomorrow will be available on the App Store, Google Play, and the Amazon Appstore this summer.
