Photo: Isabella Lettini \n\"Questions regarding donations should be directed to the Secretariat of the Liberal Party of Australia (NSW Division).\" \nProperty developers have been prohibited from donating to NSW state election campaigns since 2010. Advertisement \nIn a statement on Wednesday, Ms Berejiklian said political donations were managed by the NSW Liberal party. \n\"I have asked the party to investigate these claims. If any allegations of wrongdoing emerge, they will be referred to the NSW Electoral Commission,\" she said. \n\"The NSW Government takes the issue of political donations very seriously and has taken a number of steps in recent years to improve transparency and accountability.\" \nFairfax Media understands the allegations were initially raised by Liberal opponents of Mr Williams in a bid to prevent him being given a ministry prior to Ms Berejiklian announcing her cabinet reshuffle last month. \nIt has been alleged that Mr Williams, who is aligned with the centre right faction, was appointed to cabinet over left-winger John Sidoti in a factional deal linked to preselection for the North Sydney byelection. \nLast year the NSW Liberal party was forced to forgo almost $600,000 in public funding after political donations equal to that amount were deemed by the electoral commission to have been unlawful following an investigation into its fundraising before the 2011 election. \nMr Williams was not involved in that investigation.
