Mapped: The countries with the most public holidays \nT he welcome bonus is the second to have been gifted to Brits this year, after the Yuletide period saw Christmas Day and New Years Day fall on a Sunday. \nIt meant that those employees normally required to book the festive period off work were able to save the days for later in the year. \nAfter this year’s festivities, those hoping to enjoy the same length of time off work will have to wait until 2019, when Good Friday falls on 19 April.
