Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The Scottish government has committed to increasing the amount of woodland in Scotland \nThe letter states: \"Our concern is whether adequate weight is being given to the significant changes this will have on the landscape of Scotland and in particular the dramatic open views and vistas which have come to signify to the outside world that which is unique about our country. \n\"Until a vision and strategy for Scotland's uplands is in place, there is an obvious failure to join up what is required from the land to meet forestry targets and what we might want to keep in terms of internationally rare and valuable landscapes and ecosystems.\" \nThe two organisations are calling for an urgent policy statement which protects moorlands. \nNeil Reid, from Mountaineering Scotland, told BBC Scotland: \"It is a serious issue for both of us and that's why we have come together in this way. \n\"There are many things we do disagree about, and will continue to disagree about, but the key thing is that we both need a coherent policy and an overall vision for the landscape of Scotland.\" Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Both the groups say they are not completely opposed to planting more trees, but want sites to be chosen with care \nThe group, which represents hill walkers and mountaineers, wants moorland areas to be left untouched as a wild landscape for tourists. \nThose tourists, they argue, are an important contributor to the local economy. \nMr Reid added: \"They talk about this landscape, they don't talk about going for miles long wanders through woods. \n\"You can see the hills around you, you see the shape of the landscape and it's also relatively benign for walking across.\" \nThe two groups have invited the Scottish government to share its thinking on the relative value placed on woodland and moorland. \nGamekeeper Bob Connelly said: \"Heather heathland is one of the rarer types of habitat in the world. Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Ecologist James Fenton says moorland should be protected not disparaged \n\"We, in Britain, have a very large percentage of it and to cover it in trees is just ecological vandalism.\" \nBoth groups emphasise that they are not opposed to tree planting but that sites have to be well chosen. \nEcologist Dr James Fenton, who has written a document called \"A Future for Moorland in Scotland\" for the SGA, has echoed the calls for moorland protection. \nHe said: \"It's disparaged rather than being recognised as important so they'd be quite happy to get rid of our finest landscape. \n\"[We would] lose them by attrition, one bit is lost to trees here or a dam there or a wind farm there and we are just losing our wild, wide open spaces which characterise Scotland, and that concerns me.\" \nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"The increased woodland creation targets announced by the Scottish government as part of its Climate Change Plan will be taken forward in a sustainable way, including working closely with a range of stakeholders. \n\"This will include appropriate consideration of Scotland's distinctive upland landscapes.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:37:25.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
