If you want me to do it, I will do it.’” \nAdele, 28, added: “When the video came out, I was blown away by how f–king hot he was.” \n“It is exceptional how good looking he was.” She also said George, whose hits included “Faith” and “Father Figure,” influenced her with his views on life and fame. \nShe said: “I found him one of the ­truest icons, because when people are that famous there is not fakeness in a bad way but they put on an alter ego to protect themselves, and rightly so.” \n“I understand and appreciate that.” \nAdele became the first star to win best ­record, song and album twice at the Grammys in Los Angeles last Sunday. \nBut now she is back to the day job and has arrived Down Under to perform to her Australian fans. \nSmiling happily, the singer was spotted exiting a huge private jet with her baby. \nThe singer was seen arriving in Sydney ahead of the next gigs planned on her world tour.
