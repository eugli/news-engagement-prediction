Police had to intervene in order to prevent clashes between the group and foreign nationals.\nMbeki also focussed his address on the current higher education crisis, saying he would await the outcome of the fees commission before sharing his thoughts on solutions to the problem.\nHe also said that police had an obligation to act on complaints brought to them by communities.\n\"When our communities discover or suspect criminal activities in their areas, regardless of the nationality of the alleged criminal or criminals, they must report this to the police service,\" said Mbeki.\nThe former statesman said South Africans should not make the mistake of committing the offence of viewing or characterising African migrants in the country as criminals.\n''We cannot now behave in a manner that treats other fellow Africans who are now residents in the country as enemies or unwelcomed guests,'' he said.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=162940150&t=artid%3df7ed0fbe-19e5-4ab2-b8c3-c056b088cbf2%26Companies%3dunisa%26People%3dthabo+mbeki%26Places%3dpretoria%26Topics%3dxenophobia%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=162940150&t=artid%3df7ed0fbe-19e5-4ab2-b8c3-c056b088cbf2%26Companies%3dunisa%26People%3dthabo+mbeki%26Places%3dpretoria%26Topics%3dxenophobia%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1"], "published": "2017-02-27T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:14:44.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
