Photo: Professor Kamal Alameh has been working with ClearVue Technologies' chairman Victor Rosenberg to create the product, which has been five years in the making. (ABC Rural: Michelle Stanley) \nCompany chairman Victor Rosenberg said the glass would provide farmers \"safety and security of product\" and reduce the need for chemicals. \n\"With a closed environment under good controlled conditions, we want to get to the point where we can actually reduce the use of pesticides, fungicides and any other of the chemicals that are used because at the end of the day you do swallow them and you do eat them,\" he said. \n\"Safety and security to me is prime.\" \nThere are currently similar products on the market and still in development, but according to Professor Kamal, the solar-glass developed at ESRI was the only energy harvesting glass that was also clear. \n\"There are other technologies that embed solar cells into the glass, so they are not fully transparent, or you could say they are partially opaque,\" he said. \nProfessor Kamal said the solar-glass produced roughly 35 watts of energy per square metre of glass, which he believed was sufficient due to the amount of visible light the plants would receive. \nESRI has received a $1.6 million grant from the Federal Government's Cooperative Research Centre, which will fund a 300 square metre trial greenhouse to be built in the Perth area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:15:29.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
