Media: MediaOS Video \nThe 75th anniversary of Executive Order 9066, ordering internment of Japanese-Americans living on the West Coast, was marked in Seattle with a blunt message by Muslim, Japanese-American, faith and political leaders. \n\"We can't let this happen again,\" Tom Ikeda, director of Densho, a grassroots organization dedicated to preserving the story of World War II, incarceration, told a crowd of more than 1,300 who turned out for a \"Never Again\" meeting at the Seattle Center. \nThe Rev. Natch Ohno, a Jesuit priest, asked an interfaith service at nearby Seattle First United Methodist Church: \"What other class is vulnerable, today, to the discrimination and hate that seems to be part of our dialogue today.\" \nJapanese-Americans in the Seattle area were treated as pariahs after President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the infamous internment order on Feb. 19, 1942. \"Seventy five years ago, we didn't have this kind of support,\" said Ikeda, looking out at the crowd. \nPictures of the era show Japanese-American truck farmers trudging down to the dock on Bainbridge Island, allowed to take only what they could carry or cart. Broadway High School suddenly lost 30 percent of its students.

They were initially held in shacks at a muddy Puyallup fairgrounds called Camp Harmony. It was then off to the hot, dusty Minidoka internment camp in southern Idaho. \nThey were on hand at Seattle Center to lend a hand in understanding what happened to 110,000 people, 80,000 of them American citizens. \n\"It was stuck in the desert with barbed wire,\" said Frank Nishimura. Nishimura was fortunate in that his family bought inland land near Spokane, and ws spared internment. But they did the long drive to Minidoka. \nTosh Okamoto, who would go on to co-found Seattle World School, was interned at Tule Lake in California, and later Heart Mountain in Wyoming. \n\"I am here primarily because for a long time I was ashamed to have been put in a prison,\" said Okamoto. \"We didn't want to talk about it. We were Americans but (there was) all the hurt we had.\" \nTwo currents of opinion seemed to run against each other at the Seattle Center on Sunday afternoon. \nThe first is that the United States has officially acknowledged that E.O. 9066 was a tragic mistake. \nThe Civil Liberties Act of 1988 -- Seattle's U.S. Rep. Mike Lowry was a prime sponsor -- granted $20,000 in reparations and a presidential apology to each camp survivor. A total of 82,219 survivors and heirs received redress. \nThe William Kenzo Nakamura United States Courthouse in Seattle is named for an internee who was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for defending his platoon on the Italian front in World War II, an action in which he was killed. \nA Seattle man who fought internment through the federal courts, Gordon Hirabayashi, is honored with a campground and rest areas on Mt. Lemmon outside Tucson, the site of the internment camp to which he ultimately had to report. \nThe National Park Service now looks after memorials at Tule Lake in California, and on Bainbridge Island. \nTosh Okamoto is amazed at the change seen in his lifetime, saying with pride: This is still the greatest country in the world. I am proud to be an American.\" \nThe other current of opinion is nothing in which to take pride. It consists of the immigration bans, potential deportation orders and ICE raids being unleashed by the Trump Administration, and the President's incendiary anti-Muslim rhetoric -- and its multiple untruths. \n\"Today reminds us that we have been here before,\" Mayor Ed Murray told the crud. \"We have been here before as a city. We have been here before when Japanese-American farmers could no longer be found at the Pike Place Market. \n\"We aren't going back,\" added Hizzoner. \nWhat to do? Question authority of the Trump administration, and carry that questioning beyond the liberal precincts of Seattle, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., urged. \"Our dissent is the most patriotic thing we can do: We cannot let the abnormal be normalized,\" said Jayapal. \nArsalan Bukhari, with the Council on American Islamic Relations, wondered aloud how the patriotism of American Muslims can be questioned when 10,000 Muslims are currently service in the U.S. armed forces. \nThe 442nd Regiment, composed almost entirely of Japanese Americans, fought in Italy, helping break through the Germans' Gustav Line late in World War II. It became the most decorated unit for its size and length of service in the history of the U.S. Army. \nBut the stigmatizing of Muslims, in the White House and often the media, has raised the possibility of another round of roundups, and another \"natural security\"-justified trampling of rights under the U.S. Constitution. \nThe fear unleashed against Japanese Americans during World War II raged up and down the West Coast. Canada interned Japanese-Canadian citizens. \nEven liberal U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas voted to uphold internment in the case of Korematsu v. United States.. U.S. Rep. Henry Jackson, later a Senate champion of human rights, warned that the \"disciples of Bushido\" were moving to control the restaurant industry on the West Coast. \nThe memories of a disastrous mistake must not be lost, lest it be repeated. \nA Canadian internment camp was located in the Selkirk Mountains of southeast British Columbia ear Slocan Lake. \nDecades after World War II, a group of hikers from Seattle encountered famed Canadian TV host/scientist (\"The Nature of Things\") David Suzuki, his aged father, and three teenage Suzukis in heavy metal T-shirts at New Denver, B.C. Suzuki, as a little boy, and his father were interned at the camp. \nWhy was a bevy of Suzukis headed for the almost unrecognizable site of a World War II internment camp. \"They need to know what happened, what can happen,\" David Suzuki said, pointing at his progeny.
