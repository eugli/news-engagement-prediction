So we're not going to stop,\" Cullen said. \nThe group said all the police charges fell over, either for lack of evidence, or because the group weren't actually trespassing. \n\"[It was] public land, which we knew at the time,\" one said. \nPolice have been approached for comment. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:22:37.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
