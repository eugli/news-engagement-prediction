AP Photo/Evan Vucci \nBillionaire businessman Mark Cuban hinted Monday that he may choose to seek the presidency in the future. \n\"We will see,\" Cuban told Business Insider in an email. \nCuban was responding to a question that stemmed from his Sunday back-and-forth with President Donald Trump, when the president tweeted he did not believe Cuban was \"smart enough\" to run for the nation's highest office. \nCuban fired back three tweets to Trump, initially just writing \"Lol.\" In that string of tweets, the owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks and star of ABC's \"Shark Tank\" posted a pair of emails he sent to Trump. \nOne of the emails made public by Cuban contained an interesting line regarding his potential future candidacy, which has been speculated on for years. In it, he suggested he \"may go after that job someday and it could be against [Trump].\" \nHow soon they forget .... pic.twitter.com/VXcfnjj4qX — Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 12, 2017 \nCuban said early on in the presidential cycle that he was considering a future presidential bid, but he shot the idea down a number of times later on in the campaign. At the first presidential debate in late September, Cuban said there was \"no possible way\" he'd run. \n\"There's just no way,\" Cuban, who became a prominent backer and surrogate for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, said . \"And put up with that shinola show? Are you kidding me? There's just no way that I would put my family through that. Just no chance.\" Another interesting tidbit from the Sunday back-and-forth was that Trump's initial tweet followed a New York Post story from earlier in the day on how his team is planning ahead for his 2020 reelection effort. And sources told the Post that the idea of Cuban seeking the presidency and challenging Trump is the White House's \"biggest fear\" because he would have similar outsider appeal to Republicans and independents. \"He’s not a typical candidate,\" one insider told the Post. \"He appeals to a lot of people the same way Trump did.\" \"If you believe in the Trump revolution, you can believe a candidate like Mark Cuban could win an election,\" the source added. \"And Mark is the kind of guy who would drop half a billion dollars of his own money on the race.\" In recent weeks, after laying off of Trump following his electoral victory, Cuban has returned to hammering the president on social media and in TV interviews. Cuban took aim at Trump for his implementation of the travel ban, taking a more openly critical position toward it than any prominent executive. \n\"I've been crushing POTUS,\" he wrote on Twitter in late January. \"He has earned it.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T22:06:09.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
