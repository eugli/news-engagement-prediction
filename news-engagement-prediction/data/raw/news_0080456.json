Photo: Andrew Meares \nMs Hanson later said: \"I do have a problem with his religion if he's actually a fundamentalist and follows the Koran to the letter, which I think denigrates women.\" \nUnder questioning from Greens leader Richard Di Natale, Mr Fahour said Senator Hanson's comments were \"ill-informed\" and that his faith was a private matter. Advertisement \n\"I felt really sad for the Senator that she would descend to that level of commentary,\" he said. \nMr Fahour said her comments were \"quite hurtful\" to his wife and four children. \n\"We came here legitimately, we assimilated, and we love being in this country,\" he said. \n\"I love this country so much. \n\"I feel sorry for Senator Hanson that she feels the need to say those things about someone whose 100 per cent objective is to do the right thing for the country . . . It's with a very heavy heart I hear those comments and think how sad it is.\" \nMr Fahour contrasted Senator Hanson with the other \"honorable, decent and caring\" senators from all parties who had questioned him over the years at Senate hearings. \nNeither Ms Hanson nor any other One Nation senators have attended Tuesday's hearings to ask questions of Mr Fahour. \nWhen announcing his resignation last week, Mr Fahour took a swipe at Senator Hanson by saying Australia Post was a considerably more complex business to run than a fish and chip shop. \nAustralia Post has now published a detailed breakdown of its executive pay on its website. \nMr Stanhope defended Mr Fahour's salary although he acknowledged it was now \"inconsistent with community expectations\". \n\"We need our salary packages to be commercially competitive to attract and retain talented people in a competitive, executive talent market,\" he said. \nMr Stanhope said Australia Post faced a \"dilemma\" because the salary of its chief executive will now be set by the independent Remuneration Tribunal . \nOnly time will tell if the salary is set at a high enough level to attract the talent the company needs, he said. \nCommunications Minister Mitch Fifield said he was not aware of Mr Fahour's salary until it was revealed earlier this month, though he did know Mr Fahour was \"well remunerated\". \nMr Stanhope said Malcolm Turnbull had raised concerns about Mr Fahour's salary early in his tenure as communications minister and that he had explained why he felt the remuneration was appropriate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:00:42.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
