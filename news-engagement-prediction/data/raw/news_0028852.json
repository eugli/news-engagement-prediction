The usual chocolates? Flowers? Dinner?\nWhat about puja? Once you hear what it is, it might sound a little risqué. But for some singles and couples, it might be a perfect way to connect during the day of romance.\nAdvertisement\nLexington resident Robyn Vogel, founder of  Come Back to Love , leads puja circles in Greater Boston and elsewhere. Participants can learn to remove obstacles to intimacy (not their clothes, there’s no nudity) and find sparks of the divine —and love — in their partners, strangers, and most deeply, within themselves.\nUsed by Hindus and Buddhists as part of a sacred practice, a puja shows reverence to a god, a spirit, or another aspect of the divine through invocations, prayers, and rituals.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here A psychotherapist and certified sex coach, Vogel said she has witnessed many clients in her 15 years of practice struggling in relationships, feeling lost around love, and craving passionate connections.\n“Whether a person is in a relationship or not, being seen and known by someone else is powerful,” she said. “It’s something people crave.”\nKate Duffy, 54, of Shirley, and her partner of two years, Tim Carpenter, 51, of Fitchburg, were willing to give it a try. Both are divorcees with adult children.\nAdvertisement\nBefore attending Vogel’s puja circle at the Watertown Center for Healing Arts, Carpenter was “closed off” and distanced himself when thing were not going well in their relationship, he said. Through the pujas, “You realize by opening up that it’s not always going to hurt you.”\nIntimacy exercises, as simple as eye gazing, deep listening, or face stroking, can be unsettling for some. To ensure establishing a safe space, Vogel makes clear that participants set their own boundaries with a “yes,” “no,” or “maybe.”\nThe first portion of the night began with light, playful ways for all participants to mingle and connect, starting with dancing. During the break, a picnic-like feast of fresh fruit, rich chocolates, and nuts reenergized the group.\nBefore the second portion of intimacy exercises, couples decided whether they’d participate only with their partners in the inner circle or shuffle to others in the outer circle.\nIntimacy exercises take place standing up or sitting comfortably. The impact is immediate and heartfelt.\n“As a couple, you’re staring into each other’s eyes,” said Carpenter, “and as the circle progresses, you feel the connection deepening. It’s amazing to me.”\nDuffy said telling others about their participation has “raised an eyebrow” or two.\n“Years ago, I would’ve been like that,” she said.\nNina Manolson, and her husband, Kyle Russell, both 52, live in Somerville with their two teen daughters and will be celebrating their 20th anniversary in July. Two years ago, they began attending the puja circles together.\n“We’re both working, plus focused on our kids and community,” Manolson said. “Sometimes our relationship, which is the foundation, gets put to the side.” The pujas help them reconnect, she said.\n“We walk in on that ‘go-go’ mechanical mode and leave holding hands, feeling warm and fuzzy, with my life partner on my side,” Manolson said. “Just as our house needs a new roof to feel safe, it’s the same with a marriage. You repair things when they’re broken, upgrade appliances. You work on things that make the relationship go.”\nPaul Cooperstein, 63, an attorney from Quincy and self-described “divorced guy” after a 20-year marriage, said he went to his first puja about four years ago and, most recently, a four-day event in Puerto Rico.\n“To be touched, physically, but also emotionally and spiritually, what a sweet and beautiful way to connect with other human beings,” he said. “We’re spiritual beings in a human body. This puja experience is one piece of that.”\nMilton resident, Laura Sauter, a graphic designer in her 40s and divorced mother of two teen daughters, said she has never gone to a puja circle with a partner, but plans to bring a man she’s dating to an upcoming event.\nSouter cautioned that the conservative crowd might find the nontraditional pujas a little “woo-woo.”\n“But worlds can get shared in a moment,” she said. “You fall in love with yourself. How could you be afraid of that?”\nJustin Saglio for the Boston Globe\n“Whether a person is in a relationship or not, being seen and known by someone else is powerful,” says Robyn Vogel, leading a puja circle in Watertown.\nWorld record love connection Want to help set a Guinness Book of World Records for the Largest Ever Intimate Puja Circle?\nJoin Robyn Vogel Saturday, Feb. 18, from 6:30 to 10:30 p.m. at the Center for the Arts at the Armory, 191 Highland Ave., Somerville.\nCost is $45 per person.
