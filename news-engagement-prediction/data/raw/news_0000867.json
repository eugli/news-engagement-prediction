He told Kimmel it was for a new role (rumor has it Dornan is filming a gritty Robin Hood ) and that he knew he could pull it off because he has a round head. We’d argue that he can also pull it off because A.) he used to be a Calvin Klein underwear model, and B.) because the look is extremely well balanced. \nNailing the right beard-to-hair ratio is mostly a matter of making sure you don’t lean too hard in one direction with both your strands and your scruff—long, short, highly groomed, unkempt, what have you. Dornan’s shaved head is military tidy, so his longer, less manicured beard works well. It also shows off his ability to grow some bitchin’ facial hair, which, if you’re a guy who is starting to thin or recede on top, is just a smart play. And it helps him not feel like a shaved cat in the frigid winter weather—always a bonus. \nIf you decided to grow a beard this winter and feel yourself itching to shave it all off, go to the bathroom and take the clippers to your dome instead. You won’t have to worry about whether your haircut is cool enough, and you’ll look a bit like Dornan here; an underwear model turned movie star with a disproportionate number of female fans. Well, not really. But you’ll definitely look like a supremely handsome version of yourself, which is something.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:21:11.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
