My last defeat on TV was against Phil Taylor in September, but I want to keep pressure on myself.\" Taylor was held to a thrilling draw by Wade \nIn a repeat of the 2009 Premier League final, six-time champion Phil Taylor was forced to settle for a share of the spoils against James Wade in a thrilling 6-6 draw which kept him top of the standings. \n'The Power' looked to be on his way to sealing maximum points when he nailed a show-stopping 142 checkout to take a 6-5 lead, but two 140s enabled Aldershot thrower Wade to take control of the final leg before landing tops for the draw. \n\"I was kicking myself,\" said Wade, who averaged 98.88. \"Phil has cost me a lot of money and I hate him, but he's actually a nice guy. It would be a great shame for darts [if he retires]. It will be a weird world without Phil Taylor in it. Anderson flew past Klaasen with an impressive display \nTwo-time Premier League champion Gary Anderson proved too strong for former Lakeside winner Jelle Klaasen completing a majestic 7-3 victory. \n'The Flying Scotsman', who averaged 100, said: \"I pinched the win. It's a long game, but I need to work on my finishing for next week.\" Lewis was in ruthless mood on the oche against Chizzy \nTwo-time former world champion Adrian Lewis secured his first win with an impressive 7-2 annihilation of Dave Chisnall. \nThe Stoke thrower lost a 4-1 advantage to lose 7-5 to Raymond van Barneveld in Newcastle last Thursday, but was back to his clinical best against an out-of-form 'Chizzy' finishing with a 94.43 three-dart average and 54 per cent on the doubles. \n\"It wasn't really a good game. I let myself down last week which was very frustrating, but it's swings and roundabouts in darts,\" said Jackpot, who landed a cracking 160 checkout in the seventh leg. Honours even between Barney and The Hurricane \nBelgian ace Kim Huybrechts held 2014 Premier League champion Van Barneveld to a 6-6 draw in a match which featured six breaks of throw. \n\"Both of us could have won it and both of us maybe think we should have won it,\" said Huybrechts. \"I think we're both happy with that. \n\"It could have been more points but it could have been less as well because Barney had a couple of darts to go 5-3 up, so at the end I think a draw is maybe fair.\" \nWho will win the Premier League?
