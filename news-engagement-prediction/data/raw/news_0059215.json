However, these matters are not of recent origin. \nThe Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) has been communicating with the Health Ministry on the issue of inadequately trained and motivated new medical graduates for several years now. \nOur reason for concern was primarily the rapid expansion of private and, to some extent, public medical colleges. While in the bad old days many exemplary students could not enter medical school, it seems to us that now there are many studying medicine who have less than stellar academic results and some who are not really interested in the field. \nThis combination means that there will be a higher proportion of new doctors who are inadequately prepared for the gruelling “vocational training” course that is housemanship. \nAs we feared, the Health Ministry has been experiencing increasing problems with some house officers. The bureaucracy involved makes it difficult to dismiss those who do not perform adequately. For this and other reasons, house officers and junior medical officers are now employed on a contract basis. Non-perfor­mance may result in termination of the contract. \nThe letter by Datuk Dr Musa Mohd Nordin, “Grappling with housemen woes” ( The Star , Feb 21), looks in depth at many of the issues. The MMA is glad to learn that the Islamic Medical Association of Malaysia (Imam) is holding courses for housemen. But it appears that Dr Musa is not aware the MMA, through its government doctors’ wing, has also been holding courses on “Rights and Responsibilities of Government Doctors” all over the country and “Housemanship Survival Skills” for several years now. The latter is primarily aimed at fresh graduates who are waiting for jobs. \nThere are many other activities which our Section Concerning House Officers, Medical Officers and Specialist (SCHOMOS) have done throughout the years, such as Program Transformasi Minda which provides exposure and adaptive mind in the early stages of the appointment of officials in the government sector. \nWe’ve also held regular meetings with house officers during Continuous Professional Development (CPD) talks, conducted seminars to create a pathway to address issues related to SCHOMOS, organised interstate sport activities among government doctors and, last but not least, published a SCHOMOS handbook to provide advice and guidance for house officers. \nThe MMA agrees with Dr Musa that sweeping statements denigrating whole groups are unhelpful. However, this does not mean there are no serious problems affecting a significant portion of our junior doctors. These problems have the potential to result in patients receiving suboptimal care. \nSince laymen will not have the expertise to easily discern when they are being inadequately cared for, it is the responsibility of the profession to solve these problems. The MMA will therefore continue with its own initiatives to help housemen and will also work closely with the Health Ministry on these matters. \nDR JOHN CHEW CHEE MING \nPresident", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:34:05.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
