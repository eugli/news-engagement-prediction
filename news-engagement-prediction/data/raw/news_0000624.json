Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. The infamous island green of the par-three 17th hole on Sawgrass's Stadium course. Story highlights Phoenix Open's 16th is a gladiatorial arena Island green 17th is highlight of TPC Sawgrass (CNN) Sometimes size isn't everything, and in golf a good little 'un can often beat a good big 'un. Of the thousands of golf holes in all the world, a handful of treacherous tiddlers stand out. From Augusta to New Zealand, CNN Sport has scoured the world for 12 of the best par threes on the planet. 17th hole, Stadium Course, TPC Sawgrass, Florida Read More Think Players Championship, think the island green 17th. This 137-yard flick on the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass looks innocent enough but the water befuddles tired minds and acts as magnet to balls. During the 2015 Players, 45 balls found the drink -- but there was a different kind of hazard in 1998 when a seagull picked up Steve Lowery's ball and flew off before dropping it in the water. \"It tricks you into thinking it's a real difficult hole when it's just a short iron. But we're human, so we think about the bad stuff,\" Bubba Watson told reporters in 2011. 7th hole, Pebble Beach Golf Links, California Intimate but intimidating, the 106-yard seventh at Pebble Beach is one of golf's most iconic holes. This California classic plunges from an elevated tee down to a green perched above the crashing waves of Monterey Bay and the Pacific Ocean beyond. \"If I had only one more round to play, I would choose to play it at Pebble Beach,\" says Jack Nicklaus. \"I've loved this course from the first time I saw it. It's possibly the best in the world.\" Actor Bill Murray thought it a good idea to follow his ball with his club at the seventh in the Pebble Beach pro-am event in February.

One of his most notable changes is a new par-three ninth, from the old ninth tee across the bay to a green nearer the foot of the lighthouse.
