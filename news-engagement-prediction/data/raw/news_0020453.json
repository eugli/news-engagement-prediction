Michael Walters was behind the motion to reinstate and improve the community sand box program.\n\"Restore the sand,\" he urged his fellow councillors Monday.\nCoun. Bev Esslinger wanted to know if it was possible to expand the program to communities who didn't have sand boxes before.\nCoun. Ben Henderson said the program has become even more important in the city in the last two to three years, with the increasing frequency of rain and freezing rain.\nHe wants to see some improvements, though, in how the city refills the boxes.\nA complaint frequently heard about the sand boxes is that they were often empty.\n\"We need something better than we had before,\" Henderson said.\nMayor Don Iveson asked if administration would look at bringing back the program this winter, given that there are likely months of snow and ice ahead.\nJones said the program will be reinstated in the next couple of weeks. But the administration will look for a better way to deal with slippery city sidewalks next winter.\n\"We had some pretty nasty conditions a couple of weeks ago, and sand is probably not the best option for some of those,\" he said. \"We will look at different things. There's lots of options that are available to us and we're exploring those.\"\nThe city is also starting a pilot project, he said, using de-icers on the Yellowhead, Gateway Boulevard and Calgary Trail, as well as sidewalks the city maintains downtown.\nThat project will begin Feb.15 and last until the end of the winter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:53:26.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
