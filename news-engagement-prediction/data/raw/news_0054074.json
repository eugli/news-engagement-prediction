At an average of $500 billion in output a year, removing all such immigrants would be like lopping off the equivalent of Massachusetts from the U.S. economy, said study co-author Francesc Ortega . \n2) Only in the delusional world inhabited by Trump and his rabid nativist supporters are immigrants more dangerous than native-born Americans. \nThe NYT writes : “ Research shows lower levels of crime among immigrants than among native-born Americans.” \nAnd the Washington Post : \"Foreign-born individuals exhibit remarkably low levels of involvement in crime across their life course.\" (Bianca Bersani, University of Massachusetts, 2014. Published in Justice Quarterly .)” Pew graph created in 2013 based on Bersani’s work. \n3) Stripping immigrants of basic privacy protections has not gone over well with judges \nDear Trump: Please note the use of \"any person\" in the 14th Amendment , something Maricopa County Sherriff Joe Arpaio failed to absorb while he was violating it. \nNo state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. \nAs the ACLU notes : Once here, \" even undocumented immigrants have the right to freedom of speech and religion, the right to be treated fairly, the right to privacy, and the other fundamental rights U.S. citizens enjoy.\" \n4) Hiring 15,000 new border agents is not quite as easy as it sounds \nFrom an NPR interview with James Tomsheck , former head of internal affairs for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, who helped double the border force from 10,000 to about 21,000 between 2006 and 2012: \nWe received authorization to institute a polygraph screening program and ran those first exams in February of 2008, towards the end of the initial Border Patrol hiring. [...] The results were shocking. More than half of the applicants failed to clear the exam, with the overwhelming majority giving us detailed admissions as to why it was they failed the exam. It was what these applicants had done in their past that most concerned us. They included serious felony crimes, active involvement in smuggling activities and several confirmed infiltrators who actually were employed by drug trafficking organizations who had been directed to seek out positions within Customs and Border Protection to advance ongoing criminal conspiracies, essentially be spies in our midst. [...] \nThe reality is the hiring initiative, time and time again, visited southwest border communities over the course of those two years and four months that that initial hiring initiative moved forward. At some point in time, the quality of the applicant pool sharply declined. And yet, the mandate to double the size of the Border Patrol remained in progress. \nTomsheck essentially said that the only way to fill 15,000 positions quickly would be to lower standards and/or \"dilute the effectiveness of the polygraph program or, in some instances, actually obtain waivers.\" \n5) Good luck enlisting Mexico to hold asylum seekers within their borders until their claims can be reviewed by U.S. courts \nPart of the new effort to \"discourage asylum seekers\" involves Mexican officials, out of the good of their hearts, holding people within Mexico until such time as their asylum claims can be processed by U.S. officials. White House press secretary Sean Spicer has high hopes because U.S.-Mexico relations are just stellar. x \nNBC: Why is Tillerson going to Mexico? Is this a clean-up job?Spicer: \"No. The relationship with Mexico is phenomenal right now.\" \nLOL. Or another perspective from NPR's Carrie Kahn : \nThe cooperation and the coordination that you need from Mexico to pull this off would have to be great. And Mexico - I can just tell you that Mexico is not in any mood to help the U.S. lately, given the hostile relationships that they're having. And it's just something that's not going to go over well with Mexicans. \nIn sum, Trump’s deportation policies are wrong on the economy, wrong on safety, wrong on the Constitution, wrong on safety once again, and downright laughable on Mexico.
