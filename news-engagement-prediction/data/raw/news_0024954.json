Why are they (Congress) so troubled with this? Fun, pun, repartee and exchange of mild or strong words are a part of parliamentary convention. \n“Congress has two set of leaders. Ones who come from the family are beyond criticism. They cannot make a mistake. Second set of leaders are those who are used for political convenience and then discarded. Manmohan Singh also has his utility... Those outside the family are useful, expendable entities,” he said.

The so called credibility of Singh was abused by the dynasty to promote corruption and rank cronyism,” he said. \nCongress leaders compared Modi with “abhorrent” rulers and showered abuses on him, he said and referred to remarks like ‘Maut ke saudagar’, made by Sonia Gandhi when Modi was Gujarat Chief Minister, and ‘khoon ki dalali’, Rahul Gandhi’s barb at Modi following surgical strikes. \nClaiming that Modi set an “example in humility” by noting contributions of former prime ministers in his August 15 speech from the Red Fort, Prasad said he showed his “big heart” by never launching a witch-hunt despite the “conspiracies” hatched against him when he was Gujarat chief minister. \nPrasad said that Singh despite being the then Prime Minister could not save his “guru” PV Narasimha Rao from insult even in his death as the Gandhi family did not allow his body to be taken inside the Congress headquarters. \n“He has his own utility. I feel pity for him... This is his tragedy,” he told a press conference. \nThe Rao government accorded Bharat Ratna to Sardar Patel and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad in 1991 and 1992. “Was this the reason for the manner in which they treated Rao?” he asked.
