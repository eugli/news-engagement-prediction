'He is dangerous': Brother Craig said. \n“He’s dangerous, at times he is dangerous,” Hackett’s brother Craig said. \n“He’s a danger to himself, he’s a danger to the community, and poor mum and dad who’ve tried to look after him so much.” \nHackett came out of retirement leading up to the 2016 Rio Olympics but failed to qualify for the games.

He’s big and powerful when he’s not happy,” Nev Hackett told the Gold Coast Bulletin. \n“We decided he needed some treatment but there was no way he was going to go and get treatment this morning so we called the police. \n“It’s what I’d call a bit of a breakdown.” His father described it as 'a bit of a breakdown'.

Hackett's fall from grace \nSince his retirement from professional swimming in 2008, Hackett's turbulent personal life has been the subject of much scrutiny. \nIn 2011, he upended a grand piano as he trashed the luxury penthouse he shared with his then-wife Candice Alley. \nThe couple separated the following year following a drunken night out after the Logies, which resulted in a bitter custody battle over their two children. \nIn 2014, Hackett's mental health again came into question when he appeared half-naked and searching for his son at the Crown Casino in Melbourne. \nThe 36-year-old was back in the headlines in April 2016 after he was involved in a mid-flight drunken incident . An admittedly drunken Hackett was pictured in a wheel chair after being taken into custody at Melbourne airport.

Grant Hackett's 'nipple tweak' victim not to press charges after in-flight altercation \n“I seriously and genuinely regret my poor behaviour,\" the swimmer said at the time, admitting that he would undergo anger management counselling. \n\"I have stuffed up more than once and am working on these issues. It is embarrassing to hear and read the consequences of my actions.\" \nIf you or someone you know is struggling mentally contact Lifeline for support on 131114.
