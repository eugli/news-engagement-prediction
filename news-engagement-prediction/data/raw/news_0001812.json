Analysts expected earnings of $1.30 per share, and revenue of $8.5 billion.\n\nFacebook's biggest money-maker continues to be mobile advertising, with 84% of all advertising revenue now coming from mobile ads, compared to 80% a year ago.\n\nRelated Facebook Ordered to Pay $500 Million in Oculus Lawsuit\n\nEqually impressive are Facebook's usage numbers: The social network attracted 1.23 billion daily active users in December on average, including 1.15 billion mobile daily actives, with the latter being up 23% year-over-year.  \nAnd 1.74 billion of Facebook's 1.86 billion monthly active users were on mobile devices for at least some of their visits.\n\nInterestingly, Facebook sees most of its growth outside of the U.S. these days. Daily active users only grew by 6.5% year-over-year in the U.S., but by 28% in Asia.  \nAt the same time, Facebook was able to significantly grow its revenue for U.S. users, from $3 billion in Q4 of 2015 to $4.6 billion in Q4 of 2016.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg used the company's earnings call to once again stress the importance of video, calling it a \"mega-trend.\"  \nHowever, he said that the company isn't putting too much of an emphasis on long-form video content any time soon, and instead called short-form video \"the primary focus for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nAsked about virtual reality, Zuckerberg reiterated that it will take time for that market to mature, ruling out any profits in the near term. He did praise Samsung for shipping 5 million Gear VR headsets, which are powered by Facebook's Oculus software.  But also acknowledged that Oculus has had its share of troubles last year, calling the delay of both the Rift headset and the Touch controller \"a little disappointing.\"\n\nInterestingly, investors didn't have a single question about the $500 million verdict against Oculus and some of its officers that a Texas jury handed down just minutes before the company reported its earnings on Wednesday. \nOculus separately announced its intent to appeal the ruling Wednesday afternoon. - Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:35:40.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
