The SkyTrain is the rapid transit route connecting the Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster and Surrey. \nTakahashi’s other parole conditions include staying away from college or university residential areas without prior permission, not to having access to pornography or sexually explicit material, and abstaining from non-prescribed drugs or alcohol. \nThe parole board decision says overnight parole privileges were considered but were not authorized because of Takahashi’s history of failing to adhere to parole requirements in 2005 and his moderate to high risk to reoffend. \nThe board says he needs “to establish a longer period of compliance and stability” before overnight privileges can be allowed. © 2017 The Canadian Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:18:34.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
