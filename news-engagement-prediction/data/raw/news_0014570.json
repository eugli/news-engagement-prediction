LOUIS • Former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander has thrown his support behind Treasurer Tishaura Jones to be the city's next mayor. \nIn a 45-second video posted to his Twitter account, Kander talks about her work ethic and their friendship. A message to my friends in #STL about the race for Mayor. pic.twitter.com/AclCeakTXG — Jason Kander (@JasonKander) February 6, 2017 \nKander adds that Jones stands out among the field of seven Democrats, three Republicans, a Libertarian and a Green Party candidate. \n“While there are a lot of good people running, and it's really important that we have somebody that continues the progress that Mayor Slay has made, I think that person is Tishaura Jones,” Kander says. \n“She also is somebody who's taken the office of treasurer from an office that a lot of people thought maybe shouldn't be around anymore, and turned it into something that has really become essential and found new ways to provide value to the people of St. Louis,\" Kander says. \nUnder Jones, the treasurer's office launched the Office of Financial Empowerment , which seeks to help people better manage their money, and the College Kids Children's Savings Account program , which uses revenue from parking meters to help needy kids save for college. \nKander's endorsement closely follows the support Jones recently received from former St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce. \nIn a posting on NextDoor, Joyce said either Jones or 21st Ward Alderman Antonio French would be “a breath of fresh air in City Hall.” \n“I’ve worked with both and I can tell you they are both very smart and dedicated to making an impact on crime — which is a huge issue for me,” Joyce wrote. \nJoyce went on to describe why she doesn't support some of the other candidates in the race. \nJoyce described 28th Ward Alderman Lyda Krewson as the establishment candidate: “I believe we need new thinking to move forward in St. Louis. That is my problem with Lyda.” \n“I've also had great experiences with Lewis Reed and Jeffrey Boyd,” Joyce wrote. “But they may lack the level of creativity I've seen in Tishaura and Antonio. Just my two cents.” \nJoyce later took the posting down. Political Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nBe informed.
