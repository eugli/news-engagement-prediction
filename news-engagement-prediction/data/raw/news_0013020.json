USA TODAY Sports Even OLB Rob Ninkovich seemed stunned by the Patriots' Super Bowl LI victory. (Photo: Patrick Smith, Getty Images) \nHOUSTON — Fresh out of his second shower (with a champagne bath in between), Rob Ninkovich was buttoning his shirt and breaking down teammate Dont’a Hightower’s critical strip sack Sunday when the magnitude of what he’d just been a part of seemed to hit him. \nA 25-point deficit erased in a little more than a quarter. An overtime victory in Super Bowl LI. A fifth championship for the New England Patriots, who needed that turnover to really put the pressure on a young Atlanta Falcons team that seemed so in control. \n“Like, can you believe it? Like, (expletive)!” Ninkovich, the veteran linebacker who’s usually careful with his words, told USA TODAY Sports after the 34-28 win. “Who was watching that game and like, ‘Oh, yeah, the Patriots got it'? Hell no! Half the people frickin’ probably left! And our asses just stayed tough, came through, and we just won the Super Bowl. \nMORE SUPER BOWL COVERAGE Did Patriots win or Falcons choke in Super Bowl LI? \n“We won the damn Super Bowl through work, work, work, work, never saying no, never giving up, believing in each other, and now I get a second ring. It’s an unbelievable feeling, and it’s all because of all these guys.” \nNinkovich gestured toward other players in a corner of their locker room at NRG Stadium, where players chewed on cigars and popped a couple corks and laughed and cheered as they passed around the Lombardi Trophy. \n“I’m sure we’re going to go a lot harder once you’re all out of here,” defensive lineman Alan Branch said. \nFrom an outsider’s perspective, there was plainly more raw joy in that Patriots locker room than two years ago after another dramatic win, sealed by Malcolm Butler’s goal-line interception of Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson. \nWhy? Hard to say. Owner Robert Kraft alluded to Deflategate before telling the crowd “this is unequivocally the sweetest.” Star quarterback Tom Brady, who won Super Bowl MVP honors for a record fourth time, surely took some extra satisfaction from getting the last laugh on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, too. But it seemed like more than that. \nMORE PATRIOTS COVERAGE Tom Brady completes Deflategate Revenge Tour with epic Super Bowl LI comeback \nPerhaps it was that this was the embodiment of coach Bill Belichick’s “do your job” mantra. Down 28-3 after Tevin Coleman beat Ninkovich into the flat for a 6-yard touchdown with 8:31 to go in the third quarter, the Patriots had to take some gambles — a failed onside kick, a successful fourth-down conversion on the drive that began to close the gap — but really, they just kept playing. \nHightower had the big sack (on the same blitz that yielded a sack for Ninkovich in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XLIX, he said). Julian Edelman made a ground-defying catch on a tipped ball. Brady shook off a pick-six, some other misses and a beating from the Falcons defense to throw for a game record 466 yards and two scores before James White ran in the winner from the 2. \n“I’m going to have that game again, another time,” Ninkovich said. “I’m going to have to actually sit down and watch it.” \nFor now, Ninkovich said, he was going to have a beer and maybe a bourbon. Which seems like a fair enough reward for pulling off the type of comeback that he and everybody else will be trying to explain for some time. \n*** \nFollow Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelissero \nPHOTOS: Super Bowl LI Posted!
