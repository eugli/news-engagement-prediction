The non-Muslim staff are also wearing the same uniforms, but without the head scarves. \n\"At the maternity ward, fathers are now allowed to recite azan or iqamat for their newborn children, but to have only female obstetricians to handle all labour cases will not be possible for the time being as we have yet to have sufficient number of female obstetricians,\" the deputy minister said. \nDr Hilmi also stressed that all medicines and vaccines used by the ministry were also halal. \n\"Only the vaccine for rotavirus is non-halal and we did not have that. It is available only at certain private hospitals or clinics. The ministry's pharmacy department has also carried out DNA tests to ensure that the vaccines that we use are free from pork and pig derivatives. \n\"So, if the exco member wants to claim that the DAP-led Penang government would be the first to build a syariah-compliant hospital in Malaysia, I suggest that he take a look at what we have done at the ministry,\" he said. \nIt was reported that the DAP-led Penang government would build the Islamic hospital costing RM280 million in Bayan Baru and it is expected to begin operations in 2020. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T11:23:43.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
