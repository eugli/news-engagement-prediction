Manly Sydney Water’s bid to fix burst water main creates large hole at a Mona Vale corner Robbie Patterson, 22, 2017 9:07am Is this Sydney’s oldest dog? ‘You’d think I’d be sick of meat but I love it’\nA LARGE crater has opened up in a suburban street on Sydney’s northern beaches after roadworks to repair a burst water main stalled.\nThe hole, which a resident described as a “sinkhole” has spread across two lanes at the corner of Park and Maxwell streets, about 1km away from the Mona Vale town centre.\nSydney Water was doing works to repair a burst water main which occurred about 2am.\nA spokesman said the water was shut off at 3am, and they began digging but the digging stalled when the Sydney Water found a storm water pipe and gas main.\n“We need help from the (Northern Beaches) council which owns the storm water pipe and another company (AGL) before we repair the water main,” the spokesman said.\n“The ground has not subsided or collapsed at all, it is not a sinkhole. It could look bigger than it is because there is a stormwater pipe below it.”\nPark St has been closed by Sydney Water and traffic diversions have been put in place.\nVAST SINKHOLE CAUSES MAJOR BRIDGE COLLAPSE IN VLADIVOSTOK Russia: Vast sinkhole causes major bridge collapse in Vladivostok 1:05 A vast sinkhole caused a major road bridge to collapse in Vladivostok, Tuesday.
