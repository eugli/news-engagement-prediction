They’ll bus from Los Angeles to San Diego before playing in this weekend’s Tony Gwynn Classic. \nHere’s a recap of Wednesday’s win, courtesy of the Tennessee sports information department. \nSEVENTH-INNING RALLY, PITCHING PUSH VOLS PAST LMU \nLOS ANGELES — A late rally on offense and some big pitching in big spots led Tennessee to an 8-4 win at Loyola Marymount on Wednesday night in George C. Page Stadium. \nTennessee’s win over LMU in the first game between the two programs improved the Vols to 3-1 on the young season. \nFor the fourth consecutive game, Tennessee scored first to take an early lead, bringing one run across in the first. The Vols then loaded the bases in the second inning and, thanks largely to a two-run single from senior Jordan Rodgers, pushed their lead to 4-0. \nDefensive miscues by the Vols helped LMU narrow the deficit to 4-3 in the third inning, though, and then LMU designated hitter Trevin Esquerra hit a solo home run to center field to tie the game at 4-4 in the fourth inning. \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?

With out one, USC graduate transfer Reggie Southall punched a single through the left side to score Lipcius and put the Vols back in front. Two batters later, fifth-year senior Jeff Moberg drilled a double to left-center to score Southall and right fielder Dom Thornton and push Tennessee’s lead to 7-4. \nJunior Brodie Leftridge reached third base via fielder's choice and a two-base throwing error by LMU's pitcher in the ninth inning and scored on an RBI single from freshman Justin Ammons to extend the lead to 8-4, and senior closer Jon Lipinski worked a quiet bottom of the ninth to finish the win. \nBig freshman Zach Linginfelter from Knoxville-area Sevierville started on the mound for Tennessee, throwing 4.0 innings and allowing four runs (two earned) on three hits while striking out seven batters. Freshman Connor Darling made his college debut in relief of Linginfelter in the fifth, tossing a scoreless inning before California product Daniel Vasquez took the mound in the sixth. \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .) \nFreshman Garrett Stallings took the mound in a tough situation with the bases loaded an no outs in the bottom of the seventh, striking out three consecutive batters to preserve Tennessee’s lead. \nTennessee will stay in Southern California this weekend and play in the Tony Gwynn Classic in San Diego. The Vols will play Seton Hall on Friday and host San Diego State on Saturday to determine their Sunday opponent. \n\nContact Wes Rucker by email at wesrucker247@gmail.com or ON TWITTER , or FOLLOW GOVOLS247 ON FACEBOOK .
