I think: \"In that same time you have spent doing that, you could have checked your breasts\". 'It's great breast cancer sufferers and survivors have this kind of support, but we would much rather people took the time to check their breasts instead.' Ms Kerr, a life coach, was diagnosed with breast cancer in February 2011 and had her right breast fully removed via a mastectomy the following month. Survivor: Life coach Ms Kerr, pictured with daughter Laiken, was diagnosed in February 2011 Blasted: Cheryl holds up pictures of some of the celebrities who took part in the 'no make-up selfie' campaign. She said such fads fail to highlight the seriousness of breast cancer She finished her treatment in April 2016 and is set to undergo a second breast reconstruction operation later this year after an implant she was given several years ago was unsuccessful. The mother-of-one was left frustrated by the #NoMakeupSelfie challenge which swept social media in 2014, and again by a similar stunt which saw women post statuses sharing where they leave their handbag. In recent weeks Facebook feeds have been taken over by red hearts that have been shared as part of a campaign for breast cancer awareness. Passionate: Ms Kerr, pictured with Laiken, urged women to check their breasts for lumps The heart is generally accompanied by a private message to female friends asking the receiver to 'check your boobies'. However Cheryl insists this is not enough and said she is happy to lose friends over her outspoken views. She laid out her views in an impassioned video which has been viewed more than 8,000 times. 'The people who are offended by my reaction will tend to just unfriend or block me rather than say anything to me,' she said. 'It's hurt their feelings. Some people have said that they are sorry, and that they just thought that I would like it.' She added: 'I have snapped in the past, but it's because it's important. We just want you to take the time to check instead - an early diagnosis can save lives.'
