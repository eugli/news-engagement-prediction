Guardiola had Champions League football, unlike his foe over at Old Trafford, who claimed this week he is badly missing the competition. But Guardiola will be mindful of how drastically City fell away at this stage last season. He currently has a near identical record to Pellegrini after 22 games ahead of Wednesday’s trip to West Ham, the only statistic to differ is the conceding of seven more goals this time. There were additions to improve this team and how Guardiola has talked about Leroy Sane and Gabriel Jesus will serve as uplifting to supporters. Yet where it matters - at the back, as Guardiola has intimated when he’s expanded on his tactical philosophy - they are woefully short. Another window went by without strengthening in the full back areas and the Catalan must hope that does not haunt them. All four full backs are over 30 and, but perhaps for Bacary Sagna, have not hit previous heights. Kyle Walker and Danny Rose have shown there are few more important positions nowadays and the way Guardiola spoke about Tottenham this week suggests it is the vibrancy on offer to Mauricio Pochettino he craves. The only difference between Guardiola and Pellegrini is in goals conceded, where Claudio Bravo has shipped 28 between the sticks compared to Joe Hart's 21 last season ‘In the build-up Tottenham and Chelsea are the best, how they make the movements,’ Guardiola said. ‘Claudio [Bravo] has to pass good to his team-mates and when his team-mates are not in the right position he has not passed good. ‘It does not depends on Claudio, he has the quality to do that, but it depends on the others. If I want to pass there but there is no player there I cannot pass the ball there.’ Bravo has made a number of high profile mistakes in the City goal, including this error that allowed Middlesbrough to score at the Etihad Stadium The five minutes or so Guardiola broke down how this season has gone was fascinating viewing, the manager taking the blame for trying to jump ahead to the end before his team had truly mastered the basics. In hindsight, he conceded to overdoing it with chopping and changing formations, asking players to take up alien areas to them. It left them looking a little confused at times and results suffered. ‘I believed we had it [tactically],’ he added after they’d stormed to 10 consecutive wins. ‘And they [the players] did not believe we had it.’ It’d been easier to evolve had City delivered more reinforcements last summer. Critics will point towards the vast sum spent on John Stones and ask why Guardiola needed more, but the fact they tried to land Leonardo Bonucci and Aymeric Laporte makes it obvious where he felt added quality was required. This is a City defence in which Aleksandar Kolarov has started centrally on more than a few occasions, preferred to both Nicolas Otamendi and Stones.
