The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 \n\"Is it right for the president to say 'so-called' judge'? Doesn't that undermine the separation of powers in the Constitution?\" he asked.\n\"I don't think it does,\" Pence replied. \"I think the American people are very accustomed to this president speaking his mind and speaking very straight with them.\"\nThe temporary restraining order blocks the federal government from implementing a ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries.\nAccording to Pence, the federal government will challenge the Friday order by U.S. District Judge James Robart. However, the vice president did note that the judge did have the authority to stay the executive order.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner US appeals judge's order to block Trump's travel ban \nThe U.S. Justice Department is appealing a federal judge's order for a temporary nationwide restraining order on President Trump's travel ban, according to multiple reports early Saturday evening.\nAbout 24 hours after U.S. District Judge James Robart ruled Friday in favor of a lawsuit by Washington state and Minnesota, taking action against the week-old executive action, Reuters and the Associated Press reported that the Trump administration is making good on a threat to push back.\nBREAKING: U.S.\nBy Daniel Chaitin • 02/04/17 7:27 PM \"He certainly does, and that's why the administration is complying with that order as we speak. And we'll go through the process in the courts to get a stay of that order, so that, again, we can implement this action that is entirely focused on the safety and security of the American people,\" said Pence.\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced it would comply with Robart's order and, per acting press secretary Gillian Christensen, the agency \"has suspended any and all actions implementing the affected sections of the Executive Order.\"\nDHS confirmed that the Justice Department will file an emergency stay of Robart's order , a move Christensen called \"lawful and appropriate.\"\nTop  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:53:31.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
