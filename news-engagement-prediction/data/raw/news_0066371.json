Through #ReadMyLips, women—and other concerned citizens—are writing letters to Trump calling for better resources for women's health as well as greater support for survivors of sexual assault. Their efforts will culminate in early April when the letters will be stuffed inside the statue and delivered to the White House to coincide with Sexual Assault Awareness Month. \nSketches for the design of the statue; the model is currently under construction PHOTO: Mogul \nWith this campaign, participants are aiming to take a stand against the Trump administration's attitudes and policies toward women in a way that can't be ignored. \"Through this movement, we can send a message loud and clear: nobody has the right to deny a woman the freedom to make decisions over her own body,\" Sasha Skovron, a student who organized a campaign Oxford University in England, told Glamour . Though Skovron does not reside in the U.S., she wanted to be part of the movement because she feels that Trump's words and actions could have a negative impact on women around the globe, adding, \"Trump poses a great threat to this freedom, and so whether an American citizen or not, #ReadMyLips stands for women everywhere.\" \n\"No woman should be rejected of her rights, and no student should be left in fear for her future,\" echoed Jessie Xiao, an organizer at Wellesley College. \nMogul team leaders and student organizers collaborate on the #ReadMyLips campaign PHOTO: Mogul \nMichelle Wen, leader of Cornell University's movement, is hoping the campaign can tie a diverse group of women together. \"I think that, essentially, all women have the same positive sentiments towards women's empowerment and sexual health, but there has not been an uniting factor bringing us all together,\" she told Glamour . To show solidarity, she and her peers will be wearing vagina pins that Mogul has given out to participants. \nA #ReadMyLips vagina pin mailed to all letter-writers PHOTO: Mogul \nIn addition to the efforts on college campuses, many other individuals have posted their letters on Mogul's website. \"You say you like to grab pussy, but do you really care about its health?\" one reads . \"We will not let your attack on fundamental human rights go unnoticed,\" says another . \nThough students have been writing letters for weeks, #ReadMyLips officially began on Tuesday, and Mogul announced the campaign in a video that ends with the foreboding text, \"the vagina is coming.\" \nInterested in being part of the campaign?
