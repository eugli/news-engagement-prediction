Very talented USC team. \nBilas: At Notre Dame vs. Florida State is toughest game all day long. FSU is better, but Notre Dame is tough. \nWho will win Gonzaga-St. Mary's? \nGreenberg: Pace of the game is key and St. Mary's can't control the tempo of the game. \nWilliams: Very similar to Kentucky-Kansas game, I had to phone a friend. I feel like it could be St. Mary's time, but Gonzaga is going undefeated.
