Cables will monitor his heart and provide an emergency video link. \nJournalists looked on as workmen pressed together the two halves of the rock at the gallery on Wednesday. \n\"The purpose is to feel the aging stone inside the rock,\" Poincheval told Quartz Media during his weeks of preparation for the ordeal. \n\"There is my own breathing, and then the rock which lives, still humid because it was extracted not so long ago from the quarry. So there is that flow, that coming and going, between myself and the stone.\" Mental challenge \nAt the time, he was coy about how he would go to the toilet, but in the moments running up to his entombment he came clean to AFP news agency, admitting he would urinate into empty water bottles and sit on a small container to excrete. \nAnd the smell? \n\"The stone will absorb some of the smell,\" he said. \"I think I can take it.\" \nInstead, he says, one of the biggest challenges will be psychological: keeping grasp of reality. \nPoincheval is an old hand at putting his body through the bizarre and potentially perilous - often within a confined space, having previously spent 13 days inside a bear .
