Come. Have a seat. \nJimmy Kimmel is never going to run out of time to make fun of the actor, not even this Sunday, at the 2017 Oscars . \nThe Jimmy Kimmel Live! host, who is hosting the ceremony, made sure to leave a little present on his longtime onscreen rival's reserved seat at the Dolby Theater. \nKimmel defaced a photo of the actor that was placed on the chair, drawing large, pointy ears, plus earrings, a mustache, soul patch and snaggletooth on his face. The host posted a photo of his prank on Instagram Thursday evening. \n\"Best Picture Vominee Matt Damon #Oscars,\" he wrote. Read \nJimmy Kimmel and Matt Damon's Feud Just Keeps Getting Funnier \nDamon served as a producer on the drama film Manchester by the Sea , which is nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture. If it wins the big award, the actor would share it with four other producers and it would mark his second Oscar win. he and Ben Affleck both won a screenwriting Oscar for their movie Good Will Hunting in 1998. Image Group LA/ABC via Getty Images \nWhile they are friendly in real life, Kimmel and Damon have been engaged in an onscreen feud for more than a decade. It started after the talk show host began a recurring joke on his program in which he pretends to run out of time to interview the actor. \nLast week, when asked about Kimmel's Oscars hosting gig, Damon told E! News , \"He's gonna be really terrible no matter what.\" \nWhen asked if he had any message for Kimmel on his hosting skills, Damon joked, \"No, [Jimmy] knows I hate him, and there's also a restraining order at the moment, so we're not allowed to directly address each other.\" Watch E!'s live 2017 Oscars red carpet coverage on Sunday, Feb. 26 starting at 1:30 p.m. ET/10:30 a.m. PT, and join the conversation on Oscar.com and across social with #oscars and #eredcarpet.
