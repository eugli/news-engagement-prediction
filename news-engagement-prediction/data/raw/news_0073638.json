I just put in my headphones, play my music.\"\nKeffer said he was impressed, and sympathetic to his cause.\n\"People use [a long commute] as an obstacle not to work,\" Keffer said. \"I wanted to make sure that he understood a good work ethic and dedication like that is going to be noticed and rewarded.\"\nKeffer went back to his department after dropping the teen off, and asked his superiors if there was anything they could do for him.\nThey eventually gathered some extra money from their department’s account, and surprised Duncan with a brand new bicycle.\nRead: Community Raises $5,000 for 8-Year-Old Triplets with Brain Tumors: 'It's Been a Struggle' \n\"He helped make my life easier,\" Duncan said, adding that his commute time was reduced to only 50 minutes in one direction. \"They care about their community , they care about their people and they care to help us.\"\nInspired by what good a little money could do, the police department then started a GoFundMe page for Duncan that turned his life upside down just months later.\n\"Every chance we get to help somebody out we try to do it,\" Keffer said.\nWatch: Deputy Responds To Girl, 19, Who Stole His Bike to Get Home Safely: 'It Had to be Scary For Her' \nRelated Articles: Soldier's Wife Weeps Over His Coffin on Airport Tarmac Restaurant Owner Gives Family a Discount for Well-Behaved Kids Cop Helps Girl, 10, With Her Homework After She Messaged Police", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:22:14.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
