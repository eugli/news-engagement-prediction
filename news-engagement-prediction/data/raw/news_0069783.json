Now a new viral photo has made that fact inescapably clear.\nReddit user MrFlow posted the image below with the caption \" What Nutella is actually made of .\" It shows Nutella's top five ingredients layered in the jar.\n© Reddit Sugar takes up nearly half(!) the container. Palm oil, which is high in saturated fat , is the second most abundant ingredient. Skim milk powder, cocoa, and hazelnuts fill up the rest of the jar. (Missing are the emulsifier lecithin and the artificial flavor vanillin.)\nWe know this image is unverified, but it's likely not far from the truth. There's no question the spread is loaded with sugar and fat. And the striking visual is a good reminder to enjoy the beloved treat in moderation.\nTo satisfy your Nutella cravings, try whipping up our yummy Nutella alternative instead: The recipe calls for one avocado , raw cacao powder, maple syrup, vanilla extract, a pinch of salt—and that's it. See how it's made in the video below.\nYou can smear this low-sugar spread on toast or apple slices; or use it as the filling in whoopie pies or s'mores. With nutritious, fiber-rich avocado as the main ingredient, the fudgy frosting is a treat you can feel good about.\nClick to expand Replay Video A New Way To Save The Planet?
