The law gave only a handful of e-liquid producers control of the entire Indiana market.

Six companies were approved to make e-liquid by Mulhaupt’s. \nWhile lawmakers had planned on just making the legislation less restrictive to get rid of the monopoly, Sen. Randall Head, R-Logansport, threw out most security-related manufacturing requirements in amendments presented directly before the vote, citing the court ruling as the reason why. \n\"We could come up with any rules we wanted for manufacturers within our state but we can't impose those same rules and regulations on out-of-state facilities,\" Head said. \"My aim with these amendments is to No. 1 get into compliance with federal court opinion. And No. 2, I don’t want to create a two-tier system where we have more rules for manufacturers here than we do elsewhere, because that would simply drive manufacturers out of state and the products would still be sold here, but we’d be costing business and jobs here.\" \nLawmakers had already planned on removing all specifications about security firms when they proposed this year's Senate bill. In a committee hearing Wednesday, Senators also removed several requirements including measures that all e-liquid ingredients had to be stored somewhere only authorized personnel could access and that companies must have remotely monitored security systems. \nThe main restrictions kept in place, Head said, were that packaging needs to be tamper-proof, the vapor products need to have a child safety cap and companies have to meet federal regulations. \nThe Senate Judiciary Committee voted 8-1 on the amended bill, and it heads to the Senate floor next. \nEvan McMahon, owner of Liberation Vape and Hoosier Vapers spokesman, said the updated legislation is a step in the right direction in correcting industry standards. \n\"I firmly understand and accept that states desire to have oversight, and this bill actually maintains the oversight for the state of Indiana, but it does it while understanding there are federal rules and regulations in place,\" McMahon said. \"...There is no fear that there is not enough regulation. There is 2,400 pages of (federal) regulation.\" \nMaphaupt's president Doug Mulhaupt issued a statement about the reduction of security requirements, saying they \"respect\" the committee's decision, and will continue to watch the bill. \n\"Mulhaupt's takes the business of protecting Hoosier consumers very seriously,\" Doug Mulhaupt said. \"Any changes to e-liquid laws should not put safety at risk.\" \nEven before the federal court decision, Indiana's vaping law has been a subject of criticism, as it led to businesses closing or moving across state lines as well as an increase in e-liquid prices. The passage of amended law in 2015 is currently being investigated by the FBI, and the Senate made changing the law a priority, designating it Senate Bill 1. \nIn the appeals court decision, Judge David Hamilton wrote that the security firm requirements were “astoundingly specific” \n“These circumstances raise obvious concerns about protectionists purposes and what looks very much like a legislative grant of a monopoly to one favored in-state company in the security business,” the court said. \nSen. Ron Alting, R-Lafayette, who pushed for the changes last legislative session, previously said the intent was not to create a monopoly. \n\"I'm just pleased we’re moving forward,\" Alting said, \"that we didn’t just dig in the trenches and say it was going to be last year’s bill and we’re not going to make any attempt to clean it up.” \nIndy Star reporters Tony Cook, Mark Alesia and Tim Evans contributed to this story.​ \nCall Evansville Courier & Press reporter Kaitlin Lange at (812) 549-1429.
