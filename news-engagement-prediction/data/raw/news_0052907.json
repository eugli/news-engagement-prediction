The story of three African-American women helping send John Glenn into space has made a serious impression on audiences and narrowly edged out La La Land (widely considered a favorite to win big this year ) to become the Best Picture frontrunner with 26% of the responses. Following La La Land 's 25% response, the results dip significantly, as Arrival brought in third place with 13% of replies, and they tail off leading down to Lion -- which garnered only 3% of the responses. \nIt's hard to completely pinpoint the exact reasons why Hidden Figures came out on top in this survey, but I think there are a couple of reasons. For starters, Hidden Figures is a much more light-hearted movie compared to others on this list. Yes, it focuses on segregation and the racial divide in America, but it's ultimately very optimistic in the way in which it tackles those issues. By contrast, most of the other nominated movies this year (with the notable exception of La La Land ) are generally darker in tone and focus on heavier subject matters. \nBuilding upon that idea, I think it's worth acknowledging the fact that Hidden Figures will likely maintain quite a bit of staying power with audiences over time. The film's themes of race relations and civil rights progress echo issues that resonate with modern audiences, and it doesn't seem likely that these matters are going away anytime soon. Of all the movies present on this list, Hidden Figures seems like one that will be taught in schools for years to come, and that makes it a strong contender for this honor. \nOf course, it's only a matter of time until we finally see which of these films will walk away with the Best Picture Oscar. The Academy Awards will air this Sunday night, February 26, at 8:30 p.m. EST.
