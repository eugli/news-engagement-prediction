White House employee can’t stand new boss, quits after eight days Posted at 9:26 pm on February 23, 2017 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nEarlier this week, the Washington Post published a column from a man who left the CIA soon after President Trump assumed office, and presumably quite a while longer since he’d donated $5,000 to Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democrats. \nNow, The Atlantic has published a piece by a Muslim woman who worked for the National Security Council but quit just eight days into the new administration. \nBefore we get too far along here … is everyone who quits their government gig during the transition from one administration to the next going to write an essay about it? Because this is already getting a little stale. By all means, any government employee — say, a Secret Service agent — who doesn’t think he or she can do his or her job under President Trump really ought to quit for everyone’s sake … and just post the personal thoughts to LinkedIn and move on. \nAfter this last essay, of course. It’s fascinating and a must-read, we’ve heard. \"The diverse White House I had worked in became a monochromatic and male bastion.\" A fascinating and must-read essay https://t.co/0yYTabN4WS \n— Kristen East (@kristenicoleast) February 23, 2017 \nAt the risk of sounding (even more) insensitive to writer Rumana Ahmed’s plight, she notes that she was hired to work at the White House straight out of college, in 2011. That would make the White House gig her first “real” job, and she worked steadily for the same boss, so to speak, until 2017. We’d bet plenty of workers in the private sector have undergone similar management upheavals, perhaps at several employers, and in general, they always suck. At least that stint in the White House will always look good on a resume. \nNBC News’ Katy Tur was among many media types who passed the essay around on social media.
