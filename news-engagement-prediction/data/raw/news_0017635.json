In either case, people are required to have a motorized snow vehicle operator's license.\nEven though the girl wasn't from the area, Girard says local riders are feeling the loss.\n\"They're hurt,\" she says. \"Everybody has a heavy heart, and they're not too sure how to react at this point.\"\nOPP say the crash is still under investigation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:35:08.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
