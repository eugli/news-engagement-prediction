Crossrail train carriage subjected to icy blasts and sweltering heats \nHis predecessor George Osborne gave it the green light last year but without a detailed plan for funding, timing or legislation. \nCrossrail 2 would increase the capital’s rail capacity by 10 per cent – bringing in an extra 270,000 people into central London every morning - while cutting journey times. \nTransport for London today published a study that predicted “meltdown” at 17 London Underground stations – including Waterloo and Victoria - by 2030 without it. \nThe report said the benefits of the new HS2 line going into Euston could be cancelled out as thousands of arriving passengers would be forced to queue to get onto the Tube. \nWhile Tube improvements and the opening of the Elizabeth line will provide extra capacity in the coming years, it will not be enough to cope with growing demand. \nIn a speech tonight, Mr Khan was expected to say: “Crossrail 2 is crucial to meeting our ambitious targets for new affordable homes. It’s crucial to unlocking future economic growth in the aftermath of the EU referendum. \n“Crossrail 2 is the answer to help the entire country, because when London succeeds, Britain succeeds.” \nHowever, one Whitehall insider said the project was still a long way off and that the Government’s commitment to it had not changed.
