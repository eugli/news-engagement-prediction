Close New ad to highlight mobile use dangers UP NEXT VIDEO New ad to highlight mobile use dangers \nThe hard-hitting ad from the Pedestrian Council of Australia shows a young woman walking down the footpath of a suburban street. \nEngrossed in her phone and wearing headphones, the woman makes the fatal mistake of stepping out on to the street without looking both ways. \nA car strikes her, the impact playing out in full view while the tune she was playing is cut short along with her life. The young woman is engrossed in her phone, like so many young pedestrians.

Source: YouTube/PCA Confronting ad to get pedestrians attention \nThe lobby group's spokesman Harold Scruby said the ad is intended to shock and believes it will save lives. \n\"This is the most powerful ad we've ever done,\" he told 7 News Online. \n\"Everyone who's seen it is pretty shocked by it.\" A previous 'Don't tune out' ad from the council. Source: PCA \nThe commercial follows a theme trotted out over the past few years, the message delivered with more force in each reprise. \nThe PCA's \"Don't Tune Out\" line was used in 2010's \"Lambs to the slaughter\" awareness campaign. \nIts website states the ad was targeting the \"many pedestrians who often act like sheep when crossing the road, particularly at traffic lights\" with many blithely crossing while \"listening to iPods & MP3 players, texting or using mobile phones\". 'Mock advertising': The PCA tried to get pedestrians to wake up seven years ago. Source: PCA Sydney's 'phone zombies' wander aimlessly into danger \n\"When one sheep walks the rest follow without stopping, looking and listening,\" it added. \nMr Scruby described the early campaign as \"mock advertising\" but the PCA has stepped up to \"shock advertising\". \nAnd pedestrians and drivers need to be shocked. Road fatalities have been increasing in recent years, with pedestrian deaths jumping from 162 in 2015 to 185 in 2016. \nYoung pedestrians in particular, like the woman shown in the ad, are far more likely to walk into a world of pain – or death – because they are concentrating on their phones. Close Ireland's 'Shame on You' speeding ad UP NEXT VIDEO The Irish road safety ad from 2014 was so shocking it was banned on TV before 9pm. Source: DOE/YouTube Ireland's 'Shame on You' speeding ad \nNRMA spokesman Peter Khoury said while graphic ads have impact they are not always far reaching and long term. \n\"Not everyone responds to shock,\" he said. \nOf particular note, Mr Khoury said, the infamous \"pinky\" ad that shocked older Australians with its crude message but cut through with its target audience – young males with something to prove behind the wheel. \n\"Not to say there is no place for shock, but different groups that respond to different groups of advertising.\" \nMr Khoury suggested a diverse message campaign that is followed up with more ads is the best way to get a message across. Close 'Little Pinky' ad shocked but cut through UP NEXT VIDEO 'Little Pinky' ad shocked but cut through. Source: RTA/YouTube 'Little Pinky' ad shocked but cut through \nSydney University marketing expert Dr Rohan Miller doubted the ad's message would cut through. \n\"It's just really hard, too hard in fact to change habitual behaviours like talking on your phone and listening to music,\" he said. \nMr Scruby remains unapologetic and believes the ad will work. \n\"If it saves one life I don't care how confronting it is,\" he said. \"I believe this will save lives.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:45:08.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
