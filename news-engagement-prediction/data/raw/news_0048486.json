The bank closed 223 UK branches last year.\nGroup Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said the bank was investing more than $2bn in \"digital transformation initiatives to improve our offer to customers\".\nHSBC has been on a cost-cutting drive since 2015, with plans to cut 8,000 jobs in the UK and achieve $5bn in savings.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38733107", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/16413/production/_90355119_gettyimages-543145070.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/C172/production/_88022594_80089859.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-21T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:09:46.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
