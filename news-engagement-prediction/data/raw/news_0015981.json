It said the president “spends his evenings alone sending tweets out into the social media universe, watching television in his bathrobe or walking around the White House, trying to learn the interiors of his new home.” \nMr. Spicer called the article “literally the epitome of fake news.” \n“Start at the top,” he told reporters. “I don’t think the president owns a bathrobe. He definitely doesn’t wear one.” \nMr. Trump took to Twitter about the article, saying, “The failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me. They have gotten it wrong for two years, and now are making up stories & sources!” \nThe article also said Mr. Trump’s aides “confer in the dark because they cannot figure out how to operate the light switches in the Cabinet room.” \nMr. Spicer said it’s “not an accurate portrayal of what’s really happening.” \n“From top to bottom, it made up stories that don’t exist,” he said. “And I think that’s unfortunate for people that look to news institutions like that for their news.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:51:07.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
