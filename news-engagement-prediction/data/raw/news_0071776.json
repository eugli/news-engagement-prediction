Getty The Stoke-on-Trent Central and Copeland by-elections are two of the most important by-elections in recent political history. Polling stations closed at 10 p.m. GMT. Final results are expected to arrive around 3 a.m. GMT tomorrow morning. Storm Doris continues to cross central and northern parts of England as strong wind and rain hit both constituencies. \nLocals from the Stoke-on-Trent Central and Copeland constituencies have finished casting their votes for their new MP, in what is shaping up to be two of the most important by-elections in recent political history in Britain. \nBoth constituencies provide a significant window into Britain's electorate right now and will provide the political parties with a litmus test for how their parties are being perceived. For example, the Copeland seat has always been held by Labour but now bookies suggest it will fall to the Conservatives. \nFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage said last week that the result of the Stoke by-election was \"absolutely fundamental\" to the party's future. UKIP was a favourite to win the seat — but not anymore. \nThe results, which are scheduled for 3 a.m. GMT, could be delayed if the storms cause difficulties in transporting ballot papers. \nThere will be no exit polls. \n12.51 — TURNOUTS WERE HEALTHY \nThe recent Richmond by-election where Zac Goldsmith stood as an independent candidate (and lost) was the highest of the 10 byelections held this parliament. \nThe 51% the turnout in Copeland came in second. \nThe count is back underway. A 51.35% turnout is fantastic given some of the projections and what's happened in Stoke. — Adam Payne (@adampayne26) February 24, 2017 \n\n12.43 — JENRICK MP SAYS THE FACT THERE IS NATIONAL MEDIA ATTENTION ON STOKE MEANS LABOUR HAS ALREADY LOST \nSky News \nRobert Jenrick, Conservative MP for Newark, told Sky News that the fact that Stoke, which should be a \"done deal\" for Labour, has the level of national media attention that it does is because people are disillusioned with Labour. \nHe said that the \"only reason\" why they are all there, is because two Labour MPs decided to step down because of the lack of faith in their leader Jeremy Corbyn. \nHe added that even if Labour hangs onto a seat, the fact that there is even a question of another party taking its seat means that the Labour party is in disarray. \n12.35 — CANDIDATES START TURNING UP IN STOKE \nThe @Official_MRLP have arrived!

At a difficult time for the party, in the midst of the article 50 debates, our MPs have led the way. Thank you for all you have done motivating members and activists, at our phone banks, supporting our candidates and, of course, hitting the doors day in and day out. Special thanks are of course due to Andrew Gwynne, Sue Hayman, Cat Smith, Jack Dromey and Ruth Smeeth, who have gone above and beyond to lead these campaigns on behalf of the Party. Myself, the PLP, and the whole of the Labour movement owe you a great debt of thanks. \nWe always knew that these were going to be competitive, close and challenging elections, but with your help we have made the arguments on the issues that matter to working people – our local NHS services, and an economy that works for the whole of the country, ensuring that no one is left behind. We should all be proud of the campaigns we have run, and I have extended my thanks, on behalf of the PLP, to the party staff who have put their lives on hold and worked seven-day weeks to make the case for Labour. \nWe will know more once the counts are underway, and of course, colleagues will be kept updated. But for now, thank you again, and I hope everyone has the chance to relax this evening after a long (and wet) day on the doorstep. \nBest wishes Leader of the Labour Party \n11.50 — LABOUR'S MOOD IS ON THE UP IN COPELAND \nCounting gets underway in the Copeland by-election at Whitehaven Sports Centre in Cumbria. PA \nLabour are feeling better about their chances in Copeland now as the votes come in. \nBusiness Insider's Adam Payne tells me: \"It's still very early days here in Copeland with a declaration not expected until around 04:00 a.m. (GMT) but the mood in the Labour camp appears to be improving. The word here in the Whitehaven Sports Centre is that Gillian Troughton's strong NHS attack line has really cut through with locals. There is still a long way to go — but a tight Labour hold looks like a good bet as things stand.\" \n11.40 — LABOUR'S NHS CAMPAIGN \"CUT THROUGH\" IN COPELAND \nThe Copeland result must be close because both sides are briefing they've lost. Here's Dan Hodges from the Telegraph and Beth Rigby from Sky News. \nLeaving the count now, that was the vibe. One of my Tory sources saying #NHS fears had cut thru with voters... https://t.co/h6pWnC88nf — Beth Rigby (@BethRigby) February 23, 2017 \n11.30 — THE TORY VOTE IS HOLDING UP IN COPELAND \nAdam Payne/Business Insider \nBusiness Insider's Adam Payne tells us that the \"Tory vote is holding up very well in rural areas like Embleton. Early signs suggests it's gonna be very close.\" \n11.15 — DOUGLAS CARSWELL CONCEDES DEFEAT FOR UKIP IN STOKE \nUKIP's only MP Douglas Carswell has just all but conceded defeat in Stoke. He told the audience on BBC Question Time that the \"most likely outcome is Labour will win\". \nHe added that \"although we fought a good campaign... we do need to accept we have a problem and that is that we are not given the benefit of the doubt.\" \"We need to ask ourselves what is it about our values that means people aren't giving us the benefit of the doubt.\" \nCarswell, who is the enemy number one of former leader Nigel Farage, blamed the party's problems on the \"shock and awful tactics in the run up to the last general election... that need to be addressed if we are to win seats\". \n11.05 — SOME LABOUR OPTIMISM IN COPELAND \nNot everyone is feeling gloomy in Labour's Copeland campaign. My colleague Adam Payne reports that among some activists there is optimism that a fall in support for UKIP could help them hold on. \nLabour source: activists got positive feedback in an area that was strong-UKIP in 2015. Turnout holding up too. More positive for Labour. — Adam Payne (@adampayne26) February 23, 2017 \n10.55 — BLAME GAME BEGINS \nPolls have been closed for less than an hour and the blame game has already begun. Newsnight editor Ian Katz reports that Corbyn's team is planning to lay the blame for defeat in Copeland tonight (if defeat it is) on the Blairites. \nInteresting strategy: if Lab loses one of bylelections Corbyn team planning concerted attack on Blairites reports @nicholaswatt #newsnight — Ian Katz (@iankatz1000) February 23, 2017 \nCorbyn's team laid the ground for this last week following Blair's Brexit speech when they briefed that he was attempting to sabotage the by-elections by making it appear that Labour oppose Brexit. Expect to hear much more of the same in the coming hours and days if Labour fall short in either seat. \n10.45 — UPDATE FROM THE COUNT IN COPELAND \nMy colleague Adam Payne is at the count in Copeland. There's no clear picture yet of which way it's going. He tells us: \"Counting is officially underway here in Whitehaven and the general feeling is that it's too close to call. Labour's election strategist Andrew Gwynne MP is watching closely as counters make their way through the first boxes. One Labour figure I spoke to feared a 'comfortable' victory for the Tories but others wearing red sashes are confident. The Tories in attendance are quietly optimistic, too. It's really on a knife edge as things stand.\" \n10.30 — WHO WILL WIN IN COPELAND AND STOKE? \nThe Copeland by-election was called after Labour MP and leading Jeremy Corbyn critic, Jamie Reed resigned the seat in order to pursue a new career in the nuclear industry. \nIn ordinary political circumstances Labour would expect to win a by-election like this by a huge margin. However, the seat is a largely rural and post-industrial constituency with poor infrastructure and many voters hugely disillusioned with the current state of the Labour party, all of which leaves the door wide open for an upset. \nThe local Labour party ran a strong local candidate Gillian Troughton and have fought an aggressive and sometimes controversial campaign centred on the NHS. \nThe Tories meanwhile focused on Jeremy Corbyn and his opposition to the nuclear industry which is a major employer in this seat. Despite bookies expecting a clear win for the Conservatives, Labour believes it may just hold on, even by just a few hundred votes. \nJournalists often overstate the importance of campaigns, however. Looking purely at the current national opinion polling and applying a universal swing to the seat, it looks like the Tories will very narrowly claim the seat, but it will be very close. Here's the prediction from the Electoral Calculus website: Electoral Calculus \nStoke-on-Trent Central: \nThe Stoke by-election was called after Labour MP Tristram Hunt resigned his seat. The Midlands constituency was initially strongly favoured by commentators (although not by Business Insider) to be claimed by UKIP after new leader Paul Nuttall announced his candidacy. The high proportion of voters who backed Leave in the referendum and local disillusionment with Labour led many to bet on Nuttall becoming his party's second MP in Parliament. \nUkip leader Paul Nuttall arriving to cast his vote at The Willows Primary School polling station in Stoke as voting gets underway in the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election. PA \nHowever, a dreadful campaign which included a row about whether he lived in the constituency , another huge row about whether he had lost close friends in the Hillsborough disaster , and a much smaller row about a UKIP canvasser urinating in a voters' garden , have all sent Nuttall's odds of victory plummeting, with Labour's Gareth Snell now the strong favourite to win the seat. \nNot only are UKIP now unlikely to win but their opponents now believe they could even come third or fourth. A visit in recent days by Theresa May to the constituency suggests the Tories also expect a strong performance, with UKIP now even appearing concerned about the possibility of being overtaken by the Lib Dems. \nAs with Copeland, the affect of the campaigns on the result to is likely to have been overstated. Looking purely at national opinion polls and universal swing, Stoke looks highly likely to be a clear win for Labour, with the Tories in second place and UKIP coming in a poor third. Here's the prediction from the Electoral Calculus website. Electoral Calculus \n10.25 — TURNOUT? \nNormally at this period of the night during election counts there are reports on Twitter and elsewhere about turnout either being high or low with some even venturing percentages based on anonymous sources. Ignore all of these. They are almost always wrong. \n10.15 — COUNTING BEGINS IN COPELAND AND STOKE \nThe first exciting symbolic moment of the night as the first ballot boxes arrive. \nThe first box is open!

Today, hundreds have braved Storm Doris, as part of two excellent campaigns, with activists pouring in from across Britain. The political establishment has let down Copeland and Stoke, who have seen their industries gutted, living standards stagnate and hope for a better future for their children and grandchildren decline. Whatever the results, the Labour Party - and our mass membership - must go further to break the failed political consensus, and win power to rebuild and transform Britain.\" \n10.00— THE POLLS HAVE CLOSED \nThe polls have now closed in the Stoke-on-Trent and Copeland by-elections. What do we know? Well reports from Stoke suggest that Labour are quietly confident of holding onto the seat. However, my colleague Adam Payne tells me that Labour people in Copeland are feeling much less comfortable and believe the Tories have won the day. Are they right? We've no idea. \nNot a single vote has been counted yet and we've got a long way to go. The final result isn't expected until at least 3 a.m. tomorrow morning. \nThe mood among Labour activists here isn't great. Some even fearing a comfortable Tory victory. Expectation management? Possibly.
