I do not want the names of these parties to be affected by my activities as an NGO leader.    \n\"I know my actions may not be legally right, but I was doing my part for the people of Selangor. I do not want my friends and family to be subjected to 'gambling addiction'.    \n\"As for my NGO posts, I do not think there is any conflict. However, if the members feel I should step down, I do not mind doing so,\" he said.    \nOn his statement about wanting to open his own gambling den, Jamal said he was merely being cynical.    \n\"I wanted to see how easy it is to get a licence to run a gambling den.    \n\"From what I understand, in the last five days since I was arrested, 28 licences have been given out by the local council for such premises.    \n\"The sad thing is, it's not even in the jurisdiction of the police to catch these people, because they are licensed,\" he said.    \nBusloads of his supporters at his house shed tears at Jamal's announcement of his intention to resign.    \nLast Thursday, police arrested Jamal in connection with a theft at an entertainment outlet in Ampang while nine of his friends were nabbed the night before.  \nHe was released Monday after being remanded for five days to assist police in their investigations.   \nHis nine friends were also released.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:07:24.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
