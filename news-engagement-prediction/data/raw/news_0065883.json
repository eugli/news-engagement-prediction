Begum also claims that there was 'not much money left' but confirmed that tax payers money may have been used to pay for his extremist activities - including, crucially, she believes, funding his travel to Syria where he joined ISIS. Meanwhile, Sky News have claimed MI5 dropped him off their watch list when he fled the UK in 2014. Shukee Begum, the wife of Jamal al-Harith Following questions over the monitoring of al-Harith, his wife claims he was 'stopped and questioned by UK authorities for six hours on his return' from a trip to Gaza in 2009 but apart from this she believes that 'he was not monitored'. The terrorist's wife will also tell Channel 4 News that when she was in contact with al-Harith, he was 'involved in the distribution of aid in al-Bab and was ideologically opposed to suicide attacks'. After his release from Guantanamo Bay in 2004 and return to the UK, she says that for nearly ten years he did not pose a threat. His radicalisation she says, began in late 2013, and was a response to 'atrocities committed by the regime in Syria.' His views became more extreme was after contact in Manchester with Raphael Hostey - known as Abu Qaqa al-Britaini - a major ISIS recruiter prior to his death in a drone strike in Syria last year. He travelled to Syria in 2014, where he joined ISIS. Last year, she flew to Syria with her five children she says to try to persuade her husband to return to the UK. Begum says her attempts to persuade him 'failed'. Al-Harith (left) is pictured in his early years in Manchester, England, before his detention at Gauntanamo in 2002. His wife Shukee Begum is shown right - she went to Syria with their five children but fled back to Turkey Angry: Jamal al-Harith, told the BBC in 2004 (pictured) that he wanted to spit at his American captors who were convinced he was a dangerous terrorist The jihadi, who born Ronald Fiddler, was detained in the lawless southern Afghanistan after going there after 9/11 he was then flown to Guantanamo in 2002. The US authorities said he may have spent time with Osama bin Laden in Sudan and that his back story as a backpacking Islamic scholar simply did not add up. But he was released from the notorious prison camp in 2004 and repatriated to England by private jet and released without charge. He was among more than a dozen Guantanamo detainees who were handed settlements totalling nearly £20million to end a civil case after the coalition came to power in 2010. The government is thought to have been unwilling to produce secret evidence in open court. Fiddler, who also converted to Islam in the late 1990s, was a ‘gentle’ character changed who friends and family say changed completely after being held at Guantanamo. It has been claimed al-Harith, previously known as Ronald Fiddler before converting to Islam, received £1 million compensation from the UK Government - a sum denied by his family, who regard it as wide of the mark. Speaking to BBC North West Tonight soon after his return to the UK he described being frightened to leave Guantanamo because he was so used to life there - and his hatred for the Americans who held him there. He said: ‘I was very angry actually. First when they told me I was scared because I had been in a cage for so long I didn't want to leave, strange as it might sound. My first reaction was I don't want to go. That's what came to me. 'When they were taking us out I could see the British plane waiting for us - they had to walk us over the 300 metres - and we got put in front to the British Bobby and the American soldier was taking off my chains I wanted to spit in his face but you have to hold yourself inside'. Fiddler, who also converted to Islam in the late 1990s, was a ‘gentle’ character changed who friends and family say changed completely after being held at Guantanamo. His sister Sharon said his conversion to Islam meant he stopped going to clubs, smoking and drinking and became 'placid' but added he had 'not changed much'. But ten years later he would flee Britain to join ISIS and blow himself up for them in Mosul this year. Describing the reaction when he came back to Manchester he said in the 2004 interview: 'People have been fine. People have stopped me in the streets giving me hugs and saying they have been praying for me saying if you can survive this long you can stay strong and keep going. There's been a lot of support. 'There have been people on the other side too but people generally have been very very supportive'. JAMAL'S PATH TO GUANTANAMO AND THEN SYRIA 1966: Ronald Fiddler is born in Manchester to devout Christian parents originating from Jamaica 1994: He converts to Islam, changing his name to Jamal Udeen al-Harith October 2001: Al-Harith travels to Quetta in Pakistan, on a 'religious holiday'. A few day later the US invasion of neighbouring Afghanistan began Early 2002: He is arrested by American forces in Afghanistan after they discover him in a Taliban jail and later transferred to Guantanamo Bay prison 2004: After lobbying from Tony Blair's Labour government, al-Harith is released along with five others. He returns to the UK where he is released without charge, and joins three other prisoners in suing Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 2009: His case against Rumsfield and the US government is finally dismissed on the grounds of 'limited immunity' for government officials 2014: Despite security services being fully aware of his previous detention, he is able to escape the UK to fight with ISIS in Syria 2015: His British wife Shukee Begum, along with their five children, join him in Syria before fleeing from the Isis-controlled territory February 2017: Al-Harith is killed in a suicide attack near Mosul, Iraq At the time of his release, then-Home Secretary David Blunkett, insisted: ‘No one who is returned … will actually be a threat to the security of the British people.’ Backed by human rights lawyers, Fiddler posed for publicity photographs with fellow former Guantanamo Bay detainees Martin Mubanga and Moazzam Begg. Shami Chakrabarti, the then head of Liberty who was made a Labour peer last year, said she was ‘delighted’ he was being freed. ‘We are delighted that the five have been released, but let us not forget those that are remaining,’ she said. In one interview with a national newspaper after his release Fiddler said: ‘It was very, very hard times, but I tried to think about nothing but survival.’ At the same time he married, set up a computer business and worked as an administrator in a Muslim school. But in 2014, Fiddler travelled to Islamic State controlled Syria via Turkey, a common route for would-be jihadists. His journey was revealed after his estranged wife, Shukee Begum, 34, managed to escape from the terrorist group with their five children. She endured a 10-month ordeal being passed between rebel groups as a hostage after trying to persuade her estranged husband to return home. Mrs Begum, a law graduate from Greater Manchester, said she was desperate as she was left with four children and pregnant with a fifth. She said: ‘He’s my husband and all of a sudden he’s not there. It didn’t feel like home any more. I was trying to manage school runs, things like that. ‘I was thinking about the children’s futures. Was he part of it Will he come back? All these things go through your mind.’ At that time he was based near al-Bab in northern Syria. It appears that since his wife left he joined frontline fighters. Fiddler’s ability to flee the country will once again shine the spotlight on the Government’s inability to effectively monitor terror suspects.
