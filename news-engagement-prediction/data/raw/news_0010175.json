But local children were apparently too apoplectic to get up, too. \nGreater Atlanta Christian School noticed this on their tardiness sheet Monday morning, as some new excuses followed the Falcons' championship loss. \n\"Failed to rise up\" and \"Falcons depression\" are solid alibis, but I would have had some other excuses ready to go. \"Still confused by NFL overtimes rules\" \"Like Kyle Shanahan, do not understand how a clock works\" \"Hit in the head by one of Lady Gaga's drones\" \"Gave my fibula to Alex Mack so he could play in the Super Bowl.\" \"Stole Tom Brady's jersey \" \"Bet the over on Luke Bryan's anthem time.\" \"Julio Jones fourth-quarter catch sent me into a coma. The Falcons won, right?\" \"Getting my Matt Ryan Super Bowl MVP tattoo removed\" \"Deleting Tom Brady pick-six memes from my hard drive.\" \nThese excuses might work Monday, but I doubt these kids could get away with not rising up Tuesday.
