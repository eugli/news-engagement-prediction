Anything is possible, says DFO scientist \"They're both at the lowest levels since we began our multi-species trial survey,\" Skanes told CBC Radio's The Broadcast.\n\"We haven't seen such a big decline in shrimp.\"\nKatherine Skanes is a shrimp biologist with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. (Gary Quigley/CBC)\nSkanes says the quota for the current fishing season allows fishermen to take in 20 per cent of all fishable shrimp in the zone.\nShe says in most areas with the critical designation, that amount should be just 10 per cent.\n'Frightening' numbers Glen Best, a fish harvester on Fogo Island, called the assessment results scary.\nHe said a quota cut last year has already taken a big chunk of his revenue away, and the newly-announced results from DFO aren't helping.\n\"If it keeps going the way it's going, it won't be viable,\" he told CBC Radio's The Broadcast.\n\"A couple of years ago, I think, I did up the numbers. It was about 70 per cent of our revenue. So that just gives you an idea of what shrimp means to us.\"\nGlen Best lives on Fogo Island. He says a few years ago, the vast majority of his revenue came from the shrimp fishery. (Chris Ensing/CBC)\nBest says many fishermen won't have many options come summertime, as they've already spent a lot of money investing into the shrimp fishery.\n\"If there's some there to catch, you have no option. If you're able to be viable at all, you have to try to catch what's allocated to you.\"\nIf it really does get as bad as Best fears, he's wondering what he can do to earn a living.\nCod returning, but long way to go for successful fishery, plant CEOs say 'The news is good': Northern cod stocks slowly increasing \"Where do we go? What fills the void? Is it going to be some other species? Is it going to be cod? And that's not going to happen overnight.\"\nWarm water? Though fishing is certainly a contributor to the decline, Skanes said there are also other factors, like gradually warming water.\n\"There's a lot of interactions in the ocean that, I mean, we don't fully understand all the interactions that happen, but warm temperatures are bad for shellfish species,\" she said.\nAnd with cod stocks growing as well, but with few capelin to eat, she said that cod have been eating more shrimp.\n\"It's all related, water temperature, the numbers of ground fish, the numbers of shrimp,\" she said. \"I mean they all interact together under the ocean.\"\nA breakdown of shrimp fishing areas in Atlantic Canada.
