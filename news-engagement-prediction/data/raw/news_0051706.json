To celebrate this milestone, the company has launched the AE1 Active, the latest in its long-running AE1 range. \nWith two 50W Class A/B amplifiers per speaker, they promise \"class-leading dynamics\" with all the musical insight and detail you would expect from the range. \nThey feature the pure piston ceramic aluminium cone technology, now in its fifth generation. This offers exceptional stiffness without weighing the speakers down too much. \nThe new unit is designed to work in harmony with AE's Wide Dispersion Technology waveguide, for seamless integration with the mid/bass driver. The result is a wide, spacious image. \nMORE: Bristol Show 2017 - news, highlights, best new products More after the break \nElectronically, the AE1 Active is an all-analogue design. The firm says it experimented with components like wireless inputs and Class D amplification, but found they didn't offer the performance required. \nThe cabinet has been redesigned, and now features an extensively-braced heavyweight fibreboard construction with internal damping panels and a slot port. This makes for reduced baffle space and less wind noise at high volumes. \nThe AE1 Actives are on sale now, priced £1,000 for the piano black or piano white finish, and £1,200 for the piano cherry veneer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:46:29.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
