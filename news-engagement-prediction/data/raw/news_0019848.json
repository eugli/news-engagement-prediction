Rangers are currently 27 points behind their Glasgow rivals and last weekend slipped back behind Aberdeen on goal difference after a disappointing 1-1 draw with Ross County at Ibrox.\nHis assistant manager, David Weir, has also stepped down along with the club’s head of recruitment, Frank McParland, the statement said, with the trio set to take over at another, unspecified club.\n“Rangers has accepted the resignations of manager Mark Warburton, assistant manager David Weir and the club’s head of recruitment Frank McParland,” the statement read.\n“At a meeting with the management team’s representative earlier this week the club were advised that Mr Warburton, Mr Weir and Mr McParland wished to resign their positions and leave the club on condition that Rangers agreed to waive its rights to substantial compensation.\n“Rangers’ agreement to waive compensation would assist the management team to join another club. This compensation amount was agreed when Rangers significantly improved Mr Warburton and Mr Weir’s financial arrangements before the start of this season.”\nThe statement added that it was important for the board that the manager wanted to be at the club and was dedicated to taking the team back to the Scottish title.\n“The board urgently convened to consider the offer made on behalf of the management team and its ramifications and agreed to accept it and release the trio from the burden of compensation, despite the potential financial cost to the club.\n“It is important that Rangers has a football management team that wants to be at the club and that the board believes can take the club forward to meet our stated ambition to return to being the number one club in Scotland. We are clearly short of where we expected to be at this time.”\nIt added: “On Sunday Under-20s coach Graeme Murty will take interim charge of the team. We know our support will give him and our team their full backing. We thank our support for their loyalty and desire to be the best.”\nWarburton had enjoyed a successful first season at the club, winning promotion to the Scottish Premiership and going close in the Scottish Cup, and was rewarded with a contract extension last summer taking his deal to 2019.\nHowever, despite some positive results, his second season has been a struggle. Rangers were thrashed by Celtic in the campaign’s opening Old Firm derby , while the signing of Joey Barton proved a mistake on the field and a major distraction off it, culminating in the midfielder’s contract being terminated in November.\nShould Warburton’s position be available, then there are several potential candidates to fill the role. The former Nottingham Forest manager Billy Davies, who started his playing career at Rangers, is a possibility along with the St Johnstone manager, Tommy Wright, and Aberdeen’s Derek McInnes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:35:07.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
