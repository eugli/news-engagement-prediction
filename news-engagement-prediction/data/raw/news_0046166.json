By 6:55 p.m., the 700-seat auditorium was almost full.\nJulie Hanahan of Wilmette, whose children attend elementary schools in the district, said she supported the seminar day.\n\"I just think it's ridiculous that outside forces are coming in and telling us how to do things,\" Hanahan said. \"I'm sure there are people from this district that oppose (the seminar day), but I think the motor driving this is from outside.\"\nNew Trier High School seminar day Kathy Routliffe / Pioneer Press Wilmette resident Lucy Klocksin, a supporter of New Trier High School's upcoming seminar day on civil rights, carried this sign reading \"Commit Minds to Inquiry,\" part of the New Trier school district's mission statement, at a school board meeting Feb. 20.

(Kathy Routliffe / Pioneer Press) Opponent Mark McCuaig of Skokie said he thought the seminar day should include more diverse voices.\n\"I don't like what's going on,\" he said. \"It's indoctrination from the left.\"\nA statement from the district issued before the meeting said it is \"confident\" the seminar day – which includes keynote speeches and more than 100 workshops, two of which each student will attend – would examine issues from multiple perspectives and provide a positive experience for students.\nOpponents, organized under the name \"Parents of New Trier,\" started an online petition in January, asking the district to either add conservative speakers or cancel the seminar day until that could be done. They made the same request at the school board's January meeting.\nWilmette resident Betsy Hart, who helped organize the seminar opponents, said earlier this month that the petition had several hundred signatures. On Monday, the \"Parents of New Trier\" website also featured a second petition, asking that students be excused without repercussions on the seminar day if they had their parents' approval to do so.\nNew Trier High School Kathy Routliffe / Pioneer Press The Cornog Auditorium at New Trier High School's Northfield campus can seat 700, according to New Trier officials.
