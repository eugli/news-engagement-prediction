The jams cost the average driver in the city $2,408 a year\nThe traffic costs the average driver in Los Angeles $2,408 each or $9.7 billion city wide.\nInrix found that the U.S. had half of the top 10 most congested cities in the world.\nWhile Thailand was the world's most congested country in 2016, the United States had the worst traffic among rich, developed economies with drivers nationwide averaging 42 hours stuck in traffic.\nSan Francisco was the fourth-most congested city, while Bogota, Colombia, was fifth. \nSao Paulo, London, Atlanta, Paris and Miami rounded out the top 10.\nTraffic jams cost drivers in the U.S. nearly $300 billion last year, or an average of $1,400 each, Inrix said.\nThe company based in Kirkland, Washington, aggregates and analyzes traffic data collected from vehicles and highway infrastructure. \nThe top ten most congested cities in the US 1. Los Angeles, CA (1 in world)\n2. New York, NY (3 in world)\n3. San Francisco, CA (4 in world)\n4. Atlanta, GA (8 in world)\n5. Miami, FL (10 in world)\n6. Washington D.C. (13 in world)\n7.

Seattle, WA (20 in world) \nThe latest edition of its Global Traffic Scorecard report was based on 500 terabytes of data from 300 million sources.\nInrix's senior economist Bob Pishue said: 'A stable U.S. economy, continued urbanization of major cities, and factors such as employment growth and low gas prices have all contributed to increased traffic in 2016.\n'Congestion also costs our country hundreds of billions of dollars, threatens future economic growth and lowers our quality of life. \n'Traffic truly is a double-edged sword.'\nAnd, according to Mr Pishue, the issue is not expected to get any better in the near future. \n'The demand for driving is expected to continue to rise, while the supply of roadway will remain flat,' he said. \nThe worst stretch of road in the United States is New York City's Cross Bronx Expressway, where drivers on the 4.7 mile (7.5 km) road spent an average of 86 hours a year staring at the bumper of the car ahead.\nNew York City is the third most congested city in the world with drivers spending 89 hours in traffic\nOf the 240 U.S. cities studied by Inrix, commuters in Parkersburg, West Virginia, spent the least amount of time in traffic - just three hours a year.\nU.S. traffic congestion is not a new problem, but it could get renewed attention if President Donald Trump pushes for a large-scale infrastructure investment program as he has promised.\nChronic traffic jams are a concern for global automakers, and some major cities have begun to limit private motor vehicle access to central city areas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T13:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T14:06:19.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
