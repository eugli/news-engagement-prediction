He's named his biggest idols. \nAt the beginning of the season Chelsea's form was a little flaky and their defence looked particularly shaky as Antonio Conte surprised everyone by not playing his favoured three at the back system. \nHowever at 3-0 down at Arsenal, which never happens to Chelsea, earlier on in the season Conte decided to move to his 3-4-3 system. \nWith very few options at centre back in order to play the system Azpilicueta had to move inside from his full-back role and he's slotted in so naturally. \nAnd speaking to the Premier League website has named two players he idolised saying: \n\"I liked very much Lampard and Drogba. \n\"I liked the way they played and even more when I came here and I had the chance to have them in the dressing room. \n\"As idols, they became even bigger.\" \nThe Spaniard certainly could have picked worse players than the former Chelsea pair who Azpilicueta would have trained with in the early part of his Stamford Bridge career. \nBoth Lampard and Drogba were part of the incredibly strong spine that Jose Mourinho built in his first spell at Chelsea that won back-to-back Premier League titles. \nWatch David Luiz call his mate Kaka live on Chelsea TV: \n(Credit: Chelsea ) \nThe English midfielder and Ivorian striker were joined by Petr Cech, John Terry and Claude Makelele as an incredible backbone to the team. \nLampard won three Premier League titles with the Blues with Drogba winning a further one in his second spell there. \nAzpilicueta definitely could have chosen worse players!
