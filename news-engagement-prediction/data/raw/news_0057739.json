(Getty Images) \nUpdated at 7:53 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 7:53 p.m. ET \nThe 76ers are sending Ersan Ilyasova to the Hawks for Tiago Splitter and two second-round picks, per the Vertical's Adrian Wojnarowski . \nWojnarowski reports that the 76ers and Hawks will swap 2017 second-round picks, and Philadelphia will also receive an additional second-round pick from Atlanta (via Miami) in the deal. \nIlyasova has been solid since he was added to the Sixers roster at the beginning of the season, but it's clear Philadelphia is still in \"process\" mode. Joel Embiid is still sitting out and Ben Simmons hasn't suited up for Philly this year. \nTRADE DEADLINE: Follow along with all of the NBA's wheeling and dealing \nThe 29-year-old Ilyasova isn't fit for the rebuild process, but at 15 points per game on 36 percent 3-point shooting, is a solid floor-stretching pickup for the Hawks. Atlanta didn't give much up for him either. Splitter is playing just 16 minutes per game, scoring six points and pulling down three rebounds. \nFinancially, this move doesn't damage either team, as both players are on expiring deals worth similar money. \nBut the Sixers were able to stock the cupboard with even more draft picks as the ghost of Sam Hinkie lives on.
