Reason - Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira hosted a pre-birthday bash for the actor, who turns a year older on February 25. The 'Rangoon' actor and his star wife looked adorable together as they posed for the media, ahead of the bash. While the birthday boy kept it casual in a white tee and jacket teamed with denims, Mira looked pretty in a nude-coloured dress. According to reports, it was Mira's idea to throw a big birthday bash for her darling husband. And it sure was a roaring success! \n\n\n\n\nShahid's 'Padmavati' co-stars Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone made their presence felt at the party. Deepika looked every bit the glamorous goddess in shiny golden pants and a black top, replete with textured ponytail and brown-toned eyes. Ranveer, on the other hand, was his quirky self in a white see-through hooded top with white pants and black shoes. The actor made a statement yet again with his sartorial choice. \n\n\nKatrina Kaif kept it easy-breezy in a beautiful floral maxi dress while Sonakshi Sinha showed her sporty side in a white short number teamed with sneakers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile these stars made solo appearances, the evening also saw some alleged couples make a joint entrance together. Varun Dhawan arrived at the venue with his rumoured girlfriend Natasha Dalal. 'Kapoor & Sons' stars Alia Bhatt and Sidharth Malhotra too were seen together at the party. Meanwhile, Alia and Sidharth's mentor Karan Johar was more than happy to pose with his newfound mentee Sara Ali Khan. Saif Ali Khan's daughter was a sight for sore eyes in her black-and-white number as she smiled for the shutterbugs with KJo. Sara's father recently confirmed that Karan has indeed taken Sara under his wing and will be launching her in Bollywood. Others present at the bash also included Farah Khan, Atul Kasbekar, R Balki and Gauri Shinde.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T06:13:59.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
