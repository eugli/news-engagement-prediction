The video was created by friend Aaron Howell and videographer Kevin Creedon, of Plan 9 Wedding Video Productions in Carbis Bay. Laura put it up on Facebook on Tuesday evening and said she can not believe the attention it has had. She added: 'I can't believe it. I just put it up so everyone could see it.
