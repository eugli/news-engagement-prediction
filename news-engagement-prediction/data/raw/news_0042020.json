Manchester City's red-hot Gabriel Jesus will face an extended spell on the sidelines after injuring his foot, and Ian Wright has raised an interesting theory behind the knock. \nThe budding star has burst onto the scene with his performances - not to mention his celebrations - but Pep Guardiola will be without his services for 2-3 months. Damn shame! \nJesus continued to keep Sergio Aguero out of the starting XI by spearheading the attack for their trip to Bournemouth on Monday night. \nBut the Brazilian picked up an injury in the opening exchanges in bizarre fashion forcing his departure from the field. \nAnd the Arsenal legend feels his injury was sustained as a result of modern football boots. Speaking on The Sun Football Podcast via Dreamteamfc , he said; \n\"The Gabriel Jesus injury has got to have something to do with the boots. \" \n\"These soft plastic boots that have come in, the feet have hardly any protection. It was a nothing incident .\" \n'Wrighty' feels sympathetic as well as drawing comparison to his meteoric rise to that of Manchester United's Marcus Rashford. \n\"You have to feel for him because in terms of a start, only Marcus Rashford has started as blisteringly as that .\" \nThe 19-year-old is set to jet off to Spain for special treatment as he's expected to miss the remainder of the Premier League campaign.
