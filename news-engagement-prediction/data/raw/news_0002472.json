The six-hour drive cost only 29,000 Iraqi Dinars or about $22. The drives were likely runs to pick up supplies or hold operational meetings. \nAnother slip of paper on ISIS stationary bills a Mosul-based passenger, likely an ISIS fighter, for gas purchased in the Syrian city of Raqqa — the de factor capital of the ISIS group. \nRelated: Syrian Mother of ISIS Victim Allowed Back Into U.S.: 'Not My Fault I'm Muslim' \nStacks of papers also testify that the group kept close tabs of utilities such as electricity and internet usage. Monthly cards bearing users' internet names and passwords were filed with the base's expenses. \nWhile internet and mobile phones were strictly outlawed under ISIS in Mosul to prevent civilians from becoming government informants, the internet receipts suggest ISIS used centralized internet connections across the city. \nISIS-held territory in and around Mosul and in Anbar has significantly shrunk over the past months — the roads fighters once easily traveled by taxi in early 2016 are now dotted with government checkpoints and airstrike craters. \nThe western half of Mosul, which is still under ISIS control, is almost entirely cut off from territory the militants hold in Syria. In Mosul's east, the abandoned ISIS bases sit ransacked by security forces, intelligence officers and curious neighbors.
