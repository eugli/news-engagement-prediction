The increase was fueled by Asia as nations in the region are addressing rising tensions. \nThe global volume of international transfers of major weapons increased by 8.4% in 2012 to 2016 compared to the previous five years. Imports of weapons by states in Asia and Oceania increased by 7.7% in the same period and accounted for 43% of global imports. \nIndia, which is locked in a geopolitical struggle with neighboring Pakistan and China, was the largest importer of weapons in the period, accounting for 13% of the global total. India increased its arms imports by 43% compared to the previous five years. China was the number four importer of arms, making up 4.5% of global imports, and Pakistan ranked ninth, making up 3.2%. \nImports by Southeast Asian countries, some of which are embroiled in territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea, increased 6.2%. The surprise country was Vietnam, which jumped from the 29th-largest importer from 2007 to 2011 to the tenth this term, with arms imports increasing by 202%. Close \nIn terms of arms exports, China made the leap from being the sixth-largest exporter to third in 2012-2016, with its share in global exports rising from 3.8% to 6.2%. The top exporter was the U.S., making up just over a third of the global share. Russia came in second with 23% of the share, and 70% of its weapons exports went to just four countries: India, Vietnam, China and Algeria. \n\"With no regional arms control instruments in place, states in Asia continue to expand their arsenals,\" said Siemon Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure Programme. \n\"While China is increasingly able to substitute arms imports with indigenous products, India remains dependent on weapons technology from many willing suppliers, including Russia, the U.S., European states, Israel and South Korea,\" he added. \nSIPRI presents data in five-year periods because the delivery volumes can fluctuate significantly year-on-year.
