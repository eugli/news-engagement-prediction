Is it something we will continue to explore in the first half of 2017 and if our Members agree they would like to pursue it, then that's when the real work for Olympic inclusion begins,\" he stated.\nRichardson also said that the global body's endeavour remains to protect the integrity of the sport.\n\"Protecting the integrity of the sport, is of fundamental importance to everyone here at the ICC. We must continue to provide leadership and support in the global fight against corruption and we will complete the implementation of all agreed recommendations made by the Integrity Working Party.\n\"But protecting the integrity of cricket goes beyond our Anti-Corruption unit and we must ensure that our anti-doping programme is as effective as possible. We will introduce blood testing in 2017 as part of our ongoing commitment to a drug free sport and will continue to maintain our WADA compliance,\" Richardson wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T12:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T15:00:52.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
