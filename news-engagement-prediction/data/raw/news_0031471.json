(Kalin Mitchell/Facebook)\nThe storm will intensify Monday and will bring heavy snow, very strong northeasterly winds, and blowing snow resulting in blizzard conditions with near zero visibility to much of the southern half of the province.\nThe areas under blizzard warnings are expected to see snowfall amounts between 25 and 55 centimetres and winds gusting up to 100 km/h.\nThe highest snowfall amounts and strongest winds are forecast to be along the Fundy coast in St. Stephen and Grand Manan.\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least four hours.\nCBC meteorologist Kalin Mitchell said snowfall amounts are only one issue with this storm.\n\"Another will be the winds. East and Northeast gusts of 70-100 km/h (highest gusts on the coast) are projected to accompany the snow creating extensive blowing snow and drifts. Anticipate prolonged periods of very poor visibility on Monday. The strong winds will drive a rough and pounding surf. Be especially cautious during high tides on Monday.\"\nMitchell added this is a rapidly developing weather scenario and the forecast should be monitored frequently in the event of change.\nMore warnings Winter storm warnings have been issued for central N.B. with snowfall amounts between 15 and 25 centimetres and winds gusting up to 80 km/h.\nSpecial weather statements have been issued for parts of northeastern N.B. including Miramichi and the Acadian Peninsula.\npic.twitter.com/oC5tNAiz8r\nâ€” @NBEMO_OMUNB Environment Canada said there is still some uncertainty of the amount of snow accumulation over those regions.\n\"Gusty northeast winds will also give reduced visibilities in blowing snow over exposed area,\" the national weather service advised in its statement.\nThe snow will taper to flurries Monday evening and the winds will gradually diminish Monday night as the low continues to move east.\n\"Travel is expected to be extremely hazardous due to widespread poor visibility. Travel is not recommended,\" said Environment Canada in its warning.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/NBEMO_OMUNB/status/830756358890872833", "https://t.co/oC5tNAiz8r"], "published": "2017-02-12T18:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T17:32:55.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
