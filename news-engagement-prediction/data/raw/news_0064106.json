Pointing to the U.K., which has – so far – felt a relatively benign impact from its Brexit vote, Le Pen has relied on it as a basis for rallying support during her campaigning, saying: \"They told us that Brexit would be a catastrophe, that the stock markets would crash … The reality is that none of that happened.\" \nHowever, Deutsche Bank has warned of the inconsistencies of likening the two votes. An EU referendum in France, one of the founding members of the economic bloc, runs the risk of undermining the euro, the currency shared by 19 of the EU's 28 member states. \n\"Make no mistake, there is the world of difference between tearing up bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, and, unwinding a monetary union as far reaching in scope as the EMU (economic and monetary union) project,\" Deutsche Bank said in a note Tuesday. \n\"It is the difference between a benign global risk event and something that has the potential to go beyond a 'Lehman's moment'.\" Chesnot | Getty Images \nTurning into a 'nightmare' \nThe frictionless interaction enjoyed by countries within the European Monetary Union would turn into it a \"nightmare\", says Deutsche Bank, as a lack of a currency hedge would make all EMU members vulnerable to currency weakness. \nThe bank estimates that assets shared between the economic bloc plus liabilities totaled 46 trillion euros ($48.5 trillion) at the end of the third quarter 2016. This it describes as an \"upper bound estimate of EMU exposure that would have no hedge, and be exposed to currency risk in the event of an EMU break-up.\" \nIn addition, foreign exchange balances, held by corporations, financials and households, while only a fraction of this figure, have the capacity to \"cascade through the financial system, with unprecedented implications for global risk,\" according to the bank. \nInvestment bank Lehman Brothers is responsible for the U.S.'s largest ever bankruptcy filing, triggering the start of the 2008 financial crisis. It held assets of $600 billion – a fraction of the estimated $46 trillion at risk under a break-up of the EMU. \nWhile central banks could be expected to step in to secure the system, as they did during the 2008 crash, the long lead times and multiple legal obstacles of an EMU break-up would do little to manage the immediate aftermath of such a wide-reaching crash, said Deutsche Bank. \n\"It would be tough to squeeze the toothpaste back into the tube,\" it said.

I do believe that there is a very high chance that Europe has a chance for revival so my personal view on 'Frexit' is that it is a scenario with low probability today,\" he said.
