Could you help me?‚Äù \nLt. B.J. Gruber responded, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù \nShe shared the math problem she was struggling with.‚ÄúWell I don‚Äôt understand (8+29)x15.‚Äù \n‚ÄúDo the numbers in the parenthesis first so in essence it would be 37 x 15,‚Äù Gruber responded. \nShe then asked a follow up question: ‚ÄúOk now if I had this (90+27) + (29+15) x 2. Which one would I do first? Because you have to do the parenthesis first.‚Äù \nGruber explained, ‚ÄúTake the answer from the first parenthesis plus the answer from the second parenthesis and multiply that answer times two. Work left to right doing the work inside the parenthesis first.‚Äù \nLena‚Äôs mother, Molly, shared the heartwarming post to Facebook and thanked the police department for ‚Äòtruly building relationships with the community.‚Äô \nHer post has now been shared over 2,600 times. \nMarion, Ohio PD thanked everyone for the support, but admitted the homework advice may have actually been incorrect. \n‚ÄúHoping it is truly the thought that counts since apparently I cannot! Especially since the answer was wrong, it was very nice for Molly to acknowledge our attempt to help her daughter with some math homework! We do aim to be a full service police department after all. Have to say this is the first time we have been asked by a young Facebook follower to help with homework through messenger but hey, we SERVE and protect. Maybe should have mentioned that History was my favorite subject before answering. Well, we know now! üòä‚Äù Kristina Dougherty Kristina Dougherty joined CBS 3 in 2012 as a newsroom assistant and became a member of the CBS Philly digital content production team in 2013.
