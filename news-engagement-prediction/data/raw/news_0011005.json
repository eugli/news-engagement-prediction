Robert Reich “wouldn’t bet against it” This all comes after a canceled speech from Breitbart's Milo Yinnopoulos at the University of California, Berkeley Topics: berkeley , Breitbart , Donald Trump , Milo Yinnopoulos , RobertReich.org , Steve Bannon , Media News , Politics News FILE - In this Jan. 25, 2017 file photo, Milo Yiannopoulos speaks on campus in the Mathematics building at the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colo. Sales are soaring for, \"Dangerous,\" the upcoming book by the right-wing commentator. The book, scheduled to come out March 14. was in the top 10 on Amazon as of Thursday afternoon, a day after violent protests led the University of California, Berkeley to cancel his scheduled talk. (Jeremy Papasso/Daily Camera via AP, File) (Credit: AP) This originally appeared on Robert Reich's blog . \nThe events at the University of California, Berkeley, Wednesday night have been a boon to Milos Yiannopoulos, of Breitbart News, and to Steve Bannon, formerly head of Breitbart News and now Donald Trump’s consigliere. \nAs you may know, on Feb. 1 Berkeley gave Yiannopoulos a major forum to spout his racist and misogynistic vitriol. But police had to cancel the talk because about 150 masked agitators threw Molotov cocktails, smashed windows where Yiannopoulos was scheduled to speak, and threw rocks and fireworks at the police — delivering made-for-TV images of a riot. \nAccording to a promotional Breitbart story that ran before the event, Yiannopoulos was going to “ call for the withdrawal of federal grants and the prosecution of university officials who endanger their students with their policies.” \nWhich is exactly what Trump did via tweet early the next morning: “If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view — NO FEDERAL FUNDS?” \nThursday night, Yiannopoulos had a friendly interview on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” — a show that, according to The Washington Post , has ridden anger at left-wing activism into best-in-class primetime ratings. \nYiannopoulos wasn’t asked about the content of the speech that was shut down. The conversation focused instead on how Berkeley proved the point that the left was ceding its right to federal grants by cracking down on free speech. \nThat raises the possibility that Yiannopoulos and Breitbart were in cahoots with the agitators, perhaps in order to lay the groundwork for a Trump crackdown on universities and their federal funding. \nThursday night on CNN, I said “I wouldn’t bet against” that possibility. Almost immediately an indignant article appeared in Breitbart News, misleadingly headlined “Robert Reich Lies, Claims Breitbart News Organized Berkeley Riots.” \nHmmm. Connect these dots: \n1) Yinnopoulos writes for Breitbart News, which Steve Bannon ran before joining Trump’s team. \n2) Before Yiannopoulos was set to speak at Berkeley, Breitbart published an article saying that Yiannopoulos will call for the withdrawal of federal grants and the prosecution of university officials who endanger their students with their policies. \n3) Berkeley opened its doors to Yiannopoulos, but campus police had to cancel the event because of masked agitators. \n4) Hours later, Trump issued a misleading tweet, accusing the university of not allowing free speech and promoting violence against innocent people with different views, and threatening to withhold federal funds. \n5) The next night, Yiannopoulos said on Fox News that the incident proves universities like Berkeley — who, he argued, cracks down on free speech — don’t deserve federal grants. \n6) That same night, on CNN, I raise the possibility that Yiannopoulos and Breitbart could have been collaborating with the agitators. This generates a belligerent column in Breitbart with a misleading headline calling me a liar for claiming that Breitbart organized the riots. \nI don’t want to add to the conspiratorial musings of so many about this very conspiratorial administration, but there may be something worrying going on here. \nI wouldn’t bet against it.
