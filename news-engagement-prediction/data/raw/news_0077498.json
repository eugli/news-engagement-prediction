The balance is set for a new grant funding product to be launched in April,\" he added.\n\nAzman said DEQ800 could serve as an alternative to stimulating the growth of high-potential tech start-ups and make the early stage funding ecosystem in the country more robust.\n\nThe maximum investment duration per company is seven years, he said.\n\nThe focus investment sectors are financial services, tourism, business service, electrical and electronics, wholesale and retail, education, healthcare, communications content and infrastructure, oil, gas and energy, agriculture, information and communications technology (ICT) and non-ICT sectors.\n\nTargeted and potential investee companies are start-ups with tech-based products or services. They must have been in operation for less than five years and have at least a 51% ownership by Malaysians.\n\nThe companies must also own all the rights, titles and interest in the intellectual property relating to the prototype, products and/or services for the purpose of commercialisation, as well as limited by shares and total revenue of not more than RM5 million.\n\nSince its inception in 2003, Cradle has helped over 700 Malaysian tech start-ups and holds the highest commercialisation rate among government grants in the country. - Bernama", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:44:33.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
