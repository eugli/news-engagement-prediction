Not a single Democrat was present. \nWe as medical students at Price’s alma mater, University of Michigan Medical School, share many of the concerns that prompted the boycott, which Democrats implemented following a report from the Wall Street Journal that Price had falsely denied purchasing “privileged” stock options during his testimony before the Senate Finance Committee. As Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed out during the hearing, Price’s broader decision to “actively trade in health stocks while writing policy that could affect them raises serious questions about potential conflicts of interest and about [his] judgment.” \nPrice’s failure to disclose his financial interests, along with his political record, concern us as medical students. His positions are inconsistent with what we are taught in our medical training. \nRoughly a year ago at a public University of Michigan event , Price expressed concern when asked about the possibility of a Donald Trump presidency. “When I hear Trump saying things like ‘I’ll just do XYZ’ without seemingly any regard for the legislative branch, it gives me some thought.” \nJust days into Trump’s presidency it seems that Price’s concerns were correct, and yet, he has remained silent after recent executive orders that demonstrate contempt for constitutional checks and balances. \nAs future physicians, we are also concerned about Price’s values. Price’s political record demonstrates a disregard for patient welfare, which should be absolutely disqualifying for the position of Secretary of HHS. It also stands in stark contrast to what we are taught each day in medical school. \nPrice opposes even modest restrictions on the sale of automatic weapons and ammunition designed to reduce gun-related deaths, despite research that the presence of a gun in the home greatly increases the risk of homicide and suicide. This evidence is strong enough that the relationship between firearms and suicide is tested on our exams. \nPrice voted against reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in 2013, and he has voted against legalizing gay marriage and legislation protecting LGBTQ victims of hate crimes. As third- and fourth-year students, we are taught to ask our patients if they feel safe at home, and how to connect them with resources if they are in a dangerous situation. \nPrice is a member of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a fringe group that opposes Medicare and Medicaid has raised questions about mandatory vaccinations. Price opposes federal funding for Planned Parenthood, one of the nation’s leading providers of screenings for cancer and sexually transmitted infections, and has repeatedly voted to limit access to vital reproductive health services, including contraception and abortion. Just this month, first year medical students learned about the importance of pelvic exams and cervical cancer screenings, and how to perform them. \nPrice voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Every day we see patients who are afraid of reduced access to medications they need, high co-pays for life-saving procedures, and losing their health insurance entirely. Price has also remained silent on Trump’s immigration ban, which has already prevented international physicians with valid visas from returning to the United States. \nIndividually, many of these positions are in direct conflict with our medical education, and in aggregate, they are inconsistent with physician values and best practices to assure the health and well being of the patients we serve. Price’s record reveals a politician bent on reducing federal regulation in healthcare and a disregard for the interests of patients. These actions violate the ethical responsibilities of a physician, which include ensuring that all people, including the elderly, veterans, women, the LGBTQ community, immigrants, victims of violence, and all patients who are economically and socially disadvantaged can easily access high-quality, affordable health care. Price’s conflicts of interest and voting record contradict our values as future physicians and students of University of Michigan Medical School. We urge the Senate to reject Price’s nomination to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \nThe authors are joined by Ann Soliman, Hannah Cottrell, Whit Froehlich, also students at the University of Michigan Medical School, in signing on to this guest column. 37 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:00:04.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
