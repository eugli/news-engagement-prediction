Image: supplied. \nOnline retailing pioneer Ruslan Kogan’s Kogan.com is smashing its prospectus predictions for earnings in its first year of listing, posting pro forma trading EBITA of $7.3 million in the first half of FY17. \nThe prospectus forecast a full year profit of $6.9 million for its first year of listed operation. \nPro forma net profit after tax for the six months more than doubled on the previous year to $3.7 million, also beating the full year prospectus forecast of $2.5 million. \nThe online purelplay retailer will pay its first dividend, of 3.9 cents per share, fully franked, as a result. \nIn issuing a dividend, Kogan.com has beaten bigger, high-profile rivals such as Amazon and Jack Ma’s Alibaba to the punch. \nThe eponymous founder and CEO said: “We are pleased to deliver results for our shareholders that exceed full year prospectus earnings forecasts and demonstrate that we are on track to continue to build the Kogan.com business in line with our long term business strategy”. \nKogan.com will upgrade its EBITDA after revenue grew by 37.3% to $143.9 million in first-half FY17, compared to the same period a year earlier. \nPro forma trading EBITDA is now estimated at between $10.5 million and $11.5 million for FY17. \nThe business says it now has an active customer base of 830,000 people, up 18.2% in six months and 37% in 2016. \nGross margin was 18% — beating the prospectus forecast by 2.8 percentage points. The company says investing in systems and analytics, as well as strong growth in Kogan Mobile and “precision purchasing” for Private Label inventory helped increase the margin. \nAt December 31, the business had a net cash position of $26.5 million and inventory levels of $42.4 million, saying 90% of that stock is less than 90 days old. \nLast year Kogan and his business partner and CFO David Shafer floated the business, raising $50 million at $1.80 a share, while retaining just over half the company and pocketing $7.5 million cash from the listing. \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
