Sister Pie paczki. Courtesy of Sister Pie With Fat Tuesday — better known as Paczki Day in metro Detroit — right around the corner West Village bakehouse Sister Pie is preparing to unleash a whole new lineup of fried-and-filled dough flavors. Paczki fanatics can look forward to jasmine passionfruit, maple coffee cream, and “pieraczki” (savory pierogi-flavored paczki) in this year’s batch of polish doughnuts. Unlike many shops around Detroit, Sister Pie’s paczki are notoriously first come, first served and no pre-orders are accepted, so lucky patrons will have to get their early. The 2016 batch sold out in less than two hours . Customers are limited to one dozen for $36 or individuals for $4 up to six per person. Courtesy of Sister Pie In past years owner Lisa Ludwinski has utilized nearby restaurant fryers, but this time around she’ll be renting out Norma G’s food truck to streamline the late-night paczki frying process.
