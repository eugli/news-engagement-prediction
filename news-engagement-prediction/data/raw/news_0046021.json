Staff Photographer Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott (4) is pictured calling signals at the line of scrimmage during the New York Giants vs. the Dallas Cowboys NFL football game at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on Sunday, September 11, 2016.

Tap here. \nFormer Patriots staff member on Dak Prescott, comparisons to Brady ... \nTom Shaw: Tom Brady, realizes there's 30 coaches, staff, equipment managers, trainers - but they all have families. Some people have five kids. Some people have no kids. But all those people are getting fired because you're the franchise quarterback, and Dak understands that because he listened to other guys tell him that. \nThis has to be the most important thing in your life in order for you to be successful. It has to be the most important thing in your life. And it helps everybody that's at your facility. And when you've got guys that are clowns and they don't train at the facility, they're more interested in social media ... it's not going to help you. But if this is the most important thing - you're trying to learn about defense, you're trying to learn as much as you can about coverages - Dak has done that ... Dak wants to learn. He's willing to learn. Where some guys that are franchise quarterbacks, it's not the most important thing in their life, and it has to be. Former Patriots coach: Dak Prescott has everything Bill Belichick looks for; he√Ç compares favorably to Tom Brady \nThe Bill Beli-checklist... \nMachota: [Bill] Belichick's going to know if a guy can play football or not, but he wants to know about the behind the scenes stuff. And four of the things that Tom specifically mentioned were - Are they hard workers? Are they intelligent? Do they show up on time? Are they coachable? And, as he says, Dak has everything on that checklist. \nWhere Prescott could improve in Year 2? \nMachota: One of the things that would jump out to me is just maybe some better play against division opponents. It seemed like when these division opponents - you're seeing a team twice in one year - those are some of the games he struggled in. Yeah, they've got more film on him, but then he's also got a lot more film and tendencies on what those team's do. So, I think you could see some improvement there. \nOne of the things that I think would be kind of interesting that could happen is Dak could have an even better sophomore year and have more turnovers. \n... \nGeorge: He's going to know the Cowboys' system better. He's going to know when to check in or out of a play better so he can get you in a better position at the line of scrimmage. I think all those things are a natural progression for a second-year quarterback. \nYou mentioned the downfield passing, I think he could be better as far as taking more shots or when to take the shot ... but when you look at the rookie season, you're nitpicking really because he was so good in his rookie season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:58:07.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
