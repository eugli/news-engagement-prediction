She wants to be in love again, but it may not be in the cards. T.I. has hurt her and she is trying to put the pieces of their romance back together but it is really challenging.” \nCredit: Instagram \nThe source adds the reality star desperately wants to feel “special and in love” again, ideally with T.I., but even with someone new if things simply don’t work out. \n“Tiny desperately wants to feel special and in love again, if not with T.I., with someone. She simply does not have the time or the energy to be dating someone new while she is still invested in possibly making things work with the father of her children.” \nCredit: Instagram \nOther sources claim the 41-year-old is putting all of her energy into her children and business ventures to help distract from the pain. \nLast month, Tiny admitted on camera she wanted the 36-year-old rapper to “come on home, baby,” after she was asked if she missed him during an Instagram Live stream. \nCredit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images \nT.I. was recently seen walking a Super Bowl red carpet alongside Kristen Ingram , setting off rumors that he was dating the gorgeous NFL executive. \nHe’s denied these claims, but reportedly even Tiny felt some kind of way after seeing them together just one month after their separation. \nCredit: T.I. Instagram \n“He keeps telling Tiny that he and Kristen are just friends, and that he regrets taking photos with her. All T.I. wants is to have a nice Valentine’s Day with Tiny and the kids. He gave her flowers but she rolled her eyes and walked away” \n\nDo you believe these two will reconcile?
