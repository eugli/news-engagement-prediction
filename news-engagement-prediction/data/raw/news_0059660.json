Now, they leave it up to individual schools and classrooms. (CBC)\nMaxim Montreuil, in Grade 7, said he liked to use his phone's Google Translate app. And he expressed concern about leaving the device in a locker all day.\n\"They should have a basket where you can put your phones in, because anyone could just break into your locker,\" he said.\nGrade 7 student Tiernan Jory cut straight to the chase: \"It's sad, there's your answer.\"\n'Finding that balance' The school board had a blanket ban on cell phones until 2011, but then decided to let the schools make up their own systems.\n\"It's about finding that balance between harnessing the power of technology and how it engages kids, and at the same time it can be a massive distraction,\" said Bird, the board spokesman.\nHe said that the TDSB encourages using technology in class when it fits into a lesson or project. The board also owns tablets and laptops to help students get better acquainted with working online.\nTDSB spokesman Ryan Bird said educators are being challenged to find a balance between teaching about technology and student distraction. (CBC)\nA responsibility to teach technology? Earl Grey's approach stands in contrast to that of other schools around the Greater Toronto Area, particularly at the Peel District School Board.\nIn 2013, the board added Wi-Fi connectivity to all 240 of its schools. It also introduced a policy that encourages students to bring cellphones and tablets to school.\nThe board's co-ordinating principal of modern learning said that the distraction issue has to be managed like any other, but not at the expense of giving kids access to technology.\nLawrence DeMaeyer said that the Peel board feels that it's essential to prepare students to use the technology they'll need out in the world.\n\"If we ignore or exclude those tools from the classroom, I think we're kind of avoiding our responsibility.\"\nWith files from Adrian Cheung", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/A7zHdGfN530"], "published": "2017-02-22T01:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:56:23.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
