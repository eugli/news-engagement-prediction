Taking to his own IG page, Game took a moment to address what he felt was a disrespectful move on Meek's part, and as we've come to expect from the Compton rapper, did so with a lengthy caption along with some lengthy hashtags. \nThis the type of hoe shit I hate... This lil bitch @meekmill aka Meesha salty cause his woman left em. Instead of being a REAL NIGGA & leaving the situation with ya head up standing tall, you in ya feelings so you get her house robbed & do fuck nigga shit fronting for the followers she gave you... liking pictures & leaving comments on posts that disrespect the woman who gave you life, actually loved yo dusty ass, bought you shit you couldn't ever afford on yo own & even stood by your side when Drizzy bodied you.. instead of leaving yo bum ass like she should've, she held yo skinny rat face havin ass down !!! \nOf course, this isn't the first time Game has targeted Meek in this kind of post. The two rappers had a long-winded beef last year which may have had some impact on Game's decision to drag Meek on the timeline today.All of this stems from Remy Ma's \"ShETHER\" track which takes some very personal digs at Nicki. The song was a response to subliminal disses on Nicki Minaj's recent verses for \"Make Love\" and \"Swalla,\" which are thought to have been directed at Remy.View The Game's full caption and the original meme posted by Ebro below.
