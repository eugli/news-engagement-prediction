They’re just like us! \nFollowing the uproar surrounding West Elm’s Peggy sofa , Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard have found themselves at odds over their own piece of furniture: a La-Z-Boy recliner. \nOn Tuesday, Shepard posted a photo of himself reclining in the leather chair, along with a caption explaining his argument. \n“My wife, in an attempt to discredit my character, will be posting a similar picture, but with the expressed intention of attacking my sense of style in home furnishings,” he wrote. “The proof of this Lazyboy’s aesthetic appeal is written all over my face. #getcomfy #functionbeforefashion ” A post shared by Dax Shepard (@daxshepard) on Feb 21, 2017 at 4:18pm PST \nThe following day, Bell did , in fact, post a response to provide her side of the story. \n“This is not a bit. @daxshepard has sincerely suggested the new home for the lazy boy from his office be in the center of my living room,” she wrote. “He made an adorable argument about how epic his TV viewing experience will be if I let him keep it there. The man has lost his mind. #chiphappens ” A post shared by kristen bell (@kristenanniebell) on Feb 22, 2017 at 3:24pm PST \nAs many couples know, trying to decide on decor for your home is never easy. (This writer speaks from experience.) This is why we love Bell and Shepard ― they’re just a typical couple that sometimes argues over silly things. (Stars! They’re just like us!) \nThere is one thing we want to know though: Who won?
