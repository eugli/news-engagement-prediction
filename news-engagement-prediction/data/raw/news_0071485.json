Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, which led them to mistakenly crown La La Land the winner.\nPWC did not confirm which card Beatty and Dunaway had been handed in error, but reports claim it was the one announcing Emma Stone's earlier win as Best Actress for La La Land, rather than the correct Best Picture winner card.\nWarren Beatty holding up the correct Best Picture winner (Photo: AFP) The card
