Follow Live here.   Subhasish Dutta A + A - Reuters Photo \nHello and welcome to our Live coverage of the Day 1 of the one-off Test between India and Bangladesh in Hyderabad. Stay tuned as we bring you all the latest updates. ( LIVE SCORECARD ) \n10.15 IST: This is Bangladesh's 98th Test match and their first in India. This goes to show how much Bangladesh needs to play Test cricket in order to improve in their record in the format. However, past couple of years have been good for them in terms of overall cricketing point of view. \n10.12 IST: FOUR! Not convincing from Vijay! Banged in short on middle, he goes for the pull but wasn't in control at all. The ball flew off his glove down the leg side. The fine leg fielder was quite square and so he got a boundary. Probing over from Rabbi ends. IND 24/1 in 8 overs \n10.01 IST: FOUR! FINDS THE FENCE! Fuller ball outside off, width on offer from Rabbi and Pujara obliges with a square drive through backward point. It did seem initially that it came off the outer half but he had it in control. First boundary of the Indian innings. IND 13/1 in 6 overs \n9.59 IST: Good stuff early on from Bangladesh fast bowlers Taskin Ahmed and Kamrul Islam Rabbi. They have been impressive with their line and length. Bangladesh's fast bowling coach Courtney Walsh must be happy with the effort. AP Photo \n9.41 IST: Sunil Gavaskar rightly points out that it is always important for a Test opener to spent time in the middle. You have the opportunity to have dot balls in Test cricket. \"It's a five-day game and not a limited-overs match,\" laments Gavaskar after watching Rahul's dismissal. Reuters Photo \n9.36 IST: OUT! Bowled! Taskin removes KL Rahul (2) in the first over. What a start for Bangladesh to the Test match! Rahul will consider himself slightly unlucky but it wasn't a wise shot to start with. Full ball outside off, he goes for the lazy drive without any footwork. Gets a thick inside edge that cannons on to his back leg before disturbing the stumps. Taskin is pumped up and why shouldn't he be? Perfect start for the tourists. IND 2/1 in 1 over. Pujara walks in next \n9.30 IST: The players and umpires are making their way out to the middle after the National Anthems of the two teams. KL Rahul and Murali Vijay to open the batting for India. \n9.25 IST: Karun Nair is only the fourth player in history to sit out of the next Test after scoring a Triple century. Reuters Photo Players sitting out of next Test (for any reason) after scoring a triple-ton:Andy SandhamLen HuttonInzamam-ul-HaqKARUN NAIR #IndvBan â€” Rajneesh Gupta (@rgcricket) February 9, 2017 \n9.15 IST: Playing XIs: \nIndia: Murali Vijay, Lokesh Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli (C), Ajinkya Rahane, Wriddhiman Saha (WK), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja , Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma \nBangladesh: Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mominul Haque, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim (WK/C), Sabbir Rahman, Mehedi Hasan, Taijul Islam, Taskin Ahmed, Kamrul Islam Rabbi \n9.10 IST: Virat Kohli: We would like to bat first. Looks like a pretty nice surface to bat on. A hard surface, an even covering of grass and should be nice to bat on. Hyderabad has always been a good batting wicket. It is hard and the fast bowlers do get some help out here if they bowl in the right areas and today promises to be no different. For us the opposition is not something we focus on, we focus on executing our skills and executing our plans. We would like to go ahead and play this Test match with the same mindset. We are playing with five bowlers and unfortunately Karun misses out. Ajinkya Rahane comes back in. Bhuvi, Umesh and Ishant are the three quicks along with Ashwin and Jadeja. \nMushfiqur Rahim: A great moment for Bangladesh cricket and hopefully we would put up a good performance against the number one team in the world. We learnt a couple of things from the last match, a couple of mistakes cost us the game against NZ. We have to keep our momentum up for all five days and we learnt some key lessons out there. The wicket would be pretty good for the first two days and the spinners will come in later. We are going in with two quicks, two spinners and seven batsmen. . @imVkohli wins the toss and elects to bat first in the one-off Test against @BCBtigers at Hyderabad #INDvBAN pic.twitter.com/6K9UesrQg4 â€” BCCI (@BCCI) February 9, 2017 9.00 IST: India win toss, opt to bat against Bangladesh in Hyderabad. Ajinkya Rahane replaces Chennai Test triple centurion Karun Nair. Jayant Yadav too has been left out. \nVirat Kohli might be on a high as a captain and as a batsman, especially in Test cricket but that does not mean he is taking Bangladesh lightly. AP Photo \n8.50 IST: Ravichandran Ashwin two wickets short of becoming fastest to reach 250 Test wickets \nAshwin is now just two wickets away from becoming the fastest bowler to take 250 Test wickets. He has so far picked up 248 wickets in 44 Test matches at an average of 24.96 including 24 five-wicket hauls. Australian fast bowling legend Dennis Lillee, who holds the record, reached the 250-mark in 48 matches. AP Photo \nVirat Kohli is not only the most popular cricketer in India right now but is also considered to be the best of his generation by past and present players as well. AP Photo \n8.35 IST: India invincible: Bangladesh yet to win a Test against their big brother \nIncidentally, India were Bangladesh's first opponents in their inaugural Test. After that, over the next 15 years, the countries faced off only seven more times in Test cricket. It is time for the first-ever Test on Indian soil against Bangladesh and the boys are ready. #TeamIndia #INDvBAN pic.twitter.com/vinHsMqhjN â€” BCCI (@BCCI) February 9, 2017 \n8.30 IST: India and Bangladesh have played only eight Tests so far - all in Bangladesh - with India winning six encounters.Two matches have ended in stalemate. \nBrief Preview: India played against Bangladesh in their first Test match back in November 2000. \nSourav Ganguly was captain of a powerful Indian side that had in its ranks Shiv Sundar Das and Sadagopan Ramesh as openrs. The middle-order consited of Rahul Dravid , Sachin Tendulkar alongside Ganguly. Sunil Joshi, Ajit Agarkar, Murali Karthik and Javagal Srinath were still part of the bowling attack with a young and quick Zaheer Khan. \nExactly 195 months later, a completely different-looking India squad braces up to play Bangladesh in their first Test on Indian soil.
