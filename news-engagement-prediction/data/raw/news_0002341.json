In 2016 we saw the warmest ocean temperatures on record.”\nThe persistent heat has been aggravated by dry conditions since October caused by a high-pressure system sitting over the Tasman Sea, which has increased westerly winds moving over southern Australia .\n“We’ve also had warm offshore sea surface temperatures – that also keeps conditions warmer, particularly at night,” Imielska said. “As a result we have seen that back-to-back heat and the lack of relief – the surprising thing is that there haven’t been any really cool days.”\nSydney conditions are due to heat up again over the next few days with the mercury expected to hit 37C in the city and 43C in the west on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T11:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:49:15.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
