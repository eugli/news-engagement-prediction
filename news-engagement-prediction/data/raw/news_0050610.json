Wilson, the investor behind The Hall on Franklin, a restaurant collective under construction just up the street from Foundation, would routinely stop customers to ask where they were coming from. 11 photos Heights Fish Camp is a seafood restaurant and raw bar concept from Tampa restaurateur… more Their answers were both surprising and reassuring: Foundation's customers were coming from nearby historic neighborhoods and suburbs as far as a 30-minute drive away. \"It was amazing to hear people were coming from everywhere,\" Wilson said. \"It made me feel a lot better. When you're trying to create a destination place, you get a little nervous, but Foundation’s doing a great job.\" Wilson, who sold off his mortgage company Leverage Financial in 2013, is seeking to recreate the kind of food hall experience that's become ubiquitous in other cities as a place to showcase the local culinary scene. Typical construction delays have kept the Hall on Franklin a bit behind schedule — it was originally slated to open by the end of 2016 — but Wilson and his team have been working to evolve the vision for Hall on Franklin, an 8,000-square-foot space at 1701 N. Franklin St. He's signed on two new concepts and made two of the biggest names in Tampa's food scene partners in the Hall. Ty Beddingfield , former master barista at Buddy Brew Coffee , and mixologist Ro Patel now have ownership stakes in the Hall. Lindsay Dixon , who was previously with Station House in St. Petersburg, has been hired as director of operations. When it opens, the Hall will employ 55 to 60 servers. (Patrons will order via iPad, from all of the kiosks, and have food delivered to their tables.) Poke Rose, a Hawaiian poke bowl concept from Jason Cline, the former executive chef at The Birch & Vine in downtown St. Petersburg, has replaced a Latin Fusion concept in the hall. Dave Burton , the Tampa restaurateur who is also doing The Melt Shoppe in the hall, has signed on to do another concept: Heights Fish Camp, which features seafood and a raw bar. A post shared by The Melt Shoppe (@meltshoppe) on Feb 6, 2017 at 10:04am PST Some might see it as a risk to have the same restaurateur behind two of the seven kiosks in the hall, but Wilson says he's more than comfortable with Burton, who's a partner in Tampa Pizza Co., Holy Hog Barbecue and SoFresh, among other concepts. \"To be honest with you, if it wasn’t Dave, yes [I'd be nervous],\" Wilson said. \"I'm more humbled that he'd be willing to do two concepts in the hall. When Dave Burton believes in something, you know you have something going.\" Beyond Heights Fish Camp and Poke Rose, these concepts will be part of the Hall: The North Star Eatery: Asian Fusion concept by Kevin and Singh Hurt of Anise Global Bistro Bar Kȯ-fē: A coffee bar — craft coffee, coffee cocktails, coffee beers — by Beddingfield Bake ’N’ Babes: Desserts and confectionery by Julie Curry The Collection: Bespoke cocktails by Patel The Melte Shoppe: Savory melted sandwiches and old-fashioned milkshakes Although Foundation is thriving, Tampa Heights — and this particular corridor of North Franklin Street — is far from a bustling neighborhood. But Wilson says he's encouraged by the crowds that Ulele and Water Works Park, just a few blocks away, regularly draw. The revitalization of Armature Works, which will add event space and another market hall to the neighborhood, and the construction of The Pearl, an apartment building, will also help build critical mass on the northern end of the urban core. Wilson says he's already starting to see signs of life in the neighborhood, including a woman who stopped by the Hall with a double stroller to ask, \"What's going on in here?\" \"She said, 'I will be your No. 1 customer.' It’s a great sign of things to come,\" he said. \"There are a lot of new families in Tampa Heights. I’m really encouraged by that, and I see people moving into Tampa Heights every day.\" Ashley Gurbal Kritzer is senior reporter for the Tampa Bay Business Journal.
