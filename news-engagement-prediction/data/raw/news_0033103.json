The 19-year-old duly hobbled down the touchline to be replaced by Sergio Agüero, who would go on to force home the visitors’ second goal off Tyrone Mings, just after the hour to secure City a fourth successive win in all competitions.\nCity’s medical staff will examine Jesus on Tuesday to ascertain the extent of the damage sustained. “We will know exactly what is wrong in the morning,” said Guardiola. “Hopefully, and I will pray tonight, it will not be a big issue. But I’m so happy for Sergio, for how he played, how he tried, and I thought he had scored. He hadn’t played the last few games because these three guys – Gabriel Jesus, Leroy Sané and Raheem Sterling – were amazing but Sergio was important for us before this game and he is still important for us now.”\nSergio Agüero makes his point in Manchester City’s win at Bournemouth Read more\nThe win hoisted City to second in the table, though Guardiola remains painfully realistic about their chances of reeling in Chelsea. “It’s so difficult,” he said. “They’d have to lose three games and we have to win all our games, and you know how difficult that is in the Premier League. So we have to go game by game, narrow the gap as we go. I watched Chelsea’s game at Burnley on Sunday and that was an amazing performance from Burnley, but still Chelsea played really well. So all we can do is look to continue to improve.\n“I was so, so happy with this result. We made a real performance and, in the last 10 to 15 minutes, we did things the right way to make the result certain with a thousand million passes. David Silva passed and passed with Kevin [de Bruyne] and Fernandinho, and that’s the best way to control the counterattacks.\n“It’s the first time this year we’ve done that, controlling the game against a side who are difficult if you let them run at you. We did it well at the beginning of the season but, after that, we lost something. I know why. Our game has been more stable since the Arsenal and Tottenham games. But we are improving. Now we have to keep this good momentum.”\nBournemouth have yet to win a game this calendar year but took heart from their display against a resurgent City. Yet their manager, Eddie Howe, was still left to curse injuries sustained by his captain, Simon Francis, and his loanee from Arsenal, Jack Wilshere, which will have to be assessed this week. “Jack is just feeling his ankle,” he said. “I don’t think there’s a major injury there. He just felt he couldn’t move as freely as he wanted to and had a pain in his ankle, so we took him off. Simon is feeling his hamstring again.But we needed a positive response to the Everton game [lost 6-3 last weekend] , and we got that. The attitude and motivation to the team was a very good level. Looking to the future, those are important characteristics to the team.\n“We need to get our bounce back and that will only come from a win. But that was a positive step forward.”\nManchester City Bournemouth Pep Guardiola Sergio Agüero Jack Wilshere news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Pep%20Guardiola%20will%20%E2%80%98pray%E2%80%99%20for%20Gabriel%20Jesus%20after%20striker%20is%20injured&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F14%2Fpep-guardiola-manchester-city-gabriel-jesus-injury-pray-bournemouth%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Pep%20Guardiola%20will%20%E2%80%98pray%E2%80%99%20for%20Gabriel%20Jesus%20after%20striker%20is%20injured&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F14%2Fpep-guardiola-manchester-city-gabriel-jesus-injury-pray-bournemouth", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F14%2Fpep-guardiola-manchester-city-gabriel-jesus-injury-pray-bournemouth%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F14%2Fpep-guardiola-manchester-city-gabriel-jesus-injury-pray-bournemouth", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F14%2Fpep-guardiola-manchester-city-gabriel-jesus-injury-pray-bournemouth%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;wwc=1"], "published": "2017-02-14T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:43:31.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
