With the less capable but supposedly more affordable nubia N1 lite, however, it is devoting some MWC 2017 space for it. Which is even more ironic considering the N1 lite is truly a “lite” version of the N1, though nubia promises that it has just enough features to be worth its cost. \nIf the nubia N1 was already a mid-range device, the N1 lite is unsurprisingly a small step lower. The company hasn’t spilled all the beans regarding the hardware, but its booth at Barcelona does shed some light. The N1 lite runs on a 1.5 GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6737 processor with 2 GB of RAM at least. Storage is a rather measly 16 GB and expansion isn’t much, up to 32 GB only. \nnubia does boast of a few interesting tidbits about the N1 lite, like its “finely textured” coating. Its “unipanel” at the back is simply shorthand for the rear camera atop the fingerprint scanner that is visually set apart from the rest of the back cover. \nThe N1 lite is billed as an affordable selfie cam, especially with a soft-light LED flash on the front, admittedly still a rare feature among smartphones. That said, the front camera is only 5 megapixels, so that might not be such a big thing. The rear 8 megapixel camera comes with an F2.0 lens and dual LED flash. \nHow affordable will it be? nubia isn’t saying yet, but it definitely will be lower than the $250 or so of the nubia N1. The nubia N1 lite launches at the end of March in Germany, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic, India, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:15:44.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
