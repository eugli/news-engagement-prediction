J0E MARTIN The city of Houston played host to one of the most historic Super Bowls of all time — including the first overtime in Super Bowl history. For Houston, it was the culmination of more than three-and-a-half years of planning, spending and retooling a city to handle one of the world's largest sporting events. More than 70,000 fans filed into NRG Stadium to watch the Atlanta Falcons take on the New England Patriots Feb. 5. The Patriots came back from a 28-3 deficit in the second half to win 34-28 in overtime, also the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history. It marked Patriots quarterback Tom Brady 's fifth Super Bowl championship, the most by any quarterback in 51 years. The 2017 Super Bowl was held Feb. 5 in Houston. J0E MARTIN The festivities showcased several cornerstones of Houston, including President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara Bush , who were greeted by a resounding standing ovation for the coin toss; astronauts being recognized during commercial breaks; and a little country twang mixed into the Star Spangled Banner. Lady Gaga started her halftime performance from the roof of NRG Stadium with a backdrop of drones colored in the formation of the American flag. She then “jumped” through the stadium through the roof, which was opened specially for the halftime show. Her performance was void of any wardrobe malfunctions, something that could not be said about the 2004 Super Bowl, the last time Houston hosted the big game. To prepare for the game , the Houston Super Bowl Host Committee brought together thousands of volunteers, a group of community and business leaders to lead various subcommittees and dozens of small businesses . Read all of the Houston Business Journal's Super Bowl coverage here. As for the festivities the week prior to the big game, attendance numbers are still being tallied. However, on its final night, Super Bowl Live reached capacity and shut its door, according to the host committee. The long-term success of this game won't be measured for some time. Will downtown remain a destination for Houstonians and visitors to the Bayou City with its new restaurants and other features ? Will the billions of estimated media impressions convince people from other parts of the country that Houston is more than an oil and gas town, but is a city of diversity, culture and activity? Have the various economic development groups succeeded in showcasing all Houston has to offer for prospective clients and companies to move business here? The city of Houston will have to wait and see. Joe Martin covers technology, money and law for the Houston Business Journal. Follow him on Twitter for more.
