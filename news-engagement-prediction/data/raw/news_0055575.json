Instead of picking up a measly shoe rack or over-the door organizer, consider the benefits of bookcase storage—think: they're tall, inexpensive, and roomy—for holding your kicks, clothes, purses, and just about anything else you'd used a dresser for. (Image credit: Submitted by Patricia ) Floating Shelves \nOne of the easiest ways to carve out more storage space in a small bedroom is with floating wall shelves . Along with creating much-needed room for storing sweaters, shoes, linens, baskets, and more, you can place them just about anywhere on your wall; no closet necessary! (Image credit: IKEA ) Upside-Down Shelf Brackets \nTurns out that with little more than a few shelf brackets ( the IKEA ones above are $2 ) and a bare wall, you can quickly create more space for hanging clothes. All you have to do is turn them upside down and install them vertically and voila: you've got tons of unexpected storage room. (Image credit: Bethany Nauert ) Drawer Units \nSmall storage chests and drawer units are an awesome (and affordable) alternative to bringing heavy dressers and cabinets into a cramped bedroom. If possible, squeeze a wire unit in a tight closet to organize your unmentionables or an open one in an empty corner to show off your purses and shoes in style. (Image credit: Lauren Naimola ) Hanging Hooks \nFunny how something as simple as a hook can be such game changer for your home. Whether you hope to hang up your assortment of hats and purses, or some of your jackets and scarves, coat hooks are cheap way to forge more storage room while maximizing your wall space. (Image credit: Samara Vise ) Trunks + Storage Benches \nFrom storing spare bed sheets and pillows, to books and handbags, there are few things that a good trunk or storage bench can't hold or do. Place one at the end of your bed for extra storage room and let it moonlight as a clever accent table or desktop. (Image credit: Kim Lucian ) Wardrobes \nWhen all else fails, remember that you can always go out and buy your own exterior closet—one that you can take with you when you move. Furnishings such as armoires , wardrobes , and dressers are, of course, designed for extra (and hidden) storage. However, like any other functional piece of furniture, it might require some additional spending money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:37:18.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
