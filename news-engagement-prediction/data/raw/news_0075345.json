The whole desert was knee to waste high with buffel grass. \n\"We thought it would be a good opportunity to show people that you can actually get rid of buffel.\" \nParticipant Alisha Mercer said in this area of work people could often feel alone, and workshops helped bring people together. \n\"People feel like they're doing something, but didn't realise so many other people were thinking like them and acting on their own properties,\" Ms Mercer said. Educating to motivate \nThirty-five people attended the first buffel tour. \nMr Cocking said it was funded through a small community grant from Territory NRM and the national Landcare program. \n\"The next step will be actually getting people out there and doing the buffel management so that we can protect our native flora and fauna,\" he said. \nLong-term local Bruce Simmons has been managing buffel for many years on his own land, but said he still learnt something new. \n\"I learnt a little bit about when seeds are ripe on the buffel grass heads. I wasn't sure about that,\" he said. \nMr Simmons said the buffel was flourishing, but he was able to demonstrate on his block how native grasses and legumes came back once the buffel was gone. \n\"You can beat buffel, if you're persistent and develop a technique which works for you. I like digging it out myself,\" he said. \nMr Cocking said the group planned to hold another workshop next month at the Ilparpa Swamp and Wildlife Reserve in Alice Springs, known to locals as the claypans, an area of vacant crown land just south of town. \n\"Largely because the fire threat at the moment is incredible,\" he said. \n\"It's a national fire threat that we need to be dealing with, not just leaving it up to the pastoralists and park rangers and the firefighters, but actually getting out there ourselves. \n\"We'll be out there protecting areas of fire sensitive species, whipper snipping and getting rid of buffel to protect the trees.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:33:58.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
