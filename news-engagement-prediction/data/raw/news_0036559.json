Aguinaldo and Commissioners Jose A. Fabia and Isabel D. Agito said former local officials of Cebu City, along with the supplier Gampik Construction and Development Inc., should be held liable for P23,968,800. COA-Region 7 only recommended P13.335 million in liabilities. \nThe COA-CP meanwhile affirmed disallowances of P19.98 million for Mandaue City officials and suppliers. The regional office previously set the amount at P11.234 million. \n“This Commission holds that there was a clear violation of RA No. 9184 (the Government Procurement Reform Act) as the project did not undergo the required public bidding. It is apparent that negotiated procurement is not justified under the circumstances,” COA said. \nIt explained that city officials failed to show there was an imminent danger to life or property due to man-made or natural calamities. This would have been the only justification for negotiation of procurement. \nCOA said, “The hosting of the Asean Summit is not a disaster. Since there is no calamity at the time the projects were implemented, there is no danger to speak of.” As the local government contracts for street lighting facilities in Cebu and Mandaue were \"illegal\" in this case, the COA determined the auditors did their duties corrrectly by disallowing the payments made to Gampik. \nWhile the audit leader and the COA regional cluster director issued notices of disallowance for the supposed “overpayments” made to Gampik, the Commission Proper said the correct amount should be based on the actual sum paid to the supplier as partial payment. \nThe COA explained, “Accordingly, the two contracts for the supply and installation of street lighting facilities in Cebu City under Contract ID No. 06HO0007/... and in Mandaue City under Contract ID No. 06HO0008... are disallowed in audit. All the persons held liable are jointly and severally liable.” \nCriminal cases have already been filed at the Sandiganbayan concerning the lamppost procurement deals. The cases named former Cebu and Mandaue City executives, Public Works officials, and private contractors as defendants. – Rappler.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:18:23.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
