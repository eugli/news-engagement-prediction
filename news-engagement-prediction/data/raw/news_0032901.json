Aquarium near Scottsdale celebrated its grand opening Sept. 3, 2016. The 2 million-gallon aquarium is one of the largest in the country. Ben Moffat/azcentral.com \nThe mega aquarium is an educational and entertaining way to spend a few hours. Here's how to make the most out of your visit. Lyla Keane of San Tan Valley visits OdySea Aquarium near Scottsdale on Sept. 7, 2016. (Photo: Michael Chow/The Republic) \n911 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 9 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMy husband and I live five minutes away from the OdySea Aquarium in Scottsdale, and we've now been with our kids three times since it opened in fall 2016. Each of our visits lasted about two hours and were fun, educational experiences for all four members of our family.\nHere are some observations, tips and suggestions on how to make your trip and enjoyable one - and worth the price of admission. Because after all, a visit to OdySea is not an inexpensive outing. Four general admission tickets (for two adults and two children) will set you back almost $135.\n1. Take your time The facility touted Labor Day weekend as its grand opening, but in truth, that first visit felt much more like a soft opening. You know, the kind of thing restaurants and businesses typically do to work out the bugs in their various systems. On Day 2, some exhibits weren't open, one elevator temporarily stopped (according to another family who warned us not to get on it), and it was occasionally hard to tell what animals/fish we were looking at because the tanks weren't marked.\nSubsequent visits, however, indicate that the staff has worked out many of the initial kinks in the system. There is new signage. Tanks are full. And each display is chock full of information. One of my favorites? A color-coded and numbered scale that tells you how endangered each species is and why.\nThe lobby areas are also now filled with new, interactive features that our kids loved (almost as much as the aquarium displays). There are coloring sheets and crayons and tables for the little-people set, movable water art displays for slightly older children, and a giant \"lite bright\" that even adults were enjoying.\nThe aquarium also has a vast repertoire of \"ambassador animals\" that staff make available for human interaction (including American alligators and a ball python), adding the potential for a surprise each visit.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Gorgeous new photos of sea life at OdySea   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Ask the staff I've never seen so many employees (easy to spot in distinctive navy or teal blue OdySea shirts.) They were everywhere. And they were universally nice and eager to help. They gave high-fives to the kids, patiently pointed us in the direction of the bathroom, helped us navigate from one floor to the other. The attitude of the employees we encountered did wonders in making us want to come back and visit again.\n3. Go early - or late The first time we went, my husband and I arrived at OdySea at 8:50 a.m., for a planned 9 a.m. entry, as we took the plunge six months ago and purchased lifetime passes. We snagged a relatively close parking spot and got in line. When we arrived there were about 200 people ahead of us, but everything moved quickly and we were in the lobby and on our way to our first exhibit by 9:10 a.m. Nothing felt overwhelming or overcrowded as we moved through the aquarium.\nBut that ease of entry seemed to break down as the day went on – when we left around 11:15 a.m., the line of folks waiting for general admission entry was easily 500 deep, snaked around the courtyard, and didn't seem to be going anywhere. OdySea utilizes an online or advance purchase ticket entry system, and patrons were grouped accordingly – 11 a.m., 11:15 a.m., 11:30 a.m. But they hadn't yet let the 11 a.m. group in when we walked out.\nWe also noticed that mid-day seemed to be the worst time to go in terms of parking. Parking is free, but the lot is not very big, and that meant cars parked on side streets behind the aquarium, with visitors walking a good distance to get inside. OdySea even suggested on its Facebook page that folks carpool, use Uber or get a ride from a friend. Now I know why. Try to get tickets first thing in the morning or late in the day. Subsequent visits were less chaotic, but parking still seemed to be a challenge by mid-day.\nThe pizza at Lighthouse Cafe at OdySea.   (Photo: Ginger Rough/The Republic) \n4. Set your budget before you go The aquarium has an on-site restaurant, the Lighthouse Cafe, which is well-lit and features plenty of seating. Food offerings are fairly typical, and prices, while not exorbitant, aren't exactly cheap. Kids meals (chicken tenders or a hot dog) are $6 or $8 and come with a side (we chose fruit.) Entrees run about $12 each if you get a meal that includes a side and a beverage. Our total bill for a pepperoni pizza (which easily fed 2), a cheeseburger with fries, a kids hot dog, two sodas, two chocolate milks and an extra fruit cup was $46. One really nice bonus – calorie counts are listed by all menu items.\nSince it opened, the restaurant has also launched a series of \"family meal deals\" where you can order four of an item (cheeseburgers, etc.), with sides and a drink for about $40. But the Odysea in the Desert entertainment complex (the expansive entertainment/shopping development that houses the aquarium) is home to a variety of restaurants, including El Encanto Mexican Cafe, Humble Pie, Opa Life Greek Cafe and Johnny Rockets. So don't get stuck eating inside the aquarium if you don't need to.\nAnd keep in mind, there are plenty of other pitfalls that can potentially lighten your wallet: most notably the aquarium gift shop. It's expansive and features everything from growlers and coffee mugs to shirts, stuffed animals, toys, books and home decor. But it's not cheap. Mama and baby aquarium plush toys are $30 each. The growler will set you back $54, travel coffee mugs run between $15 and $25, and one set of T-shirts we looked at cost $27. If you want to buy a souvenir or lunch, great! But be prepared for the extra hit on your wallet.\nSharks on the carousel viewing exhibit at OdySea.   (Photo: Ginger Rough/The Republic) \n5. Opt out of the carousel if you have very young children OdySea unveiled its mystery exhibit during its grand opening. It's a cool feature – a movie theater-style room with a rotating floor that moves slowly between four exhibits. The seats are comfortable, the exhibit viewing is leisurely, and it's nice to sit down. But if you have toddlers or infants, you might want to forego the attraction. It takes about 20 minutes to move through the marine-life exhibits. My kids, who are a little older, loved most of it – especially the great shark viewing. But families who brought babies and toddlers under the age of about two spent more time shushing fussy infants and occupying unable-to-sit-still-for-that-long toddlers than they did listening to the educational talks. For the adults and older kids, this is a great attraction. It's also the only place to see the rescued turtles and sea lions and it provides the best shark viewing. But if you have little ones, maybe steer them toward the touch pool where they can get hands-on with starfish and other creatures. You can also show them the sharks through windows in the lower-level bathrooms, just off the lobby.\nChildren can get tactile with sea creatures at the touch pool at OdySea.   (Photo: Ginger Rough/The Republic) \n6. Mind the FAQ - and skip the double stroller The aquarium is a big space, but a lot of that space is filled with tanks, which means there are some narrow hallways and sharp turns to navigate. OdySea does not allow double or jogging strollers . So if you've got little ones who can't walk the entire time, bring a couple of the cheap umbrella strollers instead, or, if possible, leave them behind completely. OdySea has standard escalators to move between floors, and they took a long time to arrive.\n7. Be aware of accessibility limitations Jennifer Longdon, of LivAbility magazine, notes that most of the exhibits at OdySea are easily accessible , with staff that are efficient and willing to move large risers aside to accommodate wheelchair users. Two areas, however, did pose problems: the otter enclosure and the stingrays and starfish. Longdon found that most of the otters spend much of their time on land, where they are best viewed through an elevated area that requires patrons to step up to see through the windows. Similarly, Longdon found it was impossible for those unable to lean over the walls to interact and touch the stingrays and starfish. The Living Sea Carousel feature (see above) can accommodate five wheelchair users in each section; the video narrations do not contain closed captions, but guests who cannot hear the narration can ask that a script be made available in advance so they are able to read along while they view the exhibits.\nRELATED: OdySea Aquarium unveils mystery exhibit at grand opening | Watch: Grand opening video | Aquariums around Phoenix | Pros, cons of taking kids to Dolphinaris Arizona \n8. Consider an annual pass If you live in Phoenix and think you'll be repeat guests at the aquarium, consider the annual pass option, which gives you unlimited visits during the course of the year. You can get an annual pass for a family of four (two adults, two children) for $400. That means it will pay for itself if you visit four times in a 12 month period. Plus, you get a 10 percent discount on items at the gift shop and in the cafe. Another benefit: You can skip the timed-ticket entry system: just go when you want to go.\nThus far, the aquarium has not offered any coupons or deals on sites such as LivingSocial or Groupon.\nMORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest \nAZCENTRAL\nThings To Do app: Get the best in events, dining and travel right on your device\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn OdySea Aquarium near Scottsdale   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
