(AP) \nMitchell Santner stepped up to trap Wayne Parnell in front for a duck to leave the visitors stuttering at 214-8 as the hosts closed in on what appeared to be a comfortable victory. \nDwaine Pretorius (50 from 27 balls) and Andile Phehlukwayo (29 not out), who had helped de Villiers through to the four-wicket victory in Hamilton, however, then combined for 61 runs in 7.2 overs to put New Zealand’s nerves on edge. \nSouth Africa fought back well to require 20 runs from the final two overs but some excellent death bowling by Boult (3-63), who ended Pretorius’ resistance, and Tim Southee (1-60) ensured the hosts were able to restrict the visitors to 283-9. \nEarlier, Taylor’s 17th century was perfectly paced, with the 32-year-old hitting his eighth four from the final delivery of the innings from Parnell to reach the milestone. \nThe batsman also became the fourth New Zealander to surpass 6,000 ODI runs when he reached 50. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:15:43.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
