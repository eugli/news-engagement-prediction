Umana succeeds Michael Zuckerman ’17. \n“ImeIme is one of the most brilliant, thoughtful, and dedicated people I’ve ever met, and the Law Review is in phenomenally good hands,” said Zuckerman. “Like many others around campus, I’ve been blown away by ImeIme since she was an undergraduate in Harvard’s Lowell House, and it has been thrilling to watch the Law Review’s membership recognize so heartily what a special human being she is. I am excited for all of the amazing work that she will do for our institution in the year ahead.” \nUmana graduated from Harvard College in 2014 with an A.B. in African American Studies and Government. She is a joint degree candidate with Harvard Law School and Harvard Kennedy School of Government. Last summer, she interned at the Bronx Defenders and will be interning at the Public Defender Service for D.C. this upcoming summer. \n“Mike and his volume have done an exceptional job,” said Umana. “Mike has led the Law Review with formidable intellect, tremendous empathy, and a tireless work ethic. The Law Review community has benefited immensely from his leadership. Though he is a tough act to follow, it is a great privilege to be able to serve and work with the remarkably talented and committed group of editors on the Law Review.” \nThe Law Review, founded in 1887 by future Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis, LL.B. 1887, is an entirely student-edited journal with the largest circulation of any law journal in the world. It is published monthly from November through June.
