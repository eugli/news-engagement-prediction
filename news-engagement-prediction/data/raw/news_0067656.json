Next to the corpse was a plastic bag with his belongings — a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement bag that is typically given to people who are deported. \nDHS' KELLY PROPOSES HIRING MORE IMMIGRATION OFFICERS, FAST-TRACKING DEPORTATIONS \nAs the Trump administration lays out a tougher approach to immigration enforcement, millions of people living in the United States illegally could be targeted for deportation — including people simply arrested for traffic violations. \nUnder a sweeping rewrite of immigration enforcement policies announced Tuesday, any immigrant who is in the country illegally and is charged or convicted of any offense, or even suspected of a crime, will now be an enforcement priority. \nUnder the Obama administration guidance, immigrants whose only violation was being in the country illegally were generally left alone. \nFORCED TO FIGHT ALONE \nThe new enforcement documents are the latest efforts by President Donald Trump to follow through on campaign promises to strictly enforce immigration laws. He's also promised to build a wall at the Mexican border — he insists Mexico will eventually foot the bill — and Kelly's memos reiterate calls for Homeland Security to start planning for the costs and construction. \nThe AP contributed to this report.
