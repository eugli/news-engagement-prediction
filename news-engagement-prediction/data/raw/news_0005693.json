But Karan Johar, whose Ae Dil Hai Mushkil locked horns with Ajay Devgn's Shivaay last Diwali, admits he would never compete with Salman Khan at the box office.\n\nKaran Johar \nAt the trailer launch of his upcoming production, Badrinath Ki Dulhania, Karan confessed he'd never choose Eid for a film release. \"Eid is owned by Salman, and I would never release my film on that festival. Of course, if Salman and I collaborate on a film, I would be happy if it arrived on Eid. Otherwise it is best not to,\" he said.\nKaran's Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt-starrer will hit theatres on Holi. \"We have to strategise our release dates. Our films must hit screens at a time when we can benefit the most. Nowadays, we need to keep an eye on Hollywood releases too,\" he added.\nVarun is ecstatic over the festive release. \"I will gradually move on to Diwali and Eid releases too,\" said the actor, who will fill Salman's shoes in the sequel to Judwaa (1997).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:48:12.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
