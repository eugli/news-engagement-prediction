Story continues below \nThe Safe Third Agreement allows Canadian border officials to refuse entry to individuals who have previously arrived in a safe country where they are able to request refugee protections before having entered Canada. \nUniversity of Manitoba Law Student, Maddie Pearlman, said this all stems from the executive order that President Trump issued on January 27th. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump’s travel ban sparks protests, confusion for green card holders at US airports \n“Our concern with the agreement is if that if refugees have passed through the states and they’re coming to seek protection in Canada, they’ll be sent back, and it’s assumed that they came to the US first and it’s safe,” Pearlman said. \nShe said the concern is about what the potential human rights violations might be. \nThe law students said they hope they can use their own education to learn more about the issues present and also help find fair treatment of refugees. \n“We believe we have a moral obligation to use our legal education to ensure justice for refugees who arrive at Canadian borders seeking asylum,” Pearlman said. \nThe law students in Manitoba joined their professors and fellow students nation-wide in this research-a-thon in hopes of seeking an end to the enforcement of the Safe Third Agreement. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:36:54.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
