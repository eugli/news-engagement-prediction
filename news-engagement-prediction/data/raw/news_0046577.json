It’s just way easier to pick a spot way out at the end of the lot and pull through, you know? Well, researchers at the University of London wanted to quite literally solve the problem of parallel parking, so they devised a formula to work out how much extra space you need to pull of the maneuver. The numbers are pretty complicated, but they did help us outline the mathematically perfect way to parallel park. Here’s the recipe: Pull alongside the car ahead of the spot you want and align your rear tires with that car’s bumper. Turn your wheel toward the curb as far as it will go. Back up until the center of your inside rear tire aligns with the street side edge of that forward car. Straighten the wheel and keep backing up. When your outside tire aligns with that same edge, turn your wheel out toward the street and keep reversing.
