The company will meet with “caregivers and explain our commercialization plans, review their concerns, discuss all options, and move forward with commercialization based on an agreed plan of action,” he said in the statement.\nThe delay was also announced at a Monday meeting in Washington of parents of children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare disease affecting some 12,000 boys in the U.S.\nMarathon received approval last week from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to sell the drug, deflazacort, to patients with Duchenne. The drug hadn’t been available in the U.S. previously, but many patients had been importing it from the U.K. for about $1,200 to $1,600 annually. Some families had raised objections to the new price.\nCatherine Collins, who spoke at Monday’s meeting and whose son, Dylan, 11, has Duchenne, accused Marathon of “predatory pricing. Enough, gross,” she said. Ms. Collins, of New York, says she pays between $800 and $1,000 a year now for deflazacort that she imports from overseas.\nA Marathon spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company said last week it expected to receive far less than its $89,000 list price after paying rebates to Medicaid programs, and providing copay coupons and free medicine to patients with high-deductible insurance or with no insurance at all.\nIn a letter to privately-held Marathon on Monday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I.-Vt.) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D.-Md.) requested detailed information on the company’s “outrageous plan to begin charging $89,000 per year” for the drug, despite the drug having been available for decades in Europe at a fraction of that price.\nThe lawmakers requested information from Marathon including how much it spent to develop the drug, its revenue and profit projections and its communications with health insurers about covering the drug, according to the letter, dated Feb. 13.\nThe FDA approval gives Marathon the exclusive right to sell deflazacort in the U.S. for a period of seven years before competitors can enter the market. The seven-year exclusivity period was granted under the FDA’s program for orphan drugs, which treat diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S.\n“We urge you to significantly lower your price for this drug before it goes on the market next month,” Messrs. Sanders and Cummings wrote in the letter. “Marathon’s apparent abuse of government-granted exclusivity periods and incentives to sell what should be a widely available drug for $89,000 a year is unconscionable.”\nRep. Robert Aderholt (R.-Ala.) also criticized Marathon for its pricing of deflazacort. The company “will have a high hurdle to claim that they are not doing harm in their pricing,” Mr. Aderholt, chair of the House Appropriations subcommittee that funds the FDA, said in statement Monday.\n“It makes me question whether the current construct of how FDA approves orphan drugs does more harm than good if companies have found a way to game the system,” Mr. Aderholt said.\nMarathon, based in Northbrook, Ill., didn’t invent deflazacort. It licensed the rights to clinical trial data from the 1990s that were conducted by another company. That data was the primary basis for the FDA’s approval.\nCongressional investigations into drug pricing have become more common in recent years, though their impact hasn’t always been clear. Marathon received a similar letter from Messrs. Sanders and Cummings in 2014 related to an investigation of sharp price increases on older drugs.\nMarathon later sold the drugs in question, Isuprel and Nitropress, to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., whose own price increases on the drugs became the subject of a letter requesting information by Messrs. Sanders and Cummings in 2015.\nThe Senate Special Committee on Aging also launched an investigation of Valeant and other companies in 2015. The investigation resulted in a 2016 report alleging that the companies had followed a business model of acquiring off-patent drugs “over which they could exercise de facto monopoly pricing power, and then impose and protect astronomical price increases.”\nValeant earlier had pledged to price its products more responsibly following the Congressional scrutiny.\nWrite to Joseph Walker at joseph.walker@wsj.com and Susan Pulliam at susan.pulliam@wsj.com\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://online.wsj.com/"], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:30:36.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
