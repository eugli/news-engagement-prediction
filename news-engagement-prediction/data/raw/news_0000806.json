We are united and this is not us,” Ibrahim said. \nIbrahim immigrated to Canada nearly 20 years ago and said he believes all communities, regardless of religious beliefs, must open up their arms to one another to overcome discrimination and prejudice. \n“We must showcase how strong our community is, how close we are, how welcoming we are, this is our strength,” Ibrahim said. \"It's very sad & shocking.

It’s a sign of solidarity that Zaman said represents the Canada she calls home. \n“I expected no less from our Canadian families, it’s not a surprise to me because that is what Canada is all about,” she said. \n“The majority [of Canadians] are like that, they’re supportive, they’re caring, they’re welcoming.” \n– With files from Steve Silva, Global News © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
