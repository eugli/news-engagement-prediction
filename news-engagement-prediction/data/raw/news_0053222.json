The lady was moving away with her hands towards the bathroom,” Bakar added. “She was very aware that it was toxic and that she needed to wash her hands.” \nWhile Indonesian police had said that one of the suspects had been duped into believing she was pulling a prank for a TV show , Bakar insisted that this wasn’t the case. \nThe women — one Indonesian and one Vietnamese — had been trained to wipe an unknown toxin on his face using just their hands, Bakar said. \nHe added that a North Korean allegedly placed the poison on their hands before the killing occurred and told them to wash them afterwards.
