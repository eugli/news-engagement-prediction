It comes days after Iceland's President Gudni Thorlacius Johannesson suggested that using pineapple as a topping should be outright banned during a visit to a high school in northern Iceland. Many said the topping of pea and mayonnaise was very 'white' while pineapple pizza haters said this unusual pairing was even worse than having the tropical fruit as a topping He was initially met with praise online from those opposed to the pairing, with some even hailing him a hero. However, the backlash from pineapple fans was so fierce that the president was forced to make a public statement on the issue afterwards. He said: 'I like pineapples, just not on pizza. I do not have the power to make laws which forbid people to put pineapples on their pizza... For pizzas, I recommend seafood.' Air-ic took the abuse he received online in good humour, picking out his favourite comments - though he did ponder deleting his account because of the high number of mentions he's received It is unclear at which restaurant Air-ic ate his pea and mayonnaise pizza. The topping is not one that is often on menus at pizzerias - which is perhaps why it evoked such a strong backlash online. Air-ic seems to be taking his newfound fame in good humour though, laughing along with some of the wittier roasts he has received online. He joked that he may have to 'delete my Twitter' after revealing that 300,000 people had engaged with his tweet.
