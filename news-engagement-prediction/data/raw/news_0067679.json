(Supplied: Ken Drake) \n\"Also seeing the connection people have with their pets is a beautiful thing. \n\"It can be an emotional time when owners receive their photos because they have a slice of their pet that's captured forever ... that's a very special moment.\" \nMr Drake works with the RSPCA regularly and shoots its calendar each year. \nHe also recently published a book, Paw Traits, with a portion of the sales going to the charity. \n\"It was so exciting to see my images in a book; all the owners were so excited to have their pets on a page. \n\"This is why I do what I do, it's my calling and I don't imagine there will ever be a time in my life I won't be photographing animals. \n\"It's something I'll do right up until the day I die.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:37:32.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
