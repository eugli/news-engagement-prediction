Raymond B. Gates, right, allegedly forced himself on the 17-year-old victim. Source: Supplied \nThe rape of her 17-year-old friend, which occurred last February, was allegedly filmed while using the social media app Periscope. According to the app’s website, the tool “lets you explore the world through the eyes of somebody else.”\nMs Lonina and her friend allegedly met Raymond B. Gates while they were out shopping. The following day, they went to his apartment where, according to a prosecutor, they “drank alcohol until the victim was heavily intoxicated”.\nMarina Lonina, left was sentenced to nine months prison. While 29-year-old rape suspect Raymond Gates, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nine years in prison last October. Source: Supplied \nIt’s alleged Mr Gates, 29, then forced himself on the victim, while Ms Lonina filmed through the app.\nThe victim, who is now 18-years-old, read a victim impact statement saying she has since suffered from panic attacks.\n“I was too gullible to see how manipulative she truly is,” the victim said of Ms Lonina.\nPleading guilty to obstructing justice, Ms Lonina admitted that she failed to report the rape to police, or turn over any evidence following the incident.\nPeriscope was used by Marina Lonina to live stream her friend’s rape. Source: Supplied \nMr Gates, who plead guilty, was sentenced to nine years behind bars for the rape.\nWhen Ms Lonina was first arrested last year, the case was thrown into question as to weather she deserved the same punishment as Mr Gates — despite having no physical involvement.\nDuring the initial hearing, Ms Lonina’s defence lawyer said she “got caught up in the likes” the video was receiving, and would often film everything using the app.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:39:59.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
