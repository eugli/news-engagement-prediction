Some raised fists in solidarity and others raised middle fingers, while demonstrators reveled in the attention. \n\"I feel like we have a lot of eyes on us because of the Super Bowl,\" said Melanie Villela, who last Saturday created the most widely shared Facebook event page for the protest. \"It was too good of an opportunity to pass up.\" \nRozella White, another organizer, described the gathering as a coalescence of left-leaning groups that have gained mass in recent years, including Black Lives Matter, environmentalists, feminists and advocates of rights for immigrants, indigenous and LGBT people. She and others handed out a list of 13 local organizations that she said collaborated in assembling the march.

Saturday's protest follows two days of similar gatherings in Houston last weekend in response to a steady volley of White House executive orders. \nThe march began in close coordination with Houston police. One officer addressed the crowd as it grew, asking those gathered to \"take care of members who get too emotional.\" \n\"You lose the message when you get too emotional,\" the officer told the crowd. \nAlthough the event started off orderly and calm, by the time the mass neared Super Bowl crowds, dozens of officers worked to keep the protesters corralled and maintain free passage on sidewalks for the Super Bowl fans.

Trump is the president,\" Klenk said. \"Move on. Right now they're disrupting America.\" \nSaturday's action was just the latest in a busy week of protests, which has also included actions at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport, near the Galleria and at the Mexican consulate. For Sunday's big game, crowds are slated to gather at Hermann Park around noon before marching toward NRG Stadium where the Super Bowl will be played.
