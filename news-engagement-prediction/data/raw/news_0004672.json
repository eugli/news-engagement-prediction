Without the cap, she would have faced a possible sentencing range of three to 14 years in prison, or probation if the judge found that the case included extraordinary circumstances. \nDefense attorney John Radosevich argued strongly that extraordinary circumstances did exist in the case because Auld, facing mental health and serious addiction issues through much of her life, had reached a point over the past year in which she discovered her road to recovery and genuinely wanted to pursue it. \n\"You have right now a moment in which an addict is in full acceptance of her addiction,\" he said. \"She's not going to get treatment if you send her to prison.\" \nIn her statement to the court, Auld said she and her friends had been drinking and partying not only that night but \"every night,\" and that drinking and driving did not seem unusual for her. \n\"We were all very intoxicated,\" she said. \"At the time, I would consider myself one of the best drunk drivers.\" \nShe said she was driving a friend's Volkswagen Beetle from a bar in Fox Lake to a hotel when the crash occurred. \nAuld said she and \"Stevie\"\"had the music all the way up\" and \"considered ourselves unstoppable.\" \nShe said in retrospect she believes her drinking and drug use was always to cover up pain rather than for pleasure. \nAuld's grandfather testified at the sentencing hearing that she had a child at 13 and dropped out of Mundelein High School in part due to teasing. She received a GED degree at College of Lake County, but had substance abuse and mental health problems stemming from family issues. He added that the issues included never having known who her father was and a mother with depression and other matters that left her unable to give Auld the care she needed. \nBut in a victim-impact statement at the hearing, Merissa Daskaukas said her brother, Steven, was dead because of a conscious choice made by Auld. \n\"What can I say? My brother's life, at 22, was taken from him by the action of someone else,\" she said, crying. \"I understand it was an accident, but it was an accident that resulted from choice.\" \nMerissa said her brother was loving and kind and \"simply the most beautiful soul.\" \nOfficials said Auld will serve the term at 85 percent and receive credit for 347 days spent in Lake County Jail. Radosevich said based on those factors, he expects that under the sentence Auld received Tuesday afternoon, she will spend roughly five-and-a-half years in prison. \nAuld was not charged until almost a year after the crash, and was held in Lake County Jail on $500,000 bail since that time. \nTwitter @jimnewton5", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:45:00.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
