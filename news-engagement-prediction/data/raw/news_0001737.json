Charlie Baker is really upping his wager on the Patriots winning Sunday. \nIn addition to ‚Äúlucky‚Äù Boston cream pie cupcakes from a Springfield bakery and Legal Seafood‚Äôs clam chowder ‚Äî which proved successful in Baker‚Äôs previous playoff bets with the governors of Texas and Pennsylvania , respectively ‚Äî the Massachusetts governor is putting local cider doughnuts on the line in a Super Bowl bet with Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal. \n‚ÄúNo offense to @bcfootball icon Matty Ice, but I‚Äôve got @SmolakFarms cider doughnuts on the [goat emoji] Tom Brady,‚Äù Baker tweeted Wednesday at his peer in the Peach State. Advertisement \nAs if Deal needed another reason to root for his home state‚Äôs Atlanta Falcons, the North Andover orchard recently placed fourth in a Boston.com reader survey of Massachusetts‚Äôs best cider doughnuts. \nIn return, Deal bet Baker local Brunswick stew ‚Äî an apparently popular tomato-based Southern stew containing various beans, vegetables, and meats ‚Äî and chocolate-covered blueberries (it turns out that the state of Georgia is the fourth-largest commercial blueberry producer in the country, according to the U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council , a blueberry industry interest group). \nDeal later tacked on an apple pie from an orchard in Northern Georgia, which prompted Baker to raise him with Smolak Farms‚Äô cider doughnuts. \nFrom elected officials to local businesses , friendly intra-state wagers have been en vogue during the Patriots‚Äô playoff run. And if Brady and company win Sunday, Baker could have a formidable feast on his hands. In addition to the potential winnings of Brunswick stew, chocolate-covered blueberries, and apples pie, the Bay State governor has already won Primanti Brothers sandwiches, a torte , and Texas barbecue in the Patriots‚Äô wins over the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans. \nAnd with the teams‚Äô recent dominance, no wonder Baker keeps initiating these bets.
