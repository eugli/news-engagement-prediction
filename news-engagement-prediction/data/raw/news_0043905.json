He can make plays for others. He can defend. He’s got good size. And he works hard. One thing I do know about him is he’s a hard worker and at the beginning of his career he wasn’t really given anything. He didn’t have the opportunity to play — we kind of have the same situation where we didn’t play as much. And then when we were given our opportunity, we took it and ran with it.’’\nThomas also said that he could see how he and Butler’s games would complement each other if they did join forces.\n“For sure,’’ Thomas said. “We have some of the same similarities. We work hard, we don’t back down from anybody, and we would never give them anything.’’\nButler going to Boston would undoubtedly at least make the Celtics a bigger threat to dethroning the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference, but a threat and actually pulling it off are two very different things.\nWhat can’t be overlooked, however, is where the Bulls’ currently stand.\nAt 28-29, they will start the final push for a playoff spot in the No. 7 spot with 25 regular-season games left, and close out the month of April with that schedule working in their favor.\nThe last five games for the Bulls include at New York, at Philadelphia, at Brooklyn, home to Orlando and then home to Brooklyn in the regular-season finale. It couldn’t set up any better.\nPlayoffs matter to this front office, evident by how they often point out all the playoff appearances they’ve made in the last decade, despite only reaching the Eastern Conference Finals just once.\nMoving Butler would make the playoffs a much tougher road to reach, while also assuring that Dwyane Wade would exit stage left this offseason. Basically, the two best recruiters for free agents that the Bulls have.\nThat doesn’t mean the Bulls will be silent come Thursday, either.\nWhile Butler is the most attractive piece to move and one that has by far the biggest return, Taj Gibson, Nikola Mirotic and Rajon Rondo are each possibilities to be elsewhere. Both Gibson and Mirotic are hitting the free agent market this summer, while Rondo hasn’t been happy with his back-up role since the beginning of January.\n ", "external_links": ["https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/butler21.jpg?w=1340", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/butler21.jpg?w=670&#038;h=377", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/butler21.jpg", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/butler21.jpg?w=150", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/butler21.jpg?w=1024", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/butler21.jpg?w=533", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/butler21.jpg?w=768"], "published": "2017-02-20T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:43:51.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
