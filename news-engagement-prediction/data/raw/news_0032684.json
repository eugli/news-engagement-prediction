Ilitch was the guy who made breakfast and shoveled the walk.\nThey were good together. Better together.\nMike Ilitch died Friday. He was 87. Born on Detroit’s west side in 1929, he is survived by his family, along with generations of Detroit sports fans. He’d owned the NHL’s Red Wings since 1982 and Major League Baseball’s Tigers since 1992, won four Stanley Cup championships and went to two World Series. He won neither of those , but never stopped trying, only last winter telling the Detroit Free Press after signing another free agent, “It might sound silly, but I don’t care about spending money.”\nHe was the minor-league shortstop who’d turned a day job washing used cars into a pizza empire, who grew rich and stayed, who stayed and tried to make the place more livable, who put winning teams in new buildings, and so perhaps brought a little pride into another place that could use it.\nThey called him Mr. I. And while it could be mildly uncomfortable when Tigers players and managers spoke of winning one for Mr. I before, you know, the sentiment came from a good place. What was good for Mr. I seemed good for Detroit. The reverse, too.\nTigers and Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch (center) died Friday at the age of 87. (Getty Images) More At a time when team owners are viewed at best suspiciously, Mr. I would sign that catcher, would sign that slugger, would pay his best players to stay, even if a high-end payroll in a town such as Detroit made little business sense. Even if it did, it wasn’t necessary, but Mr. I loved the game like they did — like the players and the fans did — and that went a long way in places like Anchor Bar and Hockeytown Café, along with Comerica Park and Joe Louis Arena. His pursuit of championships, his loyalty to the city and therefore to them, bore their loyalty to him.\n“I’m crushed right now,” former Tigers manager Jim Leyland told the Free Press on Friday night. “He did so much for me. … That’s the one thing we were always broken-hearted about, that we didn’t get that World Series for him.”\nThe love affair would play in any town, probably, but it seemed more fitting in Detroit. The Tigers could be great or they could be terrible, and then Mike Ilitch would stand in and without a gripe take another shot.\nTo the eye of an outsider, he was good that way. He was a decent man who also cared about winning ballgames. He saw what that might do for a place, for the spirit of a place, especially one that hadn’t all the usual advantages, and he seemed to decide that that’s what you take with you.\nHe tried. He won some. He lost too. It was dignified and it was honest. And so they were better for each other.\nAs for which was holding up the other all these years?\nThey took turns, probably.\nMore on Yahoo Sports:\n• Knicks’ major problem?
