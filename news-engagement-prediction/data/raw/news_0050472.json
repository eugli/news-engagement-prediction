He set the victim on fire after cutting pieces of mattress and using kerosene oil. The act of the convict was brutal and diabolic,\" said the court.It added: \"Keeping in view facts and circumstances of the case, I sentence the convict to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life or death.\"The court also imposed a fine of Rs18,000 on him considering his poor background.Safi, a resident of Madhubani in Bihar, was the victim's servant.
