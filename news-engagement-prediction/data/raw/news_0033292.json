By Tara Palmeri 02/12/17 07:01 AM EST \nKellyanne Conway is seen within the White House as a “Queen without an Army,” according to a former campaign official. | Getty Print \nKellyanne Conway once again put herself at the center of controversy this week when she went on national television and declared she was doing a “free commercial” for Ivanka Trump’s clothing line, ethics laws be damned. Media snarked, ethics watchdogs barked and even White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Conway had been “counseled” on her behavior. \nBut according to someone who has worked with Conway and knows her thinking intimately,none of that much matters to Conway. She’s taking a long view in her bid to rise in the White House ranks — and she’s performing for an audience of one: President Donald Trump. Story Continued Below \nAnd so while critics may squawk, what matters most to Conway is that Trump sees her defending him on national television. \nFor Conway, the prize for loyalty is eventually landing a spot as chief of staff, becoming the first woman ever to hold the role and cementing her spot at the center of Trump’s inner circle. \nCurrently, Conway is seen within the White House as a “Queen without an Army,” according to a former campaign official. Conway has a vague title of “counselor,” and recently hired a chief of staff and an assistant to support her on her quest to dig into the \"next phase of issues,\" according to Conway. She has taken ownership of opioid-abuse and veterans affairs, a portfolio that Trump cares deeply about. Conway says she plans to turn her office into a war room, and was quick to mention that she has top-security clearance. \nShe has her eye on leading the White House Council on Women and Girls with former Goldman Sachs executive Dina Powell, senior counselor for economic initiatives, and with Ivanka Trump, should Ivanka decide to take a more active role in the administration. \nWhite House officials say Conway spends her days dipping in and out of meetings to offer big-picture communications advice, while taking on cable news talking heads in the mornings and evenings and steering reporters throughout the day. \nHad she wanted it, Conway could have a more defined role already. Trump favored Conway for press secretary over Sean Spicer, the long-time aide to Reince Priebus who currently holds the position. But Conway says she turned down the job because she wanted a role in setting policy, not just communicating it. By Natasha Korecki \nHad Conway wanted more, and as she sees it, she already has it: “All you need to know is that I have the ear and confidence of one person,” Conway said. \n\"I have ‘walk-in’ privileges,” she said, claiming she’s among the few who can enter the Oval Office without being summoned. \nConway in January even tweeted a line suggesting that she’s filling the shoes of Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to former President Barack Obama: “Congratulations to @VALERIEJARRETT on post-White House life! I inherited your office & love of the job. All BEST.\" \nHoping to cement that role, Conway has never wavered in her defense of Trump since becoming his final campaign manager this summer. She took that defense to a new level Wednesday when, with the president under fire for publicly rebuking Nordstrom over dropping Ivanka Trump’s clothing line, Conway swept in for a dramatic display of loyalty. In a nationally televised interview, Conway touted the president’s right to defend his daughter and then proclaimed she was doing a “commercial” for the first daughter’s clothing line — federal rules preventing public officials from using their office to plug private products be damned. \nIt’s what Conway has done for Trump all along, allow him to spit fire for his base and then defend him against everyone else. \nThat’s important to an image-obsessed Trump, who continually assesses what his team is doing to promote him on television. \n“She’s the one who is more in tuned with what’s going on in the world of the media, and what they’re thinking which is valuable for Trump, because his entire day fluctuates based on what’s in the media,” the former campaign official said. \nTrump relies on her to create what Conway calls “real people impact.” \nTo Conway, that means communicating in the way that Trump did on the campaign trail, tapping into \"the forgotten man and woman.\" It also means talking about how things will look, like if Trump should sign an executive order in the Oval Office or somewhere in middle America. \n\"I promised the president I would help oversee communications here,” Conway said. “Comms is not press, it’s visionary, it’s the real people impact.” \nAccording to a source close to Trump, the real estate magnate respects the aides that he perceives don’t need him, like Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, a multi-millionaire who ran right-wing news outlet Breitbart. And he measures his team as either staff or peers based on their success, which may explain why Conway is quick to explain that Trump knows the sacrifice she has made to work for him. \n“He knows I had huge offer to sell my firm. He knows I walked away from millions,” Conway said. “I admire the sacrifices he made to be here and he admires the sacrifices I made. Having to sort through the schooling and living situation for my family. It means something to me that he acknowledges it.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T14:12:56.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
