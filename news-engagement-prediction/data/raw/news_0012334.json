It just wasn't the one many expected. \nDallas quarterback Dak Prescott won the award over teammate Ezekiel Elliott. \n\"Can I cut this thing in half?\" Prescott said at the NFL Honors awards show in Houston as Elliott joined him on the stage at Houston's Wortham Theater Center. Prescott was also voted by fans as the Pepsi Rookie of the Year. \nMORE: PFWA picks Elliott as top offensive rookie \nPrescott threw for 3,667 yards with 23 touchdowns and four interceptions while helping the Cowboys go 13-3 to win the NFC East and secure the top seed in the NFC playoffs. His passer rating of 104.9 was third in the NFL, behind only Super Bowl quarterbacks Matt Ryan and Tom Brady. \nElliott led the NFL with 1,631 rushing yards and had 15 touchdowns. While he didn't win rookie of the year, Elliott was selected as a Pro Bowler in his first NFL season. He was also the Pro Football Writers Association Rookie of the Year and named the FedEx Ground Player of the Year on Saturday. \nChargers defensive end Joey Bosa received Defensive Rookie of the Year honors. Bosa, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft, led all NFL rookies with 10 1/2 sacks in only 12 games. Making his NFL debut in a Week 5 loss to the Raiders, Bosa became just the fifth rookie in NFL history to post two sacks in his first game. \nElliott, the fourth overall pick in last year's draft, became the fifth rookie since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 to lead the NFL in rushing, joining Earl Campbell (1978), George Rogers (1981), Eric Dickerson (1983) and Edgerrin James (1999).
