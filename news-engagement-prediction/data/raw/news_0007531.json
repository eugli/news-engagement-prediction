Mike Ashley has often had a frosty relationship with Newcastle managers \nT ensions have been inflamed behind the scenes, where there is a power struggle taking place between Benitez and others loyal to Ashley, by the fact Benitez understood he would be allowed to reinvest the £30m the club received from Tottenham Hotspur for Moussa Sissoko. \nBenitez was told by Ashley, when he met the owner at the end of last season, that he had a £30m transfer budget. Although he spent all that money, he ended the summer making a huge profit because of the Sissoko deal. \nAs a result, the 56-year-old was mystified to learn there was no money to spend, but tried to make the best of it by setting up a loan deal for Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend , with a clause which guaranteed it would become a permanent switch if Newcastle won promotion. \nPalace wanted a loan fee of between £2-3m and another £12m in the summer, but Newcastle refused to sanction the deal. It is understood Ashley was reluctant to spend £14-15m on a player they sold to Palace in July for just £12m, when the England international had failed to impress at Selhurst Park and would be cheaper to buy in six months. Benitez expected to bring in Andros Townsend in January \nB enitez was confident the Townsend deal would go through on deadline day and feels badly let down. \nIn his opinion, it was worth paying the extra money because it would have significantly strengthened his squad with a Premier League quality player and filled the vacancy left by Sissoko’s late departure in August. \nThat would have made promotion far easier to achieve and although Benitez still believes Newcastle are good enough to go up, he feels it has been made harder than it should. \nAshley’s view is difficult to assess, although sources have suggested to Telegraph Sport that he feels Benitez has already had enough money to get the team back into the top flight. \nThe billionaire had to inject £33m into the club in the form if interest free loans following relegation to cover the cost of keeping a squad on Premier League wages. It may be that the Sissoko money – which is likely to be paid in instalments by Spurs – was also needed to balance the books. \nTelegraph Sport also understands that there has been some criticism of Benitez’s record in the transfer market by those who still have the ear of Ashley and even a suggestion the Magpies have under-performed in the Championship, given the resources at their disposal. Quickest players to 100 Premier League goals \nT hat will incense supporters, who have fallen in love with Benitez and remain fiercely behind the manager, despite a mid-season wobble, which has seen them lose top spot in the division to Brighton. \nAshley, though, has fallen out with other popular managers on Tyneside, most notably Kevin Keegan, who quit because of board interference in recruitment. It is that belligerent and harmful track record that fuels fear he will also refuse to listen to Benitez. \nBenitez has coped with difficult owners before and wants to stay to oversee a long-term project. However, he was only attracted to Newcastle because he feels it has the potential to eventually challenge for a top six place and silverware. \nHe will not want to continue if he feels the only ambition at boardroom level, as was the case before he arrived, is to remain in the Premier League. \nAs a result, he will seek clarification from Ashley at the end of the season about his role and the extent of his power to improve the team. It is likely to be a tense showdown. Follow Telegraph Football", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:38:33.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
