Its venom attacks the nervous system, causing foaming at the mouth, muscle spasms and potentially death. \nThe spider was caught and taken to the Australian Reptile Park where it will be milked as part of a programme to develop anti-venom. \nThe 10-year-old was \"as lucky as they get\", park general manager Tim Faulkner told The Telegraph. \nAustralia is home to a startling number of the world's deadliest creatures, including snakes, spiders, jellyfish and octopuses. \nThe funnel-web spider is particularly feared but no deaths have been recorded since an anti-venom was developed in the 1980s. - AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:19:46.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
