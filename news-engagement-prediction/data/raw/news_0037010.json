Demonetisation has only affected those who have amassed black money. Priyanka Gandhi comes once in a while during election periods and makes statements without even studying what really happened in the past. She is making comments unaware of the political developments, which I think is best to ignore,” BJP leader S. Prakash told ANI here. \nThe Congress star campaigner finally hit the campaign trail for Uttar Pradesh Assembly election addressing a rally at her mother Sonia Gandhi's Lok Sabha constituency Raebareli along with her brother Rahul. \n“UP doesn’t need a leader from outside. All youth of the state can lead UP, build a new UP.” Priyanka said. Commenting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promises to women of the state, she added, “I am a woman…Who has committed the most number of atrocities against women, poor. Wasn’t making you stand in queues atrocities against women?” \nPriyanka also asserted that U.P. did not require an “outsider” to develop it, and conveyed to the Prime Minister that relationships were not built by just talk but they need fulfilling of promises as well. \nPriyanka attended the rally two-day days after BJP leader and Union Minister Smriti Irani claimed the Congress leader was not campaigning as she had no answers to people’s question in Uttar Pradesh.
