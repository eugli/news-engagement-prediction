And in that real world – it is a bit early for a political speech, I am sorry – it is getting darker, as we know. \n“And in the struggle that's coming between the rich and the powerful, the wealthy and the privileged, and the big corporations and the politicians who speak for them, on the one hand, and the rest of us on the other, then filmmakers – and we are all filmmakers here – the filmmakers know which side they are on, and despite the glitz and the glamour of occasions like this, we are with the people. \nHe concluded: “Thanks for this.” \nLoach’s comments were among the fieriest in a surprisingly non-political evening, with most stars choosing not to address recent current affairs (as many had in other recent awards ceremonies) and instead talk more generally about the “divisive” times we live in. \nStill, it could be that the US stars were keeping their powder dry for the Oscars in two weeks time, where they also won’t have to worry about the broadcaster maintaining impartiality (as was the BBC’s dilemma). For now, we’ll just have to wait and see.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:45:35.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
