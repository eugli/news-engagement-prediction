McLean . “Hopefully we can do a lot more with these guys.” \nWorking with the Boys on the single and music video is a childhood dream come true for Kelley — who revealed that his first concert ever was one of theirs. \n“Sixth grade House of Blues Orlando, Florida was my first concert ever — it was the Backstreet Boys,” Kelley told PEOPLE last week. “I got to go with a friend for my best buddy’s younger sister’s birthday. We got to somehow ride in a limo out to Orlando and got to see the Backstreet Boys play a little show. It was crazy. It was awesome, totally inspiring, and to see it come full circle really reminds us to keep dreaming, to dream big, to put out positive energy into the universe, shine your light, and try as hard as you can at whatever you’re great at and great things will happen.” \nHe continued: “That’s what we were reminded of when making this album — whatever success may come, you just keep dreaming and stay true to who you are, and go back to the well for more inspiring. I think choosing the Backstreet Boys was a very natural decision. They were Tyler’s first CD back in the day and they were everywhere.” \nKelley and Hubbard are currently gearing up for the 52 nd Academy of Country Music Awards with five nominations. \nLuke Bryan and Dierks Bentley will return for the second consecutive year to host the 52 nd Academy of Country Music Awards Sunday, April 2 live from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas and airing on the CBS Television Network 8:00 p.m. ET/PT.
