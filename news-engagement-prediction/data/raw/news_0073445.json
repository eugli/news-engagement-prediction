Man Utd vs So'ton Get Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \n\"This is something I have been doing every year, and this is nothing new for me,\" Ibrahimovic said after the recent victory over Leicester. \"I keep producing. I have 20 and seven assists, so the statistics so far are the same region as other years except for last year because that was a crazy year.\" Zlatan's trophy haul 2 x league titles, 1 x Dutch Cup, 1 x Dutch Supercup Juventus 2 x league titles (both later stripped due to Calciopoli scandal) Inter Milan 3 x league titles, 2 x Italian Supercups Barcelona 1 x league title, 1 x Spanish Supercup, 1 x UEFA Supercup, 1 x World Club Cup AC Milan 1 x league title, 1 x Italian Supercup Paris Saint-Germain 4 x league titles, 2 x French Cups, 3 x French League Cups, 3 x French Supercups Manchester United 1 x Community Shield \nThe next obstacle to conquer comes in the form of Southampton at Wembley in Sunday's EFL Cup final, live on Sky Sports , but winning trophies is anything but a new phenomenon for Ibrahmovic. \nIn every season since 2001, Ibrahimovic has picked up at least one winner's medal. His header against Leicester in the Community Shield back in August secured him a first trophy in England, taking his career total to a colossal 30. Ibrahimovic has made light work of Premier League defences \nIbrahimovic has racked up 13 league titles in 15 seasons since leaving his native Sweden for Eredivisie giants Ajax. He's also won a Dutch Cup, two French Cups, three French League Cups, a Dutch Super Cup, the Spanish Super Cup twice, the Italian and French Super Cups three times each and even a European Super Cup and a World Club Cup during his time at Barcelona. \nIbrahimovic's trophy-laden career began with a Dutch league and cup double with Ajax in 2000/01. From there he moved to Italy where he won Serie A titles in both his seasons at Juventus, although they were both ultimately stripped from the club due to their involvement in the Calciopoli match fixing scandal. Ibrahimovic picked up four medals at Barcelona \nAfter Juventus' relegation to Serie B, Ibrahimovic was one of several high-profile departures, but he stayed in Italy with Inter Milan, where he played a key role in three successive Scudetto triumphs for the Nerazzurri before heading to Spain. \nOften regarded as a career low point, having failed to really live up to the billing at Barcelona, Ibrahimovic still amassed an incredible four trophies in just one season in Catalonia, before heading back to Italy to continue collecting silverware. Zlatan Ibrahimovic insists he is out to prove those who said he couldnâ€™t make an impact in the Premier League wrong. \nParis Saint-Germain won the Ligue 1 crown in each of the Swede's four years in the French capital and now his career in England has begun in the manner to which he is accustomed - with a trophy. \nFinals are all in a day's work for Ibrahimovic, and in the form he is in, expect the serial trophy winner to have a big say at Wembley on Sunday.
