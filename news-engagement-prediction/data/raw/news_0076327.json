This is based on the discovery by one of Lowyat.NET Forum’s member. \nAccording to the Kimchi17, the phone is called Maxis NeXT and was discovered through the telco’s official website. The user has also shared a number of screenshot that showed how Maxis logo is visibly shown on the lower part of the phone’s back cover although the user didn’t capture the phone’s spec sheet. \nMeanwhile, the phone’s section on the website has since been deleted but fortunately, Google still keep a cache of the site as it appears on 24 February . The cache doesn’t contain any images that were shared by the forum user and showed that the product site is still far from complete. \nNevertheless, there are still several details that the cache has preserved. One of them stated that the phone might be launched on 3 March 2017 and can be obtained through Maxis Online Store. Additionally, the phone does come with 24-month contract which signify that it might be tied to a plan. One Year On: A Commentary of the Malaysian Telco Space in 2016 \nWe are now working to reach out to Maxis for its comments on this smartphone but since the phone will be launched very soon, we might have to wait for the official announcement to be made by the telco instead in order to know more about Maxis NeXT. \n( UPDATE – 7:22PM : Maxis in its reply to our inquiry didn’t confirm nor deny the existence of the phone but did mentioned that it “will be announcing something very soon,”. So, stay tuned. ) \n[Source: Lowyat.NET Forums .
