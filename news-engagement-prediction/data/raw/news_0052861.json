Yes, the former Auburn head coach is exploring a run for governor in the state of Alabama in 2018, the coach confirmed to AuburnUndercover. CBS Sports reported Tuesday that Tuberville is exploring a run and his camp is conducting a poll of 50,000 people to see whether a run for governor would be a smart move for the former college football coach. \"I’ve been flattered people have come to me and ask me to think about it and that’s what I’m going to do for a few weeks, and I’ve got several things going — television, radio and I might stay in athletics,\" said Tuberville, who writes a column for Auburn Undercover. \"Right now I’m just kinda looking to see what fits me the best.\" Tuberville moved to his home at Lake Martin following his resignation at Cincinnati in December. He has been seen at Auburn basketball games and other events throughout the winter. He has several irons in the fire, and politics is something he wants to explore. He declined to go into specifics concerning his stance on certain issues, but his exploratory committee has certainly made waves. \"Let’s test the wind and see what people think and then we’ll make a decision some time in April,\" Tuberville said. The question is whether Tuberville could win an election as a former Auburn head coach in a state split by the Iron Bowl rivalry. Would Alabama fans vote for the man who defeated the Tide six straight times? “I think Tommy would stand a slugger’s chance of getting elected,” Steve French, a former political consultant in Alabama, told CBSSports.com . “Everybody wants non-politicians now,” said a person from his camp, according to 247Sports. “Eighty-percent of it is name recognition.” Editor's note: Tuberville pens a weekly column for AuburnUndercover as part of the 247Sports network.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:31:04.542+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
