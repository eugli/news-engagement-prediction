Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com \nJUPITER, Fla. • One of the leading candidates for National League Rookie of the Year had the start of his spring training delayed — and perhaps interrupted entirely — by soreness in his elbow that has alarmed the team. \nReyes, a righthander, was sent for a magnetic resonance imaging scan of his right elbow Tuesday afternoon. \nThe results of the scan are not yet known. \n\"There's reason for concern,\" general manager John Mozeliak said. \"If you’re going to boil it down any time you’re taking someone to go get an MRI, it’s not great news. We’ll just wait and see and react accordingly.\" \nThe Cardinals opened spring training Tuesday morning with the first official workout for pitchers and catchers. Reyes, who is competing for the fifth spot in the rotation, was scheduled to throw in the first group, alongside rotation leader Adam Wainwright. \nReyes did not take the mound, and when the media asked about his absence, the team said that he was not yet medically cleared to participate. \n\"I don’t like MRIs. I would rather he wasn’t getting that right now,\" manager Mike Matheny said. \"There was must be a significant reason to do it.\" \nA morning physical had extended into the workout and eventually led to Reyes leaving campus for further examination. Non-roster invite Kendry Flores also went to have an MRI; the righthander experienced soreness in his shoulder. \nMozeliak said Reyes had experienced discomfort in the elbow Friday and alerted the team before Tuesday's physical that there was a possible issue. The team did not know if that would slow his preparation this spring, but coaches did have him on the schedule to throw. Reyes has been selected for the World Baseball Classic, and the Cardinals have the right to hold him back from the tournament if they fear he could cause more harm to an injury or potential injury. \nReyes had a strain in his right elbow in 2013, and he received a platelet-rich injection to aid healing. In 2015, he was also shut down and missed the Futures Game because of inflammation in his right shoulder. \nThe Cardinals had positioned Reyes as a contender for the fifth spot in the rotation. Michael Wacha is the challenger, and Mozeliak stressed that Luke Weaver, who had cameos in the majors last season, should not be discounted. Regardless of where Reyes started the season -- what level or what role -- the Cardinals enter the year expected the flame-throwing righthanded to make an impact on the 2017 season. \nThe scan of Reyes' elbow will be read by doctors as early as Tuesday night if the exam doesn't have any complications. The team intends to gather its medical staff and front office Wednesday morning to review the diagnosis, determine treatment, and consider if a second opinion is necessary. \n\"Let's wait for tomorrow and react then,\" Mozeliak said. \"We're obviously hoping for the best.
