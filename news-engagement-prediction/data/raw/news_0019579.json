Now 13, he's come a long way since teaching himself how to play jazz growing up in Indonesia. “ I hope that they will feel the joy because this music is so joyful and it touches peoples hearts.” \nLast year, Alexander made waves when his debut album, \"My Favorite Things,\" garnered two Grammy nominations for \"Best Jazz Instrumental Album\" and \"Best Jazz Improvised Solo\" at the age of 12, making him the youngest jazz artist to be nominated for a Grammy, according to his record label, Motema Music. \n\"He's the youngest jazz artist for that to ever happen to,\" Jason Olaine, a Grammy Award-winning producer who also produced both of Alexander's albums, told NBC News. \nIn 2016, Alexander also performed with his trio at the pre-telecast ceremony and played solo on the Grammy Awards broadcast. \"For a jazz artist to get any kind of TV time on the Grammys is a rarity,\" Olaine said. \nEven though Alexander didn't take home a Grammy last year, he was thrilled just to be nominated. \"I was very surprised, but also very thankful for all this,\" Alexander told NBC News. \"I still could not believe I had two nominations.\" \nThis year, Alexander received his third Grammy nomination for \"Best Improvised Jazz Solo\" for \"Countdown,\" a tune by the legendary John Coltrane and the title track of his second album. \n\"Over the last year, Joey has grown by leaps and bounds as a composer, as an improviser and as a bandleader,\" Olaine said, noting that his new album showcases that. \"You can find some beauty and inspired playing, and very moving arrangements throughout the album, whether it's his original tunes or standards.\" \nRELATED: 13-Year-Old Jazz Pianist Joey Alexander Nominated for 2017 Grammy \nAlexander and his father, Denny Sila, worked out all the arrangements on his latest album, which pays tribute to several jazz masters that have inspired Alexander, including Herbie Hancock. On Hancock's \"Maiden Voyage,\" Alexander stretches out a bit with Chris Potter on saxophone, the first recording he's ever made with a horn player. \nAlexander also plays solo piano on a song he likes, Charles Chaplin's \"Smile.\" \nBorn in Bali, Indonesia, Alexander was six years old when his father gave him an electric keyboard. \"My dad played a little piano and guitar, but not professionally,\" Alexander said, who said he was drawn to music when he saw his father play. \nWhile he had a few piano lessons, Alexander learned to play jazz by ear by doing jam sessions with older musicians, and by listening and playing along with the jazz greats in his father's record collection. \n\"Duke Ellington, Billy Strayhorn, Thelonius Monk, Coltrane and Bill Evans. I heard all these amazing musicians,\" recalled Alexander. \nBefore long, Alexander's family moved to Jakarta, so he could play with some of Indonesia's best jazz artists. When he was 10, Wynton Marsalis, reknowned jazz trumpeter and the artistic director at Jazz at Lincoln Center, discovered Alexander on YouTube, and invited him to perform at the center's annual gala in New York City in 2014. Jazz pianist Joey Alexander said he learned to play jazz by ear by, doing jam sessions with older musicians, and by listening and playing along with the jazz greats in his father's record collection. Carol Friedman \nAlexander's producer Olaine, who also serves as Jazz at Lincoln Center's director of programming, remembers the reactions from other musicians when Alexander performed a Thelonius Monk tune at the gala's rehearsal. \n\"Everybody's like…jaws dropped, like looking at Joey and looking at each other… and they're laughing, like this can't possibly be what we're hearing,\" Olaine said. \"He took another take afterwards, it was a completely different arrangement.…You kind of shrug your shoulders, look at each other, scratch your head, and just go, 'OK, all right, I've never seen this before.\" \nEventually, Alexander's family moved to New York so he could pursue his passion for music, and early on, several major media outlets took notice of the new kid in town — including NBC News. Alexander still remembers what it was like at 11 years old to jam with NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt for a segment featured on the TODAY Show . \"He's a very calm and fun guy to talk with, and he's a pretty good bass player,\" Alexander said.
