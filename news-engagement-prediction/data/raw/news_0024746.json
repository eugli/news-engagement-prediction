The South Korean tech giant made the filing last month, and the name of its latest trademark seemingly implies that the company is preparing to release a revised version of the Galaxy J3 Pro, a mid-range Android smartphone released in mid-2016. The firm apparently filed for this trademark on the same day it filed for the “Galaxy J7 Sky Pro ” one. The device in question could possibly be the Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) that was recently certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance sporting the model number SM-J327VL. \nThe Galaxy J3 Pro was powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 and 2GB of RAM, in addition to sporting a 5-inch display with a resolution of 720 by 1280 pixels. It boasted 16GB of internal storage, an 8-megapixel rear camera, and a 5-megapixel front shooter. All of those specs were available at a relatively reasonable price, and it’s expected that the Galaxy J3 Luna Pro will offer more of the same. A revised version of the phone is expected to ship with the Snapdragon 430, 2GB of RAM and up to 32GB of internal storage. While a combination of such specs and an affordable price tag will likely be primarily aimed at emerging markets, the Galaxy J3 Luna Pro should also be released in the West. Furthermore, the name of the device implies that it’s going to be an upgrade over the Galaxy J3 Emerge , an entry-level Android phone Samsung made official last month. \nOverall, it remains to be seen whether this trademark will amount to anything in the near future, but with Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2017 just around the corner, it’s possible that Samsung will soon unveil the Galaxy J3 Luna Pro. While the South Korean consumer electronics manufacturer already confirmed it won’t be announcing the Galaxy S8 at this year’s MWC, it will still hold a press conference on February 26, a day before the Barcelona-based trade show officially kicks off. The company already promised to unveil new products during that conference, so more information on the Galaxy J3 Luna Pro could follow soon.
