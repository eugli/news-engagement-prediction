They put this on in an effort to show there’s no free speech on a college campus like UC Berkeley?” \nREICH: “I wouldn’t bet against it, Don. Again, I saw these people. They all looked almost paramilitary. They were not from the campus. And I’ve heard — again, I don’t want to say factually, but I’ve heard there was some relationship here between these people and the right wing and the right-wing movement that is affiliated with Breitbart News.” \nLEMON: “It is interesting because there have been protests but nothing this violent. We haven’t seen anything to this level.” \nWell, that’s a theory certainly not unexpected from Reich. Me, when CNN says the #Berkeley rioters were 'right wing' pic.twitter.com/xSdre6rHmD \n— Jason C.
