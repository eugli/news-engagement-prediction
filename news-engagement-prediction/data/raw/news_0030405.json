OPEC and other producers, including Russia, agreed late last year to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of 2017. \nThe group is expected to publish its first assessment of compliance with the deal, yesterday. It was learned that compliance, according to OPEC calculations, was 92 percent in January, while the International Energy Agency said the rate was 90 percent. However, Kuwait’s oil minister said that OPEC compliance was 92 percent while that of non-OPEC producers was 50 percent. adekunle ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:01:50.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
