Brayden was the last to go home and went home in recent days.\nTotal days spent in NICU :\nBrandon - 42\nKenlee - 47\nBryant - 57\nBrayden - 65\nAs reported back in December, multiples run in Kortney Miller’s family. But she’s the first to give birth to quadruplets. In December, Miller and her husband, Justin, welcomed four babies: Brandon, Brayden, Bryant and sister Kenlee. Delivered at 29 weeks, each weighed around 3 pounds. The babies were conceived naturally, a one in 700,000 chance, according to Piedmont Newnan Hospital, where the babies were delivered.\n Since then, they have all gained about 2 pounds since birth and are doing well.\n\"Things are going great and we are so happy to have them all home,” said mom Kortney Miller in a press release. “We have a good support system. The hardest thing is nighttime feedings because they have to eat every 4 hours and it takes about 2.5 hours to do that each time for all four between eating, burping and changing. Kenlee has to see an eye specialist in Atlanta which is also challenging. It takes teamwork. Justin and I switch off and Bentlee is a great big brother helping where he can.\"\n“The quads are all healthy and met their required milestones to go home and we expect them to continue to grow and thrive,” said Dr. Adegboyega Aderibigbe neonatologist at Piedmont Newnan’s Level 3 NICU said in a press release. “It is a celebration for us when our NICU babies go home and we look forward to seeing them progress along their journey.”\nKortney Miller gave birth to quadruplets in December.
