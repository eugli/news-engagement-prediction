To be honest, there are a few lines of dialog here and there that feel a tad unnatural, but that's easy to forgive, because it's such a wonderful movie. Greg Kinnear, always great, is a gem here. I highly recommend it. ONE OF THE BEST!!! PERIOD!! by animatman James L. Brooks scored a big \"10\" with this one. Jack is brilliant, as the rest of the cast in this great scripted film. If you haven't seen this, Please!!!! rent it NOW!! If you have seen it, Well???
