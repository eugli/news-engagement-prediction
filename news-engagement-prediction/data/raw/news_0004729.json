\nHollywood does love football. (Photo: USA TODAY/ NBC; FXX; Columbia TriStar; Disney; Warner Bros.) \nReady, set, watch. \nThere's a little football game this weekend, in case you haven't heard. The New England Patriots are taking on the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday in Super Bowl LI. In honor of the big game we've rounded up five of our favorite movies and TV shows all about football. You'll need to watch something while you're making that seven-layer dip, after all. If you want a new obsession: Friday Night Lights \nIf you've made it to 2017 without having seen Friday Night Lights , we're a little jealous. Now you get to watch it for the first time! You've probably heard praise for the show, which starred Kyle Chandler as the coach of a Texas high school football team, and for good reason. It's not just one of the best football shows, it's just one of the best shows of all time. The second season is a slight dip in quality but if you stay the course, this show will reward you. \nStream Friday Night Lights on Netflix . If fantasy is your thing: The League \nReal-life football is good and all, but you're probably better at fantasy than you are on the actual field. This FXX comedy follows a group of friends in a fantasy league and their antics. It's not always specifically about football, but it's entertaining, and features comedians like Nick Kroll and Mark Duplass. \nStream The League on Netflix . If you want to to be quoting it all weekend: Jerry Maguire \n\"Show me the money.\" \"You had me at hello.\" \"You complete me.\" You know all the lines from the movie starring Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Renée Zellweger. The film recently had its 20th anniversary , if you can believe it. You can celebrate the anniversary and football by spending a little time with Jerry this weekend. \nStream Jerry Maguire on Starz . If you want to be moved: Remember the Titans \nThe story of a newly-integrated football team in 1971 Virginia has a renewed relevance in 2017. Plus, it never hurts to celebrate the amazing acting of Denzel Washington, who just picked up a SAG Award for his performance in Fences (which he also directed, what an overachiever). \nStream Remember the Titans on Amazon with a Cinemax subscription . If you want humor and to root for the underdog: The Replacements \nA lot of football movies are inspirational and deal with big issues. The Replacements is not one of those football movies. It's a comedy starring Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman about a rag-tag group of wannabes who join a professional football team when the regular players are on strike. It has some inspiring sports movie moments, but with a lot more cheek. \nRent The Replacements on Amazon , Google Play , YouTube or Vudu . \nYou can scroll through more of our binge recommendations below (see last week's here ). Facebook Posted!   Looking for something to watch this weekend? Look no further. We know that sometimes instead of watching TV, you just scroll endlessly through the streaming options. Which is why we are here for you, every week, with five shows, movies or TV episodes that you should add to your queue. Scroll through all of our recommendations here. First up for those looking for the next thing? 'Insecure.' HBO's new comedy starring Issa Rae was a bright spot in the flood of new shows this fall. The show is unique, hilarious and effortlessly written and acted. HBO Fullscreen If you're late to the party: 'Westworld.' HBO's high-concept drama about robots populating a futuristic theme park is just one of those shows. You know, with 1,001 theories about what is actually going on, plus episodes you have to watch with more concentration than you bring to your job. But hey, all that work is being rewarded, at least for the actors involved. John P. Johnson, AP If you're even later to the party: 'Stranger Things.' You probably didn't make it through the summer (or Halloween) without hearing about the paranormal Netflix show. If you haven't quite gotten around to watching yet, now's your perfect chance. Netflix If you like your TV with an extra dash of sweetness: 'This Is Us.' The time-jumping NBC drama about a complicated family may be a bit too saccharine for some but might hit the happy-cry sweet spot for others. NBC, Ron Batzdorff, NBC Fullscreen If you want something light and lovely: 'Lovesick.' The British romantic sitcom is a delightful portrait of a man and his romantic relationships. After he discovers he has an STD and has to contact his former partners, his life (and crush on his best friend) is told in flashbacks. Neil Davidson, Netflix Fullscreen If you want to stir the pot a little bit: 'Catastrophe.' The show, which was created by and stars comedians Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan, follows a mature pair that accidentally gets pregnant during a vacation fling and decides to give commitment a try. It's one of the most realistic portraits of a couple working hard to stay together, and it's downright hilarious. Ed Miller, Amazon Studios Fullscreen If you want easy escapism: 'Happy Endings.' Sometimes you just want to sit at a bar and be close to your friends, no matter how weird they are. 'Happy Endings' may be a sitcom about 30-something friends and their love lives, but it's no 'Friends' knock-off. The show is full of unique characters, enviable relationships and genuine hilarity. The silly costumes and pratfalls are just a bonus. Jordin Althaus, ABC Fullscreen If you really want to appreciate it when your friends joke that \"winter is coming\": 'Game of Thrones.' You've been meaning to watch the show. You really have. There are just so many shows. But now is the perfect time to just take the plunge. You'll finally know what White Walkers are. Helen Sloan, HBO If you love superheroes: 'Luke Cage.' The show, which USA TODAY's Brian Truitt called the very best Marvel-on-TV offering, is an intense and rewarding binge. Myles Aronowitz, Netflix If you want positivity: 'Supergirl.' Take a trip to sunny National City and fly around with Kara Zor-El in the most optimistic show on television. Darren Michaels, AP If you loved 'Downton Abbey.' 'The Crown.' Netflix's series following the the reign of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, the current and longest-ruling monarch is downright dazzling. Robert Viglasky, Netflix Fullscreen If you think winter is the most beautiful season of all: 'Frozen Planet.' Celebrate the wonder and majesty of the colder parts of the Earth in the acclaimed BBC docu-series. If you can resist the cuteness of the penguins, you are stronger than we are. Jason Roberts, AP If you like 'Mad Men.': 'Good Girls Revolt.' Amazon's new (and relevant) period piece. Jessica Miglio, Amazon Studios Fullscreen If you want to gossip with your relatives: 'Suits.' What better dinner-table conversation is there for you and your family than Prince Harry's love life? The younger British prince has a new girlfriend, American actress Meghan Markle. Markle is best known for the USA show, which follows a con artist posing as a lawyer at a top NYC firm. It's the type of blue- sky USA show that works for a big group, and has the added bonus of helping you get to know Markle. Shane Mahood, USA Network Fullscreen If you're looking for thrills: 'The Night Manager.' Remember the fever pitch of speculation that Tom Hiddleston might play James Bond? The Night Manager is why. The show, which aired on AMC, featured Hiddleston as a spy trying to infiltrate a criminal's inner circle. It's got action and thrills and a great performance from the actor. Des Willie, AMC Fullscreen If you love an under-appreciated gem: 'The Day After Tomorrow.' This movie happens to be the perfect kind of flick to sort of half-watch while you fold laundry or bake cookies or finally clean your living room. Come for the dazzling special effects, stay for baby Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum. KERRY HAYES, XXX 20TH CENTURY FOX Fullscreen If you can't wait for the Winter Olympics: 'The Cutting Edge.' We have two words for you if you've never seen the 90s ice-skating classic: \"Toe pick!\" The film, starring Moira Kelly and D.B. Sweeney, follows figure-skating pair made of a classically trained (if a little uptight) woman and former pro-hockey player who suffered an injury. There's ice, there's beautiful skating, and, of course, there's love. Handout Fullscreen If your favorite part of winter is getting unexpected time off: 'Snow Day.' Remember this one? The 2000 Nickelodeon movie starring Chevy Chase about, you guessed it, a snow day? It's a cheesy, over-the-top masterpiece of all the thing you love about kids movies. And it's just waiting for you to relive it. Paramount Pictures Fullscreen If you like a western: 'Hell or High Water.' The low key western starring Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine and Ben Foster is an awards favorite for 2017. The film follows two brothers who rob different branches of the same bank to pay off their mothers' debt. Lorey Sebastian, CBS Films If you need something to watch with your mom: 'When Harry Met Sally.' The classic rom-com will please everyone. Well, except when you all get kind of uncomfortable in the \"I'll have what she's having\" scene. ANDY SCHWARTZ, CASTLE ROCK ENTERTAINMENT Fullscreen If you need something to watch with your dad: 'Top Gun.' Finding something that everyone will agree to watch can be tough, but your family can probably all agree on hanging out with Maverick. 'Top Gun' has the action, comedy and romance to please most members of your family. Paramount If you're a Broadway fan: 'Lady Day At Emerson’s Bar & Grill.' Audra McDonald is a Broadway legend, and for Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill she turned her talents on a legend of music: Billie Holliday. Evgenia Eliseeva Fullscreen If you love msuicals: 'Sing Street.' USA TODAY Film Critic Brian Truitt called Sing Streetthe best film of 2016 (so far), and it's easy to see why. The film, by Once director John Carney, finds optimism and hope in music, telling an 80s-set coming of age story. Come for the music, stay for the love. The Weinstein Company Fullscreen If you like \"feel good\" movies: 'Akeelah and the Bee.' If you can get through this story of a young girl overcoming incredible odds to win the National Spelling Bee without ugly-crying all over the place, we don't know what to do with you. The movie that gave us Keke Palmer is one of the most upbeat, inspirational movies we can think of, with a joyful ending that is anything but cheesy. Saeed Adyani, Lionsgate Fullscreen If you're cynical: 'Veep.' The show does not assume all politicians are idealists trying to make the world a better place. It assumes all politicians are conniving and ambitious and thoughtless and will do anything to get ahead. It might just hit the spot this year. LACEY TERRELL, HBO Fullscreen If you miss 'The West Wing': 'The American President.' Before he was President Bartlett, Martin Sheen spent time in another White House staff created by Aaron Sorkin. The West Wing creator wrote The American President first, about a first-term president running for re-election while dating a lobbyist. It's got the same kind of inspiration as the show, but in a tighter, more romantic package. Associated Press Fullscreen If you love camp: 'American Horror Story.' The creator of Glee was never going to do horror in any sort of conventional way. The FX anthology series takes on different tropes from the genre and turns them on their heads while also managing to brutally terrify the audience. The show is not for someone averse to violence (this is not a jump-scare show, this is a graphic-scare show). Some seasons are better than others (let’s just pretend Hotel didn’t happen), but the benefit of the anthology structure is that you can pick and choose which ones to watch. Prashant Gupta, FX Fullscreen If you want to jump on the bandwagon: 'The Walking Dead.' Forget Carl and the detour to the farm in Season 2, and the show’s general tendency to swing back and forth in quality. Remember instead that heart-stopping pilot, the Governor’s assault on the prison and Terminus. Although it mostly relies on creative ways to kill zombies for its horror, Walking Dead has genuinely been able to surprise and scare us. Gene Page, AMC Fullscreen If you wished the 'X-Files' revival was better: 'Fringe.' Sorry, Scully. If you’re looking for a weekly foray into the supernatural, you should probably check out the J.J. Abrams-produced Fringe instead of the actual new X-Files. Fringe started out as a modern take on the X-Files formula, and quickly evolved into a sci-fi serial with multiple universes, doppelgangers and a lot of Leonard Nimoy. It’s mysterious occurrences tended to be more horrific than weird, equally terrifying and intriguing. Michael Courtney, Michael Courtney If you want 2016's best horror movie: 'The Witch.' The film is a creepy, genuinely shocking slice of horror. Plus, in a year when society's treatment of women is under the microscope, this puritanical movie is surprisingly relevant. A24 If you like the classics: 'The Blair Witch Project.' You’ve seen it a few times already, sure, but the found-footage flick can still pull off a few scares. Artisan Entertainment Fullscreen If you're looking for a new weekly show: 'Pitch.' If you would like to, ahem, take a swing at a new network show this fall, you may want to try Pitch. The first episode is a little rough (especially if it's hard to watch people fail and/or be embarrassed), but the story of the first female major league baseball player has garnered critical praise and buzz. According to USA TODAY TV Critic Robert Bianco, \"with some fine performances and a good sense for the frenzy Ginny might cause, Pitch is, all told, an entertaining hour.\" Ray Mickshaw, AP Fullscreen If you love Danny McBride: 'Eastbound and Down.' Although Eastbound and Down doesn't technically take place in the hallowed halls of a professional baseball field, the sport is in the DNA of the Will Ferrell and Adam McKay-produced HBO series. Danny McBride stars as a burnt-out professional baseball player that's forced to return to his hometown and teach P.E. at his old middle school. Things go just as you might guess for the man who is not exactly the nicest you'll ever meet. Fred Norris Fullscreen If you like a traditional rom-com: 'Fever Pitch.' Fever Pitch is perhaps the height of the Drew Barrymore romantic comedy. Sure, she's swapped out Adam Sandler for Jimmy Fallon (remember when he was going to be a movie star instead of just telling stars how much he likes their movies?), but the tropes are all there. She's a bumbling romantic lead, there's a weird conceit keeping her and her man apart and, after rushing Fenway Park, everything works out in the end. OK, the Fenway thing only happens in Fever Pitch but you get it. Darren Michaels, 20th Century Fox Fullscreen If you want to feel good: 'A League of Their Own.' There's no crying in baseball, but re-watching the Geena Davis and Tom Hanks-starring film about the women's baseball league during WWII might just make you tear up. Maybe it's when the Peaches win the World Series or when we learn Betty's husband died in the war or when everyone reunites at the end. No matter what, you'll feel good after watching. Columbia Pictures Fullscreen 'Major League.' Sometimes baseball movies are all about heart and inspiration and sportsmanship. And sometimes, they're just about revenge. Take the Cleveland Indians in Major League, who are assembled to be the worst baseball team in history (this year not so much). Once they figure it out, they take revenge by being the best team of the season. In addition to being genuinely dirty and hilarious, the movie features a young Charlie Sheen as a player nick-named \"Wild Thing\". And yes, they play the song. AP Fullscreen 'Girls.' Lena Dunham's star-making HBO show just wrapped filming its final season, so you have just enough time to figure out what everyone's been yelling about the entire time it's been on the air. Girls ended up being as dramatic and think piece-driven as sister HBO show Game of Thrones, but it never lost its core focus on its four titular Girls. Being young and stupid in the city isn't the same as it was in Friends, and Dunham helped show us something new. Jessica Miglio, HBO Fullscreen 'Gossip Girl.' Our use of \"XOXO\" in texts, emails and real life can be traced back to Blair, Serena and the rest. The soapy CW drama may have started out as the adventures of privileged adolescents at an Upper East Side private high school, but a few dozen twists later it became so much more. KC Bailey, The CW Fullscreen 'New Girl.' Sometimes you just need something quirky, fun and funny after a long week. May we direct you to this delightful Fox comedy? There have been cast additions and subtractions, weddings and Megan Fox but, despite the upheaval, it's still going strong in its sixth season. Don't you think it's time to catch up? Greg Gayne, FOX Fullscreen 'Gone Girl.' Sorry, guys, it seems the most recent Girl is a bit of trainwreck. But you know how people were calling it the next Gone Girl? Well, you can actually just watch the original Gone Girl instead! There's a reason both the book and the film were such an event. The story of a missing suburban housewife seems pretty standard... until it isn't. And even if you've been spoiled on The Big Twist (and if you haven't, we commend you), there is still so much mileage to Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck's performances to keep you going. Merrick Morton, 20th Century Fox Fullscreen 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.' No offense to the Rooney Mara adaptation, but the best version of Lisbeth Salander is portrayed by Ms. Noomi Rapace. The original Swedish version (in addition to adapting all three of Stieg Larsson's novels) is rawer and more brutal than the David Fincher-directed American version, but what keeps it grounded is Rapace's blockbuster performance. You need to be in the right mood for this violent, dark mystery, but it's a rewarding watch if you are. Knut Koivisto, Music Box Films Fullscreen You think you know Fleabag, the vulgar, drinking, smoking, sex-loving title character of the British import available on Amazon, but you don't.The show — which explores Fleabag's crumpled life (she's struggling professionally, personally, financially and romantically) after she suffers a loss — is as hilarious as it is heart-wrenching. Hal Shinnie, Amazon 'Smallville': You can thank the recent glut of superhero shows (yes, even Luke Cage) on the path that Tom Welling and the WB set for 10 seasons, chronicling Clark Kent (aka Superman) as a teenager in Smallville, Kansas. The WB Fullscreen You've seen Making a Murderer. And The Case Of: JonBenét Ramsey. And OJ: Made in America. Now what? Amanda Knox. The new Netflix documentary takes another crime that dominated the headlines and looks at it in a very different and new way. Netflix via AP You're not too old for this. There's a new version of Riggs and Murtaugh on TV (and hey, they aren't half bad according to our TV critic Robert Bianco), which means you should absolutely revisit the original 'Lethal Weapon.' Warner Bros. Fullscreen For a Brangelina-themed week we picked some of our favorite movies from the couple. One of them is 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,' which may be a sci-fi flick, but it's really a snapshot of Hollywood in 2004, when it hit theaters (around the time Brad and Angelina first got together). The film stars Jolie along with Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow, a reminder about what mattered at the box office and in our hearts back then. NONE, XXX Paramount Pictures Fullscreen You've seen Tomb Raider. But this is a really good weekend to watch it again. The action flick is an hour and 40 minutes of Jolie beating the odds, knocking heads and taking names. She may have moved away from her action star persona, but she will always be one of the greats. ALEX BAILEY, PARAMOUNT PICTURES Pitt did strong work in last year's The Big Short, which he also produced. He's not the star, but the film has an incredibly strong cast, so you don't miss him when he's not there. Jaap Buitendijk, Paramount Do you want sadness? Babel will give you unrelenting sadness if you let it. The drama, which follows conflicts all over the world dealing with violence and language barriers, is a morose choice, but sometimes that's what you want. Murray Close, PARAMOUNT CLASSICS Fullscreen Besides its infamous role in bringing the couple together, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' is actually a smart, funny action flick about two undercover spies who are married but work for opposite sides. It may be too fraught when you think about the context, but it's still a highly enjoyable film. Stephen Vaughn, AP Don't sleep on Netflix's 'Grace and Frankie.'The show, about two women in their 70s whose husbands leave them for each other, is a pure delight, doling out hearty laughs and heartfelt scenes in equal measure. Karen Ballard, Netflix Baz Luhrmann, the man who dazzled you with 'Moulin Rouge,' 'Romeo + Juliet' and 'The Great Gatsby,' has absconded to Netflix to tell a story about the rise of hip-hop in the Bronx in the 1970s in 'The Get Down.' Netflix Fullscreen 'Suits' is really a beach read come to life. Once you get over the USA Network show's admittedly absurd concept (an underachiever with a photographic memory poses as a lawyer at a high-power NYC firm and wins big cases ) you can enjoy the soapy drama. Christos Kalohoridis, Christos Kalohoridis/USA Network Fullscreen 'The Bank Job' is exactly what it sounds like: a 1970s-set British heist movie about a group of thieves trying to rob a bank. But what doesn't come across in its simple the title is the fact that it stars the one and only Jason Statham, that it includes a possibly true royal scandal and that it has intrigue, murder and a very steamy romance. 'The Bank Job' is genuinely fun, with a British sense of humor and none of that technological cheating when it comes to the actual robbing -- it's the 70s and they dig a tunnel. Jack English, Lionsgate Fullscreen 'I Capture the Castle,' based on the novel of the same name, follows the aptly named romantic lead Cassandra Mortmain who lives in a crumbling English castle with her family whose finances are crumbling, too.Everything is turned upside down when two rich American men come into the picture. The 2003 film has a talented cast, including Rose Byrne, as Cassandra's ambitious sister, and Bill Nighy who plays her father. The movie verges on cheesy, but it manages to balance its drama and romance. Samuel Goldwyn Films Fullscreen For our Olympic-themed edition we suggested 'Make It or Break It.'If you love gymnastics but want a little more drama, try this Freeform (well, ABC Family when it was on the air) show, which follows a group of gymnasts trying to make it to the Olympics. Isabella Vosmikova, ABC Family If you've never seen, 'Sports Night,' Aaron Sorkin's take on fast walking-and-talking, smart, heart of gold sportscasters, you're missing out. ABC Fullscreen Nothing, nothing will get you more into the Olympic spirit than 'Miracle,' the Disney film that follows the 1980 USA men's hockey team on their quest to win the gold (and beat the Soviet Union). It's got motivational speeches, patriotism, Kurt Russell and a whole lot of action. Watch it and try not to get hype. Disney Fullscreen ESPN's 30 for 30 series has given us some incredibly documentaries (including this summer's break-out hit 'O.J.: Made in America'), but one of the very best is 'The Price of Gold,' which tells the full story behind the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan drama that dominated the Olympics and headlines in 1994. Doug Mills, AP OK. You've seen 'Cool Runnings.' You love 'Cool Runnings.' But now is the time to re-watch 'Cool Runnings,' if only so you can appreciate the fact that the summer and winter games are no longer in the same year. Rob McEwan, Disney Fullscreen 'BoJack Horseman' aims its satire directly at Hollywood and all its quirks while also digging into depression, mental health and what makes us happy. The half-hour episodes will fly by and you won't be able to get the post-credits song out of your head after awhile, but its all worth it. Netflix Fullscreen Have you watched 'Stranger Things' yet? Why haven't you watched 'Stranger Things' yet? The Netflix show is the Internet's latest obsession, and for good reason. The show follows what happens in a small town in Indiana in 1983 after a young boy goes missing. Netflix 'Arrow' has had it's ups and downs (it is something of the testing ground for all things DC Comics on TV) but the show's second season is some of the best superhero action you can find on TV. Diyah Pera, The CW 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is a raunchy comedy distinctly of the '40 Year-Old Virgin' era, but it's also incredibly sweet and has the best Dracula puppet musical in any movie ever. Glen Wilson, Universal Do you need an excuse to revisit the 'Harry Potter' movies? Jaap Buitendijk, Warner Bros. Pictures Our first pick for our Comic-Con week is 'The Flash.'If you are intimidated by the multitude of DC Comics TV shows on the CW these days, start here. Katie Yu, The CW 'Jessica Jones,' the second of the Netflix/Marvel super-shows is the best so far, but one for the adults in your life. Myles Aronowitz/Netflix Fullscreen We've been treated to a lot of big-screen Batmen over the past few years, but our favorite may always be the Dark Knight from 'Batman: The Animated Series.' Bonus: It has our favorite Joker, too, voiced by Mark Hamill (yes, Luke Skywalker took a bit of a turn to the Dark Side). Warner Bros. Listen, there are a few thousand Marvel movies these days (OK, 13). But in this reporter's humble opinion, the best — and the most pertinent — is the first 'Avengers' flick, which epitomizes the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel Star Trek crew from left: Chekov (Anton Yelchin), James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), Scotty (Simon Pegg), Bones (Karl Urban), Sulu (John Cho), and Uhura (Zoë Saldana) in a scene from 2009's \"Star Trek.\" Industrial Light & Magic, Paramount Pictures Fullscreen For our \"restore your faith in humanity\" edition, we started with 'Call the Midwife.' Few shows are as consistently life-affirming as this BBC gem, which follows a group of young nurses working as midwives in the East End of London in the baby boom of the 1950s. PBS 'Psych' is ostensibly a crime procedural, which is not a particularly heartwarming genre of television. But unlike your 'SVUs,' 'CSIs' and 'Criminal Minds,' 'Psych' comes from a place of joy, with an outlook on life that is distinctly rosy. Alan Zenuk, USA Network When you're looking for some Grade-A comfort food, look no further than 'Cheers.' Because sometimes you truly just want to know where everybody knows your name. Or at least, watch your favorite actors hang out there. NBC Fullscreen You don't need to look any further to find the good in people as 'Batkid Begins,' the true story of an entire city (plus President Obama and some other fine folks) coming together to make one little boy's dream come true: Be Batman for a day. We'd say more, but we're tearing up a little thinking about it. Paul Sakuma, Make-A-Wish Foundation Fullscreen Will and Jaden Smith star in 'The Pursuit of Happyness,' based on the true story of Chris Gardner, an entrepreneur who worked his way up to a position as a stockbroker while homeless. It's one movie where the spoiler only makes it better: knowing that Chris eventually succeeds after all the times life knocks him down. Zade Rosenthal, Sony Pictures Fullscreen For our wedding edition, you should try 'The Office.' This pick may surprise you, but over nine seasons the show has its fair share of successful and not-so successful weddings. What comes to mind, of course, is Jim and Pam's romantic and wet wedding in Niagra falls, but don't forget Phyllis's or Dwight's. Byron Cohen, NBC Universal Sometimes, sometimes, you just need to sit down on your couch, order pizza, maybe get some wine, and watch this show for like 6 straight hours. It is never a bad call. TLC We've all seen 'Bridesmaids.' We all love it. But it never hurts to revisit. Suzanne Hanover, Universal Studios Fullscreen No, we're not talking about 'The Bachelor' reality show, but the sweet rom-com about a man who needs to get married in order to come into an inheritance. When things don't work out with his girlfriend or any of his exes, he places an ad. A little iffy on the gender politics? Sure. Goofy and fun? Absolutely. New Line Cinema Fullscreen If you're looking for a little darkness in your wedding comedy, look no further than 'Monsoon Wedding,' which follows a family re-united for a wedding in Delhi. And as a bonus, the film is directed by Mira Nair, who directed 'The Namesake' and is directing Lupita Nyong'o in Disney's upcoming 'The Queen of Katwe.' USA Films For our 4th of July edition our first pick is 'The West Wing.'The obvious choice, but probably the best. In a busy, long and dark election season, West Wing is a good antidote. NBC If you want to celebrate the 4th with something that takes place during the American Revolution, and you can’t get tickets to 'Hamilton,' 'Turn' is right for you. Antony Platt, AMC You know what your plans are for the 4th, so you might as well lean in! But in all seriousness, 'Drunk History' is smart and funny and just happens to be the perfect accompaniment to your barbecue and partying plans. Comedy Central Fullscreen There are a few things we know to be true in life. One of those things is that there is no crying in baseball. Another of those things is that we've yet to watch 'A League of Their Own' without tearing up just a little bit. Louis Goldman Fullscreen 'Independence Day: Resurgence' may be not-so-great, but the original is still a 4th of July classic. And you have to admit, Bill Pullman's speech is one of the most rousing and inspirational political speeches ever (and, if we're being very honest, including real life political speeches, too). 20th Century Fox For the summer edition of our guide, we start with 'The O.C.' Travel, if you will, to Southern California and spend some time with Summer, Seth, Ryan and Marissa. FOX Fullscreen An episode of 'Burn Notice' is very much like your favorite summery cocktail. It’s fun, it’s brightly colored and there are amazing sunglasses. The USA spy dramedy is good for picking up some spy tips, good for watching while you fold laundry and good for reminding you why you want to live in a beach town. Glenn Watson, USA Network Fullscreen You’ve heard about that (apparently actually pretty good?) new movie where Blake Lively plays a surfer trying to survive a shark attack? It has us remembering our favorite surfer movie of all time, the Kate Bosworth and Michelle Rodriguez-starring 'Blue Crush.' Universal Fullscreen 'Now and Then' helped us get through middle school and we hope it helped you too. There have been few movies that are such pure celebrations of female friendship and so directly confronting the challenges of adolescence and puberty. It reminds you of the time when summer meant you spent every waking hour with your friends. And that’s what you need sometimes. New Line Cinema Fullscreen 'Troop Beverly Hills' follows Shelley Long as a fish-out-of-water trophy wife who ends up leader of her daughter’s scout troop and must brave the outdoors. It’s heartwarming, it’s fun and it actually really tense during one particular scene with a tree log (you know the one). Bill Heitzel First up in our dad edition of our guide is 'Fresh Off the Boat,' which features one of our favorite TV dads of all time: Louis Huang (Randall Park). Nicole Wilder, ABC Fullscreen If your dad has no idea who McSteamy is, he might enjoy Eric Dane as Commander Tom Chandler in 'The Last Ship,' TNT's post-apocalyptic drama. It’s a story you’ve heard before (virus outbreak threatens life as we know it) but told through a naval ship that is carrying the doctor who might save us all. Karen Ballard, TNT Fullscreen This may seem out of left field but listen, your dad loves 'Orphan Black.' Truly. He likes sci-fi and action and he thinks Tatiana Maslany should have an Emmy. We may be talking about one very specific dad here, but trust us, other dads will fall in line. George Kraychyk, BBC AMERICA More than just the “other movie starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez,” 'Jersey Girl' is a sweet movie about fathers and daughters. And because it’s directed by Kevin Smith, it contains some delightfully wacky tributes to Sweeney Todd. Miramax Fullscreen 'Bridge of Spies' is the dad-est movie to ever dad. This is a period piece, set in the Cold War, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance. This is your dad’s favorite movie of all time. Jaap Buitendijk, DreamWorks For the musicals edition of our guide, we start with 'Glee,' the perfect choice for any Broadway obsessive (although we're mostly talking about season 1). Carin Baer, FOX Many, many TV shows have tried to execute a musical episode. Many have failed. The one that did it, and did it really, truly right, was 'Buffy,' with season 6, episode 7: \"Once More With Feeling.\" MITCHELL HAASETH, XXX UPN A scene from the Disney animated film 'Mulan' Disney 'Chicago' remains one of the best film adaptations of a Broadway show, managing to beautifully translate the songs and the spectacle to the screen without losing the essence of the show. Future 'Hamilton' musical, take notes. Miramax Fullscreen If you've never heard of 'Camp', your life is about to change. The movie follows a group of pre-teens and teens at a musical theater summer camp, figuring out who they are and singing their way through it. Bonus: It features a teeny, tiny Anna Kendrick as a back-stabbing manipulator. IFC Films 'Parenthood' is our No. 1 pick for our weepy edition of the binge guide. Just thinking about the drama is enough to make us cry. Colleen Hayes, NBC Fullscreen GREY'S ANATOMY - \"Grey's Anatomy\" concludes the season with a shocking two-hour telecast, THURSDAY, MAY 14 (9:00-11:00 p.m., ET) on the ABC Television Network. In the second part, \"Now or Never\" (10:00-11:00 p.m.), George delivers stunning news to Bailey, sending shockwaves throughout the hospital, and Izzie's friends anxiously await her recovery from surgery. Meanwhile Bailey is surprisingly displeased after being accepted into the pediatric fellowship program, and the victim of a near-fatal traffic accident brings the talents of Seattle Grace's doctors together. (ABC/SCOTT GARFIELD) ELLEN POMPEO, PATRICK DEMPSEY (Via MerlinFTP Drop) Scott Garfield, ABC Fullscreen 'Parks and Recreation,' while one of our favorite sitcoms of all time, has the uncanny ability to make us cry. Sometimes it's a happy cry (see: any engagement or wedding episode), and sometimes it's a little sad (see: any breakup), but we always feel so much better afterwards. Colleen Hayes, NBC This summer's 'Me Before You's clear predecessor is 'The Fault in Our Stars,' which follows two young teens battling cancer who fall in love. We'd say you'd laugh and you'd cry, but mostly you'll cry. James Bridges, 20th Century Fox Fullscreen If we're going to get very personal about this, Clint Eastwood's boxing drama 'Million Dollar Baby' is the movie that makes us cry the most out of any movie. Ever. It is worth revisiting any time. Even if you don't feel like crying. It's worth it. Merie W. Wallace, XXX Warner Bros. Pictures If you're excited for 'The Bachelorette' this summer, check out the critically-acclaimed Lifetime show'UnREAL,' which gives you a (supposedly) behind the scenes look at a 'Bachelor'-like reality show. James Dittiger, Lifetime Fullscreen You are being watched. That’s how every episode of CBS’s underrated Person of Interest starts, and we only wish that a few more people had taken a gander at the show itself. Now you can do it on Netflix. Barbara Nitke, CBS Fullscreen Looking for a grittier crime drama? Maybe one with an English flair? Peaky Blinders is for you if you want to spend this sunny weekend in darkness (we know that’s true for some of you). The British period drama stars Cillian Murphy, and the third season drops on Netflix on May 31. Robert Viglasky/Netflix, Robert Viglasky/Netflix Fullscreen Disappointed by 'Alice 2'? Find Mia Wasikowska in a much better, trippy fantasy movie in the form of Crimson Peak. The horror/fantasy film was acclaimed director Guillermo del Toro’s passion project, and is a gift to the many legions of Tom Hiddleston fans. Kerry Hayes, Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures Travel back in time (and do your homework for latest mutant film 'X-Men: Apocalypse') with the star-studded 'X-Men: Days of Future Past.' Alan Markfield, 20th Century Fox In a College Edition of our recommendations, we picked the seminal 'Felicity.' Can't go wrong with the choice to follow Keri Russell to New York. Andrew Eccles/Warner Bros., TLP 'Greek' is what you need for a nuanced college TV show. RON TOM, ABC FAMILY The study group may have changed, but Greendale Community College was the rock that kept 'Community' going through its rocky six seasons. It's always worth revisiting. Justin Lubin, Justin Lubin/NBC If you're looking for a college movie, look no further than 'Pitch Perfect,' which has three of our favorite things: A capella, smart comedy and Rebel Wilson. Peter Iovino, Universal Pictures Also worth revisiting is the underrated Justin Long comedy, 'Accepted,' which follows a group of teens who didn't get into any college at all, so they create their own. It's got a very, very young Jonah Hill to boot. Suzanne Hanover, XXX Universal Pictures In honor of shows that have been canceled in May 2016, we are offering you still-airing shows to watch instead. Going to miss 'Nashville'? Why not try The CW's 'Jane the Virgin' for your dose of family melodrama. Greg Gayne, CW If 'Castle' was your favorite you can scratch that itch with Sherlock.' PBS We need more TV musicals and since 'Galavant' is no more, maybe try The CW's 'Crazy-Ex Girlfriend.' Scott Everett White, The CW We'll miss seeing Rob Lowe in 'The Grinder' but we can't tell you how thankful we war for Julia Louis-Dreyfus in 'Veep.' Patrick Harbron, HBO In honor of Mother's Day 2016, we had some mom-friendly recommendations, starting with the ultimate mom-and-daughter show, 'Gilmore Girls.' The WB If your mom loves melodrama and tears, try Freeform's 'The Fosters,' which follows a very complicated family through very relatable struggles. Randy Holmes, ABC Family Only have time for one episode with your mom? Try \"Band Candy,\" from season 3 of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer.' It's like 'Freaky Friday,' but with more snake demons. The WB Your mom loves 'Mamma Mia!' We shouldn't have to tel you this. Go watch it with her. Peter Mountain, Universal Studios If you are willing to shed a few tears with your mom, try 'Anywhere But Here,' a heart-tugging mom-and-daughter drama with Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon. 20th Century Fox Like this topic?
