The neighborhood—which once served as a bohemian retreat for Hollywood icons such as Walt Disney , Clark Gable , and Will Rogers —is dotted with 1920s cabins from movie sets. \nOwners Marla and Larry Butler wanted to preserve the California coastal-meets-country lifestyle by constructing a 6,195-square-foot estate on a property that once housed one of these cabins.
