And now you know. 02/16/2017 05:35 pm ET Julia Brucculieri Entertainment   \nIn Hollywood, celebrity relationships come and go, often getting forgotten as new romances emerge. Case in point: Nicole Kidman and Lenny Kravitz not only once dated but were engaged, too. \nKidman revealed the news in a recent interview with Net-A-Porter’s The Edit. While discussing her new show, “Big Little Lies,” and her co-stars ― one of whom, Zoë Kravitz, is Lenny’s daughter ― Kidman said she already knew the “Divergent” actress “ because I was engaged to her father. ” \n“It’s all in the family!” she added. “I love Lenny; he’s a great guy.” \nKidman and Lenny dated in 2003 , a couple years after her divorce from Tom Cruise, People reports. Rumors about the former couple’s engagement made their way into the celebrity news cycle, as they do, though it was never confirmed. \nKidman did , however, admit in a 2007 Vanity Fair interview that she was secretly engaged at one point, though didn’t reveal the fiancé’s name. The engagement didn’t result in marriage, she said, because “it just wasn’t right. I wasn’t ready. We weren’t ready.” \nOf course, Kidman is now married to country star Keith Urban , but it appears she remains on good terms with her former flame. The three of them even posed for some photos at the CMT Awards in 2013. Kevin Mazur via Getty Images Friendly exes.
