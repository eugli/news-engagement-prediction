He said such acts did not reflect the true nature of a multiracial country such as Malaysia. \"This morning (Sarawak Local Government Minister) Datuk Dr Sim Kui Hian came to me and we discussed the issue which had taken place over the past two days. \"We must stop this. I agree that we cannot confiscate and compound (the traders) but we can (ask them to) do labeling on their items, such as indicating if they are 'halal' or 'non halal',\" he said. Speaking at the Padawan Chinese New Year event held at SJK Chung Hua Baru 10 here, Najib said Malaysia is a multiracial country and thus, there is a need to respect other races. \"I will inform the ministry to stop it,\" he said, referring to the seizures and compounds. Earlier in his speech, Najib said moderation is the key to living peacefully and harmoniously. He said the Barisan Nasional is committed towards continuing its policies of moderation. \"We must reject extremism in our country,\" he stressed. Also present were Sarawak Chief Minister Datuk Amar Abang Johari Abang Openg, Sim and other state ministers.
