Trump and his adviser Stephen K. Bannon use apocalyptic language to exaggerate threats facing the United States; and Yeats’s chilling poem “The Second Coming” (1919) was quoted more in 2016 than in any other year in three decades as commentators — worried about terror attacks, Brexit and the American presidential election — repeatedly invoked its lines: “Things fall apart; the center cannot hold.” In his timely new book, “A World in Disarray,” Richard Haass — president of the Council on Foreign Relations and the senior Middle East adviser to President George H. W. Bush — takes a calm, reasoned look at the world today and America’s foreign policy, but comes to the unsettling conclusion that the global trend is “one of declining order.” Haass writes that “the 21st century will prove extremely difficult to manage, representing as it does a departure from almost four centuries of history — what is normally thought of as the modern era — that came before it.” After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the end of the Cold War, he reminds us, a hopeful new world order did not emerge, as some predicted. Instead, the relative stability of a bipolar world — in which the nuclear-armed United States and the Soviet Union approached each another with wary restraint — gave way to a complicated, multipolar one, subject to the forces of globalization, nuclear proliferation and rapidly changing technology. Recently, the growth of populism and extremism in mature democracies, and authoritarianism in other countries, have contributed to further instability. Among the “worrisome developments” Haass describes are “increased rivalry among several of this era’s major powers, the growing gap between global challenges and responses, the reality of and the potential for conflict in several regions, and political dysfunction and changes going on within many countries, including the United States, that are likely to make it more difficult to design and implement a foreign policy that can help the world contend with all the threats to order.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:34:50.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
