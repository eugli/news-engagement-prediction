Mesut Ozil's form has tailed off in recent weeks \nA defeat in either game will pile more pressure on to Wenger, who is yet to extend his contract past the end of this season and has seen his team suffer back-to-back losses against Watford and Chelsea. \nWenger’s future has become a subject of huge debate, but Arsenal’s players and coaching staff have been left completely in the dark over his intentions or what the club expect to happen. \nOwner Stan Kroenke is desperate for Wenger to stay past this season and has put a two-year extension to his £8million-a-year contract on the table that just needs to be signed. \nBut Wenger wants to judge the mood around Arsenal and be sure that the majority of the fans still want him before committing himself for another two years. \nD espite the inevitable fall-out from the Chelsea defeat, there remains a belief inside the Emirates that the mood could quickly improve if Wenger’s team can put a run of results together and get past Bayern. \nAny slip up against Hull or bad defeat in Germany, however, will see calls for Wenger’s head get louder and debate continue over who should replace him. \nJuventus manager Max Allegri has already made it clear that he would be interested in the Arsenal job, while Borussia Dortmund’s Thomas Tuchel and Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim would also be in the frame if the Gunners were forced into a change. \nWenger is not the only man at Arsenal whose future is in doubt with Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil still yet to sign new contracts with the club. Ozil’s form has dipped over recent weeks and the Germany international’s continued inclusion in Wenger’s starting team has raised questions inside the club. Next Arsenal manager: Twenty potential long-term replacements for Arsene Wenger \nT here is a growing feeling that Ozil keeps his place, no matter of his form, ahead of players who deserve a chance such as Danny Welbeck and Olivier Giroud. Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte dropped Diego Costa for the victory over Leicester City, Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has left out Wayne Rooney and Sergio Aguero has lost his place recently at Manchester City, but Wenger has so far remained loyal to Ozil. \nSpeaking about the Chelsea defeat, Laurent Koscielny hinted that there is a belief that some players are getting special treatment by saying: “I think we played some players in front of others and I think we should have played more as a team and there was space to do so. They hit us on the counter.” \nParis Saint-Germain are the latest club to show an interest in Sanchez, who has cut a deeply frustrated figure at times this season, and is already a target for Juventus, Atletico Madrid and clubs in China. \nArsenal are sweating over the availability of Hector Bellerin to face Hull after he suffered concussion against Chelsea, while Francis Coquelin has been struggling with a hamstring problem but Mohamed Elneny is back from African Nations Cup duty.
