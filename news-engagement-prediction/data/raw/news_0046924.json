Reliable testing is the first step in treating the disease, but the myriad of different tests take time to run and won’t detect infection until the virus has been at work for a few weeks. Researchers from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) have developed a biosensor that might change that. This silicon chip can spot HIV in the body within days of exposure and it’s faster than all previous conclusive tests. \nTo diagnose a viral infection like HIV, a test needs to look for either itself or the antibodies your body makes to fight it. Since antibodies are targeted to a single molecule (called an antigen), they can be effectively filtered out and detected. The problem is that it takes time for your body’s immune response to a virus to build up to detectable levels. Looking for the viruses themselves (via the antigens your body reacts to or the RNA viruses carry) can happen a little sooner. But the tests take longer to process and are more expensive. \nGenerally, the earliest for a definitive diagnosis of HIV infection is a month after exposure. That’s where the new chip from the CSIC comes in. It uses gold nanoparticles to target an antigen on virus particles known as p24. This is one of the main constituents of HIV’s capsid (the outer shell). There are more than 2,000 copies of p24 on every HIV virus, making it an ideal target for detection. \nP24 is the same protein some fourth-generation HIV tests detect, but those still won’t work until a few weeks after infection. The CSIC chip can spot virus particles in the blood a mere seven days after infection at concentrations 100,000 times lower than existing tests. It’s much faster, too. Complex 4th gen immunoassays (usually a type of ELISA test ) can take a few days, but the CSIC chip produces results in four hours and 45 minutes. That’s a record for HIV testing. \nEarly detection is essential to lower mortality rates. With proper treatment, HIV patients may never develop AIDS symptoms as medications continue to improve. The CSIC is currently pursuing FDA approval for the test, which it hopes to have within five years. Part of that process will involve testing with clinical samples from real patients. The team hopes to see the chip used on a global scale to diagnose HIV infection earlier than ever before.
