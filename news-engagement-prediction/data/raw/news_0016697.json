Children are sharing images with virtual strangers online Credit: PA \nMore than half (56%) said they have shared pictures and films on a public social media profile, with nearly a quarter (23%) saying they do not know how to control who can see their social media posts. \nThe findings also show that the central role of video and images in digital culture is putting pressure on children to look good online. \nYoung people take 12 \"selfies\" on average before posting one on a website, the report found - while 43% said that they worry about how attractive they look when they share photos. This fear was more common among girls than boys. \nThe report did find that the internet is being used by young people for positive purposes - around two thirds (67%) said that in the last year they have posted an image or video for a positive reason, such as to support friends, share something interesting or to encourage others. \nWill Gardner, a director of the UK Safer Internet Centre and chief executive of Childnet, said: \"It is fair to say that in 2017 the internet is powered by images and videos. \n\"This can magnify the risks and pressures that young people face, while also offering fun new opportunities for self-expression and creativity.\" \n\"Today's findings remind us that with an ever-changing landscape, it is more important than ever to equip young people with the skills, knowledge, confidence and resilience to communicate using images and videos responsibly and positively.\" \nThe online poll of 1,500 eight to 17-year-olds was commissioned by the UK Safer Internet Centre and carried out by ResearchBods.
