Lee said he realizes a two-state solution is difficult to achieve, but said it is the only way to achieve peace. \nNetanyahu’s official visit is the first to Singapore by an Israeli head of government. Last year, Lee became the first Singaporean Prime Minister to visit Israel. \nNetanyahu referred to Singapore and Israel at the news conference as being “kindred spirits.” Both nations are small, with significant defence and high-tech industries. The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1969, but have ties dating back to 1965, when Israeli military advisers covertly assisted Singapore after its declaration of independence.

It would likely require Israel to give up occupied territory that is strategically and religiously significant.

When US President Donald Trump hosted Netanyahu last week, the American leader signaled a policy shift, saying both a two-state and a single-state solution should be considered. \nNetanyahu departs for Australia on Tuesday. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:13:21.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
