He was 76.

The cause of his death was not revealed, but he had experienced a number of respiratory and cardiac issues in recent years. \nThe Milwaukee native's biggest single was 1981's \"We're in This Love Together\" from the album Breakin' Away . Jarreau was also a vocalist on the all-star 1985 track, \"We Are the World,\" along with Michael Jackson, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder, Willie Nelson, Ray Charles, Bruce Springsteen and many others. \nJarreau is one of the few artists to have won Grammys in three separate categories — jazz, pop and R&B. Time Magazine once called him the \"greatest jazz singer alive.\" \nNews of Jarreau's death came as the Grammy Awards were kicking off in Los Angeles. \nTributes poured in on social media. Director Ava DuVernay tweeted that her mom used to play Jarreau's vinyl and that his voice made her happy. \"We're in this love together.\" Bright words for dark days. Saluting Al Jarreau. Mom played his vinyl. His voice made me happy. At rest now. pic.twitter.com/staFXGBhOD \n— Ava DuVernay (@ava) February 12, 2017 \nActress Octavia Spencer wrote that Jarreau \"had a mellifluous voice. Soothing. Beautiful.\" \nMusic wasn't always Jarreau's focus, however — he didn't even record his first album until he was 35. Born to a minister father and a mother who played the piano in church, Jarreau sang from an early age, but he was also an athlete who earned a master's in vocal rehabilitation and started his career as a counselor in San Francisco, playing jazz on the side. But he couldn't ignore his passion for performance and eventually gave up his first career to do music full time. \nHis final album, My Old Friend: Celebrating George Duke , was released in 2014. \nJarreau is survived by his wife, Susan, and a son, Ryan. In lieu of flowers or gifts, a donation page has been set up for the Wisconsin Foundation for School Music. \nAdditional reporting by Mashable.
