Advertisement \nThe ever-reliable Digital Foundry (Via Eurogamer ) have taken a look at the open world critical darling, and it appears to be – by all accounts – a ‘technical masterpiece’. \nDigital Foundry’s detailed video analysis (which you can watch below) notes that Horizon Zero Dawn was in many ways a major showcase title for the PS4 Pro.
