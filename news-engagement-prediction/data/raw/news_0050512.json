ID name is Loy Li Sean (female). Company name is Cozy Ideas Pte Ltd at Ubi. Our 4-room BTO is at Tenteram Peak. We are first time owners and first time doing renovation. We would like to share our experience to warn other owners of these pitfalls. \nBasically, Cozy Ideas has failed in these two aspects: \n1) ID's service \n2) Workers' workmanship. \nFirstly, on ID's service: \na) Lack of responsibility and ownership - Multiple errors and defects spotted in this renovation. Most of them were highlighted by the owners ourselves. There was no onsite supervision at all (which explains why it was FOC in the quote). We did all of the supervision ourselves. \nID will let their workers OTOT and only communicate with them via phone calls/ messages if owners have any questions/ requests. - \nExamples of errors: Carpenter did 1 x 7ft wardrobe in the wrong configuration (1 x missing shelf, added a 120cm instead of 70cm mirror, and drawer height of 30cm instead of 15cm). Advertisement \nRectification is to cover up 50cm of the mirror with laminate, and recreate another shelf just above the mirror. Rectification is to split the 1 x 30cm drawer into 2 x 15cm drawers. \nID could not be bothered to ensure that her workers delivered according to the drawing. Even when she was there during the carpentry installation, she did not spot the errors. The owners have to live with their mistakes. \nb) Lack of professionalism and unapologetic attitude - ID requested us, the owners, to take one or two day offs to check through the house thoroughly so that we can send the errors in one day rather than on a piece-meal basis so as \"to be fair\" to her workers. \nIf ID has done her due dilligence, is there even a need for us to send those messages every other day? We only have 1 to 2 hours to check the house everyday after work (why was that our job anyway?) Naturally, we can only spot a few errors at one time. Furthermore, we are not trained quality surveyors. - ID also told us that she is just a \"middle man\". - The owners found out that 17 x floor tiles (60cm x 60cm) in the living room were hollow. We discovered this only after all the carpentry is up (wardrobes and shoe cabinet). \nID refused to acknowledge that all 17 tiles were hollow and brought the tilers to negotiate with us. Both tilers and ID claimed that the hollow tiles were normal (by their standards perhaps?). We had to argue and convince them to change the hollow tiles. - I mentioned to ID that \"if only you had reminded us to check for hollow tiles first before carpentry is installed.\" She replied me immediately that \"It is owners' responsibility to check.\" \nYes indeed, we checked all the tiles ourselves. We only needed a reminder from the ID whom we thought we can rely on for good advice. - The process of changing the tiles was a complete disaster. The surrounding good tiles were broken/ chipped in the process. During those two days of changing tiles, the ID did not go onsite at all. \nThe tile sitting directly below the built-in shoe cabinet was hollow, but the ID refused to remove the shoe cabinet to change the tile. Eventually, worker agreed to remove the shoe cabinet and change the hollow tile. The wall behind the shoe cabinet was damaged (as seen from picture) and ID refused to fix or paint the wall before reinstalling the shoe cabinet again. \nTherefore, we the owners had to clean up and touch up the wall ourselves before letting the workers reinstall the shoe cabinet. \nClick on the link below to read full complaint.
