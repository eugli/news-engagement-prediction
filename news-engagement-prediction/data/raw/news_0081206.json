So, more or less, I stayed out of the way and tried not to mess things up with him.” \nAdvertisement   Whatever the formula, it has propelled Sock on a steady climb in his results and his rankings. He has already won two major titles in doubles, the 2014 Wimbledon men’s title with the Canadian Vasek Pospisil and the 2011 United States Open mixed doubles with his fellow American Melanie Oudin. At the Rio Olympics, he captured two medals: a gold in mixed doubles with Bethanie Mattek-Sands and a bronze in men’s doubles with Steve Johnson, both Americans. \nAdvertisement   The focus on both singles and doubles took a toll, however. From Oct. 3 through Nov. 4 last year, he played 33 matches in 33 days, so this year, Sock is scaling back on doubles, playing those draws only occasionally, and not at majors. \nAdvertisement   “His focus and his discipline are his biggest improvements, and that just comes with maturity and experience,” Hahn said. “The mental part of this game is huge, and Jack’s gotten over some hurdles by winning some big matches.” While Sock has had some of his best success on hardcourts, he is seen as an even greater threat on clay — not a big surprise, as his forehand has been compared to that of the nine-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal. Sock had planned to spend nearly two months competing on clay this spring, from Houston to Monte Carlo to Madrid and then the French Open, but those plans changed when he found out that he would be traveling to Australia for the Davis Cup quarterfinals the weekend of April 7-9. \nAdvertisement   It is all part of the territory that Sock has now found himself in as the country’s top-ranked male player. But despite the hand-wringing in the American tennis community over the fact that the nation has not produced a men’s major winner since Andy Roddick won the United States Open in 2003, Sock insists that he feels no pressure. “I’m actually feeling more comfortable on the court now,” Sock said. “I think that’s why I’m playing great tennis this year. I’m trying to win every point, every match, and beat every guy I play. In the past, I would let things get to me and been much more emotional, both positive and negative. Now I feel much more relaxed on the court.” His rising status was manifested in an advertising campaign by his racket company last spring in which Sock launched a bid for the U.S. presidency. He was, the commercial proclaimed, “The leader you didn’t know you needed for the campaign you didn’t know existed.” Sock still chuckles at the memory. He said he did not have time to vote in last year’s election and is not entirely up to speed on national politics, though he would like to be. For now, Sock’s focus is on a different campaign: becoming the best in the tennis world.
