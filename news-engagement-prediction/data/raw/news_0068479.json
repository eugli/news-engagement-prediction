That would probably be my No. 1 priority. The backlog is unfair,\" she said.\n'Clearly a national issue': Manitoba calls for federal support for refugees crossing border\nLamoureux wants MLAs, immigrants and their sponsors to have better access to immigration services, including more open lines of communication with officials with the provincial nominee program.\nShe's optimistic a meeting she'll have with Wishart on Wednesday will lead to changes, but she didn't receive the formal agreement to review the provincial immigration nominee program she had hoped for.\n\"Right now, no one is hearing anything,\" Lamoureux said. \"I'm hoping by noon he'll have something for me, and if not, I am prepared to stay longer.\"\nTks for mtg @Min_Wishart , positive discussions,unfortunately no answers provided.I will be sleeping on the floors, 10hrs & counting #mbpoli pic.twitter.com/EOahbyqtEK\n— @CindyLamoureux", "external_links": ["https://t.co/EOahbyqtEK", "https://twitter.com/Min_Wishart", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/mbpoli?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/CindyLamoureux/status/834551530892070912"], "published": "2017-02-23T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:24:19.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
