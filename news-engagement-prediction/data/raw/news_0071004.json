Rather he spent two nights in hospital following complaints of a severe cough, until he was brought to court for the sentencing on Wednesday. \nHe was found guilty last week by the jury in a 8-1 majority verdict of deliberately concealing his negotiation over a Shenzhen penthouse linked to businessman Bill Wong Cho-bau, when Tsang granted various applications by radio station Wave Media, of which Wong was a shareholder, between 2010 and 2012. \nThe judge said at the time:“ Never in my judicial career have I seen a man fallen from so high .” \nHe said the former city leader had breached the trust placed upon him by the people of Hong Kong and the Beijing government. \nTsang’s family members stepped out of a seven-seater van at the front gate of the Lai Chi Lok Reception Centre at about 2:30pm on Thursday. \nThey proceeded to a registration building, where the sister, Katherine Tsang, carried out necessary paperwork, while Tsang’s wife Selina sat down waiting, switching her glance from time to time between a television playing a prisoner-based drama and the emptiness in the air. \nThey were assisted by the prison guards, and eventually entered the reception centre surrounded by members of the press. \nThey left shortly after 4:15pm with the help of Correctional Service Department officers to push their way through a media pack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:48:35.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
