Political discourse amid ongoing assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh has touched a new low.\nWith three phases to elect 403 MLAs over and four rounds still to go, the lung power of the politicians, cutting across party lines, appears to have overcome propriety.\nChief minister Akhilesh Yadav's jibe on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan for an advertisement campaign on the wild ass from Gujarat has set the tone for an all-out battle of words .\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party, which is desperate to take power in the country's most populous state, was outraged.\nGujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani has asked the Congress, the Samajwadi Party's ally, to apologize for Akhilesh Yadav's statement.\nThe chief minister's aide, Udayveer Singh, defended the statement, saying \"It was only to suggest that in Gujarat even donkeys are glorified.\"\nOn the same day the chief minister went on the offensive, his close aide and Samajwadi Party spokesman Rajendra Chowdhary called BJP President Amit Shah and Modi as \"terrorists of democracy\".\nThis predictably angered the saffron brigade.\nBharatiya Janata Party general secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak alleged that the Samajwadi Party leadership was skirting major issues and indulging in verbal slang .\nStung by the continuous barbs of the Prime Minister on its supremo Mayawati, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has begun to respond.\nTo Modi's jibe in Orai when he called the BSP a 'Behenji Sampatti Party', alluding to allegations of ill-gotten money by the four-time chief minister, the BSP hit back.\nMayawati coined a new acronym for Narendra Damodardas Modi - Negative Dalit Man.\nSimilar slangs have been making rounds at various campaign rallies.\nIn earlier campaign rallies, Modi said that the four letters in the word 'scam' stood for Samajwadi Party (S), Congress (C), Akhilesh (A) and Mayawati (M).\nAzam Khan has in the past called the Prime Minister a demon, a beggar, a terrorist among other things.\nCongress vice president Rahul Gandhi recently told an election rally in Fatehpur that Modi was a 'Gabbar' - the infamous villain of Bollywood hit \"Sholay\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:34:53.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
