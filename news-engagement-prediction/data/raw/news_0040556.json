For years, U.S. and Israeli leaders, as well as most of the international community, have advocated the vision of two nations, one Israeli and one Palestinian, living side by side, as the key to peace. \nA day after an anonymous White House official told reporters that Trump was no longer committed to that approach, the president made it official. \nTrump said he wanted to forge \"a really great peace deal\" and would support whatever solution that Israelis and Palestinians wanted. \n\"I'm looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one both parties like,\" Trump said. \"I can live with either one.\" \nNetanyahu, who has formally supported the two-state solution in the past, dodged the question. \nIsrael’s far right increasingly has pushed the idea of a single Israeli state of both Arabs and Jews, and control of the disputed West Bank, Golan Heights and other areas captured by Israel during the 1967 war. \nPalestinians see much of that land as theirs, and insist on a separate sovereign state.

(Gregg Roman) \nOther critics, including former Secretary of State John F. Kerry, note that Palestinians would soon outnumber Jews in a single-state scenario. They could use the ballot box to take control unless Israel abandons its democracy and restricts their rights the way South Africa once barred blacks from voting under apartheid. \nDuring the campaign, Trump indicated he would be in lockstep with Netanyahu on Israeli policies, and rarely even mentioned the Palestinians. But since his inauguration, the new president has moderated some of his positions. \nTrump was asked Wednesday, for example, about his campaign pledge to relocate the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move considered provocative because both Israel and the Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T06:00:44.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
