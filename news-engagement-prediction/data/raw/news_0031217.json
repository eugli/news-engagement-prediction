Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email On the Corrie cobbles, newcomer Chris Harper plays a cunning ­smooth talker about to tear the life of a young teenage girl apart.\nHandsome tanning salon owner Nathan Curtis will lure unsuspecting schoolgirl Bethany Platt to bed this week – then set about grooming her for sex parties with other perverts.\nBut in reality, Chris is hoping his sinister storyline will help more terrified victims of paedophiles to come forward, the Sunday People can reveal.\nThe 39-year-old actor prepared for the role by meeting abuse survivors through the NSPCC. And the shattering impact their ­stories had on him has only increased his ­determination to play the pervert to perfection.\n“Nothing can desensitise you to what ­survivors of sexual exploitation have gone through. It’s the most important storyline I’ve ever had,” says Chris in our interview on the soap’s set.\nRead More 'How does Shona know Kylie Platt?' Coronation Street viewers confused as she visits murdered character's grave Chris Harper has been advised by real-life victims of abuse for his portrayal of a sexual deviant (Photo: ITV) “It’s massively important I get this right for them. We want to reach out to people to let them know help is out there, and to tell ­abusers they can’t get away with it.\n“Half the problem is getting people to come forward. It’s been said that for every one ­person reporting abuse, another seven don’t.”\nSince his Street debut at Christmas, when he peeled unconscious 16-year-old Bethany (Lucy Fallon) from the cobbles after she’d downed diet pills, predator Nathan has slowly wormed his way into her affections.\nAnd what has chilled viewers is that, unlike the Jimmy Savile or Gary Glitter dirty old man image, Nathan is young, good-looking and, on the surface, very well intentioned.\n“The stereotype is of this older man with a sticky suit, bad hair and bad teeth,” Chris says. “But often the reality is very different. The perpetrators could be any age, any colour or class, and so can the people affected.\nLast week the NSPCC introduced Chris to a child abuse victim, now 20, who has been advising the show’s writers.\nHer attacker was a family man with kids, but police were unable to convict him.\nRead More Coronation Street spoilers: No one is set for a happy Valentine's Day in Weatherfield as there's brawls and rows Chris's character looks nothing like stereotypical beasts like Savile and Glitter (Photo: v) Chris says: “She was just 10 when she was groomed online by a man claiming to be 21. She was very intelligent but vulnerable. Her parents were abusive to each other.\n“She was very lonely so she struck up this friendship. The abuse lasted until she was 16.\n“When police investigated, it was her word against his. Who would believe her against a 30-year-old father?”\nChris met another sex crime victim through Voicing CSA, another charity that helps the abused.\nThis was a vulnerable young woman raped by her own husband – a chilling example of the control attackers ­develop over their victims.\n“They were together 20 years,” Chris says. “He was very successful, and charming, but gradually he stripped away her self-esteem.\n“He removed her money, then her ability to make basic decisions – even picking food from a menu. They slept separately, but he would come into her room, rape her, then tell her how lucky she was to be married to such a successful businessman.”\nThe terrified young wife developed an eating disorder and became hooked on anti-depressants.\nChris says: “It wasn’t until something clicked that she fled. She and her daughter ran away to a hotel while her husband was at work and then the police moved them to a safe house. She’s now an inspiration to so many others.”\nRead More Coronation Street viewers SLAM Helen Flanagan's acting: 'Worst actress on TV' Nathan has carefully wormed his way into Bethany's life (Photo: ITV) Two days before meeting the NSPCC, Chris attended a charity night with co-stars Kym Marsh and Simon Gregson to raise awareness of abuse.\nHe’s also spoken in private to friends in social services and spent hours talking to a police contact who worked closely on the case of 21-year-old pervert Alistair Spagnoletti, who groomed a 17-year-old girl then lured her into having sex with hundreds of other men.\nPolice described it as one of the most ­damaging cases of sexual exploitation they had witnessed. Spagnoletti, of Luton, was one of three men jailed last August.\nChris says: “Police couldn’t get the girl to testify against him because she was so in love. Hearing about these sorts of cases makes you realise how duped and vulnerable some of these people are.”\nHe’s been so moved by his research for the role he’s agreed to be an ambassador for Voicing CSA and will be running the London Marathon for the NSPCC. During our time on set, I bump into Corrie legend and super-villain Pat Phelan, played by Connor McIntyre.\nHis character is so disliked he tells me he was recently sworn at by a bunch of pensioners while on holiday with his partner. “It’s that ****ing Phelan!” they told him.\nBut Nathan is set to raise the hatred bar.\nRead More 'You're every man's dream': Sickening messages sent by dad-of-two to 14-year-old girl via Facebook Coronation Street star Chris told Emma Pryer he hopes the storyline helps victims come forward (Photo: ITV) Chris says: “Phelan is a villain you love to hate, but there is nothing cute or lovable at all about Nathan.\n\"He is a predator – ­malicious and vindictive through and through.\n\"And I knew when I took this part that it had a limited shelf life.\n“Nathan will only stick around as long as he’s getting something out of it.”\nChris’s wife Emily Bowker appears in Call The Midwife on Sunday and recently starred in EastEnders. “She was the HR consultant who got Dot Cotton sacked, so the pair of us are going to be the least popular soap couple,” he says.\nCorrie’s bosses hope that by airing Nathan’s grooming storyline pre-watershed they may reach out to children and vulnerable young people aged up to 18 who could be watching, perhaps with their families.\nThe timing means that none of the scenes are ­sexually explicit.\nOn Friday we’ll see Bethany plied with booze on a night out with Nathan’s pal Mel.\nShe’ll then lure Bethany back to his flat.\nRead More Prolific paedophile admits catalogue of abuse against children in case deemed 'one of the worst heard in court' Lucy Fallon stars as grooming victim Bethany Platt (Photo: ITV) He acts like the perfect gent, offering her a spot on his sofa.\nBut he leaves his bedroom door open, and Bethany goes in to spend the night with him.\nIn coming weeks the conniving sleaze will start taking her to parties full of men.\nViewers will be able to read the warning signs, but not Bethany. “It’s not about showing pornography – it’s about seeing how callously he manipulates her,” insists Chris.\n“He makes none of the first moves. He leaves it for her to do that every time and that is very clever.\n“Because it’s before 9pm there could be teenagers ­watching – young people going through it themselves.\n“We want them to start ­talking about it. That’s one of the biggest messages from the charities. They are pleased that we are raising awareness.\n“Sexual exploitation is ­horrendous, and we need to be doing something about it.”\nTo help Chris raise money for the NSPCC, please donate at justgiving.com/fundraising/ChrisHarperCorrieRun .
