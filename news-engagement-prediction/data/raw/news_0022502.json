There was no violence and no charges were filed.” \nThe El Moussas, who wed in 2009, said they sought counseling to “sort out” the relationship and decided to separate while evaluating “the future of our marriage.” \nAs they continue to co-parent their two children, they also do not want to part ways on filming their hit HGTV show. \nIn late January, a source told PEOPLE that Tarek and Christina “are very much committed and want to continue to work together and continue the show.” Show Full Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:31:33.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
