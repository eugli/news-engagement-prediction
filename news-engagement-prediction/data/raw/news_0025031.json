Sanders will set \"Glengarry\" on the cusp of the 2007 housing market crash.\nThe cast includes a diverse group of women in the lead roles. A white male student will play Baylen, the role of the police detective, and James Lingk will be played by a Latino male student.\nMamet confirmed to the Tribune that he approved the casting.\nIn another departure from the \"Glengarry\" of yesterday, Sanders will also use a Greek chorus to represent a board of directors of the real estate company — made up of all white male students. They will not speak but instead serve as a looming reminder of who has power and which fates are pre-determined.\n\"It's serendipitous that this happened with all the stuff that's going on with Trump,\" said Sanders, who's had the production in mind for years. \"I think it speaks more to the political climate of our society now than when the show came out.\"\nHe says he's interested in exploring how women navigate male-dominated spaces.\n\"It’s not a woman’s world but it is a women’s office,\" says Sanders.\nThe production runs Feb. 17-26 at the UIC Theatre, 1044 W.
