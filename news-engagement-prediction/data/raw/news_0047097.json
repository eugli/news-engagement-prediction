And have come together to vote. Our condition is superb. We will win; there is no reason for us to not win,” she said.

The chief minister said he wished that all SP candidates won the polls. \nBSP chief Mayawati and Union home minister Rajnath Singh, along with his family, cast their votes in Lucknow.

The seats contain the ruling family’s strongholds — their home districts of Etawah and Mainpuri — and state capital Lucknow. \nThe voters sealed the fate of several heavyweights, including that of Shivpal, Aparna, Mulayam’s nephew Anurag, Akhilesh aide Anurag Singh, BJP’s Rita Bahuguna Joshi, SP ministers Nitin Agarwal and Abhishek Mishra and BSP’s Nakul Dubey. \nAfter Sunday’s voting 194 assembly segments in 37 districts will be left for polling in the remaining four phases. India’s most populous state has 75 districts. \n(With agency inputs) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:46:29.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
