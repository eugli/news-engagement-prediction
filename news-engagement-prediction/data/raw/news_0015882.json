Shortly after they moved into the White House in 2009, Barack and Michelle Obama were faced with a very quotidian dilemma: finding the right baby gifts. Not content to send an aide to the Baby Gap or order a bassinet on Amazon, the First Couple instead turned to Florence Eiseman, the Milwaukee-based children’s clothing company that, for eight years, made custom baby clothes that the Obamas gifted to some of the most prominent newborns in the country. It began with a personal connection: the president’s assistant, Katie Johnson, went to Wellesley College with Florence Eiseman president Frank Botto’s daughter, Dr. Nina Botto. “I said, ‘Katie, don’t call anybody else. I’ll take care of this for you,’” Frank Botto recalled in a recent phone call to with Vanity Fair . Florence Eiseman’s vice president and head of design, Teri Shapiro Larson, then took over, sketching several designs as she figured out “how to make it special, how to identify it as presidential.” Johnson and Michelle Obama made the final choice; “I’m not quite sure how [much] President Obama was involved,” Larson admitted. The end results—a blue ottoman train-accented “shortall” and shirt for boys, and a pink-and-white ottoman dress with a flower appliqué waistband for girls—were then given a final, custom touch. The presidential seal, along with the Obamas’ signatures and the children’s names and birth dates, were discreetly embroidered into the garments. \nThe Obamas’ baby gifts. Courtesy of Florence Eiseman. Monogramming the children’s names and dates of birth on the Obamas’ baby gifts was Larson’s idea. And she personally spent an hour or two stitching every one of them, depending on the child’s name—which could be tricky for another reason. After Larson had to redo an order because she mistakenly assumed she’d been given a boy’s name, she asked the White House to start specifying the baby’s sex. Fewer than 100 high-profile moms and dads received these special mementos. Though Obama staffers won’t reveal the names of the recipients to protect the children’s privacy, think of the A-list singers, directors, models, and Silicon Valley and Wall Street executives who had babies during the Obama administration. ( Beyoncé’s forthcoming twins, sadly, will have to settle for clothes without the presidential seal.) So impressive were the clothes that after seeing a dress on Johnson’s desk, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked if she, too, could use the company for gifts. Her request was denied. While Larson won’t divulge the cost of the outfits, which the Obamas personally paid for, she says similar Eiseman styles go for $110-$120, though that doesn’t factor in the custom presidential embroidery. In 2016, the city of Milwaukee won a challenge to enroll the most people in the Affordable Care Act, and earned a visit from the president. Larson and her husband took the opportunity to meet and have their picture taken with the president; she said he told her the clothes were gorgeous, and everyone loved them. Proud as the entire company has been to make the outfits for the Obamas, everyone somehow managed to keep mum about its secret service for eight years. Botto attributes this to having a close-knit group of employees. Now that the company's prestigious gig for the Obamas has come to an end, would the company consider making similar gifts for the Trump administration if asked? Botto, a Democrat, says he hasn’t thought about it, and would have to confer with Larson. Larson is a bit more resolute: “I don’t think our taste levels jibe,” she said. “[It] wouldn’t be a good match in many ways.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:46:22.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
