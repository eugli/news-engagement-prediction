I don't see him as a player who will accept that. He will want to be at a team where he's playing every week. Rooney and Scholes together in 2010 Credit: GETTY IMAGES \n\"No one will be more frustrated than Wayne at not playing. Being a sub will be driving him up the wall. \n\"It will be killing him just coming in for the Europa League or the FA Cup. But it's up to him to get his head down and prove he can play in the big games.\" Man Utd team picker \nR ooney and his team-mates sit sixth in the Premier League with 13 games left to play, but Scholes has backed manager Jose Mourinho to lead the club to a top-four finish. \n\"It's been a massive improvement from what we've seen in the last couple of years,\" the former England midfielder said about Mourinho's reign. \n\"I watch them now and have no doubt they'll finish in the top four. They're playing the best out of the top six with Chelsea and you have to fancy them to finish second or third.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:12:06.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
