After an informal conversation, I misunderstood that Ms. Streep may have chosen another designer due to remuneration, which Ms. Streep’s team has confirmed is not the case. I regret this controversy and wish Ms. Streep well with her 20th Academy Award nomination.”\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Shots fired!\nNow, Streep is defending herself against the claim in People :\nIn reference to Mr. Lagerfeld’s ‘statement,’ there is no ‘controversy’: Karl Lagerfeld, a prominent designer, defamed me, my stylist, and the illustrious designer whose dress I chose to wear, in an important industry publication. That publication printed this defamation, unchecked. Subsequently, the story was picked up globally, and continues, globally, to overwhelm my appearance at the Oscars, on the occasion of my record breaking 20th nomination, and to eclipse this honor in the eyes of the media, my colleagues and the audience. I do not take this lightly, and Mr. Lagerfeld’s generic ‘statement’ of regret for this ‘controversy’ was not an apology. He lied, they printed the lie, and I am still waiting. Shots fired back!\nI wonder if Karl will be at the show tonight, and if so, if he'll piss his couture when Meryl makes her move on him? I'd run.\nFollow Laura on Twitter .\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below", "external_links": ["http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/streep-fires-back-at-lagerfeld-wwd-10820959/", "http://twitter.com/mrpenguino", "http://people.com/style/oscars-2017-meryl-streep-karl-lagerfeld-chanel-response/amp/"], "published": "2017-02-26T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:19:31.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
