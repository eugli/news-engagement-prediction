NBC Saturday Night Live \nDonald Trump’s top press man Sean Spicer slammed comedy show Saturday Night Live as \"crossing over to mean” after he was parodied in a comedy sketch. \nMillions of viewers watched actress Melissa McCarthy poke fun at press secretary Mr Spicer in a skit which many have called “hilarious”. \nIn a send-up of Mr Spicer’s use of “alternative facts”, the Saturday Night Live clip sees Bridesmaids star Ms McCarthy impersonate the aide and make exaggerated claims about the President’s popularity. \nBut the Trump sidekick hit out at the show saying it used to be funny but has “crossed over to mean” – in particular since the start of Alec Baldwin’s sketches impersonating Donald Trump. \nMr Spicer told news outlet Extra: “Alec has gone from funny to mean and that's unfortunate. \"SNL\" used to be really funny. There's a streak of meanness now that they've crossed over to mean.” \nThe press adviser, who first heard about the parody as he left church on Sunday morning, said he felt the impression was a exaggerated and said Ms McCarthy “needs to slow down on the gum-chewing; way too many pieces in there”. \nHe added the comedy actress “could dial back” a bit. Alec Baldwin mocks Donald Trump as he leads New York protest \nMs McCarthy began the impersonation saying: “Before we begin, I know the press and myself have gotten off to a rocky start. \n“When I say rocky I mean in the sense of ‘Rocky’ the movie because I came out here to punch you in the face, and also I don't talk so good.” \nShe then parodied Mr Spicer’s claims over the size of President Trump’s inauguration crowd, by describing how the US leader received a “standing ovation” and “everyone was happy”. \nLast month Donald Trump blasted the NBC show’s parody of his first news conference as President-elect , calling Hollywood star Alec Baldwin’s impersonation “really bad television”.
