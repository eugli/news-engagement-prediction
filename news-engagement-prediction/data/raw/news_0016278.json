KERRI'S MESSAGE IN FULL 'Behind each ectopic pregnancy is a woman with a story to tell. This is my story. My name is Kerri. In November 2015 we found out we were pregnant - we were ecstatic. We started planning and preparing for our expanding family. December 9, 2015... I started bleeding. I thought it was a miscarriage. December 11... I had a scan and was told it was possibly 'ectopic'. I was admitted, not knowing exactly what it was. I collapsed and was rushed to theatre. They saved my life. Our baby died. I nearly died. This is all we have left [Kerry holds up a baby scan image] I felt numb. I healed physically from open surgery and the grief hit - Guilt, jealousy, anger, sadness, lonely, helpless, empty. There was nowhere to go for support. Just like there is no awareness. In memory of our baby, we want to change that. An ectopic pregnancy is a life-threatening condition. It is the leading cause of death in early pregnancy. One in 80 pregnancies are ectopic.
