Woman killed when driver swerves to avoid car parked on shoulder of I-170 10 hrs ago ( … ) \nFriends on a fundraising site posted this photo of Dana Ridley (left) and her husband, Charles Ridley. \nST. LOUIS COUNTY • A woman was killed Wednesday night when the car she was riding in swerved to avoid a vehicle parked on the shoulder of Interstate 170. \nThe victim is identified as Dana M. Ridley, 38, of the St. Louis area. \nThe Missouri Highway Patrol said Ridley was fatally injured in a crash just after 10 p.m. Wednesday on southbound I-170 at St. Charles Rock Road. \nThe patrol said Ridley was a passenger in a 2003 Mercury Sable driven by her husband, Charles W. Ridley, 40. Charles Ridley was driving south on the Innerbelt, just north of St. Charles Rock Road, when he swerved to the left to avoid hitting a car parked on the right shoulder. \nCharles Ridley lost control of the car and ran off the road to the left. The car struck a guardrail and overturned. Dana Ridley was ejected from the car. Neither she nor Charles Ridley were wearing a seat belt, the patrol said. \nRescuers with the Community Fire District pronounced Dana Ridley dead at 10:28 p.m. Charles Ridley suffered serious injuries and was taken to Mercy Hospital St. Louis in Creve Coeur. \nFriends of the Ridleys have set up a GoFundMe account to raise money for Dana Ridley's funeral expenses and Charles Ridley's hospital expenses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:40:59.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
