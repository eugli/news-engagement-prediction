(Rich Fury/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  30 PM \nThe outpouring of emotion that followed the death of “Brady Bunch” matriarch Florence Henderson last November was overwhelming, says her TV daughter Maureen McCormick - but not surprising. \n“It was amazing,\" said McCormick, who played eldest daughter Marcia on the 70s hit. “I think everyone was so amazed at the outpouring and I get it everywhere I go.” \n“She was genuinely really loved and admired and respected and I think she brought a lot of happiness to a lot of people and she wanted to do that.\" \nMcCormick spoke at the American Heart Association's Go Red For Women fashion show at the Hammerstein Ballroom Thursday, where she appeared as one of the celebrity carpet walkers as a tribute to Henderson, who died of heart failure and had a long history of heart trouble. Henderson herself walked in the Red Dress fashion show in 2016. In memoriam: Remembering the famous figures we lost in 2016 \n“I feel like Florence is here in spirit,” said McCormick, who saw Henderson just days before she died, when her onetime TV mom showed up to cheer McCormick on as she competed in a taping of “Dancing with the Stars.” \nSuch support was typical, and went back to their earliest days, when Henderson made McCormick and her TV siblings feel like family off set as well as on it. \n“We were on a show where she was our mother and she brought us into her real world and let us be with her on weekends,” recalled McCormick. “She would bring me to New York to spend Christmas with her family.” McCormick (top left) and Henderson (top center) during the show's early 70s heyday.

It's a hard thing to be the child of a woman who's known as America's mother, but they came to such a great peace with it knowing that their mother was really here to spread love so they welcomingly learned to share her with the world.” \nFlorence Henderson battled heart disease years before her death \nNeedless to say, McCormick is constantly told by men that she was their first crush, and considers it “a nice compliment.” But such men don't include her husband - who'd never seen the show when they met. \n“Thank god I found him,” she says. “He loved me for me because all this, it comes and goes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:06:13.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
