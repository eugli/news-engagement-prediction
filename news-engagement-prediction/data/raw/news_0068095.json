What did protests achieve? James Cook, BBC North America correspondent \nThe battle of Standing Rock has been bitter to the end. Barring an eleventh hour twist, the protestors - who call themselves water protectors - have lost their fight. \nSmaller camps may remain but the oil looks certain to flow, perhaps as soon as a fortnight from now. However some demonstrators say they have succeeded in pricking the nation's conscience on two fronts. \nFirst, by highlighting the abiding resentment of many Native Americans at the pillage of their land by the white man. And secondly, by showcasing the ultimate unsustainability of an economic system built on a thirst for oil. \nEven if that is true, it has come at a cost. \nScores of people were injured; the state of North Dakota must pay a bill running into millions of dollars; and hundreds of protesters face criminal charges, some with the potential of lengthy jail terms. \nNot only that but the protests have split the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters - as well as underlining, yet again, deep divisions in the wider United States. Image copyright AP Image caption There were emotional scenes as people left the camp \nEarlier on Wednesday, about 150 people departed the camp for the last time as a deadline to leave the area approached. \nUp to 75 people remained outside the camp and at least nine people were taken into custody for failing to leave, authorities said. \nLt Tom Iverson said police would not enter the camp on Wednesday night. \nAt its peak in the autumn, the protest camp had thousands of people, but that has fallen to a couple of hundred in the last few weeks.
