It also claimed maintenance teams will ensure accessible toilets are more reliable and fixed faster when problems arise.\n\"I take the issue of accessibility on our railways extremely seriously and these commitments from industry are just one step forward to improve things.\n\"It is vital that all people, including disabled passengers, are able to use public transport and I will continue to push train companies on this matter.\"\n– Paul Maynard, Rail Minister It has been a requirement since 1999 that all new trains with toilets are built with accessible toilets as standard, with older trains complying by 2020.\nThe DfT said 150 stations have been upgraded under the Access for All programme to remove barriers to independent travel, including installing signs, ramps and lifts.\nA further 68 are in construction or development.\nAn Accessibility Action Plan will be published by the DfT later this year to address the issue across all modes of public transport\nLast updated Wed 1 Feb 2017 Travel Harlow Essex", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T09:22:22.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
