It was the first win for the T3 model. \nOne month later, Reutemann again took pole with chassis No. 032 at the prestigious Monaco GP. \nThe car has been through various car collections since, and has been seen quite often in recent years as a regular at the Monaco Historique event.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:49:30.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
