(Getty Images) \nChelsea are looking to beat AC Milan to the £21 million signing of Villarreal centre-back Mateo Musacchio, according to reports. \nThe Daily Mirror claims that the Premier League leaders want to submit their own offer for the 26-year-old, despite the Argentine being close to agreeing a move to the Serie A side. \nThe report claims that Musacchio, who has been capped four times by Argentina, has a release clause in his contract. \nAntonio Conte is believed to be in the market for a new central defender this summer, with Leonardo Bonucci heavily linked with a move to Stamford Bridge. Musacchio has been a key figure in Villarreal’s defence this season.
