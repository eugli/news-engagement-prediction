T+L Newsletters \nHaving a horse whisperer as an owner comes with perks. \nNext time you're due for a family reunion, take inspiration from Albert and Ernie, two Shetland ponies from the U.K. who took a trip to meet their relatives in style. \nNot only did the petite ponies travel from their home in Devon, southwest England, to Scotland's Shetland Islands on a small boat, but they dressed up in matching Shetland knitwear upon arrival. \nSailor ponies in sweaters. Take a minute to let that sink in. \n© Malcolm Snelgrove & Emma Massingale \nNow, there was a human behind this epic month-long adventure, but not just any ordinary human, of course. Albert and Ernie's owner is Emma Massingale, one of England's top horse trainers, according to MailOnline , who claims to have developed a language that allows her to \"communicate with herds of horses.” (She got the matching sweater memo as well, obviously.) \n© Malcolm Snelgrove & Emma Massingale \nTraveling the rough waters around Shetland, through high winds and pods of orcas, in a tiny motor boat with two ponies is no easy feat, but Massingale is an avid adventurer and after a trial run on a local lake, she decided Albert and Ernie were ready to trace their roots and get a firsthand look at how their peers live in the wild. Ernie is said to be related to one of the islands' first Shetland ponies. \n© Malcolm Snelgrove & Emma Massingale \nCoordinated fashion aside, the ponies were able to get in touch with their wild sides, running free among the herds while Massingale camped out nearby and made stops to learn more about her pets' history, including a visit to the Shetland Pony Society. The ponies even tried out carrying the baskets their ancestors used to transport soil and seaweed around the island. \n© Malcolm Snelgrove & Emma Massingale \nMaybe next they'll take their sweaters on the road to meet their like-minded, fashion-forward elephant friends in India? Either way, it seems safe to neigh—umm, say—this was one trip Albert and Ernie will never forget. \n© Malcolm Snelgrove & Emma Massingale ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:47:41.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
