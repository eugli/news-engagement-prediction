The Raiders’ salary cap squeeze hasn’t been helped by last year’s charge up the ladder.\nStuart said he wasn’t being critical of the NRL but admitted these decisions were tough for players and fans to digest.\n“It is the hardest thing I have had to do as coach of the Raiders, sitting both these men down and having to talk to them about their futures,” Stuart said.\n“I have felt uncomfortable about it for many months and I still don’t feel comfortable today because they are two mates.\n“And I can tell you it is something the players here struggle to understand also, especially when you are building a culture at a club.\n“The players don’t want to lose their mates, and neither do the fans. I totally understand that because that is exactly how I feel. But it is the reality of the salary cap as it is.”\nStuart isn’t the first to question the current system.

I understand this is a difficult situation for every club. But I just wonder if we can come up with a better system. I just feel for the players, and the fans.”\nStuart said Fensom and Lee would leave with the club’s best wishes after giving outstanding service and loyalty.\n“The door will always be open for them here,” Stuart said. “And I know the clubs who get these players are getting good players and good men.”\nOriginally published as Stuart left looking for answers after exits", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:49:21.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
