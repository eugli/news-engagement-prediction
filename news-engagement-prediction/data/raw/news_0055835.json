Feehan has rejected the introduction of promotion and relegation, with the bottom club of the Six Nations facing a play-off against the winners of the Rugby Europe Championship. Feehan vehemently rejected a renewed debate fuelled in part by Italy's catastrophic 63-10 home defeat against Ireland on February 11. 'You wait for the weakest animal to fall and you are on top of them,' he said, referring to critics clamouring for an overhaul of the event. There have been calls for Georgia to be allowed into the annual competition 'Are we closed to every scenario? No, but it takes a while to see a convincing argument — 10 or 15 years. We have to take a good, considered view about what is right for our six unions. They would all have to agree that this is what they want. At this stage, talk of bringing in other teams is premature.' The Six Nations' reluctance to consider opening up to other countries is utterly at odds with World Rugby's expansionism, but Feehan is adamant that the global governing body cannot meddle in the running of the championship. 'World Rugby have no input into this tournament,' he said. 'They have no control over it, no ownership of it. It's not theirs to tell us what to do with it. 'It is World Rugby's job to develop the game. Our job is to run the Six Nations as we see fit. Do the unions have a responsibility to help develop and expand the game? Probably, yes, but should that go as far as messing with the most important tournament? Probably not. Our primary role is not to develop other unions but if we can help, we do.' Georgia's Kiwi head coach, Milton Haig, has urged Feehan to visit Tbilisi and outline what the 'Lelos' need to do to be in the Six Nations. Georgia head coach Milton Haig has urged the authorities to visit Tbilisi Feehan's entrenched attitude has led Octavian Morariu, head of Rugby Europe, to call him 'arrogant'. 'The Six Nations could support European rugby more, but they don't,' said Morariu. 'Staying in a rich old-boys' club is not the answer. It's a very arrogant answer. Saying, 'We are rich, thank you very much and we don't need you' is not consistent with the values of our sport. 'When someone like Sir Clive Woodward says it is time to change, people listen. There is support for change within the Six Nations. Two or three years ago, these discussions would have been impossible. Only a few people within the Six Nations would have listened to me, but now there are a lot of people listening.' Morariu recognises that neither Rugby Europe nor World Rugby can directly force the Six Nations to reform. The will must come from within, by recognising the bigger picture. His hope is that ongoing, informal talks will eventually force a breakthrough. 'I'm completely aware that the Six Nations is a commercial company, so we can't interfere in their business,' he said. 'But if we really want to develop European rugby, it won't be developed by the current system. The Six Nations totally dominates the European market. Development is practically impossible in the Six Nations' huge shadow. Octavian Morariu, head of Rugby Europe, says the Six Nations should support European rugby 'After this season, they don't have a sponsor. Big companies look for the big markets. Europe is a very big market. The population of countries within Rugby Europe is 512 million people, but the Six Nations makes up only a third of it. We are not maximising the market.' At a Rugby Europe board meeting in Paris on March 9, there will be a fresh, official request for structural change. Meanwhile, World Rugby continue to observe the impasse and gently encourage progressive thinking, without having the power to enforce reform — to ensure a meritocracy. Chairman Bill Beaumont told Sportsmail : 'What we have to do at World Rugby is enhance the fixtures for a team like Georgia, as a reward for their progress. But tournaments are owned by the countries involved. The only properties World Rugby have are the World Cup, the Under 20s championship every year, and the world Sevens series. 'We are helping Georgia as much as we can and they are hosting the world Under 20 championship this year. We want to grow the game, so it can be enjoyed by more countries than the historical unions who have always played it. But to tell the Six Nations or SANZAR who should be part of their competitions is nigh-on impossible.'
