The requirement rises to £22,400 if there is also one child born outside Europe in the family. The past and future income of the non-British spouse or partner does not count towards the threshold.\n'I should be able to live with my wife': families divided by UK visa rules Read more \nThe JCWI says the policy has already meant two years of heartbreak for Debra, a British woman, and her family. Debra lives in Croydon and has three children – two older children by her previous partner, and a two-year-old daughter by her partner, a qualified Nigerian engineer. The family were separated for more than two years because of the threshold until her partner was recently granted three years’ leave to remain in Britain.\nThe ruling follows a three-day hearing a year ago in which seven supreme court justices, including the deputy president, Lady Hale, heard claims that the “irrational and absurd” minimum income requirement was forcing British families to make a choice of exile or separation.\nThe ruling will cover several linked cases testing the legality of the family visa rules. Two of them, Abdul Majid and Shabana Javed, involve British nationals married to Pakistanis; a third, known as MM, is a Lebanese refugee. A nephew of MM, known as AF, is also an appellant, as well as SS, a refugee from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nAt an earlier hearing the high court ruled the minimum income requirement was “disproportionate and unlawful” and suggested a less intrusive policy option would be to reduce the threshold to the level of the then national minimum wage of £13,500 and allow savings up to £16,000 to supplement the income. However, this ruling was overturned by the court of appeal. \nIn the court of appeal, Lord Justice Maurice Kay ruled the policy was not “discriminatory, manifestly unjust, made in bad faith”, nor was it in breach of article 8 of the European convention on human rights that guarantees a right to family life. The appeal court judge also said the 1971 Immigration Act does not grant a “constitutional right” for British citizens to live in the UK with a non-EEA spouse who has not been granted the right to live in the UK in their own right.\nThe children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, has criticised the threshold for particularly penalising British citizens who have lived and worked abroad and formed long-term relationships there. She said it was leaving British children able to communicate with only one parent via Skype.\nSaira Grant, the JCWI chief executive, said: “Tens of thousands of British people have been told by the government that they are too poor to have their partner, and in many cases the parent of their children, spend their lives together with them in the UK. \n“Families are an easy target in the government’s relentless efforts to lower immigration – they do not have the loud voice of business or industry to plead their case. British citizens are faced with separation from their chosen partner/child or effective exile from their own country,” she said.\n“Children are growing up in one-parent families despite having two parents and are suffering high levels of stress which is impacting on their emotional and mental wellbeing, their attainment in school and ultimately is significantly detrimental to their developmental trajectory. The suffering inflicted on innocent, mainly British children who have the misfortune to have one parent from a country outside the EU shows that for this government no price is too high if it lowers immigration,” Grant added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:46:23.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
