No--that is an understatement--Reese Witherspoon is having a great time in New Zealand. Over the past week, the actress has filled our Instagram feeds with envy-inducing pics her current trip. First, it was the stunning mountain views and water vistas. In one such shot, Witherspoon and friend Mindy Kaling are seen literally jumping for joy. Witherspoon captioned the image, \"Couldn't be more excited to discover #NewZealand with this lady!!!\" Same, but then again we aren't all BFFs with Mindy Kaling. Then, this weekend, it was a shot of herself sipping wine at a vineyard. The image was cheerfully captioned, \"Happy Sunday! [S]oaking up the sun in gorgeous #newzealand. Hope you are having a beautiful day!\" Ok, so by that point we had gotten the message. Reese has been having a fabulous time, and we are all extremely jealous. But the actress is not actually on vacation, as one might easily assume. She is instead on what could be described as the best work trip ever. Witherspoon is in the land of the Kiwis for her upcoming movie A Wrinkle in Time . The film is an adaptation of Madeleine L'Engle's beloved 1962 book, and is being directed by acclaimed director Ava DuVernay. Kaling is one of Witherspoon's costars, as is Oprah, who also appears to be along for the ride. And while the idea of these four incredible women gallivanting around New Zealand while collaborating on this project does nothing to stymie our jealousy pangs, it does make us appreciate that Witherspoon certainly knows how to make the most out of a business trip. After all, when was the last time you casually made time for a yoga retreat with friends while taking a deposition in Des Moines? The answer is likely never. Fair enough, but perhaps we could all benefit from learning a thing or two from Witherspoon when it comes to this department of work-life-balance. As the saying goes, let a girl live.
