The group was in full view of guests at the Mar-a-Lago. Many took photos that later appeared on social media. As CNN reported, waiters “cleared the wedge salads and brought along the main course as Trump and Abe continued consulting with aides.” \nOne guest, Richard DeAgazio, took photos of the scene and posted them on Facebook . The post have since been removed from DeAgazio's account, but screenshots of the post remain on social media. 200K to Mar-a-Lago basically buys you a seat in the Situation Room https://t.co/5t55wN4QeW pic.twitter.com/tdNltbbirM — Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) February 13, 2017 DeAgazio also posed with the U.S. Marine tasked with carrying Trump's \"nuclear suitcase.\" The so-called \"nuclear football\" has followed around every president since John F. Kennedy and enables the president to launch a nuclear attack from outside the White House. It also allows the president to communicate with the National Military Command Center in the Pentagon and contains the nuclear codes needed to launch a nuclear attack anywhere in the world.

The aide in charge of the nuclear briefcase was separated from President Ronald Reagan for several hours during an assassination attempt in 1981. Regan's nuclear codes were later found in a hospital plastic bag. \nBut merely identifying the briefcase or the officer tasked with guarding it is not a risk in itself. The nuclear briefcase has been photographed many times. \nJohn Noonan, a Minuteman III nuclear launch officer under former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama , posted a photo from Reagan's state visit to the Soviet Union in 1988, where you can plainly see the officer holding the nuclear briefcase on the Red Square in Moscow.
