This somehow turned into an argument about turning down an invitation to “have a seat at the table” with Trump, with Sanders saying she would decline to ever go to a Trump White House. \nDennard chastised Sanders, telling her “that’s your problem” and invoking Congressman John Lewis for saying he’d refuse to invite Trump to Selma. Sanders countered by yelling that she she doesn’t need to go anywhere and “I don’t need Donald Trump to give me anything.” \nShe added, “I’m gonna take a page out of Kanye West’s book — Donald Trump doesn’t care about black people.” \n“It’s unfortunate for you and the listeners to hear that about the President of the United States,” Dennard responded. \nCheck out the clip above to see Dyson get involved as well. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T11:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:59:50.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
