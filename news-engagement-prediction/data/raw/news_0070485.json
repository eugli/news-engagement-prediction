The Stark sisters on Game of Thrones have developed a sisterhood bond IRL over the years, and in the process, have been giving us serious friendship goals to aspire to. They&apos;ve had each other&apos;s back on the red carpet (literally), had major twinning moments , dished on each other&apos;s most embarrassing moments , and even gotten matching tattoos (the adult, and more permanent, equivalent of a friendship bracelet). So naturally, when Sophie turned 21 on February 21, Maisie honored her best friend&apos;s golden birthday in the sweetest possible way: with a seriously adorable—but also hilarious—throwback photo of the pair.\nMaisie took to Twitter to send Sophie the happy birthday message. She posted an undated photo of herself when she was much younger (and more petite), gazing up in what appears to be adoration at a much taller Sophie. \"Happy 21st Birthday @SophieT,\" Maisie captioned the cute shot. \"Forever looking up to you, in more ways than one.\" Can you even handle it?!\nhttps://twitter.com/Maisie_Williams/status/834172610292260864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\nBut if you thought Maisie&apos;s birthday message was goals, just wait until you see birthday girl Sophie&apos;s response to her BFF. \"Nah. Lookin&apos; up to you kid,\" Sophie tweeted back. \"Love you.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/SophieT/status/834218425983582208\nMophie forever.\nRelated: BFF Dream Team Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner Just Took a Big Step in Their Relationship", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Maisie_Williams/status/834172610292260864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/SophieT/status/834218425983582208"], "published": "2017-02-22T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:07:57.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
