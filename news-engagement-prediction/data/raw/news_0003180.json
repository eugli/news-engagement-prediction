Jessica Valenti cheers retailers for dropping Ivanka Trump’s line Posted at 1:08 pm on February 3, 2017 by Sam J. \nWow. Nothing says girl power and unity like cheering from the sidelines because a woman you disagree with politically may be facing hard times in her line of work. \nReal classy, Jessica. First Nordstrom, now Neiman Marcus. Keep it up – don't let them make money off their bigotry https://t.co/oJfQ2IIwhZ \n— Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) February 3, 2017 \nSince when was selling dresses, shoes and accessories at various retailers bigotry? *eye roll* @JessicaValenti @Racked Bigotry: intolerance toward those who hold different opinions. Yep. Nordstrom is the bigot. \n— Ben Knapp (@BenKnappDC)   \nD’oh! @JessicaValenti @Racked U ppl are so out of ur minds it's beyond belief. Lol Ppl can buy her clothes here https://t.co/0dylwYw1WH \n— ARION (@OneAndOnlyArion) February 3, 2017 \nThey are absolutely out of their minds as evidenced in this tweet from Valenti alone. A so-called feminist wishing another woman to fail? Third-wave feminism is a mental disorder. @JessicaValenti @Racked How is making money off a name \"making money off their bigotry\"? Ivanka's never said anything bigoted anyway. \n— Russian Blue (@TrueRussianBlue) February 3, 2017 \nS ! You’re hurting her narrative. Facts are oppressive and stuff. @JessicaValenti @Racked How does this affect you personally? Were you buying tons of Ivanka clothing before? \nNot likely but like others on the Left she takes everything personally. \nIt is so boring, right?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T20:19:12.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
