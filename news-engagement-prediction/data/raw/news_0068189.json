Eric Greitens wants to use the proceeds from a recent lawsuit to reduce cuts he was planning to make in next year’s budget. \nIn a statement issued Thursday, the Republican chief executive said a recent Missouri Supreme Court decision that will mean an estimated $50 million in additional revenue will be used to stave off planned reductions to a program serving 15,000 elderly and disabled people who receive in-home care. \nHe also will use some of the proceeds to restore money for school busing costs that he had planned to cut. \n“This money makes our budget situation a bit better. It helps; it doesn’t make us whole,” Greitens said in a prepared statement. \nThe political newcomer could have used the money to restore cuts he and former Gov. Jay Nixon made in the current state budget. Instead, Greitens is putting the money toward the budget that begins on July 1. \n“In our original budget, because of the shortfall, one of the tough choices we made was to change eligibility standards for the home and community-based services program. Making that change helped us protect the most vulnerable people in Missouri,” the governor said. \nThe source of the cash is the apparent end of a long-running lawsuit involving the state and the 1998 settlement with major tobacco companies. \nAlthough Missouri typically receives about $130 million annually, a special panel decided the state in 2003 didn’t properly enforce part of the settlement requiring smaller tobacco companies that didn’t sign the 1998 agreement to pay into an escrow account. \nThe high court’s 4-0 decision allows Missouri to recoup the estimated $50 million that was withheld from its 2003 payment. \nMinutes before Greitens' announcement, Senate budget chair Dan Brown, R-Rolla, cautioned lawmakers from acting too quickly on money from the recent settlements. \n\"The governor may have a way he wants to go, we may have some ways we want to look at it,\" Brown told reporters on Thursday. \"The tobacco money, we still run the risk of a federal district judge tying that money up. So I would be slow to book that money until we know for sure we're going to get it.\" \nHe also warned against using all the money on areas of the budget that require continual funding - suggesting spending half of it on one-time projects and half on higher education, which took the brunt of the cuts under Greitens' $27.6 billion spending proposal. \n\"If revenues don't pick up, and we don't have that money next year, we're right back in the same spot,\" Brown said. \nThe chairman of the House budget committee, Rep. Scott Fitzpatrick, R-Shell Knob, agreed. \n\"It is one-time money. If we put it back, we're going to be faced with the same problem next year,\" Fitzpatrick said. \nThe announcement came two days after Democratic Sen. Jason Holsman of Kansas City urged Greitens to use the money to avoid cuts to the in-home care program, saying its participants are among the most vulnerable in the state. \n​ Kurt Erickson • 573-556-6181", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T16:46:23.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
