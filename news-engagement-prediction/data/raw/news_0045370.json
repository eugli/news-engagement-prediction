Emma Hulse says she was sent home for being too good-looking. Source: Instagram \n“I got there and spoke to the line manager and he asked me, ‘are you a model? Are you not doing catwalks, why are you not at the front of house?’\" Emma told The Standard . Just five minutes into her work day, she was sent home.

I didn’t really know what to do,\" Emma said. \n\"We were supposed to finish at 6pm and I got there for 9.30am and when I got there this other runner started explaining to me what I should do. \n\"Then they send me on a run. Then my agent text me that I’m no longer required.\" \nShe then speculated that the company may only employ unattractive workers. \n\"Maybe that company employs plain looking people and maybe if you don’t look that way they don’t take you,\" she said. \n\"Maybe I was a distraction.\" Emma believes her appearance worked against her.
