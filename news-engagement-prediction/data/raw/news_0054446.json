The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe members are concerned the once-stalled project would affect its drinking water supply and place downstream communities at risk of contamination from potential oil spills. The protest camp has at time housed thousands of people but it has dwindled to just 200 as the pipeline battle has largely moved into the courts The Army Corps of Engineers have told those who remain at the camp that they need to leave by 2pm today. Officials cite the coming threat of spring flooding as a safety issue that requires clearing the camp. Large-scale arrests are possible but Morton County sheriff's spokesman Maxine Herr insists that is not what the authorities want. She said: 'We prefer to handle this in a more diplomatic, understanding way. We are seeking to take the moral high ground and help them gracefully exit.' She added that a transition center will be set up to help protesters who don't have a place to go. For months, natives and their supporters camped out at the Oceti Sakowin camp in protest of the pipeline. Most of the camp has since dispersed due to the threat of spring flooding The project is pushing forward despite their protests. Above, crews remove waste at one site last week Some protesters plan to move but some in the camp are ready to go to jail. American Indian activist Chase Iron Eyes said: '[Some] will engage in peaceful, civil resistance... holding hands, standing in prayer.' Valerie Armstrong, 36, from Sherman in Texas, told CNN: 'I'm not going anywhere. I carry a knife with me all the time. But I am handing that over so that I have no weapons on me. I will stay and pray even if they come to remove us.' Ellie Davis added: 'There's obviously despair. There is like a deep sadness... This was beautiful what was built here.' Phyllis Young, one of the camp leaders, said: 'The camps will continue. Freedom is in our DNA, and we have no choice but to continue the struggle.' Other camps are popping up on private land in the area, including one the Cheyenne River Sioux has set up about a mile from the Oceti Sakowin camp. 'A lot of our people want to be here and pray for our future,' tribal Chairman Harold Frazier said. President Trump pushed ahead with the Dakota Pipeline project in an executive order on January 24, three days after he was sworn in Nearly 700 people have been arrested since protests first began last year, according to law enforcement officials. Former president Barack Obama had blocked the pipeline's construction but his successor Donald Trump formally backed the project in one of his first acts as president. Last week Pope Francis appeared to take on Trump by saying indigenous people should have a say over their land during a meeting with representatives of indigenous people at the Vatican.
