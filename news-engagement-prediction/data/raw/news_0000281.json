The news comes only days after there was uproar about Mrs May inviting US President Donald Trump on a state visit to the UK. Earlier today the Foreign Office issued a sternly worded statement condemning Israeli plans to build 3,000 homes for settlers in the occupied West Bank. Middle East Minister, Tobias Ellwood said: 'The announcement of further settlement units in the West Bank is part of a growing trend which we condemn. 'We have consistently been clear that settlements are illegal under international law, and not conducive to peace. 'This spike in settlement activity undermines trust and makes a two state solution â€“ with an Israel that is safe from terrorism and a Palestinian state that is viable and sovereign - much harder to achieve.' The Jewish Chronicle reported Mr Netanyahu would arrive in Britain on Sunday evening and meet the British Prime Minister on Monday at Downing Street. Two Palestinian men walk past the huge wall Israel has constructed illegally in the occupied West Bank. News of next week's visit came only hours after the Foreign Office condemned the construction of another 3,000 homes for Israeli settlers Mr Netanyahu visited in 2015 and met then Prime Minister David Cameron but he has never met Mrs May, having snubbed her during her only official visit to Israel, as Home Secretary, in June 2014 because he was handling a crisis after three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and killed. They were due to meet last month at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland but Mr Netanyahu cancelled the meeting after Britain voted in favour of a UN Security Council resolution against Israel's settlement policy.
