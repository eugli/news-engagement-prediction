One over Zoohky’s face, another over his stomach and the third over his bike, which he was famously known to be riding around on.\nFor community members, this is an unfortunate event.\n\"He was a very significant figure in the West End,\" said Charlie Johnston, a mural artist. \"Murals like that should last a long time.\"\nThe original owner's sold the building, and it has since become a church and that required some renovations.\n\"We have the intention of keeping the mural, even though changing the window kind of a little bit, disfigured the building,” said Yemi Okunnu from the Redeemed Christian Church of God.\nHowever, for people lamenting the loss of Zoohky's face from the mural, the church is working with the West End Biz to bring it back to life.\n\"There is going to be a vinyl covering that they're doing,” said Joe Kornelsen. “We're very happy they're willing to take these steps to preserve the mural.\"\nThe West End Biz hopes Zoohky's face will be back on the mural by the summer of 2017.\nPhotos The West End Biz hopes Zoohky's face will be back on the mural by the summer of 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T06:55:30.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
