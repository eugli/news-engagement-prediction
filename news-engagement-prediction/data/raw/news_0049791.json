The majority of new funds will be needed for single adult shelters. \nThe $1.7 billion budget for DHS this year represents a 20% jump from the year before. Most of that, $1.4 billion, goes directly to shelter capacity. \nCity officials say they know they’ll likely have to spend more, but are waiting until de Blasio releases a long-promised homelessness plan in coming weeks. A revised figure will be in the mayor’s executive budget in the spring. There are 60,048 people living in city shelters as of this Monday. The population crossed the 60,000 mark for the first time ever in the fall.

The population crossed the 60,000 mark for the first time ever in the fall. \nShelter spending comes out to about $23,300 per person. \nHomeless spending has surged in part because the city is using expensive commercial hotels to house homeless families, according to IBO. De Blasio has vowed to phase out the practice, but it continues to be widespread. \nChild abuse cases, homelessness on rise in NYC, de Blasio reports \nWhen spending related to homelessness from agencies outside DHS is counted, the city is spending $2.3 billion this year on the issue, City Controller Scott Stringer said last week. \nBy comparison, the 2017 budget is $4.9 billion for the NYPD, $1.8 billion for the FDNY, and $11 billion for the Department of Education.
