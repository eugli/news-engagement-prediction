(Photo: Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nOne of the NFL's worst-kept secrets is now out in the open: Kyle Shanahan is the new coach of the San Francisco 49ers. \nThe Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator officially agreed to terms Monday for the top job in San Francisco on Monday, the day after his team's 34-28 overtime loss to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI. Shanahan could not officially be hired until the completion of the Falcons' season. \n“It is truly an honor to be named head coach of the San Francisco 49ers, one of the marquee franchises in all of sports,” Shanahan said in a statement. “I must thank (49ers CEO) Jed and the York family for entrusting me with this great privilege and tremendous opportunity. I would also like to express my gratitude to Arthur Blank, Dan Quinn and the Atlanta Falcons organization for their support and the experience of a lifetime.\" \nMORE COVERAGE: 10 NFL offseason story lines to watch: Where does Tony Romo land? \nShanahan had long been expected to fill the NFL's only remaining coaching vacancy. He joins new general manager John Lynch, who last Sunday was revealed as the San Francisco's choice for the position despite having no prior front-office experience. \n“The San Francisco 49ers are very fortunate to be able to bring in a coach of the caliber of Kyle Shanahan,” Lynch said in a statement. “As an offensive mind, I think he stands alone in the National Football League, as evidenced by the explosive and record-setting offense in Atlanta. Though he grew up around coaching, what has most impressed me about Kyle is that he’s become his own man in the profession. Our philosophies on football and our visions for leading the 49ers back to being a championship team align in every way. I am thrilled to have Kyle Shanahan on board.” \nIn Atlanta, Shanahan engineered the league's high-scoring offense. Now he'll be tasked with reviving a San Francisco attack that ranked 31st in total yards last season. \nThe hire is the third in as many years for the 49ers, as Chip Kelly and Jim Tomsula were dismissed in the last two years after just one campaign each. \nPHOTOS: Best of Super Bowl LI Facebook Posted!
