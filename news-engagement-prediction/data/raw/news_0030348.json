Jeremy think you should do some serious apologising.\" Another added: \"Let's hope you're going to prove that love to your son! Anyone can write it in a tweet!\" \nLast night Jez posted an adorable picture of his son alongside the message: \"Happiest man alive, my new focus\". Stephanie Davis (Photo: WENN.COM) \nHe also recently admitted that if he is the dad, he will be prepared to work together with Steph for the sake of their son. \nThe tattooed hunk met the former Hollyoaks actress last year when they both took part in Celebrity Big Brother . \nThey fell in love and continued dating on the outside world until things turned sour a few months later.

Jeremy shared this picture of Caben-Albi \nIt comes after Stephanie Davis deleted any trace of the statement she put out after her ex, Jeremy McConnell, took swabs for a DNA test on live TV. \nFollowing the This Morning segment on Thursday, during which Jeremy opened up about not being there for Steph throughout her pregnancy, the ex-Hollyoaks star had tweeted a statement about Jez's treatment of her. \nShe said she felt \"humiliated\" by the way in which Jeremy demanded to know whether he was the father of her newborn baby, Caben-Albi, and said he had ruined her pregnancy.
