Reports suggest that Katamarayudu is on the last leg of the shoot with just a couple of songs to be filmed for which the actor is back. \nPawan Kalyan was also back from his five-day US tour a week back to finish with his part. Katamarayudu is all geared up for a release for Telugu New Year Ugadi in March this year. \nKatamarayudu is the Telugu remake of Tamil blockbuster Veeram. The movie will feature Pawan Kalyan as a faction leader. Actor Shruti Haasan will be seen opposite him in the film.
