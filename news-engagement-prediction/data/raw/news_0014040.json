I see synergies between MediaLink and our portfolio of products to significantly help accelerate our existing businesses and create additional value for shareholders .” \nFounded in 2003 by Chairman and CEO Michael Kassan, MediaLink employs 120+ employee in the U.S. The company will further strengthen and accelerate Ascential’s business strategy, which is to own scaled, global, market-leading businesses and brands in marketplaces where it offers trusted information and valuable connections to business professionals. \nMichael Kassan, Chairman and CEO of MediaLink commented: \n“This is a transformational moment for MediaLink. Propelled by the global footprint of Ascential and the combined resources and talent of our organisations, we are going to write the greatest chapter in MediaLink history. We look forward to collaborating to pursue growth and new opportunities for both companies.” \nKassan will continue as Chairman and CEO of MediaLink, working closely with Painter to integrate and accelerate the business, leveraging Ascential’s assets and infrastructure over the coming months and years. \nMediaLink has worked with Cannes Lions’ customers since 2011. Neutrality is a key focus of both businesses, and they will be run independently. MediaLink will continue to build on its relationship with Cannes Lions and start new ones with other Ascential products where appropriate. \nThe transaction is expected to complete, subject to customary U.S. regulatory clearance, within the next month and, upon completion MediaLink will form part of Ascential’s Information Services division. Aryeh Bourkoff’s LionTree Advisors acted as financial advisors to MediaLink with LionTree Partner Ben Braun serving as principal advisor. \nENDS \nNotes for Editors: \nAbout MediaLink \nMediaLink operates at the intersection of media, marketing, advertising, entertainment and technology, delivering companies the advice, partners and opportunities it needs to enable change and drive actionable solutions.
