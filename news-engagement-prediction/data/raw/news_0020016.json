Most of them are from Syria, Iraq, or Afghanistan.\nThere are more than 60,000 migrants and refugees living in camps around Greece, most of which are ill-equipped to handle the number of people and winter cold. Watchdog groups have called the living conditions appalling and inhumane . Many people in these camps became stranded after border closings blocked their way toward Western Europe last year and have been waiting for either asylum or deportation for nearly a year.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Migrants", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Fmigrants-and-refugees-stuck-in-greece-are-protesting-dire-living-conditions", "https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/01/23/greece-dire-refugee-conditions-islands", "http://www.amnesty.eu/en/news/press-releases/all/greece-refugees-facing-freezing-conditions-on-the-mainland-and-islands-1016/#.WJonfpMrKi4"], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:03:04.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
