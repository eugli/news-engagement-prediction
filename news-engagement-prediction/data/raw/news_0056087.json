Slot to Florida State Links (Photo: Melina Vastola, USA TODAY Sports) \nFlorida State athletics director Stan Wilcox said the ACC's revised television deal will deliver an increased payout of $3 million in the 2017-18 fiscal year. \nWilcox was asked about ACC television distributions at an FSU Board of Trustees meeting on Wednesday morning. A boost was expected with the July 2016 announcement of the ACC Network Extra by league commissioner John Swofford \nRevenues will jump once the \"linear\" ACC Network launches in the fall of 2019. Wilcox said the ACC's projections have indicated that the distribution per school will increase by $8 million-$10 million in 2019-20, and then $10 million-$15 million in future years. \n\"These are all projections,\" Wilcox said. \"It all depends on how well the network does. They are saying this network should have the same kind of return that the SEC Network has had in their first couple of years.\" (Get FSU news sent directly to your inbox!

Increased revenue helps to pay salaries for coaches, upgrade facilities and finance other long-term projects. \nThe B1G Ten and SEC have vaulted to the front of the pack in regard to revenue distributed to each school due to the creation of their own conference networks. And the ACC has long pursued a channel as part of its deal with ESPN, and a linear channel will launch in 2019 that will bring added revenue to the league's 15 schools (including Notre Dame). \n\"The way we close the gap is by creating the network, which we've done,\" Wilcox said. \nOne of the big questions with a linear ACC Network has been distribution and how much cable companies and satellite providers will be able to charge customers to carry a channel. That number remains up for debate, but the projections Wilcox delivered to the BOT assert that the ACC and ESPN are confident that they will be able to add the channel as either part of a basic package or on a sports tier in a large number of households across the ACC footprint.
