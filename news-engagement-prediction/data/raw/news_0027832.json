The Nation is now headquartered in Chicago, where it usually holds its convention, but this will be the fourth time it has held its convention in Detroit in the past 10 years. \nRelated: Nation of Islam comes home to Detroit for convention \nTitled “The Ultimate Challenge: Survival of the Black Nation,” this year’s convention comes at a politically tense time in the U.S., with a new administration after eight years in office of the first African-American president. But Muhammad said the focus of the Nation of Islam remains the same regardless of politics: being self-sufficient economically and socially. \nFarrakhan’s message on Sunday is titled “Have No Fear For The Future: The Future is Ours.” Buy Photo \nStudent Minister Troy Muhammad, head of the Detroit chapter of the Nation of Islam, in 2014 front of a photo of Elijah Muhammad in 2014, the head of the Nation of Islam from 1934-1975.

No one is going to do it for us. Many thought that if Hillary Clinton wins, she would do it for us. Some thought, if Donald Trump wins, he would. But at the end of the day, no politician can do it. We have to do it for ourselves.” \nThe Nation’s message resonates for many in Detroit, which is 79% African American and where the Nation’s themes of black self-empowerment are popular. Farrakhan’s Detroit lectures draw packed crowds, including at Joe Louis Arena in recent years. \nFarrakhan has called in recent years for members of the Nation of Islam to invest in Detroit and buy property in the city. \n“Detroit is very special to the Nation of Islam,” said Muhammad. “A few years ago, Minister Farrakhan asked the members to invest in the city of Detroit, move to Detroit, and do business in the city ... the perfect city to rebuild. He wanted us to be involved in that rebuilding, to help build the city of Detroit in all its aspects.” \nMany who attend Nation of Islam events are not Muslim and of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. \n“As a child growing up ... the Nation of Islam has always been a steadfast force of positive inspiration for me, a lifelong Baptist,” said Sam Riddle, a Detroit activist and political consultant. “Role models embodying self-respect and self-love will fill downtown Detroit, making Saviours’ Day a profound good news story.” \nOpen to all, the workshops at the convention include discussions about housing, marriage and family, civic participation, agriculture, and emergency preparation. It will include a special session at 10 a.m. Saturday in Cobo titled “The War on Islam,” which will address what it sees as growing attacks on Islam, such as the recent travel ban aimed at Muslim-majority countries. And there will be a Children’s Village with activities and games for kids. \nMembers of the audience listen to Minister Louis Farrakhan speak at the Nation of Islam Saviour's Day Convention at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit in Feb. 2016.

When Fard Muhammad arrived in Detroit, his message appealed to many African-Americans in the middle of an economic depression and racism in the job market and housing. \n“Islam is a way of life and so it teaches us ... a knowledge of ourselves, which was taken away from black people in America when we were taken from our homeland and brought here and enslaved,” she said. “The knowledge of self is one of the main components that our people get in the Nation of Islam. ... If you know who you are, you’re able to better know your purpose in life.” \nThe convention is also a way for people to reunite across generations, said Maria Muhammad. \n“We have people of many generations who were touched by Islam,” she said. “Some are bringing their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, to give them a reintroduction to a way of life.” \nContact Niraj Warikoo: nwarikoo@freepress.com or 313-223-4792.
