Sex will make you happier in the middle of the day? Yeah, right. I don’t know about you but I’m not trying to go to work after a little romp. After I have a sex, I’m trying to catch a nap and a few hours on twitter before falling asleep with my phone in my hand. Going back to work through traffic and shit would be the absolute worst. \nIf you have to go home to have this sex, you are basically fighting traffic 4 times in one day. You have your morning rush hour, sex hour, return from sex hour traffic, and then the commute home at the end of the day. FUCK THAT. I’d rather not have sex than fight traffic four times in one day. \nOn the other hand, I’d always be caught up on my podcasts like the Podfathers. Perhaps you should go home on a fuck break right now and listen, subscribe and review after you make a baby with your semen and or vagina.
