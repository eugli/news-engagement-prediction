(Submitted by Kelsey Friesen) \nA 50-year-old man has been charged with negligence after 14 dogs died of heat exhaustion at a Saskatoon dog kennel last year. 'We are heartbroken,' says manager of Saskatoon kennel where 14 dogs died \nAn investigation by the Saskatchewan SPCA has found the dogs were left unattended overnight at the Playful Paws Pet Centre in September 2016. Investigators found the dogs were left without water and in a room that was dangerously warm. \nAccording to previous interviews with the kennel's owners, the building's heating system malfunctioned and pushed hot air into the upstairs, windowless room for hours. \nIn the aftermath, many of the angry dog owners considered taking legal action against the clinic. \nWhen contacted this morning, the Playful Paws Pet Centre told reporters no one was available for comment. \nThe 50-year-old will appear in provincial court next month.
