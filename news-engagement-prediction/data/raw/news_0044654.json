He then told reporters that the investigation was being \"politicized by Malaysia in collusion with South Korea.\" Also on Monday, security footage surfaced that appeared to show the assault on Kim Jong Nam shortly before his death. Security footage from Fuji TV appears to show the moment Kim Jong Nam was attacked February 13. The suspects Kim died February 13 at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2, where he was planning to catch a flight to the Chinese-controlled city of Macau. He \"felt like someone grabbed or held his face from behind\" and then started to feel dizzy, according to Selangor State Criminal Investigations Department Chief Fadzil Ahmat. An ambulance was eventually called to take him to the hospital, but he died en route. So far, police have arrested four suspects and looking for four more who were believed to have left Malaysia the day of the attack. One of the people in custody told police she thought she was participating in a gag for a television show. The four who fled are North Korean, as is one of the four currently in Malaysian custody. Interpol is assisting with the search of the suspects at large, each of who left Malaysia the day of Kim's death, Malaysian authorities believe. When asked if North Korea had ordered his murder, a top Malaysian police official merely said, \"the four (on the run) hold North Korean nationality, that is all.\" CNN's Kocha Olarn reported from Kuala Lumpur, while Joshua Berlinger reported and wrote from Hong Kong.
