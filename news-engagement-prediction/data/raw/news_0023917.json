Tutty made a video to promote epilepsy awareness after her partner and son's father died in car crash after suffering a seizure. \nThe partner of a man who died in a car crash before his son was born hopes more awareness about epilepsy will prevent the same thing happening to others. \nIn 2014 Marshall Daldry died after suffering an epileptic seizure whilst driving. \nHis partner Laura Tutty was pregnant at the time with their son MJ Daldry-Tutty. supplied \nMarshall Daldry never got to meet his son before he died. \nMJ is now 2, and Tutty has made a video to share Daldry's story with both her son and with the public. \nShe posted the video on Facebook and it has since received 245 shares and more than 8000 views. \nIn it she remembers Daldry and urges people to be more aware of epilepsy. \n\"When Marshall passed away I decided I wanted to do something,\" Tutty told Stuff . \n\"I saw him really struggling, he was pushed aside over and over again. \n\"Ever since then I wanted to do something to make people realise.\" \nTutty said it had been hard after Daldry died, being pregnant as well. \n\"I didn't leave the house. \n\"But once MJ arrived it got a bit easier because I guess I had something to focus on.\" \n\"Its just hard sometimes, it's something I'm going to have to explain. \n\"That is the saddest part of it, MJ will never get to [meet his dad], and Marshall never got to experience being a dad when more than anything in the world that was what he wanted.\" \nTutty said she wanted to make a book for her son and asked for help on Facebook. \n\"From there it just snowballed.\" \nShe got responses from all across the world with people sending pictures of cards reading \"Marshall, Laura and MJ's love for you is so big it has reached ____\" \nTutty used them to make a video and said she thought at most a couple hundred people might see it. \n\"It was cool seeing people get behind it\" \nShe hoped the video would not only show MJ who his father was, but also encourage people to think more about epilepsy. \n\"If you have not had someone in your life who has had it, you don't understand it.\" \nTutty said Daldry had his first seizure at 16 and they had been quite sporadic. \n\"Then all of a sudden it became more and more frequent.\" \nDaldry's medication had made him sick and was really harsh, she said. \nShe said there was need for more alternative treatments. \n\"It is 2017, we should be looking at those other medications, there's no reason why it shouldn't be used, it has been shown it helps.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:08:19.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
