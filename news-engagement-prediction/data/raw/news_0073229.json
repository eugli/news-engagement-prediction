He said it was natural for “two strong, sovereign countries” to disagree at times, but added they would continue their dialogue.\n“In a relationship filled with vibrant colors, two strong sovereign countries will have their differences,” Tillerson said, summarising the talks which he said covered “the full range of bilateral issues”, including defending the border against “terrorism” and “drug cartels”.\nMexico will not accept Trump's immigration plans, says foreign minister Read more\nThe visit by Tillerson and the head of homeland security, John Kelly, was intended to be a bridge-building exercise, to soothe fears aroused by Trump’s racist rhetoric both on the campaign trail and during his continued demands that Mexico pay for a wall on the US border.\nSenior US officials had said the talks in Mexico City would highlight mutual interests in fields like counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism and securing Mexico’s southern border.\nBut new US immigration proposals unveiled on the eve of the trip, aimed at more deportations of Mexican and other Latin American undocumented immigrants, drew an angry response from the Mexican government and threatened to derail talks. After Trump’s remarks on Thursday, a minister cast doubt on whether a planned meeting between Tillerson, Kelly and the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, would even take place.\nThe foreign minister, who is a close aide to President Peña Nieto, declared that Mexico would defend its migrants living in the United States and go to the United Nations if necessary. He also rejected any suggestions that non-Mexican deportees would be deported to Mexico, dismissing the US proposals as “unilateral”.\n“It will be a long road to building an agreement with the United States,” Videgaray said, “but we have taken a step.”\nTrump used his remarks to US business leaders to combine a vigorous defence of deportations with a fresh attack on the 1994 Nafta free trade agreement, which is strongly supported by the Peña Nieto government.\n“We’re going to have a good relationship with Mexico,” the president said, before adding: “And if we don’t, we don’t.”\nNoting that Tillerson was in Mexico City, Trump said: “That’s going to be a tough trip. Because we have to be treated fairly by Mexico … But he’s over there with General Kelly who’s been unbelievable at the border.\n“What’s happening at the border: for the first time we are getting gang lords out, drug lords out. These bad dudes out of this country and at a rate that nobody’s ever seen before and they’re the bad ones,” the president said. “It’s a military operation … Much of that is because people are here illegally. And they’re rough and they’re tough but they’re not tough like our people. So we had to get them out.”\n“We are getting bad dudes out of this country at a rate we’ve never seen before,” the president said.\nBut in Mexico City, Kelly appeared to contradict Trump, insisting there would be “no mass deportations” and “no use of military force in immigration”.\nMexico’s economy minister, Idelfonso Guajardo, said the planned meeting between the two US cabinet secretaries and Peña Nieto at the Los Pinos presidential residence, would be dependent on the outcome of the ministerial talks.\n“The meeting at [Los] Pinos will happen, if it happens, in the context of the agreements they reach,” and if there are clear messages to be sent through the envoys, Guajardo told Foro TV.\nThe remarks by Videgaray and Guajardo seemed to indicate a tougher stance by the Mexican government in response to the Trump administration.\n“The language has changed,” said Esteban Illades, editor of the Mexican magazine Nexos. “It took them long enough, but they’re finally saying ‘no’.”\nThis is not the first time placatory messages carried by members of Trump’s cabinet have been undermined by contradictory signals emanating from the White House.\nBefore Vice-President Mike Pence went to Brussels last week to pledge a “steadfast and enduring” US commitment to the European Union, Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, met the German ambassador to Washington, according to Reuters news agency, and described the EU as a flawed construct, making clear that the new administration preferred to conduct bilateral relations with individual European countries.\nA German official confirmed that the meeting between Bannon and the ambassador, Peter Wittig, had taken place but refused to characterise the conversation. The official, however, pointed out that it was against the EU charter for EU member states to carry out bilateral trade negotiations with non-EU countries.\nUS foreign policy Mexico Americas Rex Tillerson Donald Trump news Reuse this content", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F23%2Frex-tillerson-john-kelly-mexico-trump-bad-dudes%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;wwc=1", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Tillerson%20endures%20%27tough%20trip%27%20to%20Mexico%20as%20Trump%20stokes%20%27bad%20dudes%27%20rhetoric&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F23%2Frex-tillerson-john-kelly-mexico-trump-bad-dudes", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Tillerson%20endures%20&#x27;tough%20trip&#x27;%20to%20Mexico%20as%20Trump%20stokes%20&#x27;bad%20dudes&#x27;%20rhetoric&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F23%2Frex-tillerson-john-kelly-mexico-trump-bad-dudes%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F23%2Frex-tillerson-john-kelly-mexico-trump-bad-dudes", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F23%2Frex-tillerson-john-kelly-mexico-trump-bad-dudes%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb", "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-trump-idUSKBN1601DS"], "published": "2017-02-24T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:32:53.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
