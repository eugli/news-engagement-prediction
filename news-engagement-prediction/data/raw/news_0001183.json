David Davis publishes Brexit white paper - Politics live Read more \nHere are the key points of the Brexit white paper, which essentially builds and expands on May’s Lancaster House speech last month: Great repeal bill and control of UK laws \nThe paper says the government will bring forward a separate white paper on the great repeal bill. \nThis is legislation first announced by May in her Conservative party conference speech last year that will remove the European Communities Act of 1972 from the UK statute book and convert the body of existing EU law into British domestic law. \nThe paper confirms that “wherever practical and appropriate”, the same rules and laws will apply in the UK on the day after it leaves the EU as did before. \nIt also confirms that the government intends “take control of our own laws”, which will mean “bringing to an end the jurisdiction of the European court of justice in the UK” and establishing a new mechanism for resolving future disputes between the UK and the EU. The union and Ireland \nThe paper says the government will “work with the devolved administrations on an approach to returning powers from the EU that works for the whole of the UK and reflects the interests of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales” but does not go into specifics. \nIt also promises that no decisions currently taken by the devolved administrations will be taken away from them, and indeed that more decisions will be devolved (it does not say which). And it says it will pay particular attention to the Isle of Man, Channel Islands and Gibraltar, all of which have unique relationships with the EU. \nOn the island of Ireland and the common travel area with the UK, the paper notes the UK and Irish economies are “deeply integrated” and says the government will work to “develop and strengthen” those ties after Brexit. \nIt says it aims to retain “as seamless and frictionless a border as possible” between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and wants Irish and UK citizens to be able to continue to move freely north-south and east-west, “while protecting the integrity of the UK’s immigration system”. Again, it does say not how. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T15:30:39.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
