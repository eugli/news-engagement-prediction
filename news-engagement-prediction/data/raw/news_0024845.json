The schoolgirl was reported missing from The Moorside, a council housing estate on the outskirts of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, by her mother Karen in February 2008. Her disappearance sparked the largest search operation since the Yorkshire Ripper, involving 250 officers and costing £3.2m. Shannon was missing for 24 days before she was found, hidden away in the base of a divan bed in a dilapidated house. When she was found, police discovered Shannon had been tied with an elastic rope to prevent her escape and, at times, had been drugged. The details were harrowing. But, in a further twist, it later emerged that her own mother Karen, then 32, had staged the kidnap. In revelations which shocked the nation, it emerged that she had colluded with Michael Donovan - the uncle of her then boyfriend - so she could pocket money from the appeal. Matthews, who now lives under a new name and identity, was pictured out and about earlier this week. She now lives in southern England Shannon was found 23 days after she was reported missing in this block of flats. The flat where she was found belonged to the uncle of her mother's then boyfriend The duo's plan was to release the little girl in Dewsbury market, and have Donovan - whom she met at a family funeral the year before - ‘find’ her so he could claim the £50,000 reward money offered for her safe return. One of seven children by five different fathers, Shannon was chosen because she was a girl and she was more photogenic, maximising the financial reward. Detectives think Matthews had already settled on the idea of staging a kidnapping after seeing how much money poured into the Madeleine McCann fund, but may have copied some of the finer details from a similar plot in the TV show Shameless. The series of incidents plumbed new depths of depravity. But, it also went on to shape the rest of the young girl's life, leaving her grappling to find her way back to normality. Aside from her face being plastered all over national newspapers because of her mother's selfish actions, another consequence was being torn away from her maternal grandparents and her siblings. Actresses Gemma Whelan and Sheridan Smith have starred in a series called The Moorside, which is about the disappearance of Shannon Viewers praised the performances of Sheridan and Gemma, but the series has come under fire for turning the kidnapping into a form of entertainment Her grandparents had already been there for her on numerous occasions. Karen - who had a 60-a-day cigarette habit, funded by benefit payments of £286 per week - had been deemed unsuitable of caring for her daughter long before the fake kidnapping plot. So, when Shannon was born, June and Gordon happily stepped in to look after her, taking her into their home as soon as she came out of hospital. They then looked after her for the first few months of her life until it was time for her to go back to Karen. Throughout their life, when the children were an apparent inconvenience to Karen - who spent much of her time watching daytime TV and playing video games - Shannon sought solace in her grandparents. Even when Shannon was reported missing, Karen told the media she had six children and later had to correct herself to say seven - an indication of how much she cared for her children. So, when the kidnapping saga unfolded, they were called to help again. While Karen was talking to the police, social workers brought Shannon’s younger brother and sister, who still lived with their mother at the time, to their grandparents’ house. Karen - described by many as Britain's 'most hated mum' - served half of an eight-year prison sentence and now lives under a different name But, as the truth of Karen’s behaviour started to emerge under questioning, the children were taken back into local authority care. Karen was later charged with child neglect and perverting the course of justice over her daughter's disappearance. She and Donovan went on trial and were found guilty of kidnapping, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice. When the case concluded, June and Gordon had hoped to care for Shannon and her siblings themselves. A source close to the family said at the time that they were the 'most wonderful people'. 'They would be fantastic to look after the children,' they added. 'They've been through such a lot and what the children need is some stability in their life. 'June and Gordon are the only decent family those poor children have left in the world. 'They have made it clear that they want to take responsibility for the children. They feel it's the only way they will get the chance to live a normal upbringing.' But when they went to court they were told they were too old. Shannon was given a court-appointed new identity and welcomed into a new family. She is now 18. Her grandparents now have occasional updates from social services, but no contact. It is believed that Shannon has also not been in contact with her mother. The move was devastating for her grandparents who did so much to bring her up. Gordon’s health has deteriorated badly. He has lost almost three stones in weight and has been in and out of hospital. Speaking about the ordeal, in light of a controversial BBC drama which aired this week, she said: 'If she sees [the BBC drama], Shannon is old enough now to understand that it is about her,' says her grandmother June. 'She will know it is about the terrible things that happened to her. 'How is that fair? It will upset her.' Meanwhile, Karen - described by many as Britain's 'most hated mum' - served half of an eight-year prison sentence and now lives under a different name. Now aged 40, she is unemployed and living alone in southern England.
