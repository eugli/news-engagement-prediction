(Wendell Cruz/USA Today Sports) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  52 PM \nTAMPA — Baseball's pace-of-play debate suddenly has grown more contentious, with commissioner Rob Manfred threatening to enforce changes unilaterally after the Players Association balked at the proposals for 2017. \nTo which Yankees veteran reliever Tyler Clippard on Wednesday essentially said to Manfred: try us. \n\"If enough players are against the ruling, we would be more inclined to just ignore it,'' Clippard said on Wednesday. \"You would see a lot of weird stuff happening. \n\"If there's a pitch clock and you take more than 20 seconds, what, they're going to call a ball? Fans don't want to come to a game and see that. You going to stand out there for a minute and a half and walk a guy without throwing a pitch? How can that be good for the game?\" \nIgnoring a pitch clock might not work out so well for Clippard, but as you can probably guess, he's passionate in his feeling that nobody, including the commissioner, should be messing with way baseball is played at the major-league level. \nClippard doesn't claim to speak for anyone besides himself, and I did find something of a counter-point talking to Brett Gardner, who admits there are times \"where it feels like the game is dragging along.\" \nBut considering that the Players Association seems to be taking a stance against Manfred's ideas, Clippard's thoughts must be somewhat representative of the majority of players. \nAnd he's not against everything that is being proposed. He actually likes the idea of limiting mound visits by the manager, pitching coach, and catcher. \nBig picture, though, Clippard thinks ideas such as a pitch clock, limiting the use of relievers, and even turning the intentional walk into a hand signal (which is being adopted for 2017) to speed up the game are nonsensical.

Clippard said. \"We could just play home run derby if you really want to speed things up. \n\"I've never once had a fan say to me they wish the games were shorter. The only people you ever hear that from are ones who don't like baseball. They're not going to watch the games anyway.\" \nClippard says players have been made aware in union meetings of MLB's desire to play faster, and he said it's something everybody keeps in mind. He just wants to know why Manfred is forcing changes at a time when baseball is thriving as an industry. \n\"When you delve into the stuff, you can really go down a slippery slope and you take away from the game,'' he said. \"The appeal of baseball is it's been played for 140 years. It's part of our culture. If you don't like it, you don't like it.'' \nWhen I told him that Manfred often points out how the game is changing on its own, especially in the increase of match-up relievers, and such change needs to be managed to make sure baseball appeals to younger fans, Clippard disagreed. \n\"No, you absolutely don't need to do that,'' he said. \"That is the cool thing about the game, watching it change throughout the years. It was played a certain way in the '80s, the '90s, the early 2000s, and now the last five years you see it changing into something else. \n\"And 10 years from now it'll be a little something different. That's the cool part about the maturation of baseball in general. If you try to dip your hand in that pool and stir it up yourself, it takes away from it. \n\"Now we're trying to cater our game to something that may or may not be happening with the younger generation because our society is changing? To me that's kind of a weird proposition.\" Brett Gardner. (Ted S. Warren/AP) \nAs a reliever, and one who admits to working slowly, Clippard says yes, he has a personal bias. But he insists he doesn't see why anyone would have an issue with the way the game is played these days, including the abundance of flame-throwing relievers that has slowed the \"action,'' to use the word Manfred emphasizes, late in games. \n\"There are more strikeouts than ever but there are more home runs than ever too,'' said Clippard. \"What's wrong with that? You have guys who are throwing 100 — that's more exciting. That's why the strikeouts are up. But that's also why the home runs are up. \n\"So we're kind of in a sweet spot, I think. You've got power on power, guys swinging for the fences more than ever. I think fans love that.\" \nGardner has a slightly different perspective, at least on the late-inning relievers issue, some of which is inherent in the nature of hitters vs. pitchers. \n\"It's hard to create more action when you have all these relievers throwing harder than they ever have,'' Gardner said. \"We go to Cleveland and I'm facing Andrew Miller in the seventh inning?\" \nGardner smiled and continued: \"He's got no business pitching in the seventh inning. But it's not just him. Our bullpen has been a big strength for us that way. Every team has several guys throwing in the upper 90s. \n\"Every year it gets harder and harder to hit. So there are times where it feels like the game is dragging along, but as an offensive player it's up to us to get on base, create a little more action.\" \nEventually a limit on relievers per inning may help that cause. Soon enough a 20-second pitch clock is going to become a reality. And Joe Girardi on Wednesday suggested that baseball use an NLF-type head-set communication to eliminate mound visits. \nChanges are coming, but not without resistance. Players like Clippard, in particular, have fought them off for at least another year.
