The money is kept by TfL unless their software allocates an automatic refund or customers apply to be reimbursed. \nSince 2010, £72m has been returned to customers who either forgot, passed through an open barrier or passed through a faulty machine. \nToday Mr Farron is calling on TfL to do more to point out the cost of not tapping in our out to customers and make it easier to claim the money back. \nMr Farron added: “TfL seem to look the other way as it is such a money spinner for them. They need to stop treating commuters as cash cows.” \nThe revenue raised from incomplete journeys rose by £53 million in just twelve months, increasing from a total of £277m in 2015 to £330m in 2016. \nIn addition, those using contactless cards who did not tap in or out have been charged £40 million since 2015, with £5 million reimbursed. \nTfL said they have regular announcements and signage at stations reminding customers to touch in and out, and also regularly run marketing campaigns. There are also leaflets outlining how to use Oyster and Contactless at our stations and online. \nWhile they collect fares on behalf of National Rail, the London Overground and Docklands Light Railway, they are not responsible for the signage in all stations in the network. 'Over a quarter of commuters would forfeit holiday for reliable Tubes' \nShashi Verma, Director of Customer Experience at TfL, said: “We are constantly working to reduce the number of incomplete journeys, which we recognise are very often due to a simple oversight. \n\"Where we can, we give customers automatic refunds without needing to contact us. We also make it easy to obtain a refund online and through our local rate telephone number and regularly remind customers to touch in and out to guarantee the right fare. \n\"The maximum fare includes the amount that would have been due had the customer touched in and out.” \nA spokerson for London Travel Watch said TfL is a not for profit organisation, so money from incomplete journeys is reinvested in the transport network for the benefit of passengers. \nHowever a spokesperson from consumer affairs group Resolver said: “While making a complaint might seem a hassle, the fact is complacency means you’re effectively giving your hard earned money away. \n\"So if you want to beat train companies profiteering off simple errors, the best way to fight back is to complain when it happens to you.” \nThe station where London commuters are least likely to forget to tap out is Sudbury Town where 175 people were charged £858 in 2016.
