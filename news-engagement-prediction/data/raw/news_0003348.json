When you weren’t wallowing in your 15 minutes of self-induced fame with endless tirades against President Trump and his executive order, you flooded the airwaves with enough Crocodile Tears to fill the Hudson. \nIf that wasn’t enough you posed with an Islamic version of the Walton family on Sunday -- they looked like nothing more than props -- to show us how we can teach the world to sing in peaceful harmony. \nYou referred to President Trump’s executive order, which indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from entering the United States, suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days and blocked citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, refugees or otherwise, from entering the United States for 90 days: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen , as mean-spirited and a moral outrage, yet they bear a resemblance to an executive order issued by President Obama in 2011 and orders issued by the Department of Homeland Security last year. \nIn 2011, President Obama placed a six-month ban on all refugees from Iraq after a refugee was linked to the deaths of US soldiers in Iraq. \nAccording to a DHS press release, dated, February 18, 2016: \nThe Secretary of Homeland Security has determined that Libya, Somalia, and Yemen be included as countries of concern, specifically for individuals who have traveled to these countries since March 1, 2011. DHS continues to consult with the Department of State and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to develop further criteria to determine whether other countries would be added to this list. \nLast month , the United States began implementing changes under the Act. The three additional countries designated today join Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria as countries subject to restrictions for Visa Waiver Program travel for certain individuals. \nSure sounds like the same countries listed on President Trump’s executive order, doesn’t it, Senator? \nStrangely, you, nor your colleagues in dishonesty and deception from the liberal media ever uttered so much as a peep about those orders signed by Mr. Obama and authorized by the DHS. \nAs you well know, Senator Schumer, the president’s first constitutional duty is to protect the nation from all enemies, foreign and domestic. It is not his duty to bow to the neurotic, loony whims of women on \"The View,\" naïve, airhead actors at an awards ceremony or the anarchists your party has unleashed once again in big cities across the country. \nThe examples of terrorists who have infiltrated into the US under the guise of the refugee or visa programs are numerous. Here are just a few examples out of many: \nOn November 18, 2013 , in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Issa Doreh was sentenced to ten years in prison for “conspiracy to provide material support to terrorist, conspiracy to provide material support to foreign terrorist organization, conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, and providing material support to foreign terrorist organization.” Doreh was admitted to the United States as a refugee from Somalia . \nOn January 31, 2014 , in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Ahmed Nasir Taalil Mohamud was sentenced to six years in prison for conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Mohamud was admitted to the United States as a refugee from Somalia . \nOn April 20, 2015 , in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, Abdurahman Yasin Daud, a Somalian refugee was charged (along with six others) with conspiracy and attempt to provide material support to ISIS. \nOn February 18, 2015 , Al-Hazmah Mohammed Jawad was arrested as he attempted to boarda flight to Jordan to join and fight with ISIS in Iraq. Jawad was admitted to the United States in 2013 as an Iraqi refugee and he subsequently obtained a green card. \nOn January 29, 2013 , in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, Mohanad Shareef Hammadi was sentenced to life in prison for a number of offenses related to terrorism. Hammadi is a native of Iraq who was admitted to the United States as a refugee in 2009 . \nIn 2009, Ramadan Alwan, an al Qaeda-Iraq terrorist living as a refugee in Bowling Green, Kentucky — later admitted in court that they’d attacked U.S. soldiers in Iraq. An ABC News investigation of the flawed U.S. refugee screening system, which was overhauled two years ago, showed that the men were mistakenly allowed into the U.S. and resettled in the leafy southern town of Bowling Green, Kentucky. \nSudan was designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1993 due to concerns about support to international terrorist groups. Elements of al-Qa’ida-inspired terrorist groups remain in Sudan. Groups continue to operate in Sudan and there are frequent reports of Sudanese nationals participating in terrorist organizations. \nIran has been a financier and supporter of international terrorism since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, financing such groups as Hezbollah. Iran was implicated in the 2011 plot to assassinate the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the US, Adel al-Jubeir . Iran consistently taunts and threatens the US military in the Persian Gulf. \nLibya is a failed state that has become a training ground and recruitment center for ISIS and especially for ISIS members infiltrating into Western Europe under the cover of the EU refugee programs. \nThe war torn country of Syria is not only a haven for ISIS, but a training ground for future terrorists and ISIS operatives in North America and Western Europe. In a recent interviewwith the UK Express, an ISIS operative boasted that the group has infiltrated 4,000 people into Western Europe under the guise of posing as refugees. \nIn fact, one of the gunmen during the Paris attacks in 2015 had a Syrian passport on him when he was killed during the terrorist operation. \nIn July 2016 Mohammad Daleel, 27, blew himself up outside a wine bar in Ansbach, Germany. Fifteen people were injured. Daleel was a refugee from Syria who had arrived in Germany in 2014 seeking asylum. \nYou don’t know who these people are, or where they’re going, or what their motivations are, do you Senator Schumer? How is the government supposed to scrutinize the backgrounds of refugees, when laws prohibit officials from examining the social media pages of those who wish to settle in the USA? \nYou do know one thing though, Senator Schumer; they will eventually vote Democrat and that’s all that counts, national security be damned. \nLiberals claim that the US refugee program is as solid as steel. It’s more than obvious that the US refugee program is another inept federal government operation, a house of cards ready to collapse on the nation. \nMean spirited and a moral outrage Senator? \nMean spirited is a Jihadi firing a couple hundred rounds into innocent men and women in a crowded Paris theater. \nMoral outrage is an Al Qaeda operative roaming freely around the US, with a shiny new green card and a carload of C4. \nMean-spirited is a Jihadi driving over people with a semi-truck in downtown Nice. \nMoral outrage is a Somali refugee stabbing a dozen people at Ohio State University. \nMean spirited are the constant threats by Iran against the United States. \nMoral outrage is a series of ISIS suicide bombs detonating in the Brussels airport, killing 32 innocent civilians. \nNO ONE has a constitutional right to be here who is not an American citizen. Those who come here do so at the discretion of the president and the Congress, which represents we the people. You might want to explain that to your shrieking, naïve, delusional fellow Democrats, Senator Schumer. \nThe president of the United States is the leader of this nation. Like all leaders, he must make decisions that are sometimes unpopular among certain groups, for the greater good of America. Strength is a trait that has all but vanished among liberals and national security is anathema to the left’s obscene world view. It is more than obvious that Democrats are willing to gamble with the lives of the American people in order to be politically correct. \nYour actions this past weekend, Senator Schumer, have clearly demonstrated once again that the simplest equation in the world is LIBERALISM = ABSOLUTE WEAKNESS. \nSincerely, \nRay Starmann \nRay Starmann is the founder of US Defense Watch .
