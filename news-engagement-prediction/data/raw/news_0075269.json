The cafe, bakery, floral studio and private event space at 3870 N. High St. was quickly buzzing with cafe-goers and participants in a floral arranging class on its first day Friday. 14 photos Flowers & Bread features a floral studio, cafe, bakery and event space at 3870 N.… more For its proprietors, the wait was a long one. Taking a vacant residence-turned-offices and making it into 2,800 square feet of culinary and floral space with rooftop gardens, first- and second-floor patios and a French wood-fired oven was no easy task. The $775,000 investment began with the purchase of the property in March 2015 for $215,000. Then there was a zoning variance, substantial renovations and city inspections. \"It was a totally new concept – it wasn't plug-and-play,\" Wheeler said of the combination of business activities in one space, a house originally built in 1925. The idea for the venture grew out of strong demand for cooking classes that couldn't be accommodated at Seasoned Farmhouse and Wheeler and Lagrotteria's love for the simple pleasures of life – beautiful food, great coffee, fresh flowers and a good conversation with a friend, Wheeler said. And bread, especially excellent bread. While both are classically trained as French chefs, the partners knew little about baking bread. They serendipitously met Sarah Black, a native Central Ohioan who left an indelible impression on the New York bread baking scene . Black moved back to Ohio to become the \"bread\" in Flowers & Bread. Friday morning, she baked pain d'epis, which are cousins to the baguette, and sprouted wheat bread with toasted amaranth and sunflower seeds for use in the cafe. There was daily soup special of potato and leek plus grab-and-go sandwiches including radish, butter and arugula; ham, butter and cornichons and smoked salmon with fresh herbs and cream cheese. Jams for the \"PBJ of the day\" sandwiches are house-made, as is the butter. The operation, which has about 13 full- and part-time employees, will offer floral and bread-baking classes downstairs plus private events seating 30 on the second floor. The cafe seats 26 inside with room for more on the patio in nice weather. Wheeler does not yet have a firm estimate on expected annual revenue. She reflected on Flowers & Bread's location across High Street from one of Columbus' most beloved city parks and the Whetstone branch of the Columbus Metropolitan Library. It's also just up the street from Seasoned Farmhouse, another home-turned-offices she renovated into a cooking school. \"There's something rewarding about fixing up the old buildings,\" Wheeler said. \"This was a really run-down place across the street from the Park of Roses and our library. Every time I looked at this place, I just felt like this could be a corner that had life to it. That it could be something special.\" Katy Smith directs coverage for the weekly print edition of Columbus Business First.
