PUBLISHED: 11:13,  16, Thu, Feb 9, 2017 GETTY Nicola Sturgeon has been boosted by news a deal with Brussels could be possible \nThe SNP chief’s hopes of staying in the single market were given a cautious seal of approval by a pro-Brussels constitutional expert who was grilled by MEPs in the Belgian capital. \nLaw lecturer Dr Kirsty Hughes, who is a senior fellow at the pro-EU Friends of Europe think-tank, said she did “not accept” that it would be legally and politically impossible for Ms Sturgeon to seal a deal. \nAnd she railed against the quality of the Brexit debate unfolding in the United Kingdom, warning that relations between England and Scotland will become “very difficult” over the issue. Related articles Sturgeon slams 'PATHETIC' Corbyn for handing May Brexit 'blank cheque' \nDr Hughes, who has worked for the EU Commission, was invited to give evidence as an expert witness to the constitutional affairs committee, which is proving the legal complexities of Britain’s split from Brussels. \nDuring a hearing at the EU Parliament this morning she did not hide her disdain for Brexit and accused Theresa May of ignoring the views of people in Scotland and Northern Ireland who voted Remain. \nBut she was challenged by the former Ukip MEP Diane James, who said opinion polling showed there was little support for a second independence referendum amongst the Scottish public. EbS Dr Kirsty Hughes said Scotland could stay partly in the EU GETTY Theresa May is facing a tough time accommodating Scotland's interests in the talks \nMs James also pointed out that Ms Sturgeon has been rebuffed in her attempts to build a rapport with chief eurocrats, who bluntly told her that Scotland would have to quit the bloc alongside the rest of the UK. \nShe said: “They have been told repeatedly by the Commission, by Mr Tusk, by Mr Juncker, that no special deal can be done and I think we ought to accept that’s the case rather than try to circumvent the European mechanism which is making a very clear signal.” \nBut while Dr Hughes admitted there had been “no so-called Brexit bounce” in terms of support for splitting up the UK, but quickly added: “The wish for self-determination and to be a state in the EU is a reasonable one.” \nShe insisted she was not expressing an opinion on whether Scotland should go it alone, but then forcefully added: “I don’t accept the view that Juncker and Tusk have said no deal can be done.” \nThe law expert also bemoaned the fact that amendments to the Article 50 bill proposed by the SNP and Labour were rejected by parliament earlier this week, which handed Mrs May the power to formally begin divorce talks. The way pro-EU politics is playing out in the UK at the moment I would call it very disappointing Dr Kirsty Hughes \nShe said: “The position that the Labour leader and the Labour Party has taken, along with the Conservative party, is that the result of the referendum has to be respected and that it’s illegitimate at this point not to respect it and to argue against it. \n“I reject that view. The idea of being told to play with team UK as if we’re in a one party state is slightly offensive. \n“It’s perfectly acceptable to say that you respect the result, but you’re going to continue to argue against it and try to change minds, and if you see minds changing there should be a second referendum.” \nAnd she blasted: “There has been a lack of political leadership arguing the case as to why this is a hugely disastrous move for the UK and so to change minds. \n“The way pro-EU politics is playing out in the UK at the moment, I would call it very disappointing.” \nDr Hughes also offered a very pessimistic assessment of how she thinks the Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU will unfold, saying they will be “poisonous” and drive a wedge between England and Scotland.
