(Photo: Dan Bethencourt) \nAlmost exactly one year after five young Mexican immigrants — three of them teenagers — died in a Novi residential basement fire, the man who hired them, drove them to work and gave them a place to sleep pleaded guilty to a crime that could send him to prison for 10 years: harboring illegal immigrants. \nWith his teary-eyed, college-age daughters in the courtroom, 56-year-old Roger Tam admitted to what the government charged him with as he came to court with no deal on the table. He confessed alongside his wife, Ada Lei, 49, who pleaded guilty to the same crime. \nBut the couple could be spared prison if their lawyers have their way as the defense plans to ask for probation, arguing their clients have long felt terrible about the tragedy, but were in no way responsible for the workers' deaths. \n\"He has always felt horrible about this tragic accident. He really cared about these boys. This was an immigrant who was providing work to other immigrants,\" said Tam's attorney, Raymond Cassar, who argued the fire was accidental — likely caused by smoking in bed. \n\"We do not believe at all that this is a case where his action did anything to cause the deaths of these young men. The medical examiner ruled them as accidental deaths,\" Cassar said. “(Prosecutors) wanted us to accept responsibility for the deaths. There is just no way we could do that.\" \nThe issue of responsibility is expected to come up at sentencing, which is scheduled for June 13. According to the defense, prosecutors have pushed for the defendants to claim responsibility for the workers' deaths — an admission that could be used against them at sentencing. If the judge concludes that they were responsible, they could face stiffer sentences. \n\"We are never going to agree to any of those enhancements,\" defense attorney Art Weiss, another lawyer on the case, said following the plea hearing. \nInside the courtroom, Weiss stressed to U.S. District Judge Marianne O. Battani: \"Both clients had tremendous remorse ... they're trying to do the right thing.\" \nBut they put people in harm's way and financially benefited, argued prosecutors, who believe the restaurant owners should be punished for creating a situation that ended tragically. \n“These defendants are accepting responsibility for harboring undocumented workers and conspiracy, but we disagree about the appropriate sentencing guidelines that apply,” U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said following the guilty pleas. “At the sentencing hearing, the United States will seek a sentencing enhancement for creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to reflect the seriousness of the offense.” \nAdded Steve Francis, acting special agent in charge of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations in Detroit: \"These guilty pleas should stand as a warning to employers who knowingly hire and employ illegal aliens that they will be held accountable for their actions.” \nThe fire started on a mattress in the basement where the five victims were sleeping. \nTam, records show, owned the home on Mystic Forest Drive, where the Mexican immigrants slept at night, allegedly as a condition of working at his 26-year-old restaurant, Kim's Garden, on Novi Road. Authorities said one undocumented worker made $2,000 a month working 12-hour shifts, six days a week, plus Chinese food while on the job. \n\"Today the principal defendants were convicted for using illegal labor to operate restaurants in metro Detroit,\" \nRead more:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:13:15.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
