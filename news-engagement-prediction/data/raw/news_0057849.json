However, according to David Aldridge of TNT, what happens next is where there's a bit of a stalemate. \nAs Aldridge says, the Bulls would want more than just draft compensation for Butler, an All-Star starter at age 27. \nThey'll want players, either a young player with All-Star potential such as Jaylen Brown, or a promising rotation player with a desirable contract such as Avery Bradley or Jae Crowder, who was Butler's college teammate at Marquette. \nIt seems like the inclusion of Crowder is the biggest sticking point that could prevent the Butler deal from getting done. \nCrowder, 26, has developed into a reliable starter for the Celtics, scoring 14.1 points per game for coach Brad Stevens over the last two seasons. \nPerhaps more importantly, Crowder's contract is among the most team-friendly in the NBA, as he is locked up through 2019-20 at about $7 million per season. \nOne of the reasons it might be intriguing for Butler to play for the Celtics might be the reunion he could have with Crowder. \nHowever, it's ironic that it's because of his college teammate's value that Butler might end up staying put instead.
