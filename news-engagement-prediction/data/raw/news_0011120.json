Men at the top have got to share power with women. Read More \n\"That hasn't happened yet but it's got to. It's part of really changing Labour to make us the modern, equal, progressive party we ought to be.\" Harriet Harman said she should have \"made\" Gordon Brown appoint her as deputy PM (Photo: PA) \nShe hit out at Gordon Brown for not making her deputy prime minister in 2007 when she won the deputy leadership election. \n\"He should have done and I should've made him,\" she said. \nAnd she revealed she regretted not running for the leadership herself. \n\"I think the moment I should've run is in 2010 when Gordon stood down,\" she said. \n\"I became acting leader and suddenly realised I could do it. \n\"At that moment I should have stepped forward and it's a bit of a mystery to me why I didn't. The former acting leader also said Labour must \"get its act together\" under Corbyn (Photo: PA) \n\"I think the world is full of men who are not up to the job pushing themselves forward and loads of women who are up to the job who don't, and for that moment I was probably one of them.\" \nMs Harman said although Jeremy Corbyn must do more to encourage women, he was not the first leader to preside over a male-dominated party. \nBut she also launched a blistering attack on his leadership, claiming Labour must do more to become an effective opposition - let alone a credible party of government. \nShe warned there were \"painful echoes of the 1980s\" and the party is \"divided\". \nShe rejected any idea of a left-wing coalition, saying that had been suggested during Labour's previous woes, but \"actually what it needed was for Labour to get its act together instead of shouting at the public and telling the public where they were getting it wrong.\" \"The world is full of men who are not up to the job,\" she said (Photo: Sky) \n\"We are not in the situation we want to be and we really need to sort ourselves out,\" Ms Harman added. \nShe denied Labour was \"unelectable\" but said: \"I think you can't be an effective opposition if you haven't got enough public support because the government doesn't need to worry about you. \n\"We do need more public support in order to be an effective opposition, let alone a credible alternative government.\" \n\"It's no good having the right arguments or just speaking very loudly. You have to have the public on your side.\" \nJohn McDonnell insisted Labour will be ahead in the polls within just a year - despite languishing up to 17 points behind. John McDonnell said issues like the NHS would help Labour beat the Tories in polls (Photo: PA) \nThe Shadow Chancellor told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"The last 18 months we’ve spent half of them in leadership elections. \n\"People won’t vote for a divided party, we know that, and that’s why we’re behind in the polls. \n\"Once we get past Brexit we’ll unite the Labour party , we’ll be back on our agenda, and you’ll see I think that we'll have a significant impact on the political debate in this country which means we’ll go back in front of the Tories in the polls over the next year. \n\"That's what I think most of the Labour party members are actually campaigning for and support. \n\"We'll be on the Labour agenda of protecting our economy. They're preparing for a fight even though they've papered over the cracks at the moment.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T14:25:02.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
