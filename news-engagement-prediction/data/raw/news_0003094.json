Using an obscure law that allows Congress to review regulations before they take effect, the Senate voted to reverse the Stream Protection Rule , which seeks to protect the nation’s waterways from debris generated by a practice called surface mining. The Interior Department had said the rule would protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests by keeping coal mining debris away from nearby waters. The Senate vote was 54 to 45. The Obama administration had finalized the rule in its final days, putting it in the cross hairs of the Republican-controlled Congress, together with other last-minute Obama regulations . The House voted Wednesday to repeal it. The bill now goes to Mr. Trump, who has vowed to peel back regulations, for his signature.. “Make no mistake about it, this Obama administration rule is not designed to protect streams,” Representative Bill Johnson, a Republican from Ohio who sponsored the move to reverse the rule, said on Wednesday. “Instead, it was an effort to regulate the coal mining industry right out of business.” The Stream Protection Rule, which requires companies to restore mined areas to their original physical and ecological state and to monitor for environmental effects, would have effectively made mountaintop removal uneconomical, experts said — especially when coal prices remain depressed amid competition from natural gas and renewable energy sources like wind and solar. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But the rule was challenged in court almost immediately by Republican attorneys general in states across the country, as well as the Ohio-based coal giant Murray Energy. The company had previously filed 14,000 pages of comments opposing stronger regulations. “This unlawful and destructive rule is nothing but a thinly veiled attempt to destroy our nation’s underground coal mines and put our nation’s coal miners out of work,” Robert E. Murray, the mining company’s chief executive, said in comments released ahead of Thursday’s vote. A report released by the Congressional Research Service last month laid out the environmental and health benefits of the rule. Stream restoration requirements would reduce human exposure to contaminants in the drinking water, and the probability of adverse health effects, the report said. The replanting of trees also required by the rule would increase carbon storage and reduce emissions, aiding in the fight against climate change, the report said. The report also outlined the costs to industry: $52 million in annual compliance costs for the coal industry as a whole, of which roughly half was expected to be borne by mining operations in Appalachia. The rule could endanger up to 590 coal mining jobs in the region, the report estimated, though the losses would be partially offset by engineers and biologists that companies would need to hire to comply with its terms.
