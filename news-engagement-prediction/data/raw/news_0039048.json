Details of the calls, including whether they were related to Trump, were not disclosed.\nCohen, previously special counsel to Trump at his private company, said he knew of no contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians, but demanded, \"Even if there was one, so what?\"\nMichael Cohen, Trump's personal attorney, trashed the Times story. Source: BRYAN R. SMITH/Getty Images The New York Times singled out Paul Manafort , who oversaw Trump's dark-horse campaign until his replacement by now-top White House advisers Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway.\nManafort told the paper the allegations were \"absurd.\"\n\"I have never knowingly spoken to Russian intelligence officers, and I have never been involved with anything to do with the Russian government or the Putin administration or any other issues under investigation today,\" he said.\nContacted late Tuesday night, Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign adviser close to Manafort, called the Times story \"total bullshit.\"\nCaputo, a longtime political strategist who continued to back Trump after leaving the campaign, called Manafort \"a patriot\" and said flatly, \"He would never do this. These sources are lying, and the Times is printing fake news.\"\nFormer Trump aide Paul Manafort has denied any contact with Russian agents. Source: Matt Rourke/AP \"I worked right next to him, dined with him, drank with him,\" Caputo added in a series of online messages.\nCaputo laid the blame for the stories at the feet of officials who were appointed by former President Barack Obama, summing up his rejection of the New York Times piece as mere \"partisan sniping.\"\n\"The reporters are either lying or being lied to,\" Caputo said. \"It's anonymous fabricated bullshit from Obama holdovers.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html?_r=0", "http://ap.org/", "http://www.gettyimages.com/"], "published": "2017-02-15T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:36:20.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
