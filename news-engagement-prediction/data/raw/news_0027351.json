The Frenchman would almost certainly have to take a paycut, would have to leave the soft glades of Carrington, no doubt to the sound of that Sir Alex Ferguson half-time team-talk being played at max volume through the PA system, and make his way to the Big Smoke, with its inflated property prices, tube strikes and Dele Alli/Eric Dier friendship cliques. It just doesn’t make sense, especially when only on Saturday, Martial was doing this in front of a beaming José Mourinho. Still, that’s what the Mirror thinks is going to happen. You heard it here second.\nSadio Mané and Liverpool stop Spurs in their tracks – Football Weekly Read more \nMarcus Rashford is just about the most exciting player Manchester United have in their ranks at the moment. Naturally, the club are struggling to extend his contract, Rashford apparently unhappy at a lack of playing time, according to the Times. The Mill has heard this one before somewhere, it just can’t think where . At least the red half of Manchester has an expensive homecoming party to look forward to in 2020. \nWith those Martial and Rashford whispers and with a tingle still running down the neck of whoever signed Matteo Darmian, Torino’s new crown-jewel Andrea Belotti is the new face on the Manchester United ‘WANTED’ wall. The striker has scored 22 goals in 27 game in all competitions this season, including a few for Italy. “I’ve always dreamed of sitting next to Ashley Young,” he didn’t say.\nThe father of Monaco full-back Fabinho has been getting up to some textbook namedropping, telling French media that his son has “a soft spot” for Manchester City, who conveniently seem to have a bit of a soft spot in the full-back position. “We have been in talks with Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal and approached by Barcelona,” he Mr 15%ed. “We like Manchester United and Mourinho’s work, but we have a soft spot for Manchester City.”\nJust the fifth paragraph of today’s gossip and the Mill has already resorted to transfer rumours about a referee. Can you imagine Mark Clattenburg sunning himself on Venice Beach, the fake tan melting slightly over his Champions League and Euro 2016 tattoos in the Californian sun, his eyes obscured from view by sunglasses a couple of sizes too big for his head? Imagine no more, reader, for Clatters could be off to the Land of Free/Home of Brave™ after reportedly receiving an offer from MLS. Clatman admitted in December that “if an opportunity came along – I am contracted to the Premier League – but I have to look at my long-term strategy of my career”, failing to add that he longs once again to book Liam Ridgewell. That long-term strategy could see him join Howard Webb, who is already soaking up the ray$ on the other side of the pond as MLS’s new head of video assistant referee operations. The Mill, for one, can’t wait to see any further developments unfold. \n“If you ask for a rise it’s no surprise that they’re giving none away,” David Gilmour famously sung in 1973 , completely ignorant that by 2017 at Manchester United, the exact opposite applies. David de Gea is reportedly set to go from £200,000-a-week to £300,000-a-week after politely asking for a rise/reminding Ed Woodward that Real Madrid are still sniffing about.\nSpeaking of Los Blancos , The obscenely talented Isco – who used to do this , remember – had a decent game against Osasuna at the weekend. His contract is up in 18 months. Tottenham, Juventus and Chelsea are all loitering and Real are prepared to wait until the end of their transfer embargo this summer before making any decisions on the Spaniard. \nNo so much rumour, but a confirmed fact that may have passed you by: Coventry have signed Yakubu Aiyegbeni , who despite the relentless passing of time, remains just 34-years-old. The former Everton and Blackburn Rovers striker has signed a short-term deal until May – manager Russell Slade is “pleased.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:49:02.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
