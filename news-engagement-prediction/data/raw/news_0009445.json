The Louvre museum in Paris. De Agostini/Getty Images, file \nFrance's interior ministry said on Twitter that the incident was \"serious.\" The area was being evacuated. \nA police union official, Luc Poignant, told BFM-TV that the soldier had been assaulted and that the area was being secured. \nReuters quoted a police source as saying the solider had wounded a man armed with a knife who was trying to enter the tourist attraction. A second police source told Reuters the man had been trying to get into the museum's underground shop with a suitcase. NBC News could not immediately independently confirm those accounts. \nFrance has been under a state of emergency, since the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. \nSoldiers on patrol are part of security measures that have beefed-up in the wake of attacks in the capital and in Nice. \nThis is a breaking news story.
