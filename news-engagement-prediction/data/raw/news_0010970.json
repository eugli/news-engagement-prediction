I would've cycled everyday if I got the chance, but without special cycling tracks on the road, it is quite difficult,\" Al Labban, Graphic Designer at Dubai Statistics Centre. He got on his bike again for another two and a half hours to his office located at Academic City. Al Labban took up the habit of cycling two years ago as he was trying to shed some extra pounds. Two years ago, he was 140kg, now he weighs 105kg. He noted that the challenge he faces when on his bike is mainly the absence of safe cycling tracks. \"I try my best to use service roads, but sometimes I have no other option but to go on the highway. If there are safe tracks on roads between Sharjah to Dubai, I'd cycle everyday.\" He added that time-wise, cycling and driving between the two emirates take the same time. But cycling and using different modes of transport is better for physical and mental health. \"At least you avoid the road rage!\" he said.
