Key points: SCSA the only agency with dedicated program for children Youth Court judge calls for better support Intervention incarceration more prevalent among Aboriginal people \nSouth Australian Senior Youth Court Judge Penny Eldridge said intergenerational offending was a growing problem in the state, particularly among the Aboriginal population. \nShe said programs such as those run by the not-for-profit group Second Chances South Australia (SCSA) needed greater support. \n\"Sadly that is a feature of our court,\" Judge Eldridge said. \n\"There are a lot of youths who only appear once and we know having seen them that they are very ashamed and remorseful about their behaviour and will never do them again. \n\"But unfortunately there is another group that takes up a lot of our time and they are just the repeat offenders and sadly a number of them are Aboriginal offenders.\" \nSCSA runs a range of initiatives aimed at helping prisoners turn their life around but it is the only agency in Australia that also has a dedicated program to help the children of prisoners and reduce the chance of them following in the parents' footsteps. \nChief executive Helen Glanville described children, who are six times more likely to end up in prison themselves, as \"the innocent victims of crime\" and said they often fell through the cracks to be forgotten. \n\"Not one government body actually keeps a record of who they are and where they are,\" she said. \n\"They could be in foster care. They could be with other relatives but the federal, state and local government has no record.\" Mother in and out of jail for 10 years \nThroughout much of her childhood, Montana, 19, was left to fend for herself or be dumped with extended family or friends when her mother was taken to jail. \nShe said \"it would usually happen on a weekend\" and her and her sister would be left to sort out where they would be staying or who would be taking care of them. \n\"She was in and out for about eight to 10 years,\" Montana said. \n\"After a while you just get used to it and go on your daily routines.\" \nSchool was Montana's only reprieve. \n\"School was my escape from my home-life, I used to leave early just to get away from home and I would dawdle to get home,\" she said. \nBut a small gesture from her mother resulted in Montana's life changing for the better. \nShe took up an offer from not-for-profit group SCSA to send her daughter a birthday present while in prison. \nOnce an imprisoned parent requests a birthday present for their child, SCSA volunteers seek permission from the child's caregiver to send the present and asks whether they would like any support for the child. \nAt the age of 15, Montana attended one of 10 mentoring camps SCSA runs each year for the children of prisoners. \n\"There was a point to actually live, I was really down in the dumps, suicidal kind of, and then they just give you hope,\" she said. \n\"I use to be the loner kid in the corner, wearing black, wouldn't talk, always bullied and now I don't shut up. I'm very social now. I came out of my shell.\" \nMontana is now a leader on the camps for younger children and will begin studying at university this year with aspirations to become a high school teacher. \n\"I was pretty crappy, then I became a leader and now I can help other kids and show them that good can happen out of all of the crappiness,\" she said. Early intervention is crime prevention \nMs Glanville said early intervention was actually crime prevention because of the children's \"propensity or the associates that their mum and dad have had\". \n\"They didn't chose to be born into that family and they didn't chose to have the drugs and the alcohol and the influences of all that,\" she said. \n\"We want to break that intergenerational cycle and we can break it, if we get in early enough.\" \nJudge Eldridge said funding was key to breaking the cycle. \n\"I think basically it's a resources issue. I think there needs to be some programs but they need to be really, really intensive, I think, to have any success,\" she said. \nThe Youth Court is currently working to get a new nine-month, non-custodial program off the ground for young offenders. \nThe program will better direct youth to the help they need, whether it is drug and alcohol counselling, mental health treatment, getting them back to school, employment training and even helping with their housing situation. \n\"The support is needed in a number of areas at the same time if it's going to be beneficial,\" Judge Eldridge said.

(Supplied: SCSA) Prisons at risk of being 'normalised' through custody visits \nNational figures from the Australian Research Council showed that 20 per cent of prisoners have had at least one parent in jail during their life and 5 per cent have had both parents behind bars at some stage. \nProfessor Mark Halsey from the Centre for Crime Policy and Research at Flinders University said intergeneration incarceration was more prevalent in Aboriginal communities. \n\"When I spoke to Aboriginal people in prison they could name up to six or seven other family members who were also in prison on that particular day, whereas non-Indigenous people could name up to maybe one or maybe two others at the most,\" he said. \nHe said one of the main catalysts for intergenerational incarceration, especially in Aboriginal lives, was the issue of unresolved trauma and loss. \n\"Where we don't do so well is we don't get to the bottom of that trauma and loss both within custodial environments traditionally and even outside custodial environments,\" Professor Hasley said. \nHe has interviewed 70 prisoners in South Australia as part of a study on the issue, including many second and third generation prisoners, one fourth generation and one fifth generation prisoner. \n\"The more that children get used to going in and out of custody, visiting a loved one, a parent, there is a tendency for that particular aspect of life to become normalised,\" Professor Halsey said. \n\"Seeing prison or incarceration spaces as fairly common features in the life path of particular families. That mentality can be transferred to the next generation.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:49:42.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
