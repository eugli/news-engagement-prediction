MUST READ #IPL2017auction: Ben Stokes hogs limelight, goes to Rising Pune Supergiants for massive Rs 14.5 crore \nIt was definitely much less than last year when Negi's Rs 8.5 crore deal with Delhi Daredevils had surprised one and all. But being an Indian player proved to be his advantage. \nFor senior Test players like Cheteshwar Pujara and Ishant Sharma, it turned out to be an embarrassment as both went unsold at their base prices of Rs 50 lakh and Rs 2 crore respectively. Irfan Pathan also went unsold at his Rs 50 lakh base price. \nAmong the prominent international players, who failed to find takers, was South African spinner Imran Tahir, currently ranked No 1 in the ICC list for ODI and T20 bowlers. \nThe day certainly turned out to be a good one for the England players with Stokes hogging the limelight but Mills wasn't far behind either. \nThe first round of bidding for Stokes saw Mumbai, Delhi and RCB match each other till it reached Rs 10.50 crore after which the Reliance-owned franchise pulled out. \nDelhi and Bangalore continued to bid before Sunrisers entered the fray. But just when it looked that Stokes would go for around Rs 12.5 crore, Pune entered the fray and clinched the deal. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Monday, February 20, 2017 - 18:08 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:59:16.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
