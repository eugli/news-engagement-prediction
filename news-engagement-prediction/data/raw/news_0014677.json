Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nThe 2017 Makers Conference got underway yesterday at the Terranea Resort in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. (just down the street from Trump National Los Angeles if attendees want to get in round) with a special message from Hillary Clinton declaring that “the future is female”: Hillary Clinton in new vid for @MAKERSwomen : \"Despite all the challenges we face, I remain convinced that YES, the future is female.\" pic.twitter.com/FCjI5ey5ia \n— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) February 7, 2017 \nWhat she really means is that the “future is female” and liberal as the speakers at this conference include Trump-haters Patricia Arquette, Sophia Bush, Eva Longoria, Debra Messing, Rosie Perez, Cecile Richards and Gloria Steinem, among others. \nWould it kill them to have one conservative voice to speak about our female-led future? What a bunch of feel good hooey. https://t.co/AYqt9phbSc \n— Kathleen McKinley (@KatMcKinley) February 7, 2017 Trending Backfire alert! Dems given a clue what the 'Resistance' is REALLY doing \nAs for Hillary Clinton’s welcome video, we have questions. What’s up with her head? Am I the only the who thinks it looks like her head is detached and floating here? https://t.co/1HMGzfR0hp \n— Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) February 7, 2017 \nNope … not the only one: Her neck is giving me anxiety.
