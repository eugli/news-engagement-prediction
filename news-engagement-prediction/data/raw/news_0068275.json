The stories of the gentlemen who endured the battle with the Japanese soldiers will live on forever. Their stories are told time and time again to young people who are trying to earn the title of Marine. The stories are told some more in order to motivate those young people after they have earned the title. The stories are then repeated after those young people become older people as a sense of pride and belonging. The Marines on Iwo Jima are the reason Marines have the reputation that they do.
