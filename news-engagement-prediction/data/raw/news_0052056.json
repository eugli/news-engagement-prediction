Close 'Magnificent, history for Ross Taylor': Black Caps batsman reaches his 17th ODI century UP NEXT VIDEO Black Caps' Ross Taylor reaches his 17th ODI century. Source: Sky Sport 'Magnificent, history for Ross Taylor': Black Caps batsman reaches his 17th ODI century \nThe Black Caps had batted within themselves to reach 289-4 after losing the toss, and the Proteas initially looked comfortable in their run chase. \nBut they lost wickets regularly, so that although the run rate was ticking over nicely, the pressure came early on the middle and lower order. \nThe Kiwis looked to have done enough with a run of late wickets which left South Africa reeling at 217-8 with eight overs remaining. Another last over thriller sees the BLACKCAPS win the 2nd ANZ ODI by six runs and level the series 1-1! Wow, that got tight! #NZvSA ^WN pic.twitter.com/i28VQcPJbf â€” BLACKCAPS (@BLACKCAPS) February 22, 2017 \nBut a valiant 61-run ninth-wicket stand between Dwaine Pretorius and Andile Phehlukwayo nearly stole the win. \nTrent Boult, who finished with 3-63, rescued the match for the Black Caps in the 49th over, dismissing Pretorius for 50 off 27 balls. \nWith South Africa needing 15 off the final over, Tim Southee delivered four dot balls, and although Phehlukwayo managed two boundaries to finish the innings, the win was always out of reach. \"It was a big win for us. I thought we did well to get to our total and then the bowlers backed it up.\" - Ross Taylor #NZvSA ^WN pic.twitter.com/e6kT14O9ax â€” BLACKCAPS (@BLACKCAPS) February 22, 2017 \nWilliamson paid tribute to Taylor's \"brilliant\" century, which set up the narrow win, and a gritty bowling performance. Man of the Match for his 17th ODI hundred is @RossLTaylor ... Now the leading all time New Zealand ODI century scorer #NZvSA ^WN pic.twitter.com/vtJWZBMDe7 \n\"It was another tight one - wins against the best team in the world aren't going to come easy,\" Williamson said. \n\"I think the death bowling was superb and the boys held their nerve their at the end.\" \nThe loss snapped a 12-match winning streak for the Proteas, who hadn't lost an ODI since June last year. \nDe Villiers was left particularly disappointed with South Afica's batting performance. \"It was another great game & credit to the BLACKCAPS. We were in it right to the end, but too many soft dismissals cost us.\" - de Villiers pic.twitter.com/nf2dK1izIj â€” BLACKCAPS (@BLACKCAPS) February 22, 2017 \n\"I thought there were quite a few soft dismissals, and not enough good partnerships,\" he said. \n\"The ones we actually did get going, we didn't extend and it's crucial to do that if you want to win games of cricket.\" \nTaylor had earlier led the way for the Black Caps with an unbeaten 102-run knock. \"Milestone are always nice & extra special when it's a win. I used to love watching Nathan Astle bat!\" Taylor on 6,000 ODI runs & 17 ðŸ’¯s ^WN pic.twitter.com/7Yc4K6LT8x â€” BLACKCAPS (@BLACKCAPS) February 22, 2017 \nIn the process, the 32-year-old right-hander notched up 6000 ODI runs for New Zealand, the fourth Kiwi to reach that milestone. \nTaylor stroked a four off the last ball of the innings to reach his 17th ODI century, putting the perfect finishing touch to a 123-run partnership with Jimmy Neesham. \nTaylor also figured in a crucial 104-run partnership with skipper Kane Williamson, who departed for 69 off 75 balls midway through the 31st over. \nNeesham came to the wicket with the score on 166-4, and kept the run rate ticking over as he notched his third ODI half-century in a 57-ball 71. \nThe third ODI is at Westpac Stadium in Wellington on Friday.
