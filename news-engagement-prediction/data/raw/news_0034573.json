Do not worry John, it is not you, it is just your complete lack of Polynesian heritage. SUPPLIED \nMarried at First Sight couple: Scarlett and Michael \nAfter careful consideration and several more insults from Debbie, John decides it might be a good idea to move apartments to get out of Debbie's hair. Ad Feedback \nThis sends her into a toddler-sized meltdown and she storms off into the Samoan rainforest. \"Why did we even do all that Polynesian theme if there was no Polynesian? All they had to do was put an ad out and they would have got them... I got nothing I wanted, I got an orange cake, it wasn't even gluten free.\" \nOver in God's own, Cheryl and Johnathan settle into chilly Queenstown. SUPPLIED \nMarried at First Sight couple: Sharon and Nick \nJohnathan manages to upstage every date Cheryl has ever had by taking her somewhere other than McDonald's. \nCheryl gushes about Johnathan and his romantic gestures which promptly come to a halt a few days later when Cheryl tells Johnathan: \"I feel like you're not the ugliest thing I've ever seen\". \nI am not taking sides but if my spouse told me that on our honeymoon, I would be on my way to the nearest court to get an annulment. SUPPLIED \nRunaway Bride Lauren and her now ex-husband Andrew. \nStill in sunny Australia, farmer Sean and his wife Susan continue to be the cutest couple ever to grace Married at First Sight screens. \nSean adores his wife of ten minutes telling her she is stunning. \"Say that again,\" said Susan as the two gaze longingly into each others eyes giving me hope that someone may actually make it through this experiment. \nAlso in Australia are real-life Barbie and stripper Michael. It proceeds to take Michael almost the entire episode to drop the 'S' bomb on his unsuspecting wife. \nUnusually Scarlett takes the news like a champ, \"I'm not a quitter, I'm not a person that gives up on people.\" \nHowever it appears Michael is in fact a quitter after 'friend-zoning' his wife after he finds out Scarlett might not be willing to relocate for love. \nTwin Sharon and husband Nick were still as giggly as school kids as they jetted off to Koh Samui, Thailand. \nThe novelty of attraction at first sight lasted almost the whole episode with the couple discussing having children but only a few days after meeting each other. \nIt wasn't until Nick found out Sharon had cheated on a partner in the past that Nick revealed being a cheater was a deal-breaker for him, leaving the almost-ideal relationship up in the air. \nAlene and Simon, Nadia and Anthony, Vanessa and Andy and twin Michelle and Jesse all took the back-seat in this episode despite also having gone on their honeymoons. \nAll four couples appeared to be having a nice time on their holidays but lacked enough love/drama to warrant giving them more than a minute of screen time. \nPerhaps most importantly of all, this episode we were able to find out what happened to runaway bride Lauren. \n\"This is a first ever for Married at First Sight, where the wedding hasn't worked out on the first night,\" said expert John Aiken. \nJilted husband Andrew said \"I don't necessarily need an apology but an explanation might be good. You and everyone else buddy. \nLauren appears giggly as if she was trying to laugh the awkwardness of the whole situation away. \nThe couple then proceed to have an open and very adult conversation about what caused Lauren to flee. \nThe runaway bride admits she freaked out and decided she had to put her son first. \nShe then went on to list a bunch of reasons that indicate she should have never signed up for this experiment in the first place. \nAfter Andrew reveals he cannot give Lauren a second chance, the two part ways amicably. \nThis officially marks the end of the first marriage, even shorter than that of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T15:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:42:21.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
