Roel Obusan. \nObusan arrived at the Senate early Friday morning and went directly to Balajadia’s office while some of the arresting team spent the night also in the same office. ADVERTISEMENT READ: Agreement: De Lima will be arrested at 10 a.m. Friday \nThe arrest order, issued by the Muntinlupa Regional Trial Court, should have been served to the senator Thursday but she requested that she be allowed to spend the night with her family. \nBefore 8 p.m. Thursday, De Lima went home but rushed back to the Senate after hearing reports that the CIDG team would serve the arrest warrant at her house in Paranaque City. \nDe Lima said she was ready to voluntarily surrender but expressed hope that it would be done during daytime because she felt“less safe” if it is done at night. \nShe said she also chose to be at the Senate when the arrest order is served on her because she did not want her family to see her being arrested at her home. \nThe senator had repeatedly expressed her readiness to be jailed while denying all allegations hurled at her. \n“I have long prepared myself to be the first political prisoner under this regime, because the criminal charges and prosecution are nothing less than a politically motivated act by the Duterte regime to clamp down on any vocal opposition against its support for a policy of EJK in dealing with suspected criminals,” De Lima said when the charges were filed in court last February 17. \n“If the loss of my freedom is the price I have to pay for standing up against the butchery of the Duterte regime, then it is a price I am willing to pay. But they are mistaken if they think my fight ends here. It has only begun,” she added.
