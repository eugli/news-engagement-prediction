Adelaide's wild weather in 2016: May – Storm surges September/October – Severe storms, tornadoes, blackouts, flooding November – Severe storm, hail December – Record rainfall, flooding, blackouts \nSevere thunderstorms and rainfall brought widespread flooding , multiple power outages anda century record-breaking annual rainfall of 1790.6mm at Uraidla in the Adelaide Hills. \nSignificant storm surges destroyed jetties in the Gulf St Vincent and the Spencer Gulf in May. \nStorm cells tore roofs from houses in McLaren Vale and the Adelaide Hills and brought the state's power system to its knees in September and October. \nSo what has caused this spate of wild weather? Meet the Indian Ocean Dipole \nBureau of Meteorologist senior climatologist Darren Ray said the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) was a huge influence. \nThe IOD is the phenomenon created by the difference in sea temperatures between the east and west of the tropical Indian Ocean, and reached a record strength in 2016. \n\"The ocean temperatures have been very warm and we have seen lots of moisture pumped into the atmosphere,\" Mr Ray said. \n\"This summer, the tropics have been really quite active.\" \nSo why does weather at the northern reaches of Australia affect what happens at the other end of the country? \nWeather systems in the Great Australian Bight draw moisture from both the tropics and the Antarctic regions, Mr Ray explained. \n\"There's a pretty good chance that we will have the wettest summer since 2010,\" he added. \n\"It actually could have a pretty good go at being the wettest summer on record for Adelaide.\" Is it climate change? \nMr Ray said that in his opinion, recent global weather satellite data showed climate change was happening and was heavily responsible for recent weather spikes. \n\"We are seeing warming trends, rising sea level, warming oceans,\" he said. \nMr Ray said he believed climate change was increasing the severity of naturally occurring weather events — creating greater extremities in storms, rainfall and winds. \nLast year's IOD was enhanced by record ocean temperatures around northern Australia, Mr Ray said. \nMr Ray said when the IOD combined with a very strong low pressure system in South Australia in May, unexpected wild weather was the result. \n\"Those storm surges were at record levels,\" he said. \nMeanwhile, regular rainfall through May, June, July and August resulted in saturated soil levels and flooding during September and October.

(ABC News: Tom Fedorowytsch) \nAs for this summer so far, Mr Ray said: \"Temperatures have been quite spikey and we have seen slightly above average numbers of hot days this summer. But [overall] it has been a little bit cooler and milder than this time last year.\" Future rain events \nMr Ray said the IOD also influenced the noticeable increase in severe, localised storm activity. \n\"We saw that reflected in a really high number of intense low pressure systems and cold fronts producing conditions that were windier than usual,\" he said. \nMr Ray said direct observational evidence from satellite weather stations showed an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \nAs a result, in the future, the tropics zone will broaden and provide less frequent but heavier rain events for Adelaide. \n\"Things will continue to get warmer, with more temperature extremes,\" Mr Ray said. \n\"When we do get significant rainfall, it will come more intensely and we are starting to see some indications of that being the case.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:56:49.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
