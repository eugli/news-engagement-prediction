Molly, a five-year-old terrier cross, was diagnosed with a third-degree cardiac block that caused her heart to beat too slowly – a condition that was gradually killing her. News of her plight clearly touched people’s hearts because when the RSPCA appealed this month for donations for a life-saving operation, the cash was raised in only three hours. Molly was fitted with the device in a two-hour operation by Chris Linney, head of cardiology at Willows Veterinary Centre in Solihull, and is recovering at the RSPCA kennels in Coventry. Mr Linney said: ‘Molly’s story has really captured people’s imagination. It’s a fairly uncommon procedure to fit a dog with a pacemaker.
