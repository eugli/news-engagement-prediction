But one person was a little down. When asked what living in a dorm meant to her, Jeon Somi seemed to get lost in her thoughts before her expression became more subdued. \nAfter a moment, the idol said, “[After I.O.I disbanded], I would wake up and the others weren’t there anymore.” It seems Jeon Somi had a hard time adjusting to life without the other I.O.I members, and it was evident in the way she talked about dorm life in general. \nHopefully, she’ll have a great time and make new memories sharing a dorm with the other members of “Sister’s Slam Dunk Season 2”! \nKeep up with the latest episode below.
