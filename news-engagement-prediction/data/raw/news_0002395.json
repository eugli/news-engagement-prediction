According to the same source, the base model of Samsung’s upcoming Android flagship will feature 64GB of internal storage, while the premium variant will ship with 128GB of storage space. It’s unclear whether this rumor applies to both the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus, or whether the base model with less RAM and storage space will also be the one that features a smaller display, while 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage will be reserved for the larger variant. However, the source indicates that both models will feature LPDDR4X RAM, adding that China and South Korea might get a device that’s “a little different.” \nThis latest turn of events seemingly suggests that the Galaxy S8 won’t feature 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage like some previous leaks implied. However, the same insider at least revealed that the better variant of the device will allegedly ship worldwide, while SamMobile’s sources are saying the opposite, claiming that only the base model will be available in North America and Europe. Finally, when one Twitter user asked the insider to comment on a recent rumor suggesting that the Galaxy S8 Plus will sport a 3,750mAh battery , they had no useful information to provide. While these latest leaks are contradictory to a certain degree, they still agree on one thing – Samsung is apparently improving the base model of its next Android flagship. The cheaper variant of the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge featured 32GB of built-in storage, but that apparently won’t be the case with the company’s upcoming phone. \nOther recent rumors suggest that both variants of the device will ship with curved screens and feature Bixby, a digital assistant developed by an AI startup Viv which Samsung acquired in October. The South Korean tech giant is also reportedly working on Samsung Desktop Experience (DeX), a phone-to-PC solution centered around a smart dock and the Galaxy S8. More information about the device will likely follow soon as the Galaxy S8 is rumored to be unveiled on March 29 before hitting the shelves in April.
