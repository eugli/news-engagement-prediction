The money will benefit the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, the Tahirih Justice Center, the National Immigration Law Center and the International Rescue Committee, organizations that provide aid to immigrants and refugees. \nThe sold-out “City of Immigrants: A Night of Support” had raised around $40,000 online by 8:15 p.m., and by 9 p.m., it had raised around $50,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:26:42.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
