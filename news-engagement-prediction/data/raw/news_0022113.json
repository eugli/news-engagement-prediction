This is the kind of application that takes online chatting to a whole new level and this can be seen from the first minute of using it. Create a personalized 3D avatar Installing IMVU is not at all difficult, and, just like itâ€™s the case of instant messaging applications in general, an account is required in order to use IMVU, but third-party accounts can also be used (such as Facebook, Yahoo, a Google account or even Twitter) so users do not necessarily need to create a new one. Once they have logged in, a whole new dimension opens to them. They have to create a 3D avatar that will require a lot of customization before actually chatting over the Internet. Some clothes need to be picked, maybe some make-up, some accessories, and complete sets of offers to earn credits that can be spent on a large variety of items. Connect with people from around the world Once users enter a chatroom, they experience a different type of chatting. It is a 3D room, that gives you the possibility to have your character placed in various fixed locations. One's avatar can also perform a wide range of actions, thus making the interaction more interesting and realistic. Chat rooms can also be created, thus offering users more control over the guests they start conversations with. IMVU also comes with a contact list, just like any regular instant messenger, so friends can be added as well as other favorite users for a quicker and a bit more private chat. Recent encounters are also displayed to easily find others you enjoy interacting with. In conclusion To sum up, IMVU is a great application for those who have a lot of free time and want to have fun, as it is quite far from what one would expect a regular IM to be. Even if it does not ensure a fast and simple chat experience, it is still worth taking for a spin.
