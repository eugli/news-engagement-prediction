Time for another Kent State perhaps. One bullet stops a lot of thuggery,” he posted Thursday, according to screenshots saved by the Michigan Democratic Party . \nAmong his Facebook posts was one that said, “I’m thinking another Kent State might be the only solution.” — Dustin. (@dtc2150) January 20, 2017 \nThe rural Republican, who regularly posts songs blasting liberals and praising President Trump, was soon criticized for seemingly encouraging violence. \nFour unarmed Kent State University students were shot and killed by the Ohio National Guard in May 1970, which was called to campus amid nationwide protests against Richard Nixon’s decision to invade Cambodia. \nThe tragic incident, where guardsmen opened fire on a crowd of demonstrators where objects had been thrown, was seared into America’s consciousness with painful images of grieving students. Adamini has since said that he was not calling for violence. (www.intherightmind.net) \nAdamini had removed most of his posts by Friday, and said that his intent “was to try to stop the violence, not encourage more.” \nHe said on Facebook that the Berkeley protests reminded him of Kent State, and added that “unless the protesters stop the violence, violence by police or national guard will be the result.” \nOthers did not believe that Adamini was advocating for peace in his original post. \n“There is no ambiguity or alternative interpretation. To call for “another Kent State” and declare that “one bullet stops a lot of thuggery” is to clearly and openly advocate for the murder of unarmed college students simply because they don’t share his beliefs or point of view,” the Michigan Democratic Party said.
