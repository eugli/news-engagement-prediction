Michael Gove latest Tory to slap down Sturgeon over 'futile' Brexit threats GROW UP! Michael Gove latest Tory to slap down Sturgeon over 'futile' Brexit threats NICOLA STURGEON and the SNP have been told to grow up and end threats of further independence referendums. PUBLISHED: 09:25, Fri, Feb 3, 2017 | UPDATED: 09:43, Fri, Feb 3, 2017 \nThe Scottish First Minister was recently accused of using “bully” language to try and force another vote on Scotland splitting from the UK, despite falling support for such an event. \nMichael Gove , leading Brexiteer and former Justice and Education Secretary, hit out at the SNP and accused the party of immaturity over its repeated whines over leaving the European Union . \nThe Scottish parliament will debate Article 50 next week, a move Mr Gove branded “futile”. \nSpeaking to BBC Good Morning Scotland , Mr Gove said: “Trying to suggest that a vote in the Scottish parliament is a way of exercising some sort of veto or sending a signal to the UK Government is not really grown up politics.” GETTY Michael Gove has moved to quash Nicola Sturgeon's Brexit demands \nMr Gove, who was born in Edinburgh, was asked if he feared another referendum on Scottish independence was on the cards. \n“No,” he said. “One of the most striking things since Britain vote to leave the EU has been the decline in support for a second referendum. \n“And opinion polls suggest support for independence has not risen, indeed in one or two cases it seems to have fallen. \n“So many people, including the SNP, thought that leaving the EU would precipitate a second referendum but quite the opposite. \n“The people of the UK have voted to leave one union that didn’t work, the people of Scotland are not going to vote to leave one that does work.” GETTY Michael Fallon recently said the SNP did not have the authority to trigger a second independence vot Trying to suggest that a vote in the Scottish parliament is a way of exercising some sort of veto or sending a signal to the UK Government is not really grown up politics Michael Gove \nStatistics recently published by the Scottish Government showed sales to other parts of Britain were with almost £50billion in 2015, while exports to the EU were worth just £12.3bn in comparison. \nScottish Secretary David Mundell said the figures showed the UK’s union is a “vital union for Scotland”. \nIn a clear warning to Ms Sturgeon and her band of Nationalists, he continued: “\"We know the Scottish Government's constant talk of a second independence referendum is creating damaging uncertainty for the Scottish economy,” said the minister. \n\"I again call on the First Minister to end that uncertainty by taking her threat of another referendum off the table and working with us to get the best deal for Scotland and the whole of the UK.\" \nKezia Dugdale added: “She added: \"These figures confirm that the UK single market is four times more important to Scottish jobs and the economy than the EU single market. \n\"It is simply a reckless Nationalist gamble to put access to the UK single market, and all the jobs that depend on it, at risk. That's why the SNP must drop plans for a second independence referendum.” \nOn Wednesday Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the SNP could “forget it” if they thought Westminster would sanction a second referendum. \nA spokesman for the Nicola Sturgeon responded: \"Any Tory bid to block a referendum would be a democratic outrage, but would only succeed in boosting support for both a referendum and for independence itself - something which the Prime Minister has previously indicated she understands all too well. \n\"Our mandate is unequivocal, with a manifesto commitment which makes explicitly clear that the Scottish Parliament should have the right to decide on an independence referendum if Scotland faces being taken out of the EU against our will. And no Tory Westminster Government has a right to stand in the way of that.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T11:47:01.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
