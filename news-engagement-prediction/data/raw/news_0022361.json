(Photo: ED REINKE, Associated Press) 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMike Davis left the Indiana basketball sideline more than a decade ago, and he still gets nervous thinking about coaching the Hoosiers. \n\"I was too naive then to see it and to understand,\" Davis said in a preview clip for \"A Taste of Coaching,\" a BTN show that debuts 9:30 p.m. Sunday. \"Now I look back and I get nervous, taking over for coach Knight.\" \nDavis, 56, was named the interim coach when Bob Knight was fired in September 2000 after 29 seasons. After one year, Davis was named the full-time coach and took the 2002 Hoosiers to the national championship game. He resigned after six seasons with a 115-79 record. \nDavis said that, to a degree, he knew he was in over his head but tried to overcome it. \n\"Coach Knight taught me a lot, but it was unbelievable because I wasn’t prepared,\" said Davis, who was an assistant under Knight for three seasons before taking over. \"I knew wasn’t prepared, but I was trying to walk out like I was prepared.\" \nAfter leaving IU, Davis coached Alabama-Birmingham for six seasons. He is in his fifth year at Texas Southern, where he believes he should have been coaching 15 years ago. \n\"(IU) should be your last job, not your first job,\" Davis said. \"I’m at Texas Southern now. It should’ve been Texas Southern, UAB, Indiana, not Indiana, UAB and Texas Southern. \n\"I look back now and I realize just how big it was, and it makes me nervous just thinking about it.\" \nFormer Purdue coach Gene Keady is also on the panel for that episode. \"I wasn't prepared. I knew I wasn't prepared.\"- Mike Davis, on being @IndianaMBB coach https://t.co/8ECfjmiZ8x — Big Ten Network (@BigTenNetwork) February 8, 2017 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:01:06.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
