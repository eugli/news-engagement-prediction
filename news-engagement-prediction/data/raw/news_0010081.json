(Santosh/HT Photo) \nPATNA: A special investigation team (SIT) of Patna police on Friday interrogated Bihar Staff Selection Commission (BSSC) chairman Sudhir Kumar to track the trail of question paper leak in the now cancelled intermediate-level examination to recruit clerks in various government departments. \n“The role of BSSC chairman is important in maintenance of confidentiality right from setting of question papers to its printing outside the state,” said an officer. \nAfter the interrogation, Kumar said he had provided whatever details the SIT had sought from him. \n“It was a preliminary examination. The questions are published under a system. There are many deficiencies in BSSC and I have apprised about it to top government officers and chief minister Nitish Kumar is also in the know of things,” he said, without elaborating further.

The racket came to light when handwritten answers of 127 out of 150 questions surfaced in public domain several hours before the first two phases of the examination were held on January 29 and February 5. \nThough the government has cancelled the examination of all the four phases after the preliminary probe report confirmed that the “sanctity of the exam had been compromised,” the SIT is yet to track the full trail of leak. \nMeanwhile, the SIT is planning to take action against BSSC secretary Parmeshwar Ram and AVN School proprietor Ramashish Singh under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. Both are currently lodged in jail in connection with the question paper leak.

But after I came to know about his activities, I completely disassociated myself from him. In fact, I had even approached then Bihar governor Buta Singh for probe into the alleged recruitment irregularities in the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC),” he said, adding the Patna police should make public the names of bigwigs whose involvement in the racket has been alleged by Ram during interrogation. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T15:50:14.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
