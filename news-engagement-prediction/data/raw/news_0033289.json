(Photo: ITV) \nBut is she telling the truth? Read More Emmerdale viewers 'heartbroken' as Laurel Potts puts dementia husband Ashley Thomas in care home \nSally Dexter, who plays Faith, told Digital Spy: \"Faith has had a bit of a health scare herself, which has put her life into perspective. She's come to the village because she wants to see her family again - she just wants to touch roots. (Photo: ITV) \n\"I think she will also do everything she can possibly think of to help Sarah. Some of the things will perhaps not be appropriate, but she does them anyway!\" \nWhile Faith does have good intentions, Sally warned that she will be \"causing havoc\" in the village. (Photo: ITV) \n\"She has no shame,\" the actress continued. \"She's completely unapologetic. If she's wrong, she'll 'fess up and say she's wrong. But that doesn't mean she won't necessarily go out and do it again! She has a good heart, though. She makes mistakes but she makes them honestly.\" \n*Emmerdale returns to ITV tomorrow at 7pm Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T20:02:48.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
