Saoura on Sunday in Enugu. \nThe defender in an exclusive chat, said, “It is our wish and resolve to make a name for ourselves and supporters of the club. After the game in Algeria, we now know much of how our opponents play and we shall counter them on Sunday to book a ticket for next round of the competition.” \nOn motivation from the club’ financiers, Enugu state government, the Akwa Ibom state born defender said, “Sure, we are being taken care off and we are motivated to deliver the goods on Sunday and further in the competition. I must say that all we need now is prayers and good will of all supporters of the club for us to overcome the challenges expected from the Algerians. With good luck on our side, there is no way we will fail. Our governor has been up to his duties as a father and he even called us before the game in Algeria to give us words of motivation that to a very large extent, saw us achieve the result we got in the first leg and he has promised us more goodies for us to deliver a victory on Sunday.” \nEtim also denied reports making the rounds that the players of RANGERS were begging for financial assistance from members of the public credited to him stressing, “I am not sure I made such a statement to any reporter. On our way back from Algeria, in Lagos, some reporters came and after talking with our coach, came to me and I only said that we need the prayers and full support of all Nigerians to overcome our opponents. Never did I say that we are lacking financial support from the government of Enugu state. I was simply mis-quoted.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T09:55:51.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
