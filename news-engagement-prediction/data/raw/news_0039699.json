Air Canada and WestJet also said they will participate. \nSafety protocols in Canada stand in marked contrast to those in the United States, where the Federal Aviation Administration regulates alcohol testing for U.S. airlines; their pilots and crew are subject to testing throughout their employment. \nTransport Canada, however only forbids flight crew from working within eight hours of consuming alcohol, but doesn’t mandate random testing. \nWith files from Global News’ Erika Tucker © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:25:43.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
