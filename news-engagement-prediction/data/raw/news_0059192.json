But he became a famously globetrotting CEO by also taking on responsibilities for running France's Renault. Recently, the alliance also picked up Japan's troubled Mitsubishi. \nGhosn will be replaced by Nissan's co-CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who has risen through the ranks at Nissan since joining the Japanese automaker in 1977. \nGhosn will continue as chairman of the board when the management change takes place April 1. He indicated as far back as 2012 that he planned to stay on as CEO for only five more years. Even now he says he plans to stay deeply involved. \n\"As Nissan's chairman, I will continue to supervise and guide the company, both independently and within the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi,\" Ghosn said in a statement. \"I am committed to supporting the alliance as it evolves and expands.\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lxeBDk NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.
