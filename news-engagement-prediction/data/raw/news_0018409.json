There is still no official word on whether Donald Trump plans to attend the 2017 White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, which is definitely happening despite the president’s combative relationship with the press. But it looks like finding an A-list performer for this event might not be so tough after all—that is, if Trump is willing to let Stephen Colbert emcee. Colbert fans might remember the comedian’s scathing roast of George W. Bush at 2006’s soirée—which brought a relatively unprecedented level of sarcasm to the usually congenial tradition. “Everyone who wasn’t in that room loved (the speech),” Colbert jokingly told Variety at a Montclair Film Festival fundraiser Saturday night. He added that “it would be an honor” to give the gig another go under President Trump—though he isn’t holding his breath for an invitation: “I’d love to do it [again]. I mean, when else are you going to stand next to the President and make jokes? But no one will ever ask again.” Trump in particular would be unlikely to welcome Colbert to the event, considering all of the times the Late Show host has blasted him on air—especially since the election. But this year’s gala already promises to be atypical: The New Yorker and Vanity Fair have already pulled out of parties linked to the event, and Samantha Bee will be hosting her own Trump roast on the very same night as the official dinner—an event that will almost certainly be more appealing to the majority of A-list comedians who want a chance to skewer the president. This leaves another team likely struggling to find an impressive, well-known entertainer to helm big, splashy Washington festivities based around Trump. That is, if the president even ends up attending an event devoted to an industry he has called the “ opposition party .” But hey, there’s always Jon Voight.
