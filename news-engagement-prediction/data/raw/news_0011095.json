CHRISTEL YARDLEY/FAIRFAX NZ \nSurf life savers were out in force across the across the country to help beach goers out of \"tricky situations\". \n\"It's a big sea, we could of zipped around here, there and everywhere.\" \nREAD MORE: \nA rescue helicopter spotted the woman's body several kilometres north of where she was swept away and Tinomana and Lowe pulled her out of the water. STACY SQUIRES/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe beginning of the Heaphy Track North of Karamea, near where a 70-year-old woman drowned after being swept out to sea by a surprise wave on Sunday. \nHe said the area was well known to locals for having rough water. \n\"It was a big swell, you gotta have respect for it. They used to have signs up; it's not the kind of beach you just go for a paddle in.\" \nHe understood the couple were tourists staying in Karamea, and had been travelling in a campervan around New Zealand. \nThe woman's death was one of seven over the long weekend as sweltering temperatures and clear skies saw beachgoers swarm to popular swimming spots. \nTwo women, four men and a 21-month-old boy died in water-related incidents across the country â€“ triple the number of people who drowned during Waitangi weekend last year. \nJust over a month into the year, New Zealand's annual water death toll has already reached 18. \nAn Auckland woman died on Monday after a group of four were swept down the Waikato River near Taupo. \nSergeant Shane McNally said a group of friends, aged in their early 20s, were swimming in the river when the Aratiatia Dam opened. \n\"Unfortunately the water has risen very rapidly and four people were swept away.\" \nThree made it to the riverbank, but the fourth person was found dead in one of the river's pools. \nOn Sunday, emergency services were called to remote Anaura Bay, near Tolaga Bay, when a man surfaced from a dive and collapsed. He was unable to be revived. \nIn Makarau, northwest of Auckland, a 21-month-old boy drowned in a swimming pool at a property. \nAn Auckland Westpac Rescue Helicopter spokeswoman said emergency services performed CPR on the young boy but were unable to revive him by the time the helicopter arrived. \nAlso on Sunday, a 30-year-old man died after he was found seriously injured at a beach in Eastbourne, Wellington. \nThe man's friends pulled him from the water and started CPR, but he died shortly after in hospital. \nFurther along the harbour, the body of a teenager who vanished in the rain-swollen Hutt River on Thursday washed up on the shores of Karaka Bay. The 19-year-old's body was spotted by a member of the public on Saturday morning. \nA man's body was found on Saturday after he went missing while diving at Dunedin's Sandfly Bay a day earlier. \n\"The diver was with a group and was the only one who didn't resurface,\" a police spokesperson said. \nWater Safety New Zealand chief executive Jonty Mills said incidents where the victim had no intention of being in the water remained the largest cause of drowning, followed by those who went for a swim. \nSurf Lifesaving New Zealand lifesaving and education manager Henry Lawson said Cantabrians finally got some summer weather over Waitangi weekend, and while the region's beaches were busy, people \"aren't getting into too much trouble\". \nHe had heard of a few incidents of people in Christchurch getting caught out near Sumner's Cave Rock, under the cliffs at Taylors Mistake and the New Brighton Pier. \nSwimmers should be aware of any natural or man-made objects jutting out from the water's edge, as that was where rips usually circulated, he said. \n\"The water looks the same as everywhere else but a few factors combine and people realise they aren't in the situation they want to be in,\" he said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T09:32:44.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
