Lavontay White | Photo courtesy Fox 32 \nThe 20-year-old pregnant woman, Lavontay’s aunt, was shot in the abdomen and taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, police said. Authorities initially said her baby would survive. \nBut on Friday, a family member said the woman, who was 4 months pregnant, had lost her unborn baby — a boy to be named Devonte Major, according to the family member. The family member, a sister of Lazarec Collins, asked that her identity be withheld. \nShe said the unborn baby was lost on Thursday evening. Neither the medical examiner’s office nor police could immediately confirm the fatality. \nThe mother remains at Mount Sinai. “She is doing good, ” the family member said. “She is out of ICU and in recovery.” \nFuneral services for Lavontay and Collins are set for Saturday, Feb. 25, at the Lawndale Christian Center at 3827 W. Ogden, with visitation at 11 a.m., according to the family member. \nA GoFundMe page has been set up help with funeral arrangements for Lavontay. \nChicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson has called his uncle, Collins, a “documented gang member,” saying, “We believe that this was a targeted shooting, so these people were looking for him.” \nThe Facebook video of the shooting was viewed more than 100,000 times in the three hours after the shooting. A $10,500 reward has been announced for information leading to an arrest in the case, but as of Friday afternoon, no one was in custody. \nSupt. Johnson repeated earlier calls for tougher gun laws to help abate the violence. “We just cannot afford to have our children shot down for something they had no involvement in,” he said.
