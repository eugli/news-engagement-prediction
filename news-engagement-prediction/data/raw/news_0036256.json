Coordinated in tandem with the fledgling African e-tailer, OXOSI , the room was full of the pulsating and sweat-inducing beats of a traditional West African drum band, aptly named The OXOSI Fuji Ambassadors. Between sips of wine and bites of Nigerian fare, the well-appointed guests were busy throwing dollar bills at the band’s accompanying dancers. Despite the raucous atmosphere, in a quiet corner of the space, Maki Oh’s designer, Amaka Osakwe, stressed to Vogue.com that her latest collection was a story not so much about revelry as the subtle dance of seduction. Osakwe explained that the collection was inspired by the middle-class women from her native city of Lagos, Nigeria, who pack themselves into the bright yellow danfo minibuses as they travel around town. Off to see a lover for a “casual encounter,” these women may be dressed down for their trip, but once they arrive, they reveal a veiled glamor underneath oversize denim and sweatshirts. Pointing to the ankle-length fire-engine red strapless dress from her collection, which featured a tie across the hip akin to a traditional Nigerian wrapper garment, she explains with a sly smile how, once the knot is unfurled, the dress is easily removable. “There’s a mix of different ideas of seduction here,” said Osakwe. “It’s a different type of sexy.” Photo: Courtesy of Maki Oh Motioning toward a pale pink three-piece short suit and an oversize color-block fur “robe,” Osakwe explained that this was a clever nod to “walk of shame” attire. “I’ve never seen a walk of shame in Lagos, because at 6:00 a.m., she’s showered, which is the inspiration for the towel fabric. Then she’s back out and she comes straight to work like nothing ever happened.” Celebrating everyday life in Lagos is Osakwe’s specialty. She draws on the colorful traditions of her fellow Lagosians to consistently create lavish designs that feel wildly ornate but refined, from pink metallic tinsel-laden floor-length gowns to sleek vinyl pants with hip-bone cut-outs. It’s an easy type of elegance that remains impactful. Osakwe said her collection is centered around an affirming celebration of Nigerian and African culture and black aesthetics. “I have come to a place where I honestly believe that all I can do is keep celebrating, forget the negativity,” she said. “If you’re happy to join us on this end of celebrating our culture, then welcome.” Despite the seductive, behind-closed-doors inspiration of this collection, some of its more colorful and splashy Yoruban adire -dyed pieces were actually designed with public fetes in mind. Osakwe said that Nigerian women always take a lot of time and care when getting ready for such events. “Makeup takes an hour,” Osakwe said. “Nigerian women have makeup artists and their own hairstylists. At least every Saturday you’re having a makeup artist come over—they also set up their studios on Saturdays and they have changing rooms.” When dressing for these extravagant affairs, Osakwe explained, really anything goes. But surely one of her own pieces—the black fringed trousers, say—would move beautifully on the dance floor.
