Rand Paul castigated the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, saying, “we’re very lucky John McCain’s not in charge.” \n“Everything that he says about the president is colored by his own personal dispute he’s got running with President Trump, and it should be taken with a grain of salt, because John McCain’s the guy who’s advocated for war everywhere,” Paul said on “This Week.” \nPaul added that if McCain were “in charge” the country would “be in perpetual war.” \n“If you look at the map, there’s probably at least six different countries where John McCain has advocated for us having boots on the ground,” said Paul, who noted that McCain supported the Iraq war. \nMcCain on “Meet The Press” had earlier compared Trump – with whom he’s long had myriad differences and squabbles – to a dictator. \n\"The first thing that dictators do is shut down the press,\" McCain said. “And I'm not saying that President Trump is trying to be a dictator. I'm just saying we need to learn the lessons of history.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:13:47.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
