That sh*t gotta go. \nWhite people, give your f*cking money, your f*cking house, your f*cking property, we need it f*cking all!” \nBut it was the relish with which the teacher instructed people to kill people that was the most chilling: \n“And we need to start killing people.” \nThat brought laughter from the crowd which then erupted into cheers as she continued her rant: \n“First off, we need to start killing the White House. The White House must die. The White House, your f*cking White House, your f*cking presidents, they must go! F*ck the White House! Your f*cking White House. ” \nAn individual in the crowd was cheered when she said, “Burn it!” \nThe woman told the crowd that she was a preschool teacher who worked “under white supremacy” in her job for “40 f*cking hours” a week. \nShe also had some eerie ideas on what to teach children: \n“I am a f*cking preschool teacher who’s going to f*cking (unintelligible). Teach your kids to throw that f*cking cop car in the garbage. That sh*t has got to go. That sh*t has got to go.” \nPeople who were commenting on the live-stream thought that instead of concern about Trump, the protestors should take a look at themselves. \nThis is a developing story.
