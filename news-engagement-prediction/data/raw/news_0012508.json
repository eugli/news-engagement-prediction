Next problem: You said you were going to take Joshua’s surname, Sasse, as: ‘Nobody wants to be Mr Minogue. It takes a very strong man to put themselves in that position and I fully appreciate that.’ And herein lies the issue. I know. My husband was called ‘Mr Jones’ by everyone from The Guardian to the dry cleaner. It’s emasculating. I’m sorry, too, that the picture of you sobbing, alone in a Sydney hotel cafe, was published last week when it was actually taken in November. Pictured: Kylie Minogue with Joshua Sasse Men might want to date us because teenage boys and grannies stop us for a selfie, and we are ushered into the front row at Dior, but underneath their awful beanies and baseball caps (early-onset male pattern baldness, methinks?) lurks a cauldron of resentment bubbling away, like the delicious dinners they never bother to prepare when we get home late, exhausted. Ultimately, they seek revenge. And the only thing their small brains can think of is to cheat on us with someone younger and far, far less fabulous. But please take heart. This newest split doesn’t reflect on your desirability at all. Just be thankful you hadn’t tied the knot, and arrived at your solicitor’s office to be told you will have to pay him maintenance for the rest of your life, never mind if he was the one who cheated on you, and never once paid the mortgage or the cleaner. Kylie on stage at the Liverpool Echo Arena And thank the Lord you never married Olivier Martinez, another young buck you loved and lost. I bumped into him once, in the lobby of the Carlton hotel in Cannes, and he’s pocket-size! Can you imagine how tiny your children would have been? I know, I know. You’re regretful you never had kids, and I am, too. I think this is why we choose younger, less successful men when we’ve stopped working long enough to come up for air: we want to mother them, tell them what to do. I will wager you would routinely ask Joshua whether or not he has brushed his tongue. Am I right? I will also wager you bought him expensive gifts: cashmere sweaters from N.Peal, a vintage Rolex watch made in the year he was born (not so vintage then, actually!), a car, driving lessons, luxury holidays. Oh dear, dear Kylie. Another BIG mistake. Treating your boyfriend like a cosseted lap dog only means one day he will turn around and bite you on that perfect posterior. Female wealth and success in a relationship is like cancer. You ignore it for ages, but then one day, suddenly, it’s too late. The only solution is to date your equal. An older, independent, wealthy man. Problem is, your equal wants a 20-year-old with the IQ of a snail. I should really hook you up with Madonna: you have an awful lot in common. And just one other thing: stop taking your beaus on to the red carpet. I took mine to the Baftas, and instead of him saying how nice it had been to meet Kenneth Branagh, he said, and I quote: ‘I felt like your bloody handbag, except rather less useful.’ We cannot win, we over-achieving older women. I understand, I really do. The world is your oyster, but you have no one to share it with. As Tracey Emin once said to me (and listen, this woman ended up marrying a rock. An actual stone): ‘I can go on holiday to Niagara Falls, but what is the point if there’s no one to turn to and say, “Wow!” ’ I share your pain.
