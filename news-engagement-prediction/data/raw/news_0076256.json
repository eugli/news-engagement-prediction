(Angels) By Maria Guardado and Adam McCalvy / MLB.com | + 0 COMMENTS \nTEMPE, Ariz. -- Yusmeiro Petit pitched two innings and Ben Revere produced an RBI single to help lead the Angels to a 2-0 win over the Brewers on Saturday afternoon at Tempe Diablo Stadium in the Cactus League opener for both teams. \nRevere opened the scoring by legging out an infield single off Brewers right-hander Joba Chamberlain to score Kaleb Cowart from third in the bottom of the third inning. Full Game Coverage \nRyan LaMarre made it 2-0 by lifting a sacrifice fly to knock in Eric Young Jr. in the seventh. \nPetit, Brooks Pounders , Jose Alvarez , Deolis Guerra , Kirby Yates , Cody Ege and Abel De Los Santos combined to shut out the Brewers, who were held to four hits. \nCarlos Torres was the lone Brewers pitcher to log more than one inning, racking up four strikeouts over two shutout frames. \nPetit, who is fighting for a spot in the Angels' rotation or bullpen after signing a Minor League deal with the club, allowed one hit and struck out two in the 19-pitch outing. The 32-year-old veteran is slated to represent Venezuela in the World Baseball Classic next month, alongside countrymen Alvarez and Guerra. \nAngels free-agent addition Luis Valbuena served as the designated hitter and went 0-for-2 with a walk. Andrelton Simmons , who will leave camp Tuesday to play for the Netherlands in the Classic, finished 0-for-3 with a strikeout and played five innings at shortstop. \nWHAT'S NEXT Brewers: Wily Peralta will start and newcomer Jett Bandy will catch when the Brewers host the Dodgers on Sunday in the first Cactus League game of the year at Maryvale Baseball Park. Peralta's first pitch is scheduled for 2:05 p.m. CT and the game will air live on MLB.TV and Fox Sports Wisconsin's Plus channel. \nAngels: Veteran right-hander Bud Norris , who signed a Minor League deal with the Angels in January, will get an early chance to make an impression in the fifth-starter competition when he faces the Athletics on Sunday at Hohokam Stadium. First pitch is scheduled for 12:05 p.m. PT, and the game can be seen live on MLB.TV and Fox Sports West. \nWatch every out-of-market regular-season game live on MLB.TV . covers the Angels for MLB.com. has covered the Brewers for MLB.com since 2001.
