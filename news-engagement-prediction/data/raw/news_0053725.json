We need more of this Credit: Alamy \nI t calculated that if the UK increases the number of homes it builds every year to 270,000 - which is higher than the Government's target of 200,000 yet below what some experts think is necessary to ease the housing crisis - more than 370,000 new workers will have to be employed. \nThe report also warned that if new recruits are not added to the workforce, the cost of building will shoot up. Carpenters and joiners are most needed, followed by plumbers, electricians, and bricklayers. \nThis calculation does not take into account any impact of lower immigration as a result of leaving the European Union. It found that if there is a 'hard' Brexit, such as the extension of the points-based immigration system currently in place for non-EU migrants, 215,000 fewer people from the EU will join the UK's construction industry by 2020. One in eight construction workers in the UK are foreign; in London that figure is 23pc. \nJames Bryce, director of workforce planning at Arcadis, said: “What we have is not a skills gap; it is a skills gulf. Systemic under-investment in the nation’s workforce has contributed to a reduction in UK productivity.

He has said that without any change, the workforce will decrease by 20-25pc in the next 10 years.
