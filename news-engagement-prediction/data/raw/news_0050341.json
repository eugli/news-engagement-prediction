We cannot extend visa if the government is not doing it,” the bench, also comprising Justices R Banumathi and Mohan M Shantanagoudar, said. \nRehman’s lawyer had pleaded to the bench that the government be asked to take a “compassionate view” in the matter as there was no adverse report against him or his wife. \nThe counsel had also argued that since Rehman is practising Sufism, there is a threat to him in Pakistan. \nThe apex court did not accept the contentions and said it was for the government to take such a decision. \nHis counsel had also contended that Rehman should be granted time to make a representation before the government in the matter but the bench said, “We cannot allow it.” \nSolicitor General Ranjit Kumar, representing the Centre, opposed the plea and told the bench that the couple had given an undertaking before the high court that they would leave India. \nThe couple have been staying in India since October 2010. \nThe high court had dismissed their plea against last year’s order of Mumbai’s foreigner regional registration officer who had refused to extend their visa. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:13:28.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
