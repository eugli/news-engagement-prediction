Slot to 247Sports Links \nDuke pulled out a 72-64 win over Pittsburgh in Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski's return from back surgery, but a postgame question from a reporter ended with the coach taking a subtle jab at President Donald Trump. \nKrzyzewski was asked about how he handled his absence, which led to him bringing up the report that he had banned players from the locker room during his hiatus. Krzyzewski inferred that it was blown out of proportion on Twitter, and his lengthy comment turned into a subtle shot at Trump. \n\"We live in a Twitter world, Krzyzewski said, per WRAL-TV's Jared Fialko . \"Leaders don't lead that way...I hope they don't...I know one uses Twitter a lot.\" \nThe president has become known for his daily tweets each morning. Trump was a heavy user of Twitter throughout his campaign, and while some thought he might ramp them down once he assumed office, that certainly hasn't happened. \nIt looks like Krzyzewski isn't a fan of Trump's Twitter habit.
