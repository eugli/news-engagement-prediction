According to senior officials at the MHRD, the ministry is holding regular meetings with CBSE and NCERT. \n\n\"The government is trying to ensure that there is adequate number of NCERT books so that students and parents are not forced to go for expensive private textbooks due to artificial scarcity. This is to check on the nexus of private publishers and schools,\" said the official. \n\n\"There used to be a lot of complaints earlier as there was scarcity of these books,\" the official added. \n\nThe CBSE chairman has ordered that a committee periodically reviews various textbooks. \n\nAccording to a senior board official, CBSE will continue with the recommended list of books by private publishers for courses that are not published by NCERT, such as computer science.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:17:06.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
