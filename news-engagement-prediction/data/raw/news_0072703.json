And stop @'ing me about taking less money. You take less money and your job? All of you take a pay cut hahaha. \n‚Äî Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 22, 2017 \nBennett also characterized the reporting on his impending free agency decision as ‚Äú irresponsible ‚Äù speculation and dismissed a Twitter user‚Äôs accusation that he was basking in the attention.

With fellow tight end Rob Gronkowski sidelined due to injury, the newcomer also played a key role in the team‚Äôs Super Bowl run. \nNFL.com‚Äôs Ian Rapoport reported Tuesday that it was a ‚Äúreal possibility‚Äù that Bennett leaves the Patriots this offseason, as the team is unwilling to pay him a salary over Gronkowski‚Äôs $9 million annual figure. Bennett reportedly made just over $5 million this past season. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:21:40.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
