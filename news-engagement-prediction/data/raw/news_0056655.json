After the 2016 edition of the festival, a crew member posted a critical blog post on the 80s band's website, denouncing the band's treatment. The post was later removed.\nNew to Rockfest this year are a tattoo convention and a gourmet food zone.\nTickets are currently on sale at the festival website .\nMembers of the Wu-Tang Clan perform at the 2013 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Calif. They'll join heavy metal and rock acts on the bill at this year's Montebello Rockfest.
