Related Melissa McCarthy Developing Comedy at Fox \nThe pilot was co-written by Jim Cashman and Mitch Silpa, who will both serve as co-executive producers on the 30-minute, single-cam comedy. Warner Bros. Television is the studio. \nThe project marks the first TV series created by Cashman and Silpa, who are actors and writers who have ties to McCarthy — both have had small roles in her movies “The Boss,” “Bridesmaids,” “Spy” and “The Heat.” \nFor McCarthy and Falcone, the pilot is the second TV project for the husband-and-wife producing duo, who are behind TV Land’s “Nobodies,” which was recently greenlit for a second season .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:35:17.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
