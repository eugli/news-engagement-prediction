Her boyfriend Pete Wicks also gets involved as he tries to defend Megan and ends up facing off against Gatsby himself. Megan and Pete are loved up again this series (Photo: ITV) Lockie and girlfriend Yasmin (Photo: ITV Picture Desk) \nIt’s all pretty awkward for Amber T who actually HAS a boyfriend and has to explain to him just what is going on. \nMeanwhile, following Danielle Armstrong’s departure from TOWIE at Christmas, her ex James ‘Lockie’ Lock is back with a new girlfriend, Yazmin, who makes her show debut. \nAnd we’ll FINALLY get the reason for Gemma Collins ’ mysterious hospitalisation while in Tenerife; she shared photos of herself in January with a drip in her hand but no explanation why. \n*TOWIE returns Sunday at 10pm on ITVBe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T18:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:32:56.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
