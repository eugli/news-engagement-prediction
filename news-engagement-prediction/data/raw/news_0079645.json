Follow our live commentary on the 89th Academy Awards. FEB. 26, 2017 Reporter 7:53 PM ET \nWill they be celebrating “La La Land” in the city of stars tonight, or is it time for “Moonlight” to shine? We’ll find out soon as the 89th Academy Awards get underway, and we’ll be here to comment and complain throughout the evening. I’m Dave Itzkoff, a culture reporter for The New York Times. I’m joined by Wesley Morris, critic-at-large, and Melena Ryzik, a fellow reporter and awards-season veteran. Wesley Morris Critic 8:07 PM ET \nThanks for joining us, everybody. Who knows what’s going to happen tonight that we don’t already know is going to happen? Will the “La La Land” Express run through the best actor category and take Ryan Gosling with it? Odds feel low, but high for Casey Affleck or maybe — maybe! — Denzel Washington. Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:07 PM ET \nHello! Dave, can we comment, complain and commend? To veteran awards-watchers, the winners this season seem more pre-ordained than usual, but you can always count on at least one big upset. I’d look for it in the best actor/supporting actor categories. Though “La La Land” has the lion’s share of nominations, it could still be a banner night for African-American contenders — not that it would take much to break those records. Wesley Morris Critic 8:08 PM ET \nWell, just to say a little more about the racial politics here. The Academy might be off the hook this year. But, look, as far as I can see, there’s barely anything coming up later this year that’s keeping Hollywood from a redux of last year’s show. So, hey Universal, y'all better get that campaign rolling for Jordan Peele. #GetOut2018BestPicture Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:09 PM ET \nWith recent changes to its membership, the Academy is longing to put #OscarsSoWhite behind them. But this year, of course, the question is not if the show will be political, but how political it will be - even if viewing audiences are tuning in for a palate-cleanser. The Oscars can be a cultural distraction, no doubt. Though when the choices boil down to fabulism (“La La Land”), realism (“Moonlight”) or long-overdue historicism (“Hidden Figures”), it still feels like we’re part of the political conversation — whether the President tweets about it or not. Wesley Morris Critic 8:11 PM ET \nAnd what about Jimmy Kimmel, who’s hosted everything except my birthday party? What’ll he bring to a night whose political climate practically makes it impossible for winners to win with denouncing that climate? It’s going to be exciting. It’s also gonna be weird. But we’ll get through it together! Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:14 PM ET \nNo irony here - I thought Nick Kroll and John Mulaney had a killer opening monologue at the Independent Spirit Awards last night. Jimmy Kimmel has his work cut out for him. Patrick Healy ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:56:35.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
