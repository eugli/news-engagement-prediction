That's pretty much what struck me and what keeps popping up in my mind.\"\nMartin Robin says he had a Facebook conversation with Bissonnette the night before the shooting. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)\nRobin showed CBC News his Facebook account and an exchange with someone called Alexandre Bissonnette. Only Robin's side of the conversation is visible.\nBissonnette's side reads: \"This message has been temporarily suppressed because the account of the sender requires verification.\"\nA Facebook account that is believed to have belonged to Bissonnette was removed from the social networking site just hours before he was formally charged on Monday. \nIn response to Bissonnette's alleged comments, Robin said he told his friend that he was \"crazy.\"\nMet police investigators Since Sunday's shooting, Robin has met with investigators from the Quebec provincial police and RCMP. He said they were seeking to find out if the suspect had received any support carrying out the attack. \n\n\n\n\n\"He had no help of any organization. Of that, I'm 100 per cent certain,\" Robin said of Bissonnette's alleged involvement. \nLegal observers have speculated that ties to an organization are a necessary condition for laying terrorism-related charges, which Bissonnette is not facing, so far.\nWhy accused in Quebec City mosque shooting isn't likely to face terrorism charges \nRobin also said he is good friends with Bissonnette's twin brother, Mathieu. The twins lived together in a Sainte-Foy apartment not far from the mosque Alexandre is accused of attacking. \nRobin said he also had a Facebook exchange with Mathieu Bissonnette on the weekend of the shooting. \nThis image from Robin's Facebook account is part of his exchange with Bissonnette. The text highlighted in yellow reads, in French: 'This message has been temporarily suppressed because the account of the sender requires verification.' (Jonathan Montpetit)\nThey, too, discussed Trump's travel ban. Their exchange took place on Sunday night.\nAs the news began to circulate, Robin asked Mathieu if he had heard about the shooting, given the proximity of the mosque to his apartment.\nRead more about the victims of  Quebec City mosque attack \n\"Yes, I saw it on the news,\" Mathieu Bissonnette replied. \"But it's not in front of my place. It's all quiet here.\"\nLater that night, Mathieu asked Robin if police knew \"who committed the crime.\" When it emerged the following day that Mathieu's brother had been arrested, Robin wrote to offer his support. \nMathieu did not reply. Robin said he has not heard from him since Sunday night.\nFollow CBC News coverage of the Quebec City mosque attack \n\n\n\n\nWith files from Alison Northcott", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:55:40.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
