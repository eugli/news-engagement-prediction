Stone had just made a pass in the Winnipeg zone when Trouba hit him with an open-ice elbow to the head. \nStone did not return to the game but has travelled with the Senators for their upcoming road trip. Trouba was assessed a minor penalty for illegal check to the head on the play. \nA first-time offender, Trouba will forfeit US$33,333.34 in salary. \nHe will miss Winnipeg’s games Tuesday in Toronto and Feb. 28 at home to Minnesota. He will be eligible to return when Winnipeg hosts St. Louis on March 3.
