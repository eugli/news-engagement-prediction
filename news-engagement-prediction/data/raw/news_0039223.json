However, he’s teased fans by revealing on his personal Instagram page that he has a ‘big announcement’ to make soon. \nIn the first part of Carrick’s Instagram story, the midfielder wrote: ‘Filming today for a big announcement coming soon!!’ \nOne of the following photos had the caption: ‘Such a privilege to play for Manchester United’. \nThough it’s unconfirmed at this stage, the announcement could well be that Carrick is set to be handed a testimonial at Old Trafford at the end of this season. \nThe midfielder is expected to be granted a testimonial after serving longer than ten years at the club.
