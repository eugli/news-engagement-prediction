Maalim recently defected from Raila Odinga's ODM to Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper party. \nAlthough National Super Alliance (NASA) leaders have shown unity in Nairobi and at other high profile meetings, the same was not the case when Raila held a rally in Garissa last week. \nProminent leaders allied to Wiper party from the county were conspicuously absent from the rally. \nAmong those who did not show up was Maalim, who is considered to be NASA's top point man by virtue of his position as the deputy party leader and Shukran Gure the Garissa County woman rep.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:18:38.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
