Do you not understand?'\nMs Khan tells the woman she was born in New Zealand and has a right to be in the country, but that only seems to incense her further.\nMehpara Khan, 28, filmed as she and her friends were racially abused at a highway rest stop over the weekend\n'F*** off, I don't care if you were born here, you don't have the right to be here,' the woman shouts back.\n'I was born here, I own this f***ing place now get the f*** off, you ugly f***ing Muslim b****.'\nShe can then be seen taking a swing at Ms Khan while she records, and throwing more beers at the group before storming off behind a building.\nMs Khan said she was motivated to film the altercation after also being racially abused in a McDonalds back in 2015.\nAt the time she did nothing about it, saying she felt 'terrible' afterward, and vowed not to let anyone get away with it again.\nMs Khan took the footage to Huntly Police, who then arrested and charged the 27-year-old. She was due in court on Monday, TVNZ reported.\nA woman can be seen calling Ms Khan an 'ugly f***ing Muslim b****' while throwing cans of beer and trying to hit members of the group\nThe footage was also posted online where it has been viewed more than 90,000 times, leading to an outpouring of support for Ms Khan.\nSeveral rights groups, including the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand, also condemned the attack after viewing the footage.\nMs Khan added: '[The woman's] act of hate has lead to an outpouring of support on social media and that's way more powerful than the five minutes of hate that she tried to inflict.'", "external_links": ["https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/court-appearance-today-woman-accused-shocking-anti-muslim-racist-attack-in-huntly", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11799232", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-13T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:21:39.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
