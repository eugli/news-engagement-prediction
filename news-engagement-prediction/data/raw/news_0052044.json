But between the three cinematic universes that revolve around comic book characters and the plethora TV shows currently being produced, many critics are worried about \" superhero fatigue \". And then there's 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy , which made an insane amount of money while also challenging everything we thought we knew about superhero movies. And one of the ways that Guardians set itself apart from the rest of the MCU was its top notch soundtrack, through the use of Star-Lord's mixtape and walkman. But how did these tuns affect the rest of the team? \nCinemaBlend's Sean O'Connell was lucky enough to attend the set visit for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 . On the subject of the sequel's soundtrack, Marvel president Kevin Feige revealed how the group as a whole has embraced Star-Lord's particular taste in tunes. He said, \nThe other Guardians now know that music is a thing for Peter [Quill, Star-Lord], so in early scenes you see Baby Groot setting up these little outerspace speakers so that the music can play for all of them, because Quill likes to hear music when he's fighting. So, it does go to more than just his headset. \nLooks like Peter Quill isn't going to be the only one jamming out when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 finally hits theaters. Instead, the team as a whole will also listen as they attempt various intergalactic missions. \nHaving the Guardians collectively listen to Star-Lord' s tunes is sure to create some delightful moments in the sequel. Smart money is one a fantastic opening battle, likely the very one we've seen so much footage of in the early trailers. While battling those scary space octopi, they can also unite their attacks by synchronizing them to Awesome Mix Vol. 2. \nAnd perhaps even more exciting is the idea that Baby Groot is in on the joke. Vin Diesel's scene stealing anthropomorphic tree already busted out some sweet dance moves in the final moments of the first Guardians of the Galaxy ; now that he's bigger and they have more powerful speakers I can't wait to see what the little weirdo does. \nEarly statements by James Gunn indicate that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 's soundtrack will be pretty unique from its predecessor. While the first mix tape was chock full of hits that everyone knows, the second installment will feature a more diverse mix of songs. Maybe the reason for this mixed back is because Gamora, Groot, and Drax got a say in the team's tuneage. Plus, who knows what kind of trippy crap Mantis will bring into the equtation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:18:52.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
