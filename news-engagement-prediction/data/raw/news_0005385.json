I want to help the team because I’m the one with experience here. Hopefully, I can impart to them what I learned from my other teams before.” \nSedurifa, a reserve for Meralco last season, hasn’t been gun-shy at all in Batangas, leading the team in points with 20 markers through three games. He posted 17 points, 10 rebounds, and five assists in the squad’s recent conquest. \nThough elated with his recent offensive outbursts, the former CEU standout is hopeful that his teammates can also find their groove as Batangas seeks to rack up more wins this conference. \n“It feels so good to win. We’re just enjoying the games. We’re thankful that we got our first win so we’re really inspired to play. We just have to continue playing regardless of our opponents. We just have to sustain our process so we can improve.” \nBatangas will next face Racal on Monday at JCSGO Gym in Cubao.
