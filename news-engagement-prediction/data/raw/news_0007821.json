Specifically, the company had found some of the fuel debris associated with the failure of Reactor #2 at the bottom of the reactor’s containment vessel. Locating the reactor’s damaged fuel is critical to the clean-up effort. \nWhat the company ultimately discovered, however, is that the amount of radiation pouring off the damaged reactor below the RPV is vastly higher than had previously been communicated. Previous measurements of the radiation inside the containment vessel had pointed to an exposure level of 73 sieverts per hour. \nOne thing I want to note at this point is that these findings are being misreported across the internet as evidence that Fukushima’s radiation output is “spiking” or “soaring.” This is not the case. The radiation levels within Reactor #2’s containment vessel have been largely unknown for years, due to the difficulty of getting proper readings from remote equipment in the first place. The entire reason that Tepco used muon tomography to examine the interior of both Reactor #1 and Reactor #2 was because they didn’t have another means of identifying where fuel was inside the reactors. The 72 sievert metric is mentioned in reports dating back to 2012 — I’m not sure when or how Tepco measured it, but implying that this is a sudden unexpected problem is simply inaccurate. \nThat said, 530 sieverts is a great deal of radiation. One sievert is the maximum amount of radiation exposure that NASA allows for astronauts over their entire lifetime. And it’s clear that Tepco didn’t expect this problem — the company has been working on a robot that it could use to directly examine the containment vessel in much greater depth, proclaiming that the radiation-hardened robot would withstand a dose of 1,000 sieverts. If you assume a 73 sievert per hour dose, that gives the device nearly 14 hours of useful life. (A Japan Times report from 2012 indicates that even this much radiation is difficult to harden against). A composite photo of the metal grate and the hole in it, directly below the Reactor Pressure Vessel. \nAt 530 sieverts, that same robot wouldn’t even last two hours, and the distortions to its cameras and capabilities would be severe. The 530 sievert dose isn’t a direct measurement, it’s an analysis based on how much distortion was visible over a remote camera feed during the investigation this week. There’s also a 6.5-foot hole in a metal grate underneath the reactor pressure vessel. The condition of Reactor #2 \nOver at Reddit, nuclear engineer Hiddencamper has written about what happened at Fukushima Daiichi both immediately after the disaster and over the past few years. The bottom line is this — until now, Tepco has never been able to approach this area of the containment vessel because all earlier attempts to manually drive robots ended in failure long before the vehicles reached this point (as seen in the image below): \nLast summer, Tepco released the results of its muon tomography, showing that Reactor #2 still had a significant mass of material at the bottom of its reactor pressure vessel, or RPV. We already knew that the reactor had breached, because pressure inside the reactor fell after the initial disaster, without any action on the part of plant personnel. Nuclear reactors are an example of defense-in-depth, a strategy in which multiple types of defense mechanisms are used to limit the risk of various disasters. In this case, specifically, there is no evidence of a containment breach. The reactor pressure vessel leaked, but the containment vessel around the pressure vessel is not believed to have leaked (radioactive wastewater contamination is a separate issue from unshielded nuclear fuel). \nUnless the muon tomography was wrong, most of the mass of fuel is still within the reactor. Hiddencamper notes that “Unshielded spent nuclear fuel can produce over 1 million Rem per hour on contact (10000 Sv) the year after its removed from the reactor. This decays over time naturally.” \nHe continues: “The hole isn’t new. This is the first time they’ve gotten into the undervessel area. That hole has been there and these are expected dose rates for unshielded fuel. There is no evidence of a reaction for several reasons. One of which is tepco has been monitoring the gaseous fission product levels and there has been no change indicative of a critical reaction.” \nThat said, there is still a significant problem here. Previously, Tepco was expecting to find a 37 sievert problem. The sheer amount of radioactivity in this area will complicate cleanup and debris disposal, particularly if we can’t use robots to help with the most dangerous parts (humans are an even worse idea, given our unfortunate tendency to total biological failure). Despite how it’s being reported, this isn’t some brand-new crisis or failure, but it’s going to make life more difficult and expensive for those attempting to clean up the mess.
