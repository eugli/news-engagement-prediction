And immigration officer will have the authority to deem a migrant to be \"a risk to public safety or national security\". SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link There is a proposal to revive a much criticised scheme that sees local police recruited as US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Photo: AP \nTime and distance used to mean something in immigration law, but not any more. \nUnder Obama, a migrant apprehended within two weeks of arriving in the country and within 160 kilometres of the border was eligible for \"expedited removal\" from the country – by which they were denied an appearance in an immigration court. \nUnder Trump's deal, that time factor becomes two years and there is no distance-from-the-border requirement. \nAnd there'll be no more of the Obama-era nonsense of allowing those who have been arrested to live in the community while waiting for as long as a year for their case to emerge from the backlog in the immigration courts. From here in they will be detained, and maybe that means even more job creation for detention centre staff. \nEarly drafts of the plan included a call to mobilise the National Guard to round up migrants. But the only extra help for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, aptly abbreviated to ICE, is a proposal to revive an abandoned and much criticised scheme by which the agency recruits local police to double as ICE agents. \nMigration advocates warned that the new arrangement would go the same way as Trump's controversial migration crackdown, which blocked migrants and refugees from seven majority Muslim countries. That order is now on hold pending further litigation, but the administration reportedly is planning this week to wheel out a new version of the order that will be tailored to accommodate some of the legal criticism of its earlier iteration. \nSpeaking of the new deportation regime, Omar Jadwat who directs the ACLU's immigrants' rights project, told reporters: \"These memos confirm that the Trump administration is willing to trample on due process, human decency, the wellbeing of our communities, and even protections for vulnerable children, in pursuit of a hyper-aggressive mass deportation policy. \n\"However, President Trump does not have the last word here – the courts and the public will not allow this un-American dream to become reality.\" \nClarissa Martínez-de-Castro, deputy vice president of the Latino advocacy group National Council of La Raza, accused the administration of \"using the spectre of crime to create fear . . . in the American community about immigrants, in order to create an opening to advance the indiscriminate persecution of immigrants. \n\"This administration is saying, 'Now, everybody is going to be a priority,' and the devil may care.\" \nIn a rah-rah conclusion to the briefing for reporters, one of the Homeland Security officials declared: \"The big picture here is that we're executing what the president directed, which is consistent with what Congress put into law. \n\"We will do so professionally. We will treat everyone humanely and with dignity, but we're going to execute the laws of the United States.\" Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:46:29.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
