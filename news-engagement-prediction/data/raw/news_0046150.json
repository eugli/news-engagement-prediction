However, we had yet to see any of the cast on the set. While we're still going to have to wait to see them in costume, we've now had our first taste of them all in a very familiar place. The majority of the actors in the new film, including Alden Ehrenreich, Donald Glover, Emilia Clarke, and more have crammed themselves into the Millennium Falcon's cockpit. This movie just got crowded. \nWhile not in costume we do get our first look at what Alden Ehrenreich will look like as the younghHan Solo. His hair is certainly very different than it was the last time we saw him in Hail, Caesar. We have to say that while he's not a dead ringer for a young Harrison Ford, there is certainly enough a resemblance to make this movie work. He's joyed by Donald Glover who will play Lando Calrissian, apparently with a beard maybe, and Woody Harrelson, along with Emilia Clarke, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and, the only person in costume, Joonas Suotamo who will be taking on the role of Chewbacca. They're joined on the Falcon by directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller. \nMore to come...
