He said even though his plan to build an underground network of tunnels might seem crazy, it's actually less crazy than flying cars. \n“Obviously, I like flying things,” Musk told Bloomberg. “But it’s difficult to imagine the flying car becoming a scalable solution.” \nSeveral companies are pursuing flying cars. Google co-founder Larry Page is funding secretive startup Zee.Aero to build a flying car. Uber has also launched a flying car project . \nThese ventures don't involve building a flying car per se because they are intended to also drive on roads. Zee.Aero and Uber are actually building Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircrafts that, like the name suggests, can take off vertically without a runway. Uber has said it would use VTOLs to transport people within cities. \nMusk said flying cars need to generate a lot of downward force to not fall out of the sky, which would result in a lot of wind and noise for people on the ground. He also said there's a risk of falling debris if falling cars were to get in a mid-air fender bender. \n“If somebody doesn’t maintain their flying car, it could drop a hubcap and guillotine you,” Musk said. “Your anxiety level will not decrease as a result of things that weigh a lot buzzing around your head.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T17:14:15.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
