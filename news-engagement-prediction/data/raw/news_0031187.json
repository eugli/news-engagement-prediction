Mandatory Credit: Adam Hunger-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Adam Hunger, USA TODAY Sports) \nWhen the Orlando Magic hired Rob Hennigan in 2012 as the youngest general manager in the NBA, they drew praise for taking a risk and hiring one of the brightest young minds in basketball. \nHennigan then turned around and traded franchise superstar Dwight Howard - and somehow clearly won a four-team trade for the ages. The assets the Magic received in the Howard trade set them up for a bright future with tons of trade bait and potential \"lottery tickets\" - high-upside players and draft picks that could prove very valuable with a good break or two. I mean, let's just look at the Basketball-Reference.com transaction report , as we italicize everything going to the Magic: As part of a 4-team trade, the Orlando Magic traded Jason Richardson to the Philadelphia 76ers; the Orlando Magic traded Earl Clark, Chris Duhon and Dwight Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers; the Denver Nuggets traded Arron Afflalo , Al Harrington , a 2013 2nd round draft pick (Romero Osby was later selected) and a 2014 1st round draft pick (Dario Saric was later selected) to the Orlando Magic; the Los Angeles Lakers traded Christian Eyenga , Josh McRoberts and a 2017 1st round draft pick to the Orlando Magic; the Los Angeles Lakers traded Andrew Bynum to the Philadelphia 76ers; the Philadelphia 76ers traded Andre Iguodala to the Denver Nuggets; and the Philadelphia 76ers traded Maurice Harkless , Nikola Vucevic and a future 1st round draft pick to the Orlando Magic. Denver will send the lower of its two 2014 first round draft picks to Orlando. \nInstead, the Magic find themselves mired in their fifth consecutive losing season under Hennigan. And their trade Tuesday of their best player, Serge Ibaka, to the Raptors for Terrence Ross and a late first-rounder highlights that this franchise is not winning now. \nIt's the latest in an ugly string of trades that essential equates to straight-up talent attrition. If the Magic had simply kept all the pieces they had acquired, they'd have a deep, young team that looks like an Eastern Conference version of the rising Utah Jazz. Instead, they have a mess. \nThat's the result of losing almost every trade you're in for 4 Â½ years. The failure on the trade market has been compounded by free agency mistakes and low-upside drafting in a way that has the Magic staggering for an identity and slipping to the second-to-last spot in the Eastern Conference.But we're here to talk about trades, so let's look back at every important deal they've made since Howard, in chronological order: J.J. Redick to the Bucks \nTraded Feb. 21, 2013, with Gustavo Ayon and Ish Smith, for Tobias Harris, Doron Lamb, Beno Udrih and cash. \nHow it looked then: This one was widely praised, especially because the positives of the Howard trade already were becoming obvious. Redick was viewed as not getting any better, while Harris had a ton of talent and immediately showed it off with a huge finish to the season. \nHow it looks now: Now that they've dumped Harris for nothing (see below), this one looks less than great. Redick kept getting better and now is one of the best shooting guards in the NBA, and Smith has carved out a nice niche as a premier backup point guard. \nGrade: C+ Dario Saric to the 76ers \nTraded June 26, 2014, as the No. 12 overall pick with a heavily protected first-rounder for No. 10 pick Elfrid Payton. \nHow it looked then: Like the 76ers, who didn't want Payton, put the squeeze on the Magic, who desperately did. \nHow it looks now: Saric is having a solid rookie season with plenty of potential left. Payton looks like a really good backup point guard. Right now he's the better player, but most people would take Saric if they had to do it again - even ignoring the pick that was essentially the Sixers taking back a future pick they owed. \nGrade: C Arron Afflalo to the Nuggets \nTraded June 27, 2014, for Evan Fournier and Devyn Marble. \nHow it looked then: This move seemed to help both teams. Afflalo had developed into a very strong starting-caliber shooting guard and was returning to the Nuggets, while Fournier had a lot of potential. \nHow it looks now: Every rule has an exception. Fournier has been better than Afflalo, plain and simple, since this trade, as Afflalo has played for four teams in three years. \nGrade: A- Moe Harkless to the Trail Blazers \nTraded July 14, 2015, for a 2020 second-round pick that probably won't even come over. \nHow it looked then: Absurdly frugal. Harkless was 22 and had shown promise before an injured third season. \nHow it looks now: Still absurdly frugal. Harkless might be the Blazers' third-best player, emerging as a committed defender and regular starting small forward. The Blazers are better than the Magic. The Magic's biggest position of weakness is small forward. \nGrade: F Channing Frye to the Cavaliers \nTraded as part of a three-team deal on Feb. 18, 2016, for a 2016 second-round pick and Jared Cunningham (who was immediately waived). \nHow it looked then: Frye didn't fit with the Magic's future, but to get next-to-nothing for a valuable stretch-shooting big man was surprising. Mostly, people focused on the Blazers taking on Anderson Varejao's contract. \nHow it looks now: Frye has been revitalized with the Cavaliers and shown that he probably could have helped enough other contenders that the Magic might have gotten more for him. \nGrade: C Tobias Harris to the Pistons \nTraded Feb. 16, 2016, for Ersan Ilyasova and Brandon Jennings. \nHow it looked then: The Magic made a salary dump and sent a 23-year-old talented scorer away for nothing. \nHow it looks now: Harris boosted his shooting percentages in Detroit and has become a very effective offensive combo forward. Ilyasova became trade filler, and Jennings left in free agency after the season. The Magic used almost the same salary they would have paid Harris to pay Jeff Green, who is much, much worse in the same role. \nGrade: F Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to the Thunder \nTraded June 23, 2016, with Ersan Ilyasova, for Serge Ibaka. \nHow it looked then: Like an overpay. Oladipo had plenty of promise, and Sabonis was the No. 11 overall pick. Ibaka, meanwhile, was good enough to justify that cost except that he also was set to become a free agent after the season. \nHow it looks now: Tuesday's trade of Ibaka - as Oladipo and Sabonis both start for the playoff-bound Thunder - highlights how lopsided this deal was. \nGrade: D Serge Ibaka to the Raptors \nTraded Feb. 14, 2017, for Terrence Ross and a 2017 first-rounder. \nHow it looked then: Like the Raptors called the Magic's bluff on their confidence in re-signing Ibaka. \nHow it looks now: We'll see. \nGrade: Not applicable yet, but probably not good.
