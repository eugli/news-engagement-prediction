An extradition request in 2015 had been denied by a Viennese court, which called the U.S. allegations “politically motivated.” The final decision to send Firtash to the United States will be made by the Austrian Ministry of Justice.\nFirtash wielded significant political power in Ukraine under former President Viktor Yanukovych, who was overthrown by street protests in 2014. Firtash was arrested in Vienna on an FBI warrant just weeks after Yanukovych fled to Russia and was succeeded by a vocally pro-Western government. Firtash’s lawyers claim that he is being targeted by the United States as part of a political inquisition against Yanukovych’s former political allies.\nThe criminal investigation was initiated under the Obama administration. Firtash had previously weighed teaming up with American investors and political strategist Paul Manafort, a former campaign manager to President Trump, to buy high-end real estate in the United States, including the famous Drake Hotel in New York. No deals were ever completed, and Firtash has denied that he invested in the project.\nFirtash previously owned half of a company that negotiated natural gas sales from Russia and Central Asian countries to Ukraine, a lucrative business that Reuters in 2014 reported made him billions of dollars.\nRead more\nInside Trump adviser Manafort’s world of politics and financial dealmaking\nTrump campaign chief Paul Manafort named in Ukraine anti-corruption probe\nUkrainian oligarch with ties to Russia’s Gazprom arrested on FBI warrant\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostworld/"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:00:23.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
