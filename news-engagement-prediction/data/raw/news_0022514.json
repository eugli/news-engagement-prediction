And yet, people are getting injured while trying to get healthier.\nWhat better way to wind down from the working day than taking out your stresses on the footy field?\nAn estimated two-in-three Australians over the age of 15 take part in organised sport.\nHowever, a survey released to news.com.au claims employers are paying for our love of getting physical with millions of sickies taken due to self-inflicted sporting injuries.\nNearly 14 per cent of Aussies have admitted to taking time off due to injuries which occurred on the cricket pitch, squash court and footy field.\nTwo and half million people were forced to take some time off work due to aches and sprains sustained in the name of sporting prowess.\nAlmost 200,000 people had to give up work entirely due to wrecking their bodies in their recreation time.\nAmateur footy players, like the team at Port Districts Football Club are the most likely to get injured.

Source: News Corp Australia \nThe research was undertaken by comparison website finder.com.au which surveyed 2000 people.\nFinder.com.au money expert, Bessie Hassan, said while Australians had a reputation for being sports obsessed, physical activity didn’t come without its risks.\n“Football is the leading cause of injuries requiring a trip to emergency — with around one-third of all sports injury hospitalisations associated with playing various codes of football.”\nPhysical pain wasn’t the only ailment the injured suffered from. It was a kick in the hip pocket as well, she said.\n“Sport is a very big part of the Aussie psyche so it’s no surprise how many people are injured every year — what is surprising is how many people miss out on pay because of it.”\nOf those injured, 21 per cent took a combination of sick and annual leave while 16 per cent had to had to take unpaid leave while they were recovered leaving them out of pocket.\nMen were more likely to need time off work than woman, with 16 per cent having chucked a sporting sickie. Only 13 per cent of women had done the same.\nWatching a game of amateur netball, this lady is probably the least likely person on the lot to have an injury.

Perhaps by banning after work sport?\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics data shows 11.1 million adults take part in sport or another form of physical recreation each year but that figure has been steadily decreasing.\nParticipation generally decreased with age with teenagers the most active.\nCanberrans are the most physical with three-quarters getting some exercise.
