Paper cups also consume more resources in their manufacture than foam cups do.\nWATCH: The facts about disposable cups (2:15) \n\nThe other participating businesses are A.R.C Coffee, Sarnies, The Assembly Ground, Strangers' Reunion, Symmetry, Xiao Ya Tou, Curious Palette, Yellow Cup Coffee, Dapper Coffee, and Tiong Hoe Speciality Coffee.\nCoffee chains like Starbucks and Coffee Bean have already been offering 50 cents off drinks when customers bring their own containers.\nBut one online user - responding to a separate Facebook poll conducted last week by Channel NewsAsia and CNA Insider - felt efforts should go further.\n\n\nSaid Fadilah Amir Hamzah: “If we’re really serious about being zero waste… then this should be done nationwide, endorsed by the state and made into policy. An ‘opt in’ method by well-meaning retailers will not have the impact we desire.”\nAndrew Ong too felt the Government should urge more local enterprises to support these eco-initiatives.\n\n\nGenerally, many Facebook respondents decided that offering a discount was better than charging customers for using disposable ware. At least one, however, argued that peer pressure would work better than monetary solutions.\n“I was influenced by friends around me who brought their own lunch boxes to take away food and refusing to purchase food from stalls using disposables,” commented Ms Elaine Chong.\n“Everyone has a part to play, and it’s not just the stall-holders’ responsibility.”\n\n\nA few commentators suggested other ideas, such as getting retailers to trade in disposable ware for biodegradable takeaway cups, or renting out tumblers for a deposit.\n\n\nJust how sustainable will the BYO initiative be in convincing Singaporeans to curb their use of disposable ware?\n\nIt turns out that Trash Trail’s collaboration will not be the last of its kind. Zero Waste Singapore, a non-governmental organisation, said in a comment on ChannelNewsAsia’s Facebook page that it would launch a similar programme with more local retailers by mid-2017.\n\n\nBesides, there’s an added incentive for retailers to join the BYO movement.\n\nMs Rachel Tang, the marketing manager of Symmetry and Xiao Ya Tou, said that apart from being environmentally friendly, initiatives like this “may also be able to help the business defray a little bit of expenses spent on disposable packaging or cleaning services”.\nWatch the Trash Trail episode on disposable cups here .
