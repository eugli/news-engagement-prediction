In contrast, the solar concentrators reduce the demand for photovoltaic inverters, use diffuse light and can be placed on any surface,\" said Alexander Ridge, one of the project's developers. \nThis article appeared originally on the Global Times website. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T15:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:38:23.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
