Is senator Corey Bernardi about to defect? \nThere is speculation Liberal senator Cory Bernardi is set to leave the Coalition to create his own conservative movement. More videos Malcolm Turnbull's crucial fortnight \nHe's starting the year with poor polling numbers, so Malcolm Turnbull needs some wins as parliament resumes, says Mark Kenny. \nConsider the pattern. Adrift on a sea of electoral ennui since January's robo-debt/pension cuts and the MPs' expenses scandal, Turnbull moved to wrest control of national politics last Wednesday with his National Press Club speech. \nYet somehow, he had chosen the very day the political donations for last year's election would become public - minus, it turned out, his own $1.75 million gift.
