On show at Kensington Palace, it offers a unique insight into her life. In this final pullout, REBECCA ENGLISH reveals Diana’s daring side, including the gown she wore to dance with a Hollywood legend — and wow the world . . . A very flirty take on the tuxedo Bellville Sassoon, 1989 With its white cuffs and collar, this cocktail dress is a playful interpretation of the masculine tuxedo, which Diana, with her 34-27-34 model proportions, could carry off with aplomb. She wore it to The Marriage Of Figaro by the English National Opera Diana was always a royal rule-breaker — and her dresses were no exception. Although she initially attempted to conform to the constraints of ‘sensible’ royal dressing, the Princess eventually started to stretch her boundaries with more overtly fashionable styles. With its white cuffs and collar, this cocktail dress is a playful interpretation of the masculine tuxedo, which Diana, with her 34-27-34 model proportions, could carry off with aplomb. Worn here to a performance of The Marriage Of Figaro by the English National Opera in 1991, the starkness of the black and white silk satin is softened with glass beading and a girlish bow. Diana first wore the dress two years earlier, and the difference in her figure is striking. Gone are the bony and slightly protruding shoulders caused by her bulimia. Now, basking in the glow of a string of admirers, including James Hewitt, James Gilbey and Oliver Hoare, she appears fit, strong and full of vitality. According to the Daily Mail’s style editor, Dinah van Tulleken, the cheeky satin bow wouldn’t look out of place in this season’s Marc Jacobs collection. She says: ‘The sequined bodice and understated pencil skirt work perfectly to create a stylish, but sophisticated, dress. The bow adds a dose of modesty to the sexy, off-the-shoulder design.’ The dress was bought in 1997 by Paris Match magazine for £30,000 and given away as a competition prize. Gown that made Travolta swoon at the White House Victor Edelstein, 1985 Worn to a state dinner at the White House in November 1985, Diana, who had once dreamed of becoming a ballerina, loved the way it swirled around her knees when she took to the dance floor with actor John Travolta Known as her ‘Travolta’ dress, this midnight-blue velvet evening dress is one of the most memorable in Diana’s wardrobe. Worn to a state dinner at the White House in November 1985, Diana, who had once dreamed of becoming a ballerina, loved the way it swirled around her knees when she took to the dance floor with actor John Travolta. And for the Princess, it was also a chance to show Charles exactly what he was missing. A year earlier, she had given birth to their second son, Prince Harry, but her happiness was short-lived and, within months, her marriage collapsed. And for the Princess, it was also a chance to show Charles exactly what he was missing. A year earlier, she had given birth to their second son, Prince Harry, but her happiness was short-lived and, within months, her marriage collapsed ‘It just went bang, our marriage, the whole thing went down the drain,’ she told her biographer Andrew Morton. Inspired by an Edwardian dinner dress, its off-the-shoulder bodice, flattering midnight-blue colour and ruched detail made this gown one of Diana’s favourites, and it was always worn with her trademark pearl and sapphire choker. ‘The craftsmanship is just incredible,’ says exhibition curator Eleri Lynn. ‘The bottom of the dress swirls out from the knee in a flurry of fabric and gives the pictures so much movement. ‘This dress makes the difference between a great picture and an iconic one. And Diana knew that.’ It sold at Diana’s 1997 charity auction of her dresses for more than £150,000, and sold again three years ago for almost £250,000. Wearing a simple but striking cream silk mini, this is carefree, post-divorce Diana at her most confident. Indeed, everything about this ensemble — down to Diana’s slightly mischievous expression — speaks of sheer joie de vivre and rosy optimism Mini-dress to tear up the royal rulebook Catherine Walker, 1997 Wearing a simple but striking cream silk mini, this is carefree, post-divorce Diana at her most confident. The Princess commissioned this figure-hugging number to launch the 1997 charity auction of her most memorable dresses at a gala at Christie’s in New York. Designer Catherine Walker was asked to make a deliberately light and understated outfit to counter the stately glamour of the clothes on sale. Even Diana’s fingernails sported a barely-there French manicure. The message she was sending could not have been clearer: that was then, this is now. ‘This is Diana tearing up the royal rulebook,’ says Daily Mail style editor Dinah van Tulleken. ‘There aren’t many people who can pull off a bodycon mini dress with such elegance and grace. ‘The floral embroidery gives it a sophisticated edge and her stylish gold sling-back Jimmy Choo shoes were the perfect addition.’ Indeed, everything about this ensemble — down to Diana’s slightly mischievous expression — speaks of sheer joie de vivre and rosy optimism. It makes her sudden death just a few weeks later seem all the more tragic. What she would have gone on to achieve, and whether she would have found true happiness again, will sadly never be known. Style she stole from Madonna Catherine Walker, 1992 AS THIS daring, double-breasted, green silk velvet evening gown shows, Diana often adapted trends to suit her taste. The smoking jacket-style dress was made popular in the Nineties by the likes of Cindy Crawford and Madonna, but the Princess added her own feminine touch with velvet and diamante buttons. First worn to a private event in 1992, she posed in it for a Vanity Fair photoshoot with Mario Testino five years later to publicise her charity auction. Its halterneck style with wide lapels enhanced her shoulders, making her waist look even smaller. ‘She looked so happy and fresh and sure of herself,’ the photographer said afterwards. Relieved following her divorce and enjoying the attentions of handsome heart surgeon Hasnat Khan, Diana was, indeed, at her most vibrant. Sadly, the couple split shortly before her death.

Most famous for Diana’s Vanity Fair photoshoot in 1997, but also worn to several private events, the grey silk satin with imitation pearl embroidery is a design classic, says Daily Mail style editor Dinah van Tulleken. Its creator, Catherine Walker, later explained her desire to make a ‘dignified showstopper’ for Diana — a dress that she could enjoy wearing, free from the constraints of her royal life. ‘The thick stretches of beading around the arms and neckline reflect light on to the face and draw the eye up,’ says Dinah. ‘The flattering drapery on the side adds interest and leaves what could have been a very formal style looking more relaxed.’ A serene diplomatic triumph Catherine Walker, 1986 Simple, serene — and bearing a well-chosen tribute to her hosts — this is diplomatic Diana at her graceful best. Like her mother-in-law the Queen, the Princess carefully selected her looks on international tours in order to honour the nation she was visiting. In this case, she incorporated a falcon, the national bird of Saudi Arabia, into her dress for an official visit. Made from cream silk crepe and embroidered with gold and silver sequined birds, its high neckline and long sleeves are also in tune with local custom. Catherine Walker said the falcons were stitched on to the finished dress at the last possible moment, so they would appear to ‘fly’ over the seams. The Princess was never pictured wearing the gown in public. The Princess knew that black accentuated her statuesque figure, and thought it a chic and fashionable option — particularly for evening dress. Daring Di with her black lace, racy silk — and fake pearls Victor Edelstein, 1987 The Queen rarely wears black in public, preferring instead to sport bold colours so she can be seen more easily. This was another royal convention Diana ripped up when it came to the way she dressed. The Princess knew that black accentuated her statuesque figure, and thought it a chic and fashionable option — particularly for evening dress. Debuted at a classical music concert in 1987, this Victor Edelstein number was worn again two years later at the London Coliseum and shows off her athletic shoulders. It was a clever design by Edelstein, who laid fine, black lace over a magenta silk, creating a shimmering, rich bronze colour close-up. Indeed, the media reported the outfit very favourably, with the Daily Mail saying on the night: ‘Daring Di gives fashion the cold shoulder!’ While the Princess had a vast collection of priceless formal jewels at her disposal, she still loved to experiment with costume jewellery. Here, she paired the gown with a long string of fake pearls — another impish act of rebellion.
