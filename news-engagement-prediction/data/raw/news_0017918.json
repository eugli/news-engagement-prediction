The order bans citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria. The order is being challenged in courts. The chef said he was just practicing his freedom of speech and the response he has received has been pretty positive overall. Simmons competed on Season 4 of Bravo's cooking show, \"Top Chef.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:14:00.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
