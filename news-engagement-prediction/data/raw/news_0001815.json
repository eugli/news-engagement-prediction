During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump alarmed voters with his seemingly blasé attitude toward nuclear weapons, refusing to rule out dropping them over Europe under the right circumstances, and reportedly asking a foreign policy adviser why America did not use nukes more often. His fixation on apocalyptic rhetoric seems to have extended to parliamentary procedure, too. On Wednesday, shortly after Senate Democrats signaled that they were prepared to filibuster the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch , Trump publicly encouraged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to use the so-called “nuclear option”—eliminating the Supreme Court filibuster permanently—if necessary. In order to get Gorsuch confirmed under current Senate rules, Trump would need 60 votes for cloture, which would be impossible given the current partisan composition of the Senate. Democrats could exploit that fact to delay Gorsuch’s appointment indefinitely, the same way the G.O.P. stonewalled Obama nominee Merrick Garland , though some caucus members are reportedly worried Republicans could retaliate by holding a simple majority vote to get rid of the filibuster for judicial appointments entirely. Trump, who decried the potential gridlock in comments to reporters Wednesday, is apparently more than happy to see that outcome. “If we end up with that gridlock I would say, ‘If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,’” Trump said. “Because that would be an absolute shame if a man of this quality was put up to that neglect. I would say it’s up to Mitch, but I would say, ‘Go for it.’” While that kind of zero-sum thinking is characteristic of Trump’s approach to the business world, not all Republicans agree. In an interview with Politico published last Friday, McConnell argued that killing the judicial filibuster would be an extremely short-sighted political move, and said that he would prefer to keep it intact. “That’s not a presidential decision. That’s a Senate decision,” he said. “What I’ve said to him, and I’ve stated publicly and I’ll say today: We’re going to get this nominee confirmed.” He doubled down on his stance in a separate interview with The Hill , implying that Trump should keep his nose out of his house. “Senate rules are a matter for the Senate and a lot of other people have opinions.” Trump, however, seems less inclined to respect the slower pace of the Senate, and told reporters that he wanted to move on Gorsuch quickly. “We wanna have him go through an elegant process as opposed to a demeaning process because they’re very demeaning on the other side, and they wanna make you look as bad as possible,” said Trump, adding that, “of course, the press can be very demeaning too.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:25:08.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
