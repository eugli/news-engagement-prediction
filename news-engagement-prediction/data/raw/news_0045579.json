Andres Kudacki/AP \nPresident Donald Trump is set to issue a new executive order replacing his travel ban as early as Tuesday to circumvent a nationwide injunction that has halted the current order. \nThe new measure is expected to curtail immigration from the same seven, predominately Muslim countries listed in the original order: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \nHowever, unlike the current measure, the new restrictions are expected to explicitly exempt green-card holders, dual U.S. citizens who also hold citizenship in any of the seven named countries, and travelers who already have U.S. visas. \nThe new executive order is also not expected to specifically bar Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Trump Compared to Nixon ] \nDetails of the new order were first reported by the Associated Press , which cited an unnamed senior administration official. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, whose agency oversees immigration enforcement, said Saturday at a security conference in Munich that the new \"streamlined\" order will focus on seven countries, which he did not name. \nThe secretary previously testified before a House committee that the administration is \"not contemplating\" adding more countries to the travel ban. \nKelly and the Trump administration have disputed that the original executive order, signed Jan. 27, amounts to a travel ban or that it explicitly targets Muslims as civil rights groups, immigration advocates and Democratic lawmakers have alleged – concerns that have also been raised by some congressional Republicans . Reiterating remarks from a press conference earlier this month, Kelly said in Munich that the orders represented a \"temporary pause,\" which would allow the administration to \"see where our immigration and vetting system has gaps – and gaps it has – that could be exploited.\" \nThe original measure suspended the U.S. refugee program for 120 days, prohibited entry by Syrian refugees indefinitely, and halted entry for 90 days by citizens of the seven nations listed in the order. \nComing with little warning and containing few details, it sparked chaos and protests at international airports , as hundreds of travelers found themselves delayed or detained, and some ordered back to their native countries. Adding to the confusion, legal permanent residents – or green-card holders – and dual U.S. citizens with citizenship in any of the listed countries were also initially seen as affected by the order, but the administration later clarified that they would generally be exempt. \n[ READ: Trump Administration \"Not Contemplating\" More Countries for Immigration Ban ] \nEarlier this month, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco unanimously upheld a nationwide stay that has frozen the current executive order. The judges – appointed by presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Jimmy Carter – cited in part the \"immediate and widespread\" impact of the order, and that the government \"pointed to no evidence\" that an immigrant from any of the seven named countries had carried out a terrorist attack in the U.S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:57:16.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
