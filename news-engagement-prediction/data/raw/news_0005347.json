Staff from the Salvation Army were also on standby. \nWhile about half a dozen homeless people were outside of the station on Tuesday, by Wednesday morning more had joined the camp to protest.

She criticised the media for demonising homeless people, with News Corp publication the Herald Sun saying in an editorial that “with the filth, intimidation and hygiene risks … there is enough to meet criteria for police to move in and move these vagrants on”. \nThe council said the groupwas being moved on because builders were preparing to repaint the station as part of an upgrade and restoration project. Trucks with scaffolding on the back were parked in front of the station on Wednesday. \nBut Parker said she believed the painting work was being used as an excuse to remove homeless people from outside of the station. \n“I think this is about tourists and that these people are being moved on so that the city doesn’t look bad,” she said. \nWhile homelessness has long been an issue in Melbourne , rough sleepers have found themselves under particular focus since the Australian Open began in January, when tourists poured into the city and used Flinders Street station to get to the tournament.

There had been fears the council would move to criminalise homelessness, however the lord mayor, Robert Doyle, said there were no plans to do so. \nSimon Zlatkin, who describes himself as “on again, off again” homeless person, held up a sign outside of the station saying: “Secure society, house the homeless.” He said he had been told on Wednesday morning that police would move them on within hours. \n“If I was in government I’d be building more social housing and building more homeless shelters rather than moving people on,” he said. \nAs he spoke, a man who had been walking past the scene interjected and began yelling at those taking part in the protests. “Make some sacrifices and get yourselves a bloody job and maybe you’ll get somewhere,” he yelled, as police moved in to calm him down. \nAnother police officer was calmly explaining to a group of homeless people and their supporters that social services were on standby to assist people. For the past two weeks services had been trying to engage with those at the Flinders Street camp, the officer added. She told the group that some of the rough sleepers at Flinders Street were “new” and had joined the camp that morning from other areas. \nA City of Melbourne spokeswoman told Guardian Australia that the council had been working closely with outreach support services, including the Salvation Army and Launch Housing, for many months to ensure that the rough sleepers had every opportunity to find housing and support. \n“Since December 2016, together with the Victorian government and a range of agencies, we have advised the rough sleepers that the area needs to be cleared to allow for work to begin on the Victorian government’s redevelopment of Flinders Street station,” she said. \nBut the rough sleepers showed no sign of moving on by Wednesday afternoon, surrounded by bags containing their few possessions and slogans of resistance scrawled on the station walls in chalk behind them.
