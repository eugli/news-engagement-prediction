I lived. I died.\" -- and instructs people to \"wait the appropriate amount of time\" before trying to claim her stuff. \nThey wrote it in Jean Oddi's perspective, recapping the people important to her, adventures she had and her favourite activities, including playing cards and teaching her granddaughter \"dirty songs.\" \nHer daughter, Casey Oddi Clark, tells The Columbus Dispatch the obituary celebrates a blunt woman who lived unapologetically. \nIt also promises an \"after-party\" following the funeral but warns: \"If you are sick, don't bother to come. I might be dead, but I still don't want your germs.\" Jean Oddi, Queen of Sass, bids adieu to her subjects in feisty obituary https://t.co/8HfHk7AgUc pic.twitter.com/1r40yB04pl â€” Columbus Dispatch (@DispatchAlerts) February 22, 2017 Related Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:10:14.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
