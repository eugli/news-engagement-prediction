Jordan Kahu. \n“We’re related!” Marshall excitedly reveals to foxsports.com.au when Kahu’s name is raised. \n“I think it might be his grandmother and my grandfather are brother and sister. I don’t know what it is but I know we’re related.” \nIf Marshall has got the connection right it would make he and Kahu second cousins, further explaining why the 26-year-old Kiwis star has been so eager to share his excitement at being on the same field as his new teammate.

I just played alongside Benji Marshall 😱 — jordan kahu (@JordanKahu) February 4, 2017 \n“But it’s very humbling to see that.” \nHumbling and potentially awkward, with left centre being one position identified as a good fit for the veteran recruit. \nKahu has also put his hand up for the role vacated by the retirement of Jack Reed and has firmed as the favourite to fill it after an outstanding Auckland Nines campaign. \n“I think the thing for Jordy is he’s really come on in leaps and bounds in his leadership and becoming a bit more of a senior player,” Marshall said. \n“Obviously playing for New Zealand’s helped him but not only that, if he’s fit he’ll be our first choice goalkicker so there’s no danger of him missing out on a spot. \n“If he’s fit he’ll be playing first grade, I’ll be the one playing Q Cup and that doesn’t bother me.” \nMarshall has trained at centre, as a back up in the halves and even spent some time at hooker since arriving in Brisbane. Jordan Kahu is a distant cousin of Benji Marshall, as well as a teammate.

There’s no pressure. \n“Wayne told me that there’s no need for me to be the man there because we’ve got 10 players there already who are already on top of the game. \n“That’s helped me to relax and not feel like there’s any pressure on me to have to do anything, I can just enjoy myself, and to be honest I’m really enjoying it and I’m happy.” \nDo you live in Queensland?
