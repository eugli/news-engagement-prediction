The new McLaren MCL32 Credit: Sky Sports/McLaren Honda Sean Gibson 24 February 2017 â€¢ 10:50am \nM cLaren are preparing to launch their new car for the 2017 F1 season, but have only hinted so far at what colour their livery will be. \nWith the departure of CEO and chairman Ron Dennis at the end of 2016 and the end of the long-running 'MP4' model designation, fans are expecting more changes to the look of the MCL32. \nThe launch, scheduled for 10:50, should finally settle it one way or the other - though many would be sad to see the departure of the all-black colours of 2015 and 2016. \nThe team has made a subtle hint at the inclusion of more traditional 'McLaren orange' in the 2017 cars, though rumours abound that there will also be a lot of white on display. All the new cars unveiled so far ahead of the 2017 F1 season \nH owever the new car looks, fans will be hoping the 2017 edition of the McLaren Honda will be more competitive than its predecessors. \nThe Honda power unit has largely disappointed so far in its two-year partnership with the team, who nevertheless insist that great strides have been made. \nWith many in the sport still insisting that the McLaren chassis still has the makings of a successful car, much will hinge on whether the team can make up ground in F1's power race.
