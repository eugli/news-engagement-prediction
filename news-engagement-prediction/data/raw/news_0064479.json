They may have developed information about a person or persons of interest,” an investigator told the station. \nMore than 1,000 tips have poured in about the case, but the DNA that was recovered has been passed through national criminal databases without a hit. \n\"Not a day goes by that we don't reflect on the enormity of our loss,\" Steven Therrien, Marcotte’s uncle, told reporters in December. \n“As Massachusetts State Police and Princeton police continue to investigate Vanessa’s murder, we urge anyone with information to call the state police hotline at 508-453-7589,\" Therrien said. \nThe family has set up a website in her honor, VanessaMarcotte.org . \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
