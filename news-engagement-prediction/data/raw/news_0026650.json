We have done a lot of hard work and any foul play from other parties can spoil our game,” said Manshahia. \nAAP volunteers had carried out an intense social media campaign in the run up to the elections. The party volunteers have been issued identity cards by the district electoral officer, allowing them to inspect the strongrooms, in presence of the returning officers. \nThough AAP was criticised by the Punjab and Haryana high court for doubting reliability of EVMs, Manshahia said his party has full faith in the election commission to ensure that the EVMs are not tampered before March 11. \n“There is a lot of time between voting and the counting day, which has prompted us to request the high court to ask the election commission to ensure that the machines are kept safe. We had personally observed that a few days before voting there was some laxity in security check across the state,” said Manshahia. \nYoung party volunteers from far-flung villages of the district have stationed themselves near the strongroom in government Nehru college in Mansa. \n“We kicked off the campaign when none of the other parties were even sure of their candidates. This is the last leg of the campaign and we want to outclass the opposition even in this stage,” said a volunteer from Mansa. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:36.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
