Rachel Notley says Washington trip a success as she touts Alberta climate change plan \n“There’s a pretty strong consensus among the premiers and the prime minister that probably the best way to do that is to get in front of as many people as we can to describe how much the relationship with Canadian business actually benefits American business.” \nShe says an itinerary will be firmed up in the days to come. \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau travels to the U.S. capital on Monday to meet with President Donald Trump. Congress and Trump are publicly musing about imposing new tariffs on Canadian imports. \nForeign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said this week that she has told U.S. politicians that Canada would strongly oppose new tariffs — and would respond in kind. \nNotley noted the issue is a long way from being settled. \n“The border adjustment tax is still very much up in the air,” she said. \n“Generally speaking, we’ll see the prime minister argue that the border adjustment tax applied to any sector will not be obviously helpful to Canadian exporters, but … that it will actually cause damage to American job creators and to American industry.” \nBefore she leaves, Notley will meet with members of the oil and gas, agriculture, forestry, and manufacturing sectors to gather information and advice on the best way to make Alberta’s case. \nTrade between Alberta and the United States totalled more than $100 billion in 2015. About $80.6 billion worth of goods was sent to Americans from Alberta that year. \nIndustries that export to the U.S. include oil and gas, agriculture, forestry, manufacturing and utilities. © 2017 The Canadian Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:39:11.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
