He is charged with an offense of conspiring to commit a felony on October 20, 2016. It is alleged that he was arrested at 10:30pm armed with a screw driver. He denied the charges and was released on Sh2, 000 cash bail. He told the court that he was now a saved and changed man. PHOTO: KIPSANG JOSEPH/Standard. \nOn the night self-confessed serial killer Geoffrey Matheri was arrested, he was carrying a 10-inch screwdriver, two witnesses said yesterday. \nCorporal Jared Oduor and Sergeant Mathew Agade told Resident Magistrate Nancy Makau that they stopped Mr Matheri alias Fongo near the Place Pub on Gusii Road at around 10:30pm \"as his movements looked suspicious\". \n\"Oduor searched him and recovered a 10-inch screwdriver on his left side, which we suspected was intended to be used to commit a felony,\" said Mr Agade, adding that Matheri could not explain why he had it. \nMr Oduor told the court that Matheri didn't have a national identity card. \nMatheri, he said, had informed them that he was heading for church that night when they arrested him and booked him at Central Police Station. The screwdriver was not produced in court as the investigating officer had been transferred and had handed over the file to someone else. \nThe case was adjourned to April 6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:17:16.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
