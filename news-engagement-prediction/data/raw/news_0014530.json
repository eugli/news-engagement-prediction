AIADMK General Secretary V.K. Sasikala will replace O. Panneerselvam as Tamil Nadu Chief Minister. \nOPS has resigned from his post as TN CM after two months. The decision was taken during the AIADMK legislators meet at Poes Garden on Sunday when the MLAs elected Sasikala as their legislature party leader, paving the way for her to become the next Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. \nIncumbent Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam proposed her name at the meeting of AIADMK legislators, party leaders said. The decision to elect Sasikala to succeed him was unanimous, they said. \nThe election of Sasikala puts an end to speculation about her elevation to the top post in the government since she was elected the AIADMK General Secretary following the death of Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa. \nEarlier, Panneerselvam and other ministers met Sasikala at the Poes Garden residence of Jayalalithaa where Sasikala continues to live. \nThe meeting of the legislators was called at short notice, a day after Sasikala appointed some former ministers and others who had been earlier shunted out by Jayalalithaa to various party posts. \nJayalalithaa died in December following a prolonged illness. Sasikala had been the erstwhile AIADMK leader's confidante for a long time.
