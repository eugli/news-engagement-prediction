(Facebook) \nDozens of people have protested in a small Lithuanian village against the slaying of a dog that police say an elderly couple adopted, tortured and then killed. \nProtesters with banners and a painted portrait of the dog named Moby shouted \"Murderers!\" as they gathered outside the suspects' house, where the three-year-old mixed breed male dog was reportedly killed last week. \nThe couple, who has not been named, was charged with animal cruelty. Their lawyer was not available for comment yesterday. \nIlma Germaniene, head of the shelter where Moby was placed in December after his owner died, said yesterday's rally was \"to make sure no more dogs will be slaughtered\". \nMoby was adopted mid-last month from the shelter in Sventupe, a village 80km north of the capital of Vilnius. Protesters gathered in the Lithuanian village.
