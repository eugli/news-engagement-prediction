The Sony Xperia XZ Premium and its 5.5 4K are scheduled to land in late Spring while the smaller 5.2 Sony Xperia XZs will arrive earlier (in April) to dazzle us with its cool new camera, which Sony will be marketing as Motion Eye. Sony Xperia XZ Premium \nThats what Sony calls the camera used on both the XZ Premium and XZs. Its crowning achievement is 960fps slow motion video - that allows to slow down time 4x slower than current cameraphones. It also features an anti-distortion shutter which minimizes rolling shutter. Both features are enabled by Sonys unique memory-stacked sensor . The slow-mo video is captured at 720p, though, not 1080p. Sony Xperia XZ Premium \nBut hold on, we almost buried the lede - the Xperia XZ Premium will be powered by a Snapdragon 835 chipset (we guess thats the reason behind the delayed launch). The chipset is hooked up to 4GB of RAM and will run Android 7.0, natch. \n4K screens are back, this time around with a much-improved 5.5 panel that supports HDR imagery. Thats a world first in a smartphone (but Amazon already has plenty of content you can enjoy). Besides the wider dynamic range, the new Triluminos display is 40% brightness than the Xperia Z5 Premium panel. \nThe Sony Xperia XZ Premium a Glass Loop Surface (Gorilla Glass 5, specifically) that wraps around the whole phone. The phone is waterproof (IP68) but prone to sinking - at 195g, its quite hefty for a 5.5 phone. \nAnyway, inside the body is a 3,230mAh battery with QuickCharge 3.0 to fill it up and Qnovo tech to prolong its life. Charging happens over a USB-C port, by the way. The Power button will double as a fingerprint reader though it will be disabled in some regions. \nWhen asked about price, Sony offered only the evasive answer Dependant on region and operators. The color options are creatively named Luminous Chrome and Deepsea Black. Sony Xperia XZs \nWell keep the intro for this one short because we have so much more to say about Sonys new camera. Basically, the Xperia XZs is an XZ with Motion Eye camera, which means a 5.2 1080p screen and Snapdragon 820 chipset (but RAM was bumped up to 4GB). There. \nThe camera whose name references the webcams of Vaio laptops is built around a 19MP sensor (1/2.3) sitting behind a 25mm (equiv.) f/2.0 lens. Its backed by Predictive and Laser autofocus, plus an RGBC-IR sensor for natural color rendering. \nIt can record 4K video, of course, and features SteadyShot 5-axis digital stabilization. Also, we heare that Sony has improved the Panorama mode, increasing the resolution and improving the UI. Theres more, but well leave it for the hands-on - the Motion Eye camera deserves more attention! \nWere not done talking about cameras, its just that were moving to the front. The selfie cam on both the Xperia XZs and the XZ Ultra is borrowed from the XZ - thats the fairly impressive 13MP (1/3.06) sensor with a 22mm wide-angle lens. \nNow were done. Since it doesnt have to wait for the S835 to become available, the Sony Xperia XZs will launch earlier - in April. Colors are Warm Silver, Ice Blue and... Black. \nOof, it was a struggle to keep this article at a decent length - those eager to learn more can jump over to the hands-on post. Would you believe we're still not done talking about the camera?
