These Kingdoms are Archaebacteria, Eubacteria, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia . \nOrganisms are placed into these categories based on similarities or common characteristics. Some of the characteristics that are used to determine placement are cell type, nutrient acquisition, and reproduction. The two main cell types are prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells . Common types of nutrient acquisition include photosynthesis , absorption, and ingestion. Types of reproduction include asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction . \nBelow is a list of the six Kingdoms of life and information on a few organisms in each category. Six Kingdoms of Life \n1. Archaebacteria These single-celled prokaryotes were originally thought to be bacteria. They are in the Archaea Domain and have a unique ribosomal RNA type. The cell wall composition of these extreme organisms allows them to live in some very inhospitable places, such as hot springs and hydrothermal vents. \ncontinue reading below our video Test Your General Science Knowledge Domain: Archaea Organisms: Methanogens, Halophiles, Thermophiles, Psychrophiles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T19:05:29.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
