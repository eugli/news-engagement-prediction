Fight back!” Oh mysterious benefactor, how I love thee... @Booksmith pic.twitter.com/TXi8alkYgO \n— Christin Evans (@christinevans) February 3, 2017 \nA Booksmith employee said Wednesday that Orwell's famous 1949 novel has been going fast, but that there are still a few copies left. \nThe book has been hard to secure in the Trump era. Just days after his inauguration — and Kellyanne Conway's \"alternative facts\" saga — online copies were decimated as the book quickly sold out. We're out of free copies of 1984, but we have The Handmaid's Tale and In the Garden of Beasts up for grabs. #resist #thanksmysterybenefactor pic.twitter.com/a9AVkeZSzx \n— The Booksmith (@Booksmith) February 4, 2017 \nThe store employee said the Atwood novel (which is set in a future U.S. turned into a theocratic dictatorship and has been adapted into a Hulu series coming out in April) has been almost as popular as 1984. \nOn Wednesday afternoon the store said there were still some free copies of the dystopian novel, as well as a few of Larson's nonfiction recounting of an American family living in Hilter's Berlin. Handmaid's Tale and In the Garden of Beasts are back in stock, and we've got more giveaway copies. ✨ pic.twitter.com/xFSl9HGhYg \n— The Booksmith (@Booksmith) February 8, 2017 \nThere's no word on who the mysterious book giver is, but they seem to be part of the #resistance .
