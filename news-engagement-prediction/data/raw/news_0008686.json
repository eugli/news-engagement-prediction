Courtesy ABC News 24. \nThere were only a handful of witnesses to the conversation which took place early on Saturday afternoon, Washington time. \nMr Trump's controversial chief strategist Stephen Bannon, national security adviser Michael Flynn and White House press secretary Sean Spicer were in the Oval Office when the call was made. Mr Turnbull was the fifth world leader Mr Trump had spoken to that day. It was just after 5pm and the newly minted president had earlier finished calls with the leaders of Japan, Germany, Russia and France.

They say somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes is more usual.
