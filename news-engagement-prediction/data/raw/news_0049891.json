She was absolutely horrified when she saw her brother (Photo: ITV) \nShe could then be seen mouthing 'oh my god'. Yeah, Natasha, we don't blame you - and sympathetic viewers were cringing over the awkward moment. \nOnce Arg had stopped parading around the room for the girls to get a good look at him, it was time for Paddy to ask the girls if they were \"turned on or turned off\". \nThere was only one red light after first impressions - and, of course, it came from his sister. She wasn't going to risk leaving her light on (Photo: ITV) \nHis response? \"I'm not going to Fernando's with my sister.\" We should hope not! \nArg eventually ended up bagging a date with redhead Shauni and had a great time splashing about at a water park. James Argent gets a date on Take Me Out (Photo: ITV) \nHopefully Natasha will get a trip to Fernandos soon enough - and then the two can compare around the dinner table.
