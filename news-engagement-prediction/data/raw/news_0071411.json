Additionally, the listing discloses that the device will come with IP68 dust and water resistance, Samsung Knox, 64GB of internal storage expandable via a microSD card, 4GB of RAM, Samsung Pay, Wireless Charging and 4G LTE support. \nThe device will also feature an Iris scanner, which was first introduced in the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 and is also expected to be present in S8+'s younger brother, the Galaxy S8. \nOn the imaging front, the Galaxy S8+ will come with a 12MP 'Dual Pixel' camera at the rear alongside an 8MP front facing camera. The device will also come bundled with earphones tuned by AKG. \nPrevious rumours indicate that the Galaxy S8 series will be powered by a 3.2GHz octa-core Snapdragon 835 chip in the US and a 3GHz Exynos 8895 processor in other regions. We can also expect a new voice assistant codenamed 'Bixby'. \nThe S8+ specs leak comes hot on the heels of photos emerging online of a fully functioning Galaxy S8. These images clearly showcase the radical near bezel-less design, 'Edge' sidebar and on screen capacitive keys mimicking the all too familiar layout of the physical buttons in past Samsung smartphones. \nThe Galaxy S8+ is also expected to sport a similar design, albeit with a much larger display. \nSamsung is set to reveal the official launch date of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ and S8 during MWC 2017 in Barcelona next week. Earlier rumours indicate a March reveal with sales starting from April onward.
