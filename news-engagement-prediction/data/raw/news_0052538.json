Apple last year changed the way it takes its 30% cut from App Store sales for subscription apps, cutting it to 15% after the first year. \nSensor Tower \nAlthough iPhone users are spending more on iOS apps, they are tending to download fewer apps, according to Sensor Tower's analysis, which found that the average number of apps downloaded declined to 33 last year from 35 in 2015. \nLast year, Citigroup analysts estimated that the average iOS device generated $52 in annual total sales, which is significantly higher than Sensor Tower's estimate. Citigroup also estimated that the average Android phone only generated $5.70 in annual sales from Google's Google Play app store. \nApple has recently emphasized its \"services\" business — which is mostly the rent it takes from operating the App Store on its devices, but also iCloud and Apple Music — to investors as a way Apple is keeping its overall margins and sales high as iPhone growth slows.
