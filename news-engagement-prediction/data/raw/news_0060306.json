Above, Clinton is pictured giving her concession speech weeks later\nPodesta pointed to the bureau's aggressive investigation into Clinton's emails and the decision by Director James Comey to reopen the probe days before the polls opened\nThe announcement by director James Comey to reopen the probe just 10 days before the polls open was even more intrepid, he said.\n'(He) ended up dropping this bombshell in the middle of the election against the advice of the Justice Department, against the long term practice of Democratic and Republican administrations...it's inexplicable.'\nComey said there ought to be a 'deep investigation' into Trump's ties with Russia\nPodesta also called for a 'deeper investigation' into Trump's ties with Russia, alleging the president's camp knew about the country's attempts to thwart Clinton's campaign in advance.\n'I think that needs to happen is a much more serious investigation of whatever collusion existed between the Trump campaign, the Russians and Assange.\n'I think there needs to be a deeper investigation of what did they know, when did they know it, who were they talking to, and it's fairly clear that at least they had foreknowledge of some of the activities that were being run against our campaign.'\nPodesta first shared his suspicion that the FBI acted deliberately against Clinton during the election campaign in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in December.\nThe article was titled 'Something is deeply broken at the FBI' and mapped out his concerns with the bureau's seemingly one-sided approach to the incidents which plagued the campaign.\nAt the forum earlier this month, he said another possible explanation for why it came down so heavily on his candidate was that Comey was trying to keep on the right side of influencers within it.\n'(It has) become a 'cover your a**' ass organization and there was pressure coming up from underneath him.'", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD2pwatfQg4", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-22T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:02:40.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
