But tonight, there will be a reason to pay attention to Ol' Pockmarked McMonthy: a lunar eclipse!\nTonight's event will be viewable to the vast majority of the globe (sorry, Australia and far western Asia). Most of North America will have an opportunity to catch at least some of the show, but the best seats are reserved those on the East Coast (weather permitting).\nIn New York City, for example, the eclipse will begin at around 5:30 p.m. ET and continue through the darkening night (sunset is scheduled for 5:25 p.m. ET in Gotham). Meanwhile, in the Midwest and West Coast a late moonrise will hamper early viewing (in Chicago, for example, the eclipse begins at 4:34 p.m. CT, but moonrise isn't until 5:15 p.m. PT; in Los Angeles it starts at 2:34 p.m. PT, but moonrise isn't until 5:34 p.m. PT).\n\nImage: Wikipedia / PIRULITON (own work) \nThe good news for those of you out west is that lunar eclipses are hours-long events so you should be able to catch something . Peak eclipse is scheduled to take place around two hours in (7:43 p.m. in NYC; 6:43 p.m. in Chicago; the West Coast will only see the waning portion), and the whole show won't finish up until two hours after that. You can head over to TimeAndDate for a handy personalized timeline based on your location.\nWhat to Expect (When You're Expecting an Eclipse) Tonight's eclipse will be a near-total penumbral eclipse. The Earth's shadow consists of two distinct regions: the ultra-dark umbra in the center and the hazier penumbra on either side. Tonight, the moon will pass through (but not completely fall into) our planet's penumbra. From the viewpoint of those of us on Earth, a darkened region will appear to crawl across the surface of the full moon, before slowly receding once again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:53:12.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
