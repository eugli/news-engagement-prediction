When you play at home, in our position, that is not normal. Everybody in the Premier League is strong physically and 90 per cent is not enough.” \nWenger served the second game of his four-match touchline ban , for pushing a fourth official, and ­refused to use this as a reason for the defeat. “It’s difficult to know. It’s an easy excuse,” he said. “We prepared well. We were warned Watford would make it very physical. I have no basic regret in the way we prepared. Did we think subconsciously we could turn up and it would be OK, I don’t know?” \nArsenal are now nine points ­behind Chelsea who they face at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. “We want to respond and win of course. We need to analyse why we didn’t start well,” Wenger said while brushing aside suggestions that ­defeat would end their title challenge. With Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur all drawing it was, however, a missed chance to cement their place in the top-four. \n“I’m responsible for the results so I’m frustrated,” Wenger said. “What other teams do doesn’t matter. I’m frustrated we didn’t win. We’re at home, it’s a great opportunity and we start as we did. We have to learn and respond quickly in a convincing way.” Arsenal suffered a damaging defeat \nA rsenal lost Aaron Ramsey to a calf strain, with Wenger saying he was unsure how long the midfielder will be out while he was more optimistic over Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who suffered a kick on the knee. For Watford manager Walter Mazzarri this was a significant three points in his battle to keep the club in the top-flight. “I was very happy because lately we did not deserve the long list of negative results we have had in the recent past,” the Italian said. \n“Bournemouth, Middlesbrough, Sunderland; we deserved to win and we needed a big win, a great win and especially for the morale of the team. My objective is to stay in the Premier League and make my team grow. Of course, the players need this victory to work better with myself and together we can achieve great things.” Follow Telegraph Football", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:05:20.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
