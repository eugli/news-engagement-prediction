(Photo: Eddie Garvey) \nBut it's not just football that'll be on the big screens; golf, darts, formula one, cricket, and tennis will also be shown. The bar will be screening American Football, starting with the Super Bowl on Sunday, February 5. \nVisitors will be able to take a seat at the long wooden tables, or watch the game from cosy booths which feature a convenient bell for drinks service.

Five different types of prosecco are on hand to toast to the winning team, while a large gin selection includes small batch distillers such as The Original Manchester Gin.

(Photo: Eddie Garvey) \nAnother plan is to introduce an optional membership card. While membership will not be necessary to enter the bar all the time, members will get priority during big games, which staff say will enable them to control the numbers during busy periods. \nThe Director's Box will be open for a soft launch from today, and will throw an official launch party next month, once they're settled into their new space.
