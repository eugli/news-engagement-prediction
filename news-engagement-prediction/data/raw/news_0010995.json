LyinRogerMustGo says: Feb 6, 2017 7:25 AM \nNew NFL record for points scored by one player. 20. \nAwesome stuff. LyinRogerMustGo says: Feb 6, 2017 7:28 AM \nMVP? Nah not when the GOAT set a bunch of records himself and powered the comeback. But not a crazy thought. \nðŸ™‚ sportsfan178 says: Feb 6, 2017 7:29 AM \nAll of White;s great plays were made possible because of all great plays made before his. Bennet, Edelman & Amondola This is what make the Patriots stand alone, it is a ultimate team effort Captained by the best QB of all time! 4x MVP Tom Brady! Feb 6, 2017 7:31 AM \njonwill57 says: Feb 6, 2017 7:10 AM He should have been MVP, period. \nWhite would not have been a bad MVP choice, but tough to argue with a QB who is the Greatest NFL Leader of All-Time, as well as the Greatest NFL Player of All-Time, being selected the MVP. \nI am wondering why Trey Flowers is not getting more media love after his big game on the big stage. Chandler Jones and Jamie Collins, we liked you, we really do wish you well, but we did not miss you. terripet says: Feb 6, 2017 7:37 AM \nAtlanta handed them the game horrible play calling in the second half third n one run the ball they could not stop it all night tcostant says: Feb 6, 2017 7:50 AM \nAnd in other news, the Pats RB situation is totally screwed up for fantasy, next yearâ€¦ tonebones says: Feb 6, 2017 7:54 AM \nTom Brady threw 62 passes. Thatâ€™s not a typo. Brady threw 62 passes. Thatâ€™s why Bill Belichick is smarter than everyone else. Heâ€™s smart enough to know that sometimes is smarter not to try to out-smart everybody, just let Brady throw the ball 62 times. Feb 6, 2017 7:57 AM \nI was surprised it was so much James White and so little Lewis and Blount. The Falcons did a much better job of stopping the run than I expected but they could not cover White. He had the game all by himself that I expected from him and Lewis combined. Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
