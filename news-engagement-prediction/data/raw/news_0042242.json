If you think there's nothing more beautiful than an Art Deco bathroom covered in Art Deco tile , or if you secretly love the all-pink 50s numbers that everyone else hates â€” well, this look's for you. (Image credit: House Beautiful ) \nThe project that first turned me on to the look was this one from House Beautiful . These two brand-new bathrooms, one proudly pink and the other green, look like they could have leapt right out of the 1930s (also lead image above). (Image credit: House Beautiful ) \nIt's one of the peculiarities of design that sometimes old styles, when they come back around, can feel quite new. Coming off of years and years of most neutral bathrooms, there's something so fresh about these unabashedly colorful spaces. In the pink bathroom, running the tile only halfway up the wall keeps the look from being overwhelming. Likewise, the green tile in the second bathroom is paired with white for a clean yet colorful look. (Image credit: Elizabeth Roberts ) \nRather than go whole hog with colored tile, Elizabeth Roberts, in her design for a Brooklyn Brownstone , paired green and black wall tiles with a vintage-style hex tile floor. Worth nothing are the tile wall accessories, which provide spots for soap and a cup, and the tiny black and white border that runs along the wall and around the tub. (Image credit: KML Design ) \nFor a distinctly vintage feel with less of a strictly vintage look, this bathroom from KML Design pairs green subway tile with a black and white border and pink walls. The resulting bathroom is colorful, with a certain timeless charm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:30:24.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
