Dakota Johnson feels like she exploited herself. Source: Getty \n\"There I was and it was making me feel like I was being exploited - only by myself. I was literally exploiting myself,\" she told Glamour . \n\"And I felt so raw and vulnerable and it was all my own fault. \n\"Which is why I don't get that need to offer up information about myself to strangers. I couldn't care less what models are doing on Instagram. \n\"I make movies because that's my passion and people can interpret them as they please but anything else for me is way too much.\" \nDakota deleted nearly everything from her Instagram account last September, leaving just one image remaining – a magazine cover from 2014. This is now the only photo on Dakota's Instagram. Source: Instagram \nShe had often posted raunchy and suggestive photos before that. Dakota captioned this pic 'I’ll have an order of Identity Crisis with a side of What’s My Hand Doing, #please.' Source: Instagram \nDespite her fame, the 27-year-old beauty - who is the daughter of actors Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith - insisted she rarely gets recognised in public. \n\"I'm one of those people who walks around like an invisible person,\" she said. \n\"People literally run into me and it's always been that way.\" \nDakota is currently single but \"can't tell\" if guys are intimidated by her because of her role in the kinky movie franchise, though she insists she is anything but scary. \n\"I still can't tell [if I intimidate people]... I don't think I'm a very intimidating person so I think anyone who took the time to talk to me would very quickly realise what I am,\" she said. \n\"Just a goof.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:37:41.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
