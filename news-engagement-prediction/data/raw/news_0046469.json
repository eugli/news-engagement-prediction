Guillermo Eleazar. \nLasin was brought to Quirino Memorial Medical Center for treatment. “Thank God, she suffered only a minor injury,” Eleazar said. \nIn an interview on Saturday, Eslao said he immediately surrendered to his superior upon learning what happened to Lasin. \n“I have been in the service for five years and this is the first time it happened. I was following safety precautions. I thought I had already ejected the chamber load when I accidentally pulled the trigger,” he said. \nDespite his explanation and apology, however, Eslao is facing an administrative case and a criminal complaint for reckless imprudence resulting in slight physical injury, said SPO1 Marvin Masangkay, the officer on the case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:40:27.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
