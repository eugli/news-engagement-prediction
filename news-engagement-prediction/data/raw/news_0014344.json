Come on United.” \nMartial joined United from Monaco in September 2015 in a deal potentially worth of up to £58m. Dont listen the papers it's wrong thanks Come on United 🔴 — Anthony Martial (@AnthonyMartial) February 6, 2017 \nHe was United’s top scorer last season with 17 goals in all competitions, but has struggled to cement his place in the first team under Mourinho this season and has not featured in the last three Premier League games. \nMourinho hit out at Martial and his entourage in December after the player’s agent, Philippe Lamboley, said the former Lyon youngster was a target for Sevilla. \n“Anthony has to listen to me and not his agent,” Mourinho said. “With Martial, every day I read the newspaper. ‘Martial goes to Sevilla’, ‘Martial goes on loan’, ‘Martial is not happy’. Martial has to listen to me. He is a player with amazing conditions to be a top player.” \nIn December, Martial was quoted as telling French broadcaster SFR Sport: “It’s annoying to be on the bench, it’s truly annoying, but it’s a test you have to overcome and that’s how you progress. \n“It’s difficult because all you want is to be able to help the team and when you’re on the bench you can’t.” Mata's clinical challenge", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:06:03.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
