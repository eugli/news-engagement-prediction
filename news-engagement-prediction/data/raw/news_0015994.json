The two are pictured in September with fists raised high to 'start the conversation' in regards to social injustice\nHe added he wasn't worried about what team owner Robert Kraft might think, as the CEO of the Kraft group is a Trump supporter.\nBennett confirmed after the game to the paper that he would not be going.\nMcCourty's reasoning for not going is that he said he doesn't 'feel accepted in the White House.'\n'I'm not going to the White House,' McCourty, 29, told Time magazine.\n'Basic reason for me is I don't feel accepted in the White House.\nBennett (left) said he wouldn't attend because he doesn't support President Donald Trump (right). Running back James White and linebacker Rob Ninkovich have also said they are unsure if they'll go to the White House to see Trump\n'The president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won't.'\nBoth McCourty and Bennett made headlines in September when they raised their firsts high at the end of the national anthem in order to 'start the conversation' about social injustice.\nRunning back James White and linebacker Rob Ninkovich have also said they are unsure if they'll go to the White House.\nThe Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday in Super Bowl LI 34-28.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-09T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T05:00:45.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
