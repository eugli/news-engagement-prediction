The electronic wallet allows users to use their smartphones to pay for goods in stores. That said, the best part of Samsung Pay lies in its use of NFC technology that allows it to be used in stores that normally donâ€™t support electronic payments. \nAccording to Samsung, devices that support Samsung Pay have a proprietary MST technology that allows them to mimic the magnetic strip of a credit card. This allows them to be used without any additional equipment from stores; and should make the service much more convenient both both customers and businesses. \nAt the moment, Samsung Pay supports CIMB Mastercard; Citibank Mastercard and Visa; Maybank Visa; and Standard Chartered Mastercard and Visa credit cards . Maybank Visa backed debit cards and prepaid cards are also supported . Samsung also says that support for Hong Leong Bank will be added soon, although there is no time frame given. \nLoyalty card such as B Infinite, Bonuslink, and Sunway Pals are also supported through the app.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T10:02:06.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
