But does it?\nAccording to the report, the overall uninsured rate was 8.8% in the first nine months of 2016 . That's down from 9.1% the year before, and 16% in 2010, the year President Obama signed ObamaCare — also know as the Affordable Care Act — into law. What's more, the biggest one-year drop occurred in 2014, which is the year that ObamaCare's exchanges opened and the Medicaid expansion went into effect.\nThe CDC says this means that 20 million people gained coverage since 2010.\nAndy Slavitt, who was acting administrator under Obama for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told CNBC that \"the continued reduction in the uninsured rate is more historic good news from the ACA — measured in the quality of people's lives.\"\nBut the CDC report is far less encouraging about ObamaCare than it seems.\nFor one thing, the 8.8% uninsured rate includes everyone, including those on Medicare. With the massive baby boom generation starting to retire, the number of uninsured will go down automatically as they go on that program. Those gains in coverage have nothing to do with ObamaCare.\nWhat about those under age 65? According to the CDC, the uninsured rate for this group was 10.3% in the first nine months of last year, which is virtually unchanged from the year before, but still down from 18% in 2010.\nThat seems impressive enough. But take a closer look at the data. What you find is that the entire decline in the uninsured rate is due to more people going on Medicaid or other government health programs. None of it was due to gains in coverage in the private sector.\nTo see this you have to look further back in time. While there have been gains in private-sector coverage since 2010, that also happens to be the year when unemployment peaked. So at least some of the increase simply reflects the fact that more people got jobs that provided health benefits. Those gains, too, have nothing to do with ObamaCare.\nTo better see the impact of ObamaCare, you need to compare pre-recession numbers with today's.\nIn 2005, more than two thirds (68.5%) had private coverage and 16.8% were on a government health plan, CDC data show, leaving 16% uninsured.\nToday, while the uninsured rate is down to 10.3%, the share with private coverage dropped , down to 64.8% (see chart).\nAfter accounting for population growth over those 11 years, that means the actual number of people with private coverage is basically unchanged. It was around 175 million in 2005, and is around 175 million now.\nWhat has changed is the dramatic growth in government insurance. That went from 16.8% of the under-65 population in 2005 to 26.6% now.\nThat translates into 29 million more people getting health benefits from a government program — mainly Medicaid — over the past 11 years. Just since 2010, the number has climbed by nearly 14 million.\nWhether that's a good thing or not depends entirely on whether one thinks that having millions more dependent on the government for health care is a good thing — particularly when most of them ended up on Medicaid, a program that is suffering huge financial problems and chronic shortages of doctors willing to see those patients.\nWhat the data clearly indicate, however, is that the job of repealing ObamaCare is actually much easier than it seems.\nIf the GOP keeps the Medicaid expansion in place for the time being — it will preserve all the gains in the number of insured under ObamaCare. Meanwhile, repealing ObamaCare's ruinous mandates and regulations, and replacing them with market-based reforms that make insurance more competitive and less expensive — like expanded Health Savings Accounts — could result in more people being covered in the private sector than under ObamaCare.\nOnce those private-sector fixes are in place, the GOP can then figure out what to do with the Medicaid program, and find ways to transition people off government insurance.\nMerline is Deputy Editor of Commentary at IBD.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T11:54:07.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
