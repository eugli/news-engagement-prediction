Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe idea of building museum to celebrate Manchester music isn't new one, but yesterday's announcement of a public debate to flesh out the plans did bring the topic to the fore. \nThe discussion, which takes place in the old Cornerhouse on Wednesday March 1, will see some of the best music minds in Manchester come together to talk through to pros and cons of establishing a Manchester Music Legacies Centre. \nTogether they will start the mammoth task of who will be remembered and how. From the The Stone Roses and The Smiths right through to Whyte Horses , Cabbage and BRIT Awards winners The 1975 . \nBut it's not just the panel who will have their say - the public are a key member of the process. And it's clear from the responses to our article that there's plenty to discuss. \nHere are just some of the points raised on social media and the original article , which give more insight into the Manchester music museum debate. Stockport band Blossoms Should Manchester have a music museum? \"Yes, mad for it\" \"It would bring much needed tourism\" \nMusicLover1985 writes on the comments section : \"Manchester has been needing a music museum for far too long now. It isn't just bands like: The Smiths, Stone Roses, Oasis and Blossoms but also for bands that have been around such as Take That and The Bee Gees. If there were a music museum, it would bring much needed tourism and money coming in from far afield of Manchester. \n\"We have proved with the Football museum that having a museum dedicated to one type of entertainment, that it can be a success. Please, let Manchester have a music museum, it is badly needed\" \"Easy money\" \nNeilUtd comments on the article : \"100% yes. No moaning or griping but its actually a missing piece of the commercial jigsaw this for the City Council. The National Football Museum is here so why not a Manchester Music Museum or Northern Music. Easy money \" Manchester band The 1975 won Best British Group at the BRIT Awards (Photo: Ian West/PA Wire) \"Museums are for looking at old bones\" \nPaul Walmsley writes on Facebook : \"Rock music shouldn't have museums full stop. Museums are for things from the past that are no more, history. Rock n roll is about the here and now. Museums are for looking at old bones.\" \"More music venues\" \"Invest in space for artists\" Read More Peter Hook of Joy Division (Photo: Mark McNulty) \"Joy Division oven gloves\" \nJoe Cribbin writes on Facebook: \"No not a museum, more venues and opportunities to play and hear live music. Decent affordable rehearsal spaces, free music lessons for young and old, professional management facilities for artists. \n\"Do anything to keep it alive and bring the next generation through rather than stare at a pair of Joy Division oven gloves.\" \"A museum will hang over future artists like a vulture\" Mark Drinkwater writes on Facebook: \"Yes if its for all UK music. No if its Manchester only. I rate Manchester's music in the highest regard, but a museum will hang over future artists like a vulture much in same way the cavern club does in Liverpool.\" Take That at their book signing for 'Our Story' in 1993 (Photo: Mirrorpix) Read More \"bucket hats and Adidas Originals\" \"They could inspire the legacies of the next Manchester musicians\" \nDave Haslam who is chairing the debate says “initially I was sceptical because a lot of people are concerned that such a music centre could be regressive and would totally focus on the past, even if just for the music tourism economy.\" \n\"However, it seems there might be good ideas for a centre that go far beyond being a nostalgic museum and they could inspire the legacies of the next Manchester musicians and could have a huge educational value . How such a centre might work best in practice, or even if it necessary seems worth debating”. \nIf you want to get involved and have your say, tickets for the debate cost £3.78 including booking fee and are available via Eventbrite . \nThe Manchester Music Legacies debate is donating all ticket proceeds to The Horsfall , whose work to improve mental health and well-being for young people through engagement the creative arts.
