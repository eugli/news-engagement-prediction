The negotiations, which have been ongoing for more than three years, are being mediated by the National Mediation Board — a federal agency. The mechanics, represented by the Teamsters Local 2727, asked the board to release them from negotiations earlier this week. Unionized mechanics negotiating a labor deal with United Parcel Service Inc. are ready to… more Bloomberg The two sides have reached an impasse on health insurance — something we've been writing about for months now. In a news release, the Teamsters accuse UPS of trying to implement massive reductions in health benefits for these 1,200 maintenance workers. The union also said the company wants reductions in benefits for retirees. In a statement, UPS said the union’s request to walk away is inappropriate: \"Negotiations have been ongoing and the parties have future dates scheduled for talks. This union request for a release is simply another tactic to try to pressure negotiations. UPS looks forward to continuing discussions and to achieving an agreement that meets the needs of the business and its employees.\" The Teamsters acknowledged that the request was a dramatic step but said it was necessary. “We are taking this extraordinary step because UPS is refusing to work with us,\" Tim Boyle , president of Teamsters Local 2727, said in the release. \"We’ll do whatever it takes to protect good, middle class jobs, our health and our families.” U.S. labor laws contain many protections that aim to prevent a strike from happening at a major airline, as UPS has pointed out many times during our coverage of this. But the Teamsters argue that a strike could still happen. The National Mediation Board could offer the mechanics and UPS the opportunity to let a neutral third-party arbitrator decide remaining contract issues as a result of this week's request. That would be different from mediation because the arbitrator would have the authority to decide, rather than mediate. If either the union or the company refuses to arbitrate the dispute, a 30-day \"cooling off\" period would be triggered and the mechanics then could be free to strike any time after the period ends, according to the Teamsters' news release. The mechanics already have voted to authorize a strike should the need arise. UPS's airline division is based in Louisville, and it operates its largest air-sorting hub, Worldport, as well as ground and Supply Chain Solutions in town. It's the metro area's largest employer , with about 22,000 full-time equivalent workers. David A.
