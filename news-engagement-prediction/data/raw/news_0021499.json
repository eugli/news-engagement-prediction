The Capital & Coast District Health Board (CCDHB) confirmed the spending before a parliamentary health select committee on Wednesday. \nPeacock, who is a compulsory patient under the Mental Health Act, is an intellectually disabled, autistic and mentally ill man who has spent the past five years in at a Porirua facility, spending up to 23 hours a day in his isolation wing. \nAgencies, including the Human Rights Commission, have raised concerns about his treatment, with the United Nations funding its review of the use of seclusion in New Zealand. READ MORE: ANDY JACKSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nGreen Party MP Gareth Hughes has raised concerns over the treatment of Ashley Peacock. \nCCDHB chief executive Debbie Chin confirmed the board shouldered most of the cost of Peacock's care, with Tairawhiti DHB contributing $183,000. \nGreen MP Gareth Hughes asked clinician Dr Susanna Every-Palmer about Peacock spending the past five years in isolation. \n\"There has been a bit of a narrative about this and it's simply not true,\" she replied. MURRAY WILSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nLabour's health spokeswoman Annette King has reservations about the condition of a mental health facility in Porirua. \n\"He is not in isolation. He is not in seclusion and I think we have to be aware of that because a lot of the commentary has focused on that.\" \nEvery-Palmer, who is not Peacock's doctor, but has worked with his family and carers, said he was a \"high-risk\" patient with complex needs. \nA pathway to community care was a \"goal\" - but that transition would have to factor in his own, and the public's safety, Every-Palmer said. \nThe committee also heard the board's plans to invest in a partial rebuild and refurbishment of its regional forensic mental health facility at Porirua, which treats high-risk mentally ill offenders. Ad Feedback \nLabour's health spokeswoman Annette King asked whether the work was ordered because it did not meet fire regulations and was not fit for purpose. \nThe DHB's mental health services director Dr Nigel Fairley said it did meet the regulations, but was one of the first facilities built after the 1988 Mason Report sparked the creation of the forensic service - and it needed updating. \n\"The facility doesn't really fit that modern approach, but once it's upgraded it will. We're fairly pleased about that.\" \nCapital & Coast and the Ministry of Health had also jointly invested $15.3 million in building the country's first forensic unit for youth offenders with mental illness or addiction issues. \nThe DHB ended the 2015/16 financial year with a $11.9 million deficit, comprising 2 per cent of its total budget. A 2016/17 deficit of $17.9m was forecast. \nThe board was dealing with increasing demand, and pressure on staff costs - but savings had been made via its laundry and laboratory contracts, chairman Andrew Blair said. \nChin confirmed there had been cases in the past year of surgery being rescheduled due to high demand - however the DHB had increased its funding into primary care. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:39:35.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
