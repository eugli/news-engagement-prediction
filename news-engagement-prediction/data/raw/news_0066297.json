Otherwise, these and other steps will probably not be so easy to implement,” Lavrov added. \nUS President Donald Trump, who announced in late January that he “ would absolutely do safe zones in Syria,” re iterated his plan on Sunday, saying it would be good to create places for civilians in war-torn countries “so they can stay there and live safely” instead of bringing them to the US. \nREAD MORE: Trump call for 'safe zones' in Syria worrying start for new White House \nAs for funding the project, Trump said “we’re going to have the Gulf States pay for those safe zones. They’ve got nothing, but money.” \nLavrov said that he first met America’s new secretary of state in Bonn on February 16, when the two diplomats discussed bilateral relations as well as the situation in Syria, Afghanistan, and Ukraine. Afterwards, both parties described the talks as “productive,” stressing that they were eager to find ways to mend Russia-US relations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:16:39.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
