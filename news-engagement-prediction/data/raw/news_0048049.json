I already knew that before I continued with my journey,” he said. “I’ve been praising God all of my life, now I’m just dedicated to letting this world be a better place…I just want to remind people that whenever it gets overbearing, there is always somebody that you can lean on. I’m a strong believer in God almighty.” \nVegas is the second Jamaican artist to announce their departure from dancehall’s hedonistic scene, for the Church in recent months. \nIn December Lady Saw, the one-time ‘Queen of the dancehall’ and of slackness (raunchy), debuted her gospel album, “When God Speaks,” at an appearance at VP Records in Miramar. Lady Saw, who now goes by her given name, Marion Hall, was known for her lewd lyrics and raunchy crotch-grabbing stage performances. \n“Being Lady Saw was always a struggle,” she told the Herald in an interview. “Whenever I would perform I would go home and pray.” Formerly known as Lady Saw, she’s now found Jesus. Jacqueline Charles \nBut while Saw’s decision to convert came after attending the funeral of a fellow dancehall artist who died in tragic car accident, Vegas’ came after his own near death experience aboard a Paris-bound flight a week after the French city’s Nov. 13, 2016 terrorists attack. \n“We were two hours into the flight, and the pilot basically came on and said, ‘Put the cigarette out.’ I thought someone was on the plane smoking,” Vegas, who was born Clifford Smith, said in a telephone interview from his native Kingston. “A lot of things started going through my mind. The air masks started coming down, the plane started descending rapidly and then the gentleman sitting beside me said to me, ‘The plane’s wing is on fire.’ “ \n“This is it,” Vegas thought as he began talking to God. “I just started basically saying to myself, “God if you let this plane land, I’m definitely going to do more, dedicate myself to you more.” \nThe plane eventually safely landed. He never forgot his deal with God even though “This is Dancehall” was being received with praise and Billboard named it one of the top 10 reggae albums of 2016. Mr. Vegas \n“When you make a deal with God, you’ve got to keep your side of the deal,” he said. “I’m just trying to be a better person. I just want to be part of Christ and what does Christ represent? Christ represents working hard, and taking care of the poor; loving your neighbor as yourself. These are the things that I embrace as a follower of Christ.” \nBut fans shouldn’t expect Vegas to become a religious zealot, or to completely shelved some of those secular hits that spanned his 20 year career during performances. \n“I personally do not have a problem with dancehall,” he said. “If I were to say dancehall was not good I would be a hypocrite because dancehall is what took me from poverty. How can I look down on something that did good for and is still doing good for me?” \nHis problem, Vegas said, was more his lifestyle, or as he put it “the weakness of the flesh,” and all the drama that came with it. \n“I just wanted to be free from that,” he said.
