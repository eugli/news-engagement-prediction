According to The Hill , Chaffetz has stated that he has no intention of having his committee look into Flynn, and instead will leave it up to the House Intelligence Committee. \nIt has been really sad watching the liberal media freak out about this whole situation and pretend that they cared about things like this when Obama was president. \nLet’s also not forget that Flynn also worked under Obama. \nWe will have to wait and see what happens here. \nClearly, Democrats aren’t going to be quiet on this one. \nThey are going to act like this every step of the way.
