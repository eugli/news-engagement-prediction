Lakers Coach Luke Walton works the sidelines during a game against the Utah Jazz on Jan. 26. (Kim Raff / Associated Press) Tania Ganguli Coach Luke Walton finally connected with Magic Johnson on Monday.\nIt was the first time since Johnson rejoined the Lakers in an advisory role that the two spoke to each other. \n“I was excited to hear that he wants in and wants to grind,” Walton said. “That’s what we need. We need to attack this thing as a group, and hearing that from him was reassuring that he’s willing to put in that time.” \nThe Lakers are in the middle of a 10-day, five-game trip while Staples Center prepares for the Grammy Awards. Walton said when he returns to Los Angeles, and when Johnson’s schedule allows, the two will meet to discuss what his day-to-day role will be with the team. \nIn an interview with Spectrum SportsNet last week, Johnson said he was open to whatever role Walton wanted for him with the players. \nWalton said he looks forward to being able to have Johnson to advise point guard D’Angelo Russell on the position, and advise the 6-foot-9 rookie Brandon Ingram on running an offense at that height. \n“There’s some things that when we talk we might disagree on but you know, remove yourself from the situation, I might say, ‘Hey, if Magic Johnson thinks D’Angelo needs to do this from the point guard position, then let’s change our position on it and roll with that,’” Walton said. “It’s kind of my philosophy in coaching the staff I hired was different personalities and different beliefs in the game of basketball because I like hearing everyone’s opinion and making the final decision from that. Obviously, being able to get his opinion is a valuable one.” \nMetta’s world Tania Ganguli Brandon Ingram had to laugh it off.\nAn airball is one thing, but his airball from the free-throw line on the Lakers ’ first possession drew the unforgiving ire of the crowd at Madison Square Garden on Monday night. \nA different kind of player might have let that start dictate the course of the rest... \nBrandon Ingram had to laugh it off. \nAn airball is one thing, but his airball from the free-throw line on the Lakers ’ first possession drew the unforgiving ire of the crowd at Madison Square Garden on Monday night. \nA different kind of player might have let that start dictate the course of the rest... (Tania Ganguli) \nLate in the Lakers’ double-digit win over the New York Knicks , the crowd turned decidedly one-note. \nThey wanted Metta World Peace in the game. They wouldn’t rest until they had it. \nWith 1 minute 58 seconds left, World Peace checked in at his hometown arena. He hit a 14-foot step-back jumper that sent the crowd into a frenzy. Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony teased him. \n“He was like, ‘They put the old man in,’” World Peace said. “Hey, man, I’m the old man, but I’m in good condition, I can keep up. I keep up.” \nWorld Peace grew up in New York City and played at Madison Square Garden in high school, and also while briefly playing for the Knicks. \nAs a reporter asked if this could be his final time playing at the iconic arena, Lakers forward Larry Nance Jr. shouted from a nearby locker. \n“Two more years!” Nance said. \nWorld Peace liked the sentiment. \n“I can still play, I’m still really good,” he said. “The main thing is I enjoy playing ... as long as I’m having fun. But these guys are really good. Hopefully get the Lakers back to the playoffs and hopefully I can be a part of that ride. But we’ll see.” \nEtc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:01:00.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
