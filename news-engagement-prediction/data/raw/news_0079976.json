Both countries have maintained numerous and diverse areas of partnerships and cooperation in security, exports and imports as well as tourism. We expect more direct investments from the US government, private companies and most importantly, Kenyans in diaspora,” he said. \nIn order to attain and maintain the Category One status, a country must demonstrate compliance with safety standards contained in the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s practices for aircraft operations and maintenance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:06:19.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
