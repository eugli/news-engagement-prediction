In a statement released Tuesday, the NAC said it would place McGregor’s request for a re-hearing on the agenda of its next meeting, March 22. Commission executive director Bob Bennett and chairman Anthony Marnell will recommend to the commissioners that the request is granted, the statement read. McGregor met with Marnell and Bennett on Tuesday in Las Vegas, per the statement. McGregor was fined $75,000, given 50 hours of community service and asked to do a public-service announcement (of $75,000 value) by the NAC in October for his role in a press-conference skirmish with Nate Diaz and his team before UFC 202 . During the press conference in August, Diaz and his team left during the proceedings, walking out toward the back of the Copperfield Theater at the MGM Grand in Vegas. Someone on Diaz’s team threw a bottle at McGregor’s team, sitting below them. That ignited an ugly, water bottle-throwing incident between both sides. Diaz and McGregor both threw bottles toward each other and McGregor also chucked an energy drink can. Diaz was fined $50,000 and asked to complete 50 hours of community service by the commission in December for his role in the kerfuffle. If McGregor’s punishment changes, the NAC would look again at Diaz’s discipline and discuss a new settlement to make it equal, Bennett told MMA Fighting’s Ariel Helwani on Tuesday. Bennett also said that McGregor’s attempt to apply for a boxing license did come up during the conversation Tuesday, but Floyd Mayweather’s name was not mentioned. Bennett said he would “cross that bridge when we get there,” when asked if the commission would sanction that boxing match. McGregor’s application for a boxing license in Nevada has been held up, because he was pursuing judicial review of his commission sanctions from the press-conference incident. At UFC 202, McGregor, then the UFC featherweight champion, ended up beating Diaz by majority decision. “The Notorious” went on to beat Eddie Alvarez to win the UFC lightweight title at UFC 205 in November, to become the only fighter in UFC history to hold titles in two weight classes at the same time.
