Thank God we have another opportunity to seek justice at the Supreme Court, which I believe will not be delayed or denied. \n“The party will appeal the judgement as we believe in the ability of the judiciary to do justice, however we plead with our members, leaders and supporters to calm down as we keep hope alive. \n“If this is a price to pay, to keep our democracy alive and opposition strengthened, we are prepared to go the whole hug.” \nHe added that the party organs would meet soon and take concrete steps and decisions on the way forward. \nChairman of the BoT, Senator Walid Jibrin, also said that organs of the party would soon meet on the judgement, saying that the governors, the BoT, and other organs of the PDP “are behind Makarfi and its committee. ”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:43:33.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
