The app has announced a game-changing update. The app, on Monday, rolled out a new feature called ‘Status’, a new tab for sharing photos, videos, and GIF’s that will disappear after 24 hours. \n“We are excited to announce that, coinciding with WhatsApp's 8th birthday on February 24, we are reinventing the status feature. Starting today, we are rolling out an update to status, which allows you to share photos and videos with your friends and contacts on WhatsApp in an easy and secure way. Yes, even your status updates are end-to-end encrypted”, said Jan Koum, the CEO and co-founder of WhatsApp in the chat messenger's blog. \nJust like eight years ago when we first started WhatsApp, this new and improved status feature will let you keep your friends who use WhatsApp easily updated in a fun and simple way. From all of us at WhatsApp, we hope you enjoy it, added Koum. \nThe new Status feature will replace the eight-year-old basic “text only” status feature in WhatsApp. \nWhatsApp said the feature would roll out to users from Monday 20 Feb., and would be “available soon around the world for iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone users.” \nFirst Published: Tuesday, February 21, 2017 - 09:17 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:09:57.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
