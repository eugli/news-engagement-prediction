Rushing, 64, a retired city employee, had just left a 7-Eleven on West Colonial Drive when an Orlando police officer pulled him over. When she looked inside the car, Officer Shelby Riggs-Hopkins spotted something suspicious on the floorboard - pieces of a 'rock-like' substance. She conducted a field drug test. The results: methamphetamine. She handcuffed Rushing and took him to jail. It turned out the 'methamphetamine' were pieces of glaze that had fallen off a Krispie Kreme Doughnut. The Orlando Police officer who arrested a man after mistaking doughnut glaze for methamphetamine resigned a week after she was reprimanded for making false arrest.\nCpl. Shelby Riggs-Hopkins, who worked with the department for about a decade, left her job on Jan 22 to be a stay-at-home mom.\nRiggs-Hopkins in December 2015 arrested Daniel Rushing, 65, after she spotted what she thought were drugs on the floorboard of his car. Police spotted him at a 7-11 they’d been monitoring after receiving complaints about drug activity, the Orlando Sentinel re ported .\nRiggs-Hopkins pulled Rushing over and saw a rocky, white substance inside his vehicle.\n“I kept telling them, ‘That’s ... glaze from a doughnut,” Rushing told the newspaper. “They tried to say it was crack cocaine at first, then they said, ‘No, it’s meth, crystal meth.’”\nRiggs-Hopkins administered three road-side drugs tests — one turned up negative for cocaine while the other two, performed incorrectly, tested positive.\nRushing was strip searched and spent hours in jail before being released on $2,500 bond. A few weeks later lab tests revealed the substance was indeed a sugary glaze and not drugs, according to the newspaper.\nDeputy Chief Orlando Rolon admitted after the incident Riggs-Hopkins, nor any of the officers had been trained on how to use the drug test kits.\nSince the wrongful arrest, 737 officers have completed the training, with only a couple dozen new hires still waiting to learn how to use the kits, the Sentinel reported.\nRiggs-Hopkins was given a written reprimand for making an improper arrest. They found no evidence she acted in bad faith.\nRushing is now suing the city and the manufacturer of the drug test kits.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-doughnut-glaze-mistaken-for-meth-cop-disciplined-20170209-story.html", "http://www.nydailynews.com/"], "published": "2017-02-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T11:31:25.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
