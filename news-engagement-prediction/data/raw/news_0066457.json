It was time for celebration for their fans. Fans who were missing stars of the mid-2000s got the news of Keerti Gaekwad Kelkar making a comeback with the hit show Sasural Simar Ka. Nach Baliye 8 made news every day with new names on the judging and contestants list. Here is a look at who made news… \nKeerti Gaekwad Kelkar After a span of six years, Keerti Kelkar will be back on screen as Simar in Sasural Simar Ka. The actress who is married to Sharad Kelkar was on a sabbatical enjoying being a mom to Kesha. Keerti was last seen on the Marathi show Mann Udhan Varyache. She has done a few films too. Keerti feels it is a huge responsibility to play a successful character like Simar but it is very excited for her comeback after such a long hiatus.

He said that they had only begun dating recently, though he was yet to take her out on an official date, due to their erratic schedules. The actor said they weren’t dating at the time when the first rumours surfaced. In fact, a portal had reported that Shivangi’s mom was not happy with her daughter’s growing fondness for Mohsin but the two had trashed the news. We can guess that everything is fine in paradise now.

The petite singer was given a ‘kind’ suggestion on Instagram to wear more appropriate clothes befitting her stature as a mentor on the show. The person said her short outfits made the show kind of uncomfortable. Furious, Monali vented her anger on the person through social media warning him/her that he would get a kick on the b***s if he ever faced her. \nKaran Kundraa Fans of Roadies were in for a huge disappointment when Karan Kundraa announced that he would not be a part of Roadies Rising. The hottie made news when he slapped a guy during the auditions and threw another one out. Karan has got an assignment in London, which is bigger than what he has done before. \nNach Baliye 8 This season of Nach Baliye 8 is promising to be huge with a star-studded line-up of contestants that include Divyanka Tripathi-Vivek Dahiya, Keith Sequeira-Rochelle Maria Rao, Karam Rajpal – Shivaleeka Oberoi amongst others. Finally, the judging trio is confirmed with Terence Lewis, Sonakshi Sinha and Saroj Khan. Mona Lisa of Bigg Boss 10 fame also shared a rehearsal video. Moreover, Suyyash Rai and Kishwer Merchant refused the show much to the disappointment of their fans. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T14:35:37.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
