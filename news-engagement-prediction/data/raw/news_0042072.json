On CBC Radio One's In the Key of C , we try to highlight some of our favourites each week.\nYou can hear the show live every Saturday evening at 5 p.m. ET on CBC Radio One in Ontario. In the Key of C can be heard across the province, except for in the GTA. Hamilton listeners can hear the segment in the player above. ​\nNew Love: Every Lie\n<a href=\"http://newlove.bandcamp.com/album/close-ep\">Close - EP by New Love</a> This tune from New Love is from the band's new EP, Close .\nThe drive and the backbeat on this track make it immediately stand out. It has a similar feel to Japandroids, though with a fuller sound (what with a full band as opposed to a duo).\nThe vocals here are top notch, too.\nOdd Years: Troubadour\nThis new track from Odd Years has a real classic sort of sound — it reminds me of Badfinger, for some reason.\nThis group features members from Cuff The Duke, Minotaurs and Lowlands, so it's not surprising that they're surging right out of the gate with the polish that you can hear here.\nMax the Lesser: Luau\n<a href=\"http://lootbagrecords.bandcamp.com/album/valentines-forever-mixtape-lll\">Valentines Forever : Mixtape lll by Max The Lesser</a> Max the Lesser's Luau doesn't sound like any sort of Hawaiian party that I've ever been to.\nIt's definitely one of the more sombre tracks to feature a ukulele. It's definitely eclectic, but also sticks with you long after listening to it.\nAnyone who enjoys The Postal Service will find something to like here.\nWant your new track to be featured on In the Key of C?
