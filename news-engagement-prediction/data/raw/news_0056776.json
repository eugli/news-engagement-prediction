But with each, Mr. Barker said, there was ample reason to believe awards chatter could be in reach. Photo John Goodman in “10 Cloverfield Lane.” He did not get an Oscar nod. Credit Michele K. Short/Paramount Pictures Ms. Sarandon was critically lauded for “The Meddler,” he noted, and might have made some headway were it not for the unusually stiff competition for best actress this year. (Whether a Clintonista Hollywood would have embraced an avowed supporter of Bernie Sanders and then Jill Stein is another matter.) “This is the strongest year for actress I’ve ever seen,” Mr. Barker said. “If it had been one of those years when it was difficult for people to remember five great performances from actresses, someone like Susan Sarandon would get in there.” “The Hollars” left audiences largely unmoved, but Ms. Martindale earned warm reviews, well justifying a push, Mr. Barker said. Yet “I Saw the Light” was roundly deemed a stinker; didn’t any notion of awards strain credulity? No, Mr. Barker said. “Tom Hiddleston’s performance was at the forefront as well,” he added. Even the film’s detractors noted Mr. Hiddleston’s performance was solid and, admittedly, the studio’s “push” was relatively modest: The Bagger received a screener and a promotional flier. Yet for even the most seasoned strategist, it can be hard to forecast what film or performance may break through. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Studios also might not know what they have. Among the more famous entries in the annals of “ye who have little faith” is the initial treatment of “Slumdog Millionaire” by Warner Bros. The studio was considering sending the picture straight to DVD but instead entered a distribution deal with Fox Searchlight and ended up with a smash hit that went on to win eight Academy Awards . This year had its fair share of surprise Oscar nominees defying predictions. Among them: Viggo Mortensen, nominated for best actor for his role in the eccentric indie hit “Captain Fantastic”; “Passengers,” which was panned but landed two nominations, including one for best score; and “The Lobster,” sometimes described as the year’s weirdest film , which is up for best original screenplay. And lest anyone raise an eyebrow over suggestions that Mr. Goodman deserved attention for the sci-fi “10 Cloverfield Lane,” the Bagger would like to point out — one last time! — all the chatter generated by the season’s darkest of horses, “Deadpool.” If an R-rated comedy about a pervy, sarcastic and disfigured action figure can find itself on the awards trail , someone like Mr. Goodman had every reason to hope.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:26:19.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
