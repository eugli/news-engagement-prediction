This is actually a very tough decision, probably a couple of years ago I would have said Zac Efron, but now I’d say Harry Styles.” \nShe had the audience cracking up throughout the game, which continued with images of Nick Jonas, Brad Pitt, The Weeknd, Chris Martin, and more. \nEach one was rejected in favour of Harry Styles, until Lenny Kravitz popped up and the ex-One Direction star’s run finally came to an end.

It’s not like you have to be younger. It’s not about that. I just meet people and then if I go out with them, I go out with them. And if I like them, I like them. And if I don’t, I don’t. It’s about the person. It’s about who they are. It has nothing to do with age.” \nGot a story? email or call us direct on 02077824220", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:01:06.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
