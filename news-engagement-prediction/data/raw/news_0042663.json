It will be six months or more before any crops are ready, and then only if there is rain. \nEveryone hopes that rain will come in April and May, allowing crops to be planted for harvest in August. The people of Yirol would rather do this than rely on food aid. \nBut unless they get food now, the women who are usually responsible for tilling the land (as well as fetching water, cooking, washing and childcare) will be too weak to do so.

From Juba she walked over 200 miles to Yirol with her five children, the eldest of whom is seven, carrying her youngest child in her arms. \nMonica showed me the kwor leaves she picks from bushes in the forest and boils to feed her children once a day. When this supply runs out later this month [February], she fears there will be nothing left to eat. \nThe United Nations estimates that more than 3.4 million people – almost one in every three South Sudanese – have been forced to flee their homes since the conflict began, including nearly 1.9 million internally displaced people and 1.5 million refugees in neighbouring countries.
