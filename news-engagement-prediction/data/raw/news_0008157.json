Share United haven't won in the Premier League since January 2 Share \nManchester United face Hull for the fourth and final time this season and their first defeat to the Tigers since 1974 last week was well timed. \nUnited, horrendous at the KC Stadium, still progressed through to the EFL Cup final and at a time when their performance level was dwindling, the 2-1 reverse maybe reinforced their focus ahead of tonight's match. \nEspecially since Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham all dropped points last night. United, marooned in sixth, could still stay there if they beat Hull but victory will take them to within three points of second-placed Spurs. \nUnited have not won a Premier League game since January 2 and the prime reason why they remain sixth is their draws column. There have been eight this season and United could have comfortably won over half of them. \nAs Jose Mourinho said, only three points is a good result this evening. Key Events 16:20 Certain starters for tonight \nMourinho has said Valencia, Pogba, Mkhitaryan and Ibrahimovic will all line-up this evening. You might as well add the peerless De Gea to that list, too. So that’s five. 16:15 Raiola: Ibrahimovic loves Naples \nHe told Radio Crc: \n“As for Ibrahimovic, he’s always been in love with Naples and the passion of the Neapolitans and I’ve always said that openly because he grew up in a family which was similar to the Neapolitans and then with me. \n“He knows what the love of the Neapolitans means and that passion has always attracted him. \n“I know that [Napoli president Aurelio] De Laurentiis knows him, and with Zlatan you never know what could happen.” \nRaiola actually regards Neapolitan as his mother language, rather than Italian or Dutch (he grew up in the Netherlands). Raiola could broker three United transfers this summer 16:04 \nMata Mkhitaryan \nIbrahimovic \nThat’s based on Mourinho’s insistence Martial won’t start and who turned up at The Lowry today. \n“I think the players pick themselves,” Mourinho said yesterday. 16:03 Glimpse of Mourinho's programme notes \nHe has a 25-man squad to choose from and everyone is available. 15:59 \nPick the team you want to see start tonight below. \nRemember, Martial definitely isn’t starting. 15:51 Pogba's new hairstyle for tonight \nWarren Joyce only said last week he should cut out the silly haircuts. Pogba has done the opposite - as he is entitled to. \nIf he doesn’t perform tonight he’ll get a fair bit more stick. (Photo: Eamonn and James Clarke) 15:40 Ferdinand's criticism of Lingard and Pogba \nThere are some valid points. Certain United players are in danger of becoming a bit ‘Arsenal’, as Ferdinand referenced. United don’t want to get a reputation for hollow flashiness and underachieving while taking selfies and looking daft in videos. \nThat said, there might be an ulterior motive. Ferdinand tried to get Lingard on board to promote a new business venture to do with baseball caps, yet Lingard has overseen the release of his own branded caps (which include a silhouette of him dabbing). \nMaybe, just maybe, Ferdinand saw an opportunity to take Lingard down a peg over that. 15:34 Confirmed United squad members vs Hull \nHere is a list of those who were at The Lowry. \nOne player had his hood pulled up and was unidentifiable. Suspect it could be Young after what Mourinho said yesterday.
