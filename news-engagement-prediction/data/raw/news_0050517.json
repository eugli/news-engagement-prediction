Nazeem breaks down as he talks about Australians helping each other in the wake of the Lindt cafe siege. Source: Channel 10 \n“So, that was horrific. It was very frightening for a lot of people. My sister texted me [that day] and said, ‘Nazeem, I’m scared to wear the hijab home, because I’m afraid someone’s going to attack me.’” \nAs the siege went on, and with widespread fear that Muslim Australians would be subjected to harassment or attack regarding the siege, the “#Illridewithyou” hashtag started trending as people pledged to sit with Muslims on public transport to help them feel safe. \n“She messaged me later on saying, “You know what? I now feel comfortable and safe knowing my fellow Australians are willing to stand up and support me,’” says Hussain, his voice breaking. \n“It made me cry when that happened, because we don’t see that enough. We don’t see Australians coming together for each other. That man [Monis]wanted to divide Australia — he wanted us to turn on each other. But what he did instead is make us come together,” he continues. Tziporah Malkah — who had previously praised Pauline Hanson — looks on. Source: Channel 10 \n“I always think, what’s going to happen to us? Are we just going to become what ISIS wants us to become — a world where there’s Muslim and non-Muslim? When Pauline Hanson says things irresponsibly, she’s doing what ISIS is doing — splitting up Muslim and non-Muslim,” says Hussain, who argues that Australians are, by their nature, not prone to such division. \n“What happens time and again — and this shows the Australian spirit — is we use these opportunities to strengthen bonds.” \nHussain’s campmates listened intently as he shared his story — among them, vocal Pauline Hanson supporter Tziporah Malkah. The pair had previously sparred when a discussion about the Middle East turned heated. \nI’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here screens 7:30pm tonight on Ten.
