Getty \nThe Merriam-Webster Twitter account has claimed its newest victim: Counselor to President Donald Trump Kellyanne Conway. \nOn Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Conway ‚Äï a woman whose career has greatly benefited from the work feminists have done ‚Äï said that she is ‚Äúnot about‚Äù identifying as a feminist . But Conway seems to be a bit confused about what the word actually means. \n‚ÄúFor me, it‚Äôs difficult to call myself a feminist in the classic sense because it seems to be very anti-male,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd it certainly is very pro-abortion in this context. And I‚Äôm not anti-male or pro-abortion.‚Äù \nHowever, Merriam-Webster was quick to rectify her misunderstanding. The dictionary tweeted the following on Thursday afternoon: üìà'Feminism' is defined as \"the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities.\" https://t.co/Zjf7CAPUjL \nFeminism, the tweet reads, is: ‚Äúthe belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities.‚Äù \nBoom. The Multiple Facets Of Modern Feminism The Multiple Facets Of Modern Feminism 1 10 The Family Feminists: Beyonc√© (aka Mrs Carter) Taking the same path as Lily Rose Cooper, Beyonc√© was derided by female critics when she announced she would be touring under her married name, Mrs Carter. But the star, who has made a name for herself singing about female empowerment, insists she is not compromising her feminist sensibilities. She told Vogue in a recent interview: \"I guess I am a modern-day feminist. I do believe in equality. Why do you have to choose what type of woman you are? Why do you have to label yourself anything? I‚Äôm just a woman and I love being a woman,\" she said. \"I do believe in equality and that we have a way to go and it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs pushed aside and something that we have been conditioned to accept.\" She defended her decision to pay homage to her husband, Shawn Carter (Jay-Z): \"I feel like Mrs Carter is who I am, but more bold and more fearless than I've ever been. \"It comes from knowing my purpose and really meeting myself once I saw my child. I was like, 'OK, this is what you were born to do'. The purpose of my body became completely different.\" Share this slide:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:34:22.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
