Since then, multiple players have echoed his sentiment. \nWhile it’s unlikely Tom Brady will join these ranks , here is a running list of Patriots players not attending: Martellus Bennett Icon Sportswire via Getty Images “I will not be going,” Bennett said . “It is what it is. People know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter.” The player said at a prior date that he doesn’t “ support the guy in the house .” Devin McCourty Bob Levey via Getty Images The free safety said he would not be attending because he doesn't feel \"accepted\" by the Trump administration . “I’m not going to the White House,” McCourty told TIME. “Basic reason for me is I don’t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won’t.” Dont'a Hightower Mike Ehrmann via Getty Images The linebacker replied simply that he's \"been there, done that\" when it comes to post–Super Bowl White House visits. He previously skipped a meet-and-greet with President Barack Obama. LeGarrette Blount Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Blount said he's skipping the event because he \"doesn't feel welcome.\" “I just don’t feel welcome into that house,” the running back said . “I’m just gonna leave it at that.” Chris Long Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Defensive end Chris Long tweeted that he will not be going to the White House after a New York Daily News open letter urged him to not attend . \"Planned on skipping, hadn't been asked. Don't need an open letter explaining my own words to me. Not *joining* anyone. My call,\" he wrote. Alan Branch Icon Sportswire via Getty Images The defensive tackle will be spending time with his family instead of hanging out with Trump. “I’m just going to hang out with the family and continue celebrating until the next season starts,” he told radio host Alex Marvez.
