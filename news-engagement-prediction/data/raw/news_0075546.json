'Once we got to the ground, he started pushing and fighting me, and I hit him one time.'\n'Once I had him, he wasn't going anywhere,' he told ABC 7 . Burch said there were already several of his tools in the alleged thief's car.\nBrian Burch, above, of Fort Myers, says he's been practicing Brazilian Jui-Jitsu for two and a half years\nOrtiz, above, looked worse for wear after Burch let him have it in his garage when he says he caught him stealing\nBurch said he's been training in the martial arts for two and a half years. He practices Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which is a form of martial arts and combat sport that focuses on bringing your opponent down to the ground and grappling.\nA neighbor saw the commotion and called police, who arrived to arrest Ortiz.\n'[The police] told him he got exactly what he deserved,' said Burch. 'I'm just glad he's not on the street anymore and can't hit anybody else's home.'\nOrtiz did one thing right at least - he didn't allegedly break in when Burch's kids were home. 'Then I would have been even angrier,' Burch said.\nNeighbors did not feel sorry for the beaten Ortiz.\n'The fact that he manhandled him maybe, I think it's well deserved,' said neighbor Darlene Donovan.\nAnother neighbor thought the thief was crazy to try anything with Burch. 'He's not a little guy,' he said of his neighbor.\nOrtiz is charged with burglary and grand theft and was last known to still be in jail.\n'He's not a little guy' said the neighbor of the muscular Burch, who practices a martial arts style that is heavy on floor grappling\nBlood can be seen on the drive leading up to Burch's garage, suspect Ortiz sitting down in front after meeting up with Burch\nBurch said the suspect had already taken some tools out of his garage (above) and put them in his car\nBrian Burch, above, was not going to stand by and watch his tools be taken by a thief", "external_links": ["http://www.abc-7.com/story/34591230/fort-myers-homeowner-beats-up-burglar", "http://www.nbc-2.com/story/34588442/fort-myers-homeowner-uses-jiu-jitsu-skills-on-burglar"], "published": "2017-02-24T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T09:01:17.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
