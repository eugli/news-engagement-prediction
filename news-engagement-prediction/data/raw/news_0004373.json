Forbes, jforbes@post-dispatch.com \nTwo people were hurt Thursday morning when a woman trying to park in front of a Great Clips in South County instead accelerated into the hair salon. \nThe car ended up about 40 feet inside the salon, at 4253 Bayless Avenue, near the South County Goodwill store. \nRaymond Elliott, 26, an employee at the Subway restaurant directly next door to the salon, was sitting in his car before 11 a.m. smoking a cigarette and witnessed the crash. \nElliott said the woman tried to park in the parking space directly in front of the Great Clips when she apparently gunned her engine and her vehicle drove over the parking curb and crashed through the entrance into the salon. \nBewildered, Elliott heard screams coming from inside the business and ran in to help. He saw a female employee partially trapped underneath the white Lincoln Town Car and another employee lying on the hood of the vehicle. \nElliott was given a box cutter from a Subway co-worker and was able to cut the trapped employee's shirt to help free her from under the vehicle. Paramedics arrived and placed a neck brace on the woman that had been trapped. \nPolice said two people inside the salon had minor injuries. \nThe driver of the vehicle was evaluated by paramedics then left with a man who arrived to check on her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T13:35:15.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
