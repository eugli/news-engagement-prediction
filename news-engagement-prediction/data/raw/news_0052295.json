In metro Denver, immigrants are estimated to have $6.9 billion in spending power, according to the report. They make up 12.5 percent of the metro-Denver population, and in 2014 they paid $2.3 billion in state and local taxes. Coloradans for Immigration Reform– a coalition of 12 business trade organizations and… more Image provided by Getty Images (Zerbor) The Partnership for a New American Economy, backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , today launched its Map of Impact, which breaks down data by state and congressional district. The group, described as bipartisan, has been pushing for immigration reform for several years, but the issue has heated up with executive orders on immigration from President Trump. Jeff Wasden , chairman of the Colorado Business Roundtable, said Coloradans for Immigration Reform — a coalition of 12 business trade organizations and chamber of commerce groups – want responsible and compassionate immigration reform. “Our legal immigration system is a disaster,” he said. “When Congress does not act and take leadership you get presidents who use executive orders to address this issue.” Today the Department of Homeland Security released documents with the rules for President Trump’s executive orders on immigration and border security. The New York Times reports that now immigration agents, customs officers and border patrol agents have been directed to remove any undocumented immigrant convicted of any criminal offense, not just serious offenses as detailed under President Obama . Colorado business owner Andrea Guendelman , who is originally from South America, said the president's executive order has created a climate of uncertainty and persecution. She started her business, Be Visible, a career platform for Latinos, about two years ago. \"We saw that Latinos had not been involved in anything political,\" she said. \"But this issue has drawn them out. They feel a deep sense of justice. Their parents came here to get them a better education. They've done everything right and they feel this unfairness.\" Some of her clients are in the U.S. under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, and worry that the new deportation policy would affect them. Being in the country undocumented is an illegal act, she said. \"If the president was really serious about restricting immigration, he would go to the people who have the power – the businesses that employ immigrants,\" Guendelman said. Chad Vorthmann, executive vice president of the Colorado Farm Bureau, said immigration reform should not be based on fear. His organization is part of the Colorado coalition and wants to see changes in guest-worker programs. Agriculture is the second largest contributor in the Colorado economy and supports about 173,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, providing about 2.4 percent of the state’s earned income, or about $5 billion. And there are more than 35,000 farms in the state. But between 2002 and 2014, the number of crop workers in the state decreased by 36 percent. “We have situations, folks on Western slope with sheep. They bring in herders from South America and they are people who come over and over,” Vorthmann said. “They are familiar with the operations.” But every year, the farmers are nervous about whether the temporary workers will be able to come back. It’s a paperwork and logjam issue, he said. \"That feeling has been there for several years, but there is more concern now with the actions taken federally,\" Vorthmann said. There needs to be a streamlined system that gets the guest workers where they want to go in a timely manner, he said. “We should care from a business community standpoint,” he said. “When you look at immigration in double digits, and every industry is looking for consumers or a margin, one change in it, and it affects [the] bottom lines of everyone.” In Denver, according to the Partnership for New American Economy, there are 342,509 foreign-born residents who make up 12.5 percent of the area’s population. Immigrants paid $2.3 billion in state and local taxes and held $6.9 billion in spending power in 2014. Immigrants are 1.1 percent more likely to be entrepreneurs than the native population. There are 20,857 immigrant entrepreneurs in Denver. Immigrants own 63,804 homes and help to build the area’s housing wealth. Immigrants make up 29.6 percent of the construction industry, 23.5 percent of the administrative support industry, and 18 percent of the manufacturing industry. Walden said the national discussion on immigration should include how to recruit and retain highly skilled immigrants. “This new research proves what we’ve known for years: immigrants are a boon to our local economy and in every community in America,” Wasden said. “If we modernize the system, our country stands to benefit.\" Monica Mendoza covers banking and financial services, legal services, retail, the economy and economic development, and sports business.
