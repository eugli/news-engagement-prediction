From freshman year, the kid known as \"O-Dog\" talked often about becoming a Navy SEAL, a member of the elite, rugged combat unit.\nOn Saturday, Owens, 36, originally from Peoria, was killed in Yemen during a raid against al-Qaida .\n\"People might have thought it was just a kid talking,\" high school friend Cody Jackson recalled Tuesday. \"But he meant every word of it. He always talked about the greatest thing he could do was serve his country.\"\nJackson spoke of the friend who used to walk into Jackson's family home and go directly for the refrigerator. Owens also was the friend who obtained the Navy SEAL training program and worked out early in the morning while Jackson slept.\nHe played baseball and football and competed on those teams for Illinois Valley Central's Gray Ghosts. Owens also enjoyed fishing and deer hunting around Chillicothe, the Illinois River town about 140 miles southwest of Chicago.\nJackson said Owens lived in Chillicothe during high school. He graduated from IVC in May 1998, school officials said, and enlisted in the Navy in August that year.\nU.S. sailor killed during Yemen raid was from Peoria Tribune news services The Defense Department announced Monday that the U.S. Navy sailor killed during a raid on al-Qaida base in Yemen was from Peoria, Illinois.Chief Special Warfare Operator William \"Ryan\" Owens died Jan. 28 of wounds sustained during the raid.The Pentagon said Owens, 36, was assigned to an East Coast-based...\nThe Defense Department announced Monday that the U.S. Navy sailor killed during a raid on al-Qaida base in Yemen was from Peoria, Illinois.Chief Special Warfare Operator William \"Ryan\" Owens died Jan. 28 of wounds sustained during the raid.The Pentagon said Owens, 36, was assigned to an East Coast-based...\n(Tribune news services) \"Sometimes you needed to refocus him a little,\" said Owens' former high school history teacher and baseball coach Steve Garrison, \"but he was always a very nice, polite young man. You could get on him and then give him a hug five minutes later.\"\nLike Jackson, Garrison recalled that Owens \"was always good for a laugh,\" and well-liked. \"He wasn't a star\" on the sophomore baseball team that Garrison coached, \"but he was a good, steady player who did everything you wanted him to do,\" the former coach said. Owens played catcher, Garrison recalled.\nHe returned to the area a couple of times, Garrison and Jackson said; once a couple years after graduation and right before SEAL training and a second time for a 10-year-high school class reunion. His family also had moved from the Peoria area years ago.\nIn a statement, Rear Admiral Tim Szymanski, commander of all SEALs, called Owens \"an exceptional SEAL â€” an experienced warrior and a highly respected teammate who served silently, nobly and bravely through several combat deployments. Ryan's legacy strengthens our own resolve and commitment to this crucial fight. We hope his family can find comfort in the love and support of Family, Friends and Teammates.\"\nU.S. service member's death in Yemen is the first under Trump Tribune news services The U.S. military said Sunday that one service member was killed and three others wounded in a raid in Yemen targeting its local al-Qaida branch, marking the first-known combat death of a member of the U.S. military under President Donald Trump.

When Owens' death became known, Trump said, \"My deepest thoughts and humblest prayers are with the family of this fallen service member.\"\nThree other service members were wounded during the firefight with militants from al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula of Yemen. A fourth U.S. service member was injured when a military aircraft assisting in the mission nearby had a \"hard landing.\" The raid left 30 others dead, including an estimated 14 militants.\nFormal memorial plans are not set and will likely not be made public, a Navy spokesman said.
