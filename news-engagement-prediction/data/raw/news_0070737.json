Editor Advertisement \nForeign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan was quoted in reports yesterday as having came out and said that ASEAN is set on completing a set of framework for a code of conduct on maritime disputes to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea. \nHe was obviously referring to China. He even said that no one can control the agenda of the superpower. He is very right in that count. No one can control China, least of all a Minister well known in Singapore for not being able to control the Youth Olympic budget. Now he target China in his speech, although in the capacity of an ASEAN Ministerial meeting. \nThe last time a Singapore Minister, Prime Minister no less, said something challenging China's authority, our Terrexes were impounded. Big mouth Minister Vivian had opened his mouth, what next will be impounded now. \nPaul D \nA.S.S.
