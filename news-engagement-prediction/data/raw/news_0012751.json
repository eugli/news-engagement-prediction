According to him, the Minister could still do her mandatory one-year national service which even as she serves as a minister of state. Otiko Djaba during her vetting by Parliament’s Appointments Committee on Monday [January 30], said she did not do her national service because she was outside the country. Her confession has sparked a public debate with many arguing parliament must not approve her for the ministerial portfolio. The Ghana National Service Scheme Act 426 section 7 states that, a person who has not commenced and completed his or her period of national service shall not; (a) obtain employment outside the Scheme; or (b) be employed by any other person outside the Scheme; or (c) be engaged in any employment outside the Scheme, whether self-employed or otherwise, without the prior permission, in writing, of the Board. (2) It shall be the duty of every employer to ascertain from every employee, upon his appointment, whether or not he is liable to national service and if he is, the employer shall notify the fact to the Board forthwith. But speaking on TV3’s New Day show on Saturday, Dr Francis Agyenim Boateng stated that Otiko must be show good leadership by doing her national service in her assigned ministry and accepting to take the salary of a national service person for a year even as she serves as a substantive minister.
