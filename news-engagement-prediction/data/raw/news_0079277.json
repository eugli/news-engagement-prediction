Lakers forward Brandon Ingram goes up for a dunk on Spurs forward Pau Gasol at Staples Center on Sunday. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) Tania Ganguli saw signs of what they want to see more often from their first-round pick, Brandon Ingram .\nThey saw an aggression with which Ingram doesn’t always play. \n“Sometimes I shy away from it a little bit,” Ingram said. “[Sunday night] I did a good job.” \nIngram had his first career 20-point game Sunday against the San Antonio Spurs . His 22 points and 10 field goals were both career highs. He hasn’t been the type of player to take over games at any point this season, but that doesn’t worry the Lakers. As his coaches work on his physicality, the proper way to take contact and an attacking mentality, they believe they’ll see more of this from Ingram. \n“He’ll figure it out,” Lakers Coach Luke Walton said. “We’re very confident that, from what we see every day in practice, he’s gonna be a successful player in this league. We’ll keep pushing him and keep putting him in positions to succeed and to fail, and he’ll keep figuring it out. When he gets it, he’ll get it.” \nUnderstanding contact, and how he can use it to his advantage, is part of the learning process for Ingram. Team executive Magic Johnson worked with him last week on techniques that would make things easier for him on offense. But that’s also something Lakers assistant Brian Keefe , who works individually with Ingram, has helped him learn. \n“It’s understanding to use your body, knowing when the contact’s coming, knowing when you can be the player that initiates the contact to get your defender off balance, then obviously getting stronger yourself,” Walton said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:19:27.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
