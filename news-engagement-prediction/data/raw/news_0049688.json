SIMON O'CONNOR/Fairfax NZ \nAn Americarna pre-cruise event offered a private look at Bryce Barnett's classic car collection in Brixton. \nOnly a small portion of those attended a pre-cruise tour of Barnett's two garages of classic cars. \n\"Usually the ladies take to the gardens and the guys look at the cars,\" groundsman Murry Fabish said. \nREAD MORE: â€‹ * Americarna's 10th anniversary to bring influx of visitors to Taranaki SIMON O'CONNOR \nWhile most found it difficult to choose a favourite automobile, the choice was easy for Barnett's son Reeve. \nThe vibrant blue 1937 factory built Cord Beverly \"just has the best lines, I reckon,\" he said. \nReeve said there were only 160 of its kind left in the world and it was full of quirks. SIMON O'CONNOR/Fairfax NZ \nThe seven acre garden in Brixton was an ideal spot to play croquet and check out classic cars. \nSuch as the backward opening \"suicide doors\", and the small crank by the left-handed steering wheel to wind the headlights open. Reeve said his family often showed off the collection, even allowing friends and family to take the cars out for sunny Sunday cruises down the coast. \n\"They're not just for show. The best way they're displayed is out on the road,\" he said. SIMON O'CONNOR/Stuff.co.nz \nThose who signed up for the pre-cruise tour enjoyed the close-up peek into history and Reeve said the visit to the seven acre Te Kukumara property was always a hit. \n\"They're usually quite surprised by what's in here. People always love it.\" \nAs Americarna entrants geared up for the four-day festival, Valerie Payne of Paraparaumu smiled from ear to ear and announced it was her first year to attend the event. SIMON O'CONNOR/Fairfax NZ \nThe 1937 factory built Cord Beverly is Reeve Barnett's favourite car to cruise around in. \n\"I'm going to eat, drink and sleep America,\" she said, as she displayed her 1958 Ford Fairlane. \n\"American cars are loud, wild and just awesome.\" \nThe TSB Stadium offered American-themed merchandise to entrants while enthusiasts donning cowboy hats and American flag singlets talked shop in the carpark. SIMON O'CONNOR/Fairfax NZ \nThe 1932 Chrysler Six CM had a top spot on the lawn of Bryce Barnett's Te Kukumara property. \n\"I've made every year except the first,\" Lee Atkinson of Wellington said. \n\"It's a great event and everyone is so friendly.\" \nAs Atkinson roared the engine of his white 2012 SS Camaro, he spoke of his favourite part of American culture: \"cars and rock and roll\". SIMON O'CONNOR/Fairfax NZ \nSharon Clarry, Jen Busby, Lara Phillips, Nicky Smith, Darlene Gibson and Michelle Clarry of Egmont Village brought the party to TSB's carpark, revving up for the official first day on Wednesday.
