Man 'tried to have sex with drain cover' \n\"Whilst the Black Power Wand complies with all necessary safety testing standards and legal regulations, we have made a voluntary decision to recall the product from all channels in November 2016 due to a very small number of isolated reports concerning the wires in the cord of the Black Power Wand. \n\"Our product development team have been working closely with trading standards, who are fully aware and supportive of the precautionary recall.\" \n\"We continue to ensure all customers affected are reimbursed with a full refund and our customer care teams are available to answer any concerns or queries,\" she said.
