McDonald's/YouTube \nSo with help from some aerospace engineers, the company is introducing a new type of beverage transfer tool: the STRAW, or \"Suction Tube for Reverse Axial Withdrawal.” \nThe new straw has a fish-hook shaped design with holes at various points to allow the correct ratio of each flavor of shake into its cylinder. McDonald’s claims the new tubular design required advanced fluid dynamics simulations before being fine-tuned to provide the perfect amounts of mint and chocolate goodness. \nIt’s all a bit silly. The company even calls the new straw, “spectacularly unnecessary” in a purposefully cringeworthy promo video. \nNecessary or not, the new straw will be available in limited quantities at select locations alongside the company’s three new 'Shamrock-infused' shakes. \nA list of participating McDonald’s locations can be found on the company’s website if you want to be one of the lucky few to drink out of this incredibly advanced product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:03:54.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
