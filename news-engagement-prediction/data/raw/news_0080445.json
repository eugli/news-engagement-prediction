(Facebook/Anja Nissen) Australian-born and raised singer Anja Nissen has won a Danish competition to represent that country in the Eurovision Song Contest. Source: Tweet \nTwo Australians will be competing in this year's Eurovision Song Contest after NSW-born Anja Nissen beat nine other finalists for the right to represent Denmark. \nAfter narrowly finishing second last year in Denmark's Eurovision selection competition - the Danish Melodi Grand Prix - Nissen triumphed on Saturday in the city of Herning with her song 'Where I Am'. \nNissen, 21, brought up on her Danish parents' farm west of Sydney, won 'The Voice' on Australian TV in 2014 when she was coached by Black Eyed Peas star Will.i.am. \nThe Eurovision news site, ESCDAILY.com, says she was asked by SBS to go to Eurovision in 2015. But eventually SBS chose Guy Sebastian instead. \nIn May in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, Nissen will be vying against the yet-to-be-announced Australian entrant and others in the Eurovision contest. \nLast May in Stockholm, Australian singer Dami Im came second overall and won the jury vote with her song Sound of Silence, paving the way for Australia to be represented again this year. \nSebastian, Australia's first entrant in the contest, came fifth in Vienna in 2015 with his song Tonight Again.
