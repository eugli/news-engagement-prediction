The photo appears to depict a white male wearing blue jeans, a blue coat/jacket and a hoodie,\" a statement from the Indiana State Police read. \nInvestigators told ABC News that a search warrant was executed at a home in Delphi on Thursday night, but it did not yield anything of value to the investigation. \nThe statement referred to preliminary evidence that led the police's attention to the man in the picture, without providing details. \n\"During the course of the investigation, preliminary evidence has led investigators to believe the person in the distributed photo is suspected of having participated in the murders of Abigail Williams and Liberty German,\" the statement added. \nThe case has garnered great attention in the otherwise peaceful area of rural Indiana. \n\"The people of Delphi are being very helpful,\" the spokesman said. \"They are helping in any way that they can.\" \nThousands of people gathered in Delphi this weekend to take part in a memorial motorcycle ride for the two girls. Organizers estimated that more than 3,000 people took part in the ride on Saturday and hundreds of others watched, according to The Lafayette Journal and Courier, a local paper. \nThe paper said that the town's center overflowed with motorcycles and cars, with participants paying $20 per driver and $5 per passenger to ride from the Office Tavern Bar in Delphi to the Whiskey and Wine Saloon in nearby Monticello and that the funds were split between the victims' families. \nABC affiliate WRTV in Indianapolis reported that Delphi residents were applying purple ribbons to their homes and storefronts to show their support for the girls' families. \nThe affiliate also reported that several businesses in Delphi are hosting other fundraisers for the families.
