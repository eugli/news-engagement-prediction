It’s a third more than we’ve ever had,” she told Deadline . Texas attorney Rachel Lindsay, 31, has reportedly been selected as the first black “Bachelorette.” (Mitch Haaseth/ABC) \n“And because what is working so well in that fandom — which is rabid — it is so much the audience helping us choose the next person in the franchise. So the first step for me was trying to change the population to try to get to that place, and I feel this year we have a couple of potentially really good candidates. I’m feeling optimistic.” \nThe only non-white lead in the franchise was Venezuelan Juan Pablo Galavis, who was born in Ithaca, in 2013. \n‘Bachelor’ twins Emily and Haley Ferguson get their own show \nTessa Horst and Catherine Ciudici, who are both part Asian, are the only two people of color to ever win the show, in 2007 and 2013 respectively. \n“UnReal,” a Lifetime show that parodies the stereotypical happily-ever-after competition, featured a black suitor in the second season. \nB.J. Britt, who played Darius Hill, said the “Bachelor” franchise should have had a black suitor “years ago,” but that he hoped his fictional “UnReal” would influence reality. Lindsay is currently competing for Nick Viall’s affection on “The Bachelor.” (Mark Coffey/ABC) \n“That’s what ‘UnReal’ does, they’re kicking down doors; they’re not afraid to say what it is. And they can do it in a pop cultural context, which allows you to talk about it,” he told Vogue . \nWhy you should be watching ‘UnREAL\" \n“Of course, it’s scripted, so nobody’s in trouble. But it gets you thinking, and it allows you to have that conversation at the dinner table.” \nWhether or not “UnReal” had anything to do with ABC’s decision to cast Lindsay as the new Bachelorette, the lawyer will break a decades-long streak of white leads. \n“Bachelor” creator Mike Fleiss teased a “historic” announcement last week on Twitter. \nLindsay is still in the running on “The Bachelor,” but her announcement as the next Bachelorette almost certainly guarantees that Viall will give his heart to another.
