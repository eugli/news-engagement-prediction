VALENCIA, CA/USA - NOVEMBER 11, 2015 Reprints \nVerizon Communications ( VZ ) on Monday will bring back unlimited wireless data plans, just three days after Sprint ( S ) undercut T-Mobile US ( TMUS ) pricing for unlimited data family plans, as wireless industry competition intensifies. \nVerizon has been a holdout amid fierce wireless competition. Both T-Mobile US and Sprint gained share in the second half of 2016 with aggressive unlimited promotions. Verizon stopped selling unlimited plans in 2011. Verizon management has argued that T-Mobile and Sprint don't have the network capacity to sustain unlimited data offerings. \nAT&T[ ticker symb=T] sells unlimited data plans but only for subscribers that also buy its DirecTV video service. AT&T ended 2016 with nearly 8 million unlimited data subscribers. AT&T's success with bundled offers could pressure cable TV firms Comcast ( CMCSA ) and Charter Communications ( CHTR ) to push into wireless services, analysts say. \nVerizon says it will offer an \" introductory\" unlimited plan , also including voice calls and texting, that costs $80 monthly plus taxes and fees for single users. A family plan for four subscribers will cost $45 per line, or $180 monthly, plus fees. \nT-Mobile in January said it will only offer unlimited plans to postpaid wireless subscribers going forward. T-Mobile also launched \"Un-Carrier Next,\" a promotion offering unlimited data for one subscribers priced at $75 monthly, including taxes and fees. \nRonan Dunne, president of Verizon's wireless division, said in a release on Sunday: \"We also fundamentally want you to have more choice. We're not limiting you to a single plan. If you don't need unlimited data, we still have (tiered) plans that are perfect for you.\" Verizon brought in Dunne, a veteran of wireless wars in the United Kingdom, in 2016 as wireless growth slowed. \nHowever, Verizon will place conditions on its unlimited service. \"To ensure a quality experience for all customers, after 22 gigabytes of data usage on a line during any billing cycle we may prioritize usage behind other customers in the event of network congestion,\" the company said. \nSprint on Friday introduced a new family promotion, offering 5 lines of unlimited data for $90 per month excluding taxes and fees vs. T-Mobile's $180 plan for 5 lines and $160 plan for 4 including taxes and fees. Sprint's promotion lasts through March 31. \nVerizon shares rose 17 cents to 48.98 Friday, trying to recover from a sharp sell-off following the telecom giant's Q4 earnings report on Jan. 24. T-Mobile edged up 0.2%, near recent record highs. Sprint climbed 2.2% after finding support earlier in the week near its 500-day line. AT&T edged up 0.1%, tracking with its 50-day average in recent sessions. \nRELATED:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:56:11.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
