Repeat this while getting as far away as possible. Ad Feedback \n- Ring 111 immediately if you are concerned for your safety or think someone is following you. \nThis incident is the latest in a number of reported incidents of attempted child abduction near schools in west Auckland and on the North Shore. \nDuring the school holidays, a child was riding their bike on Princes St, Northcote Point, and was approached by two men in a white van with an orange and black strip. The child was asked whether they wanted to go with the men but the child's mother was just a few steps behind, according to Northcote Primary School's newsletter. Another incident was reported last week, but it turned out to be an innocuous offer of a ride to school. \nPolice say there was nothing sinister behind the incident, when a man driving a van approached an 11-year-old boy near Northcote Intermediate on Wednesday morning. \nSchool principal Ben Kelsey said the man was a well-known member of the community, whose own children previously attended the school. \nThe offer of a lift to the school was quite genuine, he said. - Rodney Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:22:29.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
