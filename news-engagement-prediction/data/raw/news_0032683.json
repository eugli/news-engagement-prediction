(ABC News: James Fettes) \nBut Mr Georgalis disagreed with the characterisation of an oversupply, saying the benefits of adding extra apartment stock was clear. \n\"There's been an underlying demand for apartments for the past couple of years in Canberra and a gross undersupply,\" he said. \n\"Vacancy rates for rental properties sit under half a per cent ... we're seeing that now being taken up and being realised by the market.\" \nGenerally, developers must pre-sell up to 70 per cent of an off-the-plan apartment block before starting construction. \n\"The demand isn't being met today but is certainly being met in two years,\" Mr Georgalis said. \nAs for the future of the market, he was bullish. \n\"We're certainly quite confident ... we have invested enormously, building up a pipeline of over 2,000 apartments,\" he said. \n\"We see that now being about two-and-a-half (or) three years' supply for our business.\" \nMr Phillips pointed to the cyclical nature of the market to predict future moderation. \n\"What goes up usually comes down, so I would expect sometime in the near future building levels would come down to more sustainable levels for the population changes that we've got.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:30:46.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
