Fish like pike, and burbot can also help to prevent hypertension and respiratory disease Fish like pike, and burbot can also help to prevent hypertension and respiratory disease. Another problem affecting obesity is that the nomadic routes have been shortened by traditional herders. The distance of pasture routes of nomadic herders with their reindeer have halved over the past 25 years, according to a report in The Siberian Times which revealed details of the obesity concerns. Russia is exploiting oil and gas reserves in the region, and herders stay closer to the energy company facilities to sell their meat to workers. So the herders are walking shorter distances on the reindeer pasture route and consequently burning fewer calories. The study took place in the Yamalo-Nenets autonomous region in the north of the Russian Federation Another problem affecting obesity is that the nomadic routes have been shortened by traditional herders, as they seek to stay close to Russian energy company's facilities to sell the reindeer meat Dr Titovsky said: 'Over the past few years the diet has changed considerably, and people living in the tundra started eating so-called chemically processed products.' 'It never happened before that the small local indigenous peoples of the north suffered from obesity.' 'It is a nonsensical modern problem. Now even a predisposition to obesity is being noticed.' Noodles, pasta, bread, pastry and sugar have become part of the tribes' diets, leading to a fifty per cent reduction in the consumption of traditional foods The herders often buy instant noodles in villages on their pasture routes and this has led to the decline in the consumption of more traditional food sources 'The volume of consumed carbohydrates increases significantly. They replace their traditional food with them,' he warned. 'Noodles and other fast foods are \"easy\" to eat and transport but the lack of traditional venison and fish in the diet is bad. 'The problem is that carbohydrates do not contain the necessary micro elements which help survival in Arctic conditions.' A diet of venison and fresh river fish actually have health benefits specific to the harsh climate of the Yamalo-Nenets region of Siberia Read more: Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T14:02:36.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
