2017, 09:01 Briton given £1m by UK government blows himself up for Islamic State Father of five was given compensation by the UK government for alleged torture while in detention \nA British Islamic State fighter who is believed to have carried out a suicide bombing in Iraq was a former Guantanamo Bay detainee, according to reports. \nThe bomber, named by the group as Abu Zakariya al-Britani, is said to have detonated an explosives-filled vehicle in a village to the south of Mosul. \nThe 50-year-old, also known as Jamal al Harith or Jamal Udeen, was suspected of terrorism by the Americans but freed from the US detention centre in 2004 after lobbying by the British government. \nHe reportedly alleged torture and received £1 million in compensation from the UK government after his release. \nAccording to the BBC, the bomber was a Muslim convert born Ronald Fiddler. \nZakariya al-Britani turned to Islam in the 1990s and travelled to the Pakistani city of Quetta in 2001 for what he claimed was a religious holiday. \nHe has insisted he tried to enter Iran when the US invaded neighbouring Afghanistan, but was captured and imprisoned by the Taliban on suspicion of being a UK spy. \nAround 850 individuals of national security concern have travelled to join the conflict, according to figures published by the Government last year. \nOf those, just under half have returned to the UK and approximately 15% are dead. \nThe terrorist's brother, Leon Jameson, 53, identified him as the man equipped with explosives in the IS propaganda video. \nMr Jameson told The Times his brother had \"wasted his life\" and added: \"It is him, I can tell by his smile.\" \nFormer prime minister Tony Blair came under fire for the reported lobbying by his government for the Guantanamo Bay prisoner's release. \nThe Daily Mail quoted Tory MP Tim Loughton as saying: \"So much for Tony Blair's assurances that this extremist did not pose a security threat. \n\"He clearly was a risk to Britain and our security all along. \n\"It adds insult to injury that he was given £1 million in compensation because of Blair's flawed judgment that he was an innocent.\" « UK: Door will not be
