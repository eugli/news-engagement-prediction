Participants were asked how long they slept each night, with seven to nine hours considered optimum and less than six hours insufficient. \nAmong 2,908 women aged 45 years and younger, a clear link was found between poor sleep and having children. \nEach child in a household increased the chances of not getting enough sleep by 50%. \nOverall, 48% of women under 45 with children reported getting at least seven hours of sleep compared with 62% of those without children. \nNo other factors, including exercise, marital status and education, appeared to influence how long younger women slept.
