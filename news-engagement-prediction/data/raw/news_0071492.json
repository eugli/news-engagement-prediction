She was put into a van and forced into a plane bound for her home country. She did not have access to her lawyers or have the chance to pack any clothes. Advertisement \nIrene Clennel has 2 sons and a granddaughter with her husband, all 3 of whom are British citizens. \nThe British Home Office refused to comment on the case. \nAlthough Mrs Clennel was given indefinite leave to remain the UK after her marriage, she had returned to Singapore on several occasions to care for her aging and frail parents. However, the Home Office saw this as a chance to invalidate her residential status and denied her repeated attempts to seek permission to live with her husband again, who is also in poor health. \nThis despite Mrs Clennel being her husband's primary caregiver. \nThe Home Office spokesperson told reporters, \"All applications for leave to remain in the UK are considered on their individual merits and in line with the immigration rules. We expect those with no legal right to remain in the country to leave.\" \nUK-based charity Migrant Voice is hosting a campaign to bring Irene Clennel back to Britain.
