It was five and a half hours of surgery – I was awake, just sedated. I'm shaking!\n\"I had butterflies hoping Coleen would like it, as I know her views on plastic surgery.\nLinda Nolan revealed the results of her facelift on Loose Women She looked incredible \"I was advised by my doctor [to be awake for the surgery]. They put the sedation in and I was like, 'I can feel everything', but then I don't remember anything else. I must have been trying to say 'my nose itches' as the surgeon asked someone to scratch it.\"\nColeen was shocked, and said: \"Wow, you look fabulous! You look absolutely fabulous!\"\nShe's previously spoken out how she didn't want to look like anyone else – just herself, \"but ten years younger\".\n\"Wow, look at you!\" the panellists exclaimed. \"You look absolutely fabulous.\"\nThis was before and after \"I'm definitely the younger sister now,\" Linda joked as she put her face next to Coleen's.\n\"My ears were really sore as that's where they put the extra skin, that's where the scars are. But I'm thrilled about my neck, and my jowls have gone now.\n\"People were coming up to me in the supermarket and were whispering in my ear, 'It looks fabulous'.\n\"I'm feeling more confident. I went to two auditions and got both the jobs.\"\nShe's now so much more confident This is what Linda looked like before (Photo: ITV) Coleen was blindfolded before seeing her sister (Photo: ITV) She was shocked at the results (Photo: ITV) Earlier in the show, Linda showed the immediate results of the procedure - which she was awake for.\nLooking very swollen, she said: \"I didn't feel a thing. I've been looked after amazingly.\n\"Obviously there's swelling, but I'm fine and can't wait to show the finished results.\"\nA shocked Coleen - who said her sister looked like a Teletubby - said: \"I don't like seeing her like that. It's horrible seeing her like that.\"\nRead More They clearly enjoyed the afterparty!

It’s exactly what I wanted,” smiles Linda, who chose a lower facelift and extreme skin peel on the advice of her surgeon.\n“It’s amazing to wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and feel better about yourself. And when I meet people I haven’t seen for a while, they’re amazed. In fact their reaction has been the best thing about this.\nRead More Bianca Gascoigne brands ex-boyfriend CJ Meeks \"pathetic\" after VERY public split Linda chose a lower facelift and extreme skin peel on the advice of her surgeon (Photo: Urban PR) Linda Nolan lost husband Brin at 60 to skin cancer in 2007 (Photo: Nicky Johnston) “I looked so tired before. I would look in the mirror and see everything I’d gone through in the past 10 years on my face. The facelift has enhanced my life. The sadness has gone.”\nLinda has suffered enough tragedy. She lost husband Brian at 60 to skin cancer in 2007 and 52-year-old Bernie to breast cancer in 2013, having battled it herself in 2006.\nAt her lowest, she contemplated suicide. And her sadness only deepened every time it was reflected in the mirror.\nBut now, four weeks after surgery at London’s Harley Street Skin Clinic, all she can see is positivity shining back. Linda was awake through her op, having a local rather than general anaesthetic for the lower facelift.\nRead More Newly-single CJ Meeks shows no sign of heartbreak as he parties with two mystery women after Bianca Gascoigne split Linda shines in JD Williams Cherry Wrap Front Jersey Top £20, JD Williams Black bootcut Jeans £40, Phase Eight Sophia rose god necklace £29, New Look Heels £22.99 (Photo: Nicky Johnston) “I was given a relaxant that made me feel great. I recall the surgeon saying, ‘she says her nose is itchy, can someone scratch it?’ But I don’t remember much at all. I felt no pain.”\nShe jokes that the facelift and chemical skin peel left her looking like an “orange Malteser” at first.\n“But in a few days the swelling had gone. I noticed the changes in my top lip – I no longer had very deep lines from smoking – and my jawline, because my jowls had gone,” she says.\n“Day by day my skin felt better. And, the sadness in my face had gone.” The star has spent two weeks recuperating at sister Denise’s home in Blackpool. She wore support bandages around her face the first five days. “It was like wearing a balaclava,” she jokes. “But I was so pampered. Denise cooked for me and people popped in. It didn’t take long for my face to recover and I’ve had an amazing response already. Two friends came round and when I opened the door they both screamed.\nRead More Jedward still have not spoken to their dad after discovering he was 'fighting for his life in hospital' Linda says she has had an amazing response from her friends and family following her surgery (Photo: Harley Street Skin Clinic) Linda reckons she could now challenge younger sister Coleen for youthful looks (Photo: Harley Street Skin Clinic) “They were shocked at how well I looked. And my great niece Sienna, Maureen’s granddaughter, said: ‘You look beautiful Auntie Linda’. That works for me.”\nOne person who had’t seen Linda’s facelift before today was Coleen, who won Celebrity Big Brother .\n“I screamed the house down as Coleen won,” Linda said in a previous interview with the Sunday Mirror. “She would never in a million years have believed she could have won. She looked so shocked.” But Linda laughed that Coleen was about to have a bigger surprise when she saw her sister’s face.\nLinda revealed: “I spoke to her ­afterwards and she asked me what I’d been up to. I felt so guilty because I didn’t say I was speaking to her with a new face!\n“I know she’ll go mad as she’s so anti-surgery. But she’ll only find out when she sees this paper!”\nLinda reckons she could now ­challenge Coleen for youthful looks. She laughs: “I think I look younger than her now so maybe she’ll be asking for the clinic’s number! I looked years older than my age with all the grief. I was aged well beyond my years. People say I know look 20 years younger after my facelift.\n“But Coleen will kill me for it!”\nRead More Nicola McLean reignites Danielle Lloyd row: 'I DID go to her wedding, she talks a load of f**king tripe!' Linda thinks her surgery could also boost her love life as she regains her confidence (Photo: Harley Street Skin Clinic) Just before Christmas Linda had her first kiss after losing Brian 10 years ago (Photo: Harley Street Skin Clinic) And Linda is hoping her facelift may also lift her love life. Just before Christmas she had her first smooch after losing Brian with an old friend who lives overseas. She says it’s given her ­confidence of finding companionship.\n“He texted me and said: ‘We’ll have to try the new lips when I come back over’,” she says.\n“He was the right person at the right time. He helped me get over that first hurdle of having a kiss. I’m still scared to death of dating but Brian told me he didn’t want me to be on my own.”\nLinda still carries a mini urn of her manager husband’s ashes everywhere. “That sadness will always be inside me but I’m dealing with it now,” she says. “I miss Brian and Bernie but that desperate feeling of loneliness is gone.\n“It’s as if something has clicked inside of me. Brian was fabulous for supporting me. He’d be looking at my new face now going, ‘You’re not bad for an old bird’.” But her search for companionship which she says will “not necessarily be a sexual thing” will have to compete with work. She starts a major UK tour with musical Our House in the summer.\nLinda admits: “It’s a shame, but looks do matter in showbiz. So the facelift has give me a real a boost to my confidence at work.” But that’s it as far as surgery goes. “It was a big decision to get this done and I’m delighted with it,” she says.\n“For the next 20 years I’ll always look a bit younger than I am. I’ll be nearly 80 by then and I think when you’re 80 you’re entitled to look the way you want to look.”\nLinda had her treatment at http://harleystreetskinclinic.com *Loose Women continues on ITV1 weekdays at 12.30pm\n Celebs Newsletter Follow @MirrorTV Subscribe to our Celebs Comments Show more comments More On Cosmetic surgery Plastic surgery Reality shows Linda Nolan Loose Women Coleen Nolan", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorTV", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3823/4221396001_5326928594001_5326919729001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/dailymirrortv", "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://harleystreetskinclinic.com/"], "published": "2017-02-17T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:12:59.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
