Talking to a number of banks when it was growing more quickly, they didn't want to pull back because their competitors weren't pulling back.\" RBA eyes household debt, borrowing \nAdding to comments he made earlier this week, Dr Lowe highlighted the difficult position in which the Reserve Bank now finds itself ; cutting rates could further fuel real estate prices while raising rates could threaten highly indebted households. \n\"Is it really in the national interest to create vulnerabilities in household finances?\" he asked the committee. \nHe noted that it would be better if unemployment was \"a bit lower, and inflation a bit higher\". \nBut he argued easing rates to lift growth would only push up borrowing and house prices.

(AAP: Alan Porritt, file photo) \nWhen asked if the central bank was concerned over the levels of household debt, Dr Lowe replied: \"It's a risk factor. It's just one of the risk factors that plays into our decision making.\" \nDebt is still rising faster than income, spurred on by record low interest rates and low borrowing costs. Australian household debt to income reached a level of 177 per cent in 2016, according to Prime Capital. Competitive tax system \nWhile the RBA governor highlighted the importance of having an internationally competitive tax system, he questioned the wisdom of the global race to cut corporate taxes. \nThere is a form of international tax competition going on, and in the post crisis environment, lowering corporate tax rate as a potential strategic advantage to attract investment elsewhere around the world, he said. \n\"I think you could argue that, this is from a global perspective it's not actually that useful,\" Dr Lowe said. \n\"Because just lowering the corporate tax rate from one country to another just changes the location of investment, it doesn't increase aggregate investment.\" \nDr Lowe said Parliament would have to make a choice between responding to international tax competition, or say no, confident that the country has other advantages that attracts investment. \nThe Reserve Bank expects the Australian economy to grow by around 3 per cent in 2017 and 2018, with LNG production expected to add 0.5 per cent to GDP growth. \nHeadline inflation is expected to be back above 2 per cent later in 2017, boosted by higher prices for petrol and tobacco.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:49:20.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
