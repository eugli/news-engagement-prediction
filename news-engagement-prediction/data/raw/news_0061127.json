I couldn't. I literally am incapable of being in the real world and surviving.'\nAnd whilst the 46-year-old year singer 'used to get upset by these things,' she insists this was 'out of her control' but still puts some blame on herself.\nAs told to Rolling Stone: Attempting to explain how her in-ears weren't working, she said: 'I don't even want to bring this up too much, but whatever, we're obviously talking about it, the New Year's Eve situation - that couldn't be helped'\nShe added to Rolling Stone magazine: 'I used to get upset by things. This was out of my control, and had everything not been such a total chaotic mess, then I would have been able to make something happen.\n'Even the dancers should have stopped dancing and helped me off the f***ing stage. I'm sorry. It was a mess, and I blame everybody, and I blame myself for not leaving after rehearsal.'\nMeanwhile, Mariah previously admitted that she was left 'humiliated' after her New Year's Eve performance.\n'I used to get upset by things': She went on that 'It's just something where if I can't explain it to the entire world, then they're not going to understand it, because it's not what they do'\nShe said: 'I haven't really addressed the situation that happened on New Year's Eve, and in time I will. But for now, I want everyone to know that I came to New Year's Eve in New York in great spirits and was looking forward to a celebratory moment with the world.\n'It's a shame that we were put into the hands of a production team with technical issues who chose to capitalize on circumstances beyond our control.\n'It's not practical for a singer to sing live and be able to hear themselves properly in the middle of Times Square with all the noise, the freezing cold, the smoke from the smoke machines, and thousands of people celebrating, especially when their ear monitors are not working properly.\n'Listen guys, they foiled me, thus it turned into an opportunity to humiliate me and all those who were excited to ring in the New Year with me. Eventually, I will explain this in greater detail than I can give here.'\n'I blame everybody, and I blame myself': She went on to say that 'Even the dancers should have stopped dancing and helped me off the f***ing stage'", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjz34bQq6LSAhUG5CYKHfIxBJIQFggvMAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rollingstone.com%2Fmusic%2Ffeatures%2Fmariah-carey-on-chaotic-new-years-performance-w467631&usg=AFQjCNHnfiY0HR1YNfRsxhnFOJBGbpF5yQ&sig2=VGHAlE8HJaLDcpJTuTAxuQ&bvm=bv.147448319,d.eWE", "https://twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/818112397156171777", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-22T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:33:30.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
