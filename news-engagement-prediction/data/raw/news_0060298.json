Kang should be more grateful and polite as a diplomatic person, in order for people to respect North Korea, especially since Malaysia is supposed to be a friendly nation. \nAnnoying \nWhat I particularly find annoying is when Kang started lecturing his host country for abusing human rights, when North Korea is known for its poor human rights record. \nIn the first place, how did Kang know that the police had pointed a gun at the family members of the North Korean suspect? It was all hearsay. \nIf the family had been threatened, they should lodge a police report. Kang should show us the police report before he tried to divert attention from the assassination or ridicule the police by suggesting that if the two ladies are still alive, then no poison was being used by them in the prank. \nKang had never explained why two ladies (one from Vietnam and the other from Indonesia) had wanted to play a prank on Kang. Did they even know each other? Who was really the mastermind (or the go-between) the ladies of two different nationalities? \nBesides, if a poison was being used, there are some that would not kill a person unless it is inhaled or ingested. Why did Kang not know this at all? It is common sense. \nKang’s arguments all this while have not been cohesive either. It is obvious to me that when someone is trying to deflect the blame on others, there must be some degree of truth in what has been said about the assassination, especially when other family members had also been assassinated. \nWhen the then-president of the United States, George W Bush, used the term ‘axis of evil’ to describe North Korea on Jan 29, 2002, he was referring to the country as being among a few countries that are accused of sponsoring terrorism or seeking weapons of mass destruction. \nIf this had tarnished North Korean’s reputation, what Kang had done drives home the point further that North Korea is unable to live peaceably with or respect other nations. \nCurrently, if four North Korean suspects had fled to Pyongyang, the North Korean police should immediately look for these four suspects, arrest and hand them over to the Malaysian police for further investigation. Has Kang Chol even offered such cooperation from his side? \nFor the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
