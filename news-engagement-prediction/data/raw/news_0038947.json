Thankfully, a new Scandinavian term has come to our attention, and trust us—you already do it. \nYou can thank Finland for putting a name to a routine we've all engaged in at some point. The word is kalsarikannit , and it roughly translates to \"drinking home alone in your underwear with no intention of going out for the evening.\" The Finnish not only have a word for this habit (which makes me love them all the more), but it's such a way of life that they created an emoji for it: How you kalsarikannit. (Image credit: ThisisFINLAND ) \nLook how happy these emoji people are! Kalsarikannit isn't something to be ashamed of, like there was nothing better going on, so you're home alone against your will. Oh no, it's a plan you chose—because sometimes you just need to spend some time with yourself in your skivvies and sip a nice Cabernet. Sounds like self care to me. \nOther country-specific emojis from Finland include: baby in a box (something nearly all Finnish babies experience ), kokko (the feeling of being on fire), sisu (the feeling of perseverance), headbanger (there are more heavy metal bands per capita in Finland than anywhere else), and of course, sauna . There's even one for Tom of Finland (and it's totally SFW). Browse all 54 if you're so inclined. \nThere's a very special type of satisfaction that comes from finding a word that describes a highly specific habit or emotion—like someone, somewhere really understands your true self. Science of Us rounds up ten such words, including amae, Japanese for \"leaning on someone's goodwill\" in a supremely trusting way (aww), which can be alternately translated as, \"behaving like a spoiled child\" (oof). There's also awumbuk, which those in Papua New Guinea use to describe \"the feeling of emptiness after visitors depart.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:08:01.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
