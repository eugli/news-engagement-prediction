He complained the press don't tell the truth President Donald Trump (Photo: Getty) \nTrump started his press conference on the offensive. \nHe said he was there to \"update the American people on the incredible progress\" his administration had made in his first month in office. \nBut he complained that \"many of our nation's reporters will not tell you the truth.\" \nLater in the 75 minute press conference, he had a to and fro with CNN reporter Jim Acosta - where he not only dismissed the broadcaster as \"fake news\" but \"very fake news.\" \nAnd even the BBC took a beating, with John Sopel being dismissed as \"another beauty\". He said the Beeb were \"just like CNN.\" 2. ....and then he lied about his election victory \nHe'd barely had time to take a breath after attacking the media for not telling the truth, before he told his first blatant lie. \nHe said his 306 electoral vote victory was “I guess the biggest electoral win since Ronald Reagan.” \nThis is untrue Every president since Ronald Reagan, with the exception of George W Bush, won their elections by a greater margin than Donald Trump. \nConfronted with this falsehood, Trump at first said he had been talking about Republicans. But when he was told of George HW Bush’s 426 vote win, he said: “I was just given that information, I was just - given it, we had a very big margin.” \nWhat is the electoral college and how does it work? US Presidential election voting system explained \nThe reporter asked: “I guess the question is, why should Americans trust you when you accuse the information they receive as being fake when you’re providing information that is not accurate?” \nTrump said: “Well, I was given that information. I was, actually I’ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that?” \nThe exasperated reporter simply replied: “You’re the President.” 3. He claimed drugs are as cheap as candy bars (Photo: REUTERS) \nTrump claimed America was \"becoming a drug infested nation.\" \nHe added: \"Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars\". \nHe did not provide any evidence for this claim. 4. He claimed to be the \"least anti-Semitic person you've ever seen\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:06:30.718+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
