An alligator in South Carolina is leading the way.\nThe 4- to 5-foot (1.2-1.5 meter) gator has been spotted in and out of a pond in Hanahan, near Charleston. Charleston's Post and Courier newspaper spoke to Kent A. Vliet , an alligator biologist at the University of Florida, and learned the color is probably temporary, and due to something in the gator's environment.\nMore animal antics Rare video captures brown snake swallowing python whole Snail defends itself by whacking predators with its shell Panda vs. snowman is the winter smackdown we all need to see \"I have no doubt that animal is stained somehow,\" Vliet told the paper. \"He's the color of rust.\"\nSince the condition isn't genetic, Vliet said the color will eventually wash off or fade away. And gators shed their skin, so like a real orange, it'll eventually get peeled. \nBecause the neighborhood where the orange gator hangs out is called Tanner Plantation, people posting on the area's Facebook page have had fun with the joke that the color comes from too much self-tanning lotion. Which also led to more than one resident naming the critter after President Donald Trump, who also seems to enjoy self-tanning products. \n\"It's the Trumpagator of Self-Tanner Plantation,\" wrote one Facebook user quoted by the Post and Courier .\n24 The 24 deadliest animals on Earth, ranked Solving for XX : The industry seeks to overcome outdated ideas about \"women in tech.\" \nCrowd Control : A crowdsourced science fiction novel written by CNET readers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:00:45.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
