But she said that she would still perform for the president again. \"The reason why I did sing for the inauguration was not politics,\" Jackie Evancho, 16, said Thursday on \" Good Morning America \" in an interview alongside her sister, Juliet Evancho. \"It was for the honor and privilege to perform for my country and that will stay the same I think.\" \n\nSinger Jackie Evancho 'disappointed' in Trump move on transgender protections \n\nAs Jackie Evancho prepares for Inauguration performance, her transgender sister Juliet Prepares for gender confirmation surgery \nBut they nonetheless expressed concern over the president's new transgender policy.
