They were taken to a nearby location. \nJCC Director Karen Kolodney said she does not believe it’s a credible threat and plans to reopen the center once she receives the all clear. \nSeveral other centers across the country were also evacuated Monday including in Cherry Hill, New Jersey; Davy, Florida; and two in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The calls came within a couple hours of each other, Bauman reported. \n“This is the new normal, I’m hoping that it isn’t and I’m hoping that we can change the society in which we live and people don’t have to live in this kind of fear,” Kolodney said.
