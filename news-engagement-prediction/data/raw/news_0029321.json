The included compact charging case quickly charges the buds. The Bad Their open design allows for a lot of ambient noise to leak in. There are no controls on the buds (except Siri). Similarly priced wireless models deliver better sound. And yes, they look pretty dorky. The Bottom Line Look past their offbeat design and you'll find that Apple AirPods' compact size and high convenience factor are a winning combination. 7.9 Overall", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:58:07.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
