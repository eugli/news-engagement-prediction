Tinubu will also want to contest, Dogara, Tambuwal, Atiku... they will miss it.\" Asked what he thinks about the rumoured death of the president, the INRI spiritual head, confirmed that he is still alive but stated however, that \"his coming back needs a lot of prayers. He needs a lot of prayers to be able to come back to that seat otherwise, it might not work as we are looking at it. Only God will bring Buhari back.\" He added also that the president has to deal with certain bothering issues in the country. \"I want to tell you that the economic hardship will continue. Dasuki issue will continue, Avengers's request must be met. CBN governor should be removed, then we can have stability in the economy. \"There will be more protests, Osinbajo will betrayed by those he trusts the most. America is in trouble presently, the world is also in trouble. \"The United Nations and the American government will be in trouble. America, Lagos, and Nigeria will break unless the right things are done. \"Biafra is not a joke, it should be handled carefully. The people defecting to the APC will be disgraced from there. Some will leave APC and let us pray because not all governors will finish their terms,\" the revered Nigerian preacher offered.
