Oakley was removed from his courtside seat midway through the first quarter after being surrounded by guards. Oakley, who was sitting near the Knicks’ owner, James L.

Oakley” as he was being led off. Oakley continued to fume as he stood in the tunnel outside the court. With his hands in cuffs and guards surrounding him, Oakley yelled in anger. “I didn’t do nothing,” he said, mixing in expletives. He said Dolan was responsible — although he did not say for what.
