(Photo: Danielle Levitt) \nComedy Central's \"Detroiters\" uses shots of local landmarks during the opening credits to establish a sense of place. You'll see the Spirit of Detroit statue, the Ambassador Bridge, the People Mover and so on. \nIt's all familiar and pretty predictable. But keep watching the first episode a few more minutes. Wait for it. Hey, there's Sam Richardson from HBO's \"Veep,\" playing a character who's stress-vomiting in front of the real-life Detroit Club on Cass Avenue (called the Chop House here) after a business meeting. \nAnd, look, Richardson and \"Saturday Night Live\" alum Tim Robinson, as two small-time ad agency partners, are brainstorming potential Chrysler slogans like wild men: \"You'll love the visor in your brand-new Chrysler!\"...\"If I don't get a Chrysler, I'm gonna cry, sir!\"... Jesus Chryster, what a car!!!\" \nAnd, yes, that's the Temple Bar, where the two pals are watching the debut of their local TV ad for a hot-tub store. After it airs, an unidentified news anchor — played by legendary former Detroit anchorman Mort Crim — weighs in by saying, \"Wow, normally, I don't comment on the commercials, but that was very bad.\" \nIt finally happened, folks. Unlike past sitcoms set in Detroit (ABC's \"Home Improvement,\" Fox's \"Martin,\" and NBC's \"Undateable) and some crime dramas (ABC's \"Detroit 1-8-7,\" AMC's \"Low Winter Sun\") and a quirky dramedy about a male gigolo (HBO's \"Hung\") that actually filmed here, a TV series has arrived that weaves the Motor City into its visual and scripted content in ways that only someone who knows and loves the city can appreciate fully. \nTo be sure, \"Detroiters\" — which premieres at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday on Comedy Central — is not a socio-economic/cultural statement on daily life in Detroit any more than the 1987 sci-fi classic \"RoboCop\" was a realistic portrayal of Motor City crime-fighting. Yet there's something very authentic, if also hilariously goofy, about it. \nAs best friends Sam Duvet and Tim Cramblin, Richardson, who's 33, and the 35-year-old Robinson play millennials in Detroit who work together and live next door to each other. (To further entwine their lives, Tim is married to Sam's sister, who works on an automotive assembly line.) Their dream is to boost their struggling advertising business by winning the Chrysler account, which leads to some pretty aggressive, sometimes dangerous courting of a Chrysler executive played by Jason Sudeikis in the pilot. \nFrom left: Tim Robinson and Sam Richardson of Comedy Central's 'Detroiters.' (Photo: Comedy Central) \nIt's essentially two young, quirky men living an ordinary life, which by itself is fairly extraordinary for a Detroit-centric TV series. \"The fact (is) that it's not all urban decay and blight,\" says Richardson of the stereotypes Detroit is up against. \"There are people there who live, work and have lives. Not everybody who lives in Detroit is a gangsta. Not everybody who lives in Detroit is trying to steal from everybody (else) who lives in Detroit. There are cars that run, there are houses that are owned, you know?\" \nExecutive-produced by Sudeikis and Lorne Michaels and created by Richardson and Robinson, \"Detroiters\" aims to reach a broad audience with its genial, occasionally raunchy take on a buddy comedy. But the content has special meaning — and bonus laughs — for people who live here now or at least did at one time. \nThe show is laced with local references large and small, from its affectionate parodies of classic TV ads (get ready for the second episode's\"Hunky Specs,\" a take-off on the vintage \"Sexy Specs\" ad with Richard Golden) to the Michigan-shaped wooden cutting board in Tim's kitchen (how many have you bought as holiday gifts?).

Both are graduates of the local improv community who remained close friends after they moved away for career reasons. The actors recently spoke by phone to the Free Press in separate interviews about the series and how their real-life bond shaped it. \nRobinson calls the show's characters \"a heightened version of us,\" noting similar characteristics like his own sometimes quick temper. Richardson agrees that they're almost identical to their small-screen selves. \"What we always say is Tim and Sam are the real Tim and Sam if we were twice as dumb and half as lucky.\" \nThe two comedic talents met more than a dozen years ago through Second City Detroit and became close friends while working there and at Planet Ant in Hamtramck. Although they joined separate touring companies of Second City, they eventually wound up together on the troupe's famous main stage in Chicago, which has produced stars like Bill Murray, Steve Carell and Tina Fey. \n\"They worked closely together at both entities because they came in at the same time and there definitely was a rapport in their comedy,\" says Margaret Edwartowski, cofounder of the Planet Ant Home Team improve troupe. \"Like anyone who's launched out of this Detroit scene, they have this shared experience and a loyalty from being from Detroit that continues as they entered the broader world. They don't go out there and cut each other's throats. They try to give others a leg up whenever possible.\" \nRichardson moved to Los Angeles where he got experience in TV and film. After guesting on \"Veep\" as Selina Meyer's optimistic, inept aide Richard Splett, he was promoted to a costarring role in 2015. Robinson, who left Chicago for New York, became a featured player and writer for \"Saturday Night Live.\" \nIt was Sudeikis, an \"SNL\" alum and star of films like \"Horrible Bosses\" and \"We're the Millers,\" who prodded them to collaborate on a series. \"It was Jason's idea. He said, ‘Why don't the two of you do a show together?' \" recalled Robinson in early 2015, back when the \"Detroiters\" pilot was first announced. \nThey took him up on the suggestion. Together with “Saturday Night Live” alumni Zach Kanin and Joe Kelly, they created the series and, after getting Comedy Central's approval, did a five-day shoot in June 2015 for the pilot in and around Detroit. The project was approved for more than $445,000 in Michigan film incentives on anticipated spending of more than $1 million. \n(Continue reading below) Buy Photo \nThe cast of the Comedy Central pilot, \"The Detroiters\" (from the left) Joe Kelly, Sam Richardson, Tim Robinson, Executive Producer Jason Sudeikis, and Zach Kanin stand in front of the historic Detroit Club in downtown Detroit, where they film a scene on Friday, June 12, 2015.

Mitchell/Detroit Free Press) \nAbout a month after filming wrapped, however, the State of Michigan ended its incentives program. putting the brakes on the flood of movie and TV projects that had been flocking to the region. The news hit Richardson and Robinson hard. \n\"At first, when they took away the incentive, Sam and I were devastated,\" recalls Robinson. \"We were like, 'Oh, we have to scrap the show.' We didn't want to do it. It just meant so much to us to shoot it back home. I think that's the only way we would have done it.\" \nFortunately, Comedy Central agreed. \"Detroiters\" was given an OK by the network for a 10-episode season and came back to the Motor City in 2016 for the filming (and got help navigating the process from the Michigan Film & Digital Media Office and the City of Detroit). Local hires accounted for an estimated 97% of the crew and 79% of the cast. Seven young people landed internships with the series through Grow Detroit's Young Talent, the city's summer jobs program. \nAnd some 1,200 people got to be extras. Well, you need some crowd scenes when you're re-creating things like the Woodward Dream Cruise. \nRichardson and Robinson were committed to making Detroit virtually a third character of the series. Like others who grew up here, they were frustrated by the litany of feature films and documentaries that depicted the city as little more than an urban wasteland. \nFrom left: Sam Richardson and Tim Robinson of Comedy Central's 'Detroiters.' (Photo: Comedy Central) \n\"If you want to land a punchline for how bad something is, you say Detroit, even, like, in conversation. 'Oh, well, things could be worse. You could be in Detroit.' It makes me so mad,\" says Richardson. To demonstrate how bleak the stereotype can get, he launches into mock narration for a documentary: \" Remember the '60s when it was Motown?... Now it's nothing. It's awful.\" But quite seriously, he says, \"I think Detroit deserves a comedy that's not about suffering.\" \nLocal cast and crew members say Richardson and Robinson created an atmosphere on the set that spoke to their goal. \"Their personalities and how much they care about each other and how much they love Detroit, that's everything,\" says \"Detroiters\" location manager George Constas. \"It created the tone for everybody.\" \nDetroit native Shawntay Dalon, who plays Robinson's wife, says she loved the script. She describes acting with him and Richardson as facing off against improv kings. \"The script that you have is going to be just a blueprint, because they're going to go around and about, they're going to add and take away while the camera is on you. It was such an awesome experience working with them.\" \n\"Detroiters\" can be raucous at times, but it's grounded in the realities of two average, decent guys, one black and one white, whose ambitions are sometimes higher than their skill sets. The New York Times compared it to \"Dumb and Dumber\" meets \"Mad Men\" and that sounds about right. \nIn their quest for accurate touches, Richardson and Robinson had their characters consume favorite Detroit snacks. Richardson recounts drinking rivers of Faygo (\"We want to reclaim Faygo from the Juggalos,\" he jokes) and going through bags of Better Made potato chips for a particularly gut-busting sequence in the first episode that puts the Sudeikis character in harm's way. \nThey chose an onscreen hangout, Temple Bar in Midtown, that was convenient to their base camp at Masonic Temple and reflects the unpretentious vibe of the gathering place of their Detroit improv days, the 7 Brothers bar in Hamtramck. They gave Richardson's character the task of trying to renovate the house he's bought, mirroring the attempt by many to restore the city's decaying homes to their former glory. \nEven the Chrysler presence seems very personal. Robinson's wife is an electrical engineer for Fiat Chrysler based in California. His mother worked for several years at the UAW-DaimlerChrysler Technology Training Center. His grandfather was a plant manager at Chrysler's Detroit Forge plant. \nRichardson and Robinson sought advice from other Detroit comedy pros like Chris Powell, a.k.a. actor and stand-up performer Comedian CP, who was part of the writing staff and has a recurring role as a security guard. \"He's one of the funniest people on the planet,\" says Robinson. \nThey also turned to famous friends and mentors from Detroit, like Emmy-winning star Keegan-Michael Key, who appears in the first season as a furniture store owner. (Other guest stars include Michael Che and Cecily Strong of \"Saturday Night Live,\" \"Tonight Show\" announcer and \"SNL\" producer Steve Higgins, Richard Karn of \"Home Improvement,\" Detroit-based rapper Trick-Trick and \"Cosby Show\" veteran Malcolm-Jamal Warner.) \nFilming with Key was particularly resonant, according to Robinson. \"When we think about where we were when we all first met at the corner of Woodward and Montcalm at the old Second City (site in Detroit) and (were) doing shows for 20 people on a Tuesday night downtown, to then (be) shooting back in the place where we all started, it's very surreal for us. It felt good. It felt nice.\" \nFrom left: Tom Robinson and Sam Richardson of Comedy Central's 'Detroiters.' (Photo: Comedy Central) \nAnother connection that stretches back even further? Robinson's high school pal Rick Williams, owner of sneaker boutique Burn Rubber in Royal Oak, served as a show consultant and wrote the theme song. \nThe casting of a retired Detroit newsman like Crim is a particular dream of Robinson's come true. \"Tim loves the newscasters of today and then,\" says Richardson. \"They're like sports stars to him. Tim essentially he has baseball cards of these guys.\" \nSays Robinson, \"Growing up, I would just sit in my room and watch Detroit news. I was obsessed with Rich Fisher and Amyre Makupson and, of course, Bill Bonds. He was such a character. I just really liked these people. I'm just really a nerd for it.\" \nAnd those parody TV ads supposedly made by Tim and Sam's Cramblin Advertising? They are inspired by Robinson and Richardson's appreciation for Detroit commercials they watched as kids. \n\"Detroiters\" is a tribute to the often corny, sometimes absurd TV spots that stick in their memories, according to Richardson. \"We were never trying to be mean-spirited. The commercials live as homages to the commercials that we've seen.\" If the show gets renewed, he hopes to parody even more of them, like the old Farmer Jack jingle (\"It's just a matter of fact!\") that he once assumed was another hit song on the radio. \nThe new sitcom also has a gentler side that is a tribute to ​Richardson and Robinson's friendship, and they're not embarrassed to admit it. \"That's 100% reflective of our relationship. Sam and I aren't very macho guys, so there's not a lot of, like ... being afraid to say, 'I love you, buddy,' or being there for each other when we need each other,\" says Robinson. \n\"In our real life, there are a lot of sweet moments, and we support each other all the time. We definitely wanted these characters to feel the same way about each other.\" \nThey hope local viewers, especially, feel it, too, and support their passion project. Whatever the ratings turn out to be, a local seal of approval would mean the world to them. \n\"I hope it's received well by Detroiters, first and foremost,\" says Richardson. \nContact Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or jhinds@freepress.com.
