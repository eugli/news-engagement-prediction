External Link: An example of gameplay on Roblox. \nBut Ms McLean said concerns about Roblox highlighted a broader issue. \n\"Any app or platform or game that allows two-way interaction between your child and another player is going to have predators on it,\" she said. \n\"And then the risk ramps up when you can have chat. That's one of the features of this game. \n\"I think this is a very important warning for parents to not [just] look at the app or game developer's website. They will only tell you sunshine and happiness.\" Advice for parents concerned about gaming \nMs McLean said parents should maintain an \"open conversation\" with their children about what games they were playing and downloading. \n\"Primary school children in particular should not be downloading games themselves. Full stop. It should all be done by the parent. \n\"The rule should be the child asks the parent, the parent checks [the game] out, downloads it, then locks the device again. That gives the parents some control. \n\"The notion of 'I don't do games, it's all too hard' â€” that's not effective parenting in the 21st century.\" \nMs McLean added that parents should be researching games online and checking in with parenting information on the website of Australia's Children's eSafety Commissioner. \nThe commissioner's website has a listing on Roblox , including information about its two chat modes for children, however has no particular advice warning against the game. \nIn a statement to the ABC, Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said there were \"potential dangers for any child using apps or social media services with chat functionalities\". \n\"We need to be constantly engaging with them online, educating them about 'stranger danger' and encouraging them to speak to a trusted adult if they ever feel uncomfortable,\" Ms Grant said. \nThe app developer has been contacted for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:33:58.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
