But many Australian state and territories do not have explicit laws requiring the reporting of child abuse complaints.\nKieran Tapsell, an Australian civil lawyer with expertise on canon law, said that meant many church leaders were still bound by pontifical secrecy. \n“I don’t think there’s any doubt, if there were no civil laws requiring reporting, then the pontifical secret still applies,” Tapsell said.\n\n“So in Western Australia and Queensland, for example ... bishops are under an obligation under canon law not to report to police. Now I would take my hat off to them if they breached it ... but it is still the law.”\nBut another canon lawyer, Rodger Austin, told the royal commission there was nothing in canon law that prevented the reporting of abuse to civil authorities. Austin said aspects of canon law required Catholics to be bound by the teachings of the church. He said the teachings required individuals to follow civil laws.\n4,444 victims: extent of abuse in Catholic church in Australia revealed Read more \n“If the teaching of the church says you observe the civil laws, then that applies to this case,” he said.\nThe royal commission is likely to recommend that all states and territories implement a mandatory reporting requirement. \nChild abuse campaigner, abuse survivor, and ambassador for Bravehearts, Damian De Marco, issued a statement on Thursday calling for mandatory reporting to be introduced. \nHe said most Australian church leaders were still not under such an obligation, meaning canon law required them to maintain secrecy. \nThe hearing continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:35:37.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
