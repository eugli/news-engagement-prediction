Photo: AP \nHowever there is a specific exclusion - taxis. Taxi drivers have to pay GST no matter what they earn. The ATO had ruled Uber drivers were taxi drivers, meaning they were not exempt from the tax. \nIn court in July, Uber had argued it was not a taxi service, and therefore was exempt from GST. \nUbers couldn't pick up passengers without a booking, nor could they use a taxi rank – and therefore they did not qualify as taxis, the company argued . \nThe Tax Office argued the legislation might say \"taxi\", but really meant all vehicles that drove people from place to place for a fare. It quoted six dictionary definitions of the word taxi to argue that it was a broad term, rather than specific to yellow-painted-cars with taxi metres. No special meaning \nIn a ruling handed down on Friday Justice John Griffiths found the word \"taxi\" should be given \"their ordinary, everyday meanings and not a trade or specialised meaning\". \n\"The ordinary meaning of the word 'taxi' is a vehicle available for hire by the public and which transports a passenger at his or her direction for the payment of a fare,\" the Justice wrote. \nThe Justice also found a taxi did not need to have a taxi-metre, pick up fares without a booking or be able to use a taxi rank in order for it to be considered a taxi. \nIn a brief statement Uber said it was disappointed with the court's decision. \nThe ATO has been contacted for comment. \nMore to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T10:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:28:37.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
