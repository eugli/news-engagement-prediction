Jahlil Okafor (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:30 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:30 a.m. ET \nThe 76ers trading Jahlil Okafor appears to be more real than ever, as coach Brett Brown acknowledged that a potential deal involving the center was the reason Okafor did not play Saturday night against the Heat. \nA deal was not imminent as of Saturday, but Philadelphia is believed to be in talks about Okafor with several teams. While the 76ers have been negotiating with the Bulls and Pelicans, the Trail Blazers are also in mix, ESPN.com reports . \nMORE: Ranking the best NBA stars to change teams in their primes \n\"There were trade rumors that were happening before the game,\" Brown said after the Sixers' 117-109 win over Miami, per CSN Philadelphia . \"I was aware of those. In those situations, I felt that it was best to not complicate things and not play Jahlil. We talked about it together before the game and I explained to him that this was going to happen for this reason. That’s why I made the decision.\" \nOkafor’s teammates did not know the reason he was benched Saturday, according to the CSN report. Okafor started several times over the last few weeks with Joel Embid out with a knee injury; when Embid has been healthy, he hasn’t got a lot of minutes. About 20 minutes before Saturday’s tip, Nerlens Noel was told he was getting the starting nod. \nBrown said that as long as trade talks are progressing, Okafor will stay on the bench. \n\"As the All-Star break gets closer, possible deals have more of a chance,\" Brown said. \"Although speculation is rampant all throughout stuff, you learn that as the deadline gets closer, the reality that something could happen goes to a higher level. When we get to this stage of the calendar, it influences those types of decisions tonight.\" \nThe 76ers have two more games before next weekend’s All-Star break and the Feb. 23 trade deadline — Monday at the Hornets and Wednesday at the Celtics.
