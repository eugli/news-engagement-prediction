A post shared by John Legend (@johnlegend) on Feb 22, 2017 at 1:06pm PST \n\"As you can see, millions are gathered in the National Mall, awaiting my arrival!!,\" Legend wrote on Instagram, paired with a shot of the same scene where Trump was inaugurated — only, completely empty. The post riffs off a tweet that went viral, comparing the 2009 and 2017 inaugurations. The crowd size comparison, from 2009 and today. pic.twitter.com/iMYZy9PRK8 \n— Matt Viser (@mviser) January 20, 2017 \nNo word on how Trump feels about the millions waiting for Legend, but knowing him, he might have some thoughts to share with us all soon.
