John Corina said. \nThe man then pulled a semi-automatic handgun from his waistband and opened fire at the officers, who were wearing bulletproof vests and shot back, Corina said. \n\"They walked up on the vehicle believing the motorist was in need of medical help and then they ended up in a gunfight for their lives,\" Sheriff Jim McDonnell said. \nWhittier Police Chief Jeff Piper wept as he described Boyer as a friend of more than 25 years. \n\"All of us have been grieving,\" the chief said. \"And I didn't think I had any tears left.\" \nGov. Jerry Brown issued a statement of condolence. Capitol flags were ordered to be flown at half-staff in his honor. \nThe suspect, a 26-year-old gang member, had a history of serious crimes and had been granted early release from Los Angeles County jail about a week ago, Corina said. He didn't know the nature of his offense. \nHis name wasn't immediately released. \nEarlier Monday, he shot and killed his cousin in East Los Angeles and took his car, which later rear-ended another car in the neighboring city of Whittier, Corina said. \nRead more at the Associated Press We are your mid-day LIVE NEWS ROOM!
