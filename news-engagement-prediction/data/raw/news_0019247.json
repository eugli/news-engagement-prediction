Unifor national president Jerry Dias told reporters he was there to defend the right Local 113 members to leave the local’s parent association, the Maryland-based ATU International, and join a Canadian union instead. ( Nathan Denette / THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo ) By Ben Spurr Transportation Reporter Tues., Feb. 7, 2017 Canada’s largest private sector union has joined forces with the deposed leader of TTC workers in what is shaping up to be a bitter dispute over the future of the transit employees’ union. Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, which represents more than 300,000 workers across Canada, appeared at a Tuesday morning press conference alongside Bob Kinnear, who was ousted as the president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113 last week . The local represents more than 10,000 TTC workers. Dias told reporters he was there to defend the right Local 113 members to leave the local’s parent association, the Maryland-based ATU International, and join a Canadian union instead. “Canada is the only country in the world that will allow a union from another country to organize their workers,” Dias said, adding that he was “sick and tired of the heavy handed arm of the United States determining our collective bargaining strategy and determining how we operate.” “This is about democracy. It’s about Canadian workers having a say,” he said. Article Continued Below Last Friday, ATU International locked Kinnear and other union executives out and placed Local 113 under a trusteeship, two days after Kinnear filed a request to the Canadian Labour Congress that put the local on the path to potentially breaking away from the ATU. The association represents 190,000 transit workers in the U.S. and Canada. Dias and Kinnear vowed to let the local’s membership decide which union represents them. In order to force a vote, Unifor would have to make an application to the Ontario Labour Relations Board by the end of March proving that it had signed up at least 40 per cent of the local’s members. If, in the subsequent election, a majority voted for Unifor, the Canadian union would become the local’s new representative. In a press conference in the same hotel an hour earlier, Manny Sforza, the trustee installed by ATU International to lead the local after Kinnear’s ouster, said the issue of affiliation didn’t need to go to a vote because 85 per cent of Local 113’s stewards had already signalled their support for staying with the ATU. Sforza, who was flanked by about two dozen occasionally raucous union officials, accused Kinnear of “plotting in secret” to defect to Unifor. As evidence, he cited emails that appear to show Kinnear’s spokesperson in contact with Unifor representatives before ATU International ousted him. An email from Unifor’s lawyer appears to advise the local of what to do in the event that ATU International imposed a trusteeship. It was dated a day before the trusteeship was imposed. “This damning evidence clearly demonstrates that Mr. Kinnear co-ordinated with Unifor, has orchestrated the events of the past weeks and months to create an opportunity for Unifor to raid Local 113,” Sforza said. He said that local members had a message for Kinnear. “You’ve been exposed. Your game is over. Local 113 is not for sale!” he shouted, to applause from the assembled union members. Kinnear, who was first elected Local 113 president in 2003, denied that he had done anything wrong. Speaking to reporters, he wouldn’t specify when he began talking to Unifor about breaking away from ATU International, but said that he had been discussing the issue with labour groups “for years.” “I’ve had conversations with Canadian unions and the Canadian labour movement to ensure that we would have support if, in fact, the ATU came down with the heavy hand that they did,” he said. Michael Lynk, an associate professor at Western University and an expert in labour law, said that there is a long history of Canadian locals breaking away from American-based parent unions. Forty years ago, about 70 per cent of unionized workers in Canada belonged to an international union, he said, while today the number is about 20 to 25 per cent. He said the battle for Local 113’s members is “high stakes” for both Unifor and ATU International. The latter represents transit workers at three dozen other Canadian locals. If Unifor is successful in peeling away TTC workers, Lynk said, “I would assume that Unifor would be knocking on the door of other ATU locals across the province and across the country.” Delivered daily The Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.
