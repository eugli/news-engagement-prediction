An independent investigation is urgently needed Topics: Andrew McCabe , Devin Nunes , Donald Trump , FBI , federal bureau of investigation , Hillary Clinton , House Intelligence Committee , James Comey , Mike Pompeo , Reince Priebus , Richard Burr , Russia , Russia hacks , Russian hack , Russian hacking , Senate Intelligence Committee , Trump Administration , Trump White House , Vladimir Putin , News , Politics News (Credit: AP/Jim Mone/Reuters/Carlos Barria) \nThere are dozens of important political stories percolating at the moment, from President Trump blithely saying that “nobody knew health care could be so complicated” to an administration proposal to slash necessary government programs to the bone to pay for a massive increase in military spending . There are also discussions about putting large numbers of troops on the ground in the Middle East and ongoing horror stories about large-scale deportation of immigrants and harassment at the borders and other points of entry. \nBut there are two stories that keep bubbling up to the surface no matter what else is going on: the investigations into Trump’s possible connections to Russia and his holy war against the press. Indeed, according to Chuck Todd of “Meet the Press,” the two are related . On Sunday’s show Todd reported an apparent pattern: Every time a news organization publishes another story on the Russian investigation, Trump has another tantrum about the media. It’s like clockwork. \nThis pattern doesn’t prove anything other than that the administration is touchy about the story. We can’t conclude it is consciously trying to punish the press for reporting on the Russian stories, or attempting to distract attention from them. Nevertheless, the way the administration has been dealing with the Russian story in other ways certainly raises questions. \nOn Sunday we found out that the White House was so obsessed with leaks that Sean Spicer gathered the White House lawyers and forced his own staff to turn over their personal and work phones to be searched. On Monday it was revealed that Trump had personally signed off on the order. Calling such behavior “Nixonian” is a cliché, but there’s just no way around it. This is paranoid behavior. It’s also revealing, since Trump likes to say the media has no sources and is just making stories up — and yet he’s obsessed with leaks. Something doesn’t add up. \nBut that’s just an internal White House story. As revealing as it is, it’s not as important as the revelation that in the wake of stories that Trump campaign personnel had had “repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election,” press secretary Sean Spicer personally connected journalists with CIA director Mike Pompeo and Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., chair of the Intelligence Committee, both of whom are involved in current investigations into the matter. Spicer even stayed on the line while reporters spoke to those officials. Burr and Pompeo apparently told reporters the stories were “not accurate,” without offering details. (Assuming they were telling the truth, all that means is that something in the stories was inaccurate, not that they were entirely false.) \nThis news came as a follow-up to an earlier report that the White House had reached out to Republican members of intelligence committees in the House and Senate to get them to knock down the Russian-connection stories. House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes, also a member of Trump’s executive transition committee, denied that the White House had pressured him, but nonetheless went on record to assure the country there was nothing to the allegations. How could he possibly know that? The investigation hasn’t really even begun. \nThe point here is that it is improper for the White House to use the CIA director and the heads of congressional committees as its P.R. damage control department. It’s particularly improper for this collusion to happen in a case in which the latter are personally involved in the investigations in question. But let’s face facts. These scandals are almost always partisan affairs. Even if Spicer and the White House had not displayed outrageous disregard for normal protocol, it’s highly likely that a special prosecutor or a bipartisan commission would have been needed at some point to take up the investigation. That’s even more obvious now. \nAs troubling as all this White House outreach to congressional Republicans is, it’s nothing compared to the inappropriate interactions between White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and the deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe. Their contact apparently concerned that same New York Times story concerning connections between the Trump campaign and Russian officials before the election. \nPriebus went on the Sunday talk shows and said that he’d been told by intelligence officials that there was nothing to the story and further that he had been authorized to say so publicly. That’s an odd thing to say and as it turned out Priebus, like Spicer, had tried to get the FBI to “publicly knock down media reports about communications between Donald Trump’s associates and Russians known to US intelligence.” \nThat’s not just inappropriate or unethical, it could be obstruction of justice . At the very least it violates longstanding Department of Justice rules going back to Watergate that prohibit such contacts between the bureau and the the subjects of an FBI investigation. (One of the articles of impeachment introduced against Richard Nixon was for “interfering or endeavoring to interfere” with an FBI investigation.) \nThis is undoubtedly why the White House amended Priebus’ comments days later, saying that the FBI’s McCabe had actually approached Priebus to tell him the Times story was “bullshit.” It was then that Priebus asked the FBI to “knock down” the story publicly, which the FBI told the White House it could not do. But CNN has reported that, according to the White House, both McCabe and FBI director James Comey “gave Priebus the go-ahead to discredit the story publicly, something the FBI has not confirmed.” \nIt’s certainly possible that the White House is misrepresenting the FBI’s involvement. The Trump administration’s credibility gap is the size of the Grand Canyon and growing. But if the Priebus account is correct, we are once again looking at an FBI that is behaving in a partisan and unprofessional manor on behalf of Donald Trump. In this case its conduct may even be illegal. After Comey’s overt interference in the election and his refusal to sign on the the original reports of Russian interference, it’s mind-boggling that everyone in the bureau, especially Comey himself, would not go to epic lengths to avoid even the slightest whiff of impropriety. \nThis might all add up to nothing in the end. But at this point these unethical and possibly illegal contacts between the White House and various agencies, congressional officials and the FBI have made an independent investigation an absolute necessity.
