In the fortnight since President Trump was inaugurated , Americans have expressed their displeasure with his administration by calling their representatives , marching in the streets, donating to nonprofits, signing petitions—and boycotting the companies associated with him. These moves have varying degrees of impact (and satisfaction), but it seems like putting money where your mouth is is, unsurprisingly, the fastest way to get someone’s attention. Yesterday, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick announced he is stepping down from his role on Trump’s economic advisory council. The decision follows the public outcry and #boycottUber and #deleteUber hashtags that popped up after their (poor) handling of the travel ban enacted last weekend: Uber continued to service New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport during protests , even as a taxi union declared a strike. Kalanick’s connection with Trump and seeming endorsement of the ban (or, at least, the choice not to side with protesters) was a one-two punch that found a reported 200,000 customers deleting their Uber accounts within just a few days. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration, but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that,” Kalanick wrote in an email to his employees yesterday. And while that decision may have been in the company’s best financial interest, not moral imperative—many of those lost customers made a point of signing up for Uber’s competitor Lyft—it still demonstrates what much-maligned “hashtag activism” can do, at least when it’s coupled with real action. The Uber news came the same day Nordstrom confirmed that it would stop carrying Ivanka Trump’s fashion line. The company’s statement doesn’t mention politics, but poor sales: “Each year we cut about 10% [of brands] and refresh our assortment with about the same amount. In this case, based on the brand’s performance we’ve decided not to buy it for this season.” Ivanka’s clothes and shoes are still carried at retailers like Macy’s and Lord & Taylor. While other companies have faced backlash in recent memory for their views—Chick-fil-A’s condemnation of same-sex marriage and Hobby Lobby’s refusal to cover certain forms of employees’ birth control—they didn’t execute an immediate about-face following the public outcry. The current rage against President Trump and the relative ease of social media trends suggest that American corporations should be careful about how they express their inflammatory views. Social media is also the key if consumers are seeking information about which brands have a continued association with Trump. #GrabYourWallet provides a fluid spreadsheet of the retailers carrying Ivanka’s line, as well as advertisers buying commercial airtime during The New Celebrity Apprentice . It also offers scripts for what you can say to company management to emphasize your boycott. The name of the organization refers, of course, to Trump’s unforgettable comments about women’s genitals . This is a man who prides himself first and foremost on his business acumen: His words didn’t keep him from winning, but the almighty American dollar might.
