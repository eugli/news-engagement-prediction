A case of cheating under the Income Tax Act against four people has been registered at Raipur Rani police station. \nThe complainant Dr Jitendar Nath Sharma claimed that 2-3 months after one Deirdre Eireannach, of London, became her online friend, he started receiving calls, allegedly from the Customs department to pay money to release a consignment he had reportedly received from the woman. On January 23, he received only a receipt from Delta Courier of the items sent. No parcel ever reached him, even as he paid Rs 85,000. \nHe was then lured into depositing another Rs 1.98 lakh on the pretext of having to clear a draft of pound 30,000. A woman Shalini Gupta, who posed as Chief General Manager of RBI, Delhi, called him to pay the same. \nThe doctor, finally, got suspicious when he was asked to deposit Rs 5.1 lakh as income tax for the money ( 30,000 pounds around Rs 30 lakh) he had reportedly received. He approached the police. \n“The case has been sent to Economic Offences Wing of Ambala Police. We have booked Deirdre Eireannach, George Delta Courier, Patrick, Shalini Gupta and Rajkumar,” said Raipur Rani SHO Vrish Bhan. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:15:42.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
