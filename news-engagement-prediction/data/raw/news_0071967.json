The film was originally aired at the Women’s March on Washington on Jan. 21, but wasn’t released online until last Friday. \nThe film begins with a quote from Hillary Clinton’s concession speech playing over an old radio: “Never stop believing that fighting for what’s right is worth it.” \nWe then see a grandmother looking through an old box of feminist treasures. She pulls out pictures of rallies, an old megaphone crowded with stickers and even an army jacket that has “Mother Nature” painted on the back. Although the granddaughter wasn’t interested at first, she sit downs with her grandmother to learn about what she fought so hard for all those years ago. \n“For me the film is a reminder that you’re never too young or too old to care, to do something, to have an impact,” Beltran told Mashable . “Younger generations often take for granted the things their parents and grandparents had to fight for, but eventually it’s important to look back and appreciate.” \nThe two-minute film ends on a sweet, yet powerful note: As the granddaughter leaves ― now sporting the Mother Nature coat ― she looks up to the window where her grandmother is and they raise their fists to one another in resistance.
