Source: Instagram \nMrs Franklin, who married the AFL star at a secret ceremony last November in the Blue Mountains , said while her wedding was the “best day” of her life this far, only one thing has really changed in their relationship. \n“Day to day stuff hasn’t really changed, we still get up at the same time and go to bed at the same time,” she said. \n“But there’s definitely a deeper connection between us.” Jesinta Franklin poses for David Jones, and will walk at the Autumn/Winter show on Wednesday.

I love chocolate — but do I have it every day? No.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:17:06.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
