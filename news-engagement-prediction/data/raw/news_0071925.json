Liberty \"Libby\" German, 14, and Abigail \"Abby\" Williams, 13, were reported missing February 13 after they went on a hike in Delphi Historic Trails in Indiana and did not show up at a designated meet-up time. After an extensive search, their bodies were found the next day along a railroad bridge near Deer Creek.

Law enforcement agents last week released a grainy photo of a suspect: a white man wearing blue jeans, a blue coat and a hoodie. They are still trying to identify him and have said there may be other suspects. Police on Wednesday said the source of that photo was a video German had taken on her cell phone. Officials also released audio of a male voice saying the words \"down the hill,\" in the hopes the public might identify the suspect's voice.
