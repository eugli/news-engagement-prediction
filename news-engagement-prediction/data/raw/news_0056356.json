After spending the past eight CPACs lamenting Democrats' hold on the government, the conservative activists who frequent the conference are ready to see their years-long struggle for power bear fruit, and it's up to Trump to make it happen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:08:27.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
