A post shared by WWE (@wwe) on Feb 22, 2017 at 7:41pm PST \nBalor, who has been out of action since suffering a serious shoulder injury in August, told the crowd that he still is not medically cleared to compete. But apparently, that didn’t matter and the Demon King didn’t miss a beat as he helped Nakamura fight off an overzealous Roode and Almas. \nAfter the show, Balor tweeted about his return to the Gold Circle of NXT, where he spent nearly two years making a name for himself in WWE. \n— Finn Bálor (@FinnBalor) February 23, 2017 \nThe 35-year-old Balor is expected to return to RAW in the coming weeks and has been advertised to appear at upcoming WWE house shows beginning in early March.
