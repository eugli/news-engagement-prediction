Instead, he's got a grudge against Batman, dating back to 2003 when the Batmobile sped by and winged off one of his rear-view mirrors. \n...Hold up, 2003? \nYep -- just like in the movies, apparently we've got a Batman in Powerless who has been active for quite some time. \nOf course, it's pretty unlikely that the Batman of the show is the same as Ben Affleck's Batman -- that Batarang looks nothing at all like the one seen in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice . \nThe showrunners have referred to Powerless as taking place on \"Earth-P,\" separate from all other current versions of the DC Universe. We don't know a ton yet about the world, other than the fact that at least Batman, Superman, Aquaman , Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern are accounted for -- and most of Batman's most popular rogues are active and well-known by the general public.
