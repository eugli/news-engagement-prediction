She also has her credit card information attached. (Ashley Burke/CBC News)\nOttawa shopper Carmen-Louise Lepin knows first hand what it's like to have her identity stolen.\nMore than a year ago, someone set up five credit cards in her name, then racked up $18,000 in charges in one day alone. Now there's news her PC Plus card could be compromised too. Her credit card is attached to her points card.\n\"They should be more proactive and [have] people dedicated for cyber security, for cyber attacks for the hacking,\" said Lepin.\nLoblaw has reset all of its members passwords and is asking customers via email to change it to a \"new, unique one.\"\nBut Debbie-Lynn Cantin, another Ottawa member, thought the email was spam and pressed delete. She still hasn't changed her password and has had a PC Plus points card since day one.\n\"It's scary,\" said Cantin. \"It's a sad society that we've come to this point.

That's not how it should be.\"\nChange your credit card pin too, warn police Ottawa police are warning shoppers to change their credit card pin number right away.\nStaff-Sgt.Stephanie Burns, who oversees organized fraud investigations, worries shoppers' credit card information could also be compromised.\n\"My concern is if there is credit card information attached, is it possible that credit card information is breached?\" Burns said.\nBurns personally, doesn't have a PC Plus account because she felt the company's application asked for too much personal information.\n\"For me, on that day when I was filling it out, I just didn't feel right about the information,\" said Burns. \"If you're going to give me points why do you need to know the day I was born? What difference does it make?\"\n\"If something in your back of your mind tells you it's not a good idea, then maybe it's not?\" she said, adding that she's not against points cards but wants people to be wary if they feel uncomfortable.\nLoblaw is also asking anyone who thinks their PC points have been stolen to contact them.
