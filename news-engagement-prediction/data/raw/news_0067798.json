Currently, 45 percent approve of the legislation compared to a poll back in January—before President Trump took office—that showed 41 percent of voters approved of the bill.\nVIDEO: UPROAR AT TOWN HALLS AIMED AT REPUBLICANS OVER OBAMACARE \nKyle Dropp, the co-founder of Morning Consult, told Politico that the closer ObamaCare comes to the chopping block, its weekly poll “has shown an uptick in the law’s popularity.”\nThe only item in the poll that remained unpopular was the individual mandate.\nTrump, who said during his campaign that he will replace the law with “something far better,” has tried to calm critics who say Republicans are divided on the issue.\nTrump has been edging away from the promise to quickly eliminate the entire law. Still, annulling its taxes would be a partial victory and is irresistible for many GOP lawmakers and the conservative voters at the core of their support.\n\"We should do full repeal,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a leading House conservative. \"And full repeal means not taking the taxes\" from people.\nDR. MARC SIEGEL'S ADVICE FOR THE OBAMACARE TRANSITION \nDespite the law’s apparent increase in popularity, just last week the CEO of Aetna said in an interview that the law is in a “death spiral” because younger, healthier people have dropped out while premiums continue to climb.\nUnder the 2010 law, people are required to have health coverage or risk fines from the IRS -- a penalty usually deducted from a taxpayer's refund. That underlying requirement remains on the books, and taxpayers are still legally obligated to comply, the IRS said.\nBut the agency is changing its approach to enforcement. Originally, the IRS had planned to start rejecting returns this year if a taxpayer failed to indicate whether he or she had coverage. Now the IRS says it will keep processing such returns, as it has in the past.\nMany of the law's supporters consider the coverage requirement essential for nudging younger, healthy people into the insurance pool to keep premiums in check.\n\nEdmund DeMarche is a news editor for FoxNews.com.
