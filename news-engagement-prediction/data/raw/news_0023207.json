Jeff Sessions as U.S. attorney general.

RT now if you believe it is wrong for the GOP to silence @SenWarren for trying to read a letter from Coretta Scott King. #LetLizSpeak \nâ€” Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) February 8, 2017 This about sums it up. #LetLizSpeak pic.twitter.com/SVMPHq2ABZ \nâ€” elyse kort (@elysekort) February 8, 2017 tempted to make a master post for all the present political issues parks and rec solves in a half hour #LetLizSpeak pic.twitter.com/JU1dWHhdoA \nâ€” Jackie Frost ðŸŒ™ (@maradyeries) February 8, 2017 Thank you @SenWarren for being the soul of the Senate during the #Sessions hearing. #LetCorettaSpeak #LetLizSpeak pic.twitter.com/DQiiO0sOAF \nâ€” Be A King (@BerniceKing) February 8, 2017 FYI: Here's who voted to censure @SenWarren for reading a letter from Coretta Scott King abt Sessions. @SenToomey #nosessions #LetLizSpeak pic.twitter.com/VAbmKu4VPM \nâ€” Tuesdays With Toomey (@TuesdaysToomey) February 8, 2017 To every woman who's been told to \"sit down\"...Let @SenateMajLdr & GOP know you have @SenWarren 's back. Rise up. Don't sit. #LetLizSpeak \nâ€” Resistance DB (@davebernstein) February 8, 2017 \nBack when King wrote the letter, Sessions (then an Alabama prosecutor) was accused of making racist comments and criticised for prosecuting a civil rights activist who was registering black voters. \n\"Anyone who has used the power of his office as United States Attorney to intimidate and chill the free exercise of the ballot by citizens should not be elevated to our courts,\" King wrote. \n\"Mr. Sessions has used the awesome powers of his office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters. For this reprehensible conduct, he should not be rewarded with a federal judgeship.\" \nThe Senate Judiciary Committee voted against confirming Sessions as a federal judge. Now, more than 30 years later, the Senate is debating on whether to elevate him to an even more powerful position. \nElizabeth Warren, however, will have to participate from the sidelines.
