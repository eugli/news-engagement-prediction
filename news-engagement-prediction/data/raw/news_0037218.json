Mandel only needed to look to earlier today, at the confirmation hearing for prospective U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, for a sickening example: Okay, I honestly can't believe I need to explain this to @JGreenblattADL and @ADL_National , but here's why their silence is deafening: \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 Today, a Democratic senator (Menendez) grilled a Jewish ambassador-designate to Israel over suspicion of dual loyalty. This matters because \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 aside from the obvious, there's a lot of history here. This from JJ Goldberg summarizes the history well: pic.twitter.com/EA5IT9NzSQ \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 In other words, it was a loooong time before a Jew would even be considered noncontroversial for the Israel post b/c of dual loyalty. So, \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 when Menendez interrogated Friedman over his loyalty, he called back to a time when Jews weren't trusted in gov't *because they were Jews* \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 There is no other description for this than rank anti-Semitism. It can't even pose as anti-Zionism! Menendez wasn't critical of Israel, \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 he was critical of the idea that a Jew like Friedman would put his country first. Indeed, he focused on the \"passion\" that Friedman has \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 for Israel, and suggested this would cloud his judgment. He also suggested Friedman might take orders from Netanyahu instead of Trump! \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 There is literally no defense of this. Indeed, Friedman during the hearing was slammed repeatedly for his suggestion that Team Obama's \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 classic canard that moneyed Jews were trying to buy Congress on Iran to protect Israel qualifies as anti-Semitic. You may disagree w/him \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 but point his: Dems said HOW DARE YOU take offense at hints of dual loyalty. And then in the same hearing Dems accused him of dual loyalty! \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 It is actually insane. The silence from those who spent two days hitting Trump–deservedly!–over his avoiding the anti-Semitism question \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 sat and watched a Jew be accused of dual loyalty by the party that's going to vote against his nomination. Amazing! \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 If, say, Hillary had nominated a Cuban envoy to Cuba, and Republicans had asked him or her that question, it would've been an earthquake. \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 And yet, because it was a Democrat, crickets. So three brief but important lessons before we wrap this up. First: the journos and officials \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 who said nothing today about Menendez should be completely and totally ignored when they complain about anti-Semitism, because they showed \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 that they don't actually care about anti-Semitism–indeed, they approve of it!–when it's directed at a Republican by a Democrat. So \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 to these folks, anti-Semitism is a purely partisan cudgel. The second important lesson here is related: Where on God's green earth are the \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 Jewish organizations??? The @ADL_National tweeted again in the last half hour, still about Trump's presser. NOTHING on Menendez. Which \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 should shame @JGreenblattADL to no end. Such groups are partisan organs, and they are–crucially–proving that they don't have your back \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 if you're the \"wrong\" kind of Jew: Orthodox or Republican. You're on your own. That's dangerous, b/c it signals to the broader public \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 that maybe anti-Semitism isn't really a problem, that it's all in the Jews' heads, and that anyway it's open season on certain Jews–the \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 ones who LOOK Jewish. So it's not just about condemnation. It's about the real danger @ADL_National & the media are putting Jews in. yes, \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 you read that right. ADL is putting Jews in danger, slapping targets on the back of anyone suspected of being Jewish. And the last lesson: \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 What Menendez and the Democrats did today, and what @ADL_National and others are doing with their silence, is casting a pall of suspicion \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 over anything Friedman does or says now, esp. if he's confirmed as ambassador. It was the green light to wonder, the whole time he's amb, \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 if he's really loyal to the United States or if he's taking orders from the Israeli government. And that's appalling. Quite simply, today \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 the Democrats attempted to hobble a president by suggesting his Jewish ambassador to Israel can't be trusted. Fuel on the fire. And what of \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 the Dems who sat there? Looking at you, @CoryBooker . How could you let that go? How can you look yourself in the mirror? And then there's \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 the shomer himself, who has yet to comment on all this, @SenSchumer . Senator Schumer, do you have something to say about this? \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 So that's what we learned today. Make sure you don't ever forget who was silent today when Menendez accused David Friedman of dual loyalty \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 and his party, journalists who supposedly care about anti-Semitism, & groups like @ADL_National offered nothing but silent approval. \n/end. \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017 Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:25:37.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
