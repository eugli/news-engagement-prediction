Rowling and Piers Morgan embody the extremes of online celebrity, in one fight   11 at 6:41 PM   \nTwo very famous British people are fighting online. One, Piers Morgan, has become one of the most reliable hate shares of Liberal Twitter. And J.K. Rowling, his foil, is one of its greatest “heroes.” \nWhy are they fighting? For starters, Rowling very much enjoyed this clip from “Real Time with Bill Maher” in which Morgan defends President Donald Trump, and Maher’s guests tell him to do something that is unprintable at The Washington Post, even on our website. The clip is below, but please: don’t play it unless you are okay with strong language. Thank you. \nBoth Rowling and Morgan regularly inspire headlines from their tweets. So when Rowling did this: Screenshot, Twitter \nAnd Morgan did this: Screenshot, Twitter \nIt was inevitable that this fight was going to become a *thing.” It also did not end there. Screenshot, Twitter Screenshot, Twitter Screenshot, Twitter The superior, dismissive arrogance of rabid Remain/Clinton supporters like @jk_rowling is, of course, precisely why both campaigns lost. \n— Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) February 11, 2017 Screenshot, Twitter Would you like me to explain why all your political views keep being defeated at the ballot box? https://t.co/mqljwmSeJC \n— Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) February 11, 2017 \nThere are… more tweets. Many more. Rowling eventually gets in these burns: . @piersmorgan If only you'd read Harry Potter, you'd know the downside of sucking up to the biggest bully in school is getting burned alive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:25:40.582+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
