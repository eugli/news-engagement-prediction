We have rules in Malaysia. While in Malaysia, everyone has to obey and follow our rules and regulations... that includes North Korea,\" he told Bernama this morning. \nKhalid was commenting on North Korean ambassador to Malaysia Kang Chol's statement yesterday accusing Malaysia of purposely rejecting their claim for the remains of Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. \nKang Chol made the statement to the media in the compound of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, Kuala Lumpur Hospital, about 11.45pm last night. \nYesterday, Selangor police chief Abdul Samah Mat said priority to claim the body was accorded to close family members to facilitate identification. \nHowever, to date, only the North Korean embassy here had come forward to claim the remains. \nOn Monday, Jong-nam whose name was stated as Kim Chol in his passport was reported to have died on the way to hospital after complaining about feeling unwell at KL International Airport 2. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:20:14.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
