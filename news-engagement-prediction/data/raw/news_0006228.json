Supreme Court.\nPrior to his latest conviction, court records show the 22-year-old had a history of breaking into homes and of violating probation orders.\nHe was on probation when he murdered Hill as well.\nThe victim, a hard worker and dedicated family man, was hailed as a hero for his attempt to protect his loved ones during the terrifying attack, which happened just before midnight on a Sunday.\nHill noticed someone trying to break into their home near 64th Avenue and 166th Street, and immediately tried to block to the door to keep the intruder outside.\nHe lost the struggle, but called out to his family that an armed robber was inside, giving them a chance to find a safe space to hide.\nHill was shot and died at the scene. None of his family members were harmed.\nPolice said the home invasion was committed at random, and that there was no connection between Green and the property.  \nRelated Stories Repeat offender who gunned down father in front of family apologizes Murdered Surrey realtor fought to give family time to hide, wife says Photos Accused murderer Khouri Lamar Green appears in a Surrey courtroom on July 14, 2015.
