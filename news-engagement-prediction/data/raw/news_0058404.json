Then he’s dropped by Breitbart, and his book deal falls through. As I say, sunlight is the best disinfectant. You’re welcome.” \nMr. Yiannopoulos resigned from Breitbart during a press conference Tuesday, two days after the conservative Reagan Battalion group recirculated a 2016 interview in which he argued that sex between adults in their 20s and 13-year-old children happens “perfectly consensually.” He was also disinvited from giving the keynote address at this weekend’s Conservative Political Action Conference and lost a six-figure book deal with Simon and Schuster. \nThough Mr. Maher appeared to take credit for the fallout, he said it wasn’t his intention to destroy Mr. Yiannopoulos. \n“I wasn’t trying to get him removed from society,” he told The New York Times. “I’m somebody who, many times, people have tried to make go away. They were successful that one time, for six months in 23 years, because that’s how long it was between the two shows [“Real Time” and “Politically Incorrect”]. It just rubs me the wrong way when somebody says, ‘I don’t like what this person is saying — he should go away.’” \nMr. Maher outraged the left after it was announced last week that Mr. Yiannopoulos would be a guest on “Real Time.” The liberal comedian, who has been a longtime proponent of free speech, defended the decision and tore into journalist Jeremy Scahill after he canceled his appearance on the show out of protest. \nMr. Scahill argued that there was “no value” in debating Mr. Yiannopoulos, while Mr. Maher insisted that “nothing could serve the liberal cause better than” to have the conservative exposed. Mr. Maher continued to face criticism after the interview aired because some argued he was too soft on Mr. Yiannopoulos’ more unpopular opinions. \nThe “Real Time” host told The New York Times Tuesday night that he shouldn’t be expected to hold his interviewees accountable for everything they’ve ever said or done. \n“I had eight minutes with him, on the show itself,” Mr. Maher said. “Sorry I don’t have time to go over everything everybody else would want to do. We just had time to, sort of, start a discussion of the broad view of who he is. I don’t think he frankly knows what he’s going to say half the time, or knows what his philosophy is. But to see him as this monster is a little crazy. You know what he is? He’s the little impish, bratty kid brother. And the liberals are his older teenager sisters who are having a sleepover and he puts a spider in their sleeping bag so he can watch them scream. \n“Can he do damage? I suppose he can. To a degree,” he said. “Not a great degree, I don’t think. Could he offend people? Could he even inspire a borderline person to do something violent? I guess so. But nothing is free in life. People seem to want to live in this world where everything is a win-win. That’s not how life works.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:04:23.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
