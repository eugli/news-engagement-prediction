Samsung Galaxy S8+ spec sheet. Impress your friends, confound your enemies…with knowledge. pic.twitter.com/lHrHge8BUa \n— Evan Blass (@evleaks) February 22, 2017 \nWhile Blass had previously hinted at the possibility of a 6.2-inch screen for the plus-sized Galaxy S8 on another occasion , it remains to be seen how Samsung makes use of the rounded corner design to improve on the overall screen to bezel ratio. \nGiven that both variations of the S8 are expected to sport the exact same Super AMOLED panel, the differences between the smaller and the bigger model are still unclear. \nIn addition to the large screen, the plus-sized flagship device pack an iris scanner, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage with an option for a MicroSD card. It will also be water-resistant, and support wireless charging and Samsung Pay. \nChances are the S8 – in both variations – will become the first smartphone to cram Qualcomm’s all-new Snapdragon 835 processor . Samsung might also debut its own virtual assistant Bixby along with the new flagship device. \nAccording to Blass, Samsung will announce the device later in March with the official launch date set for mid-April.
