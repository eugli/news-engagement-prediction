And 87 per cent said it was too difficult to achieve the traditional home ownership dream of a freestanding house. \n“Over the last few years, we have seen a dramatic surge in the number of people embracing apartment living. And, when you look at the level of apartment construction taking place across the country, it is likely that we will continue to see more Australians calling apartments ‘home’,” Mr Flavell said. \n“We need to find a way to either cool the market down, or help Australians who are struggling to get their foot on the property ladder achieve their dream of home ownership.” \nTaj Singh, co-founder of lobby group First Home Buyers Australia, said the appetite from first-home buyers for a house had changed over the last year. \nThe great Australian dream of a house on a quarter-acre block is fast fading.

To buy a house it cost four times the average salary – today, the same home costs at least 12 times the average salary,” Mr Stokes said at an Urban Development Institute of Australia NSW event. \n“As Sydney moves away from the traditional red brick home with a backyard in the suburbs, Australians need a diversity of housing choice other than just an apartment or a house.” \nHe pointed to the “missing middle” of terraces, townhouses and duplexes as a valid alternative that has been “missing” for decades in the Sydney market.​", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:43:34.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
