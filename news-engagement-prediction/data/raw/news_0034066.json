Speaking previously to the Daily Telegraph, the mother of two spoke of how love blinded her to what happened next. 'I found myself in a relationship with someone who would tell me what to wear, if I went to the city I had to bring my parking tickets back to show where I was,' she said. 'But I didn’t see it, I thought \"he loves me so much\" rather than having a realisation of that’s not normal.' Renae said Sam, whose name has been changed, quickly won her over as he sent flowers. She called their relationship 'intoxicating' Renae (pictured here on a recent trip to India) said Sam once choked her until she passed out Speaking to New Idea in support of the magazine's domestic violence campaign , We Care, Renae said Sam, a professional fighter, never laid a hand on her daughters, but began to use his own moves and holds on her - once choking her until she passed out. She said she suffered a broken rib, dislocated arm, broken finger and numerous black eyes at the hands of her boyfriend. But she would continue to stay, thinking she could 'help him'. She said he became increasingly controlling and would tell her what to wear. He would force her to reveal everywhere she was going Renae (pictured on a recent trip) finally left him and began seeing a therapist One night she claimed Sam poured a two-litre bottle of Coke over her head as he heated up oil in a pan and threatened to throw it over her. Sam was arrested and given an AVO, but Renae told New Idea her ex did not stay away. She said the final straw came one day when the couple were on a staircase that led up to the roof of Sam's apartment and he suddenly pulled her legs from underneath her. 'I smashed my face on the stairs,' she told New Idea. 'He stamped on my ribs, I couldn't breathe.' She claimed he then held a broken Champagne flute to her neck and threatened to throw her off the building. Renae recently celebrated her one-year anniversary with her new beau, 31-year-old Morten Horsley (pictured) who she said is the kindest man she has ever met After Sam threatened to kill himself, Renae said she coaxed him into returning to his apartment and convinced him to let her leave. She went straight home, locked every window and door and booked an appointment with a therapist the next day. She said she was speaking out to help others trapped in violence. Renae went on to finish place eighth in Series Six of Masterchef and is now enjoying life as a food and travel writer as well as a vegetarian chef. She also recently celebrated her one-year anniversary with her new beau, 31-year-old Morten Horsley. Renae said he is the kindest man she has ever met.
