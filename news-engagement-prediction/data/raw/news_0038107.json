Man lets girlfriend have sex with other men but he must stay faithful \nThe rapist, Raymond Gates, 29, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nine years in prison. \nThe victim claims that Lonina set up the rape, but Shamansky calls that allegation ‘unmitigated nonsense’, adding: ‘Streaming it live was wrong on every level, and she knows that. \n‘This was an appropriate resolution to a difficult case.’ \nFor legal reasons, the victim cannot be named.
