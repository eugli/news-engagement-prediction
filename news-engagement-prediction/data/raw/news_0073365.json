It was a simpler time, when a few games of Snake was all your portable phone could offer in the way of entertainment. Those days are back. And we couldn't be more thrilled. \nThe rebirth of the majestic Nokia 3310 - the phone that could do nothing more than make calls , send texts and wake you up in the morning with the world's loudest alarm - is joyful news for hipsters and technophobes alike. The old 3310 was known for being completely indestructible, unlike some modern smartphones \nW ith its distinctive ringtone, compact design and addictive game, it was one of the first mobiles to become a cultural icon . So beloved was it, that the 3310 was chosen as one of the first 'National Emojis' for Finland, referred to as \"The Unbreakable\" as it was know for its toughness. \nThe new version - unveiled by HMD Global, a Finnish company made up largely of former Nokia employees - looks set to emulate the old model, bringing it (mercifully) only slightly up to date. \nThere is no touch screen, the battery life is huge, and it only costs £40 - just some of the reasons why the relaunch of the 3310 is the best news to come out of the tech industry since the year 2000, when the original was launched. 1) The battery won't die after 1 hour 47 minutes Snake is also going to be making a comeback \nT he old model continued working for up to two weeks if you were lucky. The new one is apparently going to be able to last for a month if left on standby. Can you imagine your smartphone lasting a month?! The Nokia 3310 is truly the superhero of the phone world. 2) It barely has internet access \nThe new model will only have a basic 2.5G connection, meaning there will be no access to WhatsApp, Facebook, or Twitter. Imagine life without the constant stream of notifications? If the idea of this makes your palms sweat, you need a Nokia 3310 in your life all the more. Compared | Nokia 3310 new and old 3) You won't be able to check your emails \nE ven during a relaxing weekend away, few can escape the reflex of flicking onto the mail app for a quick browse of their emails. Maybe everyone should have a weekday and a weekend phone - a smartphone for Monday-Friday, when we actually need all the apps we have come to rely on to do our jobs, and a Nokia 3310 for weekends when we desperately need a break from staring at a tiny screen. 4) The new model has a few more mod cons than the original The new model will come with a camera, which the old 3310 certainly didn't have \nI t may be brilliantly low tech, but the new 3310 does have a few tricks up its sleeves. There is an SD card slot for holding music and photos, a headphone jack, a two-megapixel camera (not exactly Instagram worthy, one imagines) and an FM Radio. 5) It has snake Snake will be making a comeback, though it has been modernised a little for the new model Credit: Alamy \nC rucial to the success of the relaunch is the inclusion of Snake (King of games) on the new model. If they hadn't brought Snake back too there would have been uproar. Everyone knows it was the absolute best thing about the Nokia 3310. \nI can't be the only one who whiled away many an hour on the bus playing game after game. Be warned though, it has been modernised somewhat. 6) It's indestructible \nIf you've smashed your iPhone screen more times than you care to admit, you have probably yearned for the days when you could run over your Nokia and it wouldn't break. \nYou could drop a 3310 as much as you liked and it would remain unmarked. In fact, it'd be more likely to leave a dent in the floor than shatter. Nokia 3310 vs iPhone 7 7) Hipsters and technophobes will love it \nT he beauty of the new Nokia 3310 is that millennials will christen it officially trendy because it would have been one of their first phones, and therefore legitimately vintage. But it also happens to be one of the simplest, most low-tech phones out there, so for anyone of a certain age who finds touch screen smartphones infuriating, it will be perfect. It's essentially a phone for hipster grannies. 8) It won't age in 5 minutes \nRemember the tension between people in your year who had a 3410 versus the people with a 3310? These days, kids must have to get a new phone every couple of months in order to stay on top of the latest models. \nThe 3310 is a timeless classic, not to be messed with or unnecessarily updated. With any luck, it'll still be cool in another 17 years. iphone counter 9) It is wonderfully cheap \nC ompared to an iPhone 7, which starts at £599, the new Nokia is just £41. Sure, an iPhone gives you access to every app you could possibly imagine, the joys of the internet, allows you to stream music and tracks your steps. But can it withstand being thrown across a room into a brick wall? Probably not.
