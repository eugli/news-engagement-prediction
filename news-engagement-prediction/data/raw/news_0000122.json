One industry estimate puts the total contribution from all renewables to global power generation at just 11 per cent by 2040.\nLuke Sussams, a senior researcher at Carbon Tracker, said: “Electric vehicles and solar power are game-changers that the fossil fuel industry consistently underestimates. \n“Further innovation could make our scenarios look conservative in five years' time, in which case the demand misread by companies will have been amplified even more.”\nThe switch to low-carbon technologies would help prevent global temperatures rising to a point where climate change becomes particularly dangerous – generally accepted as between 1.5C and 2C above pre-industrial levels – the report said.\nBut the researchers stressed that their projections were based not on the need to address climate change, but purely financial considerations. \nAjay Gambhir, senior research fellow at Imperial, said: “Most low-carbon pathways analysis considers what needs to be done to meet ambitious climate targets like 2C. \n“Here we’ve looked at what would happen to the global energy system and global temperature if the lowest-cost options are deployed, in light of the latest projections of PV [solar panels] and electric vehicle costs. \n“It’s time we fully understood the implications of these technologies’ relentless ride down the cost curve.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:07:03.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
