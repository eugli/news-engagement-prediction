Photo Lizzy Jagger Never before have so many children of famous parents been so celebrated and rewarded for their lineage, and so willing to publicly embrace it. IMG Models alone has more than 25 “children of” on its books, including the latest name, Dylan Brosnan, son of Pierce (also Ethan Peck, grandson of Gregory, and Alessandra Garcia, stepdaughter of Andy). What began with a few random mini-mes (the Jagger kids, Keith Richards’s girls), and picked up steam when Dolce & Gabbana replaced its usual celebrity front row with a millennial children-of front row (and billed it that way), can no longer be dismissed as a coincidence or even a fad. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “It has become a profession to be the son or daughter of a celebrity,” Mr. Tonchi said. And that means we cannot dismiss the associated implications about the end of the meritocracy, and our own complicity — or what Ivan Bart, president of IMG Models, calls “obsession” — therein. Despite the public hoo-ha about nepotism engendered by the recent election, the palpable discomfort with political dynasties and the ambiguity around Ivanka Trump’s role, when it comes to what sells, apparently, lineage matters. This is not to say, of course, that lineage is the only reason these NextGen names are having a moment. They are all attractive. They are generally talented, most forging their own artistic paths in a variety of areas, in music, art and film. They often have large social media followings. But there’s no getting around the fact that their current profile, especially in the fashion world, seems somewhat out of proportion to their achievements thus far. Photo TJ Mizell Their X factor is their parentage; it’s what makes them stand out from the crowd of other attractive, talented peers (and is used in all of the marketing materials). But the Y factor — and this is what’s interesting — is that they are perfectly happy not only to acknowledge it, but also to leverage it. Whereas once upon a time children of famous parents might have changed their surnames in order to prove themselves (see: Angelina Jolie, Emilio Estevez) or even rejected their parents choices, this generation is happy to assume the mantle. After all, if we’re going to be so fascinated by celebrity, and what it may have been like to grow up with celebrity parents — if we’re going to snap pictures of the children eating ice cream and at the park (celebs! they’re just like us!) from the time they are little, and feel, somehow, that we know them because we know their parents — why shouldn’t they use that to their own advantage? “Regardless of what we do in life, every article starts with ‘daughter of,’” Ms. Willis said over the phone from the set of “Empire,” discussing her participation in the Gap ad. “We were all talking about it during the Gap shoot. You can fight that, or accept it and appreciate it. Personally, I love the idea of being a part of something my parents were part of but putting my own spin on it.” NYT Living Newsletter Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.
