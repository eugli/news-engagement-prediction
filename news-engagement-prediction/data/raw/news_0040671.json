Mum stole £2,700 of groceries in elaborate self-service checkout scam \nShe allegedly set up an iPad in the child’s bedroom and clicked on record. \nThe High Court in Glasgow heard that the device caught the teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, attempting to rape the primary school pupil. \nAt one point, he allegedly took out his mobile phone to try and record what he was doing. The 12-year-old caught the incident on her iPad (Picture: Getty) \nAccording to the Daily Record , Prosecutor Paul Brown said: ‘The 12-year-old girl retrieved the iPad a short time later. She reviewed the footage and showed her mother who in turn phoned the police. \n‘At one point in the footage the six-year-old is seen to flinch as if she was in pain.’ \nThe teenage boy from Edinburgh admitted attempting to rape the six-year-old on April 9, 2016. Nazi-obsessed teenager made pipe bomb and praised Jo Cox’s murderer \nHe also pleaded guilty to sexually abusing her and having a number of indecent photographs of children, some of them babies, being sexually abused. \nThe court heard that in total, there were 896 indecent photographs of children over two phones owned by the teenager. \nMr Brown added: ‘Police also searched the accused’s home and found a memory card with three videos of the six-year-old being sexually abused by the accused.’ \nThe teenager will be sentenced at High Court in Edinburgh next month. \nHe will also be placed on the sex offenders’ register.
