MARK TAYLOR/FAIRFAX NZ \nAsh Gower-Rudman is going to use Tinder to pick up rides from Cape Reinga to Bluff to raise money for the New Zealand Aids Foundation. \nGower-Rudman is going on a 12-day Tinder tiki tour of New Zealand and is hoping to raise $3000 for the New Zealand Aids Foundation. He has no personal connection to the charity or the disease - it just sounded like a good cause to him. \nREAD MORE: What are the biggest turn-offs on Tinder? \nHe will use the hook-up app to connect with people to hitch rides from one place to another. Like hitch-hiking, he will be using a thumb, but the thumb will be swiping right instead of catching the breeze on the side of a road as cars whiz past. \nGower-Rudman wanted to stimulate some good energy after 2016 - which seemed \"a bit of a rough year for a lot of people\". \n\"I am a firm believer if you want to better yourself, you should do work for other people and try toi create some good karma,\" Gower-Rudman said. \nHe had been laughing with his friends about the app during the summer break when the wheels started turning in his head. \nAfter that he started making plans for the journey, including trying the app out. \n\"I tried it out for a week and there were some interesting people on it. Yeah, there are definitely some interesting people out there.\" \nGower-Rudman hasn't experienced any horror stories with his Tinder interactions. \n\"Not so far, but I might have a few by the end of this trip.\" \nThe hardest part was getting his parents to realise the trip was not an elaborate plan to meet a lot of women. \n\"They didn't like the sound of it to start with. I had to convince them it wasn't about trying to go around trying to hook up with everyone. Then they got on board.\" \nHis parents, and everyone else, will be able to keep an eye on his travels. Gower-Rudman is going to be Snapchatting and Facebooking his travels on 12 Day Tinder Tiki Tour accounts. \nAnd obviously people can connect with him through Tinder when he hits their area. \nHe starts the journey on Saturday, February 11, in Cape Reinga and obviously hopes to have it all done in 12 days - but he has a few days up his sleeve if he gets stuck somewhere. \n\"Classes start on the 28th of February, so as long as I am back for them, I'm good.\" \nHe is not leaving any girls crying themselves to sleep in the Waikato wondering what he could be up to. \nHe is a single man. \nThat being said, Gower-Rudman is open to the fact that he might meet someone along the way.. \n\"If it happens, it happens, but it's not why I am doing it.\" \nPeople can donate through the Everyday Hero page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:09:50.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
