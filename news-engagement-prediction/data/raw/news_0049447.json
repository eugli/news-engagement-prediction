But while he showed durability, Stroman's numbers weren't so impressive: he finished with a 9-10 record and 4.37 ERA through 32 starts.\nThis year he wants to do better. He took that goal into his off-season training.\n\"I take unbelievable care of my body. I pride myself on that,\" Stroman said. \"[I'm] five-foot-seven, but that's something that I'm very confident in is my body and what I'm able to do out there.\n\"I'm pretty sure I can go out there and throw 200, 220, 240 [innings], I feel like I can do that year-in, and year-out, that's the goal, as well as being dominating each and every outing.\"\nManager has confidence in Stroman Manager John Gibbons showed an unwavering confidence in Stroman when he chose him over veteran left-hander Francisco Liriano to start the American League wild-card game against the Baltimore Orioles last season.\nStroman went six innings that game, allowing two runs and striking out six in Toronto's 5-2 victory.\nGibbons wasn't too concerned with the peaks and valleys of Stroman's 2016 campaign.\n\"The reality of the game at this level is you're not going to be good every time. You're going to get knocked down, especially the young guys,\" Gibbons said. \"He was in that stretch and there were people calling for him to be sent down [to the minor leagues].\n\"We thought he was going to work it out and he ended up hanging in there and turned the season around at the end.\"\nIt was two years ago that Stroman's spring training was cut short by a knee injury that forced him to miss the first five months of the 2015 season.\nHe put his rehab on hold to be able to return that September and pitch into Toronto's first post-season since 1993.\n\"Everyone forgets I came back in five months from a full ACL surgery,\" Stroman said. \"I had to stop my rehab to come back and pitch for September and the playoffs. I had to re-amp my rehab and start it back up in the off-season, so it's not the ideal process you want to go through [for an] ACL rehab.\n\"This year, I feel 100 per cent.\"\nStroman had an eventful off-season, winning his first salary arbitration case to lock up a $3.4 million US salary for the upcoming season. Toronto had offered $3.1. million US.\nHe also announced that he'd be playing for the United States at the World Baseball Classic, which begins next month.\nÂ© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-21T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:17:54.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
