It’s all about the journey you choose to take.

She seemed familiar with her dealer.'\nAnother close friend told The Sun she spoke to Tara a few weeks ago and heard she was 'down and lonely'.\nThe source said: 'That's when she said, 'Every day I want drugs. I'm doing everything I can to stay clean but therapy isn't enough'.\n'I remember those words clearly as there was a sense of desperation. She didn't want to give in, but it was obvious how difficult things had been.\n'Yet she said she was going to try different therapies and was going to 'Rise like a phoenix'. She still had hope.'\nIt came after entrepreneur and gay rights campaigner Ivan Massow appeared on This Morning and said he met Tara 'five or six' years ago when mutual friends decided that he, as a recovering alcoholic, would be a good influence on her.\nHe told the show: 'She was facing a lot of problems. The recurring issue [was] that it was very hard for her to stay off drinking and things.'\n'There was lots of surgery, her nose was giving her problems - she was terribly conscious of it and she always knew her angles - and there was this tumour on top of everything.\n'She was never comfortable to see herself as an older person - she never saw that as her role, and that was very hard for her. She was very frail.\n'I hadn't seen her for over a month, it's been very hard to reach her. With people like this you have to sort of let go with love. You can't badger them, especially because I could see through her behaviour. I was the last person she would call when she was misbehaving.'\nTara's cleaner discovered her body at her London apartment\nPresenter Phillip Schofield asked him: 'Had she got back into that dark place?'\nMr Massow replied: 'I always knew that when I didn't hear from her, that's where she was.'\nViktor Krrashi said he had been friends with Tara for more than 20 years after meeting her in a private member's club in central London.\nHe said her new boyfriend, said to be aged in his 50s with 'grey hair' had 'stopped her visiting' The Bottlery recently, which Mr Krrashi's brother owned.\nMr Krrashi described her partner as 'difficult'.\nHe added: 'She used to come in here all the time and eat steak sometimes but she wasn't a big eater.\n'But when she started seeing this guy, she stopped coming in.'\nHe added: 'They had been seeing each other for the last five months, when I have seen her they've been together.\n'I don't know where he was from but I don't think he was English. I saw her on Saturday afternoon when she was with this guy, she stopped at the door and said hi.\n'She looked thin and ill but even though she was thin she was always happy. She was a great girl.\n'Tara would go missing on her holidays for weeks at a time but when she was here she was very happy.'\nLast year the socialite and model revealed that she had been battling a brain tumour following bombshell diagnosis, along with a rare and unnamed auto-immune disease.\nThe Metropolitan Police today confirmed it has referred the 'unexplained' death to Westminster Coroner's Court.\nFive builders renovating the property since September say they saw the cleaner visit the flat twice a week.\nThe 45-year-old former model had been heard using a vacuum cleaner and walking around her flat the previous Wednesday and had previously complained several times about the builders to the flat's owner.\nThe former It girl, who lived in a plush fifth floor apartment in Earls Court, had failed to collect three items of post from downstairs.\nOne of the builders said: 'We could hear her walking around upstairs last week. She was cleaning. We could hear hoovering on Wednesday.\n'It was the cleaner who found her.

But last ­Friday we heard a very loud bang in the afternoon — like someone or something falling over. We hadn't seen her or heard her since then.'\nFriends also told the paper they believed she may have 'relapsed' into drug use at a party in London before Christmas and were 'concerned' because she looked 'dishevelled'.\nAnother source said she had become a 'recluse' since the tumour was found in her brain.\nThe source told The Sun: 'Her health had left her in a really bad way and she was very low. She thought about death a lot and even disc­ussed her funeral at points.'\nThree months ago, the socialite told the Daily Mail how she feared she was going to die when doctors revealed she had a brain tumour.\nShe said she had received treatment for the non-malignant growth in her pituitary gland since January 2016 and said at the time that it had cleared.\nThe Hampshire-born socialite mixed with royalty and was friends with the Duchess of Cambridge (pictured, left, 2007) and her sister Pippa (pictured, right, at a book launch in London in 2008)\nShe told the Mail in November: 'I went to the doctors to talk about my latest blood test results when I got back from skiing in January. I said: 'What does this mean? Can you translate it?' And the doctor said: 'As I suspected, you have a brain tumour'.\n'I got terribly frightened. I started thinking, I'm going to die, I'm going to die. I've only got a couple of weeks to live. Stuff like that.'\nThe former I'm A Celebrity ...

However, ANCAs are abnormal ones that instead attack cells and tissue within the body. Specifically, they attack the inside - cytoplasm - of a certain type of white blood cells called neutrophils.\nWhen they attack, it causes white blood cells to then infiltrate the walls of other vessels in various organs, leading to vasculitis.\nThe condition, which can either be short or long-term, can cause weakness, blood-filled urine and red spots on the skin. Doctors can diagnose the condition through a blood test to measure levels of ANCAs in the body.\nDrugs are used to reduce the swelling and protect organs from damage, mainly in the form of antibiotics and medication that suppresses the immune system.\nThe condition occurs in roughly one in every 50,000 people - with the average sufferer being 55.\nSource: University of North Carolina\nPalmer-Tomkinson's previous boyfriends include Duran Duran's Nick Rhodes, singer Duncan James, actor Sid Owen, Fiat boss Eduardo Teodorani-Fabbri and Lord Robert Hanson.\nAn interview with the Daily Mail's Jenny Johnston last April revealed she was still single and could not remember when she last had a date - but that she had wanted children when she was younger.\nPalmer-Tomkinson said at the time: 'I thought I'd be married and have two children by now. I imagined I'd be living in the country. I'd have my parents' lifestyle, basically.'\nHer brother James Palmer-Tomkinson was abroad when she died, working in Switzerland for his ski company.\nA spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'Police were called by London Ambulance Service at approximately 1.40pm today to an address in Bramham Gardens, SW5.\n'A woman, aged in her 40s, was pronounced dead at the scene.

As far as I am aware she was living alone.'\nTara Palmer-Tomkinson, pictured in London in 2006 after having her nose straightened in an operation costing £6,000, when her cocaine habit left it on the brink of collapse, having destroyed her septum, the wall of cartilage between the nostrils\nPalmer-Tomkinson (pictured arriving at a fashion show in a Lamborghini Murcielago in 2006) presented a series of TV shows, including What Kids Really Think, Popworld, Top of the Pops and SM:TV Live\nThe socialite's party-loving ways became well-known around London in the 1990s.

It's very sad.'\nAfter her party-loving ways thrust her into the spotlight, she made headlines with a £400-a-day cocaine addiction, which left her needing septum reconstruction surgery in 2006.\nAs she grew up, her family who mingled with the royals during ski trips.

She continued to present and appear on TV through out her life\nDuring her years in the spotlight, she was a newspaper columnist and television personality and had a close relationship with the royal family, attending the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011.\nBut she has previously been at pains to stress how false the image of her socialite life was.\nSpeaking to the Daily Mail last year, she said: 'When I got the It-girl tag it was all about timing. They wanted a real-life Ab Fab person. That was only a small part of who I was.\n'I didn't come from the Paris Hilton world. Mine was privileged, yes, but it was old money. Our house was — is — held together with Super Glue. If a plate breaks, my father fixes it.'\nLast year she also revealed to the Telegraph that she still struggles with self-esteem, admitting that over the years she has been 'destroyed' by people's negative comments regarding her appearance.\nPalmer-Tomkinson claimed she had never been tempted to undergo cosmetic surgery because people had never told her that she looked nice and she had resigned herself to having a 'crooked face'.\nShe said: 'If people said I looked nice every day, I might have been tempted (to have surgery). But my face is really crooked and that's that. It's not all from drugs… or maybe I've got facial dysmorphia. I've been destroyed by the things people have said.'\nShe had a series of celeb boyfriends.

Right: With Eduardo Teodorani-Fabbri in 2009\nPalmer-Tomkinson once dubbed her home in the capital as 'the sexiest apartment in London'.\nAnd in The Mail On Sunday's You magazine in December 2015, she spoke about launching her own label Desiderata, which means 'desired things' in Latin.\nShe said: 'This is not just a project for me. It's a departure in which I am investing my heart and soul.\n'I know I've been irresponsible and naive in the past – I've been a child all my life. But it's time I grew up, and this business is the most grown-up thing I've ever done.'\nSarah Lindsell, chief executive of The Brain Tumour Charity, said: 'Our hearts go out to all of Tara Palmer-Tomkinson's family and friends.\n'Three months ago, Tara was brave enough to speak out about her brain tumour diagnosis and the impact it had on her life.\n'Her honesty helped to raise awareness of the disease and it was welcomed by the many thousands of people in the UK and around the world who cope with the impact of a brain tumour.\n'Tara helped to show why we must do all we can to defeat this devastating disease, which is the biggest cancer killer of children and young people in the UK.'\nVisiting flood-hit Thailand and taking a tour around the Net-a-Porter offices in London: Tara's last tweets The last picture Tara tweeted, from Net-a-Porter's London offices\nTara Palmer-Tomkinson's last tweet was posted on January 11, encouraging others to vote in the National TV Awards.\nBut three days earlier she had posted about witnessing the flooding devastation that had hit the Thai island Koh Samui.\nShe tweeted on January 8: 'I'm home! The floods, disruptions in Koh Samui, beyond horrendous. What I witnessed, experienced at the airport, disruption, chaos, trauma.\n'However, it was SO emotionally overwhelming, the kindness of everyone helping everyone, and my prayers are with those still stuck.'\nHundreds of families on the holiday island were left homeless, bridges were down and many roads became impassable beneath the floodwater.\nAnd the last picture she posted of herself was at the Net-a-Porter offices in London on November 29.\nShe captioned it by saying: 'Honoured to be the first person to experience backstage tour! Thank you to all at Net-a-Porter, aka 'The eighth wonder of the world'!'\nA 'daily kiss with Prince Charles' and a high profile battle with cocaine: How original IT girl TPT went from a Royally-connected socialite to a reality TV favourite\nTara Palmer-Tomkinson's life in the limelight began through her family's close friendship with the Royals.\nHer former Olympic skier father Charles Palmer-Tomkinson forged a lasting bond with the Prince of Wales after teaching him to ski in the 1970s.\nThat friendship continued through the generations, with Tara invited to accompany Prince Charles and his children on numerous skiing trips in Europe.\nShe grew up in an aristocratic family, the youngest of three children. She is pictured, aged 16, with the family dog, Wellington\nShe enjoyed several holidays with the Royals throughout the 1990s at famous ski resorts including Klosters in Switzerland, with Tara and her family understood to join the Prince on at least three vacations per year.\nBefore she found fame she caused a stir in the press when she was pictured at Klosters kissing Prince Charles in 1995, with the public clamouring to find out who this beautiful mystery woman was.\nAnd following Princess Diana's tragic death she became a source of comfort and emotional support for the Prince and his children.\nShe was privileged, talented, gorgeous, wealthy - and famously troubled.\nBy the close of the 1990s this publicly educated, well-heeled woman had become the ultimate IT girl.\nAs a schoolgirl she dreamed of being a concert pianist and should have got round to doing her Grade 8 exam before she left school, but somehow never did.\n'I just wanted to play Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata and other beautiful pieces,' she told The Daily Mail last April.\n'I couldn't be bothered with all the boring technicalities of scales and arpeggios.'\nTara was never afraid to flash the flesh. Pictured, left, in a mini skirt in 2001 and, right, with Pippa Middleton in 2009\nHer early ambitions were 'to ride in the Grand National, be a vet or play piano at the Royal Albert Hall'.\nHer life took a different twist, however, and she burst in the public consciousness during the mid 90s.\nShe effortlessly crossed the line from aristocratic society into celebrity culture and it was impossible to open a copy of Hello! or OK! magazines without spotting her.\nShe was one of the first celebrities to become a 'brand' for no apparent reason, effortlessly amassing a newspaper column, book deals and TV presenting gigs.\nTara was a true eccentric and her appeal lay in her ability to cross both worlds - the old, aristocratic and wealthy while navigating the trappings of modern, reality television star fame.\nIn 2009 she sensationally revealed: 'I have kissed Prince Charles every single day since I was four years old.'\n'HER ADDICTION WAS FAME NOT DRUGS': TARA'S REHAB FRIEND REVEALS IT GIRL'S STRUGGLE WITH CELEBRITY A woman who spent time with Tara Palmer-Tomkinson in rehab in the US in 1999 said 'fame was her biggest addiction'.\nTara attended The Meadows Clinic in Arizona in 1999 for treatment for a cocaine addiction.\nHer friend, who spent several weeks with her in the facility, told MailOnline celebrity was Tara's 'worst enemy'.\nThe woman, who asked not to be named, said: 'Her biggest addiction was fame, not drugs, and it was a very difficult and personal battle.\n'She craved it but it was her own worst enemy. She got her life back on track and she kicked the drugs but what she was never able to kick was the fame.'\nThe woman, who lives in the US, added: 'Tara was the most supportive friend. She made me look good at the centre as we would play the piano and I would pretend to hit the keys while she would play beautifully.\n'She was an incredible artist and was the life and soul of the treatment centre as much as she was the party.'\nShe added: 'There was always a little girl in her that was searching for approval. On the one side there was this funny woman who would say crazy things and on the other was a sweet, shy, fragile girl.'\nThe woman also revealed her father was outwitted by Tara during a family visit day at the centre.\nShe said: 'One day I was lining up for lunch with my dad and Tara came in with a huge bouquet of flowers that she said was from Prince Charles.\n'My father said 'Oh, a little bit of namedropping there Tara?', and she replied, 'No, a BIG bit of name dropping!' She was just so cute.'\nIndeed, there was something of a furore when an adult Tara was seen kissing the heir to the throne in 1995 - but she later revealed the kiss was just 'to thank him for a day's skiing'.\nIt has not been smooth sailing.\nShe was treated for cocaine addiction at The Meadows rehabilitation clinic in Arizona ten years ago, and went on to appear on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!\nMore recently there were reports of odd behaviour, of a very public meltdown at Heathrow Airport where she was arrested.\nIn photographs she has looked pale, gaunt, haunted. And then there was her nose — which famously had to be reconstructed after her cocaine excesses, but which she refused to ever talk about.\nIn the same interview from last year, she described how she liked to ski with 'a tail'.\n'A tail. I mean, not an actual tail, but I take my black fur scarf and put it round me and have it poking out of my ski pants so that it flows in the wind as I go down.' Why? 'Because I like the whoosh as I go.'\nPalmer-Tomkinson appeared on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! in 2002 and finished runner up after being doused in gunge in the jungle shower\nNext came some truly original advice on dating.\n'In the past, whenever I had a date coming over I used to make toast so the house was full of the yummy smell,' she says. 'I decided it would be a man-magnet. Garlic and olive oil works as well, but I think you have to know the person more.'\nIt is anecdotes like these which have kept people interested in her for the past two and a half decades.\nShe once said: 'When I got the It-girl tag it was all about timing. They wanted a real-life Ab Fab person. That was only a small part of who I was.\n'I didn't come from the Paris Hilton world. Mine was privileged, yes, but it was old money. Our house was — is — held together with Super Glue. If a plate breaks, my father fixes it.'\nHer father was Charles Palmer-Tomkinson, a wealthy landowner and former Olympic skier. She was eloquent and self-aware when talking about how she couldn't cope with fame.\nShe says it was less being selfish and hedonistic that led her to drugs, and more about her simply being scared.\nIn her own words: The outrageous anecdotes of a life spent with the in-crowd Tara Palmer-Tomkinson was an eccentric character known for her quirky personality and lavish lifestyle.\nShe was never afraid to offer a soundbite or recall tales of a wild night out and below are some of her memorable Quote: s and anecdotes.\nWhile gaining a reputation for her party-lifestyle, Tara also had a generous side.\nIn an interview with the Telegraph, she recalled how she gave £1,000 to a homeless man after seeing him on the streets of Kensington, west London.\nShe said: ' My boyfriend had given me £1,000 for my birthday and though I wasn't ungrateful, I wished he'd bought a meaningful present like my favourite perfume so I was a bit down in the mouth.\n'I spotted this guy while I was heading to the M3 and drove on, but couldn't stop thinking of this one homeless man out smiling through the freezing weather. On the spur of the moment, I did a U-turn, drove all the way back and gave him £1,000 and he gave me a big hug.'\nTara also liked to play up to her quirky persona and while on Loose Women, explained what it would be like anyone visited her parent's country house.\nShe said: 'I might jump over the dining room table on a pony, my father used to go over hedges on poles, rabbits fly out of cupboards, it's like Gosford Park meets Harry Potter.'\nThe former IT-girl was also a close friend of Prince Charles and one recalled her faux-paus while attending a royal soiree.\nShe said: 'One of my worst moments was when I drank my finger-dipping bowl at a royal party. I thought it was soup. Not only did I drink it, but I asked for the recipe.'\nTara became famous for her taste for the finer things and once remarked that a penchant for a champagne lifestyle was important when picking a partner.\nEspecially when it meant first class air travel.\nShe once remarked: 'I would never go out with a man who, when boarding an aircraft, turned right.'\nThe former IT Girl loved a night-out with celebrity pals in west London or other desirable hot spots and first burst into the spotlight in the 1990s and claimed she never regretted a single moment, even if it meant a few sleepless nights.\nShe told the Daily Record: 'I'm not going to sit there and feel ashamed for what I did, because I have had a life! I might be 44, but I was at so many different parties in so many different countries, I haven't slept for 20 years!'\nTARA'S MOST MEMORABLE SOUNDBITES\nOn romance: 'I have my fair share of admirers.

I'd like to go back to that young girl and shake her. So much was handed to me on a plate.'\nTara's devastating secret illness in her own words: How the former IT girl revealed her brain tumour just three months before her death\nExactly a fortnight ago, Tara Palmer-Tomkinson was photographed for the last time walking outside her flat in London.\nAnd the shocking news of the socialite's death aged 45 from a brain tumour at her home was revealed yesterday, just two weeks after that picture was taken on January 25.\nBack in November last year, the former It girl told the Mail's REBECCA HARDY the shocking news of her diagnosis. Here, we look back at an extract from the interview.\nTara Palmer-Tomkinson arrives early, which is not like Tara at all. More often than not the high-as-a-kite, never-out-of-the-gossip-columns Tara we've known since she burst into the national consciousness more than two decades ago would turn up (if she turned up at all) three days late.\n'I'm not the person I was,' says the former It-Girl. 'I'm much calmer. I don't go to places like Ibiza because the party world scares me.\nPalmer-Tomkinson at the wedding of Lady Melissa Percy to Thomas van Straubenzee at St Michael's Parish Church last year\n'I've gone completely the other way. I'm a very quiet person now, and I like being that person. I have a better perspective on life.\n'It used to really matter what people thought and said about me. Now, it doesn't bother me whether people write that I'm off my face, on my face, in my face, whatever. It's all pretty trivial compared to . . . compared to . . .' The sentence ends in tears as Tara points to her forehead.\nIt is impossible not to want to weep with her. For since January, the 44-year-old has been treated for a brain tumour. The growth in her pituitary gland was discovered following numerous blood tests after she began to feel terribly run down the previous summer.\n'I went to the doctors to talk about my latest blood test results when I got back from skiing in January,' she says. 'I said: 'What does this mean? Can you translate it?' And the doctor said: 'As I suspected, you have a brain tumour.'\n'I got terribly frightened. I started thinking, 'I'm going to die, I'm going to die. I've only got a couple of weeks to live.' Stuff like that.\nPalmer-Tomkinson, pictured, left at a London event in 2003 and, right in 2008, was a stalwart on the capital's social scene\n'It's that word, isn't it? But then one of the doctors said: 'Hang on a minute, would it help if you called it a wart or a growth?'\n'They said: 'Tara, yes, it's a big scary word which you will keep hearing — but don't get out of control over it. A tumour can go across the board of many different things.'\n'I actually feel very lucky. My growth was non-malignant but it affected the production of prolactin [a hormone]. I've been with people who have malignant brain tumours so I don't want to be like, 'Hey look at me'.\n'I have been, touch wood,' she reaches out to touch the oak coffee table in front of her 'luckier. I've taken medication and, thankfully, it seems to have gone away for now.'\nShe added: 'My family has this motto: 'It's always sunny at the top.' As a child, when we were skiing, you'd wake up and it would be a cloudy day with no visibility, so no one else would go skiing.\n'That was not for us. My father would say, 'Come on — out of bed', and we'd trudge to the cable car, skis on our shoulders.\nTara never strayed far from the public eye, appearing in a Walkers Crisps ad (left, in 2004) and on the catwalk the same year\n'Then, there's that moment when the cable car breaks through the cloud. It's indescribable. You absolutely feel on top of the world. You have cloud beneath you, blue sky above you and an empty mountain. I used to think I was in paradise.\n'I feel I'm breaking through the cloud with this. The sun is coming out. I am not going to be that person who lies in bed feeling a victim because of what's happened. I'm going to get on with my business and grab life by the horns.\n'A party doesn't have to be full of lights and music. The party is what you want it to be — and my party isn't over.'\nRead the full interview by clicking here\nTHE TUMOUR THAT USUALLY HITS THE OVER-50s One in ten brain tumours is on the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland that sits just below the brain. The type Tara has is a prolactinoma, a benign (non-cancerous), slow-growing tumour.\nThe pituitary gland is responsible for controlling many of the other endocrine glands in the body, such as the thyroid and adrenal glands.\nIt also makes important hormones such as growth hormone and prolactin, which stimulates the production of breast milk.\nSymptoms : Many pituitary tumours exist for years without causing symptoms and some never do. If the tumour is large (over 10mm) it may press on the optic nerve and cause headaches and visual problems. Most are under 10mm in size.\nThe most common type of pituitary adenoma is 'non-functioning', meaning it stops the gland from producing one or more of its hormones. Alternatively, a tumour may begin to generate an excess of a hormone.\nWho gets them : Benign brain tumours can affect people of any age, although they're more likely over 50. Around 4,300 are diagnosed each year in the UK. Possible causes include genetic conditions and previous radiotherapy to the head.\nTreatment and recovery : Diagnosis is made using a blood test, then a CT or MRI scan. Very few pituitary prolactinoma need surgery as they often can be shrunk using medication. Drugs called dopamine agonists are used to reduce the amount of prolactin produced. Prolactin levels usually fall to normal within a few weeks, symptoms subside and the tumour starts to shrink.\nwww.pituitary.org.uk 'A fun, feisty woman who battled many demons': Piers Morgan leads a host of celebrity tributes to Tara Palmer-Tomkinson as she dies aged 45\nPiers Morgan has led a host of celebrity tributes to Tara Palmer-Tomkinson after she passed away at the age of 45.\nTaking to Twitter, Quote: : 'RIP Tara Palmer Tomkinson, 45.
