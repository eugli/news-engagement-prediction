Feb 22nd, 2017 Photo: YouTube \nSome people sure do experience (and do) some odd things while on the job. You know, like the Houston Realtor who was caught having sex in a house she just sold . Or like the Florida woman who tried to have sex with a cop after crashing her car while topless . Let’s just say these are things that don’t happen everyday. And I’m going to go out on a limb and say that the 100-year-old dude in this story doesn’t exactly get lap dances everyday. But hell, he got one. \nBrittany Fultz, a 26-year-old care worker was busted and arrested after a video filmed by another worker at the Commons of Providence home shows Fultz suggesting explicit ideas to the old man, touching his thigh, grinding on his leg and even pulling her pants down. The man, who has dementia, probably thought he had gone to heaven. Fultz even says this on video: “I can show you new things, I can show you new things, I won’t tell if you won’t. I’m a girl… you know what that means.” Um, that you have a vagina? Photo: Sandusky Police Department \n“It’s disturbing… She is touching him,” Sandusky Police Detective Anthony Bath said. “This was not something he wanted.” Well…I don’t know about that. \nCheck out the crazy video below. \nNot only was the worker who filmed this fired (since they filmed it in December but didn’t release it until recently), but Fultz was also of course fired. Fultz faces a charge of gross sexual imposition, and the possibility of other charges. Photo: YouTube \nI’ve said it once and I will say it again: someone will always be filming you when you’re acting like an idiot. So I can only assume there are tons of videos of me out there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:18:30.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
