First lady, Aisha Buhari, flanked by (r) Toyin Saraki, wife of Senate President, and others after her arrival from Saudi Arabia, yesterday \nSpeculations had been rife that the President would return this weekend barring any last minute changes. This development quickly prompted expectations on The Presidency and Abuja, the federal capital, yesterday. \nSunday Vanguard’s request for confirmation of the President’s possible return, last night, from the Presidency did not yield any fruit as the State House media team seemed not to be in the know of the goings-on. \nAisha Buhari, who returned to the country, yesterday, appreciated Nigerians for supporting her husband’s administration. \nThe wife of the President also prayed for peaceful coexistence in Nigeria. \nShe made the prayer shortly after her arrival at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja from Saudi Arabia where she performed the Lesser Hajj. \nAisha, who arrived at about 3:15 pm, was received by the wife of the Senate President, Mrs. Toyin Saraki, the wives of the governors of Kebbi and Kogi States, wives of the Service Chiefs as well as a former Deputy Governor of Plateau State, Mrs. Pauline Tallen.
