Then you can go home and you can access it without having to have wi-fi at home.\"\nNo more late fees The service was introduced in January, and so far about 150 Sudburians have signed up. Although the library has offered e-books to borrow for a few years, Hoopla also includes comics, music and movies. And it offers many more copies of the same title.\nAnd since the media is digital, users won't have to scamper back to the book return on time.\n\"You do have a set time to bring back the materials that you download from Hoopla,\" Watts said, But there is no accruement of fines. So once that period of time is over, the title is take off automatically from the device or from your computer, or out of your account. So there is no chance of you ringing up the fine.\"\nThe library has budgeted for the costs of licensing the media, and currently patrons can borrow up to eight titles per month.\nTo sign up for Hoopla, click here", "external_links": ["https://www.hoopladigital.com/browse/ebook/popular"], "published": "2017-02-22T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:38:12.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
