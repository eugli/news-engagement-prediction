Inviting animated visualizations and prosaic props (like apples and colorful Lego plastic blocks) defined him as a funky philosopher rather than a geeky professor. Hans Rosling's 200 Countries, 200 Years, 4 Minutes - The Joy of Stats - BBC Four Video by BBC “I produce a road map for the modern world,” he told The Economist in 2010. “Where people want to drive is up to them. But I have the idea that if they have a proper road map and know what the global realities are, they’ll make better decisions.” In Dr. Rosling’s version of those realities, the traditional divide between third-world and industrialized nations had become anachronistic, since so many countries were undergoing development, with some in Asia improving faster than some in Europe. He considered that five billion people continued to head toward healthier lives while one billion remained mired in poverty and disease; that progress toward health and wealth had contributed to climate change; and that the world was so poorly governed that possibilities to improve it abounded. “I’m not an optimist,” Dr. Rosling once said. “I’m a very serious possibilist.” He predicted that the United Nations’ goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030 was attainable because the tools to do so had been identified and the share of people living in that condition had already declined by more than half in 25 years. He also argued vigorously that overpopulation would no longer be problematic as the world grew wealthier and fertility rates declined. “There are so many who think that death keeps control of population growth,” he said in an interview with The Guardian in 2013. “That’s just wrong!” He told The Economist: “The only way to reach sustainable population levels is to improve public health. Child survival is the new green.” Photo Mr. Rosling in 2015. Credit Henrik Montgomery/TT News Agency, via Reuters As a medical doctor, epidemiologist and academic, but with the flair of a seasoned performer (he once demonstrated his expertise as a sword swallower), he delivered counterintuitive factoids, accused advocates of tweaking statistics to advance their own causes, and debunked misapprehensions about the third world — although not every expert concurred. \n  He pointed out that Sweden had more children per woman than Iran, that Shanghai was just as wealthy and healthy as the Netherlands, and that the world’s average life expectancy of 71 years was now closer to the highest (84 in Japan) than to the lowest (49 in Swaziland). “They just make it about us and them; the West and the rest,” Dr. Rosling told the journal Nature in December. “How could anyone hope to solve problems if they didn’t understand the different challenges faced, for example, by Congolese subsistence farmers far from paved roads and Brazilian street vendors in urban favelas?” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
