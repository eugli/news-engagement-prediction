When Coquelin is absent Arsenal average more goals per game and concede far fewer than when he features. An average of 2.2 goals for and 1.3 goals against jumps to 3 and drops to 0.4 when he does not play. Unfortunately for Arsenal fans, Wenger may have little choice but to play the midfield hex for the foreseeable future. Mohamed Elneny is on international duty, and also an injury doubt for when he returns, while Aaron Ramsey limped off after 20 minutes on Tuesday night with a calf strain.
