I just spoke to kdot. He's really up set about the Queen B not getting her album of the year trophy. \n— Punch TDE (@iamstillpunch) February 13, 2017 Maybe Frank had a point. \n— Punch TDE (@iamstillpunch) February 13, 2017 \nKing Kendrick knows what it’s like to be snubbed by Grammy voters all too well, seeing as how Good Kid mAAD City was upset by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’ The Heist for Best Rap Album in 2014 and Taylor Swift’s 1989 beat out To Pimp A Butterfly for Album Of The Year in 2016. \nPunch even tweeted “Maybe Frank had a point,” referencing the Blonde artist’s recent Tumblr post slamming the Grammy Academy for being out of touch . \nSeveral other artists tweeted their reactions about Beyoncé, including her sister Solange (who shared the same Frank Ocean post), Arcade Fire frontman Win Butler and Diplo. \n— solange knowles (@solangeknowles) February 13, 2017 I love @beyonce I wish that the Grammy voters took a chance on such a personal statement as Lemonade .. but much love to @Adele as always", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:13:36.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
