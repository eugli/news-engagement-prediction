Off-course her approval will be by the majority when it comes to the floor for consideration,” Mr. Ahi told Fiifi Banson on Anopa Kasapa on Kasapa 102.5 FM Wednesday. The MP said they will register their position for the public to know why the nominee was rejected by the minority members on the committee. Gender Minister-designate Otiko Afisa Djaba who faced the vetting committee yesterday was in the news for several controversial issues that popped up at vetting Tuesday. Her refusal to apologise to former President John Dramani Mahama for some “distasteful” comment she made against her prior to the 2016 election is undoubtedly one of the topical issues that might have dimmed her chances to be supported by the NDC minority side on the committee. She’s reported to have upheld her earlier comments that Mr. John Mahama was “Wicked” and an “embarrassment” due to his inability to develop the three Northern country where he comes from.
