Last year, the cost was tallied at £40 million, with each victim losing, on average, £10,000 to scammers. Indeed, Action Fraud believes the true number of cases is much higher as many victims are simply too embarrassed to report the crimes. It is not just a financial cost which devastated victims must pay; the majority are women, who face the agony of rebuilding their confidence following the often humiliating revelation they had become emotionally involved in a romance which did not exist. Most of those falling prey are in their middle years – the average age is 49. Certainly, that feeling of humiliation is something Suzanne Hardman understands only too well. ‘I know now I was an absolute fool,’ she says. ‘I feel so ashamed and embarrassed. I look at the internet messages and I can’t believe how I was taken in. Thanks to my stupidity I’ve thrown away my future.’ Suzanne Hardman (left) lost a huge amount of money to an internet dating conman. Anna Rowe (right) only discovered her long-term boyfriend was actually a married father when she hired a private detective Suzanne, from Hampshire, was reeled in by the profile on Match.com of university educated ‘James Richards’, someone she believed was a prosperous 49-year-old American living in Portsmouth and working in construction. They began exchanging increasingly passionate messages as it became clear how much they had in common. They were both only children and, coincidentally, both had just lost their parents. In one message, he wrote: ‘You make me feel loved. You make me feel safe. But most important of all, you make me feel wanted. ‘Neither of us could begin to imagine the love we both feel, neither exploding nor thundering into our hearts but just slowly growing into a beautiful relationship.’ Suzanne now admits they were ‘a bit gushy’ but adds: ‘Which woman doesn’t like that sometimes?’ He told Suzanne that his late father had £895,567.32 in a frozen account that he couldn’t access. Once that was sorted, they could meet – if Suzanne could transfer the £700 he needed to gain access to the account. Thinking it was a one off, Suzanne sent the money but, won over by his affection, she soon sent additional sums totalling £174,000. The men behind this particular scam were eventually caught and in late 2014 were convicted of fraud – having conned not just Suzanne, but eight other women, too. But most get away with it, according to Neil Masters of the charity Victim Support. Many appear to be part of organised gangs in West Africa or Eastern Europe. They are so successful that even highly intelligent professionals have fallen victim. Lawyer Annemarie Fletcher, 44, found herself duped by a criminal only recently released from prison for defrauding his employer of £50,000. The single mother of two met Kris Lyndsay, who claimed to be a successful businessman, on Tinder, but says that she let her hope of a loving relationship cloud her normally clear judgment. Lyndsay had changed his name to conceal his past, boasted of buying a luxury home and drove a Land Rover which later turned out to be hired. He also claimed to own a water bottling plant, several car parks and a phone app, and so Annemarie was persuaded to meet him within a month in nearby Portishead. A carefully constructed tragedy at the centre of his life only reeled Annemarie in further: he claimed his wife and daughter had been killed by a drunk driver. Within weeks, however, he had asked her for a short term loan, promising in return to pay her daughter’s £15,000 school fees. She handed over £7,000 in borrowed cash and £40,000 of jewellery before the terrible truth emerged. ‘I viewed Kris as an alpha male,’ she says. ‘I ask myself how I was taken in, but I’d never encountered a criminal before and he seemed so plausible. He took me to see a £950,000 house in Somerset that he said he was buying. I even imagined a future living there with him.’ Hospital doctor Liz Todd (left) was manipulated by a serial conman she met on the Plenty Of Fish website. Publicist Amanda Stocks (right) only discovered her ‘perfect’ new partner Matthew was a fraud when her suspicious mother hired a private detective Hospital doctor Liz Todd, 31, found herself manipulated by a serial conman she met on the Plenty Of Fish website – a criminal who spent her cash on strippers and prostitutes. ‘Christopher Smith’ claimed to be a barrister and appeared so charming that Liz fell ‘head over heels’ after just one coffee date. She helped him secure the lease on a manor house apartment after he claimed being self-employed could make things ‘complicated’. But he had reams of paperwork to back up his claims that he enjoyed a six-figure salary, a multi-million-pound rental portfolio and an investment of £300,000 which was set to mature. ‘Smith’ also carried files which suggested he was a barrister, made calls to clients when Liz was there, and had Liz ferry him around to court dates across the North East. But it was when Liz found a newspaper article about him from 2008 that she realised he was a fraud, with 17 different aliases, 133 previous convictions for fraud and a string of jail sentences. He had even been hosting stripper parties at her flat while she worked night shifts. By then, he had quietly fleeced her out of £168,000. His cruel actions left Liz penniless and forced her to sell her home. ‘The thought that I was once in love with him – or the person I thought he was – makes me physically sick,’ she later said. He was later jailed for nine and a half years. Professor Monica Whitty, a cyber-psychologist from Warwick University, points out that intelligence is no protection. ‘The strategies these fraudsters use are highly sophisticated. From the outside, it’s difficult to see how anyone can be taken in, but from the inside, the techniques are incredibly hard to resist.’ In her 2008 book Truth, Lies And Trust On The Internet, Prof Whitty explains that online romances can be ‘hyper-personal – more strong and intimate than physical relationships’. Older people are hardest hit because, she says, there’s evidence that the ability to detect deception declines with age. Certain personality types, more common among women, are particularly vulnerable – those who are romantics and risk-takers, believers in fate and destiny. Lawyer Annemarie Fletcher (pictured) was duped by a criminal only recently released from prison for defrauding his employer of £50,000 Susan Tollefsen would certainly describe herself as the latter. She lost nearly £160,000 after African fraudsters posed as ‘Glenn Vanslyke’, an Italian diamond dealer whose wife had died of cancer. The retired teacher, 66, who became Britain’s oldest first-time mum after having daughter Freya in 2008 following IVF, was lonely and flattered by Glenn’s attention after they met on Plenty of Fish. He showered her with gifts and flowers, and called her daughter ‘my angel’ during lengthy phone calls. ‘He said he had friends in common with my ex-husband, who was also Italian. We seemed so alike – he was very devoted to his family and sent me pictures of his mother.’ They spoke for hours most days so when, within six months, Glenn confessed he was in financial difficulties Susan did not hesitate to send money. She even borrowed £32,000 from friends, convinced the investment would secure Freya’s future. Glenn had not only promised to buy a neighbour’s property and put it in Freya’s name, but also insisted she would see a healthy return on her money. But her suspicions grew after he failed to turn up to meetings in Brussels, and did not board flights to London which she paid for. ‘I had to sell my house and I’m now renting it back. I’d never go back on these websites now.’ Publicist Amanda Stocks, 47, only discovered her ‘perfect’ new partner Matthew was a fraud when her suspicious mother hired a private detective. The couple met in a Croydon café just a week after first chatting on Match.com. Matthew, 36, who was pleasingly tall and good-looking in person, claimed to be a finance manager for the Princess Royal University Hospital in Farnborough, Kent, who was looking for a serious relationship. ‘He told me he was financially secure and owned a house as well as a flat he once shared with a girlfriend,’ Amanda recalled. ‘He painted the picture of an honest man who was offering security and a future. Basically, he told me everything that I wanted to hear. ‘After the first date he started to woo me in earnest through messages on my Blackberry. He told me how lovely I was, how much he liked me. He was so persuasive that I was reeled in very quickly.’ But without realising it, Amanda was almost entirely footing the bill for the couple’s lifestyle, including meals at Claridge’s and a £10,000 holiday to the Maldives. ‘I didn’t even realise that in the nearly four months we were together I was paying every time we went out. He would either have forgotten his wallet or his cards. ‘I was never introduced to his family or friends. He promised he would but always found an excuse to cancel. That should have been a red flag, but I was so “in love” with the idea of having found the perfect man, that I had left my brains in a box somewhere. Last week, the fiance of children’s author Helen Bailey (pictured together), whose body was found dumped in a cesspit, was jailed for more than 30 years after killing the 51-year-old for her multi-million pound inheritance. The two had met on a Facebook dating group ‘There were clues – he was a manager on a big salary but didn’t have a car. When I asked why he said it was because of a drink driving ban. I suppose I just wanted it all to be real.’ A detective hired by her mother discovered he changed out of his suit after leaving their home every day, and into a care worker’s uniform. The property portfolio simply did not exist. ‘There was grief and anger and bewilderment that I had been so gullible. I was heartbroken. The emotional scars meant that it took four years before I would even think of trusting another man.’ Just last week, teaching assistant Anna Rowe, 44, also revealed how she only discovered her long-term boyfriend was actually a married father when she hired a private detective. Anna, 44, met ‘Anthony Ray’ on Tinder and the pair had enjoyed a 14-month relationship and talked of marrying before she discovered, to her horror, that his name and the photograph he used on the app was fake. A detective found he was really a London-based legal executive who spent weekends with his wife and children in the North. She is determined to make it illegal to pose as someone else online. As she points out: ‘The problem is that legislation is not keeping up with technology.’ Amanda Stocks can only agree. ‘I would never recommend internet dating,’ she concludes, ‘but if you are going that route you should take care. Trust your instincts and don’t get swept away by your dreams.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:06:37.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
