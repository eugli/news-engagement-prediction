Michael ultimately threw the punch that knocked the man out. \nWhen the man hit the ground, he slammed his head on the pavement, causing serious head injuries. \nAs part of the plea deal, Papayans must also complete 80 days of community service and enroll in an anger management course. He must also pay more than $100,000 in restitution. \nHis official sentencing won't take place until 2018 -- and there's always a chance the judge could reject the deal -- but that's unlikely at this point. \nFYI, Papayans is the same guy who got into a bar fight alongside Nick Carter in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:42:49.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
