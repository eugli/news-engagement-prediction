Jóhannesson said his favourite football team was Manchester United and he was “fundamentally opposed” to pineapple on pizzas. \nThe president then went further, saying that if he could, he would ban the tropical fruit as a pizza topping if he could. Understandably, Twitter and half the world’s online media went into overdrive. \nOn Tuesday, a statement in English and Icelandic on his Facebook page titled A Statement on the Pizza Controversy, clarified his stance, saying he liked pineapple just not on his pizzas – and could not stop people who did like putting it on theirs. \n“I do not have the power to make laws which forbid people to put pineapples on their pizza,” Guðni, a former history professor at the University of Iceland, wrote. “I am glad I do not hold such power.” lalammar (@Layla_AlAmmar) February 21, 2017 \nPresidents should “not have unlimited power”, he continued. “I would not want to hold this position if I could pass laws forbidding that which I don’t like. I would not want to live in such a country. For pizzas, I recommend seafood.” \nGuðni, 47, has enjoyed huge popularity since his election last June, buoyed by his decision to refuse a 20% pay rise, donate 10% of his pre-tax salary to charity , and become the first president of any country to march in a Gay Pride parade. \nThe president’s informal style – he has been spotted picking up a takeaway pizza on his way home from the office – has seen his approval rating soar as high as 97%, prompting some foreigners to wonder whether others might not benefit from his approach. Mark Lawrence (@MLawrenceJourno) Iceland's President has said he would ban pineapple on pizza. The type of guy that should be leading us here in the UK \nGuðni’s latest intervention in the great pizza debate, however, appeared to spark further furore on Tuesday after Iceland Magazine pointed out he had used the Icelandic word for fish products, rather than seafood. \nThe controversy was by now big enough to “deserve its own –gate suffix,” the magazine said.
