Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 \nThat’s right. Easy D. \nNo one is exactly sure what Mr Trump was referring to, although there’s a chance it meant “Easy Decision”. \nBut for more than a decade, the term “The D” has been explicitly used in reference to — well — the penis. \nIt was first popularised after American singer R Kelly used it in the 2004 song So Sexy , and has existed in the form of spicy memes and “Netflix and chill” requests ever since. \nWhether Mr Trump is familiar with millennial slang is another question altogether, but that hasn’t done much to quell speculation he was indeed referring to the male appendage. \nPredictably enough, “Easy D” fast began trending globally on Twitter, and the memes haven’t stopped pouring in. When you're on Twitter at 3 AM, waiting for that Easy D. pic.twitter.com/aCGHHzjXnS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:05:41.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
