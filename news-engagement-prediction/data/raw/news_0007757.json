'Persistent pattern' \nSir Michael said Nato also needed to do more to tackle the \"false reality\" being propagated by the Kremlin. \n\"Nato must defend itself as effectively in the cyber sphere as it does in the air, on land, and at sea, so adversaries know there is a price to pay if they use cyber weapons,\" he added. \nThe defence secretary pointed to a \"persistent pattern of behaviour\" by Moscow, highlighting a series of cyber attacks that had been linked to Russia. Image copyright PA \nSuspected Russian attacks included France's TV5Monde broadcaster being taken off in April 2015, and the targeting of Germany's lower house of parliament, he said. \nAnother cyber attack, on Bulgaria in October 2016, was described by the country's president as the \"heaviest\" and most \"intense\" to be conducted in south-eastern Europe. \nSir Michael also spoke of the suspected Russian hacking of the two main political parties in the US presidential elections. Testing Nato \n\"Today, we see a country that in weaponising misinformation has created what we might now see as the post-truth age,\" he said. \n\"Russia is clearly testing Nato and the West. It is seeking to expand its sphere of influence, destabilise countries and weaken the alliance. \n\"It is undermining national security for many allies and the international rules-based system. \n\"Therefore it is in our interest and Europe's to keep Nato strong and to deter and dissuade Russia from this course.\" \nSir Michael backed US president Donald Trump's call for all Nato member states to honour the commitment to spend a minimum of 2% of GDP on defence.
