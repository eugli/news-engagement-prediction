Many OKC fans see Durant as a traitor for leaving to join the team that just beat them in the Western Conference Finals. \nBecause the fans are still upset, there are plenty of shirts being sold that throw shade at Durant and show support for Russell Westbrook, the star who stayed. These shirts are so petty and amazing. \nESPN showed one on air that has \"KOWARD\" on the front - get it, KD, coward, KowarD - and a cupcake on the back. Very subtle.

He didn't judge him. All he did was take a picture. When Kendrick Perkins played center for the Thunder, he called teammates \"cupcake\" if he thought they were acting a little soft. Westbrook and Durant adopted the term in jest. Westbrook posted a bittersweet pic on Instagram: three plates of cupcakes topped by red and blue stars and sprinkles. \nAdditionally, ESPN's Royce Young tweeted out this shirt that remembers that one time Westbrook was asked if he and Durant are on speaking terms and the Thunder guard simply replied, \"Nah.\" Lots of shirts around OKC for KD's return tonight, but this might be the best I've seen, from @blue_7 : pic.twitter.com/tp1jLqcDNh â€” Royce Young (@royceyoung) February 11, 2017 \nThere are LOTS of other shirts out there, though, that can be easily found, such as these (and many variations of these): OKC shirts are lit pic.twitter.com/6Qo9W15mgO", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:21:51.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
