It will now move to the state Senate. \nBill 638 was proposed due to a shortage of the drugs necessary for lethal injection, meaning no executions have been carried out in Mississippi since 2012, despite 47 prisoners being on death row. \nThe alternative drugs the state plans to use have caused wide concern and the state government faces several lawsuits on the grounds that they would violate the eighth amendment of the Constitution limiting cruel and unusual punishment.
