Chris Christie has a shot. \nWhile all signs pointed to Christie pursuing a career in sports talk radio when his run as New Jersey Governor came to an end at the end of 2017, a Wednesday report from NorthJersey.com lends credence to WFAN's interest in him--not just the other way around. \n\"I would certainly at least want to consider him,\" WFAN program director Mark Chernoff said. \"If he's interested and we're interested, it's worth pursuing.\" \nIn recent months, Christie has frequently appeared as a fill-in on WFAN's morning show, Boomer and Carton, but hasn't been part of any other day part. With the typical show tenor different between what WFAN's morning and afternoon shows are like, Christie could be in line to net some afternoon fill-in shows this coming summer. \nChernoff said that an opportunity would be there to sit in Francesa's chair during his vacation time--if Christie had the time. \n\"We'll probably let him do some afternoon shows,\" Chernoff said. \nChristie was one of the most-talked about figures in sports media last week after critical comments made about the Phillies fan base. \nFrancesa is set to depart WFAN in December 2017. He's been part of drive-time on the station since 1989. Much of that run came alongside Chris \"Mad Dog\" Russo, but Francesa has been a solo host since 2008. \nJoe Giglio may be reached at .
