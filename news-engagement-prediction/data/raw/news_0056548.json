I’ve had walking home, people coming up behind me.” \nDuring filming, one man was caught taking photographs of her from behind in the street but refused to apologise when he was confronted and insisted what he was doing was fine.

I’ve had it before on the tube where people are slyly taking photos, just unbelievable.

I felt quite violated by it.” \nWatching the footage, former Nottinghamshire Police chief constable Sue Fish says: “Without doubt, in this circumstance it’s sexual harassment. So we would record them as a crime and additionally as a hate crime. \n\"Any other force has a duty to that victim to record them as a crime. So it doesn’t matter whether they’re in London, whether they’re in Newcastle, whether they’re in Birmingham, or Nottingham, or any other city for that matter, they should be reporting them to their local police for them to take action. It’s completely unacceptable.” He seems to be shooting from the hip and taking pictures of her from behind (Photo: ITV) \nITV's Tonight programme also polled 2,000 women aged between 18 and 34 and found half of the women in Britain say they have been sexually harassed in public. \nA total of 29 per cent of those surveyed had been verbally sexually harassed in the street, while 18 per cent say they had been both physically and verbally harassed. \nIt also found that 56 per cent of respondents say they had been physically or verbally sexually harassed - or both - by a stranger in a bar or club, but only 10 per cent say they had made a complaint about the behaviour.

It’s completely unacceptable.” \nRachel Krys of the End Violence Against Women Coalition says: “Sexual harassment is not a come on, it’s not a precursor to a relationship, it’s about men controlling what women do and wanting to stop women being free to walk down the streets, to just take the space that they’re entitled to.
