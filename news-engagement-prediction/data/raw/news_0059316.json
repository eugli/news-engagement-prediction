He has reportedly said the gold is used by his fund as a hedge against inflation. \nCheryl, with whom David has three children, is an award-winning financial reporter and media consultant who has also taught at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and Columbia Business School. \nShe is also credited with coming up with the name “Greenlight” when he launched his fund in 1996. \nThe couple is well-known in New York for their philanthropic work. In 2002, they established the Einhorn Family Charitable Trust, “with the vision of building a more peaceful and harmonious society,” according to its Web site, which features numerous photos of Cheryl and David. \nHe also serves on the boards of City Year, the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, and as chair of the Robin Hood Foundation’s board of directors. \nA spokesman for David Einhorn declined to comment on Wednesday night, and Cheryl didn’t return calls and e-mail requests for comment. \nCitadel billionaire Ken Griffin settled his bitter divorce with now-ex Anne Dias-Griffin in 2015. And David Tepper, one of the world’s highest-earning fund managers, split with his wife of almost 30 years in 2014 .
