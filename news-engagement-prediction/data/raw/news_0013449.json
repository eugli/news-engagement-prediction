I don't regret killing my mother, and as evil as that may sound, that's my reality. ... But I regret bringing Tommy into it. I regret being selfish. I regret trapping an innocent person into this, because it was my battle, it was my mother, it was my father.\" \nMack also says on the video that she forced Schaefer to help clean the room and hide the body by threatening to tell authorities he was the killer and paying to have him arrested; she adds that she persuaded him to take the blame in court to avoid the death penalty, in the hope that she could go free and keep a sizable trust fund. She professes her love for him and says the only way he took part in the crime was hiding the body. \n\"So he lied in the court because of me,\" she says in the videos. \"My motivation for doing this was for myself. It's from inside of me, and it's my battle. It wasn't Tommy's. Tommy's an innocent man.\" \nSchaefer, formerly of Oak Park, is serving an 18-year prison term. He testified during his trial that von Wiese-Mack became angry when he came to her hotel room to tell her that Mack was pregnant. He testified that he struck her with a heavy metal fruit bowl handle but only after she made a racial slur, threatened to harm the unborn baby and then began strangling him. \nBut emails obtained by the Tribune show that von Wiese-Mack knew about her daughter's pregnancy even before leaving for vacation. Mack gave birth to a healthy girl named Stella in March 2015 and is raising her in prison, per local custom, until the child is 2 years old next month. \nMack and Schaefer broke up in 2016, according to their social media posts. \nAs the criminal proceedings surrounding the murder played out in Indonesia, a battle over Mack's $1.56 million trust continued in Chicago. Mack's uncle, the trustee, argues that Mack should be barred from reaping financial benefit from her crime under Illinois' slayer statute, which states that a person who unjustifiably causes the death of another person cannot receive property as a result of that death. \nMack's daughter is next in line for the money. \nIn written correspondence to a Cook County judge presiding over her trust case, Mack said that \"with all due respect\" to her slain mother, she believes von Wiese-Mack lied and falsified court documents years earlier to gain control over a more substantial inheritance the daughter was due from her father's estate. \nMack gave the Tribune in late 2015 a copy of the eight-page letter to the judge and a separate written list of \"non-negotiable settlement\" terms. In her writings, as well as during a telephone interview, Mack said she didn't want to criticize her mother publicly but she has little other option after her trust lawyers have refused to investigate her claims. \n\"My worry is there are still assets out there somewhere ... i.e. property, stocks, and shares which are rightfully mine,\" Mack wrote. \nHeather Mack attended Oak Park and River Forest High School. According to acquaintances, von Wiese-Mack had a volatile relationship with her daughter when Heather was a teen. She told friends she could not control her. She sold the family's Oak Park home for $650,000 and moved to an apartment on Lake Shore Drive in an attempt to give her and her daughter a fresh start, acquaintances said. \nChicago Tribune's Christy Gutowski contributed. \nTwitter @angie_leventis", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:13:38.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
