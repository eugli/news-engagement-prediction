The actress is all set to grace the big screen in “Rangoon” opposite Shahid Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan . People have high hopes from the 29-year-old and are expecting her to set the silver screen ablaze with her performance, just as she did in “Queen” and “Tanu Weds Manu Returns”. \nWATCH | Consider Myself Lucky To Have Worked With Saif, Shahid In ‘Rangoon’: Kangana \nWith promotional events on in full-swing, Ranaut recently made an appearance on “Koffee With Karan”. Her cheeky one-liners and potshots at Johar on his talk show have been the talk of the town. But that’s not all! From western oomph to the traditional finesse — she has been grabbing eyeballs for each and every look since the last few days and to be honest, we loved her flair. \nALSO READ | Looks like Kangana Ranaut has started a love affair with saris and we aren’t complaining \nHere are our favourite looks: \nBackless basics: Ranaut called for a lot of attention when she graced a chic look in Fendi separates from the SS17 collection and Tom Ford pumps. Styled by Ami Patel, she was a vision in her stripy cotton jacket with a cut-out back. Most of all, we love how she looks so cool without any accessories or jewellery. Kangana Ranaut in Fendi.

With the bust in black and white and a touch of red on the waistline, we think the midi dress is a perfect fit on her.

Looking every bit gorgeous, she accessorised the number with a black choker and black pumps. Smokey eyes and nude make-up rounded her look. Kangana Ranaut in Emanuel Ungaro.

We think the actress perfectly complemented the look with strappy stilettos and wavy tresses. Kangana Ranaut at Mehboob Studios.

Showing off her fiesty side, she added to the look with a hat and mask. Kangana Ranaut at the Bloody Hell cocktail launch.
