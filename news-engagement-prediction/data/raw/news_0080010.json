Headstones are a source of not only dates of birth and death, but possibly maiden names, occupation, military service or fraternal association. Sometimes members of the extended family may be buried nearby. Tiny grave markers can tell the story of children who died in infancy for whom no other records exist. Flowers left on a grave may even possibly lead you to living descendants! \nWhen researching Irish cemeteries and the people buried in them, there are two major types of records that can often be helpful—headstone transcriptions and burial registers. Headstone transcriptions , and sometimes accompanying photographs, capture the information recorded on the individual grave markers. Transcriptions only reflect the information that was still legible at the time the transcription was made, however, and may not reflect gravestone engravings that have worn away with time, or headstones that have been lost or damaged. It is also possible that a grave marker was never erected, either due to finances or lack of surviving relatives in the area. Burial registers , maintained by the individual cemetery, church, or city or county council, may include additional information such as the last residence of the deceased, who paid for the burial, and the names of other individuals buried in the grave. Because these records were made at the time of burial, they often include individuals for whom grave markers may no longer exist. \nThis list of online Ireland cemetery records covers cemeteries in both Ireland and Northern Ireland, and includes headstone inscriptions, cemetery photos and burial registers.
