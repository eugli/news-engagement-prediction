Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA footballer believed a 14-year-old girl was above the age of consent when she sent him a topless selfie and met him in his car outside his club's football ground - a court has heard. \nJack Tuohy, 20, is alleged to have groomed the girl before she allegedly performed a sex act on him in his Seat Ibiza at a secluded spot in Oldham, Greater Manchester. \nTouhy - who was 19 and played for Oldham Athletic at the time of the alleged offences - denies the charges against him and claims he believed the girl was at least 16. \nPaul Hodgkinson, defending Tuohy, put it to the girl that it was she rather than his client who initiated contact shortly after he handed out medals at her school's sports day. \nManchester Minshull Street Crown Court heard the complainant had \"liked\" a number of photographs of the defendant which he posted on social media before the sports day - one dating back to 2013. Jack Tuohy denies all the charges (Photo: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd) \nGiving evidence via videolink, the girl accepted she had liked the photographs but said that did not necessarily mean she did so before the tournament. \nMr Hodgkinson said: \"I am saying you knew who Jack Tuohy was before you met him at the football. In fact you had followed him ... and you liked a number of his photographs.\" \nThe girl replied: \"No, I didn't know who he was.\" \nProsecutors claim Tuohy went on to groom the youngster, who sent him a topless selfie photograph, through social media before she performed a sex act on him in his Seat Ibiza car parked in a secluded location in Oldham. \nOpening the case, prosecutor Ben Jones had said the evidence would show the defendant \"effectively bullied\" the \"starstruck\" teenager into meeting up after she developed a crush on him. \nOn Wednesday, the girl told the jury that she recalled telling the footballer on Snapchat that she was 14.

Stop messing me around you coming or not. Can't I just drive to near your house? Surely you know one place where no one goes? \nGirl: ''No I'm not allowed I will get grounded. I don't really meet lads in cars I'm not sure. I've met you before.'' \nTuohy: ''Are you coming or not?'' \nGirl: ''This is my only chance isn't it? I don't want to do stuff if we just met.'' \nTuohy: ''Wow so you're all talk wow. Don't speak to me again you're all talk.'' \nGirl: ''What would you want to do. I would do some stuff. S*ck you off. Probs. If you want.'' \nTuohy: ''Best not tell one person. I'll wear something easy to get into like joggers haha. You better not back out. Just be confident. But tell no one. Just get in and just start feeling my d*** it will be fine. It will make you feel comfortable just start rubbing it on top of my pants and then go down while I drive.'' \nTuohy, 20, of Arthur Street, Shaw, Oldham, denies two counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child, two counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of meeting a child following sexual grooming.
