Slot to Philadelphia Links \nThe Philadelphia Eagles are set to invest all their available salary cap space this offseason on free agent wide receivers and draft picks. \nNFL.com's Gregg Rosenthal believes the Eagles should spend their money elsewhere, on a another position the franchise desperately needs to revamp. \nRosenthal lists the Eagles should sign Trumaine Johnson in free agency, one of the top cornerbacks available on the market next month. \n\"All of the talk about wide receiver in Philadelphia makes sense, but the team's need at cornerback is nearly as desperate,\" Rosenthal wrote . \"One year after bringing in former Rams safety Rodney McLeod , it would be worth it for the Eagles to check out Johnson's price tag. It's hard to imagine Los Angeles using the franchise tag on Johnson again for the price of $16.74 million.\" \nThe Philadelphia Eagles have a crucial offseason ahead of them as the franchise looks to return to the playoffs for the first time since 2013.

Opposing cornerbacks were hesitant to throw Johnson's way after he had seven interceptions and 17 pass deflections the year before. \nWith Janoris Jenkins leaving the Rams to sign with the New York Giants in free agency, Johnson became the No. 1 corner on a Rams secondary that allowed just 233.3 passing yards in 2016. Johnson earned a Pro Football Focus grade of 81.0, which was ranked 26th out of 112 cornerbacks. \nJohnson's market value is listed at $12.4 million per season. The 27 year-old is expected to receive a four-year, $49.6 million deal in free agency, as multiple teams will be bidding for his services. \nSigning Johnson would immediately improve the Eagles at cornerback and provide them with a No. 1 option at the position, but the Eagles have invested their money before giving big contracts to free agent cornerbacks Nmandi Asomugha and Byron Maxwell , with both providing disastrous results. Five moves Eagles should make this offseason Start SlideShow \nEven with a better defensive coordinator in Jim Schwartz , the Eagles are highly unlikely to pursue a high-priced free agent cornerback again. With a deep cornerback pool in this year's draft, the Eagles are likely to use multiple picks to improve the position there.
