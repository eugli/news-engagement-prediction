The entry-level amp supports both DAB and DAB+ standards, so should be futureproofed. \nOther than that, it's pretty much identical to its predecessor. But considering the original amp earned four out of five stars in our review, that's no bad thing. \nIt supports Ultra HD, HDR, and HDCP 2.2 video pass-through for all your entertainment needs. Bluetooth also comes as standard, for wireless streaming from a phone or tablet. \nThe 5.1 channel receiver packs 130W of power per channel, and supports Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio surround sound on Blu-ray discs. The result? Films will sound exactly as the sound engineer intended. More after the break \nThe device is aimed at home cinema enthusiasts looking to take a step up from a soundbar . \nThe VSX-531D is available now, priced Â£350.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:06:57.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
