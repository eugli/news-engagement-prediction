Takedown, The Insider , and Collateral . \nLast year, Nolan hosted a reunion screening of Heat , which centers on a gang of criminals led by Robert De Niro, who are pursued be police led by Al Pacino. \nCheck out the comparison below, as well as part of Nolan's Q&A with Mann, Pacino and De Niro.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:59:48.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
