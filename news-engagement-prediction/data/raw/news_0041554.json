(tillsonburg/Getty Images)  27 PM \nMaybe he wanted to see what it felt like to be on the right side of the law. \nPolice arrested a 27-year-old man with an extensive criminal record for impersonating a cop in Harlem — after he was caught doling out warnings to turnstile jumpers, officials said. \nJonathan Cabrera, of the Bronx, was nabbed inside the 2 and 3 train 125th St. station about 4 p.m. on Wednesday wearing a silver-and-blue police shield around his neck on a chain, according to cops. \nHe was stopping turnstile jumpers, checking their IDs and threatening to give them a summons, officials said. \nA plainclothes transit cop watched Cabrera identify himself as a police officer. That’s when the cop pulled out his own — very real — badge and arrested Cabrera, officials said. \nCabrera was charged with criminal impersonation and possession of marijuana. \nHe was ordered held on $1,500 bail, officials said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:41:41.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
