JONATHAN LEASK/FAIRFAX NZ \nPeople swimming in the lake early last year. \nThe Waimakariri District Council said the lake was closed until further notice. \nREAD MORE * North Canterbury's Lake Pegasus closed due to possible algae bloom \nCanterbury medical officer of health Dr Ramon Pink said the blue-green algae (planktonic cyanobacteria) produce a dangerous toxin. \n\"People and animals, particularly dogs, should avoid contact with Lake Pegasus until the health warning has been lifted. \n\"Exposure may cause skin rashes, nausea, stomach cramps, tingling and numbness around the mouth and fingertips. If you experience any of these symptoms visit your doctor immediately and please let them know you have had contact with the lake water.\" \nThe health of the lake has been a sore point in the community. \nThe lake's resource consent, issued in 2006, requires it only be kept to a secondary contact standard. Ad Feedback \nAt the time, hearing commissioners said it was unlikely to maintain a swimmable standard. \nDespite not being designed for swimming, the lake has beaches and hosts events such as triathlons which involve people swimming in the lake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:59:55.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
