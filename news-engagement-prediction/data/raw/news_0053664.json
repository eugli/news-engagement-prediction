Profile: Who is Marine Le Pen? In an interview with CNN earlier this month, she described the issue as a \"political attack.\" \"It's inadmissible. We have been persecuted by the EU Parliament. They are our adversaries,\" she said, adding that she had filed a complaint against the European Anti-Fraud Office. Le Pen is fiercely Euroskeptic, and has promised to hold a referendum on France leaving the European Union if she is elected president. The Front National leader is not the only French presidential candidate caught up in a financial scandal. Republican party contender François Fillon has been accused of paying his wife and children for work they did not do. Fillon has rejected the claims and refused to stand down, insisting he has \"nothing to hide.\" CNN's Stephanie Halasz in London contributed to this story.
