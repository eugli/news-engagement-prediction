He was spotted at Union Square Donuts in Somerville Thursday morning.\nIn the midst of Boston’s memorably miserable snowmageddon of 2015, the Boston Yeti first appeared as a tall, furry figure who wandered the streets and occasionally shoveled snow for winter-weary Bostonians. Residents credited him with keeping the public semi-sane during the frustration caused by that merciless barrage of snowstorms.\nAdvertisement\nThe Boston Yeti — social media-savvy as far as Himalayan creatures go, with more than 8,000 Twitter followers — stopped by the popular doughnut shop Thursday morning and posed for selfies.\nDonuts and snowstorms go so well together! @UnionSqDonuts @BostInno @BostonTweet #bosnow #snowday #snowstorm2017 #bostonyeti pic.twitter.com/ZRsBHfeOWA\n— Boston Yeti 2015 (@BostonYeti2015) February 9, 2017 Swing by the somerville shop for some pre-blizzard donuts with @BostonYeti2015 pic.twitter.com/CqOPoxTnvJ\n— Union Square Donuts (@UnionSqDonuts) February 9, 2017 My first yeti selfie!! @BostonYeti2015 @UnionSqDonuts pic.twitter.com/TEmc520Xdn\n— Gary Vogel (@GVogel18) February 9, 2017 The Boston Yeti also tweeted a photo of himself holding a sign that reads, “Good is coming.”\nBoston!
