Kim eldest son 'opposes dynasty' Bypassed for succession \nIn 2001, Mr Kim was caught trying to enter Japan using a false passport. He told officials that he was planning to visit Tokyo Disneyland. \nOnce seen as a likely successor to Kim Jong-il, he was thought to have fallen out of favour with his father over the incident. \nBypassed in favour of his youngest half-brother for succession when their father died in 2011, Kim Jong-nam kept a low profile, spending most of his time overseas in Macau, Singapore and China. \nHe was quoted by Japanese media in 2011 as saying he opposed \"dynastic succession\". \nHe was also quoted in a 2012 book as saying he believed his younger half-brother lacked leadership qualities, the succession would not work and that North Korea was unstable and needed Chinese-style economic reform. \nMr Kim was reportedly targeted for assassination in the past. A North Korean spy jailed by South Korea in 2012 was reported to have admitted trying to organise a hit-and-run accident targeting him.
