It seems like the franchise is about to crack. \nThe Joey Porter case is a litmus test of the Steelers’ pride, priorities and common sense. For Coach Mike Tomlin, it’s even more so. \nIf you need to catch up, click HERE to read about the shenanigans of Porter and Tomlin at North Catholic High School football games. Porter was clearly a much bigger problem than Tomlin. \nBut everything written about Porter has been confirmed by the police, opposing schools, etc. Even if Tomlin only acted up marginally, he was still there. Porter is his assistant coach. Tomlin did nothing to stop Porter despite how it was going to reflect on him and the Steelers. \nThere is no logical reason to not fire Porter. But Steelers president Art Rooney II says the decision is Tomlin’s. \nTomlin put Porter back on the sideline just a week after he was arrested at a South Side bar, partying with players. He stood idly by while Porter ran on the field to accost a referee at a high school football game. Tomlin obviously won’t fire Porter. Tomlin is Porter’s buddy, not his boss. \nWhere is the accountability? Where is the dignity? This isn’t a late hit on the football field, it’s a pattern of bad behavior in the community by a marginal member of the organization. \nThe Steelers might as well be the Cincinnati Bengals. It won’t get better. It will get worse. Mark Madden - The Super Genius of Pittsburgh Sports.
