You do not have access to view this Atom. \nNearly 850 new homes, comprising studio, one, two, three and four-bedroom houses, will be built with 18 buildings in total sitting on the site - ranging in height from three to 13-storeys. \nAs well as new homes, the site will also have shops, a library and cycle routes while West Ham's rich history in the area will be commemorated with a 'legacy route', which will include sculptures of legendary football figures. Randolph's journey from Motherwell's bench to first choice at West Ham \nTo add, the centre circle of the Boleyn Ground pitch will be preserved in a landscaped courtyard while the half-way line will be illuminated through the use of in-laid lighting. \nSpeaking about Upton Gardens, Barratt London sales director Pam Reardon said: \"A great deal of thought has gone into the design of Upton Gardens to ensure the legacy of the site, with its historical significance and importance to West Ham Football Club, is preserved.
