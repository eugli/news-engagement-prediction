Aussie produce a hit on e-commerce giant Alibaba Photo: During the shopping frenzy known as Singles Day last year Alibaba did a staggering US$17.79 billion in sales in 24 hours. (ABC News) \nThe delegation visited beef importers, freight handlers, ports and e-commerce operations including online juggernaut Alibaba. \nAlibaba has cornered 75 per cent of China's e-commerce trade, and 1,300 Australian businesses already use it to sell beef, fresh milk, honey, nuts, infant formula and vitamins. \n\"It was mind-boggling, the figures on that screen were just mind-boggling,\" said Queensland orchardist Rosie Savio after the Alibaba tour. \n\"I didn't realise that there was such an e-commerce business anywhere in the world.\" \nDemand for Australian produce was clear at online food e-tailer G-shop which imports Australian oysters, wagyu beef and fresh milk. \nIn one day G-shop sold 16 tonnes of Australian single serve steaks through Alibaba. \nAustrade's Henry Wang told delegates they needed to understand the extraordinary rise of online, or e-commerce in China. \n\"This is really a game changer, in the last year 413 million online consumers spent more than $750 billion online alone,\" he said. \nIn the click and share country, where phones are in hand all the time, social media drives buying decisions. \n\"In the future all commerce will be social,\" China-based PR consultant Darren Burns told delegates. \nIn fact Queensland nut producer Stahmann Farms has been exporting to China for 18 months and found because many Chinese consumers do not buy food from a physical bricks and mortar shop, they needed to develop an online site and hire a social media staffer to upload content to China's equivalent of Facebook and Twitter — WeChat and Weibo. \n\"Social media consumption in China is incredible, they don't buy anything unless they have done some form of research and that research is two and three second bites back into their own social media network or a network they trust,\" said sales manager Andrew Waddell. Photo: Inside the G-Shop store — Australian beef is its core product. (ABC News) Fruit and vegetables still still locked out \nHowever, despite the ChAFTA breakthrough several farmers on the trip were frustrated as their produce cannot be exported to China. \nQueensland vegetable grower Richard Gorman said the Federal Government was not doing enough to get more fruits and vegetables ticked off. \n\"Cherries, citrus, beef, fresh milk they're all in there but for us in the world of vegetables we can't actually send anything fresh there at the moment, so we need our political leaders to ask for it,\" he said. \n\"The trade deal's there and they've done a great job, now it's about making sure we've got the protocols that allow us to actually trade. \n\"There's 200 Australians standing behind me that all paid their own way to be here, and the people of the political landscape at home need to see that, it's going to come down to our political leaders they're going to make this opportunity happen or not.\" More Window on China stories:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:07:45.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
