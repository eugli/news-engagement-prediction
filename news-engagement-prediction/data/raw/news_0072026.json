He died last Friday, aged 71, at a care home in Kent.\nSir Nicholas was a distinguished and compassionate judge whose career as president of the family division was brought to a premature end by illness in December 2012 after two years in charge.\nThe death notice records that he “died by his own hand on 17th February 2017 aged 71”. He is survived by his wife Margaret, his children, Imogen, Emma, Rosalind and Simon, and grandsons Joshua and Arthur. The notice adds: “After years of suffering, he was recently diagnosed with a rare dementia of the fronto-temporal lobe.”\nThe notice includes the opening of a poem, Tithonus by Tennyson, which begins:\n“The woods decay, the woods decay and fall,\nThe vapours weep their burthen to the ground,\nMan comes and tills the field and lies beneath,\nAnd after many a summer dies the swan.”\nIn legend, Tithonus was a Trojan granted immortality but not eternal youth and realises he no longer wishes to live forever. Sir Nicholas’s family asked for any donations to be made to the National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery.\nSir James Munby, who succeeded Sir Nicholas as president of the family division, paid tribute to his work. “On and off the bench and to the wide admiration of those who practise in family law, Sir Nicholas often spoke with passion, and in plain language, about the importance of family life, the good practice of family law, and the proper administration and resourcing of family justice.\n“He was appropriately outspoken about the plight of children caught up in the midst of parental conflict. He expressed his deep concern again and again about the impact of domestic abuse on children and on family life.\n“Sir Nicholas’s life was one of very great achievement and he has left us a formidable and enduring legacy.”\nThe Family Law Bar Association (FLBA) described him as “a compassionate judge who thought and cared deeply about the outcome of his cases”.\nIn his time in the family division, Sir Nicholas championed many progressive causes including the rights of unmarried couples, the introduction of no-fault divorces and supported increased transparency for courts .\nWhen he retired, Nicholas Cusworth QC, chair of the FLBA, said: “Sir Nicholas Wall has been the most distinguished family lawyer of his generation. He was equally at home with cases involving money and children at the bar, a very rare commodity. As a judge, he was brave in asserting what he saw as the right way, especially where the interests of children were concerned.\n“He was trusted to stand up for the fair administration of family justice against the repeated attempts at cost cutting by successive governments.”\nSir Nicholas, who qualified as a barrister in 1969, became a judge in 1990. He worked in the employment appeal tribunal, the administrative court and the court of appeal, as well as the family division.\nIn the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.\nIn the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.\nIn Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.
