Within weeks, two more letters arrived in which the writer asked the names of the children and said he would call them to him. \nInstead of moving in, the couple tried selling the house, but said they found potential buyers scared off by the letters. In June 2015, the couple sued the prior owners, claiming they had also received a letter from the stalker days before the sale but never disclosed it. The lawsuit was so widely reported that the prior owners, John and Andrea Woods, counter sued , claiming they had been damaged by all the attention. \nUnable to move in or sell the house, the Broadduses last year filed an application with the township to demolish the house, subdivide the property and build two new homes. After a public outcry that small lots would be out of character with the neighborhood, the township planning board in January rejected the application for the subdvision. \nLee Levitt, the Broadduses' attorney in their suit against the prior owners, confirmed that the couple is now leasing the home. Levitt declined to comment further arrangement. \nLevitt said the suit against the prior owners - and their counter suit - are still pending in court. \nTom Haydon may be reached at .
