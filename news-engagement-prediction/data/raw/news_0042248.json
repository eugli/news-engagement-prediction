DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nAs a reminder, President Donald Trump vowed to make cyber security a priority during his administration, stating at a White House event last month that, he would \n\"...hold my Cabinet secretaries and agency heads accountable, totally accountable, for the cyber security of their organizations.\" \nFurthermore, Trump had planned to sign a cyber security executive order last month but it was put on hold to allow more time for review .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:58:47.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
