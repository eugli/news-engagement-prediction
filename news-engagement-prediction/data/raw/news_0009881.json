often fruitlessly.\nLast week a damning report by the Public Accounts Committee warned that the Department of Health was failing to recover hundreds of millions of pounds, amid “chaotic” cost recovery systems.\nMr Hunt said: \"We have no problem with overseas visitors using our NHS - as long as they make a fair contribution, just as the British taxpayer does.\n\"So today we are announcing plans to change the law which means those who aren't eligible for free care will be asked to pay upfront for non-urgent treatment.\n\"We aim to recover up to £500 million a year by the middle of this Parliament - money that can then be reinvested in patient care.\"\nIt will be up to individual NHS trusts to work out whether they take a payment there and then - or allow patients to sign a form to agree to a longer-term payment plan.\nSome trusts will check eligibility through asking people to produce two forms of identification - such as a passport and a utility bill with a UK address.\nPatients will be told upfront that their care is chargeable before treatment begins.\nUnder the plans, anyone from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who is staying in the UK for longer than six months will also not be eligible for free fertility treatment on the NHS.\nThose needing urgent care will still be treated immediately on the NHS.\nSuch patients will still be invoiced later if they are found not to be eligible for free care.\nThe task force well help staff patients ineligible for free care Credit: AFP L ast week, a BBC documentary Hospital, featured overseas patients who are unable to pay their medical bills.\nOne Nigerian mother, Priscilla, who gave birth to quadruplets, two of whom died, now owes the NHS nearly £500,000.\nUnder the new plans, she would still have received urgent treatment as her life and those of her babies were at risk.\nPeterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is piloting a scheme where patients have to show two forms of identification - such as a passport or birth certificate and a utility bill - for non-urgent care.\nThe trust said it had recouped £350,000 a year sinec introducing the changes, investing funds back into the sytsem to benefit patients.\nHealth officials said the charges did not appear to have deterred those in need of treatment, with little change to the numbers not attending appointments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:08:52.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
