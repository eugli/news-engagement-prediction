It was sad in one way, because I've loved the honour and prestige of all of it.\"\nCook's captaincy career included several notable achievements, including making three hundreds as he led England to their first series win in India in 28 years during his first series as full-time skipper in 2012.\nEngland's leading scorer in Tests with 11,057 runs, Cook also oversaw last year's triumph in South Africa as well as home Ashes campaign wins in 2013 and 2015.\nBut in between those Ashes successes came a chastening 5-0 series whitewash in Australia in 2013/14 and the fall-out from the effective sacking of star batsman Kevin Pietersen that followed.\nAlthough he was far from alone in making the decision, it was Cook who was the public face of a move that left him in the firing line during a 2014 home season that started with a shock series defeat by Sri Lanka.\n\"I think we all have regrets over how it was handled,\" Essex left-hander Cook said of Pietersen's departure from the England scene.\n\"I was part of that decision, I wasn't the be-all-and-end-all of it, but what followed was part of the responsibility I had as England captain.\n\"The fallout wasn't great for English cricket, we were in the headlines for the wrong reasons.\"\nCook, however, said his morale had received a huge boost when, following England's defeat against India at Lord's in the second Test of the 2014 series, he was cheered at Southampton before making 95 on the first day of the third Test.\nEngland won that match and eventually took the series 3-1.\n\"I'll never forget Southampton, the warmth I had there in 2014,\" Cook said.\n\"That kept me going, and of course my family and friends who mean the world to me and stuck with me through the tough times.\"\nEngland's next Test is not until their July 6 opener at home to South Africa.\nThey also have a home series against the West Indies before heading off on an Ashes tour of Australia.\nAsked if he had any tips for his successor, with current vice-captain Joe Root the favourite to take over, Cook said he should use the advice of those around him.\n\"There are a lot of great people out there who watch a lot of cricket who know probably more than you do. So use that advice and be open to it.\n\"Ultimately you have to make the decision out there yourself, but use as much as you can.\"\nHe added: \"I look forward to the next part of my career, supporting the next guy as best I can, and hopefully scoring some runs as well and being part of England's success.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:56:53.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
