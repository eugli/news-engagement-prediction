He took his winning shot, \"Dancing Octopus,\" off Mayotte Island in July 2016. \nWrote one judge of the image, which beat out 4,500 photos taken by photographers from 67 countries, \"Both balletic and malevolent, this image shows that the octopus means business as it hunts in a shallow lagoon. The way it moves is so different from any predator on land, this truly could be an alien from another world.\" Photo by: Gabriel Barathieu/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Out of the blue \nNick Blake won the British Underwater Photographer of the Year honor for 2017, capturing this image, \"Out of the Blue,\" in the waters off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula in December of 2016. \n\"I left my strobes behind for the natural light shot I wanted and positioned myself in the shadows of the cavern,\" Blake said. \"Moving my eye around the viewfinder, I could see that the rock outline of the cavern around me made for a pleasing symmetry and I adjusted my position to balance the frame. The light show flickered on and off as the sun was periodically covered by cloud and as it reappeared, I beckoned to my buddy and dive guide, Andrea Costanza of ProDive, to edge into the illumination of some of the stronger beams, completing the composition.\" Photo by: Nick Blake//UPY2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Oceanic in the sky \nHoracio Martinez of Argentina won the Up & Coming Underwater Photographer of the Year. He took this image, \"Oceanic in the Sky,\" in Egypt's Red Sea in April 2016. \n\"We were on the last dive of the day and I ventured a tad deeper to get closer portraits of the Oceanic White Tips, when I noticed this shark patrolling in the distance,\" Martinez said. \"I took a few shots to expose for the sun beams and the surface, and was pleased by the dreamlike effect. Oceanics are great subjects for close ups as they are anything but shy. Yet, every now and then it is great to try and capture their apparent loneliness, their wandering, and their independence in the big blue.\" Photo by: Horacio Martinez/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Orca pod \nNicholai Georgiou was named Most Promising British Underwater Photographer 2017, with help from this image taken in November 2016 off Norway. \n\"Orcas are easily the most beautiful, intelligent and confident animals I've ever had the honor of spending time with,\" Georgiou said. \"This photo was taken during an amazing week free-diving with wild Orca in Norway. The days are quite short in winter and the water was around 5 degrees but we wore a thick wetsuit and of course with Orca around, the cold was quickly forgotten. The light had a really nice colour from the setting sun as this graceful pod of Orca swam by nice and close. It was a moment which will be hard to top and I'm glad to have this image to share it.\" Photo by: Nicholai Georgiou/UPY Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Magic moment \nEdward Herreño of Colombia took third place in the wide-angle category with this photo taken in November off the coast of Indonesia. \n\"I was lucky to join an expedition aboard MV Ondina covering Raja Ampat North, Central & South,\" Herreño said. \"The South is one of my favourite places because only few boats go there. We went to dive to the sea mount 'Karang Paradise' where the biodiversity is something unique; endless coral fields, large congregations of fish and big pelagic travelers passing by. At the end of one of the dives, I found this enormous coral field full of different groups of fish. I wanted to show in my pictures the motion (I've taking motion pictures with very slow shutter speed for long time), so I set up my camera on top of a rock (I didn't have my tripod), then after few minutes completely still, this big congregation of big eye jacks came and complete surround me. A magic moment!\" Photo by: Edward Herreño/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Dog, or polar bear? \nEero Hällfors of Finland was highly commended for this image, \"Walking,\" taken in December 2016 in his home country. \n\"It was the first cold days last November and the lake had just frozen,\" Hällfors said. \"I had a plan to do some ice diving and take nice pictures of the lake getting stronger ice cover. I didn't have much success with this plan so I started to look upwards through the ice in order to locate my fellows on the ice. Instead of them I realized that our two dogs were walking just above me with my wife. The other dogs stood still for a moment to sniff the ice - that is when I took this pic.\" Photo by: Eero Hallfors/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Prey? \nSo Yat Wai of Hong Kong won first place in the macro category with this image, titled \"Prey?\" It was taken in May 2016 off the Philippines. \n\"This photo was shot during a blackwater dive in Anilao,\" the photographer said. \"Even though the larvae mantis shrimp (left) is very small, it still a predator which uses its raptorial appendages to hunt. Has it spotted the prey and is ready to pounce?\" Photo by: So Yat Wai/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Graceful ballet \nJenny Stromvoll of Mozambique was named runner-up in the Macro category for \"Graceful Ballet,\" taken in December 2016 off the coast of her home country. \n\"Since we found this dive site, which consists of a sea pen forest at 34m, we have discovered new species to the area, Stromvoll said. \"One of my favorite subjects has been the blue sea pen which hosts different shrimps and gobies. With its flowing lines and beautiful polyps, any subject inside this orange and blue sea pen is beautifully offset and lends itself to an artistic composition.\" Photo by: Jenny Stromvoll/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Shipwreck at sunset \nCsaba Tökölyi of Hungary claimed first place in the Wrecks category with this image, captioned \"The wreck of the Louilla at sunset,\" taken in Egypt in June 2014. \n\"This is the wreck of the Louilla resting on top of Gordon Reef in the Straits of Tiran on the edge of the Sinai,\" Tökölyi said. \"Beneath her lies a pile of her anchor chains, giving the form of a whale. Wrecks become part of the ecosystem in no time. Soft corals develop very soon and they can become shelter for schools of juvenile fish. But also, they can have a devastating effect on their surroundings. This wreck sits on top of Gordon Reef, battered by the waves and is slowly deteriorating. Last summer, part of the superstructure collapsed, and the wreck lost its epic, cinematic look. In a few decades, the reef should be free again from the remains of this once-huge freighter.\" Photo by: Csaba Tokolyi/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Bomber down below \nMarcus Blatchford of the UK was commended in the Wrecks category for \"Jill Bomber,\" taken in November off the Federated States of Micronesia. \n\"I visited Truk Lagoon to dive the infamous 'Ghost Fleet,'\" Blatchford said. \"After a week this was a bit of a (curve) ball compared to the rest of the huge, amazing shipwrecks we dived and simply just a plane. To be more exact a Nakajima B6N 'Jill' Bomber. The resort we stayed in 'Blue Lagoon', in WW2 was a Japanese airfield. The Jill is around 200m from the bar. My tactics changed for the plane, up until this point I had been aiming for simple photographs but for the Jill I decided to try to map the area using 3D photogrammetry. I captured 408 photos of the aircraft which when fed into some very cleaver whizz-bangery resulted in a complete orbital 3D model.\" Photo by: Marcus Blatchford/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Mouth guests \nQing Lin of Canada won first place in the Behaviour category for this image, \"Your Home and My Home,\" taken off Indonesia in February. \n\"The parasitic isopods like to hang out in the mouths of anemone fish,\" the photographer wrote. \"Perhaps because of the isopods, clown anemone fish often open their mouths. These three particular fish were very curious. As I approached, they danced about the camera lens. It took me six dives, patience and luck to capture the exact moment when all three fish opened their mouths to reveal their guests. Finally, on the last day, on the last dive, I succeeded.\" Photo by: Qing Lin/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Hitching a ride \nPasquale Vassallo of Italy was highly commended for this photo, submitted in the Behaviour category and taken off the Gulf of Naples in November 2016. \n\"Over the past few months, my photographic work has focused primarily on the large presence of species of jellyfish Rhizostoma pulmo, in the Gulf of Naples,\" Vassallo wrote. \"In this picture a couple of crabs, Liocarcinus vernalis species, are its tenants. When the jellyfish rub the sandy seabed, the crabs jump on it and get carried to different areas.\" Photo by: Pasquale Vassallo/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Face to face \nLorincz Ferenc won first place in the portrait category with this image taken in the Red Sea in August 2016. \n\"We were photographing a big school of bat fish in front of the fully blue background in Shark Rafeen, Rash Mohamed National Park in Egypt, but it is extremely hard to capture a school of fish in a nice position, especially with divers swimming by all the time, so I gave up trying,\" the photographer said. \"Not so far from the others, I noticed a crevice in a rock, which fish used as a cleaning station, and slowly, very slowly, I swam into the gap, switching places with the cleaning fish. This made it possible to photograph this bat fish front on.\" Photo by: Lorincz Ferencz/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Sea lion playing with starfish \nSpanish photographer Francis Pérez took this image in October in Mexican waters. It won a commendation in the Portrait category. \n\"In Los Islotes, there is one of the most important sea lion kindergartens in Mexico,\" the photographer explains. \"I went there looking for pictures of sea lions eating on the big sardine banks. I was not lucky, because there were no sardines, but I found many interesting things, such as the one I show in this photo, a juvenile sea lion playing with starfish...My intention was to capture the moment when sea lions caught a star with their mouths, to capture a dynamic image. I spent about four hours in the water, I came and went to the area where there were more juveniles, until finally getting closer little by little, and with respect, I was able to capture this photo.\" Photo by: Francis Pérez/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners I've got my eye on you \nJenny Stromvoll of Mozambique won the Compact category with this image, taken in April 2016 in her home country's waters. \n\"I have shot many whip gobies, but this particular shot was taken with the Inon compact bug-eye lens which added a lot of character to the goby's eye,\" she explained. \"The trick was to get close enough without the goby moving away. I was fortunate enough to find a very forgiving goby who allowed me into his private space. I knew I had to get down low and shoot up to include the surface of the water. I shot this scene many times before getting the image I was after.\" Photo by: Jenny Stromvoll/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Shocking \nFabio Russo of Italy was commended for this entry in the Compact ategory, taken in Italian waters in July 2016. \n\"The ventral side of an ocellate torpedo, or eyed electric ray (Torpedo torpedo), is not easy to photograph,\" Russo said. \"I took advantage of a free swimming one and quickly descended to the seabed to shoot its underside. For attack and defense, the torpedo can deliver a strong electric shock of up to 200 volts, so it's not a good idea to touch it.\" Photo by: Fabio Russo/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Coral safe haven \nJenny Stromvoll, the winner in this category with another image , also was highly commended for this photo, taken off Mozambique in June 2016. \n\"While searching for soft coral cowries inside the thistle corals, I came across this goby,\" she wrote. \"For me, the colour of the Dendronephthya flesh and the goby's very translucent body and striking green eyes, would make a very delicate and soft photo. I wanted to get a photograph with a lot of depth to it, which was achieved by framing the goby with the soft coral branches. Personally this is one of my favourite photos as it has such a feminine touch to it.\" Photo by: Jenny Stromvoll/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Welcome to the jungle \nAmerican photographer Linda McKean was commended for this entry in the compact category, taken in September 2016 off the Bahamas. \n\"Diving with Blue Iguana Charters and all the shark action at Tiger Beach, the Bahamas was one of the most exciting (underwater photography) opportunities of my life,\" she wrote. \"I really wasn't sure what it would be like but the best way I can describe it is that we were surrounded by sharks. The most numerous were the Caribbean Reef and Lemon Sharks, but the stars of the show were clearly the magnificent female Tiger Sharks. Their beauty, size and graceful movement captivated me as they slowly cruised the area and I wanted to capture that feeling in my photographs. I was about two meters off the bottom when I took this face-on shot of one of the Tiger Sharks the dive crew called 'Smiley' due to the little crooked smile she always seems to have on her face.\" Photo by: Linda McKean/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Hello World! \nJenny Stromvoll again -- the photographer was commended for this entry in the Compact category, taken off Mozambique in January 2015. \n\"I found this cluster of Cuttlefish eggs on a reef called Doodles in Ponta do Ouro,\" she said. \"All the eggs looked dark to start with, however, as I looked closer, I noticed one slightly more opaque than the rest. This one was getting ready to hatch! In order to ready himself for defensive maneuvers in the outside world, he absorbed the last drops of ink which his mother had infused into the egg sac. This is when I pressed the shutter button. Moments later the tiny creature set off to start his new life in the big blue.\" Photo by: Jenny Stromvoll/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Turbulent flow \nCanadian Sean Landsman scored a runner-up award in the Up and Coming category for this image, taken off Prince Edward Island in April 2016. \n\"This image is part of a larger project to document the anadromous (adult growth in saltwater, birth/spawning in freshwater) fishes of eastern North Americ,\" Landsman explains. \"It depicts a migratory alewife barreling through the turbulent flow at the base of a fish ladder. This location in Prince Edward Island, Canada has a dam that impedes access to the spawning habitat. Alewife need slow-moving pond or lake environments to spawn in and can only access them with fish ladders or similar structures if a dam is present. Anadromous fishes, like alewife, transport high-quality marine-derived nutrients into freshwater ecosystems, providing food for all sorts of aquatic organisms. It was very difficult to see the fish moving through the bubbly water, much less time my trigger finger with their movements correctly. It took dozens of frames to get this one image, but all it takes is one!\" Photo by: Sean Landsman/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Through the coral window \nFrench photographer Léna Remy was commended in the Up & Coming Photographer category for this image, taken in August 2015 off the coast of Bali. \n\"I noticed this yellow fish turning quickly around the coral,\" said Remy. \"I positioned myself to have blue water background surrounded by red coral. I waited for the fish to take this posture in the middle of the coral window. I was happy to capture the short moment the fish looked at the camera, exactly in the middle of the blue.\" Photo by: Léna Remy/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Taking a dive \nBritish photographer Richard Shucksmith was the runner-up in the British Waters Wide Angle category for this image, taken in July 2016. \n\"I was out off the coast making images for 'Scotland: The Big Picture,' -- a project about re-wilding that produces images to amplify the case for a wilder Scotland,\" he said. \"Hundreds of gannets were circling the boat looking for the fish that were being thrown over the side. Suddenly a single bird dives, and the others see it as an indicator and 20, 30, 40 birds are diving at once. ... I could hear the birds as they hit the water right above my head just before they appeared in front of the camera. A great experience.\" Photo by: Richard Shucksmith Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Can I help you? \nEllen Cuylaerts of the Cayman Islands was commended in the British Waters Wide Angle category for this image, taken off the coast of England in November 2016. \n\"Last November, when we visited the largest colony of grey seals in the UK, the super moon caused huge tidal changes, some nasty currents and bad visibility,\" she said. \"But being in the water with these curious creatures is a joy even if you can only see them when you turn around at the surface and they look at you, all big eyes, before they disappear again in the cloud of murkiness. We stayed in the water as long as the tides allowed us, changed locations a few times and when we were dropped very close to some rocks without kelp beds around, the sun came out and improved the visibility greatly. As if the seals knew this would be their chance on a nice portrait, they came really close, I added some Sola light to the ambient light to be able to dial down my settings a bit and catch the low sun rays lighting the whiskers from both sides!\" Photo by: Ellen Cuylaerts/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Dragon display \nBritish photographer Kirsty Andrews won the British Waters Macro category with this image, taken off Cornwall in July 2016. \n\" This cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) noticed me before I noticed it,\" Andrews wrote. \"As I passed, it was skulking behind a rock and wafting its tentacles in what was either a kelpy camouflage tactic or an attempt to warn me away. Cuttlefish will often make this type of threat display and only retreat once it's clear that the diving photographer or other recipient has not been appropriately cowed. Although I was not too intimidated, I do love the pose and to me, the outstretched strobe-lit tentacles against a dark background bring to mind a fearsome Chinese dragon. Cuttlefish are fascinating, beautiful creatures and I have had some wonderful experiences in British waters watching them breed, fight, feed, or just interact with divers. I find it terribly sad that in some former hotspots, increased use of cuttlefish pots, especially during the mating season, has had a devastating impact on cuttlefish numbers.\" Photo by: Kirsty Andrews/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners Shrimp star \nBritish photographer Matt Doggett was named runner-up in the British Waters Macro category for this image taken off Scotland in January 2016. \n\"Whilst diving in Loch Carron over the New Year we noticed that these tiny, colourful amphipod shrimps occurred in their hundreds amongst the kelp in a narrow depth band between around 5-8m,\" he said. \"They seemed to be feeding on the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea (a colonial animal) which grows on the kelp fronds and provides both the foreground and background to this image. Less than 1 cm in length, the shrimps proved an irresistible challenge to photograph during decompression stops. They often buzzed around in the spotting lamp beam like a busy swarm of wasps, meaning I had to be quick to capture one if it sat still for a second.\" Photo by: Matt Doggett/UPY 2017 Dive under the sea with 'Underwater Photographer' winners The eyes have it \nThis image by British photographer Trevor Rees, taken off Scotland in July 2014, was highly commended in the British Waters Macro category \n\"I've tried many times to photograph these long clawed squat lobsters (Munida rugosa),\" Rees said. \"For this individual I was diving in the Sound of Mull on Scotland's west coast. They are a common subject but finding a cooperative one was the key to this shot -- so that I could inch slowly forward and get an intimate, closely framed head-on composition. A tightly snooted single strobe gave the lighting I wanted to show off the striking red colour and large eyes of these attractive crustaceans.\" Photo by: Trevor Rees", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:53:16.376+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
