The women, believed to be North Korean operatives, are still at large. \nOnce seen as a likely successor to Kim Jong Un’s father, Kim Jong Nam was thought to have fallen out of favour with his father, when he tried to enter Japan, using a false passport. \nHe had told officials that he was planning to visit Tokyo Disneyland. \nHaving lost out on becoming his father’s successor in 2011, Jong-Nam maintained a low profile, spending most of his time overseas in Macau, Singapore and China.
