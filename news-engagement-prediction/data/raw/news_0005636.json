The protest comes at the end of a week where protests in cities across the world called on President Trump to end the controversial policy. As thousands were detained at US airports, and 60,000 US visas were revoked, protesters picketed American embassies from Jakarta to Rome.

Protests against the ban have been organised in at least 12 UK cities, including Sheffield, Brighton and Birmingham. Protest outside Downing Street sees tens of thousands demonstrate against Trump's immigration ban President Trump's executive order suspended refugee resettlement in the US for 120 days and barred Syrian refugees indefinitely. It also barred travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries - Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Sudan and Somalia. However, the Trump administration suffered an embarrassing setback on Friday, after a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked the executive order regarding the travel ban. In Australia, thousands rallied on Friday after it emerged that Trump had described a planned refugee resettlement deal, which would relocate 1,250 refugees from the controversial Nauru and Manus Island detention camps to the US, as “dumb”. Around 1,000 people marched on the US embassy in Sydney, while hundreds more gathered in Melbourne. Australian Senator Richard di Natale said in a post on his Facebook page: “Last night Melbourne said \"No\" to the politics of Donald Trump and the far-right in Australia.” This is the start of a collective resistance movement as people from all walks of life come together and say no to hatred.” Anti-Trump protest in Melbourne Hundreds of protesters marched down Swanston Street, chanting and yelling slogans against the US President pic.twitter.com/hTpMirq1AC — Brandi Saari (@brandilmelb) February 3, 2017 Earlier in the week, protestors in the Philippines and Indonesia burned American flags outside their countries’ US embassies. Neither country is in the list of banned countries, but Trump’s immigration policies could have a tangible effect on both nations.

Just hours after the protest ended, the government’s special envoy to the US revealed that more than 300,000 Filipinos living in America are at risk of deportation. 3,000 people are expected to gather in Paris on Saturday for a #NoBanNoWall protest, while in the US, demonstrations have been organised in Miami, Washington, LA and New York.
