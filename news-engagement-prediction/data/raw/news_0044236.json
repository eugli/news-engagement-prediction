We finally got a taste of that fruit, and we want to be there and we want to stay there.” \nWith one of baseball’s best starting rotations, deepest bullpens and a lineup counting on the return of All-Star Michael Brantley from injury, the Indians, who lost 94 games in 2012, are positioned to make another run at ending a World Series title drought stretching to 1948 — now the majors’ longest. \nCleveland has vaulted from powderpuff to powerhouse. \nThe Indians are determined to erase the memory of last year’s Series when they gave away a 3-1 lead to the Cubs, who completed their comeback by winning an unforgettable Game 7 on Nov. 2 in extra innings. Chicago’s victory not only triggered a celebration on the soggy grass in Progressive Field, but a national outpouring of affection for the lovable Cubbies and their fans, who waited 108 years to sip championship champagne. \nThere was obvious heartache in Cleveland. But also hope. \nBy going so far in the postseason despite not having Brantley, missing starters Carlos Carrasco and Danny Salazar and losing starter Trevor Bauer in the AL Championship Series when he sliced open his right little finger while repairing a drone at home, the Indians showed resiliency, confidence and a glimpse of their potential. \nThey were one step away, and this year the Indians are better prepared to take it. \nKipnis pointed to the Kansas City Royals, who bounced back from losing Game 7 of the World Series in 2014 to winning it the following year, as a model for the Indians. \n“They knew they wanted to be right back there,” he said. “They knew what it might take to fill in the hole from what they were missing the year before and they went out and did it. We’re kind of hoping to follow that path and there are guys who now know what it takes and what they need to work on and what they need to kind of fix to get back there. It gives you that past experience that now you don’t have to ask any questions. You have that experience yourself.” \nWith a light rain falling and the nearby Estrella Mountains shrouded in low clouds, manager Terry Francona laid out his expectations during a team meeting on Sunday. Francona said he spent the past week stressing over how to deliver the proper message —“cutting and pasting the old-fashioned way, erasing”— as he felt he owed his players a clear outlook for 2017. \nFrancona wants his players to be proud of what they accomplished, but not to dwell upon the success or be satisfied. He reminded them not to cut corners or take anything for granted. \n“Our players have with their talent, and with the way they have played, people think they have a chance of doing some pretty good things,” he said. “Now you gotta go out and do it and there’s a way to do it. …If (baseball) said, `Hey, man, you went to the World Series last year, you get five extra wins.’ We’d take them. But that’s not how it’s going to be.” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:30:56.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
