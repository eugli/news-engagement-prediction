The most recent was Brady and the Patriots two years ago against the Seattle Seahawks. \nREAD MORE: George H.W. Bush, wife Barbara, appear for Super Bowl pregame coin toss \nWhile so many were expecting a shootout, a scoreless first quarter in the Super Bowl is nothing new for Tom Brady. \nEach team punted twice in the first quarter. The biggest highlight was Devonta Freeman’s 37-yard run for Atlanta. But the Falcons didn’t get another first down on that drive. \nFor the first time in 11 years, both teams punted on each of their first two offensive possessions in a Super Bowl. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:11:11.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
