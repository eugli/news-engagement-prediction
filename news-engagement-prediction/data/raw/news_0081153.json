Bomb threats forcing evacuation of Jewish community centers. \nAnother wave of intimidation targeting Jewish communities swept across the nation Monday, and community leaders and law enforcement struggled to stop it. \nJewish sites reported at least 16 bomb threats, said Mark Potok, senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center. The latest series of attacks was the fifth this year. \n\"I have been here more than 20 years and I've never seen anything like it,\" Potok said. \"There are provocateurs out there who say that if you don't like somebody, go after them.\" \nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said Monday that President Trump was \"deeply disappointed and concerned\" by the cemetery vandalism and other acts. \n“The president continues to condemn these and any other forms of anti-Semitic and hateful acts in the strongest terms,” Spicer said. \nBut Potok and Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt say Trump has failed to consistently speak out against anti-Semitic rhetoric. \n\"I think, in large part, the election of Donald Trump let the genie of anti-Semitism out of the bottle,\" Potok said. \"And it's not going to go back in easily.\" Bomb threats again rattle Jewish centers \nGreenblatt said Monday's threats raised the total this year to about 90. No bombs had been found. \nIn Wilmington, Del., Sen. Tom Carper was meeting with Jewish community leaders at the Siegel Jewish Community Center to discuss the climate of threats and violence when someone called in a bomb threat . The center was evacuated, police investigated, and programs resumed a short time later. \n\"It is heartbreaking for such a flash of fear to overtake a place of strong community and joy that brings together people of all ages under one roof — from the babies in the day care center to the senior citizens taking part in exercise classes,\" Carper said. \"These acts must end.\" \nEvacuating small children and the elderly from the building, sometimes in bad weather, is no minor event. The constant threat keeps communities on edge. \n\"The bottom line is that this is not normal,\" Greenblatt said. \"This is not acceptable. We have people wondering about sending their kids to community center, to their day school.\" \nIn Missouri, more than 150 headstones were vandalized Feb. 20 at the Chesed Shel Emeth Society Cemetery. Two days later, hundreds of volunteers showed up to help repair the damage. In Philadelphia, residents rallied behind the Jewish community after vandals toppled scores of headstones over the weekend. \n\"Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens did a wonderful job of pulling together an interfaith effort,\" Greenblatt said. \"But you really have to stretch to find a silver lining when a community is under siege.\" \nThe FBI launched an investigation into the community center threats last month. The bureau publicly announced that agents and prosecutors assigned to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division were weighing possible civil rights violations. \nLocal law enforcement authorities are overseeing separate investigations into the cemetery vandalism. \nBomb threat cases can be extremely challenging because of the broad access to technology, said Ron Hosko, a former chief of the FBI's criminal division. \n\"There are so many ways to maintain your anonymity — whether it is special software or throwaway phones — they (suspects) can play this out for some time,'' Hosko said. \"You are having to sort through whether this is an organized effort, a single person or copy cats.\" \nIn New York state, at least four centers became targets Monday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. \n\"Today we witnessed additional bomb threats directed at JCCs,\" Cuomo tweeted. \"We will do everything to catch those responsible for this #antiSemitic act.\" \nAmong other threats: A bomb threat at North Carolina's Asheville Jewish Community Center forced a brief evacuation while Asheville police checked the interior and exterior of the facility, police spokeswoman Christina Hallingse said. Nothing suspicious was found, so a bomb squad was not called in. \"Investigation into the incident is ongoing,\" she said. Operations at the Jewish Community Center of Indianapolis ground to a halt for about an hour while bomb-sniffing dogs and investigators swept the property before an all-clear was issued. \nRep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., last week wrote a letter urging the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. attorney general and the FBI director to take \"swift action\" to address the significant number of bomb threats that have been telephoned in to Jewish community centers across the nation. The letter was co-signed by 150 members of Congress. \nLaw enforcement must \"do everything within their power to punish those responsible for the threats that have already taken place, to prevent future threats from occurring, and to ensure these threats are never converted into action,\" Murphy said. \nDavid Posner, director of strategic performance at JCC Association of North America, said his membership was grateful to local law enforcement for ensuring that the centers are safe. He called on the White House, Congress and federal authorities to step up their efforts. \n“Actions speak louder than words,\" he said, calling for swift action to identify and capture those \"who are trying to instill anxiety and fear in our communities.\" \nContributing: Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY; Brittany Horn, The (Wilmington, Del.)
