I watched the show and I was riveted and not just because it’s visually stunning. Noah Hawley ( Fargo ) — who is one of my favorite creators — is giving us something totally different.” \nThe series, which is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, follows David Haller ( Downton Abbey’s Dan Stevens), a mutant diagnosed with schizophrenia at a young age who struggles to get a grasp on what is reality and what is fantasy. \n“You don’t have to be a superhero fan to like this; this is about someone who has been told all his life he’s schizophrenic,” explains Shaw. “You don’t know if what you’re seeing is true or if what you’re seeing is happening inside this character’s mind. There’s dance numbers, there’s a great escape, there’s Jean Smart…” \n“There’s a war going on, somehow,” chips in Touré. \n“This is one of my favorite things I’ve seen in the past six months,” concludes Shaw. \nLegion premieres Wednesday, Feb. 8 at 10 p.m. on FX.
