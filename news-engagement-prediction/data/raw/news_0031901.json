Read more New surveillance powers endorsed \nHowever opponents suggest that the measures could lead to further steps that will eventually allow all non-Swiss residents - 25% of the population - to gain easy citizenship. \nAn opposition poster, which features a woman in a burka, suggests that the new proposal could lead to a so-called \"Islamisation\" of the country. \nThe current vetting procedure, aimed at ensuring that new citizens are well integrated, includes interviews carried out by town councils. Questions put to interviewees can include requests to name local cheeses or mountains. \nThose in favour of maintaining the current system also argue that the strict vetting rules make it superior to the more anonymous systems in neighbouring France and Germany. \nOver the past 30 years, three previous attempts to relax the rules have been defeated. This time, opinion polls suggest the vote on Sunday will be close. Big cities back the idea, while more conservative rural areas oppose it.
