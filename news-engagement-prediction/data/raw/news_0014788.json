At left is Shirin Montazeri, a fellow graduate student and member of the Iranian Student Association. BOSTON – University of Massachusetts Amherst graduate student Mohsen Hosseini was welcomed back to the U.S. today by university officials at Logan International Airport, culminating a weeklong series of legal and other support in response to the president’s executive order seeking to restrict entry to the U.S. by citizens of seven countries. Hosseini is a graduate student from Iran enrolled in the university’s electrical and computer engineering program. Among those welcoming him at Logan Airport were a representative from the university’s Office of International Programs, university counsel, fellow international students and his faculty advisor. “We extend a warm welcome to Mohsen, and we are deeply grateful to everyone who provided assistance so he can continue his studies at UMass Amherst,” said Chancellor Kumble Subbaswamy. “Moshen and the more than 3,500 other international students, scholars and staff at UMass Amherst play a vital role in the daily life and success of the Commonwealth’s flagship campus.” Link", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:44:19.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
