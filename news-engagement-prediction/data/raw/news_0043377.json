Kings' owner Vivek Ranadive's otherworldly belief in 23-year-old rookie Buddy Hield. \nSources close to the Kings indicate Ranadive believes Hield has \"Steph Curry potential,\" according to Baxter Holmes of ESPN : \nHield is averaging 8.6 points per game while shooting 36.9 percent from three-point range this season. He did have an impressive 28-point outing in the Rising Stars Challenge during All-Star weekend, however. \nIt took Curry years to develop into the superstar he's become, and the same could be true for Hield. Thinking Hield has the same potential as a generational talent in Curry is a huge reach, but was a key thinking point for Kings' ownership. \nHield broke out as an Oklahoma State Cowboy, averaging an astonishing 25 points per game while shooting 45.7 percent from three-point range. He was a gifted collegiate scorer who is still learning his way at the professional level. \nPotential is a funny thing, though, and being a star player in college often doesn't translate to success in the NBA. Hield also had the advantage of being a four-year player with Oklahoma State. \nIf Hield does pan out to be a Curry-esque player for Sacramento then Ranadive, will certainly have the last laugh. It's hard to envision the ball bouncing that way, however. \nDo you think Hield can develop into a star player for Sacramento, or was this a panic move? Let us know in the comments!
