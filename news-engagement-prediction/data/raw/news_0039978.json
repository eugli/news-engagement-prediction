Mayweather has since denied this is the case, claiming he is \"happily retired\". \nMcGregor insists he is pursuing the fight though and has sent another message out to Mayweather on Instagram. \nHe posed alongside former UFC owner Lorenzo Fertitta and warned: \"Nobody in the history of the fight game has come up as fast and as young as I have. https://www.instagram.com/p/BQjmSiWB4ND/embed \n\"I now, at 28 years of age, have my eyes firmly set on the 'highest paid fighter' and 'highest earning athlete' accolades. \n\"Understand and respect what you are witnessing here. Because not one of you can do nothing to stop it.\" \nMcGregor uploaded another image as he continues his trip to Las Vegas alongside the caption \"I run every game.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:17:18.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
