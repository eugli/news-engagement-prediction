Chicago picks after Cleveland and San Francisco in the upcoming NFL Draft, owning the No. 3 overall selection after finishing this past season 3-13. \nTo no surprise, the Patriots are favorites to win Super Bowl LII after earning a 34-28 overtime victory against the Falcons in Sunday’s championship. New England is listed as a 5-1 favorites, ahead of Dallas and Green Bay, each at 9-1. \nAs for the Bears, a busy offseason looms, with general manager Ryan Pace preparing with ample cap room for free agency and high draft picks to utilize.
