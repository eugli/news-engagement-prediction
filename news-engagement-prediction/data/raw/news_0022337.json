(Jason Warick/CBC)\nParton said it's great to see growing numbers of cyclists commuting to work, even in the winter.\n\"People are realizing it's easier than they thought it was. It's a good way to get to work or go out at night. We have bike lanes now, so we're really becoming a big city,\" she said.\nCyclist Joe McDonald, who bikes to work every day, agreed. Some parts of the city are difficult to cycle through in winter because of the absence of trails or adequate shoulders. But there are many parts of the city that are becoming bicycle-friendly, he said.\nJoe McDonald stopped at a pop-up hot chocolate station Friday morning on 4th Avenue in Saskatoon to celebrate international Winter Bike to Work Day.

He smiled as they handed him some dessert and a cup of hot chocolate.\n\"It's actually pretty cool. I've never seen anybody do this before,\" he said.\nCyclists can sign up online and say they've biked to work as part of a competition.
