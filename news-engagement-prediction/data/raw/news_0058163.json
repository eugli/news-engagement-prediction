Someone hammered 4-inch long galvanized nails and left them sticking out a half- to 1 inch, and at an angle so they’re like spikes.”\nOne person was hurt and another stepped on a nail that went through his shoe but didn’t hurt his foot.\n“It’s hard to believe someone would do this and put a lot of effort in to doing this,” Barwatt said.\nThe East Fork and West Fork trails, each 3.5 miles long, lead to the Black Rock summit on a mixed gravel road and single track terrain, completely surrounded by woods in a remote area of town.\n“We want to assure people we’re taking this very seriously and taking care of it swiftly,” he said.\nThere is a $1,000 reward leading to information about the case. Anyone with information is asked to call the Sylva Police Department at 828-586-2916.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d89f1eebb7b8c68f6e237f94d7c9aeb9383f6dbd/c=181-0-1258-810&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2017/02/20/CarolinaGroup/Asheville/636232040618841468-Pinnacle-Park-nails-courtesy-photo.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33d97f8a03d5ea06baca0f7a30eca34c8bd87643/r=500x281/local/-/media/2017/02/20/CarolinaGroup/Asheville/636232040618841468-Pinnacle-Park-nails-courtesy-photo.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/2lqTra0&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/20/CarolinaGroup/Asheville/636232040618841468-Pinnacle-Park-nails-courtesy-photo.jpg", "http://avlne.ws/2lfwsjS", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/experiments/usatoday/responsive/maps/293-022117-pinnacle-park-nails/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/2lqTra0&text=Runner%27s%20foot%20impaled%20by%20nail%20purposely%20placed%20on%20trail%2C%2040%20total%20found%20in%20park&via=azcentral"], "published": "2017-02-21T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:25:49.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
