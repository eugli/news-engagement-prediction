With the second leg against Bayern looming next move, they are on course for a seventh straight exit at the last 16 stage of the Champions League.\nFour big calls made by Wenger at Bayern which pointed to a manager who has gone stale | by Jason Burt W enger is also sensitive to the mood of supporters and the division that now exists over his future. Witnesses to some of the clashes among Arsenal fans on Wednesday night told The Telegraph that the atmosphere between supporters was the worst they had known. Wenger will be pressed on his future at his 9am press conference on Friday but is expected to again stress that no decisions have been made.\nSpeaking just hours before Wednesday’s match, he reiterated his repeated response that his future would be determined much closer to the end of the season. Asked by the German radio station ZDF when he would specifically decide, Wenger said: \"March, April probably.”\nThe last Arsenal team to win a Champions League knockout tie W enger has also said that he may take a very sudden decision – based on his “gut feeling” – and there is still a possibility that he will view the season very differently in May if the team finish strongly in both the Premier League and FA Cup.\nArsenal do expect Wenger to give them time to approach replacements but do not believe that there is any immediate urgent need for clarity.\nA succession plan has been worked upon – and a list of names that include Thomas Tuchel, Max Allegri, Eddie Howe and Leonardo Jardim have been under active consideration – but no managers have been directly approached. Indeed, should the season somehow finish on a major high, the club would still be very open to honouring a new two-year contract that was suggested before Christmas.\nBorussia Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel is being tipped to replace Arsene Wenger Credit: EPA D espite the uncertainty, Wenger has been actively working with the club on summer preparations, both on their transfer priorities and a pre-season tour to Australia and China. Arsenal also point out there is still more than a third of the Premier League season remaining. They are currently fourth, 10 points behind Chelsea, but in a pack with all the other leading contenders.\nThe club’s owner, Stan Kroenke, has also always been absolute in his support for Wenger and, in previous interviews with The Telegraph , has suggested that he would let his manager decide when it was right to step down. \nMany of those closest to Wenger do now believe that he is approaching that decision but, in conversations with The Telegraph , their pessimism was also tempered by the recognition that he could feel very differently if he was able to oversee a miraculous turnaround.\nA rsenal’s next match is at Sutton United on Monday night in the fifth round of the FA Cup. Wenger is expected to be without several leading players for that match, including Sanchez – who has been given some time off – and captain Laurent Koscielny, who is recovering from the thigh injury he suffered in Munich.\nHe must also decide whether to rest Mesut Ozil, who has been strongly criticised following the 5-1 defeat and a succession of largely anonymous performances.\nBayern v Arsenal ratings W enger’s loyalty to Ozil in his selection decisions is being privately questioned by some other players but the German’s agent believes that he is being made a scapegoat.\n“Mesut feels people are not focusing on his performance; they are using him as a scapegoat for the team after bad results,\" Dr Erkut Sogut told BBC Sport . “Bayern had 74 per cent possession,\" said Sogut. “How can someone in the No 10 position create chances if you don't have the ball? In these games people usually target a player who cost a lot of money and earns a lot of money - that is Mesut. But he can't be always be the scapegoat. That's not fair.\n\"Football is a team sport and Arsenal are not performing well as a team. Eleven players were on the pitch but Mesut was singled out for criticism. It was as if everyone knew Arsenal would not make it through and we needed a scapegoat. This is not right. You win as a team and you lose as a team.\"\nArsenal six straight last-16 Champions League defeats", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:24:49.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
