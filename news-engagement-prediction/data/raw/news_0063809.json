Fresh surveys showed Trump's popularity is languishing -- threatening to sap his political capital just weeks into a four-year term.\nA Quinnipiac University poll reported 38 percent of voters think Trump is doing a good job. Fifty-five percent believe he is doing a bad job.\nThat is unparalleled for a modern president so early in his term.\nPerhaps worse for the White House, 63 percent of voters said Trump is not level-headed and 55 percent said he is not honest.\nFor any normal politician, those numbers would be disastrous -- emboldening political rivals and encouraging allies to keep their distance.\nMany in Washington are already looking toward Congressional elections in 2018, which present a challenge for incumbent Republicans.\nMid-term elections often serve as a referendum on the president and Democrats are baying to retake 24 seats and control of the House of Representatives, which would put a serious check on Trump's agenda.\nAgainst that backdrop, Republicans may be stuck between an unpopular president and public opprobrium.\nCongressional Republicans privately fret that opposing Trump could invite angry tweets, a grassroots firestorm and perhaps even a Trumpite challenger in the next party primary.\nThey may have reason to worry. A Pew Research poll released Wednesday showed rank-and-file Republicans are still likely to back Trump in an argument with party lawmakers.\n\"About half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (52 percent) say that if Trump and Republican congressional leaders disagree on an issue, they would be more likely to trust Trump,\" Pew said.\n\"About a third (34 percent) say they would trust GOP leaders if they have a disagreement with the president.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:03:19.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
