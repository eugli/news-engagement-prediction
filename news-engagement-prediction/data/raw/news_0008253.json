That will take the number of sworn cops to 9800 and total police staffing to 13000. There will be a big focus on regional and rural areas and also child protection. \nEnglish says New Zealand is the fourth safest country in the world but demand for traditional police services is growing and complex and \"serious crime is absorbing more police\". \nREAD MORE: \nEnglish says there are three components to the package - targeting and catching offenders, preventing crime and victimisation and delivering a more responsive service. It includes more funding for the wider justice sector. \nThe first new recruits will begin training in July and hit the beat in November. \n\"Evidence tells us that if we want to reduce reoffending we need to address the underlying drivers of dysfunction rather than just respond to the symptoms,\" English said. \nPressure has been building on the government to match Labour and NZ First promises to boost police numbers in response to rising concern about youth crime in particular. \nEnglish said all police districts would receive extra police officers from the additional resources which are in response to a rise in recorded crime over the last two years, particularly burglaries, robberies and assaults. Ad Feedback \nThe Government will also roll out a new national 24/7 phone number for non -emergencies to take pressure off the 111 system. \nPolice Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Paula Bennett said the number would cater for calls that weren't appropriate for 111 including reporting low level or historic crime and giving information about suspicious activities. \nBennett said the extra sworn cops would include 140 more police officers for up to 20 regions. \nAnd rural police stations, so that 95 per cent of the population lives within a 25 km radius of a 24/7 police presence. \nThere will also be 140 additional specialist investigators for child protection, sexual assault, family violence and other serious crime (66 of these have already been announced). \nThe Government will also fund 12 mobile policing units to provide policing services in smaller towns, rural areas and community events - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:20:59.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
