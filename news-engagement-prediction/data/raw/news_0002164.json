Article continues below \nSpeaking ahead of the tournament, Brown has revealed how he has some unusual inspiration going into the campaign. \nHe is, in fact, using Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Article continues below Adam Lallana reveals exactly what he eats in 24 hours - and it's ridiculous \nIt's a big year for the 31-year-old, with the Six Nations fast approaching, the potential to play for the British and Irish Lions, and his personal mission to rescue wheelchair rugby after it had its £2.9 million funding removed by UK Sport. \nYou need inspiration when you're taking on mammoth tasks such as these. \nMike Brown's comes from none other than Manchester United's Ibrahimovic. \nAlthough it may seem to the casual observer that Brown is in the latter stages of his career, he still remains England's go-to fullback despite the emergence of the likes of Anthony Watson, Elliot Daly, and Alex Lozowski. \nBrown feels in a good way before England's Six Nations defence begins on Saturday, and he puts this down in some way to the inspiration of Zlatan. \nHe said : “I’m in great nick, I feel I’m getting better all the time. \n“As a United fan, I see what Zlatan is doing [at Manchester United] and he’s 35. \n“He says, 'You’re older but you’re not OLD' and that’s how I see it too. I’ve still got a lot of time ahead of me\". \nDespite this inspiration, Brown has acquired the assistance of Margot Wells in order to increase his speed, who helped her husband Allan Wells become Olympic 100m champion. \nBrown has also looked to Jonny Wilkinson for help: “Wilko has been unbelievable for me. \n“He has had a huge effect on my kicking and my all-round game. I’ve offered to pay him but he says he just loves working with people who want to improve\". \nBrown has been known for his fiery temper for much of his career, and says that he still has that in his locker, if needs be. \n“I still have that in-your-face style if I need it”. \nWith this attitude, England rugby fans should look forward to what Brown can bring to his team when it comes to the Six Nations. \nWho do you think will win the Six Nations?
