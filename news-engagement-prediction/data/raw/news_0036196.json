OK so I guess there is no way I can maintain my dignity AND clear my name, so fuck it. Here's what you've all been waiting to see.\" \nRoxx urged his followers to send the screenshot of his peen to the outlets who refused to retract the articles and clear his name. \nThe lawsuit, filed in March 2016, came after an April 2014 report claimed that Johnson was rushed to the hospital after cutting off his penis and jumping off his balcony. \nRelated: Usher Just Snapchatted A Dick Pic! \nHowever, the person who actually committed the self-mutilation act was another rapper affiliated with the hip-hop collective, Christ Bearer . (Who, BTW, later said he was proud of the surgery decision .) \nIn his lawsuit, Johnson alleged his association with the story has damaged his career, and \"has made it exceedingly difficult for Plaintiff to earn a living even outside of the music industry.\" \nBut the complaint was dismissed by a judge because it was filed after Pennsylvania's one-year statute of limitations expired. We guess in this case, the early bird gets the worm? \nAt least Johnson's name (and penis) is cleared in the court of public Twitter opinion. Feast your eyes on the evidence (below)! \nCase dismissed on a Technicality huh?No way I can maintain my dignity AND clear my name, so fuck it.
