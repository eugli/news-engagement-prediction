Who would believe this? Sweden,\" he continued. \"They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible.\" \nThe embassy of Sweden in Washington, D.C., promptly asked the US State Department for an explanation of Trump's comments that insinuated an attack had happened there on Feb. 17. \nThey tweeted: \"We look forward to informing the US administration about Swedish immigration and integration policies.\" \nAccording to ABC, the White House clarified Trump was referring to \"rising crime and recent incidents, in general,\" and not \"a specific incident\" in Sweden. \nTrump apparently spoke of a security incident that transpired in Sweden the night before the rally, which puzzled many Swedes. \n\"We have asked the question today to the state department. We are trying to get clarity,\" said Swedish Foreign Ministry Representative Catarina Axelsson. \nShe said her \"government wasn't aware of any 'terror-linked major incidents,'\" The Associated Press reports. \nSwedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom responded to Trump's reference to Sweden on Twitter with the comment \"owing to certain circumstances,\" and cited an excerpt of her speech read in parliament in mid-February on Swedish foreign policy, notes Business Insider. \nThe passage reads: \"In 2016, 'post-truth' was named Word of the Year by Oxford Dictionaries. Both functioning democracy and constructive cooperation between states require us to speak with, and not about, each other, to honor agreements and to allow ideas to compete. \n\"They also require us to respect science, facts and the media, and to acknowledge each other's wisdom.\" \nEx-Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt tweeted: \"Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound.\" \nTrump alluded to security attacks to Europe in his speech. \n\"You look at what's happening in Brussels. You look at what's happening all over the world,\" he said. \n\"Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris,\" he said as he pledged to keep the \"country safe.\" \nTrump's statements were rebutted by Twitter users including Chelsea Clinton. \"What happened in Sweden Friday night? Did they catch the Bowling Green Massacre perpetrators?\" she said in reference to Kellyanne Conway's factual slip in January.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:01:21.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
