Instead of $420 for an eight-hour shift, they would now get $360. \nOn public holidays, rates have been cut for fulltime and part-time workers have also been cut from 250 per cent to 225 per cent. Casuals will remain at 250 per cent for public holidays. \nIF YOU WORK IN FAST FOOD \nFulltime and part-time level one fast-food workers will have Sunday penalty rates reduced from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. \nLevel two and three employees will stay at 150 per cent. \nIF YOU WORK IN RETAIL \nFulltime and part-time retail workers will have Sunday rates reduced from 200 per cent to 150 per cent, while casuals will be reduced from 200 per cent to 175 per cent. \nAs in hospitality, fulltime and part-time retail workers have been cut from 250 per cent to 225 per cent, but casuals will remain at 250 per cent. \nIF YOU WORK IN PHARMACY \nSunday rates for pharmacy workers between 7am and 9pm will be reduced from 200 per cent to 150 per cent for fulltime and part-time workers. \nCasuals will be reduced from 200 per cent to 175 per cent. \nIF YOU’RE AN EMPLOYER \nEmployers in these industries are the ones who have been pushing for these cuts. \nThey say the penalty rates have hindered their business by making it too expensive to operate efficiently on the days that demand extra pay. \nBusinesses argue that, ultimately, this change means more jobs for Australians because they will be able to afford to give workers more shifts. \nIF YOU’RE A CONSUMER \nCould this be the end of public holiday surcharges? If restaurant and cafe workers are being paid less surely we shouldn’t have to charge more to cover their inflated wages on those days, right? \nWrong, according to Restaurant and Catering Australia chief executive officer John Hart. \nMr Hart says the restaurant industry is still waiting on a decision to change their award, and even if Sunday and public holiday rates were further lowered, they would still not meet the costs of staffing. \n“To be honest, the rates going down won’t alleviate the need for a surcharge on public holidays,” he told news.com.au. \n“At 225 per cent you’re still paying more than double time. As it stands at the moment, wages are nearly 50 per cent of turnover. Even with these changes you’re still in a place where there is an extraordinary amount of addition cost, which isn’t met by any sort of surcharge.” \nWHY IS THIS HAPPENING NOW? \nThe reform was one of a number of workplace recommendations made by the Productivity Commission last year. The FWC had been considering bids from business and employer groups to lower Sunday rates since 2015. \nA decision was expected at the end of last year but repeatedly delayed. \nWHEN DO THE CHANGES KICK IN? \nIt not clear when the Sunday pay rate cuts take effect. However, we know that the changes to public holiday rates begin on July 1. \nEarly and late night work loadings in the restaurant and fast food awards will take effect in late March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:37:58.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
