All images © Mats Gustafson This February marks the 70th anniversary of Christian Dior’s smash debut, at which he introduced the New Look. Curvy, soft-shouldered, and full-skirted, it was romantic and escapist—and completely different from the broad-shouldered, tailored look that came before it. Many more memorable silhouettes would be created at the house, by Monsieur Dior himself, as well as by his successors, who include Yves Saint Laurent, Marc Bohan, John Galliano, Raf Simons, and now Maria Grazia Chiuri, the first woman at the head of the maison. Since the Spring 2013 season, Dior, reviving the house tradition of working closely with illustrators, has been collaborating with Swedish artist Mats Gustafson. A giant in his field, this much-respected—and copied—illustrator has documented each collection in a series of drawings. Using his signature watercolors as well as cut-outs, Gustafson has captured the essence of the clothes. These drawings have now been collected in a glorious large-format book, Dior by Mats Gustafson (Rizzoli). In advance of its February 21 release, we spoke with Gustafson about Simons, the ’80s, and the role of illustration in fashion today. Tell us about your drawings of archival Dior designs. [Dior is] really proud and very protective of its history and the legacy of Christian Dior. It’s a part of the brand’s visual language. [My drawings are] based on old photographs. Sometimes a dress or look has become [famous] because of a well-known picture, and that’s the only thing I have to avoid. I really have to get to the clothes and see what they look like. What do you think made the New Look such a turning point in fashion? I think the big change was the hips, but also the shoulders, which had been enormous during the war, and [Dior] dropped that [and created] rounded shoulders and bare shoulders, and focused on the waist and the longer skirt. It must have been irresistible, I think. Someone who could define a new look after the terrible years of war; I think it was really to get away from the war. What did you think of Raf Simons’s work at Dior? I related to his aesthetic and his vision. Of course, he’s known for being minimal, but I guess in order to honor the house, he took that to heart and figured out wonderful things to do with the couture collections, [while] being true to his own minimal vision but also very respectful of the incredible labor that’s involved. I admired his serious take. Gustafson’s early work in Vogue . Illustrated by Mats Gustafson, Vogue, February 1985 Can you talk about the various techniques you use? [At the beginning of my career I did] more line-like drawings, with pastel chalks, but watercolor has been my primary technique since the late 1980s [when] I started to collaborate with Romeo Gigli. Things were changing at that time; he changed the rather aggressive ’80s [look] into something much more romantic and poetic. The silhouette changed, the attitude changed, there was a very different look, and I started to do more and more watercolors [that] suited that time and that softer, more sensual style. I’ve [also] always played with cut-outs because often I see fashion in a very graphic way. It depends on the look, but sometimes it’s something that you can reduce into surfaces or shapes. It’s a good way of quickly pinning down a look or shape. I’ve always used that, but it doesn’t always work; I think it takes a strong sense of shape and color. How did you become an illustrator? I always made drawings, but I never thought of studying fashion illustration. I was sure I was going to work in film or theater. [Gustafson has a degree in stage design.] During my studies, I had some drawings published in a Swedish magazine. H&M saw [these], and I started working with them. In the late 1970s, I showed my drawings to Grace Coddington, who at the time was an editor at British Vogue , and she commissioned me to do drawings for the following Paris collections. I decided to move to New York in 1980, and I’ve been working as an illustrator ever since. From the late 1980s all through the 1990s I worked with Italian Vogue . Dior has a history of working with illustrators. What do you think the role of illustration is today? Can it do things that photography cannot? I think [illustration] adds another way of looking at fashion. In my case, I’ve always [considered] how to reduce, how to make things simpler. I guess a camera cannot really work that process; you’re working with what you have. I can reduce and reduce and simplify. That is my drive. I have a more abstract way of working. [There’s also] the immediacy of the hand; when you sense that there’s been a hand doing something, you can’t replace that with anything—it’s so fundamental and primal in a way. Of course, it’s the vision that’s important and how we filter things, but I think that immediacy of a hand [is key]. Today we cannot just talk about photography and illustration; there are so many areas in between. I can only speak for myself, but I think that you have to understand and accept that the main way of communicating fashion is with photography. [Drawing] doesn’t compete with the camera, it just adds something totally different. It’s such a visual culture we live in and I think there’s a need for more and more and more, and there’s obviously room for illustration. It just feeds the hungry eye. People are rather educated visually today and I think that’s why a drawing can communicate.
