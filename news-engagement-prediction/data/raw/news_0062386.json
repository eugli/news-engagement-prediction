Militants had laid mines throughout the disused complex and were clashing heavily with advancing forces.

West Mosul’s narrow streets will make the going tough for armoured vehicles, meaning a lot of the fighting will need to be done house to house. Isis is known to have deployed dozens of suicide bombers along the approaches to city. British suicide bombing suspect wasn't being tracked by UK intelligence Read more \nA British jihadi, Jamal al-Harith, born Ronald Fiddler, is thought to have been among them and to have exploded himself in an area known as Abu Saif on Monday. \nAid organisations say as many as 750,000 civilians may still be in western Mosul. Mercy Corps’s country director, Su’ad Jarbawi, said: “We need to be nimble and ready to respond to the needs of the people wherever and however we find them. \n“In the battle for the eastern half of the city of Mosul we saw the overwhelming majority of civilians staying in their homes rather than fleeing. This was a marked departure from what we’ve seen in previous battles. However, we don’t yet know what civilians in the western side of the city will choose to do.” \nAs many as half of Mosul’s remaining residents are thought to be under 18, and 160,000 have already fled the west of the city for newly erected refugee camps to the south. Iraqi forces have detained hundreds of military aged men as they have fled, in an attempt to weed out any Isis members among them. \nIraq’s prime minister, Haidar al-Abadi, has demanded that troops be held accountable for any abuses. In the fight for the east of the city, relatively few allegations of abuse arose, with national police and soldiers winning the cautious trust of communities who, before the Isis takeover of Mosul in mid-2014, had been deeply wary of a secrecy order imposed by Baghdad. \nAdditional reporting by Cengiz Yar ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:15:21.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
