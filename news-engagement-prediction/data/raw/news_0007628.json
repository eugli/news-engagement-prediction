And the pair will work together again at least until the end of the season. \n\n\nA statement on Leeds' official website reads: \" Leeds United are pleased to confirm a second transfer deadline day signing, with Modou Barrow joining the club. \n\n\n\n\"The 24-year-old joins the Whites on loan until the end of the season from Premier League side Swansea City.\n\"The attacker will be unavailable for Wednesday's trip to Blackburn Rovers on Wednesday, but like fellow deadline day signing Alfonso Pedraza could make his debut in Sunday's West Yorkshire derby with Huddersfield Town.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old was born in Gambia, but moved to Sweden as a youth. He once received a call up to represent the Swiss national side, but could not deliver because of an unfortunate and untimely injury. \n\n\nHe has since decided to play for his country of birth, and has made five appearances for the Gambia national team so far. \n<section><h2>Who Is the Worst Ever January Signing in EPL History?</h2></section><section><h2>Andy Carroll (Newcastle United to Liverpool for £35m 2011)</h2></section><section><h3>Christopher Samba (Anzhi Makhachkala to QPR for £12.5m 2013)</h3></section><section><h3>Fernando Torres (Liverpool to Chelsea for £50m 2011)</h3></section><section><h3>Jean-Alain Boumsong (Rangers to Newcastle United for £8.3m 2005)</h3></section><section><h3>Konstantinos Mitroglou (Olympiakos to Fulham for £12m 2014)</h3></section><section><h3>Savio Nsereko (Brescia to West Ham United for £9m 2009)</h3></section>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:17:33.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
