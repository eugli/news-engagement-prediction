Federal officials also obtained an arrest warrant against him, accusing Valdez of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. \nEspinosa went missing on Dec. 29, 2015, after a fire damaged her home. She had moved in with Valdez, the father of two of her three children. \nHer remains were found more than two months later under a bridge on Dowdy Ferry Road in southeast Dallas. Espinosa's relatives immediately pointed fingers at Valdez, who they said had not been seen since Jan. 3, 2016. \nAuthorities suspect Valdez, 35, may have fled to Mexico. He is considered armed and dangerous. \nAnyone with information can call the FBI at 1-800-225-5324 or send a tip online at www.tips.fbi.gov. People can also contact your local FBI office.
