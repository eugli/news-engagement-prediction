(Dave Rossman Photo) Photo: Dave Rossman, For The Chronicle Image 54 of 54 Scenes from Drake's Ballet on Super Bowl Weekend 1 / 54 Back to Gallery The hustler with the black tray and white bottle caps sported a game likely played on sidewalks and street corners since the time of Christ.\nA fuzzy red ball, hidden underneath one of the three caps, got swapped around at a rapid, but discernable speed, and for just $2,000 there's a shot at winning $5,000 if you pick the cap with the ball. The man was good for it, too — he flashed a roll of bills at the most interested onlooker, then tucked the money back under his shirt as the glare of red and blue police lights threw dark silhouettes onto the wall behind them.\nCELEBS IN HOUSTON: Who was spotted and where\nEveryone stuck in the back half of the line outside Mercy Nightclub on Thursday night was looking for their own fuzzy red ball, their own special prize in a world of empty bottle caps. Though the cover charge was $40, many paid far more than $5,000 to have the perfect club experience on Super Bowl Weekend. Reserved tables for The Ballet — a \"New Dance Experience\" by the rapper Drake that melded strip club and night club aesthetics — ran up to $10,000 for 15 people, at $666 per person.\nBut at 12:36 a.m. on the Ballet's opening night, with more than a hundred still in line to see featured guest artists Migos and Houston native Travis Scott, the question wasn't where the party was but whether it would happen at all.\nMore Information 'The Ballet' at Mercy Nightclub\nWhen: 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Friday, Saturday and Sunday\nWhere: 1505 St Emanuel St .\nTickets: $75 - $10,000. Click here to purchase online.\nFriday Feb. 3: Young Jeezy, Lifestyle Specialist Kenny Burns and DJ Baby Yu\nSaturday Feb. 4: 21 Savage Live, Dj Esco Live, Odell Beckham Jr. and Dj Efeezy\nSunday Feb. 5: Gucci Mane, Lil Wayne, DJ Khaled and DJ Mr Rogers\nPlenty was happening outside the club, to be sure. Two women began their own dance party, one twerking with her palms pushed against the wall, the other supplying the music with her iPhone. But not for long.\nTheir date, a man who looked like he walked off of a hair gel commercial shoot with a long, thin scarf running down his blazer, had a section. As the man escorted the dancing women to the front of the line, a friend of his, or perhaps simply a loud and envious stranger, yelled out, \"Kevin got a section, y'all. Kevin got a section!\"\nTOTAL PACKAGE: W hat a $400,000 Super Bowl experience looks like\nSans a section, though, how does one get into The Ballet, which, along with Club Nomadic, is creating considerable buzz in a Super Bowl week throbbing with excitement? As the man with the white bottle caps and fuzzy red ball might point out, money talks.\nA few $20 bills, slipped clandestinely into the bouncer's palm — sweaty, strong grip, preposterously hefty — granted the privilege of pushing past the exasperated masses (\"Excuse me? Do you even know anyone in front?\") and into a cavern of blue lights, pounding bass drums and showers of single dollar bills.\nThe Ballet uses a technique employed by most European still life painters, which is to use a focal point to draw the eye to the center the same way a whirlpool does a boat.\nThe venue's focal point was a main stage featuring two to three female dancers on a giant glass table, bending and arching and spinning as a male attendant with a broom diligently swept up the dollar bills and deposited them into a trash bag — like leaves in autumn.\nThe dancers sported bright, outlandish bikinis and unitards, not to mention names like \"$equenta,\" \"Persuasian\" and \"Robyn Banks.\" The hostesses — those responsible for pouring Ace of Spades and Dom Perignon into the flutes of the high rollers — wore red low-cut swimwear displaying the word \"Dope,\" a reference to their self-appointed title as \"The Dopest Dolls in Town.\"\n(Story continues below.)\nWhat it looks like inside The Ballet, a \"dance experience\" by Drake at Mercy Nightclub in Houston Texas, on Thursday, Feb. 2, with featured guests Migos and Travis Scott.\nMedia: MediaOS Video Hip-hop trio Migos played more the role of backdrop than hype men, chiming in occasionally during hits like the Georgia act's song \"Bad and Boujee.\" Perched near the DJ in the far end of the room, they danced in front of a camera — supposedly for a music video or promotion — and threw dollar bills into the air. When gusts of mist and air blew down onto the stage, the bills flew high, then landed into the crowd, leaving the Dope Dolls to later pick up the soggy, stomped-on money.\nThe scene after 2 a.m. was loud but uneventful aside from a few lost phones and a loudspeaker from a police cruiser telling people to clear the street. Some waited for food from Hungry HeroZ, other called Ubers and limousines and ignored the ice cream truck parked on the back side of the club, which blared its nostalgic song into the night.\nAnd the hustler was back.\nHe asked participants to keep their eyes on the prize, to keep that focus trained on the red fuzzy ball, to never lose sight of what they came here for, which, really, could have anything that wasn't an empty bottle cap: Grey Goose to chug on top of a table, money to throw in the air, revelry, celebration, status, expense, posturing, beats, booze, self-worth, or even oblivion.\nBut not Drake. The Toronto rapper who considers Houston a second home was apparently nowhere to be found in his Ballet. The man who started from the bottom and now wasn't here nevertheless gave tourists and H-town natives alike plenty to Tweet home about.\nFor those left outside in the cold, and those sad about the night's overall Drake-lessness, they at least had that hope-affirming mantra, which the hustler surely knows but can also serve anyone with their eye on the prize: There's always next time.",
