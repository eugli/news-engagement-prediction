Picture: Supplied Is this the most expensive car parking in Australia? news.com.au February 22, 2017 7:34pm \nCOLES says it’s to deter commuters from taking advantage of parking at their new Brisbane store. \nBut with a $77 slug if you stay more than two hours, shoppers will want to hope they don’t get distracted stocking up and overstay their welcome. \nFierce debate has broken out over the parking limits at the new Coles store in the Brisbane suburb of Alderley thanks to the steep parking limits in its 220-space carpark. \nThe store opened last Saturday, and the associated carpark offers shoppers free parking for two hours. \nGo over that limit, according to signage at the centre, and the charge is $77. \nAt the heart of the problem is that the store’s location is directly opposite the Alderley train station, which has 86 spaces. \nAs one poster to Facebook page said “86 spaces likely only means 86 people. That’s only a couple of stops of the train”. \nColes Alderley store manager James Feslman told the Brisbane Times the parking is for Coles customers and the two-hour limit has been introduce to stop train commuters parking there to catch the train into the city. \nMaybe to stay on the safe side, shoppers should stick to the “12 items or less” line.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:42:50.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
