A shocking video of a Daesh suicide bomber blowing himself up near a gathering point of Syrian forces has gone viral. According to a news report by the Daily Mail, the Daesh bomber was unsuccessful in his mission as he wasn't close to any of the soldiers when the bomb blew up. The footage was shot in Raqqa. In the video, which was shared on February 14, we can see soldiers in front of a building, who suddenly rush behind a tank, perhaps after a warning of the enemy's presence. The Daesh bomber then appears and in a split second his bomb detonates. After the smoke subsides, it can be seen that no soldier was hurt in the attack. It is not known whether the bomb blew up accidentally or the bomber got nervous and hit the panic button at the last minute.
