tributes to her son after his birth in 2012.\nBut Adele 's 'A' inking on her neck appeared faded as she attended the Grammys in Los Angeles on Sunday night.\nThe singer - who ruled the roost with five wins on America's biggest night in music - had her hair swept up in a chic chignon, similar to the one she sported in 2013, when she first debuted the design.\nScroll down for video\nLighter: Adele's 'A' inking on her neck appeared faded as she attended the Grammys in Los Angeles on Sunday night\nBut the tattoo - in honour of her son Angelo - looked significantly lighter than it did four years ago.\nWhile it's unclear whether the star has had treatment to erase the design, it could have been a trick of the make-up artist's brush.\nTalking about her designs in 2015, it seems unlikely the star would take steps to remove them.\nShe said of Angelo: 'He's my paradise' - and has the word tattooed on the side of her left hand and her son's name on her right to signify his meaning to her.\nHard to see: While it's unclear whether the star has had treatment to erase the design, it could have been a trick of the make-up artist's brush - and could hardly be seen as she was presented Album of the Year by Celine Dion\nBig announcement: The star took her acceptance speech as a chance to reveal she had married her father's son Simon Konecki\nMake them green with envy like Adele wearing Givenchy Givenchy Haute Couture by Riccardo Tisci\nShop Givenchy at Farfetch\nBuy now\nBetween the BAFTA Awards and the Grammys, it's been a night full of amazing red-carpet outfits!\nOne of our favourite looks at the BAFTAs was The Duchess Of Cambridge in a beautiful Bardot dress by Alexander McQueen, but Adele is definitely the best-dressed at the Grammys in our eyes.\nHer gorgeous Givenchy dress hails from the autumn/winter '16 collection, although she's had it customised and added long sleeves. We love this olive shade on her and it's nice to see the talented singer mix things up on the red-carpet.\nShe often wears a bit of sparkle at awards and favours brands like Burberry (who designed the stage outfits for her recent tour), Jenny Packham and Valentino, but we're glad she's given Givenchy a go this time!\nAlthough Adele's exact dress isn't available to buy, click right to shop the current collection at Farfetch where there's plenty of gems waiting to be discovered.\nOr why not make them green with envy like Adele and try one of our tempting olive numbers below from Xtaren, AQ/AQ, MSGM and Alberta Ferretti!\n* PRICES MAY NOT BE AS ADVERTISED ...NOW GET ONE LIKE IT £77 Xtaren long sleeve maxi (now £61)\nBuy now\n£140 AQ/AQ Marvey dress (now £70)\nBuy now\n£865 MGSM Floral-print silk maxi dress\nBuy now\n£1355 Alberta Ferretti sheer printed maxi dress (now £948)\nBuy now\nTalking about her child, she added: 'He’s the love of my life and the light of my life, but he’s no one else’s apart from me and his dad.\n'So no one else can really relate to that. Also, all my fans aren’t parents, so they wouldn’t want to listen to that (on an album).'\nThe evening was certainly one of big announcements for the star - she confirmed she had married her son's father over Christmas.\nNamechecking Simon Konecki, she referred to him as her husband in her emotional acceptance speech for album of the year.\nThe 28-year-old songstress said 'Grammys, I appreciate it, the Academy, I love you, my manager, my husband and my son – you’re the only reason I do it.'\nSo much love: The British star planted a kiss on Simon, 42, before she headed up on stage\nTaking to the stage at the Staples Center in Los Angeles the 28-year-old said: 'Grammys, I appreciate it, the Academy, I love you, my manager, my husband and my son – you’re the only reason I do it.'\nLast month the British star was spotted wearing a band on her wedding finger but reps for the singer had 'no comment'.\nThe couple, who met in 2011, are parents to four-year-old son Angelo.\nAdele spent most of her time on stage gushing about Beyonce and the influence the Lemonade hitmaker has had on her career.\nSitting in the audience 'Queen B' teared up as Adele said: 'I can’t possibly accept this award, the artist of my life is Beyonce,'\nShe continued: 'The Lemonade album is just so monumental Beyonce so monumental and so well thought out and so beautiful and soul bearing.\n'All us artists adore you, you are our light.'\nAdele won five Grammys during the night and it was during her speech for record of the year that the singer slammed her estranged father.\nProud: The entrepreneur watched from the audience as Adele won her fifth Grammy of the night\n'All us artists adore you, you are our light': Adele reduced Beyonce to tears as she gushed about the Lemonade hitmaker\nFrom me to you: Tim McGraw gave Adele a peck on the cheek as he presented her with an award\nRaise it up: The stunned singer snapped her award in half to share with Beyonce\nSharing's caring: Adele's actions prompted widespread laughter\nWild: The moment certainly captured the attention of everyone in the room\nTa-da! Adele looked surprised that she was able to break the award in two\nHello and goodbye: The songstress waved to the star-studded audience\nEmotional: The star was clearly touched to win, her eyes close to tears\nShe thanked her team and longtime manager Jonathan Dickins, who she compared to her father but quickly followed up with a comment about her strained relationship with her actual dad.\n'Thank you to my manager because the comeback, as it were, was completely masterminded by him. And you executed it incredibly, and I owe you everything,' she told Dickins.\n'We’ve been together for 10 years, and I love you like you’re my dad. I love you so, so much. I don’t love my dad, that’s the thing. That doesn’t mean a lot.'\nIt was during her speech for record of the year that the singer thanked manager Jonathan Dickins and compared him to her father saying 'I love you like you're my dad'\nTears of joy: Despite all of her success, Adele was still overwhelmed to win\nAdele then clarified by saying 'I love you like I would love my dad'\nHands full: Adele cradled all five of her gongs backstage\nGreen with envy: No doubt many were jealous of Adele's haul\nFamous friends: Busta Rhymes congratulated the singer\nTeam effort: Ryan Tedder, Ariel Rechtshaid and Samuel Dixon celebrated Adele's Album of the Year win\nWell done! Grammy Foundation President Neil Portnow congratulated Adele\nDoubling up: The star raised her awards into the air\nCentre stage: The night very much belonged to Adele\nShe then clarified: 'I love you like I would love my dad.'\nAdele's father reportedly left her and her mother when the singer was three-years-old.\nThe songstress opened Sunday's 59th annual Grammy Awards with a rendition of her hit Hello.\nIt's a love thing: She flashed what appeared to be her wedding ring as she took to the stage in her Givenchy dress\nHappy: She seemed in perfect spirits as she waved to the crowd while on the stage\nShe then performed a stunning tribute to late pop icon George Michael, singing a slowed down version of his song Fastlove.\nDespite stopping halfway through and demanding to start the song over, the haunting performance earned Adele a standing ovation from the crowd.\nShe went on to scoop song of the year, record of the year, album of the year, best pop solo performance and best pop vocal album.\nAdele sang a stunning rendition of George Michael's Fastlove as a tribute to the late pop icon. The singer got a standing ovation after initially stopping abruptly and demanding to start again\nLongtime love: Adele and Simon (pictured in 2012) met in 2011 and are parents to four-year-old son Angelo\nGRAMMY AWARDS 2017 WINNERS Song of the Year\nBeyoncé, Formation\nAdele, Hello - WINNER\nMike Posner, I Took a Pill in Ibiza\nJustin Bieber, Love Yourself\nLukas Graham, 7 Years\nRecord of the Year\nAdele, Hello - WINNER\nBeyoncé, Formation\nLukas Graham, 7 Years\nRihanna, Work (feat.
