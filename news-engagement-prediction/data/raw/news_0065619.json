Each cart carries 100-200 kilogrammes of fish. \nAbout 100 goods trucks on both sides of the road were forced to pull over by the blockade. It caused a 3-kilometre long tailback stretching to the Aranyaprathet Municipality 2 Market. \nThe protesters demanded a return to the old rate. Thai officials insisted they would talk with them only after the road was reopened to traffic. \nThe vendors agreed and the bridge re-opened about 12.30pm. As of 5pm the talks were continuing.
