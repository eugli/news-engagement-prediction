Do not proceed if you haven’t watched Thursday’s episode of Grey’s Anatomy. Looks like Alex Karev isn’t headed to prison after all. Grey’s Anatomy resolved Alex’s ( Justin Chambers ) pending fate on Thursday’s episode, revealing that the embattled Grey-Sloan Memorial doctor won’t be spending any time behind bars and got his job back as a pediatric surgeon -- all thanks to an unlikely savior. \nJust as Alex was about to take the plea deal for beating up Andrew DeLuca ( Giacomo Gianniotti ), Andrew barged into the District Attorney’s office, dropping a huge bombshell: He was going to drop all the charges against Alex. Wait, but why the sudden change of heart? \nRELATED: 'Grey's Anatomy' Star Giacomo Gianniotti Dishes on Possible New Love Triangle It took a while for Andrew’s reason to come to light, and not shockingly, the decision had everything to do with Jo ( Camilla Luddington ) -- to spare her from any additional suffering -- and not to help Alex get out of what would’ve been a two-year prison sentence. The truth came out in a dramatic confrontation between the nemeses outside Grey-Sloan. “Jo’s been through enough. She doesn’t need to live her life being scared,” Andrew says angrily, after he confesses he knows exactly why Alex beat him to a bloody pulp: Jo. “I think she’d say she’s pretty good at taking care of herself,” Alex fires back, leading Andrew to question his intentions. \n“But should she have to?” Andrew asks. \nRELATED: Alex Ends Up in the Most Unexpected Place on 'Grey's Anatomy' If there was any doubt about Andrew’s burgeoning feelings toward Jo before, this exchange cements his growing connection with her. Case in point: Earlier in the episode, Andrew and Jo shared a brief moment in the hospital hallway -- and we’re just assuming there’s more where that came from. Complicating matters even more is Alex’s reunion with Jo in front of his doorstep. After being the last to find out that Alex was no longer under threat of going to prison, Jo embraces her ex with a hug before leaving. What does it all mean? Are they back on good terms? Was that a goodbye hug? Will Andrew make a move on Jo? \nWhile Alex got his position back at the hospital, Meredith ( Ellen Pompeo ) was suspended as head of general surgery for not going along with the new residency director, Eliza ( Marika Dominczyk ), prompting Miranda ( Chandra Wilson ) to put her on temporary leave. \nWho does Miranda tap to replace Meredith as interim head of general surgery at Grey-Sloan, the same hospital she’s part owner of? April ( Sarah Drew ). Guess no one truly is safe! \nRELATED: 'Grey's' Star Jessica Capshaw Talks Alex's Fate Last year, Gianniotti dished to ET about the possibility of an Alex-Jo-Andrew love triangle on Grey’s. “People keep asking, ‘Are they getting together?’ and ‘Is it a romantic thing?’ and it could develop into that, but right now it’s a friendship -- two people who are happy to have someone to talk to,” the Italian-born Canadian actor said at the time. “Alex might beat me up again if I go for his girl! So I would ask Andrew to tread lightly in that direction.” What did you think of the latest episode of Grey’s Anatomy ? Tell us in the comments below or on Twitter at @ETnow!
