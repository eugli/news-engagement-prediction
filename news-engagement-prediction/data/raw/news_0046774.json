Refinery 29 reports Emma Hulse, a 24-year-old woman who was five minutes into a freelance shift at London TV station, UNIT TV, when a manager fired her, saying she \"should be on a catwalk.” Yep.

Then, she got a weird text. \"Then my agent text me that I’m no longer required,\" she said. “I got there and spoke to the line manager and he asked me, ‘Are you a model? Are you not doing catwalks, why are you not at the front of house?’\" “I was wearing a lipstick but from my perspective I was not inappropriate. I was wearing a shirt and trousers. I really didn’t think I looked inappropriate,\" she added. Uh... “Maybe that company employs plain looking people and maybe if you don’t look that way they don’t take you, maybe I was a distraction,\" she continued, saying, \"within a creative agency you should be free to wear what you want.” The man who fired Hulse has since been fired himself, and the company said this isn't the first problem they've had with him. Shocker! Maybe they should've fired him the first time something like this occurred . Heads up, employers: Be the change you want to see in the world — or at least fire the shit heads who harass women. Follow Laura on Twitter .
