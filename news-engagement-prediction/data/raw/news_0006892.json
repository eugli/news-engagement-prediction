That was the last time his friend saw him,\" Ms Eather said. \nThe Brisbane electrician left Australia in August 2016 for the trip of a lifetime â€” travelling the US, Canada and South America. \nIn the week before his accident, Mr Eather had been travelling with a close group of friends through Antigua. \nHe had been staying at a hostel in Guatemala where he was volunteering. \nHis family describe him as a \"fun-loving and adventurous young man\". \n\"So many people love Michael. He is intelligent and witty, loves life and recently caught the travel bug and was keen to explore the world,\" a statement provided by his family said. \n\"He was very excited about his overseas trip and spent months planning it. \n\"Obviously, we are all feeling extremely distressed and anxious and we want to do as much as we can to ensure Michael is found and brought home safely.\" \nHis brother, Brendan Perret described his brother as \"witty\", \"outgoing\", and \"a ratbag\".
