While voting with the conservative wing on economic issues like Mr. Obama’s health care program, he has sided with the liberals on social issues like abortion and gay rights. He wrote the Obergefell v. Hodges decision that established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage across the nation — a case that he and other legal scholars believe will mark his place in the history books. Some refer to the current bench as the Kennedy court because of his influence, which is all the more reason that conservatives have been eager to replace him. Justice Kennedy has been silent about his plans, but it was widely noticed by his fellow justices and other court watchers last fall that he had not hired a full complement of clerks for the next term. Some thought he was slowing down when he did not teach last summer in Salzburg, Austria, as he has for many years. Another sign was his decision to schedule his reunion of clerks, normally held every five years, one year early. But after Mr. Trump’s election, Justice Kennedy moved ahead with hiring clerks and authorized the court spokeswoman to issue a statement meant to dispute speculation that he might retire. The statement said that he had not gone to Salzburg because of conflicting family plans but would return there in 2017, and that the clerks had wanted to hold the reunion early to celebrate his 80th birthday.

If Mr. Trump were able to replace her, it could be a sea change on the court. Yet even though she appears frail at age 83, Justice Ginsburg has made clear that she is determined not to allow herself to be replaced by a Republican, especially Mr. Trump. Given that, White House officials had their eye on Justice Kennedy in promoting Judge Gorsuch. Although the judge is certainly to his right on legal questions, notably on abortion, Justice Kennedy is fond of Judge Gorsuch and respects him enough to fly to Denver to preside over his swearing-in after he was appointed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit by President George W. Bush. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Senate Democrats, however, found plenty of reasons to object to Judge Gorsuch, and liberal groups plan to wage a vigorous campaign against his confirmation. But Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and his caucus will have to decide how far to take it. It is unusual to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee by requiring that 60 votes are needed for confirmation, but it has been tried before. When Democrats were in charge of the Senate, they made it impossible to filibuster lower court nominees but not Supreme Court candidates.
