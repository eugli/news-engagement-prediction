I'm here to swallow gum and take names,\" McCarthy/Spicer went on, referencing the press secretary's real-life admitted habit of chewing and swallowing copious amounts of gum every day.\nThe sketch touched on the controversial travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries, at which point the character began incorporating props to describe each word spoken. The pseudo Spicer pulled out a plug from a box to indicate \"power\" and a stuffed moose and lamb as he described what he called radical \"moose-lambs.\"\nThe show was hosted by Kristen Stewart, who joked in her opening monologue about Trump's tweets following her high-profile breakup with actor Robert Pattinson in 2012.\nRobert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again--just watch. He can do much better!\nâ€” @realDonaldTrump Baldwin's cold open skit referenced several diplomatic calls with world leaders, including German chancellor Angela Merkel, played by former Hillary Clinton impersonator Kate McKinnon, who asked about the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries.\n\"We had to do it because of that huge massacre at Bowling Green,\" said Baldwin/Trump. \"It was horrible, so many people died, but actually they're the lucky ones, because they don't have to see how bad The Apprentice has gotten.\"\nThe joke had a two-fold punch: it referred to the fictitious Bowling Green incident mentioned by Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway earlier this week during a news segment in an attempt to defend the administration's immigration ban. Conway later said she mis-spoke about the made-up \"massacre.\"\nIt also alluded to Trump's Twitter feud with current Apprentice host Arnold Schwarzenegger .\nCanadian singer Alessia Cara was SNL 's musical guest. Her debut performance on the show included Scars to Your Beautiful and River of Tears .", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsnl%2Fvideos%2F10154926483676303%2F&width=460&show_text=false&height=258&appId", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258640349872926720", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsnl%2Fvideos%2F10154926764436303%2F&width=460&show_text=false&height=258&appId", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsnl%2Fvideos%2F10154926588361303%2F&width=460&show_text=false&height=258&appId"], "published": "2017-02-05T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:25:42.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
