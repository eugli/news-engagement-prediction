But tickets on the scheduled 08.25 from Appleby to Skipton service cost the same as they would if serviced by modern diesel engines: £17 for the whole 70-mile journey, less with a railcard. The Peppercorn class A1 steam locomotive will run two return journeys each day until Thursday between Appleby and Skipton.

It advised customers to check the National Rail inquiries website for ticket availability. \nThere were still some reservable seats available for the 5.15pm Skipton to Appleby services on some days of operation, the rail operator said. But all services remain popular and there are no guarantees any customer will be able to board Tornado without a reservation. No standing is permitted.

We always knew that the first timetabled steam services in the UK for 50 years would be extremely popular, but the demand for tickets has been phenomenal. \n“Those who have pre-booked reservations will be guaranteed their place on the relevant service, but for those who have unreserved standard tickets access to the services will be on a first come, first served basis. We strongly advise those who want to travel to arrive early as there will be a formal queuing process in place.” \nThe £3m Tornado was completed in Darlington in 2008 after an 18-year build by a charity.
