Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports) 4 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSoon after the Atlanta Falcons blew their 25-point lead in an epic Super Bowl LI loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday, a report emerged that offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan told people close to the team: “I blew it.” \nOn Thursday, when Shanahan was introduced as the new head coach of the San Francisco 49ers, he essentially corroborated the account from WSB, an ABC television affiliate in Atlanta. \n“I remember every single play, and I will go over those for the rest of my life,” Shanahan said at his introductory press conference. “That’s kind of the life we live as coaches. It’s magnified in the Super Bowl, but that’s the case in every game. \n\"I was made aware of that report about an hour ago — and I don’t know that I used those exact words — but that sounds about how I talk. When you’re the coordinator of an offense or a head coach, you’re responsible for what happens out there. NFL rebuild rankings: Which teams are in best shape for next season? \n\"I did believe that we had a very good chance to win that game, especially at the end, and we didn’t get it done. When you use the words, ‘I blew it,’ I don’t look at it that way. I believe we missed an opportunity.\" \nAtlanta led 28-3 in the third quarter before allowing New England score 31 unanswered points, including the game-winning touchdown in overtime. From the time when there was 2:05 left in the third quarter — when Atlanta held a 28-9 lead — until the end of the game, the Falcons ran 17 plays. Only five of them were rushes. Shanahan's play selection has been criticized for not using Atlanta’s capable ground game to milk the clock. \n“We played that game like we played every game the entire year,” Shanahan continued. “I called plays in that game the way I called them the entire year. Doesn’t mean I’m always right. Doesn’t mean they always work. But I promise you, I always prepare as hard as I can. I always do what I believe is right with our coaching staff and the players, and you always live with the consequences. And, yeah, it’s going to be hard living with that loss. \n\"Every play that didn’t work, I regret, as always. But I can deal with it, because I can look in the mirror and know that I did what I believed was best at the time.” NFL mock draft 1.0: Where might Leonard Fournette and others land in 2017 draft \nShanahan was named the 20th head coach in Niners history Monday evening. He said Thursday that he “plans on calling the plays” for San Francisco and doesn’t plan on hiring an offensive coordinator. \nNew 49ers general manager John Lynch said quarterback Colin Kaepernick reached out to the team’s front office, but no decision has been made on his future. Lynch said he and Shanahan need time to fully evaluate the roster. \n“We committed to truly making it a partnership,” Lynch said of the working relationship he and Shanahan hope to build. \n“I think the roles as they are defined are reflective of that. I can tell you, Kyle has control of the 53 (game day roster), I have the 90 (offseason roster), free agency, and the draft. But in all of those, it’s written as subject to approval of the other guy. That’s the way we wanted it.” \n*** \nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes \nPHOTOS: Super Bowl LI Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
