In many cases, the “Can you hear me?” comes right at the beginning of the call (again, before you may even realize it isn’t actually a human being calling). The BBB recommends not responding and hanging up ASAP if you’re asked “Can you hear me?” or a similar question.\nFor those of you have received these calls and have answered yes, the good news is that there has yet to be any actual reported attempt at collecting money, or charges. The debunking website Snopes has a list of reports about the scam calls, and each case is said to have cost the scammed zero dollars.
