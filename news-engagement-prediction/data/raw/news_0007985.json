JILL CLEAVE/FAIRFAX NZ \nKarangahake School students Josh King, Naomi Laslett, Cody Richards and Elise Taukiri at the empty chrome station. \nHe said there was no sign of a break-in and police suspected an opportunist thief, who saw teachers at the school on the weekend, noticed a door open, strolled in and took them. \n\"There were another 14 books left untouched in a classroom right next door, possibly because there was a teacher in that room,\" he said. \nHe said Karangahake was not a wealthy community and they all work very hard to get the children what they needed. FAIRFAX NZ \nChromebooks are used more and more these days. \n\"I've been here 23 years and one of the first things to impress me was the community spirit. They are an awesome, generous, big hearted bunch of people who work hard for their kids. These books were provided by the hard work of the community,\" he said. \nThe school board, parent-teacher group and even the students themselves had run many fundraising events to purchase enough Chromebooks to ensure everyone was on the same learning page. \nStudent Josh King, 12, said his class designed the room specifically so they could use the books in it at the end of last year. \n\"We all put our ideas together and were really looking forward to getting to use them. I think it's pretty low stealing from kids,\" he said. Ad Feedback \nMorgan Culton, who is new to the school and would of been working with students and their Chromebooks, said it was a real shock that someone had walked into the classroom and taken these things from the children. \n\"I was all geared up for everyone to be using them from day one and now, for a few weeks anyway, it is back to pencils and paper,\" she said. \nPolice want to hear from anyone with information on the stolen Chromebooks. They can get in touch with Wayne Harper at Waihi Police Station or phone anonymously on Crimestoppers - 0800555111.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:52:59.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
