(Photo: JetBlue) \nJetBlue has unveiled its newest special paint scheme, rolling out the new livery on one of its Embraer E190s. \nThe “Blueprint” paint scheme is the first special livery JetBlue has applied to an E190. JetBlue says it's meant to showcase “the so-called ‘bones’ of the 100-seat aircraft,” which the airline describes as “the backbone of the operation in cities like Boston; Washington, D.C.; and San Juan, Puerto Rico.” \nThe Blueprint-painted plane – JetBlue’s 12th special livery – was unveiled in Boston and will fly on E190 routes throughout JetBlue’s network. JetBlue growth turns to Mint, non-NYC bases \nThe livery features three “signature” JetBlue colors. But, despite the seemingly simple color scheme, JetBlue says the Blueprint look “is one of the airline’s most intricate special livery designs and took nearly two weeks to paint at a facility in Quebec.” \nJetBlue further described Blueprint paint scheme by saying: “Drawing upon the styles of various aviation, nautical and space exploration vehicle cut-away diagrams, the JetBlue design team created a mechanical x-ray of sorts infused with some JetBlue fun.” \nElsewhere, JetBlue also unveiled a new tailfin design that it says it will be placed on several aircraft this year. The first plane sporting the new “Highrise” tailfin design debuted Monday at New York JFK. The carrier describes it by saying it “depicts the image of bright lights through window panes of city high-rises, is meant to reflect JetBlue’s growth and New York’s perpetual desire to reach for the sky.” The airline says the colors on the tailfins can be rearranged to create “slightly different” patterns on different aircraft tailfins. \nJetBlue's new \"Highrise\" tailfin design is shown on this Airbus A320, seen here at New York JFK on Feb. 16, 2017. (Photo: JetBlue) \nJetBlue’s latest special aircraft livery came in November, when the airline rolled out a special “RetroJet” livery. \nWhat made that livery unusual is that JetBlue is a relatively new airline, having inaugurated service just in 2000. Since JetBlue did not have a decades-old “retro” look of its own, the New York-based company came up with a look meant to evoke a look from the 1960s era of aviation. Posted!
