Some of you may be wondering what in the world Friends Day is and whether it's a legit holiday, and if it is, when it is, what it's about, and what are those friends videos Facebook is serving up. \nWell, Pocket-lint did a little digging to find out all the details for you. Pocket-lint/Facebook Facebook: What is Friends Day? \nFacebook deemed \"Friends Day\" a holiday to be celebrated every year. It’s unclear how the day first came about, as well as what it's actually meant to help with or intended for, but Facebook itself has been celebrating the day for the past two years. In 2015, CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained it as thus : \"Friends Day is a day to celebrate friends. It’s also Facebook’s birthday, but today isn’t about celebrating us. It’s about friendship. [...] Friendship isn't a distraction from the meaningful things in life. Friendship is what gives meaning to our lives. [...] Let's turn today into a day to celebrate a friend. # friendsday \" Facebook: When is Friends Day? \nFriends Day occurs on 4 February, which also happens to be the date Facebook was founded in 2004. Note that Friends Day is different from the official \"International Friendship Day\", recognised by the United Nations, and is marked as 30 July. Facebook: What happens on Friends Day? \nTwo days before Friends day, on 2 February, Facebook began celebrating the holiday early by serving up a video to the nearly two billion people who log in each day. The video shows a dancing, animated person made up pictures of the user and his or her friends. It therefore appears like Facebook changed the date to its so-called Friends Day without explanation.
