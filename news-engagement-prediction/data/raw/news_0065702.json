The disgraced TOWIE star, 27, admitted to enjoying a night of passion with another woman in a lengthy Twitter post, referring to it as a 'mistake' and calling himself a 'fool' in the process. 'I am utterly disappointed in myself for hurting such an amazing girl, she did not deserve any of the pain I have caused,' Lewis began the grovelling statement.

MailOnline has contacted a representative from Lewis for comment. Lewis' apology to his girlfriend saw him blame the cheating on alcohol and while all the allegations that came forward weren't correct, he understood that it didn't make up for his actions. 'It was a drunken mistake, a terrible thing I wish I had the courage to just admit my wrong doing so Marnie did not have to find out from these girls. 'A lot of stuff is lies': Bloor blamed the cheating on alcohol and while all the allegations that came forward weren't correct, he understood that it didn't make up for his actions 'I was with Marnie for the right reasons. A lot of the stuff that's been said is lies. That doesn't change the fact of what i have done.' Clearly having learnt from the mistake, Lewis finished off the post with: 'You all have the right to think badly of me. Today, I think worse of myself than any one you possibly can. 'Marnie is a great girl and I am clearly a fool of ruining what was something special.' Meanwhile, the 'heartbroken' Geordie Shore , 25, star took to Snapchat on Tuesday to reveal that she had attempted to call her beau 10 times on the night he cheated - with a 'gut feeling' something was wrong - and later 'smashed up her house' in shock at the revelation.

She claimed Lewis made several advances, telling the site: 'He was really pervy from the start.' Fuming: Marnie lashed out at her love rat ex Lewis, labelling him a 'f***ing scumbag' after he was caught cheating on her on Valentine's Day She added: 'There was loads of traffic and we were playing drinking games in the back – he was begging me to spit neat vodka in to his mouth.' When asked about his relationship with Marnie, Ammelia claims Lewis scoffed: 'It’s not like that, it’s just for the money. That’s why we stay together.' Taking to Twitter after the news broke Marnie wrote: 'Didn't really want the whole country to know but looks like that didn't last long . Happy Valentine's Day to me. U f***ing scumbag.' She also shared several crying emojis and posted: 'Wish I could fast forward the next month.'

After cheating on Marnie, Lewis took to Twitter the next day to gush about his night. During this time, Marnie claims she couldn't get hold of him 'I was filming Geordie Shore for three weeks with no contact with the outside world, no phone, so I haven’t been able to contact anyone. 'On Valentines night I was really upset, so I sent Lewis a lovely Valentine’s card, like three pages long.' The morning after, Marnie attempted to call her boyfriend but was confused to find he wasn't answering his phone. She said: 'I thought that’s weird as he was at Drake last night. I had this gut feeling. Then he finally answered hours later and told me he hadn’t had any missed calls and I thought \"that’s weird I’ve rang you 10 times.\" 'On the phone he was like \"oh my god baby I miss you so much, I cannot wait for you to come back to our home like it’s been so hard without you\"'. Genuine? Lewis reportedly said he was only with Marnie for business purposes and the pair had been making money off pretending to be in a relationship Clearly angry, Marnie revealed that Lewis sent a bouquet of roses to her in the Geordie Shore house as she continued: 'Talking to me literally as he’s leaving the hotel where he’s sh***ged this girl, I can’t actually get my head around it. 'From the minute I came out of Geordie Shore and got my phone back I got a message that told me what was happening and that there was a video going round. 'So obviously me and Lewis were over from that second.' No holding back: The starlet then took to Snapchat to share an emotional video in order to express her side of the story as she became emotional reflecting on the betrayal About her shock, she went on to say: 'I can't actually believe it. I cried, I screamed, I have smashed my house up. Every emotion - I'm still in shock.' Marnie wasn't able to have a clean break from the star, however, as she revealed that he had been borrowing her car whilst she was filming for the MTV show. She explained: 'What a mug. I should have mug written there, in fact he’s probably dropped the girl off in my Range Rover, I wouldn’t put it past him. The Only Way Is not from Essex! Marnie - who hails from Newcastle - previously claimed that their relationship was strained due to the long distance nature of it 'At this point I had only seen him in the car with the girls, I hadn’t seen it in the hotel room. 'So when he got to my house he swore down on his family’s lives that nothing else happened and he just dropped her off at his own house. 'Because I love him, well I loved him, I wanted to believe that tiny bit of hope that he was telling the truth that he just went home. 'Then he left and I’ve been crying all day long, really upset, but even maybe thinking maybe I could forgive him because he didn’t actually do anything in the first video.' Concerning: The morning after Lewis had cheated Marnie had a 'gut feeling' something was wrong and attempted to call him but was confused to find he wasn't answering his phone However, Marnie learnt the full extent of the incident on Tuesday evening, as footage of Lewis in bed with another girl began to circulate. The emotional star continued: 'Then tonight I get the worst feeling I’ve ever experienced when I saw the video of him in bed with the girl. 'I can’t actually believe it. I’ve cried, I’ve screamed, I’ve smashed my house up. Every emotion, I’m still in shock. 'I’ve never been cheated on until now, it’s the first time I’ve experienced what it feels like, it is awful, its horrendous. Driving her crazy! Marnie wasn't able to have a clean break from the star, however, as she revealed that he had been borrowing her car whilst she was filming for the MTV show 'The worst thing about this for me is that I literally I provide for Lewis, I have for practically the last eight months, I have literally done everything I can. 'Thousands, thousands he’s had out of me. Then he has the audacity to tell the girl that he’s only with me for the money. 'He also told the girl that he was going to pick me up on Monday but keep Friday and Saturday free to take her out. 'While he’s just living in the house that I paid for, driving round in my Range Rover he’s just kindly sh***ing girls on Valentine’s Day. 'I’ve literally just spent seven months of my life with an absolute phoney, a lying cheating scumbag.' 'Thousands': Marnie claimed she had been supporting the star for months and said that spending thousands of pounds on him was the worst thing she had done Marnie was surprisingly grateful to the girls he had cheated on her with, explaining: 'If it wasn’t for you girls I would have spent maybe another year with this guy and never know. 'The thing is there is only one thing I feel right now and that is probably anger, I’ve cried all the tears I can cry I don’t think I’ve got any left. 'I want to expose him for what he actually is and what he’s actually done. I want to say a massive thank you for everyone who is there for me and sending lots of support. It literally means the world. It makes me feel so good when I feel so low. 'Just sometimes these situations when you’re cheated on makes you feel like it’s something you’ve done but all the messages have made me realise that it’s not me, just boys can’t change.' Devastated: Marnie was close to tears as she opened up with her side of the story Lesson learnt: Marnie was surprisingly grateful to the girls he had cheated on her with, explaining: 'If it wasn’t for you girls I would have spent maybe another year with this guy' Referring to her former flame Aaron Chalmers, she added: ''Also one more thing, I’ve just did a 12 episode series of Geordie Shore with my ex boyfriend who I was quite serious with and I was able to keep my knickers on why couldn’t he? 'The thing is when you love someone it’s not a hard thing to stay faithful, I find it really easy to stay faithful when I love them but some people aren’t real, they’re fake and pretend that they’re in love with you when they’re really not. Sad.' MailOnline have contacted Lewis' representatives for comment. On a mission: Determined Marnie said 'I want to expose him for what he actually is and what he’s actually done,' as she continued to list the events of the evening Marnie first hinted the pair had split on Monday when she tweeted: 'Don't make eternal life long promises with a deceiver They wont change. And u always end up getting your [heart] broken'. Lewis was equally cryptic in his musings, writing, 'All good things...' The couple began dating in July after meeting in the Celebrity Big Brother house. Marnie - who hails from Newcastle - previously claimed that their relationship was strained due to the long distance nature of it. Devastated: Marnie revealed she had never been cheated on before and questioned why Lewis had been unable to stay faithful if she had managed it inside the Geordie Shore house Speculation of split was fuelled earlier this year, only to surprise fans by turning up to the National Television Awards together after rekindling their romance. However, there was trouble in paradise recently when the reality starlet was recently hit with accusations by her co-star Marty McKenna, who insisted Marnie had made moves on fellow cast member Aaron Chalmers. Marnie began an on/off liaison with Aaron when he entered the MTV show in 2014 and made things official last year - before the relationship yet again went down in flames. Back on? There was trouble in paradise recently when the reality starlet was hit with accusations she had made moves on ex-boyfriend Aaron Chalmers After meeting Lewis, the duo enjoyed a romance which persisted throughout her filming the fourteenth series of Geordie Shore in October - and she vowed she would never be unfaithful. Yet Marty's comments will no doubt stun fans as he claimed: 'She’s pure evil... She’s a fake, fake, fake person and I hate her, me. She were all over Aaron and trying to neck on with him while we were filming – all behind her boyfriend’s back.' The outspoken star insisted that Marnie's behaviour was even worse that that of notorious Lothario Gary 'Gaz' Beadle - who famously boasts of bedding thousands of women, while claiming he should have 'a degree in pulling'. Standing by her: Despite the accusations, Lewis stood by Marnie and posted a lengthy rant in which he defended her Lewis didn't appear to be fazed by the claims, however, and took to Twitter to share a lengthy post in which he tagged Marnie with a kiss emoji. It read: 'It's hard being the bigger person... You see shade being thrown at you and you have to ignore it, you hear the rumours they're spreading you have to refrain from addressing it, you see the slick posts and comments and you have to scroll past them like they don't exist. 'But you have to keep in mind that people only do things for a reaction... and believe it or not you are winning by doing absolutely nothing at all.. because they are so bothered by the fact you are unbothered. 'Let WHOEVER say and think WHATEVER... you just remain focused and keep getting BETTER. 'They have to talk about you... because if they talked about themselves no one would give a damn.'
