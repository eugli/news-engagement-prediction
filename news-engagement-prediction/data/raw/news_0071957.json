(Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for ) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  44 AM \nA man suspected of murdering rapper T-Pain's niece last summer has been found dead in Tallahassee, Fla., police say. \nLaw enforcement officials came across the body of Tavon Jackson, 25, in the woods Tuesday during an unrelated search in the area for a separate case, the Tallahassee Police Department revealed in a statement. \nThe department's Violent Crimes and Forensic Units have launched an investigation, but police officials say Jackson's death appeared to be a suicide. They noted the investigation remains in the early stages. \nPolice had been searching for Jackson since August in connection to the killing of 23-year-old Javona Glover, who was stabbed to death outside a West Tallahassee Walgreens store, where she worked. \nT-Pain, who was Glover's uncle, urged his followers to help police locate the killer after his niece's untimely death. Tavon Jackson has been found dead in Tallahassee. \n\"The police are still lookin for the coward ass n----r that just killed my niece at Walgreens in Tallahassee. If you got info pls help out,\" the rapper, whose real name is Faheem Rashad Najm, tweeted in August. \nAuthorities released three photos of the suspect inside the Walgreens shortly after Glover's death. \nJackson was Glover’s ex-boyfriend, according to the Tallahassee Democrat. \nGlover was the mother of a 2-year-old little girl.
