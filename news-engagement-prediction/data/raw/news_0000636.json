Of course.\" \nArsenal fans, who still have nightmares about the 6-0 drubbing suffered at Chelsea on manager Arsene Wenger's 1 000th game in charge in 2014, will be hoping that the Watford result has a similar galvanising effect. \nThe Gunners have not won at their rivals in the league since October 2011 but need to do it more than ever this time if a first title since 2004 is to be anything more than a distant dream this season. \nWenger will not be on the bench, with the Frenchman serving the third game of a four-match touchline ban for his sending off against Burnley, but he will have had plenty to say to his players. \nGoalkeeper Petr Cech, returning to his old surroundings, is sure to be pepped up already as will Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, whose tally of 15 goals currently tops the league scorers standings with Chelsea's Diego Costa. \nBut Arsenal will need to be fully switched on, mentally as well as physically, to crack a defence that has conceded just 16 goals in 23 matches. \nAnd there are those who doubt Arsenal's ability to put it all together in what could be their toughest test. \n\"Even Wenger must concede they need a miracle to win the Premier League now,\" commented old foe and former Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp in a column for the Evening Standard. \n\"They have to beat Chelsea on Saturday to have any chance, but the players must be at an all-time low after losing to Watford, who had one win in nine games before Tuesday. \n\"Their defending for both goals against Watford was shocking and it just makes me think even more that Arsenal's back four is not up to the level needed to win the title.\" \nWenger has given his players two days rest ahead of the clash, according to media reports. The Gunners will be without injured midfielder Aaron Ramsey and have striker Olivier Giroud doubtful with an ankle knock.
