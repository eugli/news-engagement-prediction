(AP) — Officials have ordered residents near one of the nation’s biggest dams to evacuate the area, saying a “hazardous situation is developing” after an emergency spillway severely eroded. EMERGENCY EVACUATION: Auxiliary spillway at Oroville Dam predicted to fail within the next hour. Oroville residents evacuate northward. \n— CA – DWR (@CA_DWR) February 13, 2017 \nThe emergency spillway of the Oroville Dam in Northern California could fail within an hour unleashing uncontrolled flood waters from Lake Oroville, the California Department of Water Resources said on Sunday afternoon. \n— Judy Brandt (@judywbrandt) February 13, 2017 WATCH: Drone footage of the emergency spillway in Oroville. #OrovilleDam #OrovilleSpillway pic.twitter.com/CEDN1t0dj8 \n— KRCR News Channel 7 (@KRCR7) February 11, 2017 \nPeople in downstream areas need to leave the area immediately, the department said. \nOfficials earlier Sunday stressed the dam was structurally sound and said there was no threat to the public. \nResidents of Oroville, a town of 16,000 people, should head north toward Chico, and other cities should follow orders from their local law enforcement agencies, the Butte County Sheriff’s office said. \nThe Yuba County Office of Emergency Services asked residents in the valley floor, including Marysville, a city of 12,000 people, to evacuate and take routes to the east, south, or west and avoid traveling north toward Oroville.

Flows through the spillway peaked at 12,600 cubic feet per second at 1 a.m. Sunday and were down to 8,000 cubic feet per second by midday. \nWater began flowing over the emergency spillway at the Oroville Dam in Northern California on Saturday for the first time in its nearly 50-year history after heavy rainfall. In this Saturday, Feb. 11, 2017, water flows down Oroville Dam’s main spillway near Oroville, Calif.

Engineers don’t know what caused the cave-in, but Chris Orrock, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, said it appears the dam’s main spillway has stopped crumbling even though it’s being used for water releases. \nAbout 150 miles northeast of San Francisco, Lake Oroville is one of California’s largest man-made lakes, and the 770-foot-tall Oroville Dam is the nation’s tallest. The lake is a central piece of California’s government-run water delivery network, supplying water for agriculture in the Central Valley and residents and businesses in Southern California. \nEditor’s note: Story by the Associated Press; curated by Chris Enloe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:47:16.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
