Caroline Foskett, 31, was shopping in the Aldi in Dartford, Kent, on Friday when she spotted a man wearing a Domino's uniform 'awkwardly wandering up and down the aisles' with a trolley. The man appeared to be waiting for Aldi staff to restock the freezer after he had emptied it of chicken wings and dippers. Teacher Ms Foskett, from London , claims he already had six or seven tubs of coleslaw, eight or nine boxes of chicken strips and the same same amount of chicken wings before he loaded in even more. The mother-of-two sent the fast food giant a photo of the worker when she saw Domino's hit the headlines last week after staff were spotted bulk-buying £1 bags of potato wedges in Asda. However, Domino's claimed the member of staff was conducting his personal grocery shop because bottles of water are visible in the trolley, which they don't sell. Ms Foskett said: 'No-one needs that much chicken for themselves.

I thought \"as if they're doing it again\". 'We used to get pizzas on the weekend because my husband works then and we'd spend well over £20, but now I'm not so sure. 'He certainly looked a bit sheepish, like he was trying to be very discreet.
