All services were restored by 5.35am. \nPower was cut at 1.40am \n\"The Malta-Italy Interconnector and all local electricity generation sources at Marsaxlokk were shut down as a result of this difficulty,\" the company said. \n\"First emergency plants at Delimara Power Station were switched on within an hour and supply to customers started gradually being restored at 3.10am. Enemalta and its contractors also dispatched engineers to the Malta-Italy Interconnector Terminal at Ragusa to assist as necessary. \n\"The Maltese electricity network, including connection to Sicily through the Interconnector, was subsequently energised as soon as the necessary capacity became available. All areas were reconnected gradually to avoid damaging the national electricity infrastructure.\" \nIng. Fredrick Azzopardi, Enemalta chairman, thanked the management and the employees who did their utmost to restore supply to all customers in the shortest time possible whilst minimising the risk of damage to the electricity generation infrastructure and the national electricity grid. \n\"Enemalta plc is investigating the cause of the incident, to identify any measures that may need to be taken to avoid similar disruptions,\" the company said. \nIt regretted any inconvenience to its customers. \nThe last major blackout was on January 16, when much of Malta was left literally in the dark due to what Enemalta said was a power cut in Sicily that affected the undersea interconnector. \nEnemalta is currently carrying out tests before commissioning the new gas power station at Delimara. Gas was delivered to the facility on January 11. « PN amendments to power of attorney rules defeated in parliament Malta newspapers review » Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=70844788243&n=67b47d4c' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=70844788243&n=67b47d4c' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:30:04.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
