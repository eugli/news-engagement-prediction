Where they go \nYou will have read - and you will probably have used as a punchline or explanatory prop for American parochialism - the fact that “the majority of Americans do not have passports”. This is true. The US State Department estimates that there are 119 million valid US passports in circulation, which would cover 37 per cent of the population. (The number with passports has doubled over the past decade, suggesting that George W Bush did more for opening up the country than originally thought . What effect The Donald will have on American travel plans remains to be seen - though his failure to visit his own wife’s native country for more than a few hours may herald a new era of staycationism.) California is the top pick for American holidaymakers Credit: ALAMY \nSo, the majority of Americans travel in… America - California, Texas, Florida and New York are most popular, in that order. \nBut do not be deceived by the relatively low percentage of US passports holders. For the 37 per cent that do have passports use them - and frequently. One in five of all long-haul travellers has a US passport (perhaps not hard when you’re geographically isolated). \nFor Americans, the most popular international destination - by far - is Mexico , where they find plenty of beach resorts, from high end to low, and lots of culture, great food and vegan yoga retreats. Their top foreign destination is Mexico Credit: xabi_kls - Fotolia \nFollowing the neighbourly trend, Canada is the second most popular destination, with Britain (mainly London) making an appearance at distant third. Britain still sees around 2.5 million American tourists each year. \nSince shortly after the Mayflower set sail, Americans have been making the return trip to Europe for a spot of culture. Picture Henry James’s American abroad and you’ll see that - in the best possible way - not much has changed: there’s a wide-eyed and worshipful innocence to the US visitor, who is as intent as any Japanese tourist on soaking up the culture of the Old World. \nIt is little surprise, then, that Western Europe is the next most popular region for US tourists, followed by Caribbean countries and East Asia . What they like to do \nIs it famous? Americans are there. You won’t find many of them toottling around Puglia or or Slovakia. They quest for not for the hidden gem, but for the best. Head to the Amalfi Coast or St Tropez, Paris or Rome, and they’re there, front and centre - you can hear them from a mile off. They may be coming in search of their family roots - in which case, you’ll hear plenty about that, too. Watch | An insider's guide to Rome 01:38 \nAmericans are list-tickers; with less holiday time than Europeans, they’re a people on a mission, and they don’t want to waste time. In Beijing, they’ll “do” the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven and the Summer Palace - and all in one morning. In the afternoon, it’s the Great Wall. How they behave \nAmericans take their manners and their travel seriously - particularly when compared to Britons. Wine? Cocktails? Yes, if thematic, but not to excess. \nLike Britons, their stabs at the local language will be unintelligible stabs in the heart of any purist. But it's an A for enthusiasm. \nAs travellers, they’re also fairly big on respect, of the loud and proud Aretha Franklin variety - as tourists, they’re not there to occupy, they’ve come to learn and engage. And to call you sir. Even if you have no title. \nSafety, space and hygiene are the top concerns. This is the nation that put Purell on the map. \nAnd Americans are highly adept at complaining. Grin and bear it? But why? Ridiculous complaints made by holidaymakers What they wear \nSneakers, naturally. Which is a funny name, as they most definitely do not sneak up on you. But this spongy footwear, beloved of old and young, and in a variety of sporty or fashion-y iterations, does contribute to another distinct Americanism: the cheerfully bouncy walk. Another distinct Americanism? The cheerfully bouncy walk \nBeyond comfortable footwear - even paired with that mainstay of American manhood, chinos and a navy blazer - they do like to outfit themselves thematically. \nOn a safari with Americans? They’ll be in head-to-toe khaki. Skiing (which, of course, they do in North America, because it’s the best)? The gear will be unparalleled. Swimsuits offer maximum coverage - health concerns are always a high priority. \nSpeedos are strictly for the Olympic Games and are highly suspect in any family environment. Anything for the summer is monogrammed. \"On a safari with Americans?

Check (but my goodness, it’s greasy!). A bellini at Harry’s Bar in Venice? It has to be done. Which way to Harry's Bar? Credit: fischers - Fotolia \nBut andouillettes in Lyon? No way. And probably also not lamb. Or octopus. Or veal (how sad!). And what’s a quail, again? Look, basically just chicken and steak. \nWater, even in Italy, must come in a bottle - Americans, as a rule, do not trust the taps anywhere outside of the continental United States. How to get along with them \nDo ask: Where did you go to university? They love to answer this. Especially the young ones. \nDon’t ask: Who did you vote for? Too divisive and, either way, you’re in for a long lecture - possibly including “facts”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T12:47:42.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
