But Shkodran Mustafi launched a crude foul to try and take out Hazard, got himself booked and in the process made Chelsea’s No10 angry. \nAnd rather like with Bruce Banner, Arsenal didn’t like Hazard when he was angry. Short of turning into the Incredible Hulk, the Chelsea forward did everything else to terrorise and bully Arsenal as well as scoring one of the goals of the season. \n“Yeah, it’s true. It motivates me. When I get a lot of kicks, I feel really in the game,” said Hazard. “When people don’t touch me, that means I’m not doing well. I’m no good. Look, I’m not saying I like to be kicked, but it’s good for me to be in the game. \n“I try to be this kind of player. The type who does something when he gets the ball. In all the moments I get the ball I try to do something. \n“Sometimes in the past, for 20 or 30 minutes, I’ve not touched the ball in some games. These days I try and get on the ball, try and have lots of touches, and play my football for 90 minutes.” ALSO READ: Mourinho taunts Chelsea in style wars \nHazard was sensational, out of this world. At times, you felt as if the referee should give him his own ball to play with while the rest used another. Hazard’s individual skill, control and movement was mesmerising. \nChelsea were far better than Arsenal. The first half was competitive even after Marcos Alonso’s controversial opener put Chelsea ahead, Arsenal fought back well. Gabriel and Mesut Ozil could have equalised. \nBut the second half was one-sided, men against boys. Hazard’s goal after 53 minutes was a breathtaking solo effort as he took up the ball from halfway line, beat Francis Coquelin, Laurent Koscielny, dribbled into the box and then fired past Petr Cech. \n“It was one of the best I have scored, yes. You, the journalists and the fans, have to choose. But of this style of goal, it was one of the best I’ve scored,” said Hazard. \n“But I scored one with my left foot in the Europa League, against Manchester United in the cup. I’ve scored a couple of good goals. But it’s always good to score this kind of goal in a big game, and this was a big game.” \nHazard is, without doubt, a big game player. Two years ago, Hazard was Chelsea’s best player, won the player of the year gongs as they romped home to the title. But it was around this time of year in 2015 that former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho shut up shop, went back into his shell and Chelsea edged across the finishing line to win the Premier League. \nChelsea boss Antonio Conte has built his team on the foundations of a strong defence but even at 2-0 up, they went in search of more and Cesc Fabregas was gifted a third by Arsenal keeper Petr Cech’s terrible clearance. Olivier Giroud headed a late consolation. \nThey are now nine points clear at the top but Hazard made it clear they do not want to just sit back. Chelsea are determined to get even stronger and finish the campaign in real style. \nHazard said: “I want to say, against Liverpool, it was a little bit the same. We sat back and waited to get the ball. I think we have to play in this kind of situation as we did this time, in every game. \n“We have the players to do that. We don’t want to sit back, sit deep, and wait on the counter-attack. We have the players to get the ball, play with the ball, and we need to use this more. \n“We’re in better form, as a team. Not just me. Two years ago I was on fire, you know. But maybe I can score more goals this season. I already have 10. Two years ago I finished with 13 or 14. We have a lot of games to play, so we will see. \n“We are in a good place. We are in first place, and we want to stay first for three months. We want to give the trophy to the fans. But, in football, you never know. It’s not always the same story. \n“You can lose games, our opponents can be with more confidence than before and win games. We still have a lot of games to play. But I hope we can still be champions.” \nHazard can go down as an all-time Chelsea great. And some clearly think he is already on his way to greatness. \nChelsea owner Roman Abramovich walked through the tunnel nearly an hour after the game finished. Andriy Shevchenko was among his entourage and with him was his son, wearing a Chelsea shirt with Hazard No10 on the back. Now that’s praise indeed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:45:07.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
