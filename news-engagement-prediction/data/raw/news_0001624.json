CIBC Economics \nThe report, titled “On the Quality of Employment in Canada,” was part two of a study published in November . \nThe conclusion? Quality jobs in B.C. and across Canada have been steadily disappearing over the past 20 years, deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal wrote. \n“Is the quality of employment in Canada in decline? We think so,” he said. \nWhen Tal talks about “quality employment,” he means higher-paying, full-time jobs. \nThe first part of his note said part-time work as a share of total employment has grown since the financial crisis. Low-paid full-time jobs are also growing faster in low-paying sectors than they are in high-paying industries. \nThis chart shows that full-time paid employees have been growing faster in low-paying sectors than high-paying ones since 2003. CIBC Capital Markets \nTal arrived at this conclusion by looking at indicators such as part-time vs. full-time work, self-employment vs. paid employment and the compensation of full-time jobs in over 100 industry categories. \nAnd B.C.’s employment quality is worsening faster than anyone else’s, when you consider below-average wage work as a share of employment. \nTal found that the share of workers being paid below the average wage in the province grew from 48 per cent in 1997 to 60 per cent in 2015, for total growth of 12 percentage points. \nThe average wage in 1997 was $16.91 per hour. In 2015, it was $24.98. \nB.C. doesn’t have the highest share of workers making below-average money — that’s Quebec, where 66 per cent of workers made below the average wage of $23.56 in 2015.
