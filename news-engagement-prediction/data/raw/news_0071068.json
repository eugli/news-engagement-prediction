I don't see why anyone would want to harm him. \n\"I'm absolutely heartbroken and disgusted that a human being could be so incredibly foul and cold-hearted.\" \nScott was now warning pet owners on Brian Cres or nearby to be aware someone was taking potshots at animals in the area, and hoped karma would catch up with the shooter. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:07:15.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
