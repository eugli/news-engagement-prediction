He added: ‘People love Prosecco and the quality has increased. They want to know more and more about it. ‘We want to explain and educate the customers, but Prosecco pancakes are also about having fun and an experience you can recreate at home’. Prosecco pancakes are among several alternatives to the traditional honey and lemon or syrup toppings. Other outlandish recipes touted for Shrove Tuesday this Tuesday include beer and brown sugar, tawny port and banana, or gingerbread. Some suggest Expresso pancakes or topping them with mango slices and lime syrup. Pancake Day, as it’s also known, marks the start of the Catholic season of Lent. Nino Caruso, co-founder of Veeno wine cafe, said: ‘We want to explain and educate the customers, but Prosecco pancakes are also about having fun and an experience you can recreate at home’ Before abstaining from treats and giving up sweet things for Lent, Christians would traditionally ‘use up’ all the leftover and sinful ingredients in the form of pancakes. The Prosecco trend gained pace around four years ago and has showed no signs of slowing. Recipe: Serves One For the pancakes: 225g plain flour 2 tsp baking powder 284ml buttermilk 2 eggs 4 tbsp prosecco For the syrup: 150g sugar 150ml prosecco For decoration: Clotted cream Strawberries Method 1. Add the pancake ingredients to a bowl and beat until smooth. 2. Rest for one hour then pour an ice-cream scoopful into a hot frying pan and cook both sides. 3. Add the ingredients for the syrup to a saucepan and bubble for three minutes. 4. Stack the pancakes, add clotted cream and strawberries, then pour over the syrup. Add sparklers for an extra flourish. A Prosecco drought in the Italian region in 2015 even led to consumers ‘stockpiling’ bottles for summer. And at Christmas some supermarkets imposed a maximum number of bottles per customer. Several food and drinks retailers rushed to capitalise on the thirst for Prosecco flavoured products. Last summer Ocado launched a range of Prosecco ice pops while in winter Aldi sold Prosecco flavoured tea. And as well as an abundance of fizzy chocolates, sweets, and popcorn, there are also several Prosecco flavoured lip balms, soaps and ‘perfumed oils’. The drink is now spilling its way into everyday recipes, such as one for Chicken casserole with Prosecco and shallots. The UK export manager of Prosecco producer Ca’ di Rajo, said in 2015 that he expected the Prosecco trent to surge for at least ‘another ten years’. Veeno wine cafe has ten outlets in cities in the UK, offering four types of Prosecco on its wine menu. The chain sells Italian wines produced in the Sicilian family vineyard of Mr Caruso.
