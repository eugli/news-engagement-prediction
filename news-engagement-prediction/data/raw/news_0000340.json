A hotel room. A vision beyond football. \nAll those factors led Peyton Manning to choose the University of Tennessee 23 years ago and ultimately become the Vols’ most decorated football player in the program’s history. \n“It was certainly a new place for me. I’d never been to a Tennessee game and really didn’t know a lot of people up there,” Manning said on UT’s live stream. “I think everybody just assumed I was going to Ole Miss and really think certain schools didn’t recruit me as hard. My dad (Archie) told me, Son you’re 18 years old; go where u want to go. I’ll answer any questions for you. \n“I appreciated my dad’s advice to let me make my own decisions. Coach (David) Cutcliffe started recruiting me, then Randy Sanders who’s now at Florida State and then Coach (Phillip) Fulmer came to my house in Dec, and I was intrigued by the opportunity to possibly be a three-year starter at Tennessee and could possibly play three years. I ended up playing eight games my freshman year, Fulmer and I hit it off, Cutcliffe and I hit it off. Great visit. There was an ice storm, couldn’t really get around. So I had a great visit with a lot of people there. \n“I remember just saying if this football thing doesn’t work out for me, can I be happy at this school? Can you be happy in a school if football doesn’t work out because of the people around you? I can say that about the University of Tennessee. One of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I think that just shows how much I loved the University of Tennessee. I didn’t want to be 50 and wonder what my senior year would have been like.” \n(What's next for the Vols?   Manning also recounted his prowess in peer recruiting, but he did share a tale of one tremendous player who got away --- and one who Fulmer said was key for Fulmer to keep his job. \n“Chad Clifton, I’m pretty sure Fulmer said if this kid goes to Alabama I’m going to lose my job,” Manning said, then retold the story of driving through the night from visiting his girlfriend-now-wife-Ashley at the University of Virginia. “Coach Fulmer said this is the best wideout I’ve seen. I drove all through the night, and it turns out it was Randy Moss . I gave Randy my best shot; it didn’t work out.” Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:56:10.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
