Yes, we all knew a character was going to die. If you read the comics, you knew that it was somebody you really liked. But somehow the showrunners made it so much worse. \nThe premiere was about as pleasurable as going to the dentist, a seemingly unending reel of torture porn that went on and on and on as Negan broke Rick down to a helpless wreck who wanted only to serve him.
