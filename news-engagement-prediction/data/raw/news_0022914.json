The Mopar '17 Dodge Challenger makes its official debut at the Chicago auto show.\nResearch 2017 dodge challenger See Full Specs See Pricing Arriving in dealerships during the second quarter of this year, the Mopar Challenger comes with special badging, body colors, performance parts, and other upgrades. Buyers can choose one of the following two-tone color schemes: Pitch Black/Contusion Blue and Pitch Black/Billet Silver. Mopar will build 80 copies of each version, honoring the 80 years Mopar has been in business.\n© Motor Trend Staff 2017 Dodge Challenger by Mopar front rear side Instead of the usual chrome exhaust tips, the special Challenger receives a SRT Hellcat black exhaust. Dodge gave the Pitch Black treatment to the Mopar Shaker Hood and the rear decklid spoiler, also blacking out the Mopar Design badge. The model also benefits from 20x9-inch aluminum wheels with semi-gloss accents and center caps with the Dodge logo.\nAll Mopar '17 Dodge Challengers are based on the Challenger R/T 392. Accordingly, they receive a 6.4-liter 392 HEMI engine paired to a six-speed manual transmission, delivering 485 hp and 475 lb-ft of torque. A Mopar cold air intake, silver powder-coated Mopar Shaker strut tower braces and caps, and four-piston Brembo brakes are part of the deal.\n© Motor Trend Staff 2017 Dodge Challenger by Mopar front end Perhaps the most individualized part of the Challenger is the 80th anniversary plaque under the hood that announces the production number of the model out of 80.

Customers also get a Mopar '17 Owner's kit that includes Mopar valve stem caps, a special keychain, vehicle \"birth certificate,\" and a signed Mopar '17 rendering from FCA's design office.\nPriced at $56,885, the Mopar '17 Dodge Challenger will be available at select dealerships early in the second quarter of 2017.\nSource: FCA\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook & Twitter\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/challenger/2015/2015-dodge-challenger-srt-hellcat-first-test/", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MSNAutos", "http://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/challenger/", "https://www.facebook.com/MSNAutos", "http://www.motortrend.com/news/mopar-brand-turns-80-years-old-will-celebrate-special-models/", "http://www.motortrend.com/"], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:40:08.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
