Rick Snyder both determined that population growth is a key metric by which to judge their administrations. Duggan has often said his administration should ultimately be judged on Detroit's population growth, noting that he won’t have done his job if the city doesn’t start growing again. \nLast month, Snyder’s State of the State address concluded with, “We need to grow Michigan. We need to grow our population.” In fact, he set a goal to return our state’s population to 10 million residents, a growth of 71,000 in the next three years. Snyder also touted Michigan’s growth of 50,000 new residents over the last six years. Truth is, immigrants account for all of that population growth. \nNeither Duggan nor Snyder will be able to achieve their goals without immigrants . Evidence suggests that immigration serves as the critical driver of our population turnaround and that immigrants can help Detroiters revitalize their neighborhoods and Michigan households boost their incomes. \nPopulation growth is a sign that Detroit and Michigan are attractive places to live, with good-paying jobs, rising incomes and all the other amenities that attract or retain residents. Growing population inherently creates more demand for goods and services and more tax revenues, and contributes to job, income and wealth growth of existing residents. Stemming Detroit's population loss \nWhile by many metrics, Detroit has been improving, unfortunately, it has continued to lose population since 2010, albeit at a slower rate. From 2010 to 2014, Detroit lost 35,991 U.S.-born residents (or 5.3% of its U.S.-born population), but gained 4,362 new immigrants (or 12.7% of its immigrant population). As a result, immigrants now make up 5.7% of the city’s population, a gain of 17.8% in just five years, which has significantly helped stymie overall population loss. \nThis narrative is true in America’s greatest cities. Between 1960 and 1980, 29 of the nation’s 50 largest cities lost population. At least 15 of those cities were able to rebound and reverse decades of population loss into more recent growth. No American city has been able to reverse population loss without significant immigration growth. \nIn metro Detroit, we are seeing immigrants helping to stabilize neighborhoods, from those in southwest Detroit to Banglatown, a Bangladeshi, African-American and Yemeni neighborhood that straddles the Hamtramck-Detroit border. They are providing new retail opportunities in underserved neighborhood commercial districts, rehabbing vacant housing and preventing the continued decline of several Detroit neighborhoods. \nSalvador Enriquez is one of the entrepreneurs. Originally from Guadalajara, Mexico, Salvador was trained as a butcher at age 9 and developed a passion for providing high quality products to his customers. When he moved to Detroit in 1999 he promptly noticed a missing market – an opportunity, and one he knew well – not a single butcher shop throughout southwest Detroit. Three months later, he opened his first location in the Springwells neighborhood, and last year Carniceria Guadalajara was awarded a 2016 Motor City Match grant and an NEIdeas $10k Challenge grant to use towards expansion. Now a thriving butcher shop, Carniceria Guadalajara has not only filled a need in the community, but has added to the vibrancy of a busy and thriving neighborhood. \nRead more:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:27:31.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
