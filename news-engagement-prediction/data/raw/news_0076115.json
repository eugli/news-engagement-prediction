Just one organ donor can save up to eight lives.\nThe province wants to increase that percentage in a bid to shorten often lengthy wait times for the hundreds of patients waiting for new organs at any given time. Last year saw the highest number of transplants in the history of B.C.\nThis is the first initiative of its kind in Canada, and will become a permanent fixture in B.C. after the success of a pilot project at four driver licensing locations across the province saw more than 15,000 customers register as organ donors.\nNorth Vancouver resident Shannon Westerlund has experienced the importance of organ donations firsthand: her teenage son Andrew was a given a second chance at life through an emergency heart transplant.\n“[My son] is alive, and he’s thriving today because of that donor and their family,” she said.\n“The need is huge, and I don’t think people realize how great the need really is… [register] now, because you don’t know what the future will bring to you.”\nWant to check if you're registered to donate or want to register?
