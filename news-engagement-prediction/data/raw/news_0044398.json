There are things she won't do. \nThese include: \"Incest role plays, water sports/mud sports, most fetish type stuff, two dudes at once (for safety reasons. If I'm alone with one dude I stand a chance of beating him in a fight should things get ugly. Two dudes, I have no chance) and long bookings out of the city.\" There are some men she refused to sleep with (Photo: Getty) \nShe also revealed she refused to engage with Irish men as a rule, though did not go into much more detail than that. So what are the men she does agree to see like? \nMostly white collar workers between the ages of 40 to 60, the woman revealed her clients were, by and large, \"Caucasian, Indian and Asian than other races. I'm happy with this, because these guys are well mannered and really generous.\" \nOf the married men among these, she said habitually between 7am and 8am were the best times to meet. \nSince becoming a sex worker, she also admitted she had bedded between 1100 and 1200 men.

My GP has dated escorts before and he is adamant that I keep it secret from any future boyfriend I may meet after I retire because it will always be niggling at the back of his head. \n\"That's just his opinion though. I take it with a grain of salt.\" Read More The escort criticised the portrayal of sex workers in the media \nAnd as for what she believes are misconceptions about being a sex worker, she says: \n\"I hate the black and white representations of it. In media sex workers are either dirty junkies on the street or posh courtesans seeing CEOs in expensive hotels. \n\"There's a hell of a lot of in between. \n\"My circumstances have changed numerous times throughout my sex work career but I haven't ever felt like I could identify with how it's portrayed in media.\" Read More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:38:33.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
