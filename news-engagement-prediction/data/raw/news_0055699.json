But if he lets the city take care of it, it only creates a target. \n“A tagger now has a new blank slate,” said Payton. “Here’s a new spot to paint over.” \nPayton and other like Payne want stricter enforcement, arrests and their damages paid for by those responsible. \n“If they want to come down here and do this, we’re just going to make it our own,” said Payne. “We’re not scared of anybody coming down here.” \nThe Dallas Police Department said it is now looking into the issue and urges residents to report the crimes to give officers a better idea of the problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:21:00.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
