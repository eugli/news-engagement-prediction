The G6 is successor to the G5 and unlike that phone doesn't feature the modular design. Instead, it has a more regular design, although there are some key features that may help standout LG G6 in a crowded market. Also Read: LG G6 launched with 18:9 Full Vision display, wide-angle 13MP dual rear cameras Specifications \nProcessor: The LG G6, although a flagship phone, uses Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, which is from last year. This year most other top smartphones will possibly use Snapdragon 835, although how much of a difference will that make remains to be seen. \nRAM: 4GB RAM \nInternal storage: 32GB variant + 64GB variant \nScreen: The LG G6 has a 5.7-inch screen with an aspect ratio of 18:9. The effective resolution is 2880 X 1440 pixels. \nRear camera: The G6 has two cameras on the rear. One is a regular camera with 13-megapixel image sensor and a very bright F1.8 lens. The other is a wide-angle camera. It also has a 13-megapixel image sensor but with a lens with a wider 125 degrees field of view. Also, this lens has F2.4 aperture. \nFront camera: 5-megapixel camera. F2.2 lens. 100-degree FoV. \nWeight: 163 grams \nSize: 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9mm \nSoftware: Android Nougat customised with LG's own user interface called UX 6.0. \nBattery: 3,300 mAh with turbo charging support. Special features \nThe LG G6 has several unique features. How much of a difference they will make is remains to be seen. But for now the list of unique features. \n-- The 18:9 screen is one of the most highlighted aspects of the phone. Reason? It's big enough and yet, because of the aspect ratio keeps the phone slim enough (72mm) to make it usable with one hand. Also LG claims that this aspect ratio is better when it comes to watching movies or playing games. \n-- The LG G6 has a fairly sleek design, with a metal frame and glass back cover. \n-- The LG G6 has a fingerprint scanner on the rear cover, under the cameras. \n-- The LG G6 is IP68 certified. This means it is waterproof, dust-proof and rain-proof. \n-- The LG G6 comes with Google Assistant, which makes it the first non-Google phone to get the Assistant. \n-- The LG G6, as specified in the camera section, has a wide-angle camera that will help users click better landscape photos. \n-- The LG G6 is the first smartphone to come with Dolby Vision. Also it supports HDR 10. End result? More vivid videos and images on the screen. \n-- LG G6 also comes with 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC, which means better sound quality when used with compatible headphones.
