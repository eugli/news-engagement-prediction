(Picture: Getty) \nArsenal fans were left scratching their heads as Danny Welbeck was named in the Under-23 side just one day before the side’s FA Cup tie with Sutton. Theo Walcott left red-faced as Arsenal fans slam club for 'disrespectful' gesture \nA large section of Gooners were desperate for Arsene Wenger to start Welbeck in their Champions League clash with Bayern Munich in midweek but the forward was an unused substitute in the 5-1 defeat. \nThe England star is still working his way back to full fitness after returning from a serious knee injury in January but many were desperate to see him handed game-time at the Allianz Arena. \nHowever, on Sunday, Welbeck was named in the U23 team to face Leicester City, alongside the likes of Donyell Malen, Chris Willock and Cohen Bramall. #AFCU23 team to face @LCFC : Keto, Johnson, Olowu, Sheaf, Bramall, Nelson, Dasilva, Malen, Dragomir, C Willock, Welbeck pic.twitter.com/9Rb8r2eGkB \n— Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) February 19, 2017 \nWelbeck’s surprising selection would appear to suggest that he will not play a part in the Gunners’ cup match at Gander Green Lane on Monday evening.
