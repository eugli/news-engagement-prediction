Today, EW has a first look at Samurai Jack season 5, set to debut on Adult Swim Saturday, March 11 at 11:00pm ET/PT.

But a foolish samurai warrior wielding a magic sword stepped forth to oppose me. Before the final blow was struck, I tore open a portal in time, and flung him into the future where my evil is law. Now the fool seeks to return to the past and undo the future that is Aku.” \nBut Jack never made it back to the past. \nWhen Samurai Jack season 5 begins, it’s been 50 years since we saw the hero and time has not been kind to him. Aku has destroyed every time portal and Jack ( Phil Lamarr ) has stopped aging, a side effect of time travel. It seems he is cursed to just roam the land for all eternity. His past haunts him as well as a cult of assassins dedicated to killing him for Aku’s glory. \nSamurai Jack season 5 is created, executive produced and directed by Genndy Tartakovsky and produced by Cartoon Network Studios . \nAre you excited for Samurai Jack season 5 to finally conclude the series?
