In fact they're mostly rat eating, wide-eyed horrorshows. \nAnd yet the story of Oscar, the \"mystical\" and \"very clumsy\" owl, is one that we can all recognise, one way or the other. \nLike many of us after a couple of drinks out on the town, Oscar has gotten himself a little bit lost. Following his performance at a bird show in Australia's Adelaide Zoo, Oscar, who is new to the area, got a fright and disappeared up a tree. \nThe zoo's Facebook call to action has since gone into overdrive, with people sending their thoughts and prayers and discussing rumoured Oscar sightings around town. SEE ALSO: Twitter is freaking out about the existence of hairless animals \nYou see, rather than head back to the zoo and his waiting handlers post-show, Oscar scampered off into the night, like the elusive weirdo he clearly is. \nOscar, who has been described by his handler in an interview with the ABC as looking \"rather mystical, like he's just flown out of a Harry Potter movie, or maybe Dark Crystal, \" makes a nice change from the usual horrifying owls that seem to dominate the internet. \nHe seems more chill than these unforgiving nightmares, for instance. \nGonna barf. \nOr these pale, dead-eyed aliens. \nThe eyes... The eyes... \nOr this goddamn Dracula-looking shapeshifter. \nSweet Jesus. \nLuckily then, his story looks like it's on the verge of having a happy ending. \nDespite spending the night bumping around the place like a lout, Oscar as been spotted hanging out at the local university, possibly because universities often resemble Hogwarts. \nImage: Adelaide Zoo/Facebook \nThe sighting is thanks in no small part to a dedicated team of \"Oscar-trackers\" that have been out looking for him. \nAnd also this Facebooker user that managed to spot him out and about. \nCome home, Oscar. You are loved! Just don't bring any of your creepy-ass owl friends back with you. \nGet away from me!
