Had to take up a job at the age of 16.\" She is also an art enthusiast, travel lover.\nStriking a balance between professional and personal life is difficult, especially when both require a hundred per cent attention. \"Yes it is difficult. It took some deep soul-searching for me to understand the importance of both and the balance I needed to create.\"\nA firm believer of 'with great power comes great responsibility', Gilbile has her plate full with hindrances of professional life and accountability towards private life. \"It is all about balancing your routine. I prioritize my responsibilities as and when I am required to and I devote my time towards my child, my corporate job and my fitness,\" says Gilbile.\nThe issue that most of us face when dealing with two lives at the same time (personal and professional) is how to distinguish between both and yet create balance. Gilbile talks about how women like her need to invest in some 'me-time' in order to achieve that equilibrium, \"Atleast thrice in a week, take out time to indulge in the activities that you love. I do the same by gymming, writing and listening to music.\"\nAfter fulfilling all these roles, Gilbile has another journey she is about to embark on. The flight to Mrs. India 2017. By gratifying to this feather in her kitty, she wishes to create a platform where people share their experiences and encourage others through their stories of perseverance, courage and passion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T12:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:55:06.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
