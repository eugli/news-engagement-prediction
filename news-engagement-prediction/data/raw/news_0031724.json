Thrillist/Facebook Thrillist employees are unionizing. \nNext, Thrillist employees, backed by the Writers Guild, plan to ask parent company Group Nine Media to voluntarily recognize the union and begin bargaining over a contract. If Group Nine Media chooses not to do so, the union can go on strike for recognition or obtain a secret-ballot election. \nThe publicly traded media conglomerate Discovery Communications became the largest owner of Thrillist in October when it purchased major stakes in the site and two other venture-funded media companies for $100 million . It created a new company, Group Nine Media, to hold the new sites with several of its other digital properties. \nLast week, Group Nine laid off over 25 Thrillist staff members, according to Schneck. \n“Management has given us all reassurances that this was a one-time move and everything else going forward is all about hiring and expanding the company,” he said. “With that said, we all realize that without any kind of written, contractual obligations ... there are no guarantees.” \nThrillist’s unionization is part of a wave of organizing that has swept the digital media industry in the past two years as a maturing cohort of contemporary journalists have sought on-the-job representation. \nEarlier this month, MTV News staff announced its intention to unionize with the Writers Guild. On Tuesday, management voluntarily recognized their union. \nThe Huffington Post is the largest digital media outlet to unionize, ratifying its first collectively bargained contract at the end of January.
