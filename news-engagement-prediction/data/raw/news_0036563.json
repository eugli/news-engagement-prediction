We also, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, do not have enough gas suppliers,\" he said. What's causing the shortage? \nThe ACCC pointed to three factors driving the domestic gas shortage. \nFirst, the majority of Australia's liquefied natural gas (LNG) is exported to Asia. \n\"Three LNG plants went ahead at the same time — $20-billion investments — that saw a lot of gas being exported,\" Mr Sims said. \nReserve Bank research shows that more than 80 per cent of Australia's LNG is exported to Japan, while China and Korea take most of what is left. \nThe LNG purchased by Asian buyers is largely committed under long-term contracts, meaning the price is locked in.

Is fracking the solution? \nFracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a way of extracting unconventional gases from coal seams and shale. High-pressure water and chemicals are pumped into rock which is fractured to release the trapped gases. \nOpponents argue that it damages water tables and the environment. \nNew South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have temporary or permanent bans in place. \nMr Sims said more gas exploration, of some description, was critical. \n\"We just need to explore and develop more gas. That, I am afraid, is the only answer we have left,\" he said. \nHe suggested one solution may be building more gas plants and pipelines, including the Northern Gas Pipeline.
