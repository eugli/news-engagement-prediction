James Martin/CNET @caspertek Taylor Martin/CNET \nOut of the box, Alexa can do an impressive number of things . It can stream Amazon Music or Spotify , control your Philips Hue smart bulbs or anything connected to a SmartThings hub and integrate with IFTTT for a laundry list of other functions. You can also order millions of products off Amazon without lifting a finger . \nBut what has really propelled Amazon's Alexa forward as a bonafide platform, not just intelligent software behind a few connected speakers, is the Smart Home Skill API . This allows third-party developers to create apps and tap into the power of Alexa without ever needing native support. Major brands have already jumped on the bandwagon and more are soon to follow, especially if the popularity of products like the Amazon Echo continues to grow. \nIf you're looking to make your Alexa speaker even more helpful around the house, we've got your back. Below you will find some of Alexa's most helpful, clever and entertaining skills available today. A skill for finding skills Alexa skills themselves are quite helpful, and there are nearly 1,900. However, even with an updated Skills section in the Alexa app and the ability to add skills using only your voice, discovering new and useful skills is a less than desirable experience. So much so that Amazon actually created a skill called Skill Finder to discover new skills. Launch it by saying, \"Alexa, open Skill Finder\" or \"Alexa, tell Skill Finder to give me the skill of the day.\" Here's everything the Amazon Echo can do Finance The Capital One skill allows you to check your credit card balance or make a payment when one is due. This is secure: The skill performs security checks and requires you sign in using your username and password. Then, when you open the skill, you must provide a four-digit code to confirm your identity. Just be wary of who is around when using the skill -- anyone who overhears you say your personal key can access your banking or credit card info just by asking Alexa. If you'd like to check stock prices before heading out in the morning, try Opening Bell . This Skill allows you to ask for a stock price using a company's natural name instead of the ticker symbol, such as, \"Alexa, ask Opening Bell for the price of Google.\" Productivity You can use IFTTT to push additions to your Amazon To-do List to Google Calendar, or you can use the Quick Events skill. Say something like \"Alexa, tell Quick Events to add go to the grocery store tomorrow at 6:00\" to add an event to your calendar. If you're in marketing or are just looking for some ideas that are outside the box, enable the Giant Spoon skill. Chances are, the ideas aren't always going to be applicable to what you're working on, but in my use, they've sparked some interesting ideas. Smart home and car Out of the box, Alexa has support for IFTTT, but not Yonomi. Support for Yonomi is enabled through a skill. Yonomi is a lot like IFTTT, but designed specifically for the smart home. Yonomi creates virtual devices for each scene you create, so the command sounds more natural, such as, \"Alexa, turn on Sunset.\" You can also keep tabs on your car with Alexa using the Automa tic skill. Automatic is a dongle you install in your car's OBDII port which connects with your smartphone and tracks the status of your car. You can connect your Automatic account to Alexa and ask for the current fuel level, where your car is or how far you've driven in a span of time.
