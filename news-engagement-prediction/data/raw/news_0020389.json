The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. \n(CNN) On Monday night, supermodel Christie Brinkley took to Instagram to announce her return to Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue, the cover of which she graced for three consecutive years starting in 1979, when she was in her 20s. \nThis time, Brinkley, now 63, appears with Alexa Ray Joel, her 31-year-old daughter with ex-husband Billy Joel, and Sailor Brinkley Cook, her 18-year-old daughter with ex-husband Peter Cook. \"Thank you Sports Illustrated,\" she wrote, \"for sending the powerful message that good things come in packages of every size and we do not come with an expiration date!\" No question, the photo spread sends a powerful message -- but it's not really the positive, affirming one of which Brinkley is thinking. In fact, at this particular moment in history, as millions of women march for rights that are being threatened, or which don't exist -- including reproductive rights and the right to equal pay -- her SI babes-in-swimsuits project rings extremely tone deaf. Photos: Sexy in their 60s Christie Brinkley turned 60 in February 2014 by showing off her birthday (swim)suit on the cover of People magazine . Now 61, the model and mom of three posted photos of herself in November 2015. Here are a few other celebs who are sexy in their 60s. Hide Caption 1 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s Ever since Rick Springfield pined for \"Jessie's Girl\" in 1981, the song became an enduring pop hit, just like Springfield himself, who turned 66 on August 23. But he's no one-hit wonder, Springfield -- seen here performing in July -- also has a successful acting career, including credits like \"General Hospital,\" \"Californication\" and \"Hawaii Five-O.\" Hide Caption 2 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s Shelley Long, 66, may forever be known as Diane Chambers from \"Cheers,\" but she's shown no signs of a career slowdown since the show ended in 1993. From \"Troop Beverly Hills\" to \"The Brady Bunch\" to \"Modern Family,\" Long makes all her roles memorable. Here, she's seen in an episode of ABC Family's \"Switched at Birth\" from 2014. Hide Caption 3 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s If anything, Meryl Streep has only gotten sexier with age. The Oscar winner, who turned 66 on June 22, has shattered the notion that actresses should leave Hollywood when they hit 30. In the eyes of The Telegraph's film critic, David Gritten , it all comes \"down to sex. ... Apart from her remarkable skills as a film actress, there's a glow, a sensuality and a radiance about Streep these days. Put simply, she's looking great.\" Hide Caption 4 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s Kathleen Turner still has plenty of \"Body Heat\" at 61. Hide Caption 5 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s Some of Pam Grier's \"Foxiest\" work is older than some of her fans, but the film star's still got it. The cancer survivor turned 66 on May 26. Hide Caption 6 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s Oprah Winfrey turned 61 on January 29 and last year said she is feeling healthy and strong. \"I no longer have to be concerned about what anyone thinks of me!\" the media star said on her 60th birthday . \"I'm turning 60, and I've earned the right to be just as I am. I'm more secure in being myself than I've ever been.\" Hide Caption 7 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s Miley Cyrus said on her October 7 appearance on \"Today\" that she's heard people over 40 \"don't have sex anymore.\" Leave it to Suzanne Somers, now 68, to correct the 20-year-old singer. The former \"Three's Company\" star told the ladies of \"The Talk \" last year that she and her husband, Alan Hamel, 78, actually have sex \"a couple times a day.\" Listen to your elders, Miley. Hide Caption 8 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s Actor Kurt Russell, 64, and partner Goldie Hawn, 70, are championed as one of the happiest unmarried couples around. Whenever we see them, they're always beaming. Onlookers at a New York movie premiere in September 2014 commented that the two could hardly keep their hands off one another. Hide Caption 9 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s How many 63-year-olds know what it's like to have the Internet practically squeal with glee at the sight of them in boxer-briefs ? Liam Neeson does. Hide Caption 10 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s At 69, Cher has no need to turn back time. On the cover of her latest album, \"Closer to the Truth,\" the singer proved how young she feels in skimpy lingerie, and she's been known to tweet photos of herself in fishnets and knee-high boots . When one fan responded to one such picture asking whether Cher has \"discovered how to get hot boys yet,\" Cher responded, \"I'm way too old for hot boys. Hot men, now that's another story.\" Hide Caption 11 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s When then-64-year-old Richard Gere opened a boutique hotel in 2012, he told CNN he had a very clear understanding of what he wanted the design to convey. \"Sex -- every choice in here was about sex,\" People's former Sexiest Man Alive said. And yet, the guy doesn't believe that he has \"a certain impact\" on the opposite sex. He is now 66. Hide Caption 12 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s Musician Sting, 64, has never been shy about sharing details of his sex life. He and wife Trudie Styler aren't quite having tantric sex for hours, as rumor has claimed , but they do like to keep things spicy. \"I don't think pedestrian sex is very interesting,\" he told Harper's Bazaar in 2011 . \"There's a playfulness we have; I like the theater of sex. I like to look good. I like her to dress up. I like to dress her up. ... Romantic? We like tawdry.\" Hide Caption 13 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s Jessica Lange nearly set the big screen on fire with her steamy work alongside Jack Nicholson in 1981's \"The Postman Always Rings Twice.\" At 66, she's still gorgeous. In 2013, her bedroom was a source of speculation as her rep had to debunk a rumor that she was \"making sweet music\" with her \"American Horror Story\" co-star, Sarah Paulson. Hide Caption 14 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s Now 62, Pierce Brosnan can still play the older gentleman who falls for a younger lover, as he did in 2012 at the age of 60 with \"Love Is All You Need.\" It has been years since the former 007 was named People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive, but Brosnan is secure in his standing. \"There's nothing to prove,\" he told \"Today\" in April 2012. \"I feel comfortable in my own skin.\" Hide Caption 15 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s Bruce Springsteen, 66, is sexy -- and he knows it, as he proved in his cover of LMFAO's song on \"Late Night\" in 2012. And have you seen his abs? Hide Caption 16 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s The secret to Jeff Bridges' sex appeal? Keeping it real. As he said in 2010 , \"Being a sex symbol is all about honesty. That's not how I see myself at all, but I think the attractive men are the ones who show you who they are.\" Bridges turns 66 on December 4. Hide Caption 17 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s \"Today\" personality Kathie Lee Gifford is an open book at 62. She'll happily talk freely about pubic hair care -- or how sex after 40 is all about quality, not quantity. (Tell that to Suzanne Somers.) Hide Caption 18 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s Like many of her 60-something counterparts, Jane Seymour has no problem getting cast in a sensual role. The 64-year-old actress appeared on \"Franklin & Bash\" as a \"sex surrogate.\" Hide Caption 19 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s Is it any wonder Bill Cosby's \"Cosby Show\" character, Cliff Huxtable, was always trying to get quality time with his wife, Clair? With Phylicia Rashad, who's still just as classy at 67, in the role, it was totally believable. Hide Caption 20 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s Susan Lucci â€“ Susan Lucci embodied sex appeal for decades as Erica Kane on \"All My Children.\" Now 68, the actress has taken her spark from daytime to prime time -- she's starring on \"Devious Maids,\" which she's described as a combination of \"intrigue and murder, mayhem, little surprises and sexy. ... All the good stuff.\" Hide Caption 21 of 22 Photos: Sexy in their 60s Susan Sarandon â€“ Susan Sarandon was once told her sexy days would soon come to an end before she even turned 40, and the actress recalled last year that she (rightly) laughed at the notion. Now 69, Sarandon has said sensuality is \"really more of an attitude than it is being naked,\" she told People magazine. \"I'm happy to be considered desirable. I love it!\" Hide Caption 22 of 22 You could argue -- as people try to do every year -- that the iconic issue is empowering, a celebration of women, edited by a woman . Many of the models are paid very generously for their work (modeling, in fact, is one of the few industries in which women out-earn men ). And over the years, the magazine has done a decent job featuring models of a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, including athletes like American mixed martial artist Ronda Rousey and Australian hurdler Michelle Jenneke. Last year's big news was the inclusion of the issue's first \"plus-size\" cover girl, Ashley Graham . And, yes, this year, as Brinkley notes, the magazine includes as a swimsuit model a sexagenarian, a concept that apparently shocked even her. \"My first thought was, 'At my age? No way!'\" Brinkley tells People magazine . \"When I turned 30, I was like, 'This is the last time I'm posing in a bathing suit!' When this issue comes out, I'll be 63. I thought, 'Those days are over.'\" Read More And yet, here she is. Proof that beauty has no time stamp? Or just another impossible ideal that women are asked to strive for -- youthful beauty, almost literally until the day we die? I think we know the real answer to this. Are powerful women Trump's Achilles heel? (opinion) Because we do, it's hard not to cringe when Brinkley touts the swimsuit appearance as affirmation not only for herself, but for her daughters. \"How many years ago I was that insecure girl hoping that I would be good enough for the magazine,\" she told ET. \"So to see my daughters now having the same thoughts I had, and to be able to see them actually be there on the job, was definitely a big moment.\" As if being deemed \"good enough\" to appear in a bathing suit is, in fact, the standard girls should live up to, the things that rescues them from their insecurity. As if there aren't tons of other things we could and should be wishing for our daughters right now -- not needing affirmation from anyone else, for one thing. Brinkley is indeed beautiful. So are her daughters. But their inclusion in this issue is proof of nothing other than that the world continues to need to see female role models of various talents, types, hair colors, and waist sizes in various areas of achievement. And that the end has come for raising girls to view getting a magazine spread as the validation they need to carry on. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook \nTo wit: On the same day Brinkley instagrammed about her SI spread, organizers of last month's Women's March heralded an upcoming strike . \"A day without women ... at a time when our foundational principles of freedom and equality are under threat.\" One more thing: Featuring a 63-year-old in a swimsuit magazine when that 63-year-old looks like Brinkley isn't \"diversity\" or some sort of celebration of alt-womanhood -- a sign that growing old is no longer a threat. Aging is still very much a threat to most women, and not just for the wrinkles and bags and bikini modeling end-of-days. It's just one of the many things we have to worry about right now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:40:12.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
