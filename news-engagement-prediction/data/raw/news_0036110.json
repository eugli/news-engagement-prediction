Pretty ignorant. \nAfrica is actually clear of Ebola as of 2016 per the World Health Organization , and anyway this is such a very sheltered way of thinking — and not the type of sentiment to joke about. \nFrankly, it's this type of thinking about other parts of the world that allows people to get elected on platforms of building walls… \nIt is kiiiinda making fun of himself, so at least it's clear he KNOWS how bad the initial thought was. But maybe instead of laughing off that thought, James, you should just quietly try to be more woke next time. \nIn any case, Twitter was not having the teen's self commentary. \nWhile there were those who defended James, others decried his ignorance, some even saying they would boycott CoverGirl until he was removed as ambassador: \nI will no longer support your company as long as he's on the campaign. This was stereotypical & degrading to Africa. @COVERGIRL @COVERGIRL pic.twitter.com/RpgMp1lqfg \n— IG/SC: ParisHeelton (@ImTheBombDotCom) February 16, 2017 \ngo. He should learn that actions have consequences. Hope @COVERGIRL does the right thing or I guess I'll be taking my money elsewhere. \n— Adomah Akyereko (@AltiusTendo) February 16, 2017 \n@COVERGIRL its not his first racist remark Y'all got a racist representing your company until y'all remove him this will happen #COVERGIRL pic.twitter.com/vVDTsFkHCQ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:07:11.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
