The Justice Department also warned that the judge’s decision posed immediate harm to the public, and second-guessed the president’s national security judgment.'

For the safety of the country, we’ll win,” he told reporters in Florida, as cited by Reuters. \nFriday’s ruling by Seattle US District Judge James Robart place a temporary stop nationwide on the enforcement of Trump’s executive order barring nationals from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for three months, and indefinitely banning all Syrian refugees. \nREAD MORE: #NoBanNoWall: Anti-Trump protests continue throughout Europe & US \nThe executive order prompted large protests across the country, as well as a number of lawsuits. In his temporary restraining order on the ban, Judge Robart questioned the administration’s use of 9/11 to justify the order, saying that no attacks have been carried out on US soil by individuals from any of the seven countries listed. \nThe Justice Department appeal stated that Robart’s legal reasoning was lacking, noting also that the state of Washington does not have the legal standing to challenge a presidential directive. \nThe Department of Homeland Security stopped flagging travelers from the countries blacklisted by the Trump administration following the judge’s ruling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T14:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T09:47:48.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
