(AP) More The Washington Wizards are acquiring forward Bojan Bogdanovic in a trade with the Brooklyn Nets, league sources told The Vertical.\nThe Wizards will send a 2017 lottery-protected first-round draft pick, forward Andrew Nicholson and guard Marcus Thornton to the Nets, league sources said.\nForward Chris McCullough will join Bogdanovic in the deal to Washington, sources said.\nThe trade gives the Nets two first-round picks in the deep 2017 NBA draft. Brooklyn is due to swap its own pick with the Boston Celtics , which means the Nets will likely have two picks in the 20s range of the draft. Brooklyn general manager Sean Marks inherited a franchise devoid of picks, but used a trade-deadline deal a year ago to send Thadeus Young to Indiana that brought the Nets the 20th overall pick. The Nets drafted Michigan’s Caris LeVert , who has shown significant promise in his rookie season.\nFor the Wizards, Bogdanovic, who averages 14.2 points per game, brings an accomplished scorer off the bench for the rest of the regular season and playoffs. Bogdanovic, 27, is a restricted free agent this summer.\nThe Nets assumed the contract of Nicholson, who signed a four-year, $26 million free-agent deal with Washington in July. Nicholson, 27, has played in 28 games with Washington, averaging 8.3 minutes a game. He was Orlando’s first-round pick in the 2012 NBA draft out of St. Bonaventure University. The Nets also plan to waive Thornton.\nMcCullough was the 29th overall pick out of Syracuse in 2015.\nThe Wizards cleared two contracts – Nicholson’s and Thornton’s – that’ll help ease the burden of re-signing Otto Porter this summer. Porter will be a restricted free agent. Washington’s guaranteed contracts for 2017-18 drop from $95.9 million to $91.1 million with the deal. The Wizards will be pressed against the luxury tax, and the savings will help offset the cost.\nMore on Yahoo Sports:\n• Ex-WNBA star Wiggins claims she was bullied for being straight\n• Lakers president Buss says she waited too long to fire her brother Jim\n• The NBA trade deadline’s most intriguing teams\n• Transgender teen wins wrestling title in controversial fashion", "external_links": ["https://yhoo.it/2mcrrqM&quot;", "https://yhoo.it/2l8rYZM&quot;", "https://yhoo.it/2lGaDKZ&quot;", "https://yhoo.it/2kMsyjD", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pnr-wp/2017/02/22160756/AP_17008710392746.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1zj_r.vWwZtWufGUxrbCmg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTI1/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/28bddd6bd63cd485a71e4cb37d753029", "https://yhoo.it/2kMsyjD&quot;", "https://yhoo.it/2l8rYZM", "https://yhoo.it/2lGaDKZ", "https://yhoo.it/2mcrrqM"], "published": "2017-02-23T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:59:34.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
