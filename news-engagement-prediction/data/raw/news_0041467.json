So they are thrown from pillar to post.” \nPaula and Jackie launched Tom Harrison House in 2013 when they saw veterans were being failed, naming it in memory of Paula’s grandfather. \nIt had been open for only a year when Paul arrived and he was quickly immersed in the programme, which draws on research from the United States suggesting that equine therapy – working with horses – can help those with addictions. \nIt wasn’t long before Paul was taken for his first session at Shy Lowen, a rescue horse centre based near Kirby, where the Tom Harrison House veterans spend two hours each week. MATTHEW POVER Veteran Paul Connor who suffers from PTSD with Rolo the horse \nThere, he met Charmer, an eight-year-old horse who struggled with issues very like Paul’s. \nCharmer had been sold to a family as a pony, but had grown to be too difficult for their children to handle and too dangerous to ride. \n“Charmer was just like me,” says Paul. \n“He was hyperactive, he couldn’t sit down, so I felt a connection straight away. He was like a mirror image of myself. I have issues with trust and so did he, so I felt like I understood him and he understood me. As I was working with him I could see he was just getting better and better.” \nThe veterans start by grooming their horse to form a relationship, building their confidence with the animal and getting to know them. \nThey then move on to other tasks including walking them around cones and along set paths, all of which are designed to encourage trust between animal and human. \nFor 12 weeks Paul and Charmer built a relationship, until eventually Charmer would follow Tom around the obstacle courses without any lead. \nThrough Paul’s work, Charmer became tame and was rehomed successfully with a loving family. World War II: Unseen pictures Tue, January 27, 2015 These US Army images appeared to be lost in time but photographer Levi Bettweiser bought 31 rusty reels from an auction in Ohio, USA. The shots, which have been identified as locations across the UK, including Boston Harbour, Lucky Strike Beach and LaHavre Harbour thanks to labels on the reels, shed new light on wartime life for US soldiers. Mercury Press & Media Ltd/The Rescued Film Project 1 of 33 More than 30 Second World War pictures have finally been developed - 70 years after the end of the conflict. \nPaul BELIEVES that Charmer did him the world of good too. \n“There were a few times where I would stand across a field and just whistle and he would come to me,” he recalls. \n“The other lads were amazed by it. “I loved him to bits. He has come a long way, like myself, and has moved on now. That makes me so happy. We helped each other. I have been clean for three years now.” \nBernadette Langfield, chairwoman of trustees at Shy Lowen, agrees that the project is mutually beneficial. \nThey had already been running an equine-assisted learning project with disaffected youths, but Bernadette says that everyone involved has been thrilled with the results of the work with Tom Harrison’s House. \n“The programme is so successful because both parties get so much out of it,” she says. \n“The veterans get a feeling of giving something back, which can do wonders for a person’s self-esteem, and horses are incredible at reading humans. \n“Their intuition means that they can read the emotional state of a person, so the veterans really have to let their guard down and learn to trust the horses.
