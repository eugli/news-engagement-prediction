The Rohini one will be a dedicated heliport and will make chopper movement much easier,\" he added. \n\nOnly top VVIPs and industrialists manage to get permission for flying in or out of IGI in choppers. The country's top dignitaries, including the president, prime minister, home minister and chief ministers of a few states, use choppers from Safdarjung airport. \n\n\"To promote regional air connectivity, Pawan Hans has also prepared a roadmap to connect all the major destinations from this heliport such as Delhi to Shimla, Haridwar, Dehradun, Mathura, Agra, Meerut and industrial hubs such as Manesar, Bahadurgarh etc,\" PHHL had said in February last year. \n\nPawan Hans had successfully carried out the first trial test landing an Eccuriall B3 chopper exactly a year ago to assess standard operating procedures and safety standards. Since then it has carried out many more tests. This heliport has a terminal building having capacity of 150 passengers, four hangers with parking capacities of 16 helicopters and 9 parking bays.
