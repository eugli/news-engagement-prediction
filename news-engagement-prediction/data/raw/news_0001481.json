Picture courtesy:Twitter/bluefrogpune_ \nA young man was playing khartal when a group of foreigners spotted him at the Artist colony of Jaisalmer. The next thing you know, he was performing before the audience in Corsica, France. \nThis is how Kutle Khan's musical journey took off in the year 2000, after which, there was no looking back. During a recent chat with India Today Digital, the talented musician reflected upon his 16-year-long career, musical pursuits and upcoming projects for the year. \nOn inheriting music and reviving it with time \nKutle Khan hails from Rajasthan's Manganiyar district, where music has been his family tradition for years. With music being a part of his bloodstream, Khan says his father, Jethu Khan, introduced him to the world of creating tunes at the age of eight. Today, this musician has moved beyond his boundaries and has evolved as a global medium of reviving the authentic folk music of Rajasthan. \nKutle's music genres that include folk and Sufi, require some basic insights, which Khan ensures while performing. \n\" Hum audience ko har ek instrument ke baare mein batate bhi hai \"(We also explain about each of these instruments to the audience), affirmed this multi-instrumentalist. \nAnd what makes these renditions unique? It is local music blended with contemporary styles, without compromising on its indigenous Rajasthani flavour. Each of Khan's compositions are adorned with instruments like the khartal or sarangi whose music is comfortably woven into a more regular saxophone or a flute. \nAlso Read: Shalmali Kholgade's entry into Bollywood was a master stroke of serendipity \nOn the Kutle Khan Project \nThe renowned Kutle Khan Project has been framed along these very lines. If music is all-encompassing, Kutle proves it by promoting the small town, budding musicians of Rajasthan through this musical platform. '' Rajasthan ke chhote sheheron se naye artists dhundte hai aur woh isme gaate hai \" (We pick up new artists from the small towns of Rajasthan who perform with me). The team, that has only grown in the past 6-7 years, now has over 40 artists who perform Sufi, folk, fusion and even Kutle's self-compositions. \nAlso Read: When Tanmay Bhat cried, and Amit Trivedi could not help laughing \nOn Coke Studio, performing abroad and his love for Indian audience \nIn the recent years, the artist has shared stage with leading musicians like Amit Trivedi, Kailash Kher, Susheela Raman and Midival Punditz among others. He debuted at MTV Coke Studio with Trivedi's unforgettable composition Khari Khari in 2013. Besides contributing to platforms like Coke Studio and The Dewarists, Kutle has wooed the audience with his powerful music in more than 70 countries till now.

Among his upcoming endeavours is a folk album that has already been recorded and is scheduled for release soon. He is also setting up the Kutle Khan Project Studio in Jaislamer to educate kids about our musical and cultural heritage. \nAll set to perform at upcoming Riders Music Festival, Delhi, the artist said that he will be playing the khartal and morchang to accompany his self compositions.
