To be honest, the country could do with an unpopular leader but who is effective in bringing change. PM Najib Abdul Razak is probably aware of this, and he is likely to consider this as academic. \nOpinions from urban constituents are unlikely to bother him. He has already seemingly ‘fixed’ the rules and electoral system. His team is one, and there is only his voice. He may allow noisy opposition voices but he will make sure their teeth won’t bite. \nYes, he may be unpopular according to surveys, but he will be the one laughing all the way to Parliament, again. \nQuigonbond: A Selangor government poll will need to be seen with a pinch of salt because they may be partisan, so I wouldn't put too much beef on the results. \nAlso, 2,000 respondents in Petaling Jaya would think vastly different from 2,000 voters in Sungai Besar. We should apply the same kind of critical eye on any polls, whether it is BN poll or opposition poll. \nHowever, I think not just the opposition parties but all voters need to start thinking the unthinkable. \nAssuming for some reason the rural Malays decide that it's time to kick out BN, I'm concerned that there would have been terrible gerrymandering and there may be extensive fraud to win the election, or the worst case scenario, collusion between the police, the military and Umno to execute a national emergency to continue to stay in government. \nMalaysians need to develop a contingency against such an outcome. \nDont Just Talk: This survey comes in the wake of a prime minister who was caught with US$681 million in his personal account and the US Department of Justice (DOJ) alleging that US$3.5 billion was ‘stolen’ from the Malaysian people, quoting MO1 as a senior Malaysian leader, a close relative of Riza Aziz and associate of the alleged master-thief Jho Low. \nThe 'Tangkat Najib' rally carried out by the university students speaks volumes of his unpopularity amongst the literate young Malays. \nSadly, he remains adamant and refuse to resign and even if an election is called today, MO1 will still remain as PM, when 52 percent of popular votes at the 13th general election (GE) failed to dislodge him. \nLegit: Only 43 percent disagreed when asked \"legal action should not be taken against Malaysian Official 1 (MO1)\". \nInstitut Darul Ehsan (IDE) must have asked this question to many of those who do not understand the magnitude of 1MDB and the RM2.6 billion issues. \nLajib: I had a dream last night. What is the difference between RM40 billion and RM50 billion? It is just a number. You can't finish it in this life. \nWhat you leave behind after you pass on is a bunch of spoilt and rotten children and grandchildren who won't appreciate your hard work in wealth creation. But millions of people in Bolehland will suffer for few generations. \nDonplaypuks: We hardly need a poll to know that Najib is the least popular as well as allegedly ‘most corrupt’ PM and individual in Malaysian history. \nRelevant, too, would the fact that this government of alleged ‘thieves’, the cabinet and administration follow a close second. \nThe Analyser: It’s symptomatic of the standard of Malaysian politics that it should come down to popularity of individuals when it comes to choosing your government. \nBut when not one of the parties involved in the opposition have any philosophy, zero policies, no direction and no flicking idea of what to do next, then inevitably the decision comes down to race, religion and personalities. \nAnonymous_1371455474: Such an unprofessional statement from Institut Darul Ehsan deputy chairperson Mohammad Redzuan Othman. \nHow can he say Najib is the most unpopular just because his ratings go down. It has to be compared to other PM. If you use that basis, then former opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim is now the most unpopular because his ratings have gone down from 64% to 52% to 45% and now only 38%. \nI am not an admirer of Najib but I can see now why US President Donald Trump has a such a poor opinion of pollsters. \nPoll: Anwar, Hadi neck-and-neck among S'gor Malays, Kit Siang gets 1pct \nRealthistime: Malays are the most difficult people to survey. They tend to be polite, hence they might mention Anwar or PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang more as that's the popular thinking. Wait till GE14, only then we will know the truth. \nDon't forget Sarawakians, they could be kingmakers in GE14. Federal Land Development Authority (Felda) settlers? I am sure BN with lose some votes here. \nWhatever they choose would be better than alleged thieves, liars and hypocrites who have ruled for too long. \nEx-PJ: The polls show that while Chinese and Indians will vote for Malay politicians, the reverse is not true. There lies the biggest problem for Malaysia. \nA ‘corrupt’ Malay will get more votes than any Chinese or Indian politician. So the country will continue its slide into oblivion, continuously ‘looted’ by the Umno. \nSarawakian: A most depressing survey. If Hadi gets 32 percent of Malay support in Selangor, what's the figure in Kelantan and Terengganu? \nI can’t imagine what the Malays support him for - silence on 1MDB or being vocal on hudud? \nApa Nama?: I wonder who are the 4 percent Chinese who supported Hadi? Where's the logic in it when the Chinese were treated ‘badly’ by PAS. \nAnd in terms of capability, how could these 4 percent choose Hadi who allegedly does not want the best for all races? \nRoger 5201: This poll suggests Harapan without PAS will still get to keep Selangor. \nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers.
