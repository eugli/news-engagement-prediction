(Supplied) Bloemfontein SPCA to lay charges after cow beaten with knobkierrie \nCape Town – Police are investigating a complaint about a man who threw a rooster up in the air at a Stellenbosch University residence party at the weekend. \nPhotos also showed a lit cigarette being pushed into its beak during Helshoogte Residence's \"hoenderdag\" (chicken day) on Saturday. \nThe Animal Welfare Society of Stellenbosch (AWSS) said it laid a complaint with police in the town and the case has been assigned an investigator. \n\"Our inspector will be liaising with him and providing the necessary evidence to prosecute the accused,\" said AWSS spokesperson Jessica Perrins. \nThe organisation received a tip-off about the man's identity, but has not yet contacted him. \nWestern Cape police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed a case was opened. The rooster brought to the party is now safe and healthy. (Supplied) \nNo links to residence, university \nAnimal rights activists and members of the public reacted with outrage after a video and photos of the rooster emerged online. \nMost took to the residence's Facebook page to give it a 1-star rating, condemning the behaviour. \nThe residence came out against the animal abuse on the same day, saying the guilty party was not affiliated to it. \nThe university confirmed the man had no links to the residence and was not a student or alumnus. \nStellenbosch University spokesperson Martin Viljoen said the institution condemned animal cruelty and was investigating the incident. \n\"Hoenderdag is a celebration of music and dance with food stalls,\" said Viljoen. \nThe name originates from the residence emblem which features a chicken (hoender in Afrikaans) – considered a revered and respected symbol by residents. \n\"Chickens are however not involved in the day,\" he said. \nRooster 'ill-treated, terrified and tortured' \nThe event took place on the residence's premises and was open to anyone who paid a R30 entrance fee. \nPerrins said AWSS believes the individual brought the rooster to the event. \n\"This proves premeditation on the part of the alleged perpetrator. Why else would anyone bring a live chicken to the event?\" \nShe said the man had contravened various sections of the Animals Protection Act in that he allegedly \"ill-treated, terrified and tortured the rooster – he liberated the bird in such a manner as to expose it to immediate danger. It is very likely that he inhumanely carried and confined the rooster.\" \nShe condemned this behaviour on university premises. \nViljoen said all indications are that this was an isolated incident. The university has not received any other similar complaints. \nThe rooster is said to now be \"safe, happy and among other chickens\". \nWATCH: Join the conversation! \n24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24 .
