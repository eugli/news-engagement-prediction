Alex Oxlade Chamberlain likes an ArsenalFanTV video which suggests Arsène Wenger should be sacked. pic.twitter.com/nsjqH0hOkp - From The Stands (@FromTStands) February 4, 2017 even Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is on the #WengerOut bus :bus: this week ....check out his latest like #chears pic.twitter.com/TvYmzfjff2", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T19:19:33.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
