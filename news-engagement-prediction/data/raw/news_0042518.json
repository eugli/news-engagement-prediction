(PTI file photo) \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah are terrorists who are trying to terrorise people in Uttar Pradesh, a Samajwadi Party minister has said, as campaigning in the state turned ugly halfway through the seven-phase assembly elections. \nThe comment by Rajendra Chowdhary came shortly after Modi accused the SP government of discrimination on the basis of religion. \n“They want to create an environment of fear. They are both terrorists -- Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. They are creating terror in our democracy,” Chowdhary said. #Watch Narendra Modi aur Amit Shah dono aatankwaadi hain,aatank paida kar rahe hain loktantra mein says Samajwadi Party's Rajendra Chaudhary pic.twitter.com/KGdeunr2m0 — ANI UP (@ANINewsUP) February 20, 2017 \n“They have nothing to say and hence are making wild allegations. The BJP knows it is losing the plot in UP and it will fare worse than in Bihar,” the senior minister, who is also the party’s spokesperson, said after voting in the third round ended on Sunday. \nThe BJP was quick to respond. \n“It is their (SP’s) frustration and people of UP will punish them for such intemperate language against the PM,” said BJP vice president and party’s UP in-charge Om Mathur.

It isn’t just their tongue that is slipping. By the time seven round UP polls end UP would have slipped out of their control too,” Srivastava said. \nOn Sunday, Modi drew a parallel between Hindu and Muslim festivals to accuse the Akhilesh Yadav administration of practising discrimination on the basis of religion. \n“If you create kabristaan (graveyard) in a village, then a shamshaan (cremation ground) should be created. If electricity is given uninterrupted in Ramzan, then it should be given in Diwali without a break. Bhedbhaav nahin hona chahiye (there should be no discrimination,” Modi told a rally in Fatehpur, apparently playing the Hindutva card in the politically crucial state. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T06:14:38.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
