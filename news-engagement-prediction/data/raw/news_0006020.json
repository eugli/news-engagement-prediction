Jay Laga’aia strums his ukulele. Tziporah Malkah attempts to enlist Steve Price for \nsome sort of alt-right camp uprising \n. \nRiveting stuff, but it’s hard not to feel a little bit jealous when you learn what viewers of the German iteration of the show are treated to. \nThe German \nIch Bin Ein Star — Holt Mich Hier Raus! \nairs in January each year, and we can confirm there ain’t a crochet needle in sight. We have no idea who these people are — but then, we could say the same about the Aussie version. Source: Supplied \nInstead, ample screen time is spent lingering on the ample bosom of the various German B-listers as they clean up in the outdoor jungle shower. \nIt’s all a far cry from the Aussie I \n’m A Celeb \nshower, which in the past has shown us more of Merv Hughes than we ever needed to see and this year has seen camera-shy comedian Nazeem Hussain wrestling with a ‘shower smock’ he’d packed to preserve his modesty. \nIn \nIch Bin Ein Star — Holt Mich Hier Raus!, \nnobody seems to wear much clothing at all: très European. So it’s basically softcore porn. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied ‘Ich Bin Ein Star — Holt Mich Hier Raus’ must be German for ‘gratuitous shower scene’ Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied The German I’m A Celebrity camera operators have a tendency to linger. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nIt’s basically the natural heir to our own \nBig Brother Uncut \n, that early noughties program in which Gretel Killeen lustily narrated what amounted to an hour-long hidden cam peep show. Black bars not model’s own. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nAnd funnily enough, all this German nude celebrity action happens not in the wilds of Africa but right here in Australia — in a national park on the NSW / Queensland border, to be exact. Contestants in the UK version of the show — pictured above — also decamp to the Northern New South Wales ‘jungle’. Picture: Splash News Source: Splash News Australia \nConsider this a peek at how \nCeleb \nviewers overseas live it up. Feel free to refer back to this article the next time Lisa Curry pulls out her crochet on Aussie \nI’m A Celeb \nStill, at least we’ve got Kris Smith ... Dannii’s babydaddy is bringing some heat to the jungle.
