Abu Dhabi Criminal Court of First instance heard on Tuesday that the Emirati man found two Moroccan women stuck on a road in Wathba area after their car had an engine problem when they asked for his help. Official records stated that the man took the women in his car to a nearby fuel station to get a mechanic. Unfortunately they couldn't find one since it was late in the night. The Moroccans were allegedly coming from a trip and their home was located far from the area where their car got a problem. The second woman, a friend of the victim who was with her in the car, told prosecutors that when they failed to get a mechanic to fix their car, they had opted to go back and sleep in their car till morning since their home was far. She noted that the Emirati however insisted that he should take them to a hotel where they would stay for a night and have their car fixed in the next day. \"He took us to one hotel and booked a room for the two of us and then left,\" said the witness. \"And after an hour, he returned to our room and told us that he would only rest in the hotel lounge for a few hours since it was already past midnight and had some important work to do in the morning.\" The woman said when she woke up after mid-day leaving her friend in the room and went for Dhuhur prayer, she found the Emirati seated in the hotel lounge. \"After prayer, I returned to the hotel room but found when the man was inside the room molesting my friend and trying to kiss her by force,\" she said. \"I tried to stop him telling him to leave the woman alone but he refused.\" The witness said when she went out of the room after her friend asked her to phone police or call security men, the man locked the door and raped the woman. She added: \"When I returned with the hotel's security man, he knocked the door but the man refused to open it as he was still attacking my friend.\" \"I could hear her screaming.\" And when the security officer hurried to phone police, the man fled the hotel. Police later arrested the Emirati after the victim filed a complaint against him. A medical report confirmed that the woman was raped. The man however denied the charge of rape. The trial was adjourned to a future date. ismail@khaleejtimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:38:13.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
