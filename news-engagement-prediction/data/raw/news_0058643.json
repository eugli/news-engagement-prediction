Some 90 vacant positions won't be filled.\nAccording to Alyse Stuart, the chair of the Common Front NL lobby group, that loss of work will also touch businesses around the province.\nAlyse Stuart is the chair of Common Front NL, a lobby group comprised of labour organizations and other groups.

We simply can't afford to have the largest public service of any province in Canada,\" said Richard Alexander, head of the Newfoundland and Labrador Employers' Council.\nRichard Alexander is the head of the Newfoundland and Labrador Employers Council. (CBC)\nThe employers' council launched a campaign last year to advocate for layoffs in the public sector. Alexander said cuts are just one step the government needs to take to reduce the deficit.\n\"It's absolutely critical that they hit their deficit reduction targets through expenditure reductions,\" he said.\n\"If they don't do that, if they don't start hitting those targets, they're going to be back to taxpayers looking for more tax increases.\"\nDorothy Keating, chair of the St. John's Board of Trade, said it's always difficult when people lose their jobs.\n\"Our hearts go out to those that are impacted by the decision of the government, but it was absolutely a necessary decision that has to happen as part of the process to fiscal sustainability for our province.\"\nAnd while Wednesday's cuts targeted only managers in core government services and not union jobs, NAPE president Jerry Earle said there will still be an impact in the broader public sector, especially if the consolidation of some departments means uprooting employees.\nNewfoundland Premier Dwight Ball and Finance Minister Cathy Bennett announce cuts to the province's civil service Wednesday. (Philippe Grenier/CBC)\nThe lands branch of the Department of Municipal Affairs, for example, will now fall under the department of Fisheries and Lands Resources. The office will also move from St. John's to Corner Brook, affecting 30 positions.\n\"It's easy to say they'll still have a job, but the problem is that they could have kids in school, they may have a family home,\" said Earle. \"We're in an economy now where you have difficulty selling homes, so even that is a negative impact on individuals.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:10:19.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
