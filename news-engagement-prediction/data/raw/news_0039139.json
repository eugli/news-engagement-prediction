Some generous folks who have access to both Photoshop and Elements have created add-ons and tools that will allow Elements to use some of these features. See the Add-ons and Tools for Enhancing Photoshop Elements section to learn more about how to get these tools. \nPhotoshop Elements also offers some features that are not available in Photoshop such as: Cookie cutter tool Drop-in frames, backgrounds, and artwork Additional Photomerge modes, like Group Shot, Scene Cleaner, Faces, and Style Match Guided Edits and Quick Fix mode Multi-file processing without the need to record an action Automatically divide scanned photos Photo creation templates for photo books, greeting cards, calendars, and more. Easy online sharing options for Facebook, Flickr, etc. A powerful Photo Organizer \nThe Photo Organizer (Windows-only in Photoshop Elements 8 and under) lets you organize your photos with keyword tags , then search and share them. The Organizer also offers several types of creations for sharing your photos in slide shows, video CDs, cards, email, calendars, Web galleries, and photo books. \nIn addition, most Photoshop-compatible Plug-ins and Filters will also work with Photoshop Elements. Photoshop Elements users who are aware of the limitations noted above can also take advantage of the many Photoshop Tutorials found on the Web. \nIf you are still undecided about which version to purchase, you can download time-limited but fully functional trial versions of both programs from the Adobe Web site. Editor's Note: \nThis discussion is relevant if you are using the boxed version of Photoshop. In 2013, Adobe switched over to the Creative Cloud subscription service. For a monthly fee, you can download and install all of the Adobe products to your desktop. Coupled with this are regular, no fee, updates to all of Adobe's products. Since then there have been a serious number of Photoshop updates and feature additions. The real issue around choosing Photoshop Elements - current version is Photoshop Elements 14 - revolves around what you need to do. If you are a serious graphic designer that does heavy-duty image editing and effects, then your choice is Photoshop CC - 2015.5 release. If you find Photoshop's feature set and techniques to either be intimidating or not for you, then Photoshop Elements is a great way to start. Either way, it comes down to personal choice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:11:25.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
