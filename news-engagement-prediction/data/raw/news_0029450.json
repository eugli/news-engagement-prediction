The gang marred what had otherwise been a harmonious event. Source: Facebook \nHis mother, Debbie Tesoriero, told the Herald-Sun he has no recollection of the attack. \n“He was just an innocent bystander,” Ms Tesoriero said. \n“We’re very fortunate it wasn’t worse. As a parent this is terrifying.” \nFestival-goer Joe Cuic described the rampage as “hectic”. \n“Out of nowhere, everyone’s gone from standing there watching, having a lovely time, to people just running in all directions,” he said. \nHe told Seven News he saw some of the youths throwing rocks at a nearby apartment building after leaving the festival grounds. \n“They realised we were not police and just turned around and started mouthing off to us. Give us the finger and, yeah, just couldn't care less,” Mr Cuic said. \nVictoria Police said six people had reported having their phones stolen and two had reported being assaulted, however, the numbers are believed to be much higher.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T03:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:07:20.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
