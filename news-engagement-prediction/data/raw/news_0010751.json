(Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images) ORG XMIT: 694911629 ORIG FILE ID: 633949140 (Photo: Patrick Smith, Getty Images) \nTom Brady threw his first pick-six in seven Super Bowl appearances, and it gave Atlanta a commanding 21-0 lead near the end of the second quarter. \nIt was a rare bad - awful, really - read by Brady, who either simply didn't seen Robert Alford or assumed Danny Amendola would run a more shallow route and cut the ball off. Either way, it left him charging over to try to make a tackle. \nAnd after a leaping attempt - a truly admirable attempt - he went skidding across the turf, having accomplished nothing. \nHere now, we gratuitously offer you every possible photo angle of this valiant failure. \nHere's the thing: Brady looks about 50 times more athletic there that he did at the combine when he came out of college ( something he claims is true ). He's 39. What a marvel. \nAnd also: If you've ever tried that hard at something in your life, take a moment to reflect. You are exceptional.
