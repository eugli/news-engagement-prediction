On Monday, the Hamilton creator shared a Spotify playlist that he put together just in time for Galentine’s Day, aka the Leslie Knope-inspired holiday in which women, single or taken, come together to celebrate being friends. \nThe playlist includes powerful female-penned anthems including Queen Latifah’s “U.N.I.T.Y.,” Florence + The Machine’s “Dog Days Are Over,” and even “Ring of Keys,” from Lisa Kron’s musical, Fun Home . Miranda also included iconic girl groups like Destiny’s Child, SWV, and The Pointer Sisters.
