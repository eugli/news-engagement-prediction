Known as a willowy beauty, Elizabeth Clough was one of 25 girls who made history in 1968 by ending the all-male tradition of the English public school. She joined 800 boys at Marlborough College — which now costs £35,280 per year — setting a path that would be followed by the Duchess of Cambridge and Samantha Cameron, among many other prominent women. ‘I had the pick of all the debating societies, read out my poems in literary groups and was generally lionised by virtue of my sex,’ she later recalled. The break-up is a bitter blow for Elizabeth, (centre) who never received a wedding ring from Paxman despite making great sacrifices for the relationship ‘I went out with the head boy, Nigel, who was very charming. His position gave him certain privileges. That was the only romance I had, because after Nigel, all the boys my age seemed totally callow and unsophisticated.’ She then went up to Oxford to read history at Somerville College. Malvern College-educated Paxman was at Cambridge. ‘After Marlborough, Oxford was a huge disappointment,’ she said. ‘The men weren’t the gods I was expecting, they were no more mature than the boys I’d been at school with.’ After graduating, Elizabeth joined the BBC as a trainee. She later worked on Panorama, Watchdog and Newsnight, where she met Paxman. He went on to become one of the BBC’s highest-paid presenters, signing a four-year deal with the broadcaster in 2010, worth £3.2 million. However, he announced in 2014 that he was to leave Newsnight. Paxman had told BBC Director-General Tony Hall that he wished to quit the previous year, but agreed to stay on after the show was damaged by the Jimmy Savile scandal and the Lord McAlpine fiasco. Speaking at the Chalke Valley History Festival in 2014, Paxman complained that Newsnight was made by idealistic ‘13-year-olds’ who foolishly thought they could ‘change the world’. Mentioning no names Which England rugby star, who has a loyal, long-standing girlfriend, was seen leaving a seedy Kensington massage parlour known to provide optional ‘extras’? Will a wedding end the Howards' war? Castle Howard, where classic Eighties drama Brideshead Revisited was filmed, couldn’t be a more magnificent setting for a family reconciliation. Unwelcome prediction of the week ‘Harry will wake up on the floor one day and realise that she loves herself so much there’s no room for him in the bed.’ - Samantha Grant on her half-sister Meghan Markle, Prince Harry’s girlfriend London restaurateur George Howard — whose father, Nicholas, took over the 10,000-acre North Yorkshire estate from his younger brother Simon amid much acrimony — has become engaged. And the wedding could help bring together the warring family. George, 31, is to marry the American artist Elissa Goldstone, also 31, and his father tells me: ‘I couldn’t be more pleased. Elissa is a fabulous person. I look forward to the festivities.’ Simon, 61, who had presided over the estate for 30 years, was forced out last summer with his wife, Marks & Spencer heiress Rebecca. This followed a coup by Nicholas and his wife, Victoria, former chief executive of publishing giant HarperCollins. A family friend remarked at the time: ‘This makes Cain and Abel look like a fairy tale.’ Men used to walk out of the room when author Fay Weldon entered because they were so outraged by her feminist books Men used to walk out of the room when author Fay Weldon entered because they were so outraged by her feminist books. But the revolution has gone so far that young women now hold themselves in too high regard, she claims. Weldon, whose novel The Life And Loves Of A She-Devil was turned into a hit Hollywood film starring Meryl Streep, says: ‘I think we should be teaching them low self-esteem.’ The 85-year-old author teaches creative writing at Bath Spa University and says of her students: ‘What makes it difficult to teach them is their high self-esteem. If they had a bit of low self-esteem, or a bit of modesty . . . enough of this sharp-elbowing people out of the way.’ Share or comment on this article 13", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:18:33.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
