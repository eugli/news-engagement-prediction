She seemed her normal self and I left to go home and that was the last time I ever saw her. She had everything to live for and she loved taking her girls horse-riding and was planning her wedding to Chris in May. \n“She had a caring personality and loved all her children. We cannot explain why she did what she did. She was very depressed and we think she acted on the spur of the moment.

Her only concern was access to her daughters. She was granted access, but it was a tiring and stressful process. \n“Sometimes she was positive about it but she didn’t like going to court and having her past bought up again. \n\"Both sets of parents regularly helped with child care and she was positive about the future.
