The latest we’ve spotted is on Amazon — $16 for a 64GB card from SanDisk or $48 for a Samsung 128GB . \nThe SanDisk card is usually priced at $40, so you are saving yourself quite a bit on this purchase. Should you need any additional storage (no judgement), you can get a 256GB card from SanDisk for $135. Those usually run $199, so as I stated in the headline, now’s a good time to buy. \nFor the Samsung 128GB microSD card, the standard price is $103. Now at $48, you are saving yourself over 50%, and for that much storage, you’ll thank yourself later. Samsung also has a range of different sizes available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:13:43.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
