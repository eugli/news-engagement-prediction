The trouble is there’s never been a bunny cop. Judy must convince big, strong officers that she’s not just some “cute” bunny to earn a position on the force. She enlists the help of Nick Wilde — a sly scam artist of a fox fighting against his own species’ stereotypes — in a 48-hour bid to solve the case of the missing animals.\n“We got this idea about five and a half, six years ago to talk about bias with talking animals,” the film’s co-director Byron Howard said following the win, adding that using animals prevented audiences from prejudging the characters.\nHoward credited a well-known ancient Greek fable-writer for the original idea.\nCo-directors Byron Howard and Rich Moore and producer Clark Spencer, winners of the best animated feature film award for “Zootopia,” pose for photos Sunday with their golden statuettes. (Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) “Aesop knew this hundreds of years ago, and it was something that animation is very uniquely equipped to do,” Howard said. “We were surprised by how timely the film became as the world sort of blew up.” Howard was referring to a number of police shootings in the past two years that increased tension between black people and white people.\nCo-director Rich Moore said he is grateful to audiences for embracing a “story of tolerance being more powerful than fear of the other.”\n“Zootopia” was widely considered the front-runner in the animation category, taking home six trophies at the Annie Awards — the awards hosted by the International Animated Film Society — and snagging a Golden Globe. The film earned more than $1 billion at the box office.\nThe film features an all-star vocal cast including Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Shakira, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Jenny Slate and Octavia Spencer.\nThe other nominees were “Kubo and the Two Strings,” ‘’Moana,” ‘’The Red Turtle” and “My Life as a Zucchini.”\nThe Academy Award winner of the best animated short film was “Piper,” a computer-animated movie by Pixar about a baby sandpiper.\n0 Comments Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share via Email 0 Show Comments Discussion Policy 0 Comments SuperFan Badge\nSuperFan badge holders consistently post smart, timely comments about Washington area sports and teams.\nMore about badges | Request a badge\nCulture Connoisseur Badge\nCulture Connoisseurs consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on the arts, lifestyle and entertainment.\nMore about badges | Request a badge\nFact Checker Badge\nFact Checkers contribute questions, information and facts to The Fact Checker .\nMore about badges | Request a badge\nWashingtologist Badge\nWashingtologists consistently post thought-provoking, timely comments on events, communities, and trends in the Washington area.\nMore about badges | Request a badge\nPost Writer Badge\nThis commenter is a Washington Post editor, reporter or producer.\nPost Forum Badge\nPost Forum members consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on politics, national and international affairs.\nMore about badges | Request a badge\nWeather Watcher Badge\nWeather Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on climates and forecasts.\nMore about badges | Request a badge\nWorld Watcher Badge\nWorld Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on international affairs.\nMore about badges | Request a badge\nPost Contributor Badge\nThis commenter is a Washington Post contributor.
