(Photo: AFP) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nEuropean politicians were among the harshest critics of President Trump's travel ban on refugees and nationals from seven countries with Muslim majorities. Yet new research shows that a majority of European people would applaud similar measures. \nFifty-five percent of 10,000 people surveyed in 10 European countries support the idea that all further migration from mainly Muslim countries should be stopped. The survey was carried out by Chatham House, a well-respected London-based foreign affairs think tank. \n\"Our results are striking and sobering,\" the researchers write in the study. \"They suggest that public opposition to any further migration from predominantly Muslim states is by no means confined to Trump’s electorate in the U.S. but is fairly widespread.\" \nAccording to a Morning Consult/Politico survey of U.S. registered voters published this week, even as Trump's approval ratings have soured since he has taken office, a similar amount of Americans — 55% — approve of his executive order on immigration that bans refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days and Syrians indefinitely. \nBut Chatham House, which conducted its survey before Trump's order was announced, found that public opposition in Europe to further immigration from Muslim areas is especially intense in some European countries despite the backlash it has generated among many of the region's leaders. It ranges from 71% in Poland to 41% in Spain. \nIn Germany, which let in nearly a million asylum seekers last year from predominantly Muslim countries, it is 53%. \nPublic opposition to further migration from Muslim was also strong in Austria (65%), Hungary (64%), France (61%) and Belgium (64%) — all countries that in recent years have either been at the center of Europe's refugee crisis or seen major terrorist attacks linked to nationals from Muslim countries. In Britain, 47% would back a Trump-style ban. \nSo strong was German Chancellor Angela Merkel's opposition to the ban, the study notes, she \"explained the United Nations Refugee Convention to the president in a phone call discussing the order, while London Mayor Sadiq Khan argued that the invitation to the president for a state visit to Britain in 2017 should be withdrawn until the ban is rescinded.\" CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k6LIvm NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.
