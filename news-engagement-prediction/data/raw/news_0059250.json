Well, wish no more. The Fort Collins, Colo., brewery finally pushed distribution east of the Mississippi River, and landed in Illinois in February. Founded in 1989, Odell is a classic craft brand with a broad and sturdy portfolio. Even in an industry awash in IPAs, Odell's is a particular standout.\nIn the bottle: If you're looking for a trendy, heavily citrus forward IPA, this isn't the beer for you. Instead, like most quality beers, Odell IPA thrives on its balance. The beer walks a bitter-fruity line, with elements of orange peel and grapefruit pith tied in with notes of grassy pine, a dash of dank resin and just enough of a caramel malt body to tie it all together. Odell IPA also drinks a bit lighter and more refreshingly than its alcohol content.\nAlcohol: 7 percent\nPair with: Odell IPA would shine beside something decadent and rich that stands up to its pungency â€” like a thick, juicy hamburger topped with blue cheese.\nFind it: Odell IPA is available in six-packs of 12-ounce cans or bottles at better beer stores.\nMore information: www.odellbrewing.com\njbnoel@tribpub.com\nTwitter @joshbnoel\nAfter trying 32 kinds of xiaolongbao, reporter Louisa Chu compiled her list of the best places to try them in Chicago.\nFirst, we found the best hot chocolate in Chicago .
