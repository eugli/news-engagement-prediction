According to the Cambridge native’s Sunday night red carpet remarks, the shaggy look isn’t a personal choice—it’s for an upcoming role.\n“I’m working right now, is why I have this beard,” Affleck told Vanity Fair ‘s executive editor Krista Smith on ABC’s Oscars red carpet broadcast. “I know it’s not a great look. But I’m stuck with it for a few weeks.”\nWhile Affleck didn’t specify which project required him to maintain a mountain man look, a likely culprit is Light of My Life , a film written, directed by, and starring Affleck as a man stuck in the woods with his daughter. According to IMDbPro , Light of My Life is currently filming, and will likely be released in 2018.", "external_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6063090"], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:27:19.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
