RIGHT: President Uhuru Kenyatta By NAIROBI NEWS REPORTER \nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta has been overlooked as United States President Donald Trump is set to make his maiden phone calls to African leaders since he was sworn in on January 20 this year. \nPresident Trump, according to VOA , will speak to the presidents of Nigeria and South Africa by phone Monday. The topics of the conversation was not disclosed. \nHowever, it is important to note that majority of Kenyans hoped for Trump’s rival Hilary Clinton’s victory. \nAs a result, although he is the leader of the free world, unlike his predecessor Barack Obama who was deemed to be progressive, a call with the incumbent US president would not mean much. \nIt would, however, be translated to mean endorsement for Jubilee government which is facing several crises ahead of the August 8 general election. \nTrump will speak first to Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari before phoning South African President Jacob Zuma.
