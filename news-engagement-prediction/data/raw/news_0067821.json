But it appears while the Pacers were talking to other teams about George, they weren’t keeping the 26-year-old up to date about where he might go. \nGeorge spoke to reporters after practice Thursday and expressed his frustrations about how the team handled the situation. \n“I kind of was on the ropes just like you guys were on what was about to happen,” George said. “It was kind of a dark moment of uncertainty. That was the frustrating part. You want me to be your guy here, I thought I would be in the loop a little more than that.” Interesting quote from #Pacers Paul George on today's trade deadline. pic.twitter.com/bMA5rHlWUB \n— Clark Wade (@ClarkWade34) February 23, 2017 \nThe Celtics and Pacers reportedly had advanced discussions about a trade involving George, but that didn’t materialize before the 3 p.m. ET deadline. George, who has been with the Pacers his entire seven-year career in the NBA, can become an unrestricted free agent next summer, and many believe he will leave Indiana and head to his hometown team – the L.A. Lakers. \nGeorge dismissed that notion Thursday. \n“That’s what people are going to think,” George said. “Of course, I’m from L.A. There are ties, there are connections. But you can’t jump to a conclusion based off that. If that was the case, I wouldn’t have took a long extension here.” Watch: Is #Pacers Paul George headed to L.A.? PG responds.
