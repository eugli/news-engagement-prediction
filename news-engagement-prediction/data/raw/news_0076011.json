On Sunday, “Hidden Fences” returned at the Oscars . \nThis time, it was People’s editorial director, Jess Cagle, who made the unfortunate flub. Cagle corrected himself right away, but folks on Twitter didn’t let him get off too easy. \nComedian Travon Free called him out: I knew we'd get our #HiddenFences before the night was over. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/NXpfg7JVmu — Travon Free (@Travon) February 27, 2017 \nAs did “Bad Feminist” author, Roxane Gay: Holy shit. The editor of People just said Hidden Fences.
