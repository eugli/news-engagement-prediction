They knew it would come to an end very quickly. \n“There is something very poignant and potent about this particular place and the idea of the caravan and the sense of being moved on.” \nThe club, in a basement in Endell Street near Covent Garden, was run by Billy Reynolds and a former strongman and escapologist called Jack Neave, known as “Iron Foot Jack” because of the metal platform he wore to compensate for a shortened leg. \nRecords in the National Archives reveal the Metropolitan police had it under surveillance from October 1933 after a series of complaints. Police appear to have been stationed in the Shaftesbury Theatre opposite, watching the comings and goings from unused offices.

Many of the young men there were working class – labourers, shop assistants, waiters – and the majority were found not guilty in court on condition they never frequented such a club again. \nThere was, however, no leniency for Reynolds and Neave, respectively given sentences of 12 months and 20 months hard labour in prison.

It is one of a number of events being held across the UK to mark the 50th anniversary of the Sexual Offences Act , the landmark moment which decriminalised private homosexual acts between men over 21 in England and Wales. \nIt will be the endpoint of walking tours of Soho featuring long-gone venues, such as Billie’s Club on Little Denmark Street and the Shim Sham Club, now an O’Neill’s but in the 1930s a gay friendly jazz venue even more shocking because it was frequented by black men “dancing with white women”.
