Mitch McConnell (R-KY) speaks during a news conference at the Capitol February 17, 2017 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Alex Wong/Getty Images \nAt a press conference on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he does not see the media as the enemy. His view differs from that of President Donald Trump, who recently called a handful of news organizations the \"enemy of the American People.\" \n“I don’t view you guys as the enemy. I view that you have a job to do,” McConnell told reporters during a press conference on Thursday. \nThe Kentucky senator said that he \"expects adversarial questions\" from the press. \"You rarely disappoint me,\" McConnell said. \nHe added: \"I think it's part of what makes America function ... We need a free press and an open press and we certainly have that.\" \nMcConnell made the comments the same day White House chief strategist Steve Bannon repeated his description of the media as the \"opposition party\" in front of an audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington that \nWhen asked for his opinion on the President's views, McConnell said: \"I’m not a fan of all the extra chatter, I’ve been quite candid about that.\" McConnell suggested he has offered Trump advice about squashing his Twitter rants, but the senator added, \"he’s not interested in my advice on tweeting.\" \nTrump will address Congress on Tuesday, where McConnell hopes he will offer an \"optimistic and uplifting message about where America needs to go.\" \nMcConnell and other Republican lawmakers have faced increasingly hostile crowds at their local town hall meetings of late. \nWhile Trump has claimed on Twitter that the protesters were organized liberals , McConnell conceded that \"wherever they came from, we welcome them.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T14:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:23:25.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
