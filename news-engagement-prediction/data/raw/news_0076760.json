Only so many players can be protected on each roster — either seven forwards, three defensemen and one goaltender, or eight skaters (forwards/defensemen) and a goaltender. Vegas must pick at least 14 forwards, nine defensemen and three goalies, but can only pick one player from each of the existing 30 NHL franchises. Protection lists are due June 17. Vegas must submit selections by June 20. \nThe Wings are expected to use the 11-player formula. Whom will they protect? Today’s focal point: Goaltenders. \nRelated: Detroit Red Wings trade Tomas Jurco to Chicago for 3rd-round pick \nProtect: Petr Mrazek, but only if he continues to shore up his game. It is problematic he has lost the starting job two years running . A big reason why the Wings are out of the playoff picture is how poorly Mrazek has played much of this season. He finally started to look good in his recent starts, although he’s still giving up one bad goal a game. His numbers – 2.98 goals-against average, .902 save percentage in 37 games – have disappointed since the Wings declared Mrazek the No. 1 guy last summer. He is under contract through next season, at $4 million. \nExpose: Jared Coreau, Jimmy Howard. If Mrazek does not trend in the right direction the rest of the season, then protect Coreau and expose Mrazek. Coreau has been as inconsistent as Mrazek – in 13 games, Coreau has two shutouts , but also a 3.27 goals-against average and .893 save percentage – but Coreau is a lot cheaper, signed through next season at just $612,500. Howard was playing the best hockey of his career when he was injured in a collision on Dec. 20, with a 1.96 goals-against average and .934 save percentage in 17 games. He also is going to be 33 on March 26, and he has two years left on a contract with a $5.3 million cap hit. \nRelated: Detroit Red Wings' Jared Coreau to minors; Jimmy Howard behind \nWorth noting: Coreau is finishing up his fourth year of pro hockey, ending his waiver exemption. The Wings need to shed one goaltender, if not through the expansion draft, then via trade. If Howard is able to come back and continue playing as well as he was, it would help his trade value. If not, Mrazek could be shopped, and the Wings would go into next season with Howard and Coreau.
