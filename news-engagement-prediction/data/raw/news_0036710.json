The senators were tight-lipped as they left the meeting to start their week-long recess, but one attendee said the closed-door briefing was about Russia. Lawmakers have been working swiftly behind the scenes to set the scope of their investigations -- which now number three -- into Russia's influence in the US elections. Pressure grew on Congress to expand their focus this week following reports that Russian officials were in frequent contact with President Donald Trump's campaign during the election. Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence committee, did not answer questions about the focus of the Comey briefing Friday. But he did talk about the extent of the investigation he is building with Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr.

This is so important that we get it right,\" Warner said. \"But the amount of manipulation, why there's not more outrage about the fact there were close to 1,000 Russian internet trolls, actual people, working trying to manipulate our news.\" Warner also said the committee has put in place a process to ensure the White House does not destroy documents lawmakers need for their investigation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:19:15.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
