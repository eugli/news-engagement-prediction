Could   \nAmanda Knox has opened up about her lesbian relationship with an inmate while locked up in an Italian prison. \nKnox was 22 when she was jailed for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher who was brutally stabbed to death at the apartment they shared in Perugia. \nThe verdict was later quashed and Knox returned to the US in 2011. \nShe now writes columns and advocates for the wrongly convicted. The prison in Perugia where Knox was locked up (Photo: Wikipedia Commons) \nTo mark Valentine's Day, Knox, now aged 29, wrote about her experience of romance in prison for Broadly. \nShe says she had a brief fling with a female inmate she called \"Leny\". \n\"I noticed her immediately: petite, with a paunchy belly and short, dark hair,\" Knox wrote. \nKnox said Leny soon told her she was a lesbian and was delighted when Knox said she had supported LGBT campaigns in school. \n\"Afterwards, she scampered, puppy-like, alongside me as I paced the exercise yard—the next day, and the day after that, and eventually every day.\" Knox said the woman \"scampered, puppy-like, alongside me as I paced the yard\" (Photo: Reuters) \n\"So I let Leny listen to my CDs. \n\"I taught her how to play chess. \n\"When Leny got a janitorial job, she loitered outside my cell for a sip of espresso and a chat whenever she was on break.\" \nKnox said romance between women in prison was common, even if the majority in relationships would have identified as heterosexual. \nThey would say they were \"Gay for the stay\", according to Knox.

'I can do things to you that no man can.' \n\"I felt objectified and I'd get annoyed. 'You can't change me,' I'd respond.\" \nLeny eventually kissed Knox and she said she felt \"embarrassment and anger\". \n\"I told Leny that since she couldn't respect my boundaries, we couldn't be friends anymore,\" she concluded.
