Rodriguez is set to play Gelda, whom the outlet describes as a slim cyborg warrior in the source material. This marks Rodriguez’s third collaboration with the director following the two Machete films. \nShe joins a cast that includes Rosa Salazar in the title role, along with Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz, Jackie Earl Haley, Ed Skrein , Eiza Gonzales, Lana Condor, Leonard Wu, Jennifer Connelly, and Mahershala Ali. \nSet in the 26th century, Alita: Battle Angel tells the story of Alita, an amnesiac female cyborg who is rescued from a scrapyard by Dyson. The rebuilt Alita, remembering only her training in a deadly martial art, becomes a hunter-warrior, tracking down and eliminating vicious criminals. Within the context of an epic action-adventure, the film aims to explore a young woman’s journey of self-discovery and finding love. \nJames Cameron had been developing the big screen adaptation for more than a decade, but now that he’s is in pre-production on four Avatar sequels, he has his hands a little full and has turned the Alita reins over to Sin City director Robert Rodriguez . The film is now in post-production and slated for a July 20, 2018 release. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:43:29.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
