ABT-1915 owned by the victim and falsification of public document over the victim’s death certificate on Oct. 19, 2016 in Caloocan City. \nThe DOJ panel set the next hearing on March 2 at 2 p.m. where the respondents are set to file their respective counter-affidavits in response to the accusations against them. \nA complaint for complex crime of kidnapping for ransom with homicide has been filed before the Pampanga court against SP03 Ricky Sta. Isabel, SPO4 Roy Villegas and Ramon Yalung. The court, however, allowed a reinvestigation and gave the DOJ panel up to April 19.
