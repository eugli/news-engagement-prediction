It was one of those performances that earned the \"nominee\" tag the minute the credits first rolled.

Soon, many outlets followed suit, and some Oscar voters, women in particular, began saying privately that they could not support him. \nThen at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, the top honor went to Denzel Washington, for Fences . It began to look like Affleck was indeed vulnerable. \nInstead, his name was called. \nAffleck was humble and demurring in his acceptance speech: \"Man, I wish I had something bigger and more meaningful to say ... I really love this community and I'm just dumbfoudned to be included.\" \nDenzel Washington arrives at the 89th Annual Academy Awards on Sunday. \nImage: Christopher Polk/Getty ImagesGetty Images \nAffleck also shouted out Washington, an early mentor. \n\"One of the first people who taught me about acting was Denzel Washington, so. Thank you,\" Affleck said. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:09:05.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
