Who needs ceilings?! #hailstorm #sydney \nMr Fuller said hailstorms are expected at this time of year but Saturday's was \"certainly a big one\". \nFortunately, the damage is far off matching the Anzac Day 2015 hailstorms which cost $421 million in insured losses, or the storm last November which caused $272 million in insured damages. \nMr Fuller said anyone who had suffered damage and thought they needed to lodge an insurance claim should do so as soon as possible. \nAnyone with general inquiries about the claims process can call the ICA's disaster hotline on 1800 734 621. \nThree severe thunderstorms swept the state's east coast yesterday afternoon and people took to social media to share photos of large hail, which one Twitter user described as the \"biggest hail I've ever seen\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T11:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:48:15.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
