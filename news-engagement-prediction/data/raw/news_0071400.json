You can check out the original announcement for the two devices if you want, or the detailed specs article for the Huawei P10 . We’re here to take an in-depth look at the Huawei P10 Plus’ specifications. Before we begin, however, it’s worth mentioning that the phone’s specs are rather similar to the specs on the Huawei P10, so keep that in mind and read on. \nThe Huawei P10 Plus is made out of metal, just like the Huawei P10, and it looks almost identical to its smaller sibling, save for the fact it has a larger display. The Huawei P10 Plus features a 5.5-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) IPS LCD display. The device’s fingerprint scanner is located below its display, and the company’s logo lies on the back. Speaking of its fingerprint scanner, you’ll be able to assign various gestures to it, so making a certain gesture on the fingerprint scanner can result, for example, in opening up the camera app, or whatever else you want. The Huawei P10 Plus also packs in 4GB / 6GB of RAM and 64GB / 128GB of expandable internal storage. The device is fueled by the Kirin 960 64-bit octa-core processor, same as the Huawei P10 and Huawei Mate 9, and that is currently Huawei’s most powerful chip, at least until they introduce the Kirin 970 later this year. \nOn the back of the Huawei P10 Plus, you’ll be able to find two camera sensors with Leica’s lenses on top of them, a 20-megapixel (monochrome) and 12-megapixel (RGB) snappers are placed there. As you can see, Huawei opted for different sensors compared to the Huawei Mate 9 here, though the base principal of utilizing those cameras remains unchanged. A dual-LED, dual-tone flash lies next to the two camera sensors, and Huawei’s branding is also placed on the back of this phone. An 8-megapixel shooter is available on the front side of the device, along with an LED flash, and like the Huawei P10, this camera is covered by one of Leica’s lenses as well, as these two are the first Huawei-branded smartphones to ship with Leica’s lenses even on the front side. A 3,750mAh battery comes with the device as well, and it is not removable, though it supports fast charging. Android 7.0 Nougat is pre-installed on the Huawei P10 Plus, along with Emotion UI (EMUI) 5.1, Huawei’s newly-announced variant of EMUI. The Huawei P10 Plus will be available in Ceramic White, Dazzling Blue, Dazzling Gold, Graphite Black, Mystic Silver, Rose Gold and Greenery color options. Huawei says that this is the world’s first 4.5G smartphone, and the device measures 153.5 x 74.2 x 6.98 mm, while it weighs 165 grams.
