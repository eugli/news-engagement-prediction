Theresa May pictured here with President Erdogan is serious about Brexit If the UK wanted to re-join the EU in the future, it would have to re-apply under Article 49 TEU Commons Report \nThe report states: \"There is no provision for withdrawing the notification, but many analysts believe Article 50 is revocable and that the UK could change its mind about leaving the EU after notification and before actually withdrawing. \n\"The revocability of Article 50 TEU was not raised in the Miller case before the High Court, but could be important. \n\"If the UK wanted to re-join the EU in the future, it would have to re-apply under Article 49 TEU\". \nHowever when probed about the advice that was handed out to politicians and policy planners a Downing Street spokesman flatly denied there is any backdoor contingency plan being developed. \nHe said: \"We have been clear that we are committed to delivering on the will of the people and leaving the European Union. \n\"There can be no attempts to remain inside the EU and no attempt to re-join it. \n\"We want the best deal for the whole of the UK. \n\"It is in no one’s interests for there to be a cliff-edge for business or indeed for the rest of the country. \n\"We want a phased process of implementation, in which both Britain and the EU institutions and member states prepare for the new arrangements that exist between us.\" \nTheresa May is currently buoyed after the Conservatives shock election victory in the Copeland by-election. \nTory Trudy Harrison won with 13,748 votes to 11,601 for Labour's Gillian Troughton. \nMrs May is also riding high with positive approval ratings as Jeremy Corbyn continues to fight off controversy in the crumbling Labour party. \nDuring the Article 50 Commons Vote two weeks ago there was drama with high profile resignations from the Labour front benches. \nThe Conservative government sailed through the process with a comfortable win with 494 votes in favour to 122 against. \nThe only Tory rebel to vote against the Government was Ken Clarke who had previously announced he enjoyed the limelight he’d been receiving as a result of his stance. \nNo one from the SNP denied party orders to vote against the bill after Nicola Sturgeon’s posturing however it has already been ruled that devolved assemblies do not have a say after the Supreme Court judgement. Brexit: Which parts of the UK had the majority vote? Fri, February 17, 2017 Much of the North East of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union including Sunderland, Gateshead, Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, and Northumberland. Newcastle was the only borough to vote to remain. Getty Images 1 of 8 GREAT YARMOUTH: The town of Great Yarmouth on the East Coast of England voted by 72% to leave the European Union. \nA total of 616 MPs cast their vote on the issue with a total of 34 who did not take the opportunity out of the 650 constituencies in the United Kingdom. \nIn terms of percentages the Government won the vote by 80.2 per cent to 19.8 per cent. \nThe draft legislation is now set to move to the House of Lords but is a comfortable win for the Conservative party who will now be buoyed in their Brexit negotiations with the EU.
