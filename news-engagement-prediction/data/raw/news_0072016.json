Image caption Rumours about Cheryl's pregnancy started back in October after Liam Payne changed his Twitter profile \nThe Prince's Trust says it launched the campaign after a study it carried out suggested that one in three young people don't believe in themselves. \nThe Prince's Trust and L'Oreal Paris have employed 15 inspirational ambassadors, including former X Factor champion Louisa Johnson and YouTube vlogger Marcus Butler, who've dealt with confidence issues. \nCheryl said: \"As a long-standing supporter of The Prince's Trust and spokesperson for L'Oreal Paris I am so happy to support this partnership. \n\"Young people are currently facing more and more problems with self-confidence and we have to address these issues as a real priority. \n\"My hope is that this partnership will help young people feel accepted and valued for who they are and make sure that they get the support they need to make the most out of life.\" \nThe confidence training programme will form part of The Prince's Trust's existing courses running in 18 of its centres every three months. \nLearning materials will also be available online for young people in need. \nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:31:27.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
