The U.S. Embassy in Seoul did not have comment. \nThe meeting in New York would have been the first time a senior North Korean envoy would visit the United States since 2011 and the first contact between U.S. and North Korean representatives since Trump took office. \nChoe, director general for North American affairs at the North’s foreign ministry, has previously met former U.s. officials and academics, the last time in November in Geneva for informal discussions. \nTrump said in a Reuters interview on Thursday that he was concerned about North Korea’s ballistic missile tests and “it’s a very dangerous situation”. Trump did not ruling out meeting Kim at some point in the future under certain circumstances but suggested it might be too late. \n(Reporting by Jack Kim and Tony Munroe) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T11:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:58:11.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
