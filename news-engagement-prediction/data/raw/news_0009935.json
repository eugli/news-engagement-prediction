I am a Paramedic in the NHS and have served and helped the public in their most desperate times for the past 20 years. Now the tables have turned and it is my family that desperately needs the help of the public and that’s why we have set up this GoFundMe appeal .” The 15-year-old's family are deeply upset that the surgery was \"taken away from her last minute\" \nThe curves in Lucy’s back are currently at 55 & 60 degrees in the shape of an ‘S’ and if left un-corrected will increase and stiffen with time leaving her with chronic back pain. \nDue to the twisting nature of scoliosis her ribcage is also rotated and this has produced a visible ‘rib hump’ on the left hand side of her back and a protruding right shoulder blade. \nMark added: “If the condition continues to get worse it could also have a serious effect on her internal organs. However, the only treatment available in the UK at the moment is called spinal fusion. \n\"This operation involves the use of screws, metal rods and a bone graft which would straighten her spine but fuse it all together creating one solid structure. \n\"As Lucy has two curves this means the majority of her spine would need to be fused. This would severely restrict her mobility and have a huge effect on her quality of life. As parents we refused to accept that this was the only option and were convinced there must be something better.\" If Lucy's condition gets worse it could have a serious effect on her internal organs \nAfter extensive research the family found a procedure called Vertebral Body Tethering (VBT) which has been pioneered in the US. \nIn July Lucy had a consultation in London with the only surgeon in the UK who was actively performing this operation. \nMark said: \"Lucy was deemed a candidate and we were absolutely thrilled, feeling like a weight had been lifted off our shoulders. \n“She was scheduled for VBT surgery on 8th December 2016. We even travelled back down to London to undergo all of the pre-operative tests. \n\"Despite being so far through the process, we received a devastating phone call in October to inform us that her surgery had been postponed until December. \n“This was due to issues around funding and NHS England took the action of suspending all VBT for the foreseeable future. This also meant that no surgeon could operate privately in the UK.\" The family have set up a Go Fund Me page in a bid to raise money for Lucy's surgery \nBut if and when VBT is resumed new criteria means Lucy will no longer be a candidate. \n\"This was a huge blow and left us totally and utterly devastated considering her surgery was planned for the following day,\" Mark added. \n“The time following this was extremely tough for the whole family, especially Lucy. \n\"She became very withdrawn and we felt terrible as we had built her hopes up so much.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:12:21.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
