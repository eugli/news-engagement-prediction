As a result, James spoke out , saying, rather pointedly, \"We need a fucking playmaker.\" The insinuation? That the Cavs' management was not providing enough support for LeBron, though they have two other NBA All-Stars in Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, and recently added dangerous outside threat Kyle Korver. Charles Barkley, a former NBA great and now TNT analyst , called those comments inappropriate and then proceeded to whine about LeBron being so whiny. Though James initially dismissed Chuck's comments as meaning absolutely nothing to him, Bron Bron revisited those thoughts after last night's loss to the Dallas Mavericks (bringing the Cavs to 7-8 in January). Here, from ESPN's Dave McMenamin , are a few of James' best quotes clapping back at Barkley, who he called a \"hater\": \n\"I'm not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that. I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas. I never said, 'I'm not a role model.' I never showed up to All-Star Weekend on Sunday because I was in Vegas all weekend partying.\" \n\"Go watch the '93 Finals when John Paxson hit the shot. Barkley and Jordan were laughing and joking with each other during one of the games while somebody's shooting a free throw. In the Finals. But, oh, nobody were friends back then.\" \n\"I'm here to win ballgames and take care of my teammates and take care of my, what's that word, oh, my ' posse .'\" \n\"I know he wanted to retire a long time ago, but he can't. He's stuck up on that stage every week.\" \n\"I collect one paycheck from this. There's the owner, Griff's [David Griffin] the GM, I'm the player. Screw Charles Barkley.\" \nOn the way out of the locker room, he apparently added, \"I'm tired of biting my tongue. There's a new sheriff in town.\" \nTo which we say: FUCK YEAH ! Well, not to the \"new sherriff\" line. (That was corny.) But it hardly diminished what was otherwise a refreshingly honest LeBron James rant. \nAll career long, LeBron James has always maintained the veneer of a player who knows that he is also a brand. He signed to Nike for $90 million while he was still in high school . At the end of 2015, James signed a new deal with Nike, and its staggering price tag, reportedly worth more than one billion dollars , rendered an irrefutable verdict: LeBron James is the among the most valuable faces in sport. And for good reason: LeBron has been the the walking NBA logo for pretty much his entire career. (Sure, let's not forget Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan in his early years, or Steph Curry, James Harden, and Kevin Durant in his most recent ones, but did anybody really question who the best basketball player on the planet—the one true basketball torch-bearer—was during that time? No.) \nAnd so, through it all, LeBron has been polished and packaged, forever cognizant of the image he's projecting. Which has, at times, made him seem manufactured. (Exhibit A: his playoff \"social media exile\". An Instagram is, really, just a way of saying, \"Hey, look at me doing something.\" Not Instagramming says nothing, unless, of course, you go around saying, \"Hey, guys, I'm not Instagramming,\" in which case you're just saying, \"Hey, look at me doing nothing.\") There's a certain level of play that once you hit, you get the privilege of not having to care how you come off, where all lurking insecurity gets washed away in a flood of staggering statistical feats. (MJ didn't give a fuck. Kobe definitely didn't give a fuck. Tim Duncan shops at Old Navy!) On the other hand, LeBron—even as people have called him a traitor, and burned his jersey, and accused him of copping out by only wanting to play with other superstars and friends; even as Phil Jackson disparaged his business associates (who, again, signed a billion dollar deal) as a \"posse\"—has always tried to keep his cool. \nWith these comments, we got a raw, unfiltered LeBron we haven't yet seen. Even his profane comments from a week ago felt measured, like a not-so veiled message to his teammates and his bosses that they need to step up if they want to repeat as NBA Champions. His reaction last night? That was different. There's no subtext to \"Screw Charles Barkley.\" And though fans can feign outrage at athletes when they reveal themselves to be young, competitive dudes, not inoffensive, sports-playing robots—\"What do you mean Steph Curry threw his mouthguard?! The horror!!\"—it's refreshing to see this side of LeBron. Not only is he justified in coming at Barkley for telling him how to win titles—since Barkley has won as many NBA titles as Carly Rae Jepsen—but guess what LeBron probably was when his team was down 3-1 to Golden State in last year's NBA Finals? Angry. \nAnd if Angry LeBron was the LeBron we got over the resulting three-game stretch, one of the greatest stretches of any athlete in any sport, then that's the only LeBron I want to see for however many years we still have left to watch him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:17:23.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
