The mandate had been halted in federal court after a group of 12 states sued the Obama administration last year. \nJohn Eastman, founding director of the Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, said the Trump administration correctly interpreted Title IX, which bars discrimination in education on the basis of “sex,” and protected the privacy rights of all students. \n“It’s not a denial of transgender rights to faithfully apply a statute,” Mr. Eastman said. “We also have a very competing set of rights for privacy. The notion that anatomical boys are going to be in showers in an undressed state with anatomical girls is something that is a really serious challenge to the privacy rights of everybody else in that shower.” \nJames Esseks, director for the American Civil Liberties Union LGBT Project, said schools still have a legal obligation to permit restroom and locker room access on the basis of gender identity. \n“Revoking the guidance shows that the president’s promise to protect LGBT rights was just empty rhetoric,” Ms. Esseks said in a statement. “But the bottom line is that this does not undo legal protections for trans students, and school districts can and must continue to protect them and all students from discrimination.” \nThe ACLU represents a transgender student whose case against a local school board is scheduled to be heard before the Supreme Court next month. \nThe Obama administration had threatened to withhold federal education funding from schools that regulate intimate facilities on the basis of biological sex. \nBut the order was blocked by a federal court in August, and earlier this month Attorney General Jeff Sessions withdrew an appeal filed by the previous administration .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:33:19.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
