Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nQuaking Karen Matthews had a pot of steaming mushy peas dumped over her head by a disgusted mum after she left a chippie. \nMatthews gorges herself on £4.50 fish suppers from her local takeaway three times a week. \nBut she was hit with the gloopy mess just days before the new TV drama The Moorside about her vile crimes was aired. \nAn angry woman followed her out of the chippie and dumped the peas over her head and as the serving slowly dipped down onto her duffel coat she ranted: “You evil b****. I’m a mother too.” \n“Karen thinks this is just the start and wonders now how many more attacks she’ll suffer,” says a source close to her.

She was living quite a peaceful life until this programme came along. \n\"But Karen being Karen, she doesn’t think it is anything to do with what she did by kidnapping her daughter.” \nMatthews, 41, is living in fear after the hit new BBC show, where she’s played by Game of Thrones star Gemma Whelan.
