Regardless, the birth is another coup for the zoo, as officials there have been successful in breeding the Francois’ langur monkey, which is endangered in the wild. \nThe baby, born Monday, and can be seen at the Helen Brach Primate House, the zoo announced Thursday. The infant is the seventh successful offspring for Pumpkin, the mother; and Cartman, the father, according to the zoo. It joins sisters Kieu and Orla, brothers Vinh and Pierre, and adult female Chi in the troop. \nThe baby won’t stand out for long. Its fur will turn from orange to black by the time it is six months old. \n“Pumpkin is an experienced and attentive mother and the entire troop is being supportive,” the zoo’s curator of primates, Maureen Leahy, said in a statement. \nFrancois’ langurs — native to China, Vietnam and Laos — are endangered in the wild due to habitat degradation and hunting. \nThe baby can be seen between 10 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. daily at the zoo.
