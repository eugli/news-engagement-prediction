The building is so old we can't even upgrade wiring,\" Daniell told CTV Vancouver.\nRight now the BC SPCA is exploring two options: redeveloping its East Vancouver site, which would involve a temporary relocation, or else sell the land the current shelter sits on and look for another site in the city.\nConstruction on the new Vancouver shelter alone could run $20-21-million, Daniell said.\nThe animal welfare agency wants the new shelter to act as a community hub will serve as a destination for people looking for more information about animal adoption, and people wanting to learn more about animal welfare.\nThe $5-million announced Tuesday by the province is on top of the $5-million it contributed in 2015 as part of the BC SPCA's eight-year capital development project, which will also see a new community animal shelter constructed in Prince George.\nThe overall plan, which it put in front of the B.C. government four years ago, involves nearly $54-million in capital projects to create state-of-the-art shelters across the province.\nThe first phase of funding saw a specialized facility for seized cats in Surrey, large animal adoption barns in Surrey and Kelowna, and a new animal centre in Nanaimo.\n\"It's an enormous undertaking,\" said Daniell.\nRelated Stories 'First shelter of its kind': Community animal centre opens in Nanaimo", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:40:42.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
