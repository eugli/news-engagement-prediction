Photo: Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images In 1999, Kevin Hassett co-authored a book that offered its readers the following advice:\n[T]he single most important fact about stocks at the dawn of the twenty-first century: They are cheap … If you are worried about missing the market’s big move upward, you will discover that it is not too late. Stocks are now in the midst of a one-time-only rise to much higher ground — to the neighborhood of 36,000 on the Dow Jones industrial average. Five months after Hassett’s book was published, the “dot com bubble” burst.\nIn 2004, the New York Times asked Hassett what he made of the claim that a bubble was growing in the U.S. housing market. Hassett replied that liberals were prone to see false bubbles, because of their ideological commitment to government intervention. He then conceded that there might be “bubble dynamics” in some regions, but that the housing market was healthy, on the whole.\n“’I don’t think a catastrophe is very likely,” Hassett told the paper.\nOn Friday, Politico reported that president Trump plans to name Hassett as the chairman of his White House Council of Economic Advisers.\nIf nominated and confirmed, Hassett would lead the office tasked with projecting the future economic implications of the Trump administration’s tax and budget plans.\nTrump has evinced little interest in the advice of academic economists. It is unusual for a president to complete his first month in the Oval Office without nominating a single economist to the CEA. And his administration has already announced that, unlike during Obama’s tenure, the CEA chair will not be a cabinet-level position.\nThe administration did, however, ( reportedly ) instruct the existing CEA staff to assume that economic growth will hover around 3 percent over the next decade when calculating the impact of tax cuts on the deficit. The CBO and Federal Reserve project annual economic growth to hover around 1.9 and 1.8 percent, respectively, for most of the coming decade.\nHassett is a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, where he has produced research showing that tax cuts for the rich are actually progressive , and that income inequality has not grown significantly in recent decades .\nTags: trump administration council of economic advisers president trump american enterprise institute bubbles Trump to Pick Man Known For Bad Advice as Economic Adviser Trump’s Rollback on Transgender Bathroom Rule Is Just the Beginning Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party Trump’s Health-Care Nightmare Is Only Just Beginning Most Viewed Stories This Obscure News Story, Which Should Be Huge, Shows How Trump Gets Away With Corruption Customs Agents Check Passengers’ IDs on Domestic Flight at JFK Trump Condemns FBI Leakers for Leaking That He Asked Them to Leak Connie Britton Leaves Nashville Fans With the Cold Comfort of a Heartfelt Coda After That Momentous Episode Trump’s Health-Care Nightmare Is Only Just Beginning Vulture’s Final 2017 Oscar Predictions for Every Category Video Games Are Better Than Real Life 15 Stars Reminisce About the Actors Who Used to Beat Them Out for Roles Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party Trump’s Counterterrorism Adviser Sebastian Gorka Has Links to Anti-Semitic Groups Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer The Wildest Moments From Donald Trump’s Press Conference Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 6:19 p.m. New York City Recorded Its Lowest Number of Traffic Fatalities in 2016 A small dip from 2015, but the third-straight yearly decline under Vision Zero.\n6:13 p.m. Democrats Make a Risky Pick for Response to Trump’s Big Speech to Congress Former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear is an out-of-work centrist representing a party that’s energized on the left.\n6:04 p.m. Leaked House Obamacare Repeal Draft Shows Dangerous Work in Progress A leaked document shows House Republicans mulling controversial ideas like ending Medicaid as we know it and a new tax on employer-provided insurance.\n5:42 p.m. Leaked DHS Report Undermines Trump’s Argument for His Travel Ban It says citizenship in the Muslim-majority countries included in the ban is an “unlikely indicator” of a terrorism threat.\n4:50 p.m. GOP Tax Cut Waiting for Trump to Decide on Policy He Clearly Doesn’t Understand Don’t feel bad for Paul Ryan, he’ll end up getting a big tax cut for the rich in the end.\n4:31 p.m. A Bunch of Cities Are Sweating Through the Hottest February Day on Record It’s been a hot month, with nearly 4,500 record highs set, compared to 29 record lows.\n3:51 p.m. Kansas Suspect Allegedly Said ‘Get Out of My Country,’ Then Shot 2 Indian Men The White House denied any links to President Trump’s rhetoric.\n3:39 p.m. White House Bars New York Times , CNN, and Politico From Press Briefing Earlier in the day, Trump explained that the media isn’t the “enemy of the people” — but the fake news media is .\n2:40 p.m. Trump Expected to Pick Man Known For Bad Economic Advice As Top Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett once co-authored a book imploring investors to enter the stock market — just before the dot-com bubble burst.\n2:37 p.m. Trump Offers Conservatives the World — in Exchange for Their Principles Is the mainstream right ready to replace its traditional values with pure nationalism?\n1:04 p.m. Trump’s Rollback on Transgender Bathroom Rule Is Just the Beginning It looked like Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s warm-up act in loosening protections for all minorities.\n12:57 p.m. Trump Praises First Amendment, Calls for Media Suppression and Fewer Protests The president told CPAC the media “shouldn’t be allowed” to cite anonymous sources, and suggested people shouldn’t protest after an election.\n12:23 p.m. Trump Can’t Stop Undermining His Claim to Represent the Workers Party “We will not answer to donors, lobbyists, or special interests … now here’s another story about me answering to special interests.”\n11:56 a.m. Trump’s Security Adviser Sebastian Gorka Has Links to Anti-Semitic Groups This may be the lowlight of a week that also saw him make an unhinged phone call to a critic that got recorded and published.\n11:51 a.m. Trump: U.S. Has ‘Fallen Behind’ on Nukes, Vows to Return to ‘Top of the Pack’ This isn’t the first time the president has appeared to advocate for nuclear proliferation.\n9:44 a.m. Trump Condemns FBI Leakers for Leaking That He Asked Them to Leak The White House asked the FBI to leak exculpating details about Trump’s ties with Russia.
