Nobody knows this better than J.W.Anderson, a designer with his finger on the pulse of young London—and, in recent runway seasons, a champion of fresh new beauty statements made to suit his cool girl clientele. Today’s show was no exception. While many of Anderson’s models embraced their natural hair texture—shagged crops, pyramidal waves, mini-afros—models with longer lengths walked the runway with a sporty new street style staple. Hair was fastened parted deeply to one side, then fastened low and left to swing over the opposite shoulder. Upping the personality factor of Anderson’s polished pullbacks: an exposed ear adorned in a gilded floral cuff. More subversively chic than the pretty beribboned ponytails seen in New York last week , Anderson’s take arrives as a quirky and elegant British cousin. Come fall, his fans will snap up multiples of those ear cuffs at stores like Liberty of London—but the swagger required to pull them off? Can’t be bought.
