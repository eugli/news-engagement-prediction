It was claimed that 30 police officers and three police horses were injured during the day, with one man being taken to hospital with knife wounds. \nSome of the violent scenes can be witnessed on YouTube, with one comment reading: “Ever since that day every cup draw been wanting Tottenham away.” Spurs and Millwall last met at Keith Stevens' testimonial in 2001, a match marred by violence before and after the game Credit: Action Images \nT he FA is well aware of the history between the clubs and will be involved in talks over the kick-off time with the Metropolitan Police, Tottenham, Millwall and, if the tie is picked for television, broadcasters. \nFA Cup rules allow for an away allocation of up to 15 per cent of the home stadium, although that number is subject to approval from the local Safety Advisory Group, which is made up of the police, council, fire brigade and club. \nBecause of the work on the new stadium, the capacity of White Hart Lane has been reduced to 31,500 this season, which could also have an impact on the number of tickets allocated to Millwall. \nThe tie is likely to be the last-ever FA Cup game at White Hart Lane, as the semi-finals and final are staged at Wembley and Spurs are due to move into the national stadium for all games next season while their new home is finished. \nM eanwhile, the fallout from unruly scenes at the Den after the defeat of Leicester continued with the Premier League champions saying they received “numerous complaints” and “will not accept the safety of our supporters, players, and staff being compromised”. \nA Leicester spokesman added: “Following receipt of numerous complaints relating to the constant abuse, provocation and intimidation of our players, staff and supporters from our arrival at the stadium, throughout the match and in its immediate aftermath, we have registered our dissatisfaction with the FA. ” \nA Millwall spokesman said: “We have been made aware of these allegations today and are extremely disappointed that Leicester City, as is the professional protocol in such instances, did not raise them on the day of the game itself.” The FA said it would contact Leicester to discuss the issues. \nThe quarter-final will put Tottenham star Harry Kane up against the club he spent six months on loan with, which was enough time for the striker to be named Millwall’s young player of the season after scoring nine goals. \nKane believes Spurs will have an advantage in this season’s FA Cup if they get past Gent in the Europa League at Wembley on Thursday night and knock out Millwall to reach the last four.

We go again on Thursday and if we can get a good feeling there, get used to it, play our style of football, then the more games we play there the better it will be for us, the more used to the surroundings we’ll be. We’ve got to try to make Wembley our home.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:00:46.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
