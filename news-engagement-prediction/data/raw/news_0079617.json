By: FE Online | Published:  11 PM With Surge 1 SoC in Xiaomi Mi 5c, it is now only the fourth company to have its own processor. \nXiaomi , in a bid to follow Samsung, Apple and Huawei, has launched its own in-house processor Surge S1 along with the Xiaomi Mi 5c smartphone. Xiaomi Mi 5c smartphone comes after many rumours and speculations and is a special device because of the processor. The smartphone is a less powerful version of the previous smartphone by the company, Xiaomi Mi 5. Xiaomi is now only the fourth company to have its own processor. This essentially means that Xiaomi’s devices will get cheaper as it will not be dependent on other countries to get its processors. The Xiaomi Mi 5c will come at a price of 1,500 Yuan (around Rs 15,000), while the Xiaomi Mi 5 costs around 2,700 Yuan. The phone will be launched in China on March 3. \nIn terms of specifications, the Xiaomi Mi 5c has a 5.15-inch display screen with 2,560 x 1,600 resolution. The smartphone has a 12-megapixel camera at the back and 8-megapixel front shooter. The phone has a metal unibody design. The device features a 3GB RAM along with 64GB of internal memory. The phone is fueled by a 2,860 mAh non-removable battery. Xiaomi Mi 5c runs the latest Android 7.1 Nougat OS alongside the company’s own MIUI on top. The device comes in three colour variants, Black, Rose Gold and Gold. The new octa-core Surge S1 SoC is built on the 28nm process and runs up to 2.2GHz. It is a 64-bit octa-core SoC with ARM Cortex-A53 cores. However, four power-efficient ARM Cortex-A53 cores are clocked at 1.4GHz. \nXiaomi’s Surge 1 processor also has a chip level security feature which protects data and unauthorised network access. This move by Xiaomi to manufacture its own processor will give it an edge over other rivals, especially in its own country China, where it has been performing poorly. However, as of now, the Xiaomi Mi 5c is available exclusively in China. \nAs far as its release in India is concerned, there is no information out yet. When the company’s Mi 5 was launched in China in February 2016, it came to India after a month making it the first country out of China to see the phone. However, the Mi 5s which launched in China at a price of 1,999 Yuan did not see the light of day in India. Even Xiaomi’s Redmi Pro or the Mi Note 2 might not find their way to India.
