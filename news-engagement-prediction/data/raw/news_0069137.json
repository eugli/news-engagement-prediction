Even though Beyoncé put on an awe-inspiring performance just weeks ago at the Grammys, her doctors are recommending she take on less activity in the near future. The announcement confirmed weeks of speculation that her pregnancy (with twins) would force her to back out.\n\"Following the advice of her doctors to keep a less rigorous schedule in the coming months, Beyonce has made the decision to forgo performing at the 2017 Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival,” the Associated Press reports .\nThere is some good news, though: Beyoncé’s reps confirmed that the singer would instead headline next year’s festival.\nCoachella has not yet announced who will take Beyoncé’s place on April 15 and 22. Radiohead and Kendrick Lamar are still scheduled to appear as the festival’s other main acts. Other performers include the xx, Gucci Mane, Bon Iver, Father John Misty, Lorde, and Future.\nThe singer would have been the first female performer in 10 years—and the first woman of color—to headline the festival. (Bjork headlined there in 2007.) The singer spectacularly announced her pregnancy in early February on Instagram, causing fans to question whether she would actually perform at Coachella—though initially, at least, it seemed that she would not let her coming twins stop her from taking the Coachella stage . Here&apos;s to seeing the whole gang, twins, Jay Z, Blue Ivy and even Solange, on stage in 2018—donning flower crowns, of course.\nRELATED: A New Beyoncé Song Is Here, and It&apos;s a Banger", "external_links": ["http://www.pe.com/articles/associated-826127-pregnant-beyonce.html", "http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/02/beyonce-still-planning-on-coachella"], "published": "2017-02-24T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:56:54.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
