It is also believed to be rich in oil and gas deposits. \nChina has built three airstrips and had been converting the manmade islands into garrisons, setting up anti-air missiles and air defence radars, against which Manila protested in December. \nManila would file another protest if it could confirm China was completing missile sites on its manmade islands, Yasay added. - Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:26:11.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
