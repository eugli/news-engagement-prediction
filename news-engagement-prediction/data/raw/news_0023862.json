His comment caused cops to believe race was a factor in Vetrano’s slaying, sources said. \nA white detective initially tried twice to get Lewis to talk and he refused, according to sources. \nBut when the black detective, Barry Brown, interviewed him, Lewis waived his Miranda rights and gave two videotaped statements, confessing he’d “hit” and “choked” the jogger on Aug. 2. \nBrown is known as a highly skilled officer and the “best detective in Queens for getting confessions,” sources said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T13:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:22:37.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
