Lisa trusted you. Think back to that night, I'm sure it's not hard to do, it mustn't ever be far from your thoughts.\n– Lisa’s sister Joanne “Think about what happened when Lisa died, how you panicked and made a decision that would change your life and our lives forever. Then think of Lisa.\n“Remember how she loved to laugh and have a good time. How she spoke of her dreams and plans for the future.\n\"The future she would never have after that night.”\nLisa was 25 when she died and went missing, she would now be 37. Credit: PSNI Police said the investigation into Lisa’s disappearance and murder over the past 12 years has been “substantial”.\nIt has involved the identification of more than 4,000 witnesses, taking statements from 571 people, 275 searches -194 of them in caravans and outbuildings and eight arrests on suspicion of murder, and a number of others for unrelated drugs offences.\nMy daughter Lisa deserves to be found and laid to rest with her mum. We all think of Lisa every day. I'm sure you do too. Just tell us where she is. It's never too late to tell us. A place is all we need.\n– Lisa’s father John The officer leading the investigation, Detective Chief Inspector Justyn Galloway, said: “For 12 years, Lisa’s family and friends have suffered intolerable grief.\n“They cannot even begin to move on with their lives until her body is found. Sadly Lisa’s mother passed away last year without getting the answers she so badly wanted but the nightmare still goes on for Lisa’s father and three sisters.\n“They continue to feel the pain and suffering of not knowing what happened to their loved one.”\nAnyone with information that could help the PSNI’s investigations has been asked to get in touch with detectives by calling the number 101.\nLast updated Tue 28 Feb 2017 police Northern Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:52:28.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
