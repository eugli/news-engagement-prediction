Khan, who hailed from the northeastern Bangladesh district of Sylhet, was a real estate broker. He is survived by wife, a daughter and two sons.\nThose close to him told bdnews24.com that he had been a tenant of the Egyptian landlord for a long time. \nThe landlord, however, alleges that Khan was not paying the rent for several months as he wanted to buy the apartment, they said. \nBangladeshis thronged the hospital as soon as the news of Khan's murder broke. \nKhan, a popular face among the community, actively participated in community events. \nHe was one of the key organisers of the event in Bronx two days ago to observe the International Mother Language Day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:03:01.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
