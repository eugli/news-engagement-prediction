By Willa Frej \nA Department of Homeland Security memorandum released Tuesday reveals that President Donald Trump has declared an open season on the deportation of undocumented immigrants. \n“The Department will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,” the memo said. \nDHS directed Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hire 10,000 additional people to get the job done, according to the memo. \nThe memo does indicate that the priority remains “removable aliens” who have been convicted of a crime or charged with a crime. \nIt does not, to the chagrin of many conservatives, indicate any changes to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. \nTrump consistently promised previously to crack down on undocumented immigrants both throughout his campaign and since he assumed office. \nRights groups reported an uptick in Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests last week. However, an ICE official appearing to contradict that statement during a press call, saying that the activity was “routine” and agencies only targeted certain cities in an “enforcement surge.” \nActivists told The Huffington Post last week that the crackdown in Austin, Texas consisted of ICE agents stopping undocumented immigrants in traffic, attempting to arrest them in their homes and patrolling the area around a grocery store. \nThe Obama administration made a point of prioritizing those with criminal histories for deportation. This memo indicates a radical departure from that norm, opening up the basis for removal from the U.S. to pretty much anyone. \nUp until last week, Trump also to tackle criminals as a priority. The crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise. Gang members, drug dealers & others are being removed! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017 \nRead the full memo below: \n\nThis is a developing story. Please check back for details.
