He praised Kara-Murza as being a champion for human rights and for the Russian people. \nHe spoke at length about Kara-Murza’s remarkable life and the risks he took in returning to Russia to keep fighting for what he believed in (considering what has happened to other critics of Putin’s). And at one point, McCain said this: \n“Vladimir knew that Putin is a killer… and that he might very well be the next target. Vladimir knew there was no moral equivalence between the United States and Putin’s Russia. I repeat, there is no moral equivalence between that butcher and thug and KGB colonel and the United States of America, the country that Ronald Reagan used to call a shining city on a hill. And to allege some kind of moral equivalence between the two is either terribly misinformed or incredibly biased.” \nHe did not mention anyone by name, but McCain was very clearly reacting to President Trump’s comments about Russia and the U.S. in his interview with Bill O’Reilly . \nWatch above, via C-SPAN 2. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:46:35.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
