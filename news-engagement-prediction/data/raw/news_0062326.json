Elwell, who had a blood alcohol content of 0.175 at the time, more than twice the legal limit, was speeding when his BMW crashed into Javadi’s Lexus, sending her into a metal pole. She died about an hour later, the Dallas Morning News reports . \nHIGH SCHOOL STUDENT ARRESTED WITH MACHETE ON CAMPUS \nAs part of a plea deal arranged by Javadi’s parents and prosecutors, Elwell will also serve one week in jail on the anniversary of Javadi’s death on Feb. 10, 2015, for the next nine years, WFAA reports . \n“That was the only thing that was important to us,” Javadi’s father, Michael, told the station Thursday. “That there needs to be some sort of accountability for the irresponsible actions that he took.” \nThe Javadis said they were never interested in seeing Elwell locked up for life, but rather acting on advice given to them by their attorneys that drunk drivers convicted of intoxication manslaughter often receive probation instead of years behind bars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:57:03.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
