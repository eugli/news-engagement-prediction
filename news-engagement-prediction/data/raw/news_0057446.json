Before he said anything I said: “Think carefully before you say anything.” Wenger was forced to watch four games from the stands (Getty) \n‘He responded by saying “you are dishonest to your federation.” I considered this to be questioning both mine and the referee, Jon Moss’s integrity and impartiality. I stated to Mr. Wenger that such a comment was not acceptable and he told me to “f*** off” on two separate occasions.’ Arsenal fixtures \nLiverpool (A) – Sat 4 Mar Bayern Munich – Champions League (H) – Tue 7 Mar Lincoln – FA Cup (H) – 11/12 Mar West Brom (A) – Sat 18 Mar Manchester City (H) – Sat 1 Apr West Ham (H) – Tue 4 Apr Crystal Palace (A) – Sat 8 Apr ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:11:40.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
