So were the measurements made in neighbouring countries, like Finland. \n“The levels raise no concern for humans or the environment.” \nGETTY SUB: A Russian nuclear submarine could be the source How destructive is a nuclear weapon? The TERRIFYING images of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Thursday, 9th February 2017 There is a reason people fear nuclear war – the weapons are now so powerful they could wipe out humanity. The bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima are tiny by comparison to the destructive power of modern nuclear weapons – which are thought to be over 3000 times more powerful. 1 / 12 The mushroom cloud over Nagasaki, viewed from the ground. \nThe particles may have been released by a nuclear reactor or a medical facility. \nAnother possibility is the emissions from Russian nuclear submarines.
