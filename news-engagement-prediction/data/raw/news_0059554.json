Keep smiling! Mourinho of all people melts hearts with touching message to Ranieri \nThe England international has been strongly linked with a shock move to China before their transfer window closes next Tuesday, but Neville thinks it would be unwise by the Red Devils. \nUnited are still competing in four competitions this season as they aim for a top four finish in the Premier League whilst also looking to win the EFL Cup, Europa League and FA Cup. Rooney recently became United’s all-time leading goalscorer (Picture: Getty) \nHaving already sold Memphis Depay and Morgan Schneiderlin in January, Neville feels United losing Rooney now would put them at real risk of a majorly depleted squad if they were to pick up any injuries between now and May. \n‘I would like to think Rooney would stay at Manchester United,’ Neville told Sky Sports. \n‘It is strange timing – the (English) transfer window is over and yet there is this debate when there is still two months of the season to go. That seems odd. There is still a contribution to be made and many trophies to be played for and won at United.
