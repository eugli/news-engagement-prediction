Trump said the next day people should look at what happened “last night in Sweden.” People were confused what he was talking about, and the president had to clarify he was referring to the Fox segment. \nTonight Carlson brought back that filmmaker, Ami Horowitz , to respond to the officers he interviewed saying that they were unfairly edited . Horowitz insisted he did no such thing and said he himself had his words distorted by Politifact. \nCarlson also talked to a journalist working for a Swedish publication and a former U.S. ambassador to Sweden, and they both got into it with Carlson over stats showing a rise in crime. \nCarlson was particularly perturbed about what he sees as a cultural climate in Sweden where questioning whether refugees are connected to a rise in crime is practically a “thought crime” that could get you in trouble. \nWatch the full segment above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:53:59.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
