More A spokesman for the star has insisted that the emails were “doctored” by hackers, with sources now saying that Beckham understandably “regrets” sending the messages to his PR, Simon Oliveira, in “the heat of the moment”.\nSpeaking to The Mirror, a close friend of David’s said of the leak: “[David] is very calm at the moment because he knows the great work that he has done for UNICEF. But he is just saddened that people would question all of that work.\n“Genuinely, he wasn’t as vitriolic as that, but you do say some things in private and in the heat of the moment.\n“To be honest, he does feel that he has given so much to his country. And sometimes you say things in private that anyone would say and you don’t really mean it.\nView photos\nDavid has been a UNICEF ambassador for many years. More “While he was frustrated in those emails, he was over it the moment he sent them.\n“Getting the knighthood is not what his work is about. He doesn’t care if he gets a knighthood or not.”\nBeckham’s work as UNICEF’s ambassador has come under scrutiny since the emails leaked, with some messages appearing to show the star demanding that the charity paid £6,685 for a business class flight to visit children affected by a Typhoon in the Philippines.\nAnother exchange shows Oliveira suggesting that David put a million dollars into a UNICEF prize-giving dinner, only for Beckham to reply: “I don’t want to put my personal money into this cause. To pour this million into the fund, is like putting my own money in.\nView photos\nThe star’s emails have been defended by UNICEF. More “If there was no fund, the money would be for me. This f***ing money is mine.”\nHowever, the source insists that David’s charity work is genuine, adding: “The one thing David is very proud of and feels can’t be faulted is his work for UNICEF. He has not only donated his own money, he has raised millions to help vulnerable children around the world.\n“More importantly he has worked with the charity over the last 15 years. The fact that there are these hackers who are selectively in some instances cheekily doctoring some of that information saddens him.\n“He will be going about his daily life with his kids. He has got work commitments coming up and he has constant work with UNICEF.\nView photos\nDavid with his four children. More Read More “There is always work he is doing with the charity, whether that is dinners or field trips. There are always a lot of things planned. Nothing will deter him or stop him from continuing with UNICEF. He is incredibly proud of what he is doing.\n“The sad thing is he is being vilified when he has done such great work.\n“It’s the first time an ambassador in UN history has his own fund. Why these people want to detract from such great work is unbelievable.”\nUNICEF themselves issues a statement about the leaked emails yesterday, seemingly defending the father-of-four.\nView photos\nNeither David or Victoria have publicly commented on the leaked emails. More They shared: “UNICEF has become aware of media reports relating to 7: The David Beckham Unicef Fund.\n“Some reports relate to alleged private correspondence between our ambassador and other parties, which we have not seen and cannot comment upon.\n“David Beckham has been a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since 2005. As well as generously giving his time, energy and support to help raise awareness and funds for UNICEF’s work for children, David has given ­significant funds personally.”\nWhen the story first broke, a spokesman for Beckham said that the leaks were “outdated material taken out of context from hacked and doctored private emails from a third party server giving a deliberately inaccurate picture”.\nView photos\nDavid hopes to continue as normal amid the scandal. More They went on to add: “David Beckham and UNICEF have had a powerful partnership in support of children for over 15 years. The David Beckham 7 Fund specifically has raised millions of pounds and helped millions of vulnerable ­children around the world.\n“David has given significant time and energy and has made personal financial donations to the 7 Fund and this commitment will continue.\n“He and UNICEF are rightly proud of what they have and will continue to achieve together and are happy to let the facts speak for themselves.”\nNeither David or his wife, Victoria, have publicly commented on the scandal.", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NzpbrIoh215lQTn3WfCUtA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NDg3/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/a3b60f4686fac6f2747194b1274d78df);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Pe2H3qyDA8qhcOPOCHsa.A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9OTQ1/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/db85c609d88ba0eacd6bcd5d40ed7fd7", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/s5_YEttzdufCGNd7J1Xcbg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NDg2/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/635d517c0da34c3441843cb83a874463);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kYidp5xjClE_tgPYZdqfNg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTA3/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/4901cdaaed63531f343bb22d508caa65);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pWZjalALWral1gTCg5fTCg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9OTI5/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/11e09f6885d9baeb7e391a823d7a5a96);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.HJqwknD_w_S7h1.XDWcEQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjMwO2g9NDI5/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0f8959eb416b2ebf7af2fdd4b008ca9d", "https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150604/orb.png);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.HJqwknD_w_S7h1.XDWcEQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjMwO2g9NDI5/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0f8959eb416b2ebf7af2fdd4b008ca9d);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Pe2H3qyDA8qhcOPOCHsa.A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9OTQ1/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/db85c609d88ba0eacd6bcd5d40ed7fd7);", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/s5_YEttzdufCGNd7J1Xcbg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NDg2/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/635d517c0da34c3441843cb83a874463", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NzpbrIoh215lQTn3WfCUtA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NDg3/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/a3b60f4686fac6f2747194b1274d78df", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kYidp5xjClE_tgPYZdqfNg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTA3/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/4901cdaaed63531f343bb22d508caa65", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pWZjalALWral1gTCg5fTCg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9OTI5/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/11e09f6885d9baeb7e391a823d7a5a96"], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T10:24:05.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
