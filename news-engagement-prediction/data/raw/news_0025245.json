It was reported that fast bowler Mohammed Shami, who has not played for India since the third Test against England in November on account of a recurrence of a knee injury, might be selected but he remains sidelined. \n\nAnd with Rohit Sharma also sidelined as he recovers from the right thigh injury sustained in October during the New Zealand ODI series, Karun Nair holds his place. Abhinav Mukund has been retained as the reserve opener. \n\nThe uncapped left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav is the fourth spinner behind R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja , currently the top two names in the ICC's Test bowlers rankings, and offspinner Jayant Yadav. Amit Mishra, who was ruled out of the Bangladesh Test with injury, was not selected. \n\nThis year's Border Gavaskar Trophy pits the two top sides against each other - India are No 1 in the ICC Test Championship with 121 ratings points, followed by Australia at second with 109 - with Australia holders of the trophy following their 2-0 win at home in 2013-14. India are on a roll in Tests, having not lost a match since August 2015 in Sri Lanka. Since then, Virat Kohli 's team has gone 19 Tests without a defeat, a record for India and the fifth-best streak in the game's history. The Bangladesh win was India's sixth series in a row, their best streak in Tests, surpassing the previous record of five series wins in 2008-10 under MS Dhoni. \n\n\nAustralia have not won a Test in Asia since August 2011, when they won the first of three Tests in Sri Lanka. Since then, they have drawn two and lost nine in a row. This woeful run includes a 4-0 win by India in 2013, 2-0 by Pakistan in the UAE in 2014 and a landmark 3-0 sweep by Sri Lanka last year. \n\nThe four Tests matches will be played in Pune (February 23-27), Bangalore (March 4-8), Ranchi (March 16-20) and Dharamsala (March 25-29). A two-day practice game between Australia and India A will be held at Mumbai's Brabourne Stadium from February 16. \n\nSquad: Virat Kohli (capt), Murali Vijay, KL Rahul, Abhinav Mukund, Cheteshwar Pujara , Ajinkya Rahane , Karun Nair, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Hardik Pandya, R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Jayant Yadav, Kuldeep Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:21:00.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
