But I care for my kids too, and I just think that this is not appropriate,\" said Blain, who won't be sending his son to Royal Vale.\n\"Knowing that this practice is an ongoing thing, I think that I'd be ashamed to be part of that board and let that happen every year.

The school is in demand,\" said Lalla, adding Royal Vale offers things such as hockey and music programs.\nRoyal Vale is also a French immersion school, which is attractive to many parents, he said.\nLalla said the school has tried to come up with other registration systems, but they've determined the line is the fairest option.\n\"No doubt, people have other suggestions, but this seems to be the best one the school can come up with,\" he said.\nParent questions why schools kept open after EMSB bus slides off icy street EMSB urges province to delay approval of controversial Quebec history course With files from CBC Montreal's Daybreak", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:13:15.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
