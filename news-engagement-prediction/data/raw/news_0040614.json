Officials warned the prevalence of fake documents posed a 'serious threat to the security of the EU' and highlighted the continued risk posed by IS fighters returning to Europe. The report also drew attention to the Berlin Christmas market terror attack last year which was carried out by a failed asylum seeker found in possession of several fake documents. The scale of the problem was further shown by the detection of 7,000 migrants carrying fake documents, predominantly at airports, before reaching the EU. Smuggling networks operating in the northern African country are said to be making millions of pounds every week and are responsible for 96 per cent of all attempted crossings The report, carried out by the EU's Frontex agency, warned that criminals are increasingly transporting vulnerable migrants to Europe as sex workers and as slave labour. It said there were around half a million detected illegal border crossings in 2016, compared to 1.8 million in 2015. Officials said gangs are increasingly using more 'flexible and sophisticated' tactics to avoid being detected. The report said: 'With the difficulties associated with proper screening and registration of a large number of arrivals, there is a risk that persons posing a security threat may be entering the EU.' In a sign that gangs are using people smuggling as a vehicle for other crimes, it was also revealed that teams seized 96 tonnes of drugs while trying to prevent migrants entering Europe last year. The profit-driven approach adopted by smugglers has also led to a surge in the number of migrants dying en route to Europe, the report said. It said that a record number of 4,579 deaths were recorded on the perilous Mediterranean route between Libya and Italy last year. As well as helping migrants to reach the EU, the report said that a burgeoning black market had developed to help illegal immigrants achieve citizenship once they had gained entry There were 228 recorded deaths in January alone, by far the biggest total for the month in recent years. The central Mediterranean route saw 2,869 deaths in 2015 and 3,161 in 2014. Smuggling networks operating in the northern African country are said to be making millions of pounds every week and are responsible for 96 per cent of all attempted crossings. After other popular migration routes, such as via Greece or the West Balkans, were largely closed down last year, officials fear that Libya will become the epicentre of a new crisis. Frontex executive director Fabrice Leggeri said the increase in rescue ships being sent was prompting smugglers to cram more people onto tiny dinghies. He said that smugglers often send vessels out to sea with the intention of being detected by rescue boats, so migrants are given a safer passage. But the report said that the criminals are becoming more bold and reckless, knowing that rescue boats will be right on the edge of Libya's territorial waters. More than half a million people have entered Italy from Libya since 2014.
