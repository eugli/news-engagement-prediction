Deloitte & Touche LLP has named Tamika Tremaglio to lead its massive Greater Washington practice, the largest accounting, consulting and audit operation in the region. Tremaglio, previously a principal in Delloite Financial Advisory Services LLP, is replacing the outgoing Gary Tabach , who has held the position for about 12 years. You might remember Tabach made the Washington Business Hall of Fame in 2016 . Enlarge Tamika Tremaglio is the new managing principal for Deloitte's Greater Washington practice. Tremaglio is deeply familiar with the region, having been born in Leonardtown in St. Mary’s County in Maryland and then getting her bachelor's in business administration from Mount Saint Mary’s University before earning her law degree at the University of Maryland School of Law and an MBA from the University of Baltimore. She has been with Deloitte locally since 2010. Before that she was at Huron Consulting and KPMG. At Deloitte, she'll oversee 7,766 tax professionals, according to Washington Business Journal research, more than twice as many as PricewaterhouseCoopers with 3,286 and Ernst & Young with 2,065. Deloitte, which reported $35.2 billion in companywide revenue in 2015, is the 17th largest employer in the region, with 8,778 total metro-area employees. Tremaglio, an African-American woman, told me her elevation not only shows Deloitte’s commitment to diversity but also gives her a chance to encourage diversity within the local practice and make sure the firm is promoting an inclusive environment. “I will continue to be in a position where I am able to bring people up and bring people along,” Tramaglio said. “It really is what we stand for.” Two of the local chiefs of the Big Four accounting firms are now women; Tremaglio joins Terri McClements , the market managing partner at PwC since July 2014. Candy Duncan was the office managing partner for the Washington metro area at KPMG from 2009 to 2013. Tremaglio, who is on the board of the Calverton School and the board of visitors at the University of Maryland School of Law, serves as the president of the Women’s National Basketball Players Association Foundation. She previously served as the vice chair and audit committee chair of the National Aquarium in Baltimore. Andy Medici covers money, the economy, demographics, housing and financial services.
