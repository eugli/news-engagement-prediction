None of us are that well-equipped for such circumstances, but making my potential new boss cry wasn’t ideal.\nIt had been eight months since his death when I was recording a pilot programme at what was to become TalkRADIO . I had looked up from the mic through the glass at the station editor to see tears in his eyes. Suddenly I was right back in the moment. It all came flooding back – the phone call;the dreadful certainty of the voice on the other end telling me that death was imminent; the 200-mile journey made in a haze of shock and nausea, not knowing whether I’d get to see my dad before “it” happened. As I relived the horror in a tiny studio cubicle, my emotions about dad’s death made a very sudden and public reappearance in front of two strangers.\nI spent over a decade working in the City, where 'death' was a word never uttered, let alone 'grief'\n\nIf you’d asked before I started my own grief-filled journey, I would have said that we’re all rubbish at talking about death. I didn’t realise that we’re even worse about talking about grief. Much of it is of course down to any lack of prior personal experience. I spent over a decade working in the City, where “death” was a word never uttered, let alone “grief”. If anyone had been bereaved, they would quickly return to work, often with colleagues having no idea that anything had happened. The subject was tiptoed around, an inconvenience to the real work of spreadsheets, meetings and deadlines.\nIn keeping our stiff upper lip, we favour the stumble and mumble method of reaching for “I’m so sorry”, “Are you OK?” or “You’re being very strong”. Once one of the standard platitudes has been employed, you’ll find your colleague moonwalking rapidly to the office kitchen. Stoicism and a return to routine is good for some; there isn’t a “right” way to grieve – but the corporate average of three to five days’ compassionate leave seems meagre. I’m not sure you’re anywhere near ready to be useful 72 hours after losing a member of your immediate family.\n'I didn't realise he was dying' - losing my fiancé, and then his family Read more \nFacebook employees can now take up to 20 days off with pay to mourn the death of an immediate family member. That might be expensive, but surely it’s better to have someone return to work in something approaching a fit state. To give them time to sort out funerals, family arrangements and care for others left behind, the result has to be not only a more productive employee but a more loyal one.\nHaving been freelance for years, I didn’t have to worry too much about it when I lost my dad. I took two weeks off before I returned to a radio studio, and several more before I could write again. At the time I was doing a late-night phone-in show and I talked about my dad on air. Callers shared their experiences, many were looking for a way – to be given permission, almost – to say that they were still feeling the effects of grief, long after the actual loss. One caller sobbed as she told me she felt so unable to talk about it with friends or colleagues that an online grief forum online was the only place she felt able to share what felt like a dirty secret.\nI watched at a distance as my mum helped physically hold up the howling young widow as the lid was opened on the casket\n\nGrowing up in the only Asian family in a Yorkshire village, I was aware of the cultural differences between my school friends and I. Never more so than when it came to mourning. South Asians have a very different way of dealing with death, and I was about 10 years old when I first experienced it. A family friend had passed away, leaving a young wife and three small children. As the mourners gathered at the family home, the dad of the house was brought home for one last time. I watched at a distance as my mum helped physically hold up the distraught, howling young widow as the lid was opened on the casket. This was real, raw pain. Shocking as it was to see, it didn’t frighten me, and looking at it with adult eyes, it seems somehow logical – after all, what would she have done with that pain had she not been “allowed” to express it? Where would all that emotion go? What might it turn into if kept in her body?\nBefore I went into the studio to do the pilot that day, I’d thought of nothing but the topic I had prepared. But as so often with radio, what was in my head came out differently once my mic was on. As I talked about my sympathy for junior doctors, I found myself relating the story of the day I got the call saying my dad was going to die. I began to talk about how I willed my dad to stay alive so that I’d get there in time, and about how I did get to see him and then begged him to hold on until my sister made it from overseas. It was his last promise to me and he kept it. It was awful, sleeping on the floor next to him in his hospital room, watching his body slowly shut down while finding ways to say goodbye. And some days the memory of it still is, but as my now boss said to me as we left the studio that day – it does get easier, but it never really goes away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:27:09.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
