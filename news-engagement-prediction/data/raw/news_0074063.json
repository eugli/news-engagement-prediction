Mr and Mrs Bryant suffered a ‘living hell’ Credit: RUSSELL SACH \nM r and Mrs Bryant suffered a ‘living hell’ after Danny Day, who suffered serious mental health problems, went to police in 2012 falsely claiming the fire chief, with an unblemished record, had raped him on one occasion at the local fire station 35 years ago when he was 14. \nThe case was finally quashed by the Court of Appeal which declared Mr Bryant innocent in July. \nBut Dorset police has still refused to apologise. Mr Bryant told The Sunday telegraph: “I think the stress killed her. You couldn’t prove it but it stands to reason that all that stress cannot have done her any good . \n“If Dorset police had given us a timely apology that would have helped Lynn. That is all we really wanted. What really upset her was that we asked for the paperwork on the police case and they said; ‘you cannot have it because it would go against Danny day’s human rights’. That really upset her.” \nMrs Bryant’s tireless detective work after her husband was jailed was a major factor in securing his release. \nEvidence uncovered by Mrs Bryant and her legal team showed Day, who waived his right to anonymity, had sought medical help for compulsive lying. Dave was sentenced to six years in prison Credit: RUSSELL SACH \nR upert Butler, the Bryant’s lawyer, who is bringing a claim against police on Mr Bryant’s behalf, said in a moving tribute: “Lynn Bryant was a woman of incredible faith. When her world collapsed in 2012 she stayed true to her instincts and stuck by her hero, Dave, knowing he was innocent and knowing that decision would cause her many problems. \n“She suffered social isolation and attacks on her house, gruelling journeys between Christchurch and Dartmoor for prison visits and financial hardships - even having to sell her beloved jewellery that held so many happy memories.” \nMr Butler added: “When Dave’s conviction was eventually quashed it was as much down to her tenacity as anything else. She fought against the system, in spite of formidable odds, and she won. \n“What she really wanted was for Dorset Police to admit it had failed Dave and to apologise, but this has not yet happened. \n“I have no doubt that the stress of these last four years of fighting tooth-and-nail took a considerable physical toll on Lynn that finally broke her body, but not her spirit. It has been a great reassurance to know that she and Dave were able to spend happy months together after his release from prison. Hers and Dave’s is an extraordinary love story that deserved a far longer final chapter.” \nDorset police was unavailable for comment today. \nIt has said in the past: “Dorset Police takes allegations of this nature very seriously and conducted a very thorough and detailed investigation. The findings of the investigation were passed on to the Crown prosecution Service who chose to prosecute.” Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:10:15.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
