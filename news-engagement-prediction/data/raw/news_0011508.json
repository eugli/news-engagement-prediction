The movie has been receiving a commendable response from fans, and its first day collections show a little above INR 44 lakhs at the Chennai Box Office. \"Amazing performance in #Bogan sir! Simply superb!\", \"You rocked sir what a performance.\", \"What a style Simply smart and class , you proved it again.. The acting was fantastic.. Your combination with jayam ravi rocks...\" are just a few among the many tweets that Arvind Swamy has been getting as bouquets for his performance in 'Bogan'. Yesterday, the actor had gone to a Woodlands theatre at Royapettah, Chennai, where he was hailed with respect and applause. It appears that the actor will visit a few more popular cinemas today in Chennai , including Kasi Theatre, Kamala Cinemas, Alandur SK Marlen and Vettri Theatres. At an age where actors and actresses don't bother to promote their own films, such humble gestures from Arvind Swamy explains why he remains a crowd favourite.
