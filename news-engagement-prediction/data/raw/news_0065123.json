Supplied \nRaw sewage from the town's sewer main on the back lawn of an Eltham family's home on Tuesday. \n\"This is people's raw sewage, but sometimes it has been Fonterra's waste. That was was so bad that it killed the grass and the worms, everything in the soil died because of the chemicals in it,\" Emma Loveridge said. \nREAD MORE: \n\"Everything comes pouring down the side of the house and flows around the bottom of the steps, it's disgusting. Our son has to walk through it to get to his room.\" \nShe said they'd had many conversations with South Taranaki District Council staff and contractors and Fonterra staff. \n\"The frustrating thing is that everyone passes the buck. It's been happening every year for four or five years. Every time we ring the council. They say its Fonterra's fault and Fonterra say its not their fault. \n\"We pay our rates and we've never been offered any compensation. I just don't know what to do,\" she said. \nTuesday's spill was not as bad as on previous occasions and the mess was cleaned up the same day by contractors with two sucker trucks, she said. Ad Feedback \nOn Thursday the family's lawn was covered with a coating of lime where the sludge had been. Loveridge said she was still keen to keep her preschool son off the area. \nSouth Taranaki District Council engineering services group manager Brent Manning said Tuesday's spill occurred when part of the sewer main was blocked off further down while contractors carried out some work on the pipe. \nIt was possible the return valve between the Loveridge's property and the main sewer was faulty and staff were checking this, he said. \nHowever, he said measures the council had already put in place made it less likely it would happen again. \nThe overflow problem was a historical one caused when the pressure in the sewer main became greater than the pressure in the Loveridge's domestic pipe during busy times, Manning said. \nIt was already happening less often since the council installed a non-return valve on the Loveridge's sewer connection and Fonterra had altered its discharge schedule to avoid busy times when the sewer main was full. \n\"We talked to Fonterra and they agreed to change their pumping regime to reduce the pressure and alleviate the issue in the sewer. The result has been better than it was,\" he said. \nA long term solution for the problem was to install a new section of sewer line directly between the Fonterra plant on Collingwood St and the sewer main, so the plant's waste was diverted from the loop that passes the Loveridge's property. \nThe council and Fonterra had already discussed the plan and design work had been done. They were still in discussion with Fonterra over how the costs for the work would be shared, he said. \n\"That's still a long term solution, from an engineering point of view, it's the right solution.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:22:57.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
