I’ve been wearing them since I was 16, hidden beneath my ugly, green school uniform. It felt like a secret act of rebellion. My partner doesn’t have a big thing about stockings, though he does compliment me on how I look. I’m a size 8 to 10 and, if I’m honest, I probably wouldn’t wear stockings if I was overweight. They’re a secret for my husband Sunita Andrea, 33, works in the financial services industry and is married to Danny, 49, who runs a chain of coffee shops. The couple have a ten-month-old son, Hari, and live in Surrey Sunita Andrea, 33, works in the financial services industry and is married to Danny, 49, who runs a chain of coffee shops. The couple have a ten-month-old son, Hari, and live in Surrey. Sunita says: I’ve worn stockings for all occasions over the past five years, since discovering how much more comfortable they are than tights — and how much sexier I feel in them. A lot of my friends live in trousers and jeans, but I love skirts, dresses and heels — and my legs are my best feature. My husband is the only person who sees my stockings, and I like it that way: they’re our little secret. And, of course, he loves stockings and suspenders — what man doesn’t? I also think they’re a lot more hygienic. The lingerie department is one of my favourite places in any department store and I spend up to £20 on each pair of stockings — about £160 a year. I gave birth to my son last April and knew that I was finally back to my old self when, just a few weeks later, I pulled on my favourite Jane Norman dress, Kurt Geiger heels and, of course, Wolford stockings. I went out to a restaurant feeling like the sexy woman I’d been before pregnancy. Tights hold in all the right places Michelle Jackson, 46, is a receptionist from South-West London. She has a 16-year-old daughter and a long-term boyfriend, John, a manager in international banking Michelle Jackson, 46, is a receptionist from South-West London. She has a 16-year-old daughter and a long-term boyfriend, John, a manager in international banking. Michelle says: I love tights and have only worn stockings once in my life, ten years ago when John and I were living in Perth, Australia. We chose them, plus a suspender belt, while out shopping together and I was happy to put a smile on his face. But the belt felt so bulky around my waist and, on the short walk to the restaurant that night, one of the stockings unclipped and hung loose for the rest of the evening. Our meal was ruined because I was feeling so uncomfortable. John has never asked me to wear stockings since, though he buys me lovely lingerie from Boux Avenue and Victoria’s Secret. I tend to wear flesh- coloured tights from Tesco or Sainsbury’s at work and black, or nearly black, ones from Boots or M&S when I go out, so I don’t spend a fortune on hosiery. To be honest, I’m surprised any woman prefers stockings — I can’t remember the last time a friend wore them. But tights don’t have the same sex appeal for men, and I can see why they find stockings more appealing. Under clothes, however, a sturdy pair of tights will pull you in at all the right places —and what woman doesn’t appreciate that? Tights are far more flattering Sharon Gage, 48, is a self-employed conference organiser.

She lives with her partner, Paul, 47, a furniture maker, in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. Sharon says: I love wearing bodycon dresses that are so clingy the only thing to wear with them is a pair of smoothing shaper tights. The tops of stockings and suspenders would be visible through the tight-fitting material, which would look dreadful. I buy my tights at M&S, for £10 a pair, and they come with a reinforced section around the waist, bottom and thighs, and really hold me in. I’m a size 8 to 10, but even so, without that extra support, I’d be self-conscious about my tummy. Rather than finding them a turn-off, my other half loves my tights and can see how flattering they are. Also, I’d worry about stockings falling down. Some of my friends only wear stockings — they feel they’re ‘more breathable’ — but shaper tights aren’t like control pants, which I once had to nip to the loo to take off partway through a New Year dinner because they were digging in so painfully. I love nearly black because they’re sheer and sexy, but I also have thick, opaque tights for when it’s really cold outside. And tights can last for years — unlike flimsy stockings. They make my uniform feminine Jennie Wright, 45, a nurse, lives with her fiance, Lennard, 54, in South-East London Jennie Wright, 45, a nurse, lives with her fiance, Lennard, 54, in South-East London. Jennie says: I have to wear a uniform for work, and it’s not the most flattering outfit, so I compensate by putting on a pair of pretty stockings underneath. They make me feel sexy and feminine. The thought that no one would guess I’m wearing them as I go about my daily job, taking blood from dozens of patients, also makes me giggle. It can also get very hot in hospitals and stockings are much cooler to wear than tights. My fiance is delighted that I choose stockings. I shop for them at Ann Summers and TK Maxx and pay about £20 a pair. I love all types of pretty underwear — what woman doesn’t — and have two drawers full of bras and knickers. There was one time, about three years ago, when I was in the middle of taking blood from a male patient and started to feel my right stocking rolling slowly down my leg. I crossed my legs to try to keep it in place, without him noticing, but then I had to stay seated until he got up to leave. I then dashed to the loo to pull it back into place. Thankfully I’ve never had anything so embarrassing happen since.
