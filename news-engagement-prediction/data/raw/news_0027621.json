Thanks to frequent checks & amazing doctors, all's well.\" \nHugh Jackman is the one and only Wolverine, but unlike the iconic X-Men character, the actor does not have a super healing factor. \nAnd it is for that reason Jackman for years now has had to undergo treatments for basal cell carcinoma, the least dangerous of skin cancers. \nJackman had another treatment on Monday and, as he has done before, posted about it to this massive social media audience — many of whom are presumably impressionable youth — and stressed to them the importance of wearing sunscreen. \n\"Another basal cell carcinoma. Thanks to frequent checks & amazing doctors, all's well,\" Jackman tweeted to his 7.4 million followers. \"Looks worse w the dressing on then off! WEAR SUNSCREEN.\" \nIn 2015, the X-Men star told ABC News he spent most his time during childhood outside with his siblings, under the scorching Australian sun. \n\"I don't think my dad or mom ever bought it or made us put [sunscreen] on,\" Jackman told ABC News. \nJackman is bringing Wolverine to life one final time for Logan , which is due out March 3. \nBelow is Jackman's recent post and the ABC News interview: Another basal cell carcinoma.
