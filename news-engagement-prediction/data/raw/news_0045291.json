GETTY The move to Paris would allow the prestigious university to retain access to EU funds \n“We want to say to British universities: ‘it can be a win-win game for you’. To have high quality institutions from the UK working in our territory, interacting together in terms of research and collaboration. \n“We are at the beginning of the process, so that by 2018, we are in a position to guarantee these things. The main idea is to get European funding through co-operation with the UK and other European institutions. \n“Of course this comes down to political considerations, but we are confident that European institutions will be working towards this, to allow this kind of project.” \nThe news comes following fears over the future of British universities after Brexit, when higher education institutions will be unable to take advantage of lucrative funding from the EU. GETTY There are concerns for UK universities over the loss of funding from the EU \nProfessor Alastair Buchan, Oxford University’s head of Brexit strategy, said maintaining education relations with Europe was essential to ensuring the reputations of Britain’s top universities. \nSpeaking at an Education Select Committee hearing last month, he told MPs: “We have got to be absolutely sure we are open; every student and every staff member that comes to Oxford is a benefit for this country because we recruit quality, people that play in the top league.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:03:53.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
