So in order to find out how an animal is feeling or what is making them sick, we have to look a little bit further and a lot of that depends on things like heart monitors,\" he said.\nThe Atlantic Veterinary College now has four heart monitoring harnesses after a Charlottetown couple helped raise $20,000 to pay for them. (Nicole Williams/CBC)\nThe monitor would be able to track Daisy's heartbeat and help identify the problem, but at the time of Daisy's collapse, heart monitors weren't available at AVC, meaning one had to be shipped in from North Carolina.\nGetting the monitor took a week and cost about $300 US to bring in, said Côté.\nShepherd decided AVC should have monitors.\nHaving them would cut rental costs in half and shorten the waiting time for results from a few weeks to a few days.\nThe heart monitoring harness Daisy wore had to be shipped in from North Carolina. (Submitted by Michelle Shepherd)\n\"Little did we know they were going to cost $20,000,\" said Shepherd.\nTo pay for the monitors, the Shepherds began having fundraisers, flee markets and yard sales.\n\"Anything and everything that would make money for us, we got together and did it,\" said Shepherd.\n'Truly inspirational' The Shepherds and other members of the community raised the money over four years and purchased four heart monitors for the hospital this past fall.\n\"This was truly inspirational because these folks who came here with their own pets and needed these monitors simply just wanted to make a difference and ... took it upon themselves to raise money,\" said Côté.\nShepherd said people were kind and generous.\n\"We were just a little piece of the puzzle,\" she said.\nDaisy has since died from another disease, but Shepherd said the monitors are a nice tribute to her memory.\n\"Everybody knew Daisy. Everybody loved Daisy. It's a good memory for her,\" said Shepherd.\nMORE P.E.I. NEWS | Armchair travel: John and Karen Clark's cruise of the Greek isles MORE P.E.I.
