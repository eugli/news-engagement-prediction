Photo by Jason Peterson \nHavas New York named Dan Goldstein as its new chief strategy officer. He will report to Havas NY CEO Laura Maness. \nIn the new role, Goldstein will be charged with growing the agency’s tech capabilities and creating a strategic direction for the agency and its clients. That will include a number of new clients Havas New York recently picked up from Clearasil and Air Wick (which Havas takes over from Droga5) and Dream Bed by Mattress Firm. \nGoldstein brings over 20 years of industry experience with him to Havas. Most recently he was the chief strategy officer and co-founder of LA-based research consultancy db5. He’s also headed up planning at TBWA\\Chiat\\Day and also spent time as a group planning director at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners. \n“From my first meeting with Dan, it was clear that he was the partner we’ve been searching for–not only warm and deeply passionate about understanding people and the culture and societies that shape them, but someone who shared our enthusiasm for intelligent creativity and our Together strategy. Dan will be instrumental in employing our strengths and investments in cognitive and data to unlock evidence-based insights and new levels of creativity for our clients and partners, and we’re thrilled to have him join the team,” Maness said in a statement. \nhttp://adweek.it/2lHH8sR copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:50:27.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
