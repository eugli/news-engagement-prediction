Douglas, who also has children Alfie, seven and Abbie, four, with partner Karen, 27, said: 'The redness started coming back, especially around the face and patches on the arms.' Today: Douglas persevered, and under the supervision of a doctor young Charlie's skin is almost healed from his sores Charles was covered head to toe in itchy sores which were caused by his skin becoming addicted to steroids in the cream By March 2014, Charlie had to be admitted to hospital, and at one point was even given morphine to help with the pain Charlie went to the doctor and was treated with Corticosteroid creams, an anti-inflammatory medicine prescribed for eczema. RED SKIN SYNDROME The condition is also known as Topical Steroid Addiction (TSA), and Topical Steroid Withdrawal (TSW). Its main symptom is red, itchy, burning skin which appears after stopping or between treatments with steroids for conditions such as eczema. It's described as an addiction because they body develops a tolerance for the treatment and needs great quantities to produce results. When the treatment is stopped or there's a gap, the condition 'rebounds' and is often worse. It is essential for a doctor to oversee the withdrawal of steroids and recommend other methods of pain management and symptom control. His condition conditioned to worsen and the toddler's skin would be constantly red and itchy. By March 2014, Charlie had to be admitted to hospital and was even given morphine to help with the pain. He even had to be sedated as hysterical Charlie was trying to pull off his own skin. Desperate Douglas said: 'It was so heartbreaking to watch Charlie like this. 'I spent most of my free time on internet, trying all the different advice: creams, diets, change all the soaps in the house. 'We couldn't understand how he was fine for a year and suddenly got so bad - and was worsening every day.' By the end of 2014, Douglas had changed Charlie's diet and all detergents in the house, and been to see a private allergist to try pinpoint his problems - but nothing worked. Dermatologists had prescribed 10 different Corticosteroids in creams and ointments to put on the skin. Charlie's skin condition becamse so extreme he was left with painful, weeping sores all over his legs Dad Douglas, right, who has three children with partner Karen, left, says it was 'heartbreaking' to watch Charlie in pain It was then that Douglas came across Red Skin Syndrome - which pins the painful condition on an addiction to steroid cream. Douglas said: 'Charlie was itchy and red all over, and it was becoming apparent he looked like some of the victims of Red Skin Syndrome. 'I considered the possibility that it could be the steroid therapy making him worse.' Douglas showed his research to four different dermatologists - who refused to accept that was the cause of Charlie's anguish. Frustrated, the dad decided to take his son off the creams entirely - going 'cold turkey'. Charlie's face covered in agonising sores: He even had to be sedated as the hysterical toddler was trying to pull off his own skin The youngster developed raw patches in the folds of skin under his knees after being treated with steroid cream Douglas admits he felt cruel going against all the advice he had been given by multiple doctors and dermatologists - but was so desperate to try something different. He said: 'I felt terrible, because what if I was causing my child additional unnecessary suffering for something I'd read online?' 'My partner put her trust in me, but I've been constantly doubting myself for several months.' A month after taking him off all the creams, Charlie's skin started to ooze, his skin got hot and started to burn and was even flaking away. He said: 'All the symptoms that people wrote about online had suddenly appeared.' The family had a consultation with Dr Marvin Rapaport, a specialist who confirmed the diagnosis.

'We were having to go back to hospital, each time doctors encouraged steroids.' The disagreement got so fierce Douglas was investigated by the child safeguarding board twice - as medics had reported the family for their decision not to treat his skin condition with medicine. In January 2016 Dr Rapaport gave Charlie a healthcare plan, and sent it to dermatologists who finally agreed with his suggestions. Charlie is now slowly starting to get better, and his sore itchy skin is finally recovering (pictured above when treatment was initially discontinued, and below now, having gone six months without eczema creams) He also found a Facebook group - 'topical steroid withdrawal - red skin syndrome support group' - which has helped the family share advice and experiences with their son. Charlie is now slowly starting to get better, and his sore itchy skin is finally recovering. Douglas said: 'It's such a relief to know that after all those months of our little boy being in agony, he is on the mend. 'We want people to know that children can get addicted to these eczema creams, and they sometimes are the cause of a worsening condition.'
