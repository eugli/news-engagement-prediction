It's unbelievable what it does. It eats you away. \nCATERS HEARTBREAKING: Harry died just moments after this photo was taken \n\"It was my worst nightmare come true. It feels like I've been in a parallel world after his death. Your whole perception on life changes.\" \nThe couple got a call from John’s daughter in February, 2015, saying Harry wasn’t well and they should return home. \nAs soon as they saw Harry they rang for an ambulance, and Louise said she had a gut feeling something was seriously wrong. \nCATERS HORROR: Medics told his devastated parents he was brain dead \nAs the rash began to spread over his body medics told the terrified parents that they needed to put Harry to sleep. \n“I knew he wouldn't wake up, he was looking in my eyes and I told him I would be here when he wakes up,” Louise said. \nThe parents' worst fears were confirmed when doctors told them his brain had swollen and he was brain dead. \nSince Harry’s death, Louise has been raising awareness of the importance of getting babies vaccinated against Meningitis B. \nCATERS ADORABLE: Harry's parents have campaigned for all children to be vaccinated \nFrom September 2015 this vaccination was included in the childhood immunisation programme for children born on or after July 2015 — after Harry's death. \nLouise added: “Harry was such a happy boy. He was cheeky and smiley. \n“He would always be laughing and smiling. He was such a happy and content little boy.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:15:38.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
