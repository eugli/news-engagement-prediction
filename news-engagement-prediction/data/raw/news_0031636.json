'The Lego Batman Movie' The gap is narrower than expected between the two films; 'John Wick: Chapter 2' wins over males with a $30 million debut. \nWarner Bros.' The Lego Batman Movie won the Valentine's Day box-office race with $55.6 million from 4,088 theaters, the top opening of the year to date even though it had been expected to clear $60 million or more. \nConversely, the erotic, S&M-laced Fifty Shades Darker came in ahead of projections with $46.8 million from 3,710 theaters.(tracking had suggested it might not even get to $40 million.) \nBoth films lagged when compared to the previous installments in their respective franchises. \nThe female-fueled Fifty Shades Darker came in 44 percent behind the record-breaking $85 million bow of Fifty Shades of Grey on the same weekend two years ago. Lego Batman paced 20 percent behind T he Lego Movie , which opened to $69 million in early February 2014. \nBad weather on the East Coast could have impacted Lego Batman in particular. In the spin-off, directed by Chris McKay, Will Arnett voices the role of the tiny Caped Crusader as the superhero tries to find himself and save Gotham City from a hostile takeover by The Joker (Zach Galifianakis). The voice cast also includes Michael Cera, Rosario Dawson and Ralph Fiennes. The critically acclaimed movie received an A- from audiences. \nFifty Shades Darker reunites Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan as the characters Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, respectively. The R-rated film drew a B+ CinemaScore, compared to a C+ for Fifty Shades of Grey (some complained the first film wasn't edgy enough.) \nAt the time of Fifty Shades of Grey , E.L. James' book trilogy — dubbed \"mommy porn\"— was a global sensation, with groups of women going to the theater together. The first film had the advantage of Valentine's Day landing on a Saturday night, as well as launching over the long Presidents Day weekend, which falls a week later this year. James Foley directed this time out. \nOverseas, Fifty Shades Darker is easily dominating, grossing $25.5 million fon Friday for an early foreign total of $48.2 million. It boasts the biggest opening day for an R-rated film behind Fifty Shades of Grey in numerous markets, including the U.K. ($4 million). The sequel should finish the weekend with $105 million internationally, the biggest opening of 2017 to date. \nJohn Wick: Chapter 2 , the weekend's third new entry, came in well ahead of expectations for Lionsgate with $30 million from 3,113 theaters — more than double the debut of John Wick in Feburary 2014 ($14.4 million). Keanu Reeves reprises his role as a former hitman coming out of retirement in the male-driven action film, which nabbed an A- CinemaScore. \nJohn Wick also stars Common, Laurence Fishburne, Riccardo Scamarcio, Ruby Rose, John Leguizamo and Ian McShane. \nLego Batman and John Wick currently boast the same strong rating on Rotten Tomatoes — 91 percent fresh — while Fifty Shades boasts a rotten 10 percent. \nSplit and Hidden Figures rounded out the top five at the North American box office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T17:50:49.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
