If I get an apology it will be a big help and it will be good for Stephanie because they branded her a villain.\nmedia_camera Eileen Piper, 92, whose daughter committed suicide.

Sadly and tragically she is not.”\nThe nation’s Catholic archbishops yesterday publicly apologised for the church’s failure to stop a “tsunami” of child sexual abuse in what they said was a “catastrophic” failure of the church’s leadership.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f820eb455aab36d6ceb03f40e65fd340?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/21e24239320e280c732381942ad225c4?width=650", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPCv2/?a=DailyTelegraph", "http://dailytelegraphatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/daily-telegraph-newsletter-sign-up.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-23T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:43:57.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
