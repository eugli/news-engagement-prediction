He was 66 years old. He leaves his adoring and devoted wife, Jocelyn Elise Crowley. He was a great guy, brilliant, hysterical, and moral. He was fiercely loyal, and the only thing he loved more than his work was his life with Jocelyn. He will be missed. The family has asked for privacy during this very difficult time.” \nColmes was the anchor and host of the Alan Colmes Radio Show on Fox News Radio. Colmes was also cohost of the popular Fox News Channel program, Hannity & Colmes . He was the unabashed liberal foil to Sean Hannity’s conservative voice, refusing to give an inch during the show’s 13-year run. \nHannity released a statement of his own in response to Alan Colmes’ death, saying, “[Alan Colmes was] one of life’s most decent, kind, and wonderful people you’d ever want to meet. When Alan and I started Hannity & Colmes , there wasn’t a day that went by where we didn’t say we were the two most fortunate men in all of television.” Who is Alan Colmes Wife? \nJocelyn Elise Crowley has a Ph.D. from MIT and is a professor of public policy at the prestigious Rutgers University.
