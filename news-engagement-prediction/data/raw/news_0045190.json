They have nothing else to play for. The FA Cup is something I believe is important for them.\" \nFor Lincoln manager Danny Cowley, the draw was a good one whatever the outcome of the Sutton v Arsenal match. \n\"It's a win-win,\" he told BT Sport. \"We wish Sutton all the best tomorrow, I genuinely hope they can do it.\" \nArsenal's fellow north London side Tottenham will host another giantkiller in Millwall, who ousted ailing Premier League champions Leicester on Saturday despite being down to 10 men. \n\"It's a cracking draw for everyone associated with this football club,\" the Lions manager Neil Harris told millwallfc.co.uk. \n\"The players have had the opportunity to test themselves against some of the best Premier League teams in the previous three rounds but in many ways this is another level altogether. \n\"Spurs are a fantastic side and this gives my players a chance to see how they can compete with some truly outstanding footballers. \n\"White Hart Lane is a fantastic stadium, a great place to play football, and it's a tie we're very much looking forward to,\" added the 39-year-old. \nThe other quarter-final pitches struggling Premier League outfit Middlesbrough at home to the winner of the replay between Championship high-fliers Huddersfield and Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. \n'Boro manager Aitor Karanka crossed swords with Guardiola when the former was Real Madrid assistant manager and the latter in charge of Barcelona. \nDraw for FA Cup quarter-finals made on Sunday: \nChelsea v Manchester United", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:28:30.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
