He was charged with subverting a constitutionally elected government and would probably spend the night in custody, Harrison Nkomo said.\n'Now we are waking up': Zimbabwe protests leader seeks international help Read more \nA police spokeswoman, Charity Charamba, said Mawarire was apprehended on an outstanding arrest warrant. “He skipped the country but, as you know, going to America was never going to wash away his crimes. We were waiting for him to return,” she said.\nMawarire encouraged Zimbabweans on social media last year to hold protests against Mugabe, who turns 93 this month and is the world’s oldest current head of state.\nIt was not immediately clear why Mawarire had been returning home. Some in Zimbabwe had criticised him for leaving the country amid the protests. At the time, he said he feared for his family’s safety.\nBefore he left Zimbabwe , Mawarire was detained and initially charged with inciting public violence before prosecutors changed the charges to attempting to overthrow a constitutionally elected government. \nA magistrate freed the pastor after ruling that it was unconstitutional for prosecutors to bring the fresh charges to court.\nMugabe had said Mawarire and others should leave Zimbabwe if they were unhappy with the country’s situation. The economy of the once-prosperous southern African state has crashed , and unemployment and frustration are widespread.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T21:30:00.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
