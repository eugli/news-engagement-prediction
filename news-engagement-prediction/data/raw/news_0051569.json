These not only have a structural role, but also serve to anchor services in the centre of each floor, freeing up space around the sides of the rooms. This gives the interior a much greater transparency and maximises the width of the building. This detachment also create unexpected vistas in all directions between the different spaces. \nREAD MORE \nBookshelves are positioned within the central core. \n\nIt also means the openings in the facades are not interrupted by structural elements. \nThere are no harsh boundaries inside – the spaces are always connected horizontally and vertically. \"By placing the volumes and staircase near the center of the house, intimate living spaces appear towards the public street and collective courtyard garden,\" the architects say. \"The living spaces are moderate in size and feel intimate.\" \nStairs lead up beside the plywood core. \nThe organisation of the living spaces reflects their use throughout the day. On the ground floor is a spacious entrance area and an open kitchen, connected to the collective courtyard garden through high folding doors. The living room and library, mainly used in the evenings, are on the first floor and look out over the lush garden and public street. \nA void in the living room connects the living spaces on the ground floor and first level. A netting hammock stretches across the void, providing views of the garden and sky, while the deep bay window of the library extends over the public street. This is detailed to frame the urban fabric. \n\"The most private part of the house, the bedrooms and bathroom, are positioned on the top floor. A skylight above the bathtub gives views over passing clouds and birds, and brings natural day light into the darker zone of the house.\" \nA netting hammock strung across the void provides a place to lie back and catch a view of the garden and sky. \nMaterials on the inside are simple and natural. The two vertical volumes are clad in pine plywood that the couple built themselves, and the rough in site cast concrete floors are not finished on the ceiling side, in order to expose the construction method. Rust stains on the concrete ceiling are a remembrance of the wet season in which they were cast. \nThe exterior features textural Brazilian black bond masonry, with two-storey windows opening up to the garden at the rear. The faceade remains more private towards the public street. The masonry bond functions as a veil that plays with light and shadow throughout the day. \n\"The street facade is detailed and materialised so that it builds on the surrounding urban fabric of the late 19th-early 20th century,\" the couple say. \"The modern house has its own identity with modern details, but still highlights the history of the small gap in the urban context.\" \nEach floor opens up to the floor below and above, reinforcing the connections through the house. \nAll photos courtesy of Gwendolyn Huisman and Marijn Boterman. \nBay windows provide ideal reading nooks, while the brick bond facade acts as a screen over other windows. \nStorage and service areas are located within the centre of the building, providing space and circulation areas around the side. \nA shower box is positioned on the outside of the bathroom box. \nWalls and surfaces in the minimalist bathroom are a soft green. \nOne plywood box-like form (left) accommodates the bathroom, while the other (right) hosts the toilet. \nThis architects' skitch highlights the function of each floor. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:15:07.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
