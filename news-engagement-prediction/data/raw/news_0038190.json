SHARE Google chief executive Sundar Pichai got an unusual job application. Photo: Michael Short \nHere is the letter from Chloe, who lives in Hereford, UK: \nImagine her surprise and delight when she got a letter back from the CEO of Google himself, Sundar Pichai, who encouraged her to follow her dreams, adding \"I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school! :)\" Advertisement \nBusiness Insider has confirmed the veracity of the letter. \nIn that LinkedIn post, Andy Bridgewater writes that it's a much-needed confidence booster for Chloe, who was \"knocked down\" by a car years ago. \nChloe's fascination with Google began recently, Mr Bridgewater says, when she asked him where his ideal place to work would be. Currently, Bridgewater works in sales for a refrigeration system parts manufacturer. \n\"And I said, 'oh, Google would be a nice place to work,\" owing to their world-famous perks and all of the cutting-edge work they do, he says. And so, when Chloe decided she wanted to work there too, her father encouraged her to apply and \"get the ball rolling,\" he says. \nChloe Bridgewater with her dad, Andy.

Bridgewater says that his daughter now wants to go on TV and talk to the media and use that to find some way in to the Silicon Valley-based search company. \nHe's largely resisted, wanting her to focus on her studies and develop her skills. Except now, the elder Bridgewater wants to brush up on his own technological skills to catch up with Chloe. \n\"Sadly, I think I've got to up my game,\" Bridgewater says. \nThis story first appeared in Business Insider.
