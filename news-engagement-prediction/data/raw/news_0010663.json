I met Michael Keaton last year which is pretty awesome.\nWill Arnett hasn't asked for tips for Batman (Photo: WENN.com) He plays the Caped Crusader in the Lego Batman Movie (Photo: Youtube.com / Warner Bros Pictures) \"I'm such a big fan of his in general, and I loved â€” he was the first Batman on film and I just loved what he did and I think he's awesome.\n\"And then I don't really know Ben but I've kind of gotten to hang out with him a few short times over the last year and he's a great dude. He plays this crazy brooding really muscular feels like he's going to knock you out of this planet Batman. So that's cool.\"\nRead More Ben Affleck quits as The Batman director and comments on the future of the film Meanwhile, Arnett is keeping tight-lipped about the voice he has gone for his lego-made part as he claims he's not allowed to spill details due to legal reasons.\nMichael Keaton in Batman Returns (Photo: Warner Brothers) Ben Affleck is the current live action Batman (Photo: Warner Bros) Asked if he can reveal his voice, he said: \"I can't. I'm all lawyered up. It's a Lloyds of London insured thing with Warner Brothers, Time Warner, and a bunch of other corporations out of the Cayman Islands and stuff.\"\nListen to Mark Hamill read Donald Trump tweet in the Joker's voice, but be warned - it's terrifying \nMeanwhile, the movie is said to feature a number of hidden references to the DC Comics universe.\nDirector Chris McKay has promised the upcoming family film will make superhero fans happy because he tried to incorporate as many characters from the comic books, original animated series and previous Batman movies into his saga as he possibly could.\nThere will be plenty of nods to other characters (Photo: Youtube.com / Warner Bros Pictures) The film looks set to be a success (Photo: Youtube.com / Warner Bros Pictures) And for some that he couldn't get the rights to, or were deemed too scary for family viewing, he found other ways to get in a mention.\nHe said: \"I just kept going until someone eventually said, 'We can only make this many or we can only get the rights to this many or we can't do this character because it will scare children.'\n\"If we didn't get a character, there's something in the signage of Gotham city, or a reference in a newspaper headline... There are little Easter eggs, some very overt.\n\"It's definitely a deep dive if you love movies, love comics and love Batman.\"\n  Celebs Newsletter Follow @MirrorTV Subscribe to our Celebs   Comments Show more comments More On DC Comics Inc.
