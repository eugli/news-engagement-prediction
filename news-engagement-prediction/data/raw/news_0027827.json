The results showed that married participants had lower cortisol levels than the never-married or previously-married people across the three-day period. (Shutterstock) \n“It is exciting to discover a physiological pathway that may explain how relationships influence health and disease,” said one of the researchers Brian Chin from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US. \nOver three non-consecutive days, the researchers collected saliva samples from 572 healthy adults aged 21 to 55. Multiple samples were taken during each 24-hour period and tested for cortisol. \nThe results showed that the married participants had lower cortisol levels than the never-married or previously-married people across the three-day period.
