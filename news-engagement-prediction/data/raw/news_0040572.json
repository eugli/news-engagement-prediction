State Police Sgt. Kim Riley said autopsies conducted in Terre Haute, Indiana helped to identify the girls as Liberty Rose Lynn German, 14, and Abigail Jay Williams, 13 of Carroll County. \nGerman and Williams were found roughly three-quarters of a mile from an abandoned railroad bridge, near Delphi, where they were dropped off Monday to go hiking. It was unclear who dropped the girls off. \nPolice said they are still collecting evidence at the scene of where the bodies were found. \nCarroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby said authorities do not yet have a suspect or suspects in the girls' deaths. \nPolice are not releasing a cause of death, and are not detailing any wounds or injuries the girls may have sustained. \n\"The investigation is still in its baby steps, so to speak, and we don't want to put that information out yet,\" Leazenby said. \nPolice urged the community to contact police with any tips they might have to help authorities in the investigation. \n\"We're going to get to the bottom of this. We feel confident. And we're going to do everything within our resources to reach justice in this situation,\" Leazenby said. \nRiley said that the deaths have sparked fear in the quiet, rural community. \n\"I feel safe for this community,\" he said, and added that people should remain \"alert and watchful.\" \nABC News' Lindsey Griswold and Jason Volack contributed to this report. \n\n  \" \nTeen   \n  \nRussia   \nCluster   \" \nNATO chief concerned if Russia missile reports prove true \" \nImmigrant takes refuge in Denver church to avoid deportation \" \nCalifornia officials rush to drain lake as new storms begin \" \nRussian spy ship 30 miles from US Navy sub base \" \nPope Francis: Native people have rights over their lands \" \nChina awards Trump valuable new trademark \" \nOfficials: CIA chief meets Palestinian leader in West Bank \" \nSlain brother was complicated part of North Korean dynasty \" \nSuicide bombings kill 6 in northwestern Pakistan \" \nReport: More than 55,000 US bridges structurally deficient \" \nIndia launches more than 100 satellites into orbit \" \nIntrigue surrounds arrest in apparent assassination of Kim Jong Un's brother In Seoul, assassination of Kim Jong Unâ€™s half brother engrosses, doesn't amaze \" \nHits and misses: Notable N.
