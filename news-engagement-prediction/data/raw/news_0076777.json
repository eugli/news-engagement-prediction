True, she can't reject you if you don't ask, but then again she also can't give you a handy in the Applebee's bathroom if you don't ask, either. \nBut confidence is key for things like getting phone numbers and smooches, right? Surely, when it comes to sex the best advice is to build rapport and use courtship to slowly make yourself irresistible to her, right? Yes — but not 100% of the time. \nAt AskReddit, someone asked the community to share their most aggressive sexual advances (we're talking legal and consensual here, obviously). While they didn't always work, the guys who shared success stories will make you think twice about all those shots you never took. The next time you're waffling on whether to ask her out, queue up one of these stories and remember that fortune favors the bold. \n2glamtogiveadamn : \nMy boss was a really good looking woman. A milf describes her quite well. Her personality was relatively flirty so we kind of traded pick up lines here and there, but playfully. We get sent to an event in Vegas, all expenses paid with a few other employees. As it came closer people were in an accident or quit so it ended up just being me and her. Day 1 in Vegas we get Hammered and we're dancing kind of hanging on each other all playfully though because that's what I thought it was. We somehow managed to find our way back to the hotel and she said \"I hope you have a good night.\" I responded with a great drunk idea of saying \"I think it will be, I'm going to finish myself off thinking of you.\" I was about to slap myself but she responded with a mischievous smile and said I outta come inside so she can show me around. We did horrible things to each other in that room, my love for eating ass was also born that night as well. It could have went pretty bad but the stars lined up for me in that moment. Please don't try to hit on your boss though there's a very good chance it won't go well \nTL;DR: Hit on my boss, she gave me a full tour of her birthing caverns instead \nIs hitting on your boss a good idea? No, probably not. Is somehow bypassing the flirting process and having sex with your boss without hitting on her good idea? It sounds pretty good to me. No downside, tbh. \nthisguy9898 : \nSleeping in the same bed with a girl at a buddies cabin (weekend trip with a bunch of us). We had never flirted or anything. Anywho. We're both in bed, about to go to sleep, I ask if I can go down on her, because i had never done that before. She was shocked, but she said maybe later if she couldnt fall asleep. 5 minutes later I was eating her out. Good times. \nThis probably wouldn't work much past high school or college, but sometimes it's not about romance. \nooo-ooo-oooyea : \nI had to get leg surgery, while I was out getting cut up a girl who was kind of on the periphery of our friends also broke her leg. So I'm walking around on crutches... she's walking around on crutches. Our eyes meet, and I said something like \"wanna find out if two people with two legs can f*ck?\". She said yes, and the answer is... no unless you have something to hold one of you up. \nAt the very least, they both got to check off an item on their bucket list that day. \nwoody65341 : \nWent on a first date with a girl from Tinder, just kinda walking around and getting to know each other. It's getting dark and we're sitting on a park bench talking. Forget what I said but she responds \"well that's surprising\". \n\"I'm full of surprises\" \n\"Like what?\" \nkisses girl \nMake out ensued and 15 mins later I'm fingering her on this bench and she asks \"Am I going to get to f*ck you?\" \nDidn't really think of it as bold at the time buy looking back I'd say it's my top moment. \nI'm gonna say that in this case, his date was the bold one. Also, Tinder sounds fun . \nThrowaway-account-23 : \nAt a fraternity party. Girl I'd been 100% talking to in a completely non-sexual, non-flirty way \"accidentally\" walks into the men's room and acts embarrassed. I was finishing up at the urinal and jokingly asked her if she wanted to hold it for me. \nShe held it with her hand in that minute, then with her mouth about two minutes later. \nWe never really think about how kind of gross blowjobs can be until time proximity to peeing is very near. \nThis is some very strong fratting. \nStanding in the line for taxis after coming out of a club. I stagger to the girl at the front of the que. \nMe: \"can I share your taxi?\" \nGirl: \"where are you going?\" \nMe: \"your house\" \nThere's a guy already in the passenger seat \nMe: \"who's this\" \nBrother: strong and stern stare \nMe: smiles and jumps in \nBallsiest thing I ever pulled off. (That's what she said too) \nWhile I appreciate the guile and determination, I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel for the brother a little bit. \nJJRL : \nAirplane. The one and only time I've ever sat next to a hot chick. I had 2 screwtop (decent Penfolds) bottles of wine I had bought at duty free. As soon as we took off, I said, \"wanna get fucked up?\" Four hours later and 45 minutes after landing, we were bumping nasties at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong. \nI have never been seated next to an attractive woman on a plane, but if I ever were this is exactly how I picture it going. \nSirMontego : \nI was at a party and a girl said to me \"can you hold my beer?\" I didn't know her or had talked to her before, but I said \"ok\" and she gave me her beer to hold. \nShe then took off her jacket and I handed her beer back to her like a normal person would do. She said \"thanks.\" \nI then said to her \"can I hold your beer again?\" \n\"Why?\" she asked. \n\"Because every time I hold your beer, you take something off.\" I said \n\"Follow me.\" She said. And I followed her upstairs and we did it. \nI love holding other peoples' beers. \nI almost don't believe this one, because it's a little too perfect. \nThe whole thread is great (and big), so I recommend scrolling through the whole thing .
