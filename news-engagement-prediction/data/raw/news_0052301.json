That site includes a tasting/taproom and research/development equipment. \nRuhstaller once operated a beer-tasting room at its hops farm, but Solano County officials turned off electrical power to the facility in April last year and ordered it closed to the public amid permitting and safety concerns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:56:53.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
