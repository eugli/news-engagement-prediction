Reuters | Posted by Jepher Christopher Nickels Ross Taylor became New Zealand's most prolific one-day international century. 2 Tyalor now has 17 ODI centuries, most by any New Zealand player. 3 Taylor also became the fourth New Zealander to surpass 6,000 ODI runs. \nRoss Taylor became New Zealand's most prolific one-day international century maker on Wednesday when his 102 not out guided his side to 289-4 in the second game of their five-match series against South Africa in Christchurch. ( Scorecard ) \nThe 32-year-old had joined Nathan Astle on 16 ODI centuries earlier this month against Australia in Hamilton and moved ahead with his 17th when he hit Wayne Parnell for his eighth boundary with the final ball of New Zealand's innings. \nTaylor had actually been caught at deep midwicket on the penultimate delivery by a diving David Miller, who then threw the ball back into play as he thought he was going to touch the boundary rope at Hagley Oval. \nTaylor combined with captain Kane Williamson (69) in a 104-run partnership and then finished the innings with an unbeaten 123-run stand with Jimmy Neesham (71). \nTAYLOR COMPLETES 6,000 RUNS \nEarlier in his innings, Taylor also became the fourth New Zealander to surpass 6,000 ODI runs when he back cut legspinner Imran Tahir for his fourth boundary to bring up his 50. \nTaylor now has 6,052 ODI runs, still well behind former captain Stephen Fleming's 8,007. Astle is on 7,090 and Brendon McCullum 6,083.
