Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAn eyecatching scuplture symbolising the Northern Quarter’s difference is to go replaced by 183 apartments built by billionaire bookie Fred Done. \nThe Big Horn has sat on the corner of Tib Street and Church Street since 1999 when it was built as a symbol that the area was developing into the city centre’s creative heartland. \nIt is a giant trombone structure that snakes around the remains of a red brick mill. \nBut the plans for flats, shops and a rooftop garden means it needs to go. \nScores of objectors complained about the removal of Cornwall artist David Kemp’s sculpture but plans have been approved. Developers assured art fans it will be ‘gifted’ to the city and kept in storage by the council while a new home for it is found.

How the site looks now (Photo: Steve Allen) \nMr Done’s firm Salboy teamed up with Factory Estates for the project. \nThe ‘Tibst’ joint-venture scheme has been dubbed ‘Citu NQ’. It is hoped it will help with the continued regeneration of the Northern Quarter and ease pressure on housing. \nThe site, currently used for parking for nearly 100 cars, is bounded by Tib Street, Church Street, Joiner Street and Bridgewater Place and is within the Smithfield conservation area. \nIt is surrounded by Black Dog Ballroom, the Britannia Sachas Hotel and the Grade II-listed Debenhams building. \nIt used to be occupied by a number of buildings, including the Rylands and Co. warehouse, which was demolished in the early 1990s. \nWhen the site was cleared, a section of wall at the junction of Tib Street and Church Street was kept to mount the Big Horn Sculpture. That will be bulldozed and the sculpture removed. \nThe tower block will be between 7 and 10 storeys high and contain 125 two-bed, 48 one-bed, two three-bed, and eight studio apartments. The proposed apartment block on Tib Street \nThe seventh floor will boast roof gardens for all residents and the tenth private gardens. \nThere will also be space for shops on the ground floor.
