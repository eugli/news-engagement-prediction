The Duchess of Cambridge has been spotted out in her favourite denims but fashion stylist Lauren Goodwin-Grafton asks if it's time she stopped wearing them Share Kate rocks her skinny jeans (Photo: Daily Mirror) Share Get celebs updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nShe may be royalty, but among a wardrobe full of designer gowns, and Jackie O inspired two pieces, The Duchess Of Cambridge loves her off duty denims as much as the rest of us. Who can blame her? \nPractical, easy to wear when rambling in the countryside, and comfortable for her mummy duties when paired with a classic blue Breton and blazer (her other casual chic staples), Kate’s love for the skinny jean reigns on from season to season. \nOur Kate’s grown quite a collection of denim , and we’re proud to say she’s not only fond of luxury labels either. \nJ-Brand’s 811 style and Hudson are particular high end favourites, but it’s always great to see her flying the flag for high street in affordable skinnies from Zara . Which always sell out instantly due to the Kate affect we hasten to add. \nBut it seems as much as The Duchess Of Cambridge adores her skinny fit jeans, she seems to be having a little problem with them . They keep falling down.

Popping on your jeans fresh out of the wash with a snug fit, to find by the end of the day they look like they are two sizes too big, and you are having to constantly hoist them up without no one looking. Nightmare. \nBut why does the The Duchess keep having this embarrassing wardrobe malfunction? Kate yanking up her skinny jeans on a visit to the Olympic Park earlier this month (Photo: WireImage) \nIt seems Kate, like us, has been accustomed to wearing her skinnies with a little stretch, which let’s face it are 100 per cent comfier than the original pure cotton jeans that flooded the market back in the 1950s. \nAnd although most ladies will shout hallelujah for Lycra from the rooftops; we needn’t worry half as as much about trying to pull a pair of denims over our lady lumps, the invention of stretch denim has given Kate, and us, one hell of a saggy jean problem.

Kate has to pull them up (Photo: WireImage) \nWell firstly Kate could invest in a belt to keep the waistline better supported, or even try a high-waisted jean which will sit further up rather than annoyingly slipping over her hips . Luckily for her height and svelte figure she could pull off this tricky style with ease. \nAlternatively Kate could ditch her faithful skinnies in favour for a pair of fancy flares. She sported a pair of shapely wide leg dungarees by AG in Vogue's 2016 June issue , and looked undeniably chic. \nSorry Kate, but some in the fashion industry have also predicted the skinny jean’s days might even be numbered. Kate's days in skinny jeans are numbered (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nShe needn’t fret however, not only is the wide leg jean an essential shape for spring so this Royal can stay on trend, they would actually be a very flattering fit for her boyish physique, even creating a little curve where needed. \nSo it might be a controversial suggestion to ask the skinny jean loving style icon to take her trews higher or wider, but with her skinnies causing hoiking havoc we wonder if she’ll take our advice pronto… poll loading Is it time for Kate to ditch the skinny jeans? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:01:04.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
