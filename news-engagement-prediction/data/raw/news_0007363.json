She is on the list of State witnesses expected to testify against him.\nShe suffered from retrograde amnesia and it was still unclear if she would be able to remember anything about what happened that morning.\nAfter Marli's recovery, she saw her brother briefly. However, the two were separated again. One of Henri's bail conditions was that he could not contact anyone on the list of witnesses until the end of his trial.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=1591390017&t=artid%3da31edeee-cc4c-438c-b079-fab63d93db18%26People%3dhenri+van+breda%26Places%3dcape+town%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=1591390017&t=artid%3da31edeee-cc4c-438c-b079-fab63d93db18%26People%3dhenri+van+breda%26Places%3dcape+town%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1"], "published": "2017-02-03T10:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:32:53.586+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
