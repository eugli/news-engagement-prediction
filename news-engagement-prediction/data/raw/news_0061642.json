(Chris Walker / Chicago Tribune) Becky Yerak plans to close 11 stores in Chicago starting in late February as part of a previously announced restructuring.\nThe Woonsocket, R.I.-based retailer has said it plans to close about 70 locations in several markets in early 2017, and on Friday it shared a list of Chicago pharmacies that will go out of business. \nCVS will continue to have about 80 pharmacies in Chicago. The pharmacy operations of the closing stores will be transferred to nearby CVS locations, so patients won't experience any service disruptions, CVS spokeswoman Stephanie Cunha said. \nCVS is also working with employees affected by the store closings to transfer them to other Chicago locations, Cunha said. \nThe following CVS Chicago locations will close by the end of March: 5360 S. Western Ave., 3411 W. Addison St., 4540 N. Pulaski Road, 2828 N. Clark St., 2825 W. Devon Ave., 120 S. LaSalle St., 2053 N. Milwaukee Ave., 6355 W. Belmont Ave., 2722 N. Central Ave., 3146 W.
