Media caption US immigration raids leave many 'afraid to open the door' \nThe new policy, which seeks to step up enforcement of existing US immigration laws, subjects nearly all illegal immigrants to deportation and speeds up their removal. \nIt also calls for sending immigrants caught crossing the border illegally back to Mexico, irrespective of where they are from, and deporting anyone charged or convicted for any crime. \nMr Tillerson and Mr Kelly will probably also face questions about the new guidelines in their meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. \nUS relations with its southern neighbour have also soured over trade-related skirmishes since Mr Trump took office. \nThe president has insisted that Mexico will pay billions for a wall along the US border, which prompted Mr Nieto to cancel a planned Washington visit late last month. \nMr Trump has also ordered a report, due on Friday, listing all foreign aid the US provides to Mexico. Media caption Where do America's undocumented immigrants live? \nIt is unclear why he requested the review, but its inclusion in Mr Trump's executive order on constructing a wall along the southern border suggests he may use it for leverage in negotiations with Mexico. \nMexican officials are also concerned about Mr Trump's pledge to renegotiate trade partnerships between the two countries. \nThe president has proposed to levy a 20% tax on Mexican imports to pay for a border wall. \nDemocratic senators urged Mr Tillerson and Mr Kelly to work through tensions with their Mexican counterparts on Thursday. \n\"We urge you to use your visit to disavow vitriolic rhetoric and forge a strong partnership based on mutual respect with the government of Mexico,\" the senators wrote in an open letter.
