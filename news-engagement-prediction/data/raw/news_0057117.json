Jurors Cry as Victims' Families Share Stories of Loss \nBranch AME, located about 30 minutes away from Emanuel, also holds a Bible study class on Wednesday night, the WCIV report said. \nDefense attorneys argued previously that there was no evidence to suggest that he planned to carry out a second church attack. \nRoof, 22, was sentenced to death last month in a federal trial for the 2015 massacre in Charleston, South Carolina.
