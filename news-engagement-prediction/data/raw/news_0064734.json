Early this month, Fish made yet another visual splash, this time in New York’s Soho neighborhood, with an enormous black-and-white mural (on view until March 31) commissioned by the Italian house. But her flourish for pattern doesn’t stop at her work—it can also be found wrapped neatly around her hair. “My whole obsession with the fashion industry started because of my love for scarves,” she explains of her penchant for pairing graphic and floral fabrics with what she’s wearing below the neck (a favorite is Hermès’s mushroom-spangled Champignon silk scarf by Anne Gavarni and Françoise de la Perrière)—“I feel like it finishes my look.” Photo: Courtesy of Jayde Fish / @mrsjaydefish Michele seems to share her sensibility, notably off a few of his more-is-more looks for the Spring 2017 runways with a crop of chromatic hair scarves fastened in large knots at the forehead. According to Fish, the look does double duty as an updo life extender. “When I have my hair in braids and want them to last longer, I will make a turban out of the large scarf and tie it in a bow at my forehead,” she says. For a sleek effect, she sweeps her hair away from her face by wearing “a larger scarf folded in half over my hair and tied behind the neck”—also a stealth route to hiding the effects of second-day hair or navigating windy avenues. Whether or not the hair adornments show up in tomorrow’s Gucci Fall 2017 show, we can most certainly expect to see them take flight on the street style set—each with a personalized spin, of course. “You can do so many things with scarves,” says Fish. In other words, there’s more than one way to tie one on.
