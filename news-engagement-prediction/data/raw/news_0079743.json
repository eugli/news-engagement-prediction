We just don't know. It's hidden, invisible, unmeasured,\" he said. \nThe chemical engineer is a 35-year veteran of the oil and gas industry. \nWhat he is looking for cannot be seen by the naked eye, or by an ordinary camera. But his is no ordinary camera. \n\"This is a sophisticated camera, military grade, that can detect invisible gases like methane,\" he said, showing me the $140,000 Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) video recorder. \n\"The way that it does that is it has got a special device inside that can cool down the inside of the camera to minus 200 degrees Celsius.\" \nAt these cryogenic freezing temperatures, the special sensors in the camera can detect methane being emitted into the atmosphere. \nHe shows me a gas vent on a ridge in the coal fields outside Chinchilla in Queensland. \n\"You flop it over to the infrared and there you see the invisible gas now made visible,\" he said. \nWhat the camera reveals is amazing: an invisible greenhouse smokestack venting methane into the atmosphere. Methane gas 'can be dirtier than coal', researcher says \nMethane emissions gain less attention than emissions of carbon dioxide in the climate change debate, yet, when it comes to global warming, methane matters. \nIt is a powerful greenhouse gas; up to 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide emissions that are causing most concerns about climate change. \nUntil recently, it has been viewed as less of a worry because it was presumed only tiny quantities of the gas leaked from onshore gas fields. Gas power appears to have been bypassed in the coal v renewables debate, writes Justine Parker. \nBut evidence emerging across the globe of \"fugitive\" emissions from coal seam gas development is raising questions about the industry's image as relatively clean and green — the obvious transition fuel from coal-fired power to renewable energy. \n\"It depends,\" said Mr Forcey, now a specialist researcher with the Melbourne Energy Institute at the University of Melbourne. \n\"If you release enough of the gas — the methane in that gas into the atmosphere, then gas can be dirtier than coal; more than about 3 per cent emissions, it is actually worse than coal if you are making electricity.\" \nAlarming studies in the United States have detected methane emissions in some coal seam gas fields of between 2 per cent and 17 per cent. \nHow much methane is leaking from the coal seam gas fields here? \nNobody really knows. \nThe CSIRO completed a study four years ago but it only focused on the coal seam gas well-heads, not the vast infrastructure of seams and pipelines that now spread throughout the Surat Basin.

Questions raised over commitment to reduce greenhouse gases \nGISERA's latest research is focussing on \"naturally occurring emissions\" of methane; that has raised eyebrows, but Professor Barrett defends the focus. \n\"In order to extract the signal for coal seam gas emissions in such a complex environment, we need to be able to take away all the other sources of emissions into the atmosphere,\" he said. \nHe said CSIRO has sophisticated ways of determining the source of emissions, though other scientists are sceptical and think that, because little measurement work was done before extensive coal seam gas development, the horse may have bolted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:54:12.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
