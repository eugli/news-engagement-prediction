USA Today Network Sean Rossman , USA TODAY 5:10 p.m. ET Feb. 25, 2017 President Barack Obama makes a speech in Paris in 2015. (Photo: Pascal Le Segretain, Getty Images)   \nA group unhappy with the options for president of France is recruiting a familiar face â€” Barack Obama. \nThe Obama17 petition aims to gather 1 million signatures to convince the former U.S. commander-in-chief to run in the country's presidential election this spring. The movement's website said it wants to coax France out of its \"lethargy.\" \n\"We wish to strike a blow by electing a foreign president at the head of our beautiful country,\" the website reads. \"Barack Obama has completed his second term as president of the United States ... why not hire him as president for France?\" â€” Jean-Xavier Franco (@jxfranco) February 22, 2017 \nThe group says Obama has \"the best resume in the world for the job,\" and adds, \"it is still possible to vote for a president and not against a candidate.\" \nThe movement hopes to have all the signatures by March 15. In the meantime, a campaign organizer told CNN the group plastered 500 photos of Obama around Paris. \nObama faces one massive hurdle in the race, if he were even interested: He's not a French citizen and therefore couldn't qualify to run. @BarackObama @MichelleObama You see ? I am not the only one who invites you to save our country ! #yesyoucan #Obama2017 ðŸ˜‰ pic.twitter.com/TqclztLvWq â€” Alexandra Metral (@Alexandrametral) February 22, 2017 \nAn unnamed co-creator of the movement told NPR the campaign is definitely a joke, but hopes it could make people think about what could be done differently in French politics. \nFollow Sean Rossman on Twitter: @Sean Rossman   Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2mpRuL9 NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.
