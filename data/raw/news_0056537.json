She sustained severe burn injuries.\nShe was hurriedly rushed to a local government health centre where she succumbed to her burn injuries on Wednesday. Angry villagers later blocked roads and protested on the streets, seeking action against the accused persons. The blockade was lifted after the officials rushed to the spot and promised action against the culprits.\n“The cook had gone to fetch water after cooking food when the girl went near the school kitchen along with other students and fell into the tub with hot rice juice and later died,” the school principal Krishna Kumar Sharma told the media Thursday. \nBihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has ordered an inquiry into the death. “The government has taken the matter very seriously and severe action will be taken against erring persons after the probe,” chief minister Kumar told the media Thursday.\nThe state government also announced a compensation of Rs400.000 (Dh21,992) to the victim’s family.\nIn a similar midday meal tragedy in July 2013, at least 23 students died and dozens fell ill after being served toxic meals at a government primary school located at Dharmashati-Gandaman village in Saran district. The children who were served soyabean vegetable and rice fell unconscious soon after eating the lunch.\nThey were soon rushed to the government hospitals but many died on way to the health centre, prompting the authorities to register a murder case against the school officials. Later headmistress Meena Kumari was arrested and sent to jail. She still remains in the jail.\nDuring the course of inquiry it was found that that vegetable was cooked in the insecticide, instead of vegetable oil which killed many children, all aged between three and 10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:21:34.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
