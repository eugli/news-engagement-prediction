Quite Strange indeed. \nA baffled Sunny kept his answers short and most of them were ‘yes’. The child star, however, lit up when Kimmel asked him whether he had seen Lion King. The host then lifted Sunny up to recreate the signature movement from the hit animated film. Kimmel, who had parachuted candies for the Hollywood audience, had them flying down from the ceiling again, especially for Sunny. \nWatch | List Of Top 5 Indians Who Won An Oscar \n\nSunny has already impressed us with his performance in Lion and even Hollywood celebrities are totally in love with this kid.
