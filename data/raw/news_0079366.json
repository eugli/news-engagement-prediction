I get my hand told to me, and I play it the best I possibly can. WRESTLEMANIA PLANS \n“As far as WrestleMania is concerned, whatever I’m supposed to do I’m going to do to the best of my ability. I can reference last year as a great example. \n“I was ready, healthy, and one-hundred percent activated by early March, and I was told that I would be assisting The Rock in WrestleMania. Quite honestly, if it weren’t for The Rock’s involvement in WrestleMania, I would have been told that I would have been sitting out WrestleMania. \n“[People ask] why don’t I just go in there and say, ‘I want to do this?’ Last year, I should have said, ‘I want to do this,’ but that’s just not what I do. This is why I love what I do.” \nWhile we clearly don’t know the exact details of what goes on behind the scenes, it sounds like Cena didn’t have much input in his role at this year’s WrestleMania. \nWhat do you make of John Cena’s potential role at WrestleMania 33?
