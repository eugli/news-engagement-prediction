But in the streetwear community, Walsh is better known as @dinneranddance and is something of a celebrity. Over the past few years, amid the boxes of tangerine and bananas, Walsh has become a tourist destination in his own right thanks to his outré Supreme combinations, attracting sightseers and die-hard lovers of the label alike. He eventually caught the eye of photographer Ben Awin of @Ben_Awin , who typically focuses his camera on the city's well-dressed youth. “I was chilling in Soho shooting pictures for my Instagram and I saw Lance at his stall off of Berwick Street selling fruits and vegetables. He was in head-to-toe Supreme and looked ‘mad,’ ” writes photographer Awin. “I asked him if I could snap a picture of him. It took off and went all over the Internet.” Since then, Awin has captured Walsh’s looks on a weekly basis, which include pieces like pink and black hoodies emblazoned with the label’s name; vests in fleece or in checked patterns; and a rotating collection of headgear, like sweatbands and ushankas . Walsh made his first Supreme purchase—a hat—about three years ago at a Supreme store located not far from his fruit stall. Since then, he’s amassed quite the collection. “I have about 50 pieces,” says Walsh via FaceTime, dressed in a Supreme x North Face leaf-print camo coat and pants. “Hats, T-shirts, I got loads of it!” Though Walsh may have an outsized collection of the brand, he claims to be motivated by practical concerns. The looks, he says provide stellar insulation against London’s cold and rain. “It’s comfortable and it does its job,” says Walsh. “I just wear it for what it is made for. I’m in this market the whole time. It’s good. It keeps me warm.” Even Supreme’s youngest customers echo their approval. “I like his style because he buys what he actually likes,” says 14-year-old Supreme fanatic Nathan Rosen , “He doesn't follow the hype and trends.” And, after all, isn’t that what personal style comes down to?
