Snelgrove said the woman was aware of everything that happened.\nA toxicology expert who testified for the defence suggested the woman had an alcohol-induced blackout, which is why she can't remember certain details of the night in question.\nPiercey told the jurors that the complainant was sober enough to give Snelgrove directions to her apartment, and there was no evidence she passed out.\nHe said they cannot convict unless Snelgrove, a 10-year veteran of the RNC, knew she was too drunk to consent and had sex with her anyway.\nHaving sex instead of protecting public: Crown Crown prosecutor, Lloyd Strickland, told the jurors the woman could not have consented if she was drunk, unconscious or asleep.\nHe reminded them the complainant said she came to while Snelgrove was having sex with her.\nCrown prosecutor Lloyd Strickland says the woman could not give consent if she was unconscious or asleep. (Glenn Payette/CBC)\nStrickland said if the woman was too drunk to give consent, then the jury has to convict, and called the constable's claim that she initiated sex \"self serving.\"\nHe also talked about Snelgrove's credibility, saying the officer did not follow protocol and tell the RNC communications centre that he was driving the woman home, reporting the arrival and departure times and mileage.\nStrickland said the officer was having sex when he should have been protecting the public.\nAs for the complainant's intention to sue, he said that is her right, and not relevant to the criminal case.\nJudge Valerie Marshall will give her instructions to the jury Thursday morning.\nWith files from Glenn Payette", "external_links": ["https://t.co/NJQzaRvjte", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/cbcnl?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/glenn_payette/status/834465478877798401"], "published": "2017-02-23T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:36:05.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
