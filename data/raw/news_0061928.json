Amazon is also thought to be working on similar sites in downtown Seattle and two in Silicon Valley.\nThe model could be a boon to U.S. beer makers, where overall sales fell 0.2% in 2015 to $105.9 billion, according to the latest figures from the Brewers Associations. Craft beer sales, however, were up 16% in dollar terms to $22.3 billion.\nCraft beer held 12.2% of the U.S. beer market however, compared with 71% of for domestic beer.\nCraft beer producers face an uphill battle, which could only be helped by Amazon. The beer market is dominated by one name - Budweiser-maker AB InBev ( BUD ) .\nAB InBev held 43.5% of the U.S. markets in 2015, and that was before it completed its \"MegaBrew\" merger with SAB Miller.
