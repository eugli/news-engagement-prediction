In the midst of a zombie apocalypse, most people would see a horde of ominous-looking strangers as a threat. But Rick—now a man on a mission—just sees them as an opportunity. He has all the willpower he needs to take on Negan and the rest of the Saviors—but he needs the manpower to match. From his perspective, why shouldn't these scary-looking strangers be his new best friends? EDITOR’S PICK The Walking Dead Season 7, Episode 9 Recap: A Rock and a Hard Place \nWe’re two episodes into the back half of The Walking Dead ’s bifurcated seventh season, and it’s already clear that Obsessively Motivated Rick is a lot more fun to watch than Broken Sad-Sack Rick. I still don’t think The Walking Dead needed to spend a whole half-season kicking Rick while he was down, but it does make for a pretty stark contrast from what Season Seven has delivered so far. \nOf course, Rick still needs to convince these people that they have something to gain by taking up arms against the Saviors. And this new group is weird. Really weird—almost like spending all their time in a rotting junkyard has also partially rotted their brains. They have dumb, fake-sounding names like Jadis and Brion and Tamiel. Jadis (Pollyanna Macintosh) serves as a kind of de facto leader. She’s the only one who talks, but she doesn’t talk much, intercutting her strange, clipped speech patterns with a bunch of hand signals that tell her allies what to do. These are not the most obvious or promising recruits for Rick’s anti-Savior army. \nBut it’s the poor general who blames his shoddy army. So how best to win these would-be adversaries over to his side? A post-apocalyptic gladiator battle. Jadis shoves Rick into the Walking Dead equivalent of a Rancor pit, and he squares off against a zombie impaled with dozens of spikes, like an undead porcupine. It is a goofy, ridiculous fight that is super fun to watch. \nRick wins, though he also takes a takes a spike through the palm of his right hand—which seems like it would cause significant problems for the rest of his life? But the only immediate problem is his inability to shake hands with Jadis, who agrees to join the cause on a few conditions. Her gang gets to keep half of the jars of food they stole from Alexandria. Rick and the gang will fetch her some new guns. And if, in the end, they actually succeed in toppling the Saviors, Jadis and the rest of her followers get to keep a third of everything they loot from the Sanctuary. \nThis is how new friendships are formed in this particularly bleak chapter of The Walking Dead , over a vow to work together to create a massive pile of corpses. But it’s the episode’s older, more intimate friendship that will really appeal to longtime Walking Dead fans: the long-delayed reunion of Daryl and Carol, which finally comes to pass. \nThe Walking Dead has been baiting fans with the possibility of a Daryl-Carol hookup since Season Two, when Daryl obsessively tried to find Carol’s missing daughter Sophia. Even in this massive ensemble cast, there are few bonds as enduring, or compelling. Characters die so frequently that it’s difficult to establish longstanding relationships we actually care about—and frankly, most characters aren't complicated or interesting enough to invest all that energy anyway. \nCarol is an exception—a character who started as one of The Walking Dead’s least interesting protagonists, and has grown, over many seasons, into one of its best. And while The Walking Dead ’s writers have arguably overindulged the many diehard Daryl fans by making Daryl a little too cool, Norman Reedus continues to bring the appropriate gravity to the role; his showcase episode in the first half of Season Seven was a rare bright spot in a dismal run of episodes. \nEven in this massive ensemble cast, there are few bonds as enduring, or compelling, as Daryl and Carol's. \nSo it’s appropriately electric when the pair finally reunite after so much time apart. The Daryl-Carol reunion actually starts with King Ezekiel's righthand man Richard, who tries to goad Daryl into helping him lead the Saviors to Carol’s isolated homestead. Richard knows that Ezekiel has a soft spot for Carol, and he suspects that Ezekiel might be enraged enough to change his mind and forge an alliance with Rick if the Saviors killed her. What Richard doesn’t realize is that Daryl has an even softer spot for Carol, and that there’s no chance in hell Daryl will agree to using her as bait. \"She gets hurt. She dies. She catches a fever. She gets taken out by a walker. She gets hit by lightning. Anything happens to her, I’ll kill you,\" he warns Richard. \nWe’ll see if the threat is enough to dissuade Richard from his long-term plan—but for now, The Walking Dead backs away from the more sinister implications of what Richard might do in favor of the gooey reunion everyone wants to see. Daryl turns up on Carol’s doorstep, leading to a long, teary hug and an invitation to have some dinner and spend the night. \nTo what I assume will be the enormous disappointment of all those #Caryl shippers, Daryl and Carol still don’t kiss or have sex or anything—but the evening is very intimate and personal nonetheless. Both Carol and Daryl are stoic and self-reliant by nature, which is why it’s uniquely compelling to watch them mutually let down their guards around each other, secure in the rare trust they've developed over their long alliance. \nBut that trust is put to a different test when Carol grills Daryl about what happened after she left the group. She doesn’t know that Abraham and Glenn were murdered by Negan, or that further bloodshed is definitely on the horizon. She would certainly be a worthy addition to the cause. But moments before she asked what happened to the rest of her former allies, Carol explains why she left in the first place. \"I couldn’t lose any of them. I couldn’t lose you,\" she says, explaining that she would have sought revenge if anyone else had been killed. \"There wouldn’t be anything left of me after that.\" Taking her speech to heart, Daryl lies about their dark new reality, telling Carol that they cut a deal with the Saviors that left everyone alive and well. \nIn the morning, Daryl leaves for the Hilltop, ready to join the fight again. Carol stays behind, alone and content in the happy lie that her friends are doing just fine without her. Neither of them has an easy road ahead, but you have to imagine they’ll cross paths again someday. Watch now: Norman Reedus plays Walking or Dead?
