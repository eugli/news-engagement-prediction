But whether we tip it away, mix it into the yoghurt, or avoid the problem altogether by shaking the tub before opening, many of us have been content to remain in the dark over exactly what the watery substance is.

And instead of pouring it away, we should be stirring it into the yoghurt, as the liquid contains protein. The answer has been revealed! Do you know what the liquid is that appears at the top of your yoghurt?
