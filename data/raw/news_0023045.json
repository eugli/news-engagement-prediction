Karen Gillan, who plays Nebula in the Guardians of the Galaxy 2 , says the blue-skinned assassin is on a mission to rectify her relationship with adopted sister Gamora. Yes, the two ladies who came to blows and nearly killed each other in the first film will apparently come to something approaching an understanding in the sequel. \n\"She's â€¦ on a mission to find Gamora and rectify a few things there as well and we're going to find out a lot about their backstory and learn a lot about Thanos's parenting skills and maybe how dysfunctional the entire thing is. So we're going to chip away at those layers, which is really fun,\" Gillan recently told ComicBook.com . \n\"When you understand anyone's motivations for anything, I think you can empathize with them and that's exactly the case with Nebula here,\" she said. \"That's what I'm really excited about as an actress, because I want to empathize with my characters. And yeah, I think people might even feel a little bit sorry for her, if it's possible.\" \nGillan stressed that this won't mean a total change of character. \"Her default is very pissed off,\" she said. Well, at least some things never change. \nDirected by James Gunn and starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Michael Rooker, Kurt Russell, Bradley Cooper, and Vin Diesel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will hit UK cinemas on April 28, 2017 and open in US theatres on May 5, 2017. \nSeen something newsworthy? !
