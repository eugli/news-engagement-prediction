Bush, shared an excerpt Tuesday of her father’s famous “Islam is peace” speech delivered after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. \nThe 35-year-old tweeted, “‘This is not the America I know…’ just a reminder this am to teach acceptance and love to our kids for all races, all religions..” \nHer post included an excerpt of Mr. Bush’s speech given at Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., six days after the 9/11 attacks, The Hill reported . \n“The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That’s not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don’t represent peace. They represent evil and war,” the 43rd president said at the time. “Women who cover their heads in this country must feel comfortable going outside their homes. Moms who wear cover must be not intimidated in America. That’s not the America I know. That’s not the America I value.” “This is not the America I know…” just a reminder this am to teach acceptance and love to our kids for all races, all religions.. pic.twitter.com/32XohAGMv7 — Jenna Bush Hager (@JennaBushHager) January 31, 2017 \nMrs. Hager’s tweet comes amid mounting controversy over President Trump’s executive order that temporarily bans travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries with a history of terrorism — Syria, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Somalia and Libya. The order, which has sparked protests at airports across the nation since it was signed Friday, also suspends all refugee admission for 120 days, and refugee admission from Syria is suspended indefinitely. \nMembers of Congress, Hollywood and the media have fiercely criticized the extreme vetting policy, with some describing it as a “Muslim ban,” a term the Trump administration has firmly rejected. \nMr. Trump pointed out Sunday that there are 40 other majority-Muslim countries that weren’t affected by the order and explained that former President Obama imposed a similar pause on Iraqi refugees in 2011. \nIn the 2001 excerpt shared by Mrs. Hager, Mr. Bush declared that Muslim-Americans shouldn’t be intimidated to practice their religion freely. \n“I’ve been told that some fear to leave; some don’t want to go shopping for their families; some don’t want to go about their ordinary daily routines because, by wearing cover, they’re afraid they’ll be intimidated. That should not and that will not stand in America,” he said. “Those who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take out their anger don’t represent the best of America, they represent the worst of humankind, and they should be ashamed of that kind of behavior.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:06:42.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
