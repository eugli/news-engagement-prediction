The moment @MirelaCofficial realises it's a tie and the jury gets to decide. pic.twitter.com/fo4UGqx81Y \nThe result has caused a huge Eurodrama after an apparent friendship on Twitter between one of the judges, radio host Xavi Martinez and Manel emerged. \nThe below conversation (screen shot by Wiwibloggs ) took place before Xavi was confirmed as a judge. \nTwitter user @Magitorras was congratulating Manel on the release of Do It For Your Lover, when Xavi replied and promised to make the song â€˜an anthemâ€™. \nManel replied: â€˜Thank you brother! Hoping you are my talisman!â€™ (Picture: William Lee Adam / Wiwibloggs.com) \nA day later, he tweeted a photo of himself with Manel during the broadcast of his Los40 radio show.

Spanish politician demands answers after Eurovision scandal \nWhile RTVE stand by the decision and have stated that the rules were clear before the show and nothing untoward happened, after a huge public backlash across Spain, Deputy for Toledo Jose Miguel Camacho is now demanding an inquiry. Â¿QuÃ© pasÃ³ y por quÃ© pasÃ³ lo que pasÃ³ en el agitado y polÃ©mico #ObjetivoEurovisiÃ³n de @eurovision_tve ? Preguntas de @JoseMiguelCama1 pic.twitter.com/XnGggMAjKJ \nâ€” PSOE Congreso (@gpscongreso) February 13, 2017 \nCould Spain be forced to reverse the result? \nAmong the questions being asked is who approved the selection process and who was responsible for selecting the jury members and whether Spanish broadcaster RTVE has considered revoking the results of the show. History says this wonâ€™t bode well for Spain at the Eurovision Song Contest \nThis is the second time in three years that the Spanish final has resulted in a tie. \nIn 2014, Ruth Lorenzo, former UK X Factor finalist tied for first place with Brequette. \nOn that occasion, Ruth was declared the victor after winning the public vote. \nShe went on to finish 10 th at the Eurovision Song Contest, Spainâ€™s best result for several years. \nHowever, the chances of a good Eurovision result are not good if the song fails to win the public vote at home during its selection process. \nIn the same year, Germanyâ€™s Ann Sophie failed to win the German final but the winner decided he did not want to perform at Eurovision. \nAnn Sophie, who only came second in the public vote went forward but failed to score a single point at Eurovision. \nOur own Eurovision history has a similar lesson. \nIn 2008, Andy Abraham was knocked out of the British Eurovision final only for Terry Wogan to give him a wildcard return. \nHe went on to represent the United Kingdomâ€¦ and finished last. \nSwedenâ€™s 2013 entry by Robin Stjernberg failed to qualify directly for their national final, Melodifestivalen. \nHe missed out on a top two place in his semi final and had to qualify through the second chance round before winning the final by placing first with the jury but only second with the public. \nThe song finished 14th, Swedenâ€™s lowest result since 2011.
