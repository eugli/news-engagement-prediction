(AP: Evan Vucci) North Korea stepping up weapon tests \nThe North conducted two nuclear tests and a slew of rocket launches last year in continued efforts to expand its nuclear weapons and missile programs. \nKorean leader Kim Jong Un said in his New Year's address that the country had reached the final stages of readiness to test an ICBM, which would be a major step forward in its efforts to build a credible nuclear threat to the United States. \nHis comments prompted a vow of an \"overwhelming\" response from US Defence Secretary James Mattis, when he travelled to South Korea earlier this month. \nThough Pyongyang has been relatively quiet about the transfer of power to the Trump administration, its state media has repeatedly called for Washington to abandon its \"hostile policy\" and vowed to continue its nuclear and missile development programs until the US changes its diplomatic approach. \nJust days ago it also reaffirmed its plan to conduct more space launches, which it staunchly defends but which have been criticised because they involve duel use technology that can be transferred to improve missiles. \nKim Dong-yeop, an analyst at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, speculated the projectile could be a Musudan or a similar rocket designed to test engines for an intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the US mainland. \nAnalysts are divided, however, over how close the North is to having a reliable long-range rocket that could be coupled with a nuclear warhead capable of striking US targets. \nReuters/AP First posted February 12, 2017 14:25:00 Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T10:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:56:48.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
