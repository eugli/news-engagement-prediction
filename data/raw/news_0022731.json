Article continues below \nMany thought that the former champion would be back in time for the fall slate of UFC events, but his pursuit of a mega-fight with Mayweather has dashed those hopes. \nNow, Rogan said on The Joe Rogan Experience that he thinks there are only a few fights that would bring the outspoken superstar back into the company’s fold.

That, I think brings in close to two million pay-per-view buys. I really do. He did 1.5 million for Diaz II and 1.3 million for the Eddie Alvarez fight, where he won the lightweight title. \n“The other one is Tyron Woodley or whoever wins the rematch between Woodley and Stephen ‘Wonderboy’ Thompson for the 170-pound title. That is an interesting fight too because if he goes up, challenges at 170 and wins that… Jesus f***ing Christ, now he’s through the roof.” \nIt is not hard to imagine a scenario, like the one that Rogan paints here, that leads to McGregor earning a comparable sum to his big payday from these smaller fights. \nEven after meeting Mayweather, he will come back, but the question now is when will it happen. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
