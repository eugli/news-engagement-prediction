What will be the next steps and when can the merger be expected to be completed? \n\nWe will be waiting for the final notification which will carry the effective date. The merger will de facto effective from that date. Once the notification comes in, we will initiate the process relating to book closure, etc, and from the effective date all the five banks will merge into State Bank of India . \n\nCan we expect the merger to be completed in FY17 or can we expect it to be completed over the course of the next six to eight months? \n\nFor all purposes, the effective date will be the date of the merger. Much of it will depend upon what will be the effective date stated in the notification which will be issued. \n\nWill the finance ministry be giving a further notification of the merger or will the timeline be decided by SBI then? \n\nIt will come from the Government of India, Ministry of Finance. \n\nWill all the five associate bank merger happen at the same time or will it all happen in a particular sequence? \n\nFor all purposes, the effective date will be the date when all associate banks will be known as State Bank of India. The data integration will happen and I do not expect a very long gap between that also. I expect that maybe within a month or so all the data will get integrated into our data base. \n\nHow will the merger impact the capital needs of State Bank of India and what would the impact on your capital ratios? \n\nAs of now, we had done some kind of simulation and based upon that, we were in a very comfortable position even post merger as far as the capital piece is concerned. \n\nHow much will the provisioning rise post the merger? \n\nAs far as the asset quality is concerned, from the September quarter onwards, we had started converging. In fact, we had identified all the accounts which were NPA within the banks. So we had started providing for all of them, so that piece is also adjusted. \n\nMost of the associate banks have been reporting a high rise in NPAs. Have all the associate banks completed the clean-up of their balance sheet before this merger takes place? \n\nAs far as identification is concerned, it is all identified and accordingly provisions are being made. \n\nWhat will be the key advantages of the merger on the cost, the treasury operations, etc, and of course its impact on margins as well? \n\nPost merger, five head offices will not be there. So the administrative setup of these associate banks will be rationalised to a greater extent. It will help in cost rationalisation and in improving the cost to income ratio for the merged entity. Apart from that, the treasury should be integrated and because of the larger treasuries, it will lead to an improvement in treasuries also. All this will eventually lead to reduced cost of resources which in turn will help the merged entity to probably improve its NIM and also improve its lending rates also.
