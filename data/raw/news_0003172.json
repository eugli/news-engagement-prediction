The suspect cried out \"Allahu Akbar\" (or “God is greatest” in Arabic) as he rushed at a group of four soldiers patrolling the Louvre Museum, lightly wounding one, according to Paris police chief Michel Cadot. One of the soldiers at the scene fired five shots during the attack. The suspect was taken to hospital for treatment, where he was said to be in critical condition at midday. French Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve described the incident as “an attempted attack of a terrorist nature”. French authorities have yet to disclose any information about the suspect’s identity or nationality. The four soldiers targeted in the suspected attack were among the 3,500 troops deployed to Paris as a part of Opération Sentinelle, a nationwide security operation aimed at “protecting against and dissuading” attacks on French soil. A second person was detained at the scene for “suspicious behaviour”. \nFor more on this developing story, see FRANCE 24's live blog below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T17:59:36.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
