Only then, she says, did she understand that her employer was breaking the law and sought help. She ultimately had a psychiatric breakdown. Anti-trafficking and forced labor organizations consider foreign domestic helpers among Hong Kong's most vulnerable populations. So does the US State Department, which in its 2016 Trafficking in Persons report recommended that Hong Kong do more to prosecute labor traffickers, recruiters and employment agencies that exploit foreign domestic workers. It is also put Hong Kong on the Tier 2 Watch List because compared to 2015 \"the government did not demonstrate overall increasing anti-trafficking efforts.\" The report places each country onto one of three tiers based on their government's efforts to eliminate trafficking -- with Tier 1 governments doing most, and Tier 3 doing least. #MyFreedomDay: Students stand up to slavery on March 14 Tina Chan, project manager at the anti-trafficking organization STOP, said Hong Kong needs to step up its efforts to help victims. \"The truth is, whenever we come across a victim of trafficking and that person requires a shelter or medical support the answer we get from different government departments is no,\" Chan says. The government says it is taking more steps to protect domestic workers, including introducing a multilingual website educating them on their rights, and prosecuting and revoking licenses from employment agencies that break the rules -- and it says it has jailed at least one employer for abuse. At the same time, Hong Kong authorities have lodged an appeal over the judicial review of ZN's case. Both Chan and Ho hope that in the end the ruling will lead to criminalization of human trafficking and forced labor. \"If it takes one judicial review, two or 10 of them to push the government to start doing more to protect these victims, it's worth it,\" Ho says. ZN's employer has yet to be charged with a crime in connection to his case. Emiko Jozuka contributed to this report.
