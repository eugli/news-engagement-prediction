Tech was down as many as 15 points in the first half and needed a late flurry just to shoot 16.7 percent (5-for-30) for the half.\nJackson led a second-half resurgence in which the Jackets were a completely different team, scoring 50 points, the most for a half this season against a Division I opponent. It enabled Tech to overcome a 22-15 halftime deficit.\nTech did it without Stephens, who left the game at the 14:52 mark with an ankle injury. It was a re-aggravation of an injury suffered in the Notre Dame game. Stephens did not return to the game.\nTech (15-10 overall, 6-6 ACC) held the Eagles to 32.8 percent shooting from the field, 13 percentage points below its ACC average. Boston College (9-17, 2-11) was led by guard Jerome Robinson’s 17 points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T16:04:51.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
