We’ll try to help you here. Just remember, it’s not safe to share personal info on Twitter.”\n@centrelink Does centrelink ever answer its phone? 2 hours on hold last week fruitlessly, heading in the same direction today.\n— Leigh Sales (@leighsales) February 8, 2017 . @Centrelink @leighsales this is absolutely not your fault - Centrelink is so desperately underfunded - but 12/16 mins is just not true. pic.twitter.com/XvuplC37pI\n— Sally Rugg (@sallyrugg) February 8, 2017 Sales responded with a simple “Thanks for the tip” before asking the agency for a phone number that might be answered inside 10 minutes.\n“Hi Leigh, call wait times can vary. However, if you can tell us what you’re calling about we may be able to help direct you,’ Centrelink responded.\nSales hit straight back: ‘I’ve told you what I want: a phone number that will be answered in fewer than two hours’.\nCentrelink responded again: ‘Families line open til 8pm on 136 150, otherwise our other lines reopen 8am. Our average answer time is around 16 mins’.\nAnyone know if Leigh Sales has gotten through to @Centrelink yet? #abc730\n— Boba Khan (@Deyterkmahjerb) February 8, 2017 Surprising number of people in my twitter feed sharing stories of appalling waiting times to get through to @Centrelink on the phone.\n— Leigh Sales (@leighsales) February 8, 2017 Leigh Sales wants #Centrelink to answer the phone in under 2 hours. And so say all of us. https://t.co/kZ6BxsirjV\n— Helen Murti (@HMMurti) February 8, 2017 @JoshButler @WittaTwitta @leighsales BWAHAHAHAHA @Centrelink has no idea who Leigh Sales is. Classic Robot Human chaos. 😳😂😋😂😳🤖😮😳💡😜\n— Blue Book Art Robot (@ERN_Malleyscrub) February 8, 2017 Sales’ frustration became a hotly-followed topic with readers posting about their own long wait times.\nOthers speculated on why the popular TV figure would need to speak to Centrelink, with another quipping that the best way to get a response from Centrelink was to acquire a debt and wait for the Robo-debt recovery phone call.\nThe great question about whether Sales actually got through to the agency won’t be answered, however. A spokesman for the ABC confirmed the broadcaster would not be making a comment about the matter. And Sales has not posted an update about whether she finally got through either. The entire twitterverse left with many questions, but no answers.\nNews Corp phone Centrelink several times for comment, but the line was busy.\nTudge says no flaw in Centrelink system 1:19 Human services minister Alan Tudge says despite criticism, Centrelink's debt recovery system is working.\nJanuary 11th 2017 a month ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Tudge says no flaw in Centrelink system Is Leigh Sales still on hold at Centrelink?", "external_links": ["http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v2/origin:video_integrator.5lOWR1ODE6qMxf8uIKSuAqzskXiJ7xMe?t_product=video&t_template=../video/player", "https://twitter.com/ERN_Malleyscrub/status/829265885336567811", "https://twitter.com/Deyterkmahjerb/status/829468542365888512", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvideomam.news.com.au.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fgenerated%2Fprod%2F01%2F11%2F2017%2F282022%2Fimage1024x768.jpg%3Fcount%3D3&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.js", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Centrelink?src=hash", "http://www.news.com.au/national/leigh-sales-takes-to-twitter-to-criticise-twohour-wait-for-help-from-centrelink/news-story/ebb942a2f22e374515e917777861db2e", "https://twitter.com/HMMurti/status/829267333290008581", "https://t.co/XvuplC37pI", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.css", "https://twitter.com/Centrelink", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/ebb942a2f22e374515e917777861db2e?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "https://t.co/kZ6BxsirjV", "https://twitter.com/JoshButler", "https://twitter.com/sallyrugg/status/829230970276556801", "https://twitter.com/leighsales/status/829144109474394114", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/abc730?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/leighsales", "https://twitter.com/leighsales/status/829411257061040128", "https://twitter.com/WittaTwitta"], "published": "2017-02-08T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:54:18.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
