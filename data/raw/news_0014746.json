The parents of nine-month old child Salama, who was tortured to death by maid, told the presiding judge of Sharjah Sharia Court that they wanted Qasas for the maid. The father of the child also confirmed his family's desire to impose a strict penalty against the maid. The judge told the maid, who denied the accusation, about the decision of the family and advised her to see if she can convince the family to pardon her. The case was adjourned to February 27 for enabling the maid lawyer to provide defense. During yesterday's hearing, the mother, H. J., who was carrying her new born, said that she had no problem with the maid. She said that on the day of the incident she left home and her was baby was in a good condition. When she returned after half an hour, she noticed that the baby was not in a good condition and then fell unconscious. She did not notice her baby was beaten and she was informed about this after reaching the hospital. The father testified that he was in Abu Dhabi and was informed by his wife and hospital authorities of what had happened and said that he wanted the qasas . However, the maid denied the accusation , though during the police interrogation she admitted telling the mother that she abused the girl. The maid rejected the testimonies of the mother and said that her only responsibility was to feed the baby and take care of her. According to the prosecution the maid had beaten up the girl intentionally and then pushed her on the floor. Then she hit her head with a bat used to kill house flies. The girl sustained fractures on her skull and later succumbed to her injuries at the hospital.The severely assaulted baby who was suffering from breathing difficulties, was referred to Al Qassimi Hospital. The doctors conducted necessary medical tests, which revealed internal bleeding in her head and a swollen-fractured skull. The girl died after her admission at the ICU. The victim's father told Khaleej Times earlier that the doctor who noticed bruises and fractures in the skull had told him about the possibility of torture. So he immediately lodged a complaint at the Wasit Police Station. Read : Sharjah baby, beaten up by maid, dies in hospital He said that he suspected the maid because she was the one who stayed with the child all the time, as the girl's mother was seven months pregnant and was unable to look after her. He also told they have installed surveillance cameras in the house except the bedrooms. He alleged that the maid who found cameras everywhere used to hit the girl in a room where there was no camera. \"We did not realise that girl had been tortured at the hands of the maid, though once we noticed bruises on her body,\" the father said. He took the girl to Wasit Health Centre and the doctor told him that those bruises were due to fever as the child had vaccinations. The man added that the police had found many witchcraft tools in her possession after the arrest. Accused says baby fell from her hands Noaf Abdulla, lawyer of the accused, told Khaleej Times the maid said that the baby who was crying just fell from her hands and she did not throw her on floor. The lawyer said that they will investigate to see the cause of death as the girl had died after few days from her admission at the hospital. She said that baby was born premature and had health problems. She was treated at the hospital and yet to talk to the accused.
