I had heard about Tanglewood. I knew that Bernstein was involved in teaching there, and I knew he lived by Carnegie Hall at the time, so I took courage and went up and knocked at the door. He liked young people, as you know, and was most gracious — he accepted me as a student even though applications were done already. And he got me a scholarship, because I had no money. You also studied contemporary music at the summer course in Darmstadt, Germany. What was that like? I was there in ’49, right after the war. Hindemith was the great prophet that we had to learn about. I went there also in ’56, seven years later — completely different atmosphere. John Cage was the big name. I met him once, on a free day. He was hunting mushrooms. He said to me, “That’s a good example of what I’m trying to tell you: Look at these mushrooms. They don’t grow in straight lines, or in triangles, or in circles. One here, one here, one there. When the temperature and moisture are right, they pop up. This is what I want: The end goal is to free up your mind and get rid of all those rules.” Was it difficult for you, as a Seventh-day Adventist, to tell orchestras you would not rehearse on Saturdays, the Sabbath? I got an offer from the Berlin Philharmonic in the ’70s for a concert that involved a Saturday rehearsal. I said: “Unfortunately I cannot do that. Can we change the schedule?” And I got the letter, very negative: “You must understand that we have our special schedules, and if you cannot adjust to that we have no interest in you.” That was an important experience. Now it’s never a problem — I play every year with the Berlin Philharmonic. But you decided it was all right to perform on Saturdays? I thought of my father: He prepared his sermon very contentedly during the week; Friday at sundown he closed his books and joined the family; but on the Sabbath he held the sermon. I love to rehearse, to work with the orchestra. But on the Sabbath, we don’t study anymore — we just play what we have learned together. And that is a blessing for us all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:23:50.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
