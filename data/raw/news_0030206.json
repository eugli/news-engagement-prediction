Getty Images 8 The shocking events at St Louis house that inspired William Peter Blatty’s 1971 novel The Exorcist are now re-examined in a new book \nAnd so began a terrifying ordeal for nine priests that lasted nearly two months — and sent one of them tumbling over the brink of insanity. \nThis is the story of the case that inspired William Peter Blatty’s 1971 novel The Exorcist that, two years later, became the classic film of the same name. The shocking events are now re-examined in a new book. \nParanormal investigator Steven LaChance tracked down a diary kept by one of the nine priests who “cured” a 13-year-old boy living in the suburban town of Cottage City, Maryland, back in 1949, and it reveals horrifying details of his “possession”. \n8 Linda Blair as Regan in William Friedkin’s film version of Blatty’s novel \nHe said: “Nobody in that quiet neighbourhood had a clue about the battle of good and evil that was about to take place in that quaint brick house.” \nThe boy, known under the pseudonym of “Roland Doe”, began to fall ill soon after dabbling with a ouija board owned by his aunt. Eerie sounds started up around him within days — including the rhythm of marching feet and the beating of drums, apparently coming from nowhere. \nRoland was sent by his parents to stay with local priests for observation. One of them saw the boy’s bed levitating off the floor as he slept. \nThen the scratches began. Painful red cuts across Roland’s body that often spelled words. Trailer for iconic 70s horror film The Exorcist starring Ellen Burstyn \nIn February 1949, “LOUIS” appeared near the boy’s ribs, which his distraught mum took as a sign she should take her son to her hometown of St Louis, Missouri. \nThere, the family brought in a medium who conducted a seance during which the words “NO SCHOOL” ripped across Roland’s skin. \nA cousin sought out the help of Jesuit priest Father Raymond Bishop, who visited to administer a blessing. \nRoland’s bed banged and shook as deep, bloody scratches zig-zagged across his body. \nShaken, the priest applied to the archbishop, who agreed that a full exorcism should take place as soon as possible. \nThe ritual was led by Father William Bowdern, pastor of the church on the campus of St Louis University and began at 10.30pm on March 11, 1949. \nRoland’s reaction was immediate — and violent. \n8 When Father Walter Halloran — a student at the time who assisted with the exorcism — was later asked what the most frightening part of the ordeal was, he admitted: 'the markings on the boy’s body' \nAccording to Father Bishop’s diary, as the prayers began, the word “HELL” appeared on Roland’s chest and an image of the devil could be seen on his right leg. \nFather Bishop noted: “The devil was portrayed in red. His arms were held above his head and seemed to be webbed, giving the hideous appearance of a bat.” \nWhen Father Walter Halloran — a student at the time who assisted with the exorcism — was later asked what the most frightening part of the ordeal was, he admitted: “The markings on the boy’s body. I didn’t think there was any way they could have been self-induced. \n“When the evil spirit took over the child, there seemed to be nothing he could do about it.” Related Stories 'GHOSTS ARE ATTRACTED TO MY AURA' Katie Price says she was haunted by pensioners and had to get rid of ghosts to stop her kids screaming at night 'There's a bad man over there' Man films encounter with 'ghosts' in abandoned asylum where a 'dead girl' walks the halls my kid sees dead people Mums reveal chilling tales of having kids who claim to see GHOSTS spooked stars From Simon Cowell to Hillary Clinton… these are the celebs who think they’ve been haunted by GHOSTS off it ghosts Is this proof ghosts exist? Spooky footage 'shows possessed trolley being guided around a warehouse' heebie bee gees 8 The Roland Doe case was dramatised for the movie Possessed, starring Timothy Dalton \nRoland slept for a few hours, but when he awoke he battered his fists uncontrollably on the headboard and then onto his pillow. Later emerging from this trance, he claimed he had been fighting a huge, red devil that felt “slimy and very powerful”. \nHe claimed to have dreamed he had been at the top of a pit of fire, 100ft deep, and the devil had been trying to pull him into the coals. \nThe exorcism rituals followed for weeks. The priests would hold him down as they prayed while he lashed out with blows “beyond the normal strength of a boy”. In one session, Father Halloran had his nose broken. \nAnd while Roland writhed, he would spit, babble, scream — and sometimes sing, often in a “very accomplished and beautiful voice”, according to Father Bishop’s diary. 8 A 1949 Washington Post story reports on the Roland Doe case \nOne frequent recital was a section from Strauss’s The Blue Danube. Yet when lucid the next day, Roland had no knowledge of the music. \nInvestigator LaChance added: “The diary describes how Roland moves between these terrifying tantrums at night, and waking in the morning and doing something normal like playing the game Monopoly.” \nOne entry describes how “fiendish laughter filled the house” and there was the sound of shouting, like the “barking of a dog”. \nAnother entry documents: “There was filthy talk and movements, and filthy attacks on those at the bedside concerning mastubation and contraceptives, sexual relations between priests and nuns.” \nThe language led Father Bishop to note: “His expressions were lowly and smacked of the abuse of sex.” \nSteven said: “Over the years there has been speculation that Roland may have been subjected to some sort of sexual abuse in his past. Yet the kind of language he used shouldn’t have been familiar to a boy of his age in that era.” \nAnother favourite howl of Roland’s was to tell the Jesuits to “stick it up your ass”. At one stage, priests arranged for him to be baptised as a Catholic but on the way to the service the boy fell into a trance, grabbed the wheel and tried to run the car off the road. \nRoland’s haunting finally ended in April 1949 during an electrical storm at the Alexian Brothers Hospital in St Louis, where he was being helped by the priests. It is also where Father Bishop’s diary was found hidden decades later. St Louis University 8 The exorcism was led by Father William Bowdern, pastor of the church on the campus of St Louis University \nThe boy told them he saw a vision of “a beautiful man with flowing, wavy hair” holding a “fiery sword and standing over a pit containing a devil”. He sat up straight and declared: “He’s gone”. Just moments before, the crucifix on the hospital roof had been hit by lightning. \nYoung Roland went home — but the evil stayed. \nNurses at the hospital claimed that for years afterwards, the wall above the head of his hospital bed bore a large black stain that would reappear no matter how many times it was painted over. \nThat wing has now been torn down and the ground is a car park. \nBut on the spot beneath where Roland’s room was there is a deep crack in the asphalt. \nWithin weeks of being refilled, it reportedly always opens up again. \nBut during his investigations of the case — dramatised in 2000 film Possessed — Steven’s most chilling discovery was made at a nearby mental hospital. Twitter 8 The new investigation into the Roland Doe case has been conducted by paranormal investigator Steven LaChance \nHe said: “There was always talk about a priest who was connected to the case who was later housed on a mental ward in St Louis. \n“A source helping with my research told me on this priest’s deathbed in 1983 he grabbed a nurse by the throat and said, ‘I am going to kill you, f***ing bitch!’ And then he collapsed back in his bed. \n“Did the demon move into the priest after the exorcism?” \nIn the decades since, some who have analysed Roland’s case have suggested he was not possessed but was a mentally ill young man, perhaps suffering from schizophrenia or Tourette’s syndrome — conditions far less understood in the Forties. \nAnd although Roland has preserved his anonymity since, it is known he lived in Maryland, raised three children of his own and enjoyed a long career with Nasa. \nHe claims to remember nothing of his possession.
