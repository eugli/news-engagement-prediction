We are objective and balanced, verified news. We are an open platform for anyone who wants to engage in a civilised discussion.\"\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty broadcasts news and other programming in 26 languages to Russia, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Iran, and a range of other countries.\nCurrent Time has about 100 editorial staff at RFE headquarters in Prague and correspondents in the field, Aliyev said, and will deliver news, debates and documentaries. The network's name in Russian is \"Nastoyashchee Vremya\".\nIn Russia, which has narrowed the space for independent media in the past years, RFE/RL Vice President and Editor-in-Chief Nenad Pejic said digital platforms were the key strategy to win new audience and overcome distribution difficulties.\n\"The only platform we have is digital, and social networks,\" Pejic said, adding some viewers would also have access via satellite. \"Cable providers do not want to put us on.\"\nRFE/RL said in a statement Current Time had 160 million views on social networks last year under a trial operation.\nPejic said he saw no changes to the RFE/RL operations under the new administration of U.S. President Donald Trump who has said he wanted to improve ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"This company has existed for 60 years and we have a firewall between us and the U.S. government,\" he said. \"Nobody in the U.S. government is allowed to tell us what to do.\"\nSome officials in the State Department and the U.S. intelligence community have said they were worried that Trump is not wary enough of Putin, who considers RFE/RL's efforts \"to promote democratic values\" an attempt to undermine his government.\nOfficials in Moscow say Russia has a free and independent media. They deny using state media as a tool for political influence. They say some Russian state media outlets provide a healthy counterpoint to powerful Western media which, they argue, often push an anti-Russian agenda.
