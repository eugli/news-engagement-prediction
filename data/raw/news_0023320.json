The airline later told Local 10 News that most elite customers receive three checked bags for free. A police report obtained by the ABC affiliate states that an American Airlines employee approached an officer after the group arrived at 4:15 p.m. for a 5 p.m. flight and said that they \"all smelled of marijuana and were starting to get aggressive.\" The employee then declined assistance from the officer.
