The restaurant is on track for a late-February — possibly even February 20 — opening date, First National Building owner Bedrock Real Estate’s CEO Jim Ketai tells MLive . The chain has yet to confirm this timeline. The restaurant, which was first announced last May , has been making some major progress over the past few weeks. Signage was installed last week and the chain has been quietly posting job listings on Craigslist for the past month. On January 25, representatives from Shake Shack’s team confirmed to Eater that the restaurant would debut in late-winter but a mid-February opening bumps up that timeline considerably. The chain is known for its juicy Angus patties served on Martin's Potato Rolls and crinkle cut fries. The Detroit location is expected to offer concretes (blended frozen custard treats) made with city-specific ingredients such as locally-baked pastries. Customers will also, \"be able to hang out on the patio overlooking the park and sip on a selection of hand-picked wine and local craft beer.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:14:35.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
