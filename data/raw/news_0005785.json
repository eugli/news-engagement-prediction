A leaflet taped to the window of this business in Alpine gives a full description of Zuzu Verk, a Sul Ross University junior who was last seen Oct. 12. (Robert W.

Robert W. Hart/Special Contributor \nVerk studied conservation biology at Sul Ross State University in Alpine and graduated from Timber Creek High School in Keller. She was last heard from Oct. 12. \nHer boyfriend, Robert Fabian, was named a suspect two weeks after her disappearance. \nA reward for information on Verk's whereabouts surged to $200,000 soon after. \nHer parents, Lori and Glenn Verk, moved to the small town to search for their daughter full time, The Washington Post reports . Her mother said many people knew the 22-year-old because of her conservation work and her job at the Dollar General. \n\"She reflects who this community is,\" she said. \"She's kind of quirky and artsy and a lover of the outdoors. She's become an unofficial daughter to this community and this university.\" \nLori Verk has said that her daughter and Fabian went to the movies with friends on Oct. 11. She didn't show up for work or an exam the next day. \nAmong the people of interest identified in the case is Fabian's friend Chris Estrada, Alpine Police Chief Russell Scown told KOSA-TV . \nEstrada was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated and evading arrest on Jan. 22. Alpine police said he led officers on a short chase after running a stop sign in his Mustang, which was previously seized as part of the investigation. \nFabian chose not to speak at the grand jury about Verk's disappearance in December when he was questioned about his side of the story, KOSA-TV reports . \nEarlier in the investigation, he told police that Verk left his home about 3 a.m. Oct. 12, The Post reports . Neighbors told police they heard the couple arguing the night of Oct. 11, but Fabian denied that when he spoke to Lori Verk days later, the family told The Post . \nFabian's downstairs neighbor John Franco told KOSA the couple made dinner about 9 or 10 p.m. Oct. 11. \n\"You could smell their food, and you can hear their conversation and then laugh a little bit,\" Franco said. \"Then, it got quiet like after 11 p.m.\" \nSoon after, Franco and his girlfriend heard \"shut the 'f' up\" and then nothing else. \nThe couple fought often, Franco said, but that night, he said, Fabian kept pacing across the apartment. Then, Franco's girlfriend heard a loud thump just before 3 a.m., he told the station. \n\"She wanted me to go check, so I went to go check, and it was just Robert,\" Franco said. \nHe said he saw Robert get into his car alone and that Verk's car was parked outside until Oct. 14.
