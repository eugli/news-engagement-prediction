Wilding is the man credited with inventing the term Brexit in 2012. \nThey have been joined by a second set of claimants who have been identified only by the letters W, L, T and B. The second group of claimants say they do not want to be named for fear of being targeted by the type of abuse and threats that have been directed at Gina Miller , the lead claimant in the article 50 case at the supreme court. \nThe unnamed applicants have various nationalities and have brought the action in order to highlight the “ state of limbo ” into which they believe they will fall following UK withdrawal from the EU. \nThe European Economic Area Act 1993, their lawyers argue, established EEA rights in UK domestic law. Lawyers for both groups believe that parliament must authorise a separate departure process from the one it has begun for article 50 of the EU treaty. \nAdrian Yalland, a political lobbyist and founder of the Single Market Justice Campaign, said: “I have campaigned for parliamentary sovereignty and accountable government for 20 years and now I want parliament to exercise its sovereignty by deciding if the UK should withdraw from the single market treaty. \n“Parliament, not government, took us into the treaty and so parliament, not government, must decide if and when we leave. I voted to leave the EU but parliament did not intend the referendum to cover the issue of membership of the EEA. The government should stop seeking to stretch the mandate to leave the EU to cover things parliament did not intend the referendum to cover.” \n“The referendum was on membership of the EU, not the EEA, nor of [the European Court of Human Rights]. It was not an opinion poll on immigration. I want nothing less than Brexit. But anything more than Brexit is for parliament to permit. The government has a mandate, not a blank cheque. We are a parliamentary democracy, not an elected dictatorship.” \nYalland said that a hard Brexit would risk detaching Scotland from the United Kingdom. He added: “An independent Scotland may be unlikely to join the EU, but it is a credible candidate for EFTA membership – which would give it full membership of the single market.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:18:10.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
