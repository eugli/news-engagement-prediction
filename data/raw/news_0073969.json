That means he's sold more than $37.5 million worth of shares this month. \nApple shares hit an all-time high of $134.54 earlier this month. \nGore joined Apple's board of directors in 2003, and has received periodic stock grants, according to SEC filings dating back to 2007. Those filings show no other major sales of stock from Gore. \nGore is running for re-election to Apple's board at next Tuesday's shareholder's meeting, according to Apple's 2017 proxy statement. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
