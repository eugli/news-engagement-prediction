At the ceremony, they won the prize for Best Regional Production and received a rapturous reception from the audience as they made their way onto the stage. The Girls is based on the true story of the Yorkshire Calendar Girls, and the 2003 British comedy film Calendar Girls , which Tim also wrote the screenplay for. \nSTORY: Gary Barlow just washed his hair for the first time in 14 years The Let It Shine judges: Gary Barlow, Dannii Minogue and Martin Kemp \nIt's been a very busy year for Gary so far. As well as working on the West End production, he has been starring as a judge on new TV singing competition, Let It Shine . Gary appears on the judging panel alongside Dannii Minogue and Martin Kemp in the search for five men to star in a new musical based on the songs of Take That. He recently spoke to HELLO! about the project, and said that his former bandmates â€“ Mark Owen , Robbie Williams , Jason Orange and Howard Donald - were all on board. \n\"We're all so excited,\" he said. \"We're all producers of the show. This is our baby, really. It's a celebration of our career. Hopefully this music will live on way beyond our capability to perform. When we're in wheelchairs being pushed around an old folks' home, this musical will still be touring.\" The Let It Shine final will air this week, with guest judge Robbie Williams joining the panel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T13:16:06.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
