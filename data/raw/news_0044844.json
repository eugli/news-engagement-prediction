Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA stressed out mum has praised a shop assistant who picked up her restless toddler as she was about to abandon her shopping. \nMum-of-one Lauren Walker was in Marks & Spencer when she was ready to give up and go home, as the 10-month-old tot was being a little hard work. \nBut then shop worker Mubarak Ahmad came to the rescue, scooped up little Alistair Findlay and took him behind the till to scan his mum's shopping. \nLauren told the Daily Record : \"My mum, son and I were in the Uddingston Foodhall branch on Saturday and, while going round, my baby son started to get a bit restless as, let’s be honest, what baby likes shopping? \n\"However, the staff member, who I’ve since found out is called Mubarak, took the time with him to talk away so we could manage to get the trolley filled and shopping complete. He was a godsend. Lauren Walker with son Alistair Findlay (Photo: Daily Record) \n\"Then when we reached the checkout, my son was thrilled to see his new friend serving on the till.

It really just seemed second nature to him to help in this way and, to be honest, Alistair wasn’t impressed when it was time to leave and he was handed back to me.\" Marks and Spencer Uddingston staff member Mubarak Ahmad and his new friend 10 month old Alistair Findlay (Photo: Hamilton Advertiser) \nLauren, a hairdresser from Motherwell, posted a video of Mubrak’s actions to the Marks and Spencer Facebook page over the weekend, where he received huge praise from members of the public, with over 220 comments and 7,000 likes on the video.
