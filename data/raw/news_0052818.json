My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017 \nBut according to people who actually live in Sweden — and the cops who patrol the streets — Donald Trump is peddling in fake news. \nThe Fox News segment, which appeared on “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” featured filmmaker Ami Horowitz, who interviewed two Swedish police officers as part of his film, “Stockholm Syndrome.” But the cops that Horowitz interviewed, Anders Göranzon and Jacob Ekström, say their comments were taken out of context. \n“It was supposed to be about crime in high risk areas. Areas with high crime rates. There wasn’t any focus on migration or immigration,” Göranzon explained to Swedish website Dagens Nyheter. “We don’t stand behind it. It shocked us. He has edited the answers. We were answering completely different questions in the interview. This is bad journalism.” \nThe upset police officer also made it clear that he was appalled at journalist Ami Horowitz, whom he described as “a madman.” \nThere is no statistical evidence that immigration in Sweden has led to an increase in crime, the New York Times noted Monday. Not only has no link been established between an influx of migrants and crime rates, but drug offenses, robberies and thefts actually declined last year — although rape and assault did increase. The government has not provided data on the ethnic breakdown of individuals responsible for each type of crime. \nOne type of crime in Sweden that has undeniably spiked, though, are Islamophobic hate crimes . They rose from 327 in 2013 to 558 in 2015. \nThose facts didn’t stop InfoWars — the conspiracy theory-minded website that has long had a disturbing amount of influence on Trump — from trying to defend their friend. Editor Paul Joseph Watson has already vowed to send a reporter to Sweden to validate Trump’s claims. Thanks to @PrisonPlanet for following through on his offer to fund journalism in Sweden. We will be there very soon. https://t.co/cm5SzQ45cA \n— Tim Pool (@Timcast) February 20, 2017 Spectacularly backfired? 😄 Fake news. I'm funding a journalist to go there and do the investigation, as I promised. https://t.co/8WTqUZJ1rF \n— Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) February 20, 2017 \nI've followed through on my vow to fund an investigation of Sweden's migrant crime, will JK Rowling respond to this? https://t.co/hn5bB25Naz \n— Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) February 20, 2017 \nWatson tweeted tweeted images he incorrectly said were from Malmo. In response, Watson tweeted out a video of fireworks going off, in what appeared to be a celebration (Twitter users said it was something done every year for New Years). Earlier, I tweeted some photos that were not from Malmo. This was a mistake. As you can see, multicultural Malmo is actually very peaceful. pic.twitter.com/f6UToBDVEN \n— Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) February 20, 2017 \nTrump himself is doubled down on his claims about immigration in Sweden. Give the public a break – The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT! \n— Donald J.
