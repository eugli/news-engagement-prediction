Rooney said he spoke to Roethlisberger recently and believes Roethlisberger will be back for a 14th year. Rooney called it \"natural\" for a player with Roethlisberger's experience to think about the future. Rooney added the Steelers are probably \"due\" to address the quarterback situation in the draft. Backup Landry Jones will become a free agent this spring. \nRooney said he's not concerned about wide receiver Antonio Brown's antics. Brown drew a strong rebuke from coach Mike Tomlin after broadcasting scenes from the team's victorious locker room following a playoff win over Kansas City. Rooney called them \"small annoyances\" and said the team is committed to renegotiating Brown's contract in the offseason. \n___ \nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
