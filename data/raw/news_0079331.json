We agree that we need to protect the value of the existing licences in which the current owners have invested,” FFA chief executive David Gallop said in a statement. FFA CEO David Gallop (C).

That’s why we are now working with the clubs to determine the future structure of the leagues and the criteria for expansion. \n“We will examine these issues in detail and expect this work will take months rather than weeks. We know that those consortia that have expressed an interest in joining the league would want to be part of something that is financially sustainable and attractive as a sound investment.” \nFFA will also engage a corporate advisory firm to help develop models for a new structure and provide advice around the financial aspects of making promotion happen. \n“The decisions we make around the future of the Hyundai A-League/Westfield W-League will have an impact on every aspect of football in Australia,” said Mr Gallop. \n“That’s why we want to work with the clubs and other stakeholders on changes that benefit the whole game.” \nFFA will provide updates on the process over the coming months, and the existing joint working group that includes four club chairmen, will meet on Thursday to discuss this.
