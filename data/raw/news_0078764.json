Hays of the Indy Star . He was arrested on suspicion of robbery, auto theft, criminal damage, resisting arrest and driving under the influence. Per the report, Parry and two others were allegedly given a ride from a bar, and when the driver went to collect payment from the other two, Parry allegedly hit him in the head and stole his \"transportation cart.\" Police say they found the NFL player after he crashed into a gate. Fox59 provided Parry's mugshot: FOX59 News @FOX59 2/28/2017, 2:44:10 AM The 24-year-old was originally selected in the fifth round of the 2015 draft out of Stanford and immediately found a role with the Colts. He has started every game for the past two seasons and has been a solid contributor on an otherwise inconsistent defense. Parry totaled 47 tackles and three sacks during the 2016 season and was one of only two players on the defense to start all 16 games along with Erik Walden.
