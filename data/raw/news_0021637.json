Beyoncé’s label Sony Music and a company both owned by her and husband Jay Z (possibly Parkwood Entertainment) are named in the lawsuit as well. \nBarre alleged that both the “Formation” video and the Lemonade video album committed copyright infringement. However, the samples using Messy Mya’s vocals don’t appear on the hour film or actual album, only the “Formation” video alongside sound bits from Big Freedia . \nWatch The “Formation” video below.
