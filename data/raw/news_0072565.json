Been once, maybe twice? Given it up as a bad idea but forgotten to cancel the direct debit or still thinking about going next week? That’s how it normally works. As the Oscar-winning screenwriter Sonya Levien put it, \"Good intentions are not enough. They've never put an onion in the soup yet.\" \nWhich is to say, it’s action that counts and, unless you are really wedded to that cross trainer, I am the bearer of good news. \nThere are 657 muscles in the human body. According to new research from Upbeat Active, sending a text uses 38 of them, the quick sprint for the bus this morning pressed 99 into action, while a golf drive needs 137 (there are no stats available for muscles used whilst searching for your ball in the rough or throwing your Callaway Big Bertha Alpha 816 driver into the water hazard). Watch | Golf tips: the perfect iron shot 00:56 \nH owever, the key thing to take from this research is that, if you’re doing it right, sex will utilise all 657. If you’re doing it right. Call it working out while you’re lying down. Or standing up. Or whatever. \nPhysiotherapist and muscle anatomy expert Mike Aunger, who has worked with the Chelsea Academy, the GB bobsleigh and ski-cross teams and Saracens Ladies rugby, led the research. \"We require every muscle to fire on all cylinders,\" he says. \"In the bedroom, every muscle matters. All your skeletal muscles are essential for movement, no matter how vigorous; all your autonomous (involuntary) smooth muscles play a ceaseless role in digestion, respiration, circulation and bodily function; and of course your cardiac muscles are integral for pumping blood into all the right places.” Watch | Exercises to help improve your cardio 01:28 \nA ccording to the data, the bulbospongiosus – aka ‘the sex hero muscle’ – plays the starring role between the sheets for both sexes. Found in the perineum, it contributes to erection and ejaculation in men, clitoral erection in women, and the contractions of orgasm in both. It’s an equal opportunity employer. Regular activity with the lights off (or on) will, with the rest of the sex muscles, keep the bulbospongiosus trained. \nIf your partner needs more convincing to go for a quick workout upstairs, Aunger cautions: \"Inactivity is a modern day crisis. It’s one of the ten leading risk factors for global mortality according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and “insufficient activity” increases risk of death by a harrowing 20–30pc. The problem is becoming exasperated by jobs that keep us glued to our office chair all day. \n\"From birth to around your 30th birthday your muscles are capable of growing bigger and stronger. But once you hit your fourth decade your muscles are on the slide. This can leave you more at risk of injury and less equipped to handle the daily demands of everyday life. It’s never been more important to keep your muscles healthy. \n\"Physical inactivity can cause you to lose as much as 3–5pc of muscle mass each decade but you can slow the decline with regular exercise and optimal protein nutrition.\" In other words, it doesn’t depend on the size of your boat or the motion of your ocean: sex is a full-body workout that exercises every one of your 657 muscles no matter how you like to get down. Physiotherapist and muscle anatomy expert Mike Aunger \nA s I’ve explained to my other half, it’s crucial that in these days of desk-bound day-time existence we get as much exercise as possible – and no I don’t want any walking boots for my birthday. As the health professionals recommend, a good workout should be extremely regular, routine almost, at least twice a day and as vigorous as possible. That’s what the experts say. \n\"Ideally it should last more than 30 minutes,\" laughs Aunger, \"But I’ve got no stats on how long sex lasts for average British couple. To be fair, 45 minutes would probably be better.\" \nSo, in essence, looking after your muscles means you can enjoy better sex, be more active, live longer and happier lives. It’s time to start looking after your muscles gentlemen. Particularly the unpronounceable, unspellable but invaluable bulbospongiosus. And that can start by spending more time working out in the bedroom. \nFeel free to print this off and leave it lying around the house. \nT he research was conducted as part of a campaign to raise awareness for muscle health by Upbeat Active .
