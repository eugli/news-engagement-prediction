A photo posted by P!NK (@pink) on Feb 6, 2017 at 1:34pm PST The full text reads: \n\"For the record: Let's squash this before it even has a chance to be a thing…Lady Gaga killed it yesterday. Her voice was powerful and beautiful, her outfits were on point, choreography stellar, her heart was in it and she sang about love and inclusiveness, all in front of millions and millions of people. Let's celebrate a woman who has the guts to jump off a roof and stand up there in the first place. Who cares if I flew first? Cause I didn't! Cirque [du Soleil] and Peter Pan been in the air for years! Now can we get back to the real controversy? The one where our so-called leader is stripping our humanity away minute by minute…\" And that's a message we all can agree on. Frankly, any pop star who doesn't perform suspended from the ceiling is just slacking at this point, anyway.
