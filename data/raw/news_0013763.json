It needs court-approved premarital agreements on finance and parental issues,” she told the Sunday Mail .\nThe One Nation leader said under her vision for a “better Australia,” she would, she was Prime Minister, also cut the number of politicians, limit migration, introduce an Australian identity card, and axe the GST and consider a flat two per cent tax rate.\nShe would also set up a royal commission into Islam.\nSenator Hansen said one of her priorities was changing the family law system to ease the burden on the courts. She would force couples into pre-nuptial agreements outlining how they would deal with their children and assets if a relationship broke down.\nPauline Hanson has outlined her blueprint for Australia. Picture: Colin Murty Source: Supplied \n“Family law is high on my agenda. I just think it needs a complete overhaul,” she told the newspaper. “It needs court-approved premarital agreements on finance and parental issues. So before someone goes into a relationship or a marriage, you must have a premarital agreement. It would be confidential (and lodged with courts).\n“We’ve got to free up our court system. It’s overloaded. A lot of judgments aren’t being handed down for years.”\nShe said the public saw her as the woman next door rather than a career politician.\n“People see me as I could be their sister, their mother, their neighbour next door,’’ Senator Hanson said. “They don’t see me as a career politician ... They’ve seen me running a small business, rearing kids by myself. They see this person, I’ve had knockdowns, I’ve been in prison, I’ve come out of there and guess what? They haven’t beaten me, I’ve got up again. They can throw everything at me and I’ll still keep doing what I believe in.\n“I don’t change my tune, whichever way the polls are going. If you look at what I said 20 years ago, it’s exactly what I’m saying today. I’m a type of person who can make a decision. The past makes you more aware of what not to do in the future.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:50:57.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
