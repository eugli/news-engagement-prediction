The rendered image confirms a metal unibody design and presence of a circular camera lens at the back cover. The familiar Moto branding is right below the camera lens, while volume rocker keys and power button can be seen on the right panel. \nIn a separate leak, Major Droid has put out live images of Moto G5, which can be seen sporting a design similar to the G5 Plus.

However, Blass’s information conflicts Major Droid’s report that claims Moto G5 will have a 5.2-inch display. \nAccording to Blass’ report Moto G5 Plus will run Snapdragon 625, while the smaller Moto G5 will be powered by a Snapdragon 430 processor. On the camera front, the Moto G5 Plus gets 12-megapixel rear camera with dual autofocus pixels, while G5 will sport a 13MP rear camera, adds the report. \nTipster Roland Quandt of Winfuture.DE had earlier tweeted claiming the Moto G5 will be in stores shortly after the MWC launch. He had also put out the leaked pricing for the upcoming phones. According to his tweets, Moto G5 will launch at 189 Euro (Rs 13,500 approx) for the 2GB RAM+16GB version, while the 3GB RAM version will be price 209 Euro (Rs 14,800 approx). But the latest report hints, Motorola is sticking with only 2GB RAM on both phones. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:56:45.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
