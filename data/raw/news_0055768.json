Key points: The 76-year-old is being pursued over $3.5 million missing from a charity he co-founded The charity was placed into liquidation over unpaid debts Trajkov is also facing charges of cultivating a commercial quantity of cannabis \nBoris Trajkov, a former SBS radio journalist who was monitored by ASIO in the 1960s and 70s due to his close relationship with Yugoslav diplomats, was arrested in January for allegedly cultivating a commercial quantity of cannabis. He is also alleged to have stolen electricity while on bail. \nCourt documents obtained by the ABC also reveal that Trajkov, 76, is being pursued in court over $3.5 million missing from a charity he co-founded and operated for more than two decades. \nThe charity, the Victorian Multiethnic Slavic Welfare Association, operated a volunteer outreach service for elderly migrants from the former Yugoslavia until it was placed into liquidation over unpaid debts. \nThe association also operated a childcare centre in the suburb of Lalor, in Melbourne's north. \nIn a writ filed in the County Court of Victoria in December last year, the association's liquidators alleged Trajkov failed to account for more than $2.5 million in fees paid to the association in cash by parents for childcare services. \nThey also alleged Trajkov had not explained a further $700,000 in expenses and cash withdrawn from the association, as well as $190,000 transferred from the association's bank account to an account held by his wife, Slobodanka Trajkova. Do you know more about this story? Email \nThe association has since been re-established under new management. \nOn Monday, Ms Trajkova was in court as her husband appeared via video link on several unrelated driving offences. \nThe court heard that on two occasions Trajkov had given police a different name when questioned about his driving. \nAs she left court, Ms Trajkova said she knew nothing about the allegations of financial impropriety against her husband. \n\"I have nothing to say, I know nothing about it,\" Ms Trajkova said. No explanation for missing cash \nThe liquidator of the Victorian Multiethnic Slavic Welfare Association, David Vasudevan from Pitcher Partners, said Trajkov had not provided an explanation for what had happened to the charity's missing money.

(Supplied: Sasha Uzunov) \n\"At the moment we are trying to find out where the money went and in the absence of a proper explanation we are demanding compensation,\" Mr Vasudevan said. \n\"We have alleged that because Mr Trajkov had access to the cash, and also had paid those expenses, he should account to us about where those funds have gone and who the ultimate beneficiaries are. \n\"In the absence of that then we have alleged that the ultimate beneficiary would have been Mr Trajkov.\" \nIn January the ABC spoke briefly to Trajkov and he denied misappropriating any of the association's money. \nHe said that all funds had been invested in the childcare centre. \nHowever, the ABC has confirmed that since 2013 until its closure, the Lalor childcare centre was under review by the Education Department for breaching the child/educator quotas and for failing to have a responsible person on duty. \nThe childcare centre has since been refurbished and reopened by new owners. Interest from ASIO over spy concerns Photo: The 1969 ASIO file describes Trajkov as a non-worker. (Supplied) \nTrajkov migrated to Australia with his wife in 1967 and quickly came to the attention of ASIO. \nA year after arriving in Melbourne, a special branch memo included in Mr Trajkov's ASIO file claimed that illegal gambling was taking place in his cafe. \nIn 1969 a Victoria Police memo noted that Trajkov's cafe was \"frequented by thieves, rogues etc\" and stated that \"[Trajkov] is a non-worker and encourages persons of disrepute in his establishment\". \nTrajkov's interest in the restaurant business continued, however. \nMost recently he was the silent owner of the New Europe restaurant in Preston in Melbourne's north which often played host to touring singers from Macedonia. \nIn October 2015 two members of the Comancheros motorcycle gang fired bullets into the ceiling of the restaurant, and last year it was gutted by a fire which was deemed to be non-suspicious. \nTrajkov was awarded an Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday honours list in 1991 \"for services to the Macedonian and other communities\". \nThe Governor-General can terminate a person's appointment if they are found guilty of a crime or if they are deemed to have brought the order into disrepute. \nTrajkov is due to face court on the drugs charges in April.
