Amstutz Expressway would again be shut down for a day to allow a production company to film scenes for a TV show.\nIn this case, as recorded in the pages of your Lake County News-Sun , the production would be something called \"Chicago Fire,\" which was described as \"an NBC drama being filmed in and around Chicago and scheduled to premiere next month.\" \n\"'Chicago Fire,' which premieres Oct. 10 and stars Jesse Spencer ('House'),\" that 2012 article added, \"is the latest offering from producer Dick Wolf , who is best known as the creator of 'Law & Order' and its franchise.\" \nHere in February 2017, \"Chicago Fire\" draws something like 8 million viewers a week and has launched a franchise of its own — since that afternoon and evening of filming a simulated chain-reaction crash with multiple injuries, the series has given birth to \"Chicago P.D.\" (2014), \"Chicago Med\" (2015) and, coming to your television screen next month, \"Chicago Justice.\" \nGiven all of that, it's safe to say that the Dick Wolf library of \"Chicago\" TV shows has elbowed its way into consideration as the most successful Hollywood enterprise to use the Amstutz as a filming location. \nA strong argument can be made that the most notable use of the Amstutz was the Gotham City Police pursuit of the Batmobile in \"Batman Begins,\" since that scene included nearly 30 actual seconds of screen time shot on the lakefront roadway — from the time Batman emerged from Chicago's Lower Wacker Drive until he crashed through a lane divider and disappeared north of Waukegan's Greenwood Avenue. \nTrue, it was a relatively brief flash of fame, but \"Batman Begins\" ended up making $205 million at the box office, and its connection with Waukegan no doubt put it over the top. \nAlso near the apex of the Amstutz Hall of Fame would be \"The Blues Brothers,\" which featured even less than 30 seconds of speeding vehicles shot on location, but has also become part of the cultural zeitgeist; and \"Groundhog Day,\" which was in town 25 years ago this spring to stand in for a Pennsylvania highway just long enough for keen eyes to spot the old News-Sun building in the background every time the film is shown on TBS. \nWhen it comes to \"Chicago Fire,\" the Amstutz has become more than just a quick flash of screen time or even a longer flash in a single episode — the show came back in both the spring and summer of 2013 to stage accident scenes. \nIn fact, back in December, \"Chicago Med\" came to the Amstutz to, no surprise, film a fake accident. To paraphrase Gene Wilder in \"Blazing Saddles,\" when it comes to Hollywood mayhem, the Amstutz has killed more people than Cecille B. DeMille. \nAnd, on Tuesday — a brilliantly sunny February day that felt more like late March or early April — a Chicago Fire Department ladder truck could again be seen rolling up and down the Amstutz as \"Chicago Fire\" returned to its favorite easily closed highway. Passengers waiting for Pace buses at Sheridan Road and Washington Street peered down the ravine to see the hurry-up-and-wait action of a film production, and minor backups were experienced on northbound Sheridan by cars that would normally be flying along at 50 mph on a four-lane highway. \nThe word from the city was that traffic would be diverted onto Sheridan until around sunset for filming of sequences to air on an episode on a to-be-announced future date, and the Amstutz was expected to be back open for its standard use on Wednesday. Should \"Chicago Fire\" roll into a sixth season, bet on a return visit when another empty highway is on the casting call. \nTwitter@NewsSunDanMoran", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:01:28.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
