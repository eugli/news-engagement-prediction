Pin \nAt Forrester Creations, Ridge looks tense as Ivy tells Brooke there are some things she needs to know before she starts making wedding plans. Ivy toys with Ridge by offering to give them advice if they are considering getting married in Australia. Brooke thanks her and exits. Ridge asks Ivy what she’s doing. Ivy confronts Ridge about kissing Quinn. Ridge suggests she leave it alone. Ivy says he didn’t look committed to Brooke while kissing Quinn. Ridge works to convince her it didn’t mean anything – does she want to be the one to break up the family? Ivy will keep mum, but is watching them. Elsewhere, Steffy remarks on Thomas’ design, but he’s still disgruntled. Steffy wishes he could just get on board. Pam enters with the video of Steffy slamming Sally’s face into the cake. Thomas chuckles. Steffy remarks that the girl is insane. Thomas says it was a publicity stunt and does not make them enemies. They go back to discussing designs. Thomas feels he’s treated as a grunt. Steffy tries to be conciliatory, but Thomas tells her if she doesn’t like his designs, then don’t use them, and exits. \nRelated: B&B alum Susan Flannery directs episode of The Fosters \nAt Spencer Publications, Jarrett tells Bill the press was invited to Spectra Fashions’ preview but no one is going. Bill intones, “You’re going, Jarrett.” Bill explains that he wants that building. “And you’re going to help me get it.” He wants Sally to be so embarrassed that she’ll throw in the towel. Jarrett protests that he’s a journalist, not a saboteur. Bill replies that the pen is mightier than the sword, and Jarrett will do as he pays him to do. He opens the invitation on Jarrett’s phone and changes the RSVP to attending. \nIn the Spectra Fashions office, Sally, Saul, and Darlita rehash the cake incident with Steffy. Sally raves about the free publicity for their line. Saul frets about not having a full line yet. Sally just wants to give them a peek and announces they’ll have the preview right there in the office. Darlita reports that no one is coming – even Saul RSVP’d as a ‘maybe’. Saul swallows hard - he’s getting his shoes polished that day. The loan guy phones and Sally assures him the money will soon be pouring in. She disconnects and tells her staff they need press…now. Darlita’s phone sounds. She reports that Jarrett Maxwell is coming to their show! They start dancing and singing, “He’s coming to the show!” \nMore: B&B’s Obba Babatunde and Anna Maria Horsford in The Choir Director \nIn Bill’s office, he reiterates to Jarrett that he’s to sink Spectra Fashions by giving them the worst review.
