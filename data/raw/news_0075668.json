Everyone feared him. By his own admission, he was a dictator for the 22 years he was in power,” he said. \nTengku Sariffuddin also noted how Mahathir culled his political opponents in order to maintain his grip on power. \n“(Former) deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was sent to prison because he (Mahathir) said this country cannot have a prime minister who is homosexual. \n“(DAP veteran) Lim Kit Siang was said to be a threat to the Malays and was also imprisoned,” he added in a media statement published in the pro-Umno portal MyKMU.net . \nThe tiger, said Tengku Sariffuddin, has grown old. \n“Now, he is fond of Kit Siang, to the point of being willing to accept the de facto opposition leader to be deputy prime minister. This is in order for his (Mahathir's) son, Mukhriz, to become prime minister. \n“Now, Mahathir is colluding with Anwar and shook his hand. It seems, he is willing to accept a convicted homosexual as a Malaysian leader,” he added. \nAnwar, who is serving a five-year prison term following his conviction for Sodomy II in 2015, has maintained that the second sodomy charge, like the first during Mahathir's tenure, was fabricated by his political rivals. \nThe government has denied this claim. \nMeanwhile, Tengku Sariffuddin said Mahathir's U-turns are puzzling, and wondered if the tiger was becoming confused due to age. \nThe prime minister's aide also pointed to Johor ruler Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar's acerbic remarks last week regarding a politician, whom the sultan said could be a little senile. \nTengku Sariffuddin claimed that the sultan's observation was reflected in Mahathir's blog post, where the former PM stated that Malaysia was among the 10 most corrupt nations in the world. \n“The fact is, in the latest Transparency International list, Malaysia is the 55th least corrupt country in the world. It is clear that Mahathir lied or is unable to differentiate between fact and fiction. \n“The reality is that Malaysians can no longer trust what 'U-turn' Mahathir says. His remarks are embarrassing. He is either lying for political purposes, or is senile, as mentioned by the sultan of Johor. \n“It is best for this old tiger to retire,” Tengku Sariffuddin added. \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:43:53.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
