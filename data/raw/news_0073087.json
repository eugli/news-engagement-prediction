A computer, Mr Fresco says, is not susceptible to corruption.\nArchitect and designer Roxanne Meadows, 68, is the co-founder of the project and has worked with Mr Fresco since 1975 to develop and promote the Venus Project.\nTogether they want to build a place “where technology and the methods of science are applied to redesigning our social system with the prime concern being to maximise quality of life rather than profit,” she said in an interview with Futurism this week.\nThe dream of 100-year-old futurist Jacque Fresco and his girlfriend collaborator Roxanne Meadows.

Well, that is the underlying philosophy of the utopian city in the making.\nAccording to its founders, it will replace political leaders with engineered systems and do away with money all together. It plans to use artificially intelligent systems to solve social problems faced by the community and allocate resources.\n“This socio-economic system provides an equitable distribution of resources in an efficient manner without the use of money, barter, credit or servitude of any kind,” Ms Meadows said.\nShe points out that while we don’t have enough money to house everyone on the planet, we do have the resources to provide for all the world’s population. They want the Venus Project to be a microcosm of that idea.\n“You could liken this to the public library where one might check out many books and then return them when they are finished. This can be done with anything that is not used on a daily basis,” she said.\n“In a society where goods and services are made available to the entire population free of charge, ownership becomes a burden that is ultimately surpassed by a system of common property.”\nJacque Fresco and Roxanne Meadows.

They planted hundreds of trees, dredged the land, and began building examples of mass-produceable housing.\nCurrently on the property there are two dome buildings that contain workshops filled with hundreds of models and renderings for the utopian city. It is the nerve centre for what they call the experimental centre.\nTwo more domes house a steady stream of international Venus Project volunteers, who help spread Fresco’s ideas around the world.\nDespite the decades of work, the project remains very much in the imaginary phase.\nIn its current format, the compound is intended to illustrate what the outskirts of a city built in the image of the Venus Project might look like.\nDespite wanting to ultimately forgo a system of currency, they can’t escape the reality that capital is a major obstacle for carrying out the project.\n“We didn’t build what we wanted to build, we built what we could afford to build,” Ms Meadows told Bloomberg in June.\nFundraising efforts are currently under way, according to the project’s website which gives a detailed outline of its plan.\nThe HQ of the Venus Project.
