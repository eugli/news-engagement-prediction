But, seemingly unaware of the irony of declaring this in a white paper hastily drafted as a concession to MPs, by a government that opposed parliament getting a vote on triggering article 50, it added: “It has not always felt like that.” \nIt certainly has not always felt like parliament has been sovereign in recent weeks. But that has been because of Theresa May’s roughshod approach to democratic scrutiny rather than any edict passed down from the EU. \nParliament has been given a vote on article 50 not as a result of pressure it applied itself, but because Gina Miller took the government to court . Mrs May shamefully resisted all the way up to the supreme court. \nThe bill to trigger article 50 continues in that vein. While it might satisfy the courts, it is fundamentally undemocratic. There are no measures to give parliament a meaningful chance to scrutinise the terms of Britain’s EU exit. The white paper says only that parliament will get to vote on the final deal agreed with the EU. \nToo little, too late. After a lengthy process that includes approval by the European council, approval by at least 20 countries that make up 65% of the EU’s population, and ratification by the European parliament, it will essentially be a choice between any deal Mrs May has struck and crashing out of the EU after two years on World Trade Organisation terms, risking economic carnage. In other words, no real choice at all. \nThe terms of our European Union exit are no less critical than the principled decision itself on whether to leave the EU. Yet the government is, in effect, eroding any means by which parliament could scrutinise them. It is nothing short of outrageous. As the bill enters its Commons committee stage, the next few days will prove a critical test of the extent to which parliament is willing to assert itself. \nIt is all the more important given that there is much to be concerned about in a thin white paper that sheds little extra light beyond the prime minister’s speech two weeks ago. Her faith that we will be able to secure single market-style access for cherry-picked sectors, while ditching freedom of movement and renouncing dispute resolution by the European court of justice, is completely misplaced. The British people must have the opportunity to accept or reject the deal negotiated by the government \nHer belief that we will be able to negotiate a full deal within two years of triggering article 50 appears deluded, given that free-trade agreements typically take far longer to negotiate and ratify, even when they do not include the fiendishly complicated negotiations around services that she wants included in any final deal. There is an alarming lack of detail about implications for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. \nIt is imperative that parliament asserts itself in the coming days. The Observer supports the triggering of article 50 as the natural next step in negotiating our EU exit, but only if MPs, acting in the national interest, attach two essential democratic safeguards to the bill. \nFirst, parliament must be able to meaningfully scrutinise the terms of any deal the government negotiates with the European Union. This must mean the opportunity to reject any agreement before it goes to the European council for approval, and to give the government a mandate to seek further time for negotiation, should it reject it. \nAny MP planning to vote against the amendments to the bill that seek to ensure this – whether or not they supported Brexit – should reflect long and hard on precisely what they think parliament is for, if not to scrutinise the government on this most momentous of decisions. Second, the British people must have the opportunity to accept or reject the deal negotiated by the government. The referendum result provided a democratic mandate for Britain to leave the EU; it did not give permission to the prime minister to negotiate any deal she sees fit. \nVoters may choose to ratify the government’s deal in a second referendum or, faced with a concrete set of terms for Britain’s exit, they may choose to reject the deal and deliver a mandate for the government to seek to try to remain in the EU. But the final say should rest with them. \nAs the Brexit secretary, David Davis, has so eloquently argued in the past , leaving the EU is a process that requires two referendums. There are no legitimate grounds on which to oppose this additional layer of democracy. If parliament passes the bill without democratic safeguards, it would effectively be writing the prime minister, who has not even won an election, a blank cheque. \nLeaving the EU is not a black-and-white decision, but one coloured by shades of grey. Without parliamentary scrutiny, there is a real danger that the decision over which of the many existing exit doors that Britain takes is driven not by the national interest but by the political dynamic between Mrs May and the most hardline Eurosceptics in her party. \nThis would be a travesty. Opposition MPs and Conservative backbenchers must transcend party politics this week to ensure that these democratic safeguards are attached to the bill. It will take bravery, of the sort displayed by Gina Miller, who has been vilified by parts of the press and faced death threats for her role in ensuring that parliament has a say. \nIt now falls to parliament to ensure that her courage does not go to waste. There are those who will rush to label MPs voting for proper democratic scrutiny as enemies of democracy. Nothing could be further from the truth. We cannot allow these forces to continue in their drive to remake Britain in their own often narrow and spiteful image. \nNever have we so much needed our parliamentarians to stand up for the sovereignty of parliament and the right of the British people – not the purveyors of hatred – to have the final say.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:53:26.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
