That figure jumps by more than two-fold when President Donald Trump himself is staying in the building. Annually, this comes to $50 million if the president doesn’t set foot in Manhattan, or $60 million if he comes on the weekends. \nFDNY spending for just Melania Trump and son, Barron, will run the city an additional $4.5 million. \n“The NYPD now serves a dual role in protecting the First Family and securing Trump Tower while simultaneously acting as a municipal police department charged with serving and protecting the millions of residents, visitors, and workers in the city,” the commissioner writes. \nHe also points out that “Moreover, Trump Tower itself now presents a target to those who wish to commit acts of terror against our country, further straining our limited counterterrorism resources.” \nAn NYPD spokesman speaking to POLITICO explained that the “initial estimate to provide security for Trump Tower was calculated using anticipated costs. Subsequently, modifications were made to the security plan, and the amount was recalculated using actual costs.” \nO’Neal finishes his letter by saying that, by approving the reimbursement of costs, Congress will allow the NYPD to continue performing the “dual mission of securing a presidential residence while protecting and serving the millions of Americans who live in, work in, and visit our great city.” \nTo date, the federal government has reimbursed the city to the tune of $7 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:48:15.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
