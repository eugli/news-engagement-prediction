AP \nJAKARTA, Indonesia — A report on inequality in Indonesia says its four richest men now have more wealth than 100 million of the country’s poorest people. \nThe report by Oxfam says Indonesia, with a population of more than 250 million, has the sixth-worst inequality in the world. \nIt blames “market fundamentalism” that has allowed the richest to capture most of the benefits of nearly two decades of strong economic growth and pervasive gender inequality. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe report says extreme poverty has declined sharply since 2000 but 93 million Indonesians still live on less than $3.10 a day, which is defined by the World Bank as the moderate poverty line. \nOxfam says social instability could increase if the government doesn’t tackle the gap between rich and poor.
