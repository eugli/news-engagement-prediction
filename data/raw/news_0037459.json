The tweet quickly sparked speculation about whether the event would be held in Trump's capacity as president—he said in the past he'd potentially hold rallies as president—or for his 2020 re-election campaign. Join me in Florida this Saturday at 5pm for a rally at the Orlando-Melbourne International Airport! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 Turns out, it’s for his re-election.
