But his plans have been upended after U.S. officials reported finding “derogatory information” regarding Khateeb. \nDerogatory information is a broad category that can include anything from terror connections to passport irregularities. Asked for comment, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, Gillian Christensen, said, “A valid travel document is required for travel to the United States.” \nWATCH: Leader of White Helmets says situation in Aleppo is ‘terrible’ \n“The White Helmets,” a 40-minute Netflix documentary, has been nominated for Best Documentary Short. If the film wins the Oscar, the award would go to director Orlando von Einsiedel and producer Joanna Natasegara. Khateeb is one of three people credited for cinematography; Franklin Dow is the film’s director of photography. \nThe film focuses on the rescue workers who risk their lives to save Syrians affected by civil war. Many of the group’s members have been killed by Syrian President Bashar Assad ‘s air forces. The group also was nominated for last year’s Nobel Peace Prize . \n“The White Helmets” includes emblematic scenes of the deadly 6-year-old conflict: people digging through destroyed homes looking for survivors, at constant risk of “double tap” attacks that target first responders after they’ve arrived at the scene of a strike. \nWATCH: Syrian ‘White Helmet’ cries after rescuing baby from rubble \nKhateeb had been issued a visa to attend the ceremony with Hollywood’s biggest stars. But Turkish authorities detained him this week, according to the internal U.S. government correspondence, and he suddenly needed a passport waiver from the United States to enter the country. \nThe correspondence indicated he would not receive such a waiver. There was no explanation in the correspondence for why Turkey detained Khateeb. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:22:42.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
