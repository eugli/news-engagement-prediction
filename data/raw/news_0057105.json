She would now be a teenager. \nAppearing on This Morning , Mark Williams-Thomas said: “It’s such a well trodden story by so many and such a difficult story to tell now because there are so many legal implications. AFP via Getty Images Madeleine McCann went missing in 2007 \n“On that morning of Madeleine’s disappearance, we do know she went to [her parents] Gerry and Kate and said: ‘Where were you last night?’ \n“Because we know the twins did wake up on days prior to her disappearance. \n“And I think as a result of that, Madeleine was clearly aware they were in the tapas bar that was in the resort. \n“Now the interesting element in that is in order to get to the tapas bar you had to actually come out of the premises, walk on a public road to go back in again. Rex Features Mark Williams-Thomas appeared on This Morning with Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby to discuss the case \n“And that raises a concern I have in regards to Madeleine. I believe she woke up in the middle of the night, she went looking for Gerry and Kate and she left the apartment and went out. \n“Because we know the patio door at the back was insecure.” \nCo-host Philip Schofield then interjected to ask Williams-Thomas to stop theorising further for legal reasons. \nThe McCann’s spokesman Clarence Mitchell told MailOnline : “This is pure speculation and as such Kate and Gerry will not be dignifying it with any sort of comment whatsoever.” Related...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:47:02.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
