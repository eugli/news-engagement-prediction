Call it the Herbal Tea Party \nGrassroots activists are studying tactics used by the influential Tea Party in an effort to harden Democrats’ resistance to Donald Trump Mike Stutz, a TV director, says said the left was on a learning curve. ‘We probably got a little complacent during the Obama years.’ Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images View more sharing options Wednesday 1 February 2017 08.00 GMT Last modified on Wednesday 1 February 2017 08.01 GMT \nThey came with chants and songs, banners and flyers and a chicken costume, and felt it was working – that this and other grassroots protests were steeling Democratic resistance to Donald Trump . \n“We need to stand and fight. We are the majority. Let’s take our country back,” Mimi Fleischman told the crowd outside Senator Dianne Feinstein’s Los Angeles office on Tuesday afternoon. \nIt was the latest anti-Trump gathering to target congressional Democrats for perceived pusillanimity towards Trump’s embryonic, whirlwind administration. \nAbout 200 protestors had picketed Feinstein’s house in San Francisco after she had voted for four of the president’s cabinet nominees. Then on Tuesday morning the California senator, the ranking Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee, announced she would oppose the nomination of Jeff Sessions as US attorney general. \n“The pressure is working,” said Daniel Lee, 43, an actor and writer. \nOne rally speaker, Laura Smith, said congressional Democrats should imitate the blanket opposition their Republican colleagues waged against Barack Obama. “I hated that obstructionism but you know what, it frickin’ worked.” \nActivists said they were studying tactics used by the Tea Party, a grassroots movement which yanked the GOP to the right and hardened congressional resistance to Obama. Some have called it the Herbal Tea Party. Rory Carroll (@rorycarroll72) January 31, 2017 \n“As a mobilisation group the Tea Party was very successful. We’ve taken a page from that,” said Viviana Fefferman, 65, a retired insurance worker. \nShe was part of Indivisible of Sherman Oaks, a newly formed group which takes its name from Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda, a 23-page document written by congressional staffers who experienced the Tea Party’s impact. \nSome speakers appropriated the radical right’s claim to represent US values. “Are the flyover states the real America? No. They bought all the fake news. Who says we are not the real America?” said Ginsberg. \nProtestors acknowledged decrying Tea Party tactics when directed against Obama but justified imitation on the grounds Trump was an extreme, perilous aberration. “If John McCain or Mitt Romney was president I’d get behind him,” said Ginsberg. \nSessions may well become attorney general but for those outside Feinstein’s office her opposition still signalled a victory of sorts. And with other nominations for cabinet plus the supreme court looming , followed by an expected blizzard of controversial legislation, the stakes will get only higher. \nFleischman, who organised the rally, said activists needed to stiffen the resolve of their representatives in Washington DC. “People are really fired up. I don’t think there’s any doubt the protests are influencing the Democrats. They can’t hide in their little club anymore.” \nMerle Ginsberg, another speaker, said Feinstein and Kamala Harris, California’s other Democratic senator, had not grasped the intensity of hostility to Trump. “We voted these people in and we can vote them out. They need to listen.” \nSeveral protestors said Harris had shown “a little more backbone” but wanted her to go further. \n“Are we satisfied with the Democrats yet?” asked Pat Thomas, another speaker. \n“No!” shouted back several hundred voices. \nBanners expressed contempt and scorn for the president and his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, an architect of the travel bans. “Time to play hardball.” “No Manchurian president.” “Ban Bannon.” “You don’t need a time machine to fight Nazis.” “Fear is our gross national product.” “Shut it down.” \nThe Herbal Tea partiers are still finding their footing. \nProtest organisers needed to master basics like audio – megaphones and microphones – to make sure people could hear, said one speaker. \nMike Strutz, a TV director who came dressed as a chicken, said the movement was on a learning curve. “We probably got a little complacent during the Obama years. We let some skills slide. At the Women’s March it was like we were getting back into practice. We didn’t have as much of the imagery as we should have.” \nStrutz, who inherited the costume from a TV show, said it was going to be a long fight, he said. “We have to be ready to be on the streets for four years. I think a lot of people will be surprised at how resilient the left will be.” \nHe held a sign saying “Don’t be chicken. Keep fighting back.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:02:38.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
