This is wrong, argues The Grattan Institute. \nThe submission raised issues associated with restrictions on access to the aged pension, including disincentives to avoid the early transfer of assets so retirees still qualify. \nIt also urged actuarial analysis and consultation to consider an appropriate threshold where the value of a primary residence would trigger blocked access the aged pension. \nACCI said four out of five retirees relied on a full or part-time pension and that a similar proportion over 65 owned their own homes, valued at about $1 trillion. \nThe chamber recommended the retirement age be regularly reviewed and gradually lifted to 70 by 2035. \nOther recommendations included reducing government spending to 25 per cent of GDP, cutting the company tax rate to 25 per cent for all businesses over a decade and overhauling workplace relations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T16:32:28.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
