Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA social experiment set up by a YouTube star aimed to see how the people of London would behave if they saw a wad of cash unattended next to a homeless man . \nAnd the results were unexpected to say the least. \nJames Slattery decided to see how the public would react if they spotted £5,000 left next to the sleeping man. \nDressing up as an Arab prince, the notorious YouTube prankster from Ireland - who was responsible for the Honey G stage invasion on the X Factor - opened up a suitcase and took out wads of fake cash. The 'rich' Arab man leaves a wad of cash in full view of the public (Photo: YOUTUBE/ James Slattery) \nHe then left the money next to a 'sleeping' homeless man in several different areas around London. \nFirst, the money was left next to a man in a subway. \nThe homeless man appeared to be sound asleep under several layers of blankets and did not stir as the Arab man placed the money by his head. \nMoments later, two women spotted the cash and immediately headed over the the man.

Everyone in London was honest when confronted with the money (Photo: YOUTUBE/ James Slattery) \nBut the most astounding show of kindness was in the third scenario, when the 'homeless man' was sleeping next to another man also struggling to find shelter. \nInstead of taking the money and making a run for it, the real homeless man woke the actor up to tell him about his unexpected windfall.

We've done three or four different scenarios today. \nA lot of honest people, but nobody homeless honest enough to give it back to me.\" \nThe man replies: \"Yeah honestly, he [the Arab man] said it was for you. He touched your shoulder and left it there.\" \nBaffled, the actor says: \"I can't believe your homeless and you're actually giving it back to me.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:48:58.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
