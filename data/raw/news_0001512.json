Photo: Bloomberg \nHe goads the Chinese; his team is warning Tehran that \"as of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice\"; and he treats Mexico, the US' third biggest trading partner, as a peon. \nThere's a lesson for Turnbull in the responses of other leaders – it's best to put the truth out there. \nSo Merkel issued an early warning that cooperation between Berlin and Washington would depend on genuine respect for shared values; and when she spoke to Trump in the weekend, she lectured him on his obligations to refugees under the Geneva Conventions. \nAnd as Trump made more of a mess last week of his insistence that Mexico will pay for his proposed southern border wall, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto called Trump's bluff, cancelled a meeting that was to take place between the two leaders this week. \nMay, by contrast, tried to \"make nice\", inviting Trump to Britain to meet the Queen and to address the British Parliament – but she went home to a storm of protest, including a petition with closing on 2 million signatures, which demands that she withdraw her invitation for Trump to make a state visit. \nAmerica First is not about alliances so much as deal. So in a matter of days, Washington has gone on a combative footing with Beijing and Tehran, with Trump also suggesting that maybe he'd invade Mexico and even invade Iraq again – making sure this time to commandeer the oil resources. \nTurnbull almost got away with remaining silent on the Trump call – the old diplomatic sensibilities kicked in and the White House at first issued a sanitised account of the phone call – which was the usual \"blah, blah, blah…enduring strength…closeness…critical for world peace…Australia/America loves us\". \nBut if Trump wants to be a bully on the world stage, he needs victims; and a bully is only as good as his reputation – so his victims must be humiliated by the telling of their humiliation, either in a tweet or, as in this case, a background briefing to The Washington Post . \nInfuriating for Turnbull, it didn't have to be Australia. The Trump team could have just as easily slipped the name of any other leader into their account of how tough the new president is. \nThe United Nations is another global institution that commands little or no respect in the Trump White House. And when a European diplomat bravely attempted to impress the importance of the UN on the Trump team at a recent meeting, the response was revealing. \nJason Greenblatt​, formerly Trump's in-house lawyer and now his chief of international negotiations, brushed aside the nonsense of the UN. According to The Washington Post , he told the diplomat: \"we are business people – we're not going to govern this country with diplomatic niceties. We're going to govern it as a business.\" \nMr Turnbull, you have been warned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T11:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:04:35.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
