She told the Detroit TV station WDIV Local 4, the city’s NBC affiliate, that she planned to record an album for release in September before retiring. \n“I must tell you, I am retiring this year,” she told reporter Evrod Cassimy. She said her new album would feature production by Stevie Wonder, and she was “exuberant” about it. However, she said that despite retirement, she wouldn’t be stopping completely.

That wouldn’t be good either.” \nThe new album is to be entirely composed of originals and recorded in Detroit. “I keep my business in Detroit, or as close to Detroit as possible,” she said. \nIn recent years, Franklin – who turns 75 this year – has suffered ill-health. In 2010, she had to cancel shows for medical reasons, and underwent emergency abdominal surgery. Though she denied reports she had pancreatic cancer, she later admitted to having had a tumour removed. Last year, too, she had to cancel shows owing to illness.
