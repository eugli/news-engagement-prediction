It tells the story of the country’s brutal civil war. \nHe had been due to fly to Los Angeles on Turkish airlines, but was refused permission to travel to the US because of “derogatory information” about him. \nSyria was one of the countries named in Donald Trump’s immigration ban. But with the executive order being overturned by the courts, he had expected to be allowed to attend the Oscars. \nThe Department of Homeland Security declined to explain why the cinematographer had been refused entry. \nThe ban comes within weeks of an Iranian film director being refused permission to travel to the US.
