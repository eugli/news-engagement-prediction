(Elaine Thompson / AP) Moriah Balingit, Emma Brown, Sandhya Somashekhar The Washington Post \nThe Trump administration plans to roll back protections for transgender students and is preparing changes to federal guidance that required the nation's public schools to allow students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms that matched their gender identities. \nA White House spokesman said Tuesday that the Education and Justice departments would soon issue new guidance on the matter. He hinted that it would be different from the Obama administration's position, which was that denying transgender students the right to use the bathroom of their choice violates federal prohibitions against sex discrimination. \n\"I think that all you have to do is look at what the president's view has been for a long time, that this is not something that the federal government should be involved in, this is a states' rights issue,\" spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. \nShould the Trump administration reverse the existing transgender guidance, it would be a significant setback for the gay rights movement, which made enormous gains under Obama, winning the right to marry and gaining the ability to serve openly in the military. It suggests that President Trump, who had signaled during the campaign and in the early days of his presidency that he supports gay and transgender rights, will hew closer to the GOP party line. \nThe decision would not have an immediate impact on the nation's public school students because a federal judge had already put a hold on the Obama-era directive issued in May. That directive told schools that students must be permitted to use facilities that corresponded with their gender identity rather than the sex listed on their birth certificates. \nBut it would instantly affect several legal cases, including that of Gavin Grimm, a transgender Virginia teen who sued his school board for barring him from using the boys' bathroom. The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in Grimm's case next month. \nThe Trump administration signaled Friday that it was changing course on the previous administration's efforts to expand transgender rights, submitting a legal brief withdrawing the government's objections to an injunction that had blocked guidance requiring that transgender students be allowed... \nThe Trump administration signaled Friday that it was changing course on the previous administration's efforts to expand transgender rights, submitting a legal brief withdrawing the government's objections to an injunction that had blocked guidance requiring that transgender students be allowed... (Sandhya Somashekhar and Moriah Balingit) \nA lower court ruled in favor of Grimm based on the Obama administration's position on transgender student bathroom use. As a result, the change would at least partially undermine Grimm's case. \nGay rights groups, which expected the Trump administration to change course from the earlier transgender guidance, condemned the move preemptively. \n\"Such clear action directed at children would be a brazen and shameless attack on hundreds of thousands of young Americans who must already defend themselves against schoolyard bullies, but are ill-equipped to fight bullies on the floors of their state legislatures and in the White House,\" Mara Keisling, Executive Director, National Center for Transgender Equality, said in a statement Tuesday. \nThe Obama administration's guidance was based on the position that requiring students to use a restroom that clashes with their gender identity is a violation of Title IX, the federal law that bars sex discrimination in public schools. Transgender students and their parents cheered Obama's move to expand the protections, but it drew legal challenges from those who believe it was a federal intrusion into local affairs and a violation of social norms. \nThe NBA has warned that Texas could be overlooked for future events because of a proposed \"bathroom bill\" targeting transgender people.\nThe Texas legislation is similar to a North Carolina law that prompted the league to move the All-Star Game out of that state.

It would require people to use bathrooms... (Associated Press) \nThe issue of which bathrooms transgender people should be permitted to use has evolved in recent years into a central debate about LGBT rights. Transgender advocates say that allowing people with gender dysphoria to use their preferred restroom is essential for their health and psychological well-being. Opponents say the accommodations violate student privacy and traditional values. \nIt is unusual for a new administration to overturn such significant civil rights guidance, according to advocates who closely track the issue. And such a reversal is likely to leave schools confused about how to proceed, they say; Obama administration officials said that they developed the transgender guidance in response to requests from school officials. \n\"Schools repeatedly asked for guidance on how to support transgender students and create a safe and inclusive learning environment for all,\" said Anurima Bhargava, who helmed the educational opportunities section of DOJ's civil rights division under Obama. \"The guidance has been, and will continue to be, an important and practical resource for schools.\" \nNearly 800 parents of transgender students wrote to President Trump last week, urging him to keep the guidance to protect their children from discrimination. \n\"No young person should wake up in the morning fearful of the school day ahead,\" the parents wrote. \"When this guidance was issued last year, it provided our families - and other families like our own across the country - with the knowledge and security that our government was determined to protect our children from bullying and discrimination. Please do not take that away from us.\" \nThe Obama administration's directive sparked immediate backlash when it was issued last May from those who saw it as a gross overreach of executive power, and several states sued in response. \nTexas Lt. Gov Dan Patrick has been one of the most vociferous opponents of the Obama guidance, calling it \"blackmail\" and the most important issue for families in schools since the Supreme Court ruled against school-sponsored prayer. \nIn January, Patrick joined Texas Republicans in supporting a bill that would require the state's transgender residents to use bathrooms and locker rooms corresponding to their biological sex, not their gender identity. He said the legislation was necessary to protect Texans' privacy, including in public schools. \n\"We know it's going to be a tough fight,\" Patrick said at the time, according to the Texas Tribune. \"But we know we're on the right side of the issue. We're on the right side of history. You can mark today as the day Texas is drawing a line in the sand and saying no.\" \nIn an interview in May with The Washington Post, Donald Trump, then the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, said that he thought the government should protect transgender people but that he would rescind guidance issued by the Obama administration directing schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. Trump said that should be left up to the states. \n\"I think it's something where we have to help people - and hopefully the states will make the right decisions,\" Trump said in the interview. \nReversing the guidance would put Betsy DeVos - who was narrowly confirmed as secretary of the Education Department after a contentious hearing last month - in the middle of an equally contentious issue at the outset of her tenure. \nDeVos has been accused of hostility to LGBT rights because of her extended family's donations to socially conservative advocacy groups and efforts to ban same-sex marriage. She has tried to distance herself from her family's position; in 2004, for example, she and her husband did not contribute to a ballot initiative to ban same-sex marriage in their home state of Michigan, though several of their relatives did. \nAt her confirmation hearing, she asked senators not to confuse her record with that of her family: \"I embrace equality, and I firmly believe in the intrinsic value of each individual, and that every student should have the assurance of a safe and discrimination-free place to become educated,\" she said at the time. And a week later, a spokesman for the DeVos family told Buzzfeed News that DeVos supports same-sex marriage. \nBut she never said she was committed to upholding the Obama administration's guidance on transgender students, writing in response to a question from Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) that she would \"carefully review the law and all existing documents that are in effect on Title IX to ensure that the Department is faithfully implementing the law as intended.\" \nThe Washington Post's Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:50:40.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
