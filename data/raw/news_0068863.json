It has long been the holy grail of the fossil fuel industry, but now \"clean coal\", including carbon capture and storage technology, may soon be a reality. \nProfessor Haszeldine said the first challenge for many governments was financing the technology. \n\"The science and technology and engineering is all there but it always falls over at the financing model because countries find that introducing carbon capture and storage in competition with low-cost renewables is very difficult financially,\" he said. \nProfessor Haszeldine said CCS had been successfully used in many parts of the world, and Australia should consider using it. \n\"[Australia] has to safeguard its own energy security and part of that is being able to use low-cost fossil fuel with the ability to capture carbon wrapped in part of the package,\" he said. \nBut many in the environmental lobby are sceptical about CCS and argue it works only in theory and that it is too expensive and unreliable. \nJohn Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute, said the path to lowering emissions was renewable technology. \n\"If we're serious about this we need some fair dinkum policies and other support but we have to do that in the context of a national plan,\" he said. \n\"I'd prefer Australia being a world leader in responsible action in climate action and that's getting the net zero emissions before 2050 [and that] means phasing out our current stack of coal-fired power stations. \n\"Carbon capture and storage is going to be important but probably more important actually is helping take carbon out of the atmosphere where it's already at dangerous levels.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:40:25.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
