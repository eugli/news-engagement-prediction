Photo: Bureau of Meteorology \nSydney's west recorded its hottest ever day, hitting 46.9 degrees at Penrith, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, eclipsing its previous hottest of 46.5 degrees in January 2013, while Richmond touched the 47 degree mark. \nOn the coast, Saturday's top of 36.1 degrees made it a record 11th day above 35 in Sydney this summer, while in the state's west, the small township of Ivanhoe, population 200, reached a stifling maximum of 47.6 degrees; the second hottest recorded February temperature ever recorded in NSW. \nOn Saturday morning, White Cliffs broke the 102-year-old record for highest minimum in NSW, 34.2 degrees at 7am. \nDeputy Commissioner Rob Rogers offered a blunt message to those considering visiting fire-prone areas: don't go. \n\"Go to the beach instead, do something else, particularly those people who may be thinking about camping. Plan it for another time,\" he said. \nNSW Emergency Services Minister Troy Grant echoed Commissioner Rogers concerns. \n\"Where you can, please seek refuge,\" he said. \nCommissioner Rogers said firefighters were expecting a particularly tough five-hour period on Sunday, before a southerly change swept through on Sunday evening and into Monday morning. \nFor Sydneysiders little relief is in sight over the next week, with three days now forecast to hit the 30s.
