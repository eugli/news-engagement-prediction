It would give the government grounds to prosecute anyone at a riotunder racketeering charges,even if he or she doesn'tcause anyone personal harm or property damage. By lumping rioting in with racketeering chargesusually aimed at cracking down onorganized crimeit also means police officers would have the ability toarrest people planning a protest, the Capitol Times points out.\nRepublican statesenatorJohn Kavanaghargued that the law was necessary to crack down on the \"full-time, almost professional agent-provocateurs that attempt to create public disorder,\" echoing the Trump administration's recent rhetoric about \"liberal activists\" who they believeare being paid to protest at Republican congressmen's town halls. \n\"Wouldn't you rather stop a riot before it starts?\"Kavanagh, a former police officer, said during the state senate debate.\"Do you really want to wait until people are injuring each other, throwing Molotov cocktails, picking up barricades, and smashing them through businesses in downtown Phoenix?\"\nDemocrats, on the other hand, pointed out that rioting is already a crime, andindividuals who cause property damage and commitassault during protests could easily be prosecuted individually. They argued thebill could infringe on free-speech rights and deter anyone from trying to protest peacefully against the government.\n\"This idea that people are being paid to come out and do that?\" Democratic senatorKatie Hobbs said.\"I'm sorry, but I think that is fake news.\"\nSteve Farley, another state senator,said he didn't think the law would hold up in court.\"This is a total perversion of the RICO process, the racketeering process, and I see major constitutional issues down the line,\" he said. \"I don't think this is going to do anything but get us into more lawsuits.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:15:31.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
