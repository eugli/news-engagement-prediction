Since its launch in December, more than $121,000 has been raised.\nThis meant the veteran could stay in his home for another seven months.\n“His front porch is a special place,” Volma Overton, 68,” told ABC News. “He always sits there and waves to people and everyone just comes by and talks to him.”\nHis wife, Shirley Overton, described the elder Overton as “very witty.”\n“We wanted him to be able to stay where he knows and loves,” she said. “He still walks and talks and does everything. He’s so much fun to be around.”\nOverton, who was born in Bastrop County in 1906, served in the Pacific Theater from 1942 to 1945 as part of the all-black 1887th Engineer Aviation Battalion. After the war, he returned to Austin, and he has lived in the same home ever since.\nHis 111th birthday is in May.\nVolma Overton said the money raised was used to hire an in-home senior care provider. He estimates one year of coverage will cost around $180,000.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxnews.com/", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmsEZv?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;102&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmsEZv?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6Dp75.img", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmsEZv&lang=en-us&flow_id=abe9262e-e3f4-488e-b9fb-4c2330276dd3", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmsEZv%3focid%3dst&text=More+than+%24121G+raised+for+110-year-old+World+War+II+vet+to+stay+at+home&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmsEZv%3focid%3dst", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmssJi.img&quot;}}", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmsEZv%3focid%3dsl&title=More+than+%24121G+raised+for+110-year-old+World+War+II+vet+to+stay+at+home&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmsEZv%3focid%3dsl", "https://www.gofundme.com/Help-Richard-Overton", "http://media2.foxnews.com/120114/120114_rs_veteran_FNC_HIGH.mp4&quot;,&quot;shareUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/31/more-than-121g-raised-for-110-year-old-world-war-ii-vet-to-stay-at-home.html?cmpid=prn_msn&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;FOX", "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/oldest-american-wwii-vet-celebrates-110th-birthday-with-cigar.html", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmsEZv?blobrefkey=101&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;180&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA3e1oO.img", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/73e53b76-1b3a-477b-b68f-f52228369997/03aa07f0-1ad1-4528-8582-b1de4e23497e.ism&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1006&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/73e53b76-1b3a-477b-b68f-f52228369997/03aa07f0-1ad1-4528-8582-b1de4e23497e.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;htt", "http://api.foxnews.com/v1/custom/partner/msn/section/us&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerName&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/110-year-world-war-ii-veteran-stay-home/story?id=45063399"], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:06:20.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
