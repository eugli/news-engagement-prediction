Nuvo Logistics, last year shut down its heavily funded hyperlocal delivery business Peppertap following an inability to attain a positive unit economics Post Your Comments Priyanka Sahay Moneycontrol.com Nuvo Logistics, which runs reverse logistics firm Nuvo Ex, has acqui-hired a Bengaluru-based logistics start-up Paketts, according to two people privy to the development. The size of the deal couldn't be ascertained. Paketts was founded by Chandan Joshi and Abhishek Dubey in May 2015. While Joshi was an associate trader at Credit Suisse, Dubey was a senior manager at Flipkart before starting this venture, according to their Linkedin profiles. A team of around 60 people from Paketts are joining Nuvo following this deal, one of the persons quoted above said requesting anonymity. Nuvo Logistics last year shut down its hyperlocal delivery business Peppertap following a funding slowdown and inability to attain a positive unit economics in Paketts. It essentially takes care of intracity, last-mile deliveries for e-commerce companies. It operates across seven cities including Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Jaipur and Lucknow, among others. Last mile delivery is something very different from what Nuvo is currently doing. While last mile involves transportation of goods from a transportation hub to the end consumers, in reverse logistics the goods are picked up from consumers and taken back to the hub.Since the last two months, Nuvo has also started doing first mile delivery where it picks up products from the merchants, said a third person privy to the development requesting anonymity.It isn't immediately clear if the reverse logistics firm is considering to offer a 360 degree package of delivery services. In such a scenario it will lock horns with specialty logistics firm Delhivery and Ecom Express besides conventional logistics firms including DHL Express and Bluedart. Nuvo Logistics and Paketts did not respond to emails.The Indian e-commerce market is expected to overtake the US becoming the second largest in the world following China, according to a recent report by global payments firm Worldpay. It will fuel the growth of supply chain and thus will give a boost to the overall logistics sector. Buy , Hold , Sell ?
