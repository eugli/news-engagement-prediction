Also, if you use any of your stones as healing tools they should be cleaned before and after each healing session. Healers will dedicate or program crystals to increase or enhance their vibrational energies. The programming also helps protect the stones themselves from absorbing any harmful energies while they are in service. \nThere are many different ways to clean your gemstones. Choosing the best cleaning method depends on the type of stone you are wanting to clean. An hour in direct sunlight is more than enough to clean most stones. However, certain stones will fade if left out in the sunlight, amethyst is one example. Keep your amethysts out of direct sunlight if you want them to retain their vibrant purple hues. Moonlight cleansing can take several hours or days. To expose a stone to all the moon phases ( full moon to new moon ) place the stone outside each evening at dusk (retrieving it before sunrise) for 28 consecutive days. \nSome stones will dissolve in water, whereas others love to be soaked in fresh water. I actually clean most of my stones under a running tap of cold water while brushing them with a soft-bristle toothbrush until they are sparkling clean. It is simple to do and no fuzz. My stones are perfectly happy to be shined up from the same water source that I take my showers in. Rub-a-dub-dub!
