(Bitton celebrates his league goal by gesturing a heart) \nThe Facebook page 'Keep Jasmin Smiling' posted an update yesterday showing pictures of Bitton handing over the shirt, as well as an envelope of cash containing the instruction: 'Hope you enjoy Disneyland'. :camera_with_flash: ' Brilliant from Nir Bitton :clap: pic.twitter.com/ewNoDdVTIQ - Read Celtic (@ReadCeltic) February 26, 2017 \nJasmin's Facebook page simply states that Jasmin is dealing with the effects of a brain tumour and the page's aim is to keep her smiling. \nThe most recent post details how Jasmin failed to make it to Celtic Park for the Hoops' 2-0 win over Hamilton yesterday but hopefully Bitton's surprise present helps to put a smile on her face. \nFair play, Nir. Brilliant gesture! \nThis story was first featured on talkingbaws.com - simple, shareable sport. Like them on Facebook and follow them on Twitter.
