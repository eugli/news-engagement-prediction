And as June Brown turns 90, she remains the backbone of the soap that made her famous 32 years ago. Her character has survived everything EastEnders has thrown at her, including endless shifts in the launderette, the death of her beloved son Nick and kidney cancer. Scandals keep on spinning around her, and while her eyesight is failing her strength, humour and (sometimes unwanted) advice never does. ‘I ain’t one to gossip’ … Dot Cotton. Photograph: BBC \nAny soap conversation that starts with “I ain’t one to gossip” is a juicy one – especially when those words are uttered by Dot. She’s judgmental to all, a confidante to those in trouble and a friend to the younger generation. In a time when teenagers drink cocktails out of jam jars and mourners brandish glowsticks at funerals, Dot remains reassuringly serene, upstanding and an unwavering beacon of traditional – often controversial – values. \nBrown was 58 when Dot first appeared in Walford and she set out her stall early as a hypochondriac who always seemed to have “one of her heads coming on”. When teenage Michelle Fowler became pregnant, Dot wasted no time voicing her concerns about the moral decay going on around her. Not that she was squeaky clean. Her first husband, Charlie, was a conman and an adulterer. Other than God, the biggest love of her life was her son, uber-villain Nasty Nick. Their relationship was beautifully played each time the scheming heroin addict turned up with a gravelly “Hello Maaaa.” He was evil enough to try to poison her with a candlelit dinner so he could steal all her cash, but Dot loved him fiercely until his final, fatal dose. She decided not to call an ambulance and was sentenced to 14 months for manslaughter. \nBy her own admission, Dot is a “miserable old bag, quoting from the Bible”. When her old friend Colin turned up to invite her to his wedding, she declined with a refusal to condone gay marriage. Back in the 80s, she unleashed a shocking homophobic rant against him and his boyfriend Barry. “I couldn’t clean your flat because that would be tantamount to condoning it,” she said. “Not to mention that the pair of you might well have Aids.” But when her friend Ethel wanted to end her life, Dot parked her Christian beliefs to help her. ‘Hello Maaaa’ … Dot with her beloved son Nick. Photograph: BBC \nAlthough her life hasn’t been easy, Dot’s eyes had a special twinkle during her relationship with gargoyle-faced lothario Jim Branning, who proposed on the London Eye. She was coquettish and sexy in fur on her wedding day . Like Coronation Street’s Jack and Vera Duckworth, Dot and Jim’s relationship thrived on constant bickering, but her love was tested when her husband had a stroke. Brown’s famous “one-hander” episode saw her recording a message for Jim, telling him why she couldn’t care for him. “I ain’t got no strength left … I’m better on me own, where I’ve always been,” she said. The reflective scene earned her a Bafta nomination . It summed up a life of loss and disappointment from a woman who couldn’t take any more.

She’s never more alive than at a funeral, which gives her a chance to bring out her best clothes and red lippy, coiff that quiff and offer support to others. Apart from her health problems, which have always been there, her character is ageless. She can dish out advice to youngsters and likes to surround herself with their energy. The late Fatboy lodged with her and broadened her mind, not least when he opened her eyes to the phrase “sket”. “ What, you mean like Pat Butcher in the 80s? ” she retorted. \nIt’s rare to see such a strong but beleaguered soap character survive to old age and, with Lou Beale, Ethel Skinner and Peggy Mitchell all gone, Dot is the last matriarch standing. Long may she gossip. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:30:58.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
