Kate Shuttleworth, Amanda Saxton, Lucy Swinnen and Emily Spink report. \nIRAQ \n\nFaisal Halabi was born in Iraq, but came to NZ when he was five, and is now a lawyer in Auckland. CHRIS MCKEEN/FAIRFAX NZ \nFaisal Halabi turned 5 while he was travelling on planes between Baghdad and Auckland. \n\"I was smack bang ready for primary school,\" says the suited solicitor pulling together fragments of his early memories. \nWhen he arrived in New Zealand 21 years ago Halabi didn't speak any English. \nHis father Bassam, who spoke broken English, taught him one word - \"pass\" - always to be used in response to questions in class. \n\"I remember saying that word for the longest time and people just giving me a funny look.\" \nHis family left Iraq in 1996 to find a better way of life, not as refugees but as immigrants. His parents, both qualified engineers, wanted their children to have greater opportunities and access to education. \nThey arrived at Auckland International Airport with just a few bags of clothing, photograph albums, but with little spoken English and knowing no one. \nMoving into a state house on iconic Dominion Road near Balmoral, the Halabis only had mattresses to sleep on, he says. \nTheir young Kiwi neighbours with two daughters helped to make their introduction to New Zealand smooth. \n\"We were invited to play on their trampoline, we went to the movies, rode on bikes and went to school together. \n\"They transformed our experience, it was so welcoming.\" \nHalabi is not sure immigrants and refugees have the same experience today and wonders if Aucklanders are as open to diversity as when he arrived. \n\"If a family were to fly into New Zealand tomorrow and their first interaction was with a closed off anti-immigrant group of people what would that mean for that family?\" \nThe Trump ban compounds things, says Halabi, who still has some family members in tumultuous Mosul. \n\"It's a double injustice when people come from such hardships and then arrive to be treated as 'other'.\" \nSOUTH SUDAN \nSouth Sudanese refugee Gatluak Chuol sits in the office where he supports other recent arrivees in the country. CHRIS MCKEEN/FAIRFAX NZ \nBorn by the White Nile 45 years ago, Gatluak Chuol​ spent his childhood in a nation that didn't exist until 2011. He has a US passport that states he is from Sudan. \nBut Chuol is South Sudanese and is trying to get New Zealand residency for the sake of his four kids. \nHe came here two years ago and works to resettle refugees. \nAs a teenager, Chuol fled the war between Sudan's Muslim north and what is now an independent Christian south. \n\"One morning I woke and the bombs were being dropped in our village, killing nearly everyone.\" \n\"I was searching for my family but in the end joined the rest of the boys and we found ourselves on the Ethiopian border.\" \nAll he knew at the time was that the fighting \"had something to do with religion.\" \nHe walked for three months, dodging bomb-bearing planes during the day and lions at night, before arriving at a refugee camp. \nAfter two decades in camps, first in Ethiopia and then in Kenya where he met his wife, America accepted Chuol as a refugee. \nHis wife Lilian and their children were sent to New Zealand. \nChuol said the patience learned by all refugees helped him cope with that \"very hard\" separation. \n\"I knew that I had to wait to become a US citizen before I could come here.\" \nThe couple reunited in New Zealand because they believed it was the better place for their severely autistic son. \n\"He would not have access to as good health care in the US,\" Chuol says. \n\"Also, my wife had really appreciated being accepted as a solo mum. She had told me a lot about the diversity in New Zealand and the cooperation between people.\" \nChoul worried about his family in the US, without US citizenship, who were still documented as Sudanese. \n\"We just don't know what will happen for them, who will be deported and who won't be,\" he says. \nIn Auckland, Chuol noted that North and South Sudanese were united by basketball, dominoes, and food from their countries. \n\"We say that these people - New Zealanders - they welcomed us. So why should we bring conflict?\" \n﻿ SOMALIA \nPHOTO: DOMINICO ZAPATA/FAIRFAX NZ \nFarhan Osman moved to New Zealand from Somalia 15 years ago and now calls himself a Kiwi but he's not sure Trump would agree. \nThe 34 year old and his wife are raising their four young children in Hamilton. \nHe says Kiwi life is relatively stress-free compared to Africa. \n\"I love New Zealand, it's a very peaceful country. \n\"Life is easier here - you get in the car, go to work then come home, spend time with friends then go to the mosque.\" \nOsman was 19 when he arrived, after he'd spent five years in a refugee camp. \nHe still has vivid memories of Somalia. \nIt's also a beautiful country, he says. \n\"My father used to take me to the beach.\" \nBut those memories are also intertwined with the dangers of living there - the fighting and having to flee his house. \nHe remembers the first time he saw a dead body. \n\"I saw people I knew killed in front of me. It was hard to see someone you know alive and speaking five minutes ago, now lying dead - it's horrible.\" \nOsman went to secondary school when he arrived in New Zealand, then university and now he works for the Ministry of Social Development. \nTrump's ban confuses him. \n\"Imagine, for example, if Australia said they were banning New Zealanders from visiting.\" \n\"What if Australia lumped us all as one and banned everyone, because of a few,\" he adds. \nIt's not fair on the 12 million Somalis worldwide, he says. \n\"We are global people I have a friend in Australia, a cousin in the UK, a friend in Kenya and relative in the US.\" \nOsman does have New Zealand citizenship, but is still unsure if he can enter America. \nSYRIAN AND IRANIAN COUPLE Syrian man Karam Shaar and his Iranian wife Hanna Habibi - Karam says he can't see his father in the US because of Trump's travel ban. CAMERON BURNELL/FAIRFAX NZ. Karam Shaar, 29, has finally started to build a new life with his wife Hanna Habibi, 31, in New Zealand. \nThe Syrian civil war threw his life into chaos, and led to years of uncertainty and separation from his family that continue even as he starts life anew in New Zealand. \nHe'd planned to visit his father in the US for the first time since the war broke out in 2012, but says the travel ban prevents any reunion. \nBorn in Aleppo, Shaar says he's always had plans to study abroad, but when protests broke out against Bashar al-Assad's regime things escalated quickly. \nWhat started out peaceful, turned into his friends getting threatened and arrested, he says from his living room in the Wellington suburb of Karori \nHe wanted to leave by choice to go and study. Instead, he was forced flee by necessity. \nHe fled to Malaysia with no plan, ending up studying towards a masters in economics, he lived with the uncertainty not knowing where he could settle permanently. \nHe applied for, and was accepted to study in either Italy or New Zealand and receive a full scholarship - he picked New Zealand. \nIt was six months before he was able to secure a student visa to study here. \nWhile he was in Malaysia at university he met his wife Hanna, who is from Iran. \nHanna is also enrolled in a PhD in Economics, she arrived in Wellington in April, 2016. \nShaar was granted asylum in New Zealand and the couple have just applied for permanent residence. \n\"My experience has been very lovely, truth be told,\" he says. \n\"People have been super supportive.\" \nDespite facing financial pressures the couple wouldn't be anywhere else. \n\"I would call it home,\" he adds. \nHe does miss the warmth and community in Syria and says, New Zealanders can be very individualistic. \nHis main sadness is his separation from his family. \n\"I miss my dad - I would love to see him.\" \nThe last time he saw his Mother and siblings were at his wedding in Turkey in 2015. \nHis father was unable to leave the US to come to attend. \nShaar had plans to see his father this year, but with the stroke of a pen, Trump has thrown their reunion up in the air. \n\"It's very ambiguous,\" he says. \n\"We don't quite know if he's impacted.\" \n\"There is no solution but to wait.\" \nIRAN Reza Zarnekabi, originally from Iran, works in Christchurch as a Environmental Planner and Manager. GEORGE HEARD/FAIRFAX NZ Reza Zarnekabi​ never intended to stay in New Zealand for long. \nHe ended up falling in love with the Kiwi way of life. \nFive years-ago, Zarnekabi and his wife Leila, moved from Iran to Christchurch, enrolling in a PhD programme at Lincoln University. \nJust two years into his PhD in environmental economics, he decided to quit. \n\"We talked together and decided it would be a good idea to stay here a little bit more, and find a job and have an experience here.\" \nHe then took up a job with an engineering consultancy company. \n\"I enjoy working for a diverse company like Aurecon, who respect all cultures and ethnicities.\" \nLeila works part time as a research assistant for the Bio Protection Research Centre, while she completes her masters in water resources management. \nReza and Leila say they enjoy travelling around New Zealand camping, cycling or going on climbing adventures. \nHe adds, that New Zealand society is more developed than Iran - \"not in a structural or physical sense, but mentally\". \n\"Most people are very open-minded and can tolerate each other.\" \nReza has a permanent residency visa and says he is among those \"indirectly\" affected by Trump's travel ban. \nWhile he had no plans to travel to the US, he disagreed with the order. \n\"Personally, I'm upset about this order. For me, banning people from travelling or living in a country based on their nationality or religion is a kind of discrimination. I know it affected a lot of people's plans and lives.\" \n\"I hope this policy will be a temporary policy and changed soon.\" \nYEMEN \n﻿ Arwa Ziad, 36, is a Yemeni citizen is unsure if she can travel under the US travel ban. She holds a passport from Yemen. MAARTEN HOLL/FAIRFAX NZ \nYemeni woman Arwa Ziad loves the outdoors and says New Zealand was the perfect pick for her and her young family. \nShe moved to New Zealand with her British husband and two young sons five years ago, she holds a Yemini passport - her mother is Lebanese and her father is Yemeni. \nZiad's cosmopolitan upbringing took her took her to Yemen, Lebanon, France, and the United Arab Emirates. \n\"I remember the kind genuine people,\" she says and hiking the rocky mountains of Yemen. \nNow New Zealand is home. \n\"I have a great life here. My boys love cycling around the Hutt River trail. But I've never gotten used to the wind.\" \nShe volunteers with refugees at the Red Cross, teaching dance and founded the Hutt Valley Newcomers network to help others adapting to their new home. \nThe news of the travel ban, including Yemini people has left her frustrated. \nHer first thought was \"what can I do to help?\" \nHaving only a Yemeni passport, but permanent residence in New Zealand, developments overseas make her hope she will gain New Zealand citizenship as soon as possible. \nIt was already difficult to travel on a Yemeni passport, now it's worse, she says. \n\"Being a Yemeni passport holder, I'm considered a terrorist.\" \nHer sister who lives in Dubai and has a Yemeni passport was denied a visa to visit her in New Zealand two years ago, she says. \n\"The whole thing is very silly.\" \n\"It is nice to think positive and maybe things can change, but I have a feeling things will only get worse.\" \nLibya \nBaha Mabruk, a dual citizen of New Zealand a Libya, still has siblings living in Libya and is concerned for all affected by the US travel ban. CAMERON BURNELL/FAIRFAX NZ. \nBaha Mabruk calls New Zealand home, he's been here for 20 years. \nThe real estate agent and his wife Maysoon, who works in a medical lab, have made a good life in New Zealand, he says. \n\"I love my life, I love the culture - I created a family I didn't have.\" \nHe does miss the sunny outlook of Libyan people and the weather. \nA dual citizen, he still has siblings living in Libya and is concerned for all those affected by the ban. \nThe ban will target the most vulnerable and inject \"a little bit of hate, a little bit of isolation\" into the world, he says. \n\"Our people are a little bit vulnerable. Some people are so scared, terrified.\" \nInitially, Mabruk thought Trump would be good for the US - that he might address rising inequality in the country and use his business acumen to make gains for the country. \nNot anymore. \nHe has travelled to the US before and would love to spend Christmas in New York but is not so sure now. \n\"Life is beautiful, why do we have to be banned?\" he asks. \n\"As muslims we have to be defensive all the time.\" \nIt would be good for New Zealand to raise its' voice on the world stage in support of all those affected. \n\"New Zealand is a role model to the Western world.\" \nHe said there was little he can do but make light of the \"childish\" ban, however he says it will have serious consequences. - Sunday Star Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:56:06.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
