We will take the number of stores to 25 and these will be across the top cities in the country,\" Myntra CEO Ananth Narayanan said. \n\nHe added that the company expects to help grow Mango's India business 3X over the next 5 years. \n\n\"Right now, Mango has about 20 per cent of its global product portfolio in India. This partnership will help Mango bring 100 per cent of its product lines -- including men's and kids wear to the Indian market,\" he said. \n\nMango has a network of 2,200 stores in 110 countries. The company, which owns the MANGO Woman, Man, Kids and Violeta (plus size) lines, closed 2015 with sales of 2.3 billion euros, up 15 per cent from the previous year. \n\nIt had entered the Indian market in September 2001.
