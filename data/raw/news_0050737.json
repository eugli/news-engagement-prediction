He has concluded that a bottle deposit scheme would save councils millions of pounds in waste collection. At the same time, tons of plastic which would otherwise go into landfill sites could be collected and reused. Countries that already operate successful DRS schemes include Germany and Sweden, where plastic bottle collection is over 85 per cent – compared with less than 60 per cent in the UK, where recycling rates have stalled. Tories in Westminster, particularly the then-chancellor George Osborne (pictured), were also reluctant to support the 5p charge on plastic bags introduced in October 2015 – but ministers now hail it as a great success Every day, more than 15million plastic bottles in the UK are dumped after a single use rather than being collected and recycled. Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom is working on a new anti-litter strategy amid concerns about the blight caused by plastic bottles and cans. Last week, Whitehall insiders suggested ministers are sceptical about a bottle deposit scheme in England. This follows heavy lobbying from drinks firms and industry trade bodies. Tories in Westminster, particularly the then-chancellor George Osborne, were also reluctant to support the 5p charge on plastic bags introduced in October 2015 – but ministers now hail it as a great success. Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom is working on a new anti-litter strategy amid concerns about the blight caused by plastic bottles and cans Many local councils oppose a bottle deposit scheme, partly because it would affect their income as they would collect fewer plastic bottles and drinks cans to sell on. Suez insists councils will save money. Mr Palmer-Jones said: ‘The country has already made huge leaps in the past decade, shifting from a throw-away society to a culture of reuse and recycling, but we can’t waste an opportunity to make further improvements,. ‘At the moment, Government seems to be quick to rule out the introduction of various schemes such as this, but we have yet to see much in the way of positive alternative direction from them in addressing the problems we face with both flat-lining recycling rates and litter.’ Soft drinks firms have lobbied against DRS, amid concerns it will hit their profits. Other critics say there is no evidence such a scheme would reduce litter.
