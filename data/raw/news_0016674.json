He has done that with Seattle's Pete Carroll , Indianapolis' Chuck Pagano and the Ravens' John Harbaugh. Each week he finds a way to take out the other team's top offensive player or comes up with something new like the quick-paced, no-huddle offense that caught Pittsburgh off guard in the AFC championship two weeks ago. \nOn Sunday, the Patriots had two excellent two-point conversion plays, and even that final play at the end of regulation where they ran a sweep was neat. The Patriots are so disciplined that they very seldom beat themselves like Atlanta did by trying to return kickoffs five yards deep in the end zone late in the game. \nThe Patriots' opponents fear Belichick because of the enormous respect they have for him. It was fun watching him Sunday night. As the Patriots were getting smacked around in the first half he was on the sidelines either fussing with his players or cursing officials. He was walking around with photos of formations, talking with and teaching his players, not leaving it up to the position coaches. \nBy the third quarter, he had improved the scheme as far as protecting Brady and the Patriots started winning individual matchups. Meanwhile, Atlanta made no adjustments defensively and allowed those Smurf-like Patriots receivers to escape clean off the line of scrimmage. \nIn the end, the Falcons got tired on defense. Brady roasted them for 466 yards and two touchdowns as he completed 43 of 62 passes to win his fourth Super Bowl MVP. He is hated in Baltimore — and that is understandable — but he is an amazing player. \nLocal fans complain about his whining, but on Sunday night he took a beating in the first half and was tough enough to lead his team to one of the greatest comebacks in league history. \nAt his age, you have to wonder how much longer Brady can perform at such a high level. Few athletes, much less quarterbacks, have lasted as long. Some of his passes lack the zip from years ago, but he still has that touch, and mentally he appears as sharp as ever. The only teams that have had consistent success against Brady are the ones with physical defenses, such as Seattle and Denver, but the NFL is taking the physical style out of the game. The emphasis and rules favor the offense. \nWhen wide receivers Danny Amendola and Julian Edelman dropped passes in the game, Brady looked to rookie wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell and running back James White. It's like the offense is a machine and Brady runs it without ever missing a beat. \nAs the Patriots narrowed the Falcons' lead to 16 points with about 6 minutes left in the game I thought New England was going to win. I had read this script before and seen the play. Some of the actors had changed, but the lead guys were still Belichick and Brady. \nI never thought about the final score. I just kept asking myself if these guys were ever going to retire? \ntwitter.com/MikePrestonSun", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:18:15.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
