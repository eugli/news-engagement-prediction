SUPPLIED \nGoogle has been a pioneer in designing lively, open-space offices that encourage collaboration. \nThe building they have to transform is the former Takapuna RSA on Mary Poynton Cres, which is now nothing more than an empty frame. \nREAD MORE: \nThe lease for the space was awarded to the Yes Disability Trust by the Devonport-Takapuna Local Board in June last year, and designs for the two-storey building have been growing quickly. TOM DILLANE/FAIRFAX NZ \nGrand plans, and strong ambition, are required to turn the old Takapuna RSA building into a Google-esque modern lounge office space. \n\"There's not a decision made by anybody at any time on the centre that isn't equally made by the young people,\" Yes Disability resource centre chief executive Sonia Thursby said. \n\"That's a major shift for some of our smart, older people on the North Shore. There's been 15 years' research into needing a space like this on the North Shore. So it's not like it's a new idea. \n\"When you walk through the door, this place should be able to support you and accelerate you to whatever you dream.\" \nOverseeing the design of the centre is a steering committee made up of Thursby and other members of Yes Disability Trust, three members of the Takapuna youth local board called YOUNITE, and Sian Simpson - a consultant from tech start-up company Kiwi Landing Pad. Ad Feedback \nAside from being a central hub for nearby schools, Sian Simpson views the centre as an ideal location for young people, from 14 upwards, to make connections with nearby industry. \n\"Across the road from the centre you have Smales Farm, Vodafone is moving in there, TNZ [Tourism New Zealand] is moving in there, Air New Zealand is coming on board. So we're kind of on the cusp of a business park that's going to be 'destination North Shore',\" Simpson said. \n\"We don't realise what we're sitting on. The North Shore hasn't ever really had a space to go. I grew up on the Shore and we just used to gather at this roundabout in Browns Bay, and I'm 25 now.\" \nWhile the steering committee fully agree the youth centre should be a place where young people can come to just relax and socialise, YOUNITE member Ian Lim says it can also be a facility for young people to pursue their creative and business ambitions. \n\"We think the young people of the North Shore have incredible ambition and the problem is, in some areas, this potential isn't being realised because the services and programmes aren't out there to provide for that need.\" \n\"We're trying to to provide alternative career development pathways and show people what's possible in the real world outside of just taking the traditional route of going to university, studying a BCom or something along those lines.\" \nThe first architect's draft for the youth centre includes a recording studio, lecture theatre, computer and engineering labs, art room, exercise space, library, drama studio, and large sections of study space and lounge areas. \nUnsurprisingly, all these facilities come with a large price tag and the Yes Disability Trust is hoping to raise $3.5 million to 4.5 million of donations to help construct it. \nDespite this financial hurdle, the Junction steering committee is optimistic the centre will open in some capacity in the second half of 2017. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:44:10.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
