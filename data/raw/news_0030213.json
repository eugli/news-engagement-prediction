Just don’t expect them to be honored to the tune of “Hallelujah.” by Twitter From The LIFE Picture Collection. In 2003, Bruce Springsteen, Steven Van Zandt, Elvis Costello, and Dave Grohl made Grammys history. Backed by No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal and longtime Elvis Costello drummer Pete Thomas, the musicians united onstage to perform the Recording Academy awards gala’s first tribute. To honor Joe Strummer, the group ripped through The Clash’s “London Calling.” It was a performance to remember—and kicked off just one another tradition the Academy uses to honor artists who have died each year. Now, after a year during which seemingly countless major artists passed away, Vanity Fair spoke with Grammys executive producer Ken Ehrlich about how the Academy recognizes its late icons—both through tribute performances, and through its “In Memoriam” montage. To Ehrlich, the process is more art than science. Artists who receive individual tributes—this year, Prince and George Michael—tend to be those who had an exceptional level of influence on music during their lives. And although it’s important to recognize the greats, Ehrlich noted that the night is also an occasion to celebrate all of the exciting things that have happened within the music industry each year—so it’s also crucial to maintain a balance, and make sure not to spend too much time looking to the past. As a result, personal connections to particular artists must give way to a more objective perspective: who really changed music during their careers? As for the show’s In Memoriam montage, Ehrlich said the research stage takes far longer than actually putting together the video itself. Out of the hundreds of artists and industry professionals who may have passed away, only about 50 can make it into the montage itself—and each can only be displayed onscreen for a few seconds. Who makes it in is decided by a committee of about 12 or 13 people from the recording academy, just one more way that the ceremony tries to make the system democratic and objective—and driven primarily by musical influence. “There are people that I would put in there, but it’s not about me,” Ehrlich told the A.P. . “It’s about the music industry as a whole and all of its parts: classical and rock and pop and Latin and jazz. So it’s a difficult process.” Usually, the montage will include snippets of fallen stars performing a hook from one of their most memorable songs—but using that approach for every artist would yield a very choppy video, so some artists get grouped together over one song. All told, Ehrlich said the editing process takes around 10 days. As of Thursday night, he noted that the montage for Sunday’s ceremony was roughly 90 percent finished. But don’t expect to hear Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”: Ehrlich said it would feel too on the nose. Instead, as announced earlier this month, John Legend and Broadway star Cynthia Erivo will perform the Beach Boys song “God Only Knows” over the montage. “I heard that song for the first time in the context of loss—not lost love, but in the context of what would I be without you, someone who’s gone?” Ehrlich told the A.P. To Ehrlich, the appeal of these montages and tributes is much like the draw of the art itself: the personal connection that viewers have to memories of times, places, and people gone by. And after a year so defined by celebrity deaths, that connection might be more important now than ever.
