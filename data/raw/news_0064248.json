He added: 'In my opinion he used the leather belt to lower himself down to the floor below. 'The balcony door was left open because the occupant didn't expect anyone to come in that way.

When she looked out of the balcony she noticed a belt dangling down from the floor above and that netting, which protected the balconies from birds, had been ripped. She then looked down to the floor and saw Mr Heywood's body on the grass verge.
