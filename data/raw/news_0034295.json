Former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is on a break and is making most of his time by spending it with his family. After the recently concluded limited-overs series against England, MS Dhoni put out a video of him crawling along with his daughter on grass. A post shared by @mahi7781 on Feb 14, 2017 at 7:40am PST You would remember when two years ago, MS Dhoni became a father, he was in Australia for the 50-over World Cup and missed seeing his newly-born. When asked, he had told the journalists, \"I have been blessed with a baby daughter. Mum and daughter both are good. But as of now, I am on national duty so I think everything else can wait. The World Cup is a very important campaign.\" He will be seen back in action in Indian Premier League (IPL) 2017 where he will lead Rising Super Giants for the second year.
