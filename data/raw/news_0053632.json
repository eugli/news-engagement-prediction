The team plans to keep fighting at the Capitol. The Arizona Coyotes face off against the Detroit Red Wings on Jan. 14, 2016, in Glendale. The Coyotes are now in the hunt for a new playing venue, hoping to move out of Glendale's arena. The team is pushing legislation that would allow the creation of a special taxing district to help finance a new venue.

Two influential Republicans and many Democrats oppose plan, lawmakers say. CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nA plan that would provide $225 million in public financing for a new $395 million Arizona Coyotes arena likely does not have the votes to pass the state Senate, key lawmakers told The Arizona Republic/ azcentral Thursday. \nSens. Debbie Lesko, R-Peoria, and John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, said they definitely were going to vote against the plan, while Minority Leader Katie Hobbs, D-Phoenix, said there is little support among the chamber's 13 Democrats. Meanwhile, Senate President Steve Yarbrough, R-Chandler, said he had \"serious reservations\" about the plan that would allow the National Hockey League team to build an arena in downtown Phoenix or the East Valley. \nIt would take at least 16 votes to pass Senate Bill 1149 in the GOP-controlled Senate, where Republicans have a 17-13 advantage. Statements from those lawmakers make it appear unlikely that there is enough support to move the plan to the House. \nROBERTS: A $225 million subsidy for Coyotes? Really? \n\"We are still working on it. It's not easy,\" said Sen. Bob Worsley, R-Mesa, the bill's sponsor. \nWorsley, needing bipartisan help, took the unusual approach of appealing directly Thursday to Senate Democrats during their caucus meeting. Hobbs said she allowed Worsley to pitch to Democrats because he's been friendly to their causes. Yet, she said he didn't win over many supporters. Coyotes continue push \nThe Coyotes want out of Gila River Arena, a 13-year-old facility built specifically for the team and funded chiefly by Glendale taxpayers. The city in 2015 stopped subsidizing the team by canceling an arena management deal with the Coyotes. The team says playing in the West Valley is not financially viable because the arena is not close to the majority of its fans and sponsors. \nCoyotes Chief Executive Anthony LeBlanc said the team will continue seeking support at the Legislature. \n\"There are a lot of moving parts in this legislative process and everything is malleable and open for discussion until the very end. We will continue to educate lawmakers about a complex project that creates a true public-private partnership and offers the Coyotes an economically viable solution to remain in the Valley for the long term,\" LeBlanc said. \nThe bill would allow creation of \"community engagement\" districts of up to 30 acres. Up to half of the state's share of sales taxes generated from retail and hotel stays within a district would be dedicated to paying bond debt for new sports or entertainment facilities there. It also would allow an additional 2 percent district sales tax to be applied to all purchases within the district, with those revenues also dedicated to defraying the cost of facility construction. \nFor the Coyotes, the plan envisions public funding covering 57 percent of a new arena's cost, with new sales taxes covering $170 million and the host city contributing $55 million. The Coyotes said the team's portion would be $170 million, amounting to a 43 percent contribution toward the planned $395 million total cost of a new facility. The Coyotes also would control real estate and hotel development planned within the district, giving the team additional revenue. The team wants a slightly smaller arena with a larger lower bowl than its currently home, allowing the Coyotes to raise ticket prices for premium seats. \nSB 1149 last week passed out of the Senate Transportation and Technology Committee, which Worsley chairs. On Thursday, it sailed through the Senate Rules Committee, typically a perfunctory move before heading to the full Senate. A vote before the full Senate could occur next week. Glendale officials lobby against bill \nThe team and Glendale officials have aggressively lobbied lawmakers on the bill, with Glendale trying to kill it. West Valley lawmakers in the House also have voiced opposition to the legislation. \nThe Coyotes are contractually bound to stay in Glendale through the 2017-18 season. The city has a $13 million annual debt payment on the arena through 2033, bearing most of the construction debt.
