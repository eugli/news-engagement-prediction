It will be up to farmers to decide whether this is an economic and viable crop for them and also manufacturers to look at if they can economically make ... things like building products, textiles and cosmetics.\" \nMr Maher said the issue was separate from any legalisation of medical marijuana use, which was federally regulated. \nHe said the SA Government was willing to back any industry offering an economic benefit to the state, including possibly medical marijuana. Hemp industry booming \nIndustrial Hemp Association official Teresa McDowell welcomed the Government's support of the bill before the SA Parliament.

(ABC News) \n\"The industry globally is multi-faceted and worth billions of dollars â€” if you look at the hemp food industry globally, places like Canada exported $114 million worth of food and in America the industry is worth $576 million per year,\" she said. \n\"Economically it's an incredible resource and one that we just need to allow our state to tap into.\" \nShe said getting federal legislative approval for consumption of hemp food products was her industry's next hope. \nWade Dabinet, of Grain Producers Australia, volunteered his Mallee property for commercial trials in anticipation that hemp can give primary producers another crop rotation and let them into global markets. \n\"With legislative change, it's going to take some time so we'll look this year to work with [primary industry authorities] to get some trials up and running, so when the change comes in we can hit the ground running and hopefully it is a viable option,\" he said. \n\"There is certainly a lot of [farmers'] interest, but it's hard to be interested until you know if it's going to work. It's all about doing the trials, seeing if the timing works, time of sowing versus when we harvest it. \n\"It looks as though our climate is well suited to grow it.\" \nIf South Australian legislation passes, crop trials could get underway this year. \nThe state Liberal Party is considering its position on industrial hemp and frontbencher David Ridgway said he plans to discuss it with colleagues in the party room this week.
