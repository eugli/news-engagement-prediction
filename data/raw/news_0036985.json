It features a 6,000 square foot span designed by Ivanka Trump, 147 luxury hotel rooms, plus penthouses going for as much as $20 million. \n\"It will be a spectacular addition to a very beautiful city,\" Donald Trump said in 2013 when he came to launch the project. \nDevelopers have touted it as \"Vancouver's landmark address\" and an invitation on its website invites the well-heeled to \"Join the Trump lifestyle.\" \nNot everyone has been that happy with the landmark. \"Trump's name and brand have no more place on Vancouver's skyline than his ignorant ideas have in the modern world,\" Vancouver Mayor Greggor Robertson wrote in a December, 2015, letter asking Holborn to find another name. \nJoo Kim Tiah, CEO and president of Holyborn Group, has posted photos on Instagram of his fun time at the Trump inauguration last month. The momentos, the Vancouver Sun reported, include a Liberty Ball identity badge, a ticket to the official inauguration ceremonies and a photo of Tiah. \nThe hotel may bear the moniker of a celebrated Vancouver architect, the late Arthur Erickson, but some believe the Trump name symbolizes values at odds with those of Vancouver. \n\"I think none of it reflects our tolerant, progressive, dynamic city: There is noting coveted about Mr. Trump's open bigotry, disdain for the environment, promotion of inequality and contempt for others,\" Adrian Dix, a member of the British Columbia Legislature from Vancouver, said recently. \nThe tower at 1133 W. Georgia, Vancouver's second tallest building, has already attracted a women's march and other protests. \nA construction worker, a naturalized Canadian citizen but born in Mexico, made his way to the top while the building was still under construction, and unfurled a Mexican flag. \nOne online jokester temporarily renamed the cite \"Dump International Hotel and Tower\" on Google Maps in November. \nThe London-based Financial Times has raised more serious questions about the hotel, managed by but not owned by the Trump Organization. \n\"The Vancouver development . . . highlights the potential for conflict for a sitting President who has refused to sever ties with his still-expanding business empire,\" it wrote this week. \n\"Like some of Mr. Trump's other properties, the Vancouver development raises the risk of violating the emoluments clause in the U.S. Constitution prohibiting elected officials from receiving benefits from foreign governments. \n\"The hotel also invites scrutiny of (Trump's) business partners such as the elder Mr. Tiah, who was convicted of providing a flase report to the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange.\" \nHolborn Properties is based in Vancouver and is headed by Koo Lim Tiah. But it is supported by TA Enterprise, the Malaysia-based firm of his father, Tony Tiah Thee Kiah.
