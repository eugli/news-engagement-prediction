Driver was banned from driving for grab but grab did not report it to the police. Why is grab hiding from drivers cheating on their platform and kept quiet from the police? To hide their reputation? Or to prevent future legal harrassment? \nAs seen on the FB forum, there were many other drivers caught cheating on grab but grab too did not report the incident to the police. \nThis is scary, what security could grab provides for their passengers in use of their platform in such irresponsible action of hiding their drivers' illegal deeds? How many more wrong things did grab hide from the public about their drivers on the road? What has singapore becomes? Something needed to be done as soon as possible. \nPikachia A.S.S.
