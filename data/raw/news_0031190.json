And citizens will be able to taste the best of cuisines from the country cooked by Singh. \n\n\"I was always fond of cooking variety of dishes. In fact, I have been cooking from the age of 10 and the passion for preparing different dishes grew with the time. Also, I have travelled across the country and learnt to prepare cuisines of different states and cultures,\" Singh told TOI. \n\n\"The non-stop cooking attempt is not just to break the world record but also to promote Indian culture and cuisines at global level. The last Guinness World Record for non-stopping cooking is held by Benjamin Perry, an American, who cooked for 40 straight hours,\" Singh, 30, said. The 'Cookathon 2017' will start on Thursday at 10 am in the mall at the Ved Transcube Plaza, ST Depot in Sayajigunj and end at 4 pm on Saturday. \n\nFrom Kesar Pista Firni to Maharashtra's Misal Paav, Bihar's Lithi Chokha, Punjab's Sarson da Saag, Makke Di Roti to Gujarat's Baajra no Rotlo, Singh will cook at least 200 delicacies. \"I will prepare four cuisines each of the 23 states. I will have to leave out north eastern states as their prime delicacies are non-vegetarian and I will be preparing only vegetarian food in the Cookathon,\" Singh added. \n\nSingh will have to strictly follow the rules of taking short breaks during the marathon effort and a physiotherapist will ensure that she doesn't face any physical strain. \"I have picked up authentic ingredients to prepare the cuisines that will taste just like the ones prepared in each state,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:39:03.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
