I'd been dreaming about seeing the country for years and was so happy when my dream became a reality! Now, I officially have the Travel Bug, and my list of dream countries to visit is even longer. Here are my top three dream destinations! ICELAND I've never seen the Northern Lights and the word on the street is that Iceland is one of the best places to view them. You can also go whale watching, visit the Skaftafell Ice Cave, and eat at delicious, highly-rated restaurants! And I definitely want to see Kirkjufell Mountain, a stunning green mountain that sticks out of a totally flat landscape!

New Zealand is famous for its lush, stunning landscapes. But beyond that, there are tons of activities to do and adventures to be had! Queenstown sits right at the foot of a mountain and has wine tastings, rafting, hiking, and great dining options. You can also visit the hot mud pools in Rotorua (which sounds crazy relaxing!) and, of course, you can tour the locations where LOTR was filmed!

There are the famous historical locations to visit like the Acropolis, Parthenon, and the Delphi Ruins. But Greece also has insanely beautiful beaches and lagoons, the National Archeological Museum in Athens, and sightseeing options that will make any tourist happy. (Love mountains? Greece has mountains! Love little towns! Greece has little towns! Love the word \"spinalonga?\" Greece has an island called Spinalonga!) A post shared by НашаПланета - Рай!
