He averaged 11.45 strikeouts per nine innings last season. (Brian O'Mahoney / Pioneer Press) Jonah Rosenblum Pioneer Press \nOakton baseball coach Bill Fratto brings it up over and over. His latest star, Brandon Nowak, looks a lot like Boston Red Sox ace Chris Sale . \nNowak, a sophomore who has signed with the Miami Hurricanes , shrugs off the comparison. Sure, he's a tall southpaw with a funky delivery and a fastball that peaks in the 90s, just like Sale, but even though he's from Chicago, where Sale spent the first seven years of his major league career with the White Sox , it's not like he modeled himself after Sale. \n\"I've heard for several years that I kind of throw like him,\" Nowak said. \"I'm not the biggest kid. I'm tall and lengthy. I try getting the most out of my body type.\" \nOakton, a Division III junior college program, opens its season on Sunday with a doubleheader against Hibbing (Minn.) at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. \nThe Sale comparison goes further. \nLike Sale, who wasn't heavily recruited out of high school but was drafted 13th overall in 2010, Nowak was somewhat of a late bloomer coming out of Notre Dame College Prep. \n\"He was basically under the radar. He didn't pitch a lot. He was a kid growing into his body,\" Fratto said. \"Him coming in as a freshman, we didn't know what we were going to get. When the spring season started, he was absolutely dominant.\" \nIf Nowak was a late bloomer, he made a quick impression on Fratto. He could tell Nowak had the right stuff from his second start last season, against Rowan Gloucester (N.J.). Nowak loaded the bases with no outs and the heart of the lineup coming up. Even more frustrating, Nowak recalled loading the bases on a bloop hit, an error and a pitch that hit the batter's foot. With several college scouts in attendance, Nowak was desperate to escape the jam and show his stuff. \n\"I've got to prove myself somehow,\" Nowak recalled thinking. \"I was trying to make a good first impression. That was the first time anyone's heard of me or came out to see me. I didn't want people to think I'm a fluke. I had to be patient, take a deep breath and control what I could control.\" \nNowak responded by striking out the side, posting nine strikeouts over six shutout innings for his first win. \n\"I was in the dugout and looked at my other coaches and said, 'This kid is going to be really good,'\" Fratto said. \"Any other freshman I had would basically blow up in this situation. His composure was just different than anyone else right then. I knew he'd be special.\" \nThe strikeouts never stopped. Twelve days later, he struck out eight over five frames to earn his second win. On April 5, he notched 10 strikeouts over six one-run innings. He tallied seven-plus strikeouts in each of his first six starts, finishing the year with a decent earned run average (4.27) and an astounding strikeout rate (11.45 per nine innings). \nThe strikeouts were based off a fastball in the high 80s and low 90s paired with a nasty slider and changeup. The slider, while most effective in lefty-on-lefty situations, even befuddled a number of right-handed hitters, according to Fratto. \n\"If you've got a funky delivery, which Brandon does, it's a Chris Sale delivery, from the side, three-quarters, it's really tough on left-handed hitters,\" Fratto said. \"His slider is pretty nasty. Not many left-handers can hit him.\" \nSoon, Fratto wasn't the only one projecting big things for the freshman. \nFratto, in his decade-plus at Oakton, has sent plenty of prospects to play Division I baseball. Still, he said, he's never experienced anything like the buzz Nowak brought. \n\"My phone was being blown up last year from major universities across the country,\" Fratto said. \"He's probably the most sought-after kid I've had thus far.\" \nIf Fratto was stunned by the attention, Nowak was even more so. He went from barely recruited out of high school to heavily recruited with aspirations of professional baseball during his freshman year — in other words, from beginning to think about a new career to potentially making good money on the diamond. \n\"It all hit me very quickly,\" Nowak said. \"I had no idea what to expect.\" \nEven though myriad schools were courting him, Miami was a relatively easy decision. Accustomed to bitterly cold Chicagoland weather, Nowak had long been interested in the Sunshine State. When he visited Coral Gables, Fla., he was also struck by the coaching staff, which he described as a mixture of caring and down-to-earth. \nEver since committing, the thought of warmer weather has continued to tug at him. \n\"Going outside, starting my car to go to school, having to get in that car for five minutes to even warm up, next year, I'll be able to walk outside and feel that refreshing 80-degree weather all year-round,\" Nowak said. \nIn the meanwhile, Oakton expects big things. \nThat's not to say it will be easy. Fratto told Nowak that the opposition will be ready for him this year — foes will be more accustomed to his funky motion the second time around. Fratto told Nowak that he would have to be even tougher in 2017 and loved the response he got: \"I'm ready.\" \n\"Is he going to be 8-1?\" Fratto said. \"He could be 12-0. Who knows? We don't know. Every time I give him the ball, he's going to compete, and he's going to compete at a level that I'm going to be in a relaxed state of mind in the dugout knowing Brandon is on the mound.\" \nJonah Rosenblum is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press. \nTwitter @Pioneer_Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:35:32.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
