(AP) — The Texas Rangers acquired right-handed knuckleballer Eddie Gamboa from the Tampa Bay Rays on Tuesday, when they placed reliever Jake Diekman and first baseman Prince Fielder on the 60-day disabled list. \nThe moves by the AL West champions came on the same day pitchers and catchers reported to spring training. \nFielder was forced to quit playing last summer after his second neck surgery, but is under contract through 2020 for $24 million a season. He has to remain on the Rangers roster for them to recoup some of that money through an insurance policy. \nDiekman is expected to miss at least half of the season during treatment for the ulcerative colitis, a digestive condition he has dealt with much of his life. He had surgery Jan. 25, the first of a series of scheduled procedures to remove his colon. Even though he can’t participate in any individual or team drills, Diekman was in camp Tuesday to be with his teammates \nGamboa goes to the Rangers for a player to be named later or cash considerations. He was 0-2 with a 1.35 ERA in seven relief appearances for the Rays last season, the first major league action for the 32-year-old pitcher. \nSince Fielder didn’t formally retire, he had to remain on the Rangers’ 40-man roster during the offseason. But he can be placed on the 60-day disabled list once camp opens and not count against their roster limit. \nFielder got a $214 million, nine-year contract in 2012 from Detroit, which traded the slugger to Texas after two seasons. The Tigers owe Texas about $6 million a year as part of that November 2013 deal, and the Rangers are responsible for the remaining $18 million a year, about half of which will be covered by disability insurance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:01:23.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
