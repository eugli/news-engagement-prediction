I'm thinking where can I walk my dogs now?\"\nAnother concerned owner said: \"We're quite concerned because one of our dogs will go for any kind of food and if they run of the lead, you don't see where they're going.\"\nThis latest suspected poisoning comes less than two week after three dogs suffered seizures after walking on an Ovingham riverside path.\nOne of those dogs, Scrumpy, sadly died.\nScrumpy died after suffering a seizure shortly a walk in Ovingham. Vets can't link the incidents, but admit slug pellets would cause symptoms like seizures.\nThe chemical Metaldehyde found in slug pellets is very toxic to dogs. It causes neurological symptoms, it can be a very rapid onset, so within half an hour of them eating the slug pellets they can start to show signs.\n\"These can range from just tremors and twitching, but it can get worse and go to full convulsions and seizures which are life threatening.\"\n– Helena Guest, Scott Mitchell Associates Vets A sample of the slug pellets found at Tyne Green Northumberland County Council removed the pellets which were found on Tuesday from the Tyne Green site.\nPolice are warning dog walkers to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity.Officers are making further enquiries and will continue to patrol the affected area.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:11:47.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
