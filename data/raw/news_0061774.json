The new jobs stem from DHL’s $108 million expansion of its hub at CVG and will raise its workforce there to more than 3,300 from its current 2,400. Enlarge ​DHL Express plans to hire 900 new employees for its Americas Hub at the… more “We are excited to leverage our newly expanded Americas Hub and welcome talented potential candidates to fill these new positions,” DHL Express Americas CEO Mike Parra said in a statement. “As we look to the future, we know the continued investment in motivated people is the key to ensuring that we meet the demands of our customers and have the ability to handle the continued growth and expansion that will occur at our CVG hub location.” The open positions are for DHL’s new seven-day-a-week daytime shift as well as existing evening shifts including supervisory roles. Full-time and part-time positions that provide health benefits and tuition reimbursement as well as flexible scheduling are available. Interested applicants can attend a job fair 9 a.m.-5 p.m. on March 4 at the CVG Centre, 77 Comair Blvd., Erlanger. Applicants should bring two forms of government-issued ID and be able to pass a background check and pre-employment drug test. Questions about the positions can be directed to 859-817-8770, ext. 5. DHL’s latest expansion includes a north ramp on 45 acres of land that provides parking for 16 additional planes and brings its total capacity at CVG to 65 gates. In addition, DHL is adding more automated sorting capabilities and 40 new reload positions that will enhance its ability to meet its growing shipment volume. The new facility also contains storage and warehouse space. DHL has invested more than $280 million in its CVG hub since 2009, including a $46 million investment in 2014 to upgrade its small-sorting equipment and create 130 new jobs. The company, part of German firm Deutsche Post DHL, employs 2,400 people in Northern Kentucky, a growth of 50 percent of the past seven years. “DHL is a tremendous business partner at CVG, and we’re pleased about their continued investment and job growth in our community,” CVG CEO Candace McGraw said in a statement.“These additional 900 jobs is another demonstration of DHL’s positive impact on the Tri-State region.” DHL’s announcement follows Amazon.com Inc.’s recent commitment to build a $1.5 billion Prime Air hub at the airport , which will bring 600 new jobs by its sixth year there and a potential of 2,700 workers by the time its plans are fully built out. DHL processes about 50 million international shipments a year and connects 100 service centers to more than 220 countries around the world, including DHL’s two other hubs in Leipzig, Germany, and Hong Kong. DHL is the eighth-largest employer in Northern Kentucky. Caproni heads up web operations for the Business Courier.
