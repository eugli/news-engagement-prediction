Ad Feedback \n\"From my observation, the majority of the losses have resulted from changes in farming methods … My understanding is that change has occurred with little scrutiny of the significant ecological values that may have been affected, despite them being areas that were considered to have supported significant ecological values.\" \nUnder cross-examination, Head said the loss of rare ecosystems meant protecting those still there was increasingly urgent. \n\"Because the Mackenzie has such a distinct ecological character, the more you lose of these ecosystems, the less chance you have to protect representative examples of those ecosystems elsewhere. \n\"It underpins why some of these remaining ecosystems are nationally significant.\" \nDOC senior ranger of biodiversity Dean Nelson said if development continued at its current rate it risked creating isolated populations of some species. \n\"For a lot of species it becomes difficult for them to maintain their populations if they're restricted to little pockets and don't have the ability to traverse large areas,\" he said. \n\"Invertebrates, particularly lizards … they're not going to cross areas of green grass. If they've got existing vegetation and habitats then they can continue to move.\" \nIn his written evidence he said that nutrient run-off could have an impact on fresh water species. \nWhen asked if Environment Canterbury's nutrient rules for the area would mitigate that, he said he was not convinced. \n\"I don't think we've seen that it has necessarily worked.\" \nOther experts, including agronomist Warwick Scott and ecologist Susan Walker, expressed concern about the rate of development in parts of the basin. \nThe hearing is expected to conclude next week. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T13:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:09:52.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
