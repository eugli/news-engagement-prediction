The comet then passes through the constellations Corona Borealis (the Northern Crown), Boötes (the Herdsman), Canes Venatici (Boötes’ hunting dogs) and Ursa Major,” according to NASA.\nMORE: Eight strange signs that you’re more intelligent than average\nMORE: 10 tips to make your iPhone battery last longer\nThe comet won’t be visible to the naked eye, but can be spotted with a telescope or binoculars. Those hoping to see it will have a better chance by staying away from the light pollution of buildings and street lights in urban areas.\nThe comet will return in 2022.", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/LAyuPrqt1euCtN7ph.PgxA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzAwO2g9NDMy/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/7cb6ad16d3bf70112a4372426b704ba9", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DxJ4.OmXhvEuuKFss3f1zw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NDc2/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/19c90670605fe8a3dabb32f1a72cac47", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DxJ4.OmXhvEuuKFss3f1zw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NDc2/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/19c90670605fe8a3dabb32f1a72cac47);", "https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150604/orb.png);"], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:16:33.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
