Read more NASA's Space Launch System counts down to liftoff \nDependent upon clear skies and auroral activity, the near simultaneous launch of two NASA sounding rockets will take place in Alaska, on February 13 or March 3 between 7:00 pm and midnight local time. \nTwo 56-foot long Black Brant IX rockets will fly for 10 minutes, one of which will be decorating the sky with white luminescent artificial clouds, in an effort to “understand the height-dependent processes that create localized neutral jets within the aurora,” NASA says . \nThe lower altitude rocket will be forming the artificial clouds at an apogee of about 107 miles, the other is scheduled to fly for 201 miles apogee. \n“Flying the two similar payloads simultaneously to different altitudes will provide researchers unprecedented vertical measurements within an aurora,” NASA wrote. Sounding rocket with instruments to explore the aurora will form white artificial clouds in space.
