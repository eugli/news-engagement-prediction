Nodal becomes the first regional Mexican act to reach the top five since Banda Sinaloense MS de Sergio Lizarraga ’s “Solo Con Verte” peaked at No. 2 in February 2016. \nNodal’s track earned 3.8 million streams in the tracking week ending Feb. 9, a 37 percent increase. Of its total streams, 47 percent stem from YouTube views, where an official music video for the song has more than 20 million global views since its Jan. 13 release. \n“Adios Amor” also rises 32 percent in sales (to 2,000 downloads), pushing the track 17-8 on the Latin Digital Song Sales chart -- his first time in the top 10. A 27 percent increase at radio (in the week ending Feb. 12) lifts the track 27-22 for a new peak on the overall Latin Airplay chart. \nNodal is the latest regional Mexican singer under the age of 21 to dot the top half of Hot Latin Songs in the last year -- a notable feat for a genre historically dominated by older artists. Other 21-and-under regional Mexican artists who have reached the top 25 during the past year (as soloists or band frontmen): Adriel Favela , Alta Consigna , Crecer Germán , Ulices Chaidez y Sus Plebes , Alfredo Olivas and Jose Manuel López Castro of Los Plebes del Rancho de Ariel Camacho . \nSofia Reyes Tops Sales: Elsewhere, 21-year-old Sofia Reyes earns the No. 1 debut on the Latin Album Sales chart with Louder! , shifting 1,000 copies in its first week. Reyes, a Mexican pop act, concurrently spends a ninth week on the Latin Pop Songs chart (at No. 24) with “Llegaste Tu,” featuring Reykon (down four percent in spins). She topped the chart in April 2016 with album single “Solo Yo” featuring Prince Royce . In all, four songs from the new set have dotted the airplay chart. \nLouder! bows at No. 23 on the consumption-based Top Latin Albums ranking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:29:41.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
