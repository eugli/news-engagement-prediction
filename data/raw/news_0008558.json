His full comments (1/3): https://t.co/xkutyIjrYO 2/2/2017, 11:26:27 PM It's the second time in the past week that Smith has spoken publicly about the drug policy and marijuana in particular.

I expect, and we put on that list, the drug policy as one of those issues.\" The topic of marijuana use among NFL players, especially for pain relief, has become more prevalent, with a number of former players—including Jim McMahon, Kyle Turley, Nate Jackson and Eben Britton—acting as proponents for marijuana rather than opiates for pain tolerance, a regular need for NFL players given the violent nature of the game. According to Sam Levin of the Guardian , \" A 2011 study of 644 retired players found that former NFL players were three times more likely to abuse prescription painkillers than the general population and that 71 percent reported misusing medication.\" Like the new article format? !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:05:04.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
