Along with Anil and Arjun, Athiya Shetty and Ileana D’Cruz will also be seen in Aneez Bazmee’s flick. \nHere’s what Indian Express was told by Dev: \n“God has been kind. I was sceptical about doing Bigg Boss but it was good, the show’s host supported me, he said on national TV that we should work together in the future. I have got Mubarakan, after he put in a word about me to the makers. I will soon be off to London to shoot for the film. It is a beautiful role. Also, I am doing my first fiction show. So, things are looking up for me. I am very excited.” \nSource \nWell, it isn’t the first time that any BB contestant got a movie on Sallu’s recommendation. It was because of him that Sana Khan and Armaan Kohli grabbed roles in “Jai Ho” and “Prem Ratan Dhan Payo” respectively. \nIt appears as if the career of Rahul will be back on track shortly because he is entering the Television industry as well with the show “Dil Bole Oberoi”. \nIt will be interesting to see Rahul on silver screen after long! Are you excited?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T16:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T11:55:18.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
