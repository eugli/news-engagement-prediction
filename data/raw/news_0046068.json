Moderators may allow gifs that have gotten an extremely low score in the past, but that is not guaranteed. Do not post gifs that have gotten more than 1500 points (at the time of posting) elsewhere on reddit in the last two weeks . This includes videos converted to gif formats. Cross-posts after this time are allowed. \nPlease use Karma Decay to see if your gif has already been submitted. Frequent violations of this rule may result in a ban. \nPlease help us enforce this rule by reporting offending submissions. Please include a link to the original reddit submission in your report or modmail if you have it. \nNo Reaction, HIFW, Analogy, Cake Day, or Upvote gifs. There are already subreddits more suited for this kind of content. (This rule does not apply to comments) \nDo not post gifs that should be videos. Incredibly long gifs or content much better suited to video formats will be removed. Duration must be less than or equal to twenty (≤20) seconds. \nDirect image links REQUIRED .

Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment, and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments. \nNudity, porn, gore, and other obscene material are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions. If it can get you fired then it should not be here. Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. There are other subreddits dedicated to NSFW content. Please mark risqué posts and comments as NSFW. \nTitles must be descriptive. Do not make submissions with the title \"This\", \"This is my favorite gif\", etc. \nNo hate speech of any kind. Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban. \nPlease familiarize yourself with the official rules and reddiquette . We will remove any posts violating reddit's official rules (spam, personal information, vote manipulation, etc.) and reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit. \nPlease Note: Bot accounts are not allowed.
