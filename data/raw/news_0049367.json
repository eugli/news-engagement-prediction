He didn't budge on that retirement. The Red Sox reported to spring training camp last week, and Ortiz wasn't there. \nHe is retired, and he's doing what retired baseball players should do during spring training. He's lounging on a beach. My spring training ðŸ˜Ž pic.twitter.com/6efcdohjlJ â€” David Ortiz (@davidortiz) February 19, 2017 \n\"This is my spring training,\" Ortiz said. \nYeah, that looks a lot better than spring training. He's not coming back any time soon.
