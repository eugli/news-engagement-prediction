That's a big snake,\" another onlooked exclaimed as Oli and the snake emerged unharmed. \nOli helps place the snake in the bag. \nAnother man then helped Oli coax the snake into a bag: \"Hop in there mate, it's more comfy in there, it's nicer,\" he said. \nAfter a round of congratualtions, Oli's father Chazza Wardrope approached to offer his son a handshake, and later took to Facebook to express his pride. \n\"That's my boy! Been wrangling snakes since he was five!\" Related reading Selfie gone wrong: US teen's pet snake gets stuck in her earlobe A US teen has become a social media sensation after she lived to tell the tale of how her pet snake ended up stuck in her earlobe.
