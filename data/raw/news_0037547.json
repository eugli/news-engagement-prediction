The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has signed an agreement with Kreative Company Events, a specialist provider of Skype Communication Services for the Business Sector. The agreement provides for the company to provide remote instant interpretation of driving theoretical tests conducted by RTA to driver license applicants in 198 global languages. The step is part of RTA's endeavors to enrich the Smart City initiative and realize its third strategic goal (People Happiness). Ahmed Bahrozyan, CEO of RTA's Licensing Agency, said, \"The agreement is intended to provide a remote instant translation of theoretical driver tests in all languages spoken by driver license applicants. \"The company would source a translator from any place in the world to interact with the examinee through Skype Phone technology at the testing centers to translate the questions of the on-screen theoretical test in the languages spoken by examinees, which, according to the agreement, amount to 198 languages. \"The company would bear installation costs of telephone communications sets for use exclusively in testing centers; be it in the RTA or supervised by the RTA. The system enables examinees to clearly understand the rules of driving and traffic by selecting the suitable language that would eventually enhance the safety of the driver and road users after passing the tests and obtaining the driver license.\" Explaining the mechanism of the new system, Bahrozyan said, \"The examinees has to submit an application for appointing an interpreter in the preferred language seven days before the test appointment and pay the applicable fees. \"The company would be communicated about the type of the intended language. To ensure that translators are neutral and do not overstep their assignments, the company has provided a recording system connected to a smart monitoring center within RTA to ensure the governance and transparency pursued by RTA during the testing of applicant drivers.\" Arif Al-Malek, Director of Drivers Training and Qualification at RTA's Licensing Agency said, \"RTA's efforts to translate this massive number of languages spoken by examinees stems from its knowledge of the extensive multi-nationalities living in Dubai, the urbanization drive witnessed by the Emirate, and residents' perception of the need of obtaining driver licenses. So RTA has taken this step to ensure the fruition of its vision of providing Safe and Smooth Transport for All.\" Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T13:12:48.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
