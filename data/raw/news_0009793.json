We lost the assembly election only by 1.1 per cent vote share,\" he said. \"People voted in 2106 assembly election for AIADMK hoping J Jayalalithaa will be the chief minister,\" Stalin said a few hours after Sasikala was elected as AIADMK legislature party head. \"Even when Jayalalithaa was alive, she did not give any party job to Sasikala. When Jayalalithaa was in jail under the wealth case, O Panneerselvam was sworn in as chief minister and again when she was admitted to hospital, Panneerselvam was asked to take care of the departments of Jayalalithaa,\" the opposition leader said. PMK founder S Ramadoss also criticised the development in the ruling AIADMK. \"AIADMK got votes only due to Jayalalithaa and now a person who is no way connected to the people of the state has been selected to be the chief minister. This is nothing but deceiving the voters who voted for AIADMK,\" said PMK founder S Ramadoss in a statement. \"Though AIADMK contested in all the 234 seats in Tamil Nadu, Sasikala was not given ticket. Only a person who has been elected under the AIADMK party must have been chosen as chief minister and that is democracy,\" said Ramadoss. \"The election of Sasikala shows that party MLAs are going against Jayalalithaa as well as people,\" he said. CPM state secretary G Ramakrishnan, however, wished Sasikala over her election as AIADMK legislature party chief but asked her to address the peoples issues and wishes.
