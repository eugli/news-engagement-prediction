I want to add value. I want to make sure that people who are black are empowered. I want to make sure that even white people have a place in South Africa.” \nThe man whose salary increased by R1.5 million in two years while SABC was making a loss told the public broadcaster that he wants to help the unemployed. \n“What comes to my mind is land. What comes to my mind is education. Because we need to make sure that after university there is a future for young people. They are employed by the private sector including government.\" \nMotsoeneng was suspended in December 2016 when the High Court ruled that his appointment was unlawful. The judgment stated the SABC board failed to uphold the Constitution and ignored findings by the Public Protector that he had lied about his qualifications and awarded himself irregular salary hikes. The SABC is understood to be appealing the court decision. Share Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
