Terrance Ferguson joins the show to talk about his time in Australia, his improvement over the season, and his NBA Draft preparations.

J.R. Smith is a prime example. \nKyle Korver, traded to the Cavs in January, told Deron Williams, who will sign with Cleveland Monday, that Williams would love it here. \nSame goes for Bogut. \n4) What would his addition mean to Cavs title chances? \nIt’s hard to say how much Bogut would play in a Finals match with the Warriors. \nThen again, Golden State was never the same when Bogut injured his knee against the Cavs in June. \nLet’s put it this way, the Cavs are better with Bogut than without him. Andrew Bogut.

The best they can offer him is a prorated version of the veteran’s minimum $US1.55 million. \nIt’s going to be roughly $US500,000 for Bogut if he chooses the Cavs. \nThe Houston Rockets, meanwhile have $US3.5 million in cap space. They could give it all to Bogut. \nBut the Rockets are going to lose to the Warriors in the Western Conference playoffs, with or without Bogut. \nThe Cavs might beat the Warriors in the Finals. \nThat’s where Bogut wants to be, I think. \nOf course, all of this is moot until the Sixers waive him. That will probably happen, but there’s a chance it doesn’t. View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
