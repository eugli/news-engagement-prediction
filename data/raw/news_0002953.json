(Photo: Mark Henle/The Republic) \nA 35-year-old woman was shot dead in front of her two young children Tuesday morning in the parking lot of a north Phoenix apartment complex, according to police.\n\"I can still see her face in my mind,\" said Patricia Aguirre, 60, a neighbor who lived just a few feet away from the woman's apartment. \"(It's) really sad, really sad because of her kids.\"\nAguirre said she was helping her daughter get ready for high school when she heard her neighbor and a man having an argument in the parking lot, but she didn't pay attention until she heard gunshots and a car alarm blaring.\nThe car alarm went off twice before stopping, she remembered. Aguirre said she looked out the window just as a man was running off.\nNeither of the woman's children were harmed, and they were in the custody of the Phoenix Fire Department until authorities could locate an adult family member, according to Sgt. Vince Lewis, a Phoenix police spokesman.\nLewis said a resident of the complex near 25th Street and Greenway Parkway found the woman and called 911 around 6 a.m. She was pronounced dead at the scene.\nSeveral residents, including Aguirre, said the mother of two resided in the apartment complex.\nNeighbors described the woman as quiet but kind. She didn't speak English, they said, and mostly kept to herself for the 8 months or so that she and her children had lived there.\n\"She never socialized with anyone, and she wouldn't let anyone step one foot into her apartment,\" Aguirre said, \"but you could tell her main focus was taking care of her kids. We were all so happy that she recently bought her car so she wouldn't have to walk everywhere with her babies anymore.\"\nReturn to azcentral.com for more details. \nPhoenix police said a mother was shot dead while loading her two children into a car around 6 a.m. at a north Phoenix apartment complex on Jan. 31, 2017.
