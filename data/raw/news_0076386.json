We had the purest and strongest love, one that will live on forever. He has changed my life and I hope to continue to make him proud every single day,\" she wrote.\nShe added that money which had been donated would be distributed to other causes.\n\"Matt and I had many discussions about where the money would go, should something happen. Please rest assured that all of the money will be divided between research and comfort for patients in hospital rooms. I will not rush in donating this money as I want to make sure to do it properly, as Matt would have wanted.\"\nNo funeral arrangements have yet been made.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:56:16.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
