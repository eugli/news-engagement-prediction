The outfielder hit .276 with 40 home runs, 125 RBIs, 21 stolen bases, a .591 slugging percentage and a .941 OPS last season with Double-A Reading. He led the Minor Leagues in home runs, RBIs, extra-base hits (83) and total bases (308). Cozens, who is expected to open the season at Triple-A Lehigh Valley, set Reading's single-season home run record, earning the Eastern League MVP Award and a spot on the SiriusXM MLB All-Star Futures Game roster. \n• Spring Training: Tickets | Schedule | Ballpark | Gear | Coverage \n\"He had unbelievable numbers last year, so why even tinker with that? Why?\" Stairs said. \"I'm not the type of guy that has to put my thumbprint on him.\" \nCozens, who went 0-for-1 with a strikeout in Friday's 9-4 loss to the Yankees , has settled into a swing that could have him in the big leagues before the end of the season. It took some experimentation to get to that point, but Cozens said he has been comfortable with his swing for the past year. Cozens on Spring Training invite Cozens on Spring Training invite, talented Phils team Dylan Cozens discusses being invited to Spring Training, improving his ability and being a part of a talented Phillies roster \n\"I feel like I've changed 100,000 times,\" Cozens said. \"I've been completely different. Way different. Everything: Stance, hand placement, timing, swing, you name it.\" \nCozens mimicked some of his previous stances this week at Spectrum Field. An early version had a bat waggle, almost like Darryl Strawberry or Gary Sheffield. In another, the 6-foot-6, 235-pounder seemed to crouch like Pete Rose. Top Prospects: Cozens, PHI Top Prospects: Dylan Cozens, OF, Phillies 2017 MLB.com Top Prospects: Dylan Cozens has shown the ability to use the whole field, especially with two strikes \nBut then he watched Barry Bonds videos and a hitting tutorial with Blue Jays slugger Josh Donaldson on MLB Network, which affirmed what Cozens wanted to do. \nThe result is a leg kick and hands that hold the bat more upright than flat. MLB Central: Josh Donaldson Josh Donaldson joins Mark DeRosa to discuss his swing On MLB Central, Josh Donaldson joins Mark DeRosa to talk about his swing and why he uses such a big leg kick \n\"It was fun watching [Donaldson] break down his swing physically, seeing how balanced he was,\" Cozens said. \"He was able to get everything loaded and get everything ready so he was ready to attack the ball with everything that he had. \n\"Keeping the hands loose. Keeping the arms loose. Not trying to over-swing.\" \nCozens crushed a home run to center field through the wind on Thursday in an exhibition against the University of Tampa. The ball hit off the end of his bat. Stairs said Cozens thought he broke his bat. Cozens' two-run homer UTA@PHI: Cozens hits a two-run home run Dylan Cozens hits a two-run homer to center field to give the Phillies a 5-0 lead in the 5th inning \n\"Stupid power,\" Stairs said. \nSo what gets Cozens to the big leagues this year? More of the same, really. Maybe more contact, too. He struck out 186 times in 586 plate appearances last year. (He also walked 61 times for a .350 on-base percentage.) Of course, if Cozens hits 40-plus homers, nobody will care about the strikeouts. Remember that Ryan Howard hit 284 home runs and struck out 1,194 times in 4,367 plate appearances in his prime from 2005-11. \n\"I think this offseason they put him a little closer to home plate, which they think will help him stay on pitches a little bit longer,\" Stairs said of Cozens. \"I think he's a type of guy that could cut 60 strikeouts. He can be a 120- to 125-[strikeout] guy, which is fine if you're hitting 600 at-bats a year. But I don't want people comparing him to Adam Dunn. Adam Dunn was all or nothing. Cozens can flat out hit.\" \nSaid Cozens: \"I feel like I've always got something to prove. I'm always trying to prove people wrong and get better, and if they've got a problem with my game, I'll try to show them it's not a problem.\" Even bigger goals this year. #hungry pic.twitter.com/FqIF7XMkWr — Dylan Cozens (@dylancozens) February 20, 2017 \nIn the meantime, Cozens just wants to stick in camp. \n\"I'm loving it so far,\" Cozens said. \"I don't want to leave, so I'm going to do everything I can to try to stay.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:26:54.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
