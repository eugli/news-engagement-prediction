Griezmann will accept £85m Manchester United move - but on one key condition \nAnd it’s not difficult to see why Costa is enjoying a sublime run under Antonio Conte, given this stunning effort in Chelsea training. \nAs Chelsea practiced their free-kick drills, Costa uploaded a video on Instagram of a simply unstoppable strike that left third-choice goalkeeper Eduardo helpless.
