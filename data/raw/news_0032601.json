What you need to know about immigration â legal and illegal â as Trump takes power \nAt the root of the rumors were a trio of executive orders on immigration by President Donald Trump. \nThey greatly expand who can be picked up and include those who \"committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense,\" regardless of the crime's severity and whether or not they've actually been charged. \nImmigration lawyer Noaman Azhar said his office was inundated with calls. \n\"People's concern with the hysteria is not just the executive orders but what's going to come next,\" Azhar said. \"Are there going to be more executive orders on immigration? Are the executive orders going to be even more extreme? Are they going to add more countries to the ban list?\" \nPerpetuating the panic are Facebook posts and mass texts with misleading information and a call to \"copy, paste and spread the word.\" Deportations? Crowd of Mexican immigrants seeks answers from their government about Trump \nBut Carl Rusnok, a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said on Friday that he knew of no beefed-up operations or deportations as a result of Trump's executive orders. He warned that media reports created panic. \n\"There are always things going on on a daily basis,\" the ICE spokesman said. \"People don't sit on their hands here. That is nothing new.\" \nOther \"target-rich\" communities in Texas and elsewhere across the country reported rising detainment and deportations. \nIn Austin, for example, the Mexican Consulate confirmed that 30 Mexican immigrants were detained by ICE on Friday and 14 were detained Thursday. By comparison, the Austin consulate had seen an average of four to five Mexican immigrants detained daily in recent years. Under Trump order, immigration agents raid 'target-rich' communities in Texas, elsewhere \nAs a result, know-your-rights workshops popped up with consistency in the Dallas area. \nOn Saturday a crowd gathered at the Kessler United Methodist Church to listen and then receive individual time with attorneys. They included the new civil rights director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR. \nCommunity organizer Liz Magallanes tells people that being harassed is \"not the new norm\" when it comes to speaking with authorities. She urged participants to lean on the Fifth Amendment and told them \"silence is golden.\" \nMagallanes was born in Mexico and is protected from deportation by an executive action by former President Barack Obama. So, she, too, has her personal worries. \nAttorneys and activists, some sporting \"resist\" buttons, urged immigrant parents to prepare for the worst and have a plan in place should they not make it home to their families. \n\"If they are taken into custody, who takes care of the children?\" said Sonali Patnaik, a Dallas immigration attorney. Austin council member sees flurry of ICE arrests as retaliation for sanctuary policies \nThey also advised people to pay any outstanding traffic tickets and to photograph or record any signs of a possible detention. \nStill others plan to divide Dallas into four quadrants so that protesters can get to the scene of any perceived injustice. \n\"We'll have rapid-response teams,\" said David Villalobos, an organizer with the Texas Organizing Project. \"We'll come out with a bullhorn and protest on the spot.\" \nRumors of a possible new threat spread quickly in the South Asian community in Carrollton when a text message about police profiling spun from phone to phone. \n\"Carrollton is the first city in Texas that passed a law this morning that the cops are allowed to ask for your immigration status if they pull u over while driving. Let everyone know. Serious.\" \nCity officials insist it was bogus. Several cities in North Texas have said that their officers don't typically ask people about their immigration status in routine traffic stops. \nCarrollton's mayor, himself, sought to debunk the rumor, noting that immigration questions usually come up when someone is booked into jail. \n\"None of our patrol officers address immigration issues and, unless someone is being booked into jail, they won't face immigration screening,\" Mayor Matthew Marchant said in an email. \"If an immigration issue is discovered during the booking process, our jailers coordinate a response with ICE and the appropriate consulate.\" Texas leaders want to punish 'sanctuary cities,' but local agencies wouldn't lose much cash \nBut worries are high that could change. \nUnder one of the executive orders of Jan. 25 , state and local law enforcement officers would be allowed to \"perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension or detention of aliens.\" \nIn the face of shifting policy, a hotlinem called \" MigraWatch \" was set up by young immigrants organized by United We Dream. These so-called \"dreamers\" have prepared \"defense cards\" in multiple languages to head off deportations. \nFrancisco de la Torre, the Mexican consul in Dallas, has even prepared a promotional video in which various community members urge people to defend and prepare themselves. The word deportation or Trump is never mentioned. \n\"These are times for unity,\" the diplomat says to begin the video. \nOn Thursday, the Mexican consulate will hold a community meeting at 7 p.m. in its gallery space at its offices at 1210 River Bend Drive. \nA similar meeting at the Mexican consulate was held shortly after Trump was elected. De la Torre promised that the Mexican government would be there to help and speakers, including Dallas police officers, tried to reassure the crowd they supported them. \nAt the immigration workshop on Saturday at the church, Dallas immigration attorney Paul Zoltan wore a blue police officer's cap to heighten the drama as he ran a crowd through drills on how to respond if an ICE agent asked questions. \n\"In traffic stops, they can only hold you to see if you have a license and insurance,\" he said. \nAfter that, Zoltan said, \"Zip it.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:34:22.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
