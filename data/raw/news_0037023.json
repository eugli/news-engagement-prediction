Ironically, many of the journalists who cozied up to the Clinton campaign were from the Washington Post — Juliet Eilperin , Anne Gearan , Karen Tumulty — the same news outlet from which Podesta’s Trump hit piece was published.\nThe longtime Democratic operative also compared Trump’s handling of the media to that of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n“He is emulating the successful strategy of Vladimir Putin,” Podesta wrote , insisting that Trump’s media criticism puts America “in danger of experiencing an information void like Russia,” where citizens “hear something on TV and assume it’s a lie.”\nPodesta, of course, failed to mention his connections to Russia and Putin-connected companies .\nPodesta warns voters to “maintain a heightened vigilance” and says, “A heavy burden falls on American journalists to fact-check a president and a White House staff that is setting records for peddling false information and not to be afraid to call a lie, a lie.”\n“The recent ouster of Michael Flynn as national security adviser demonstrates that lying still carries consequences,” Podesta writes . “But they must go further and provide context and analysis for what motivates Trump, Stephen K. Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, and the others to constantly distort reality.”\nFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson\n Big Journalism , Pre-Viral , Anne Gearan , Big Government , big journalism , Donald Trump , fake news , Hillary Clinton , John Podesta , Juliet Eilperin , Karen Tumulty , KellyAnne Conway , Michael Flynn , pre-viral , Russia , Stephen K.
