Aldi has launched a luxury wine range starting at just £5 and you can grab one of the bargains NOW \nA table top fridge from the range will cost you £59.99 and has a 41 litre capacity with a 5 litre capacity ice box. Its dimensions are approximately 50 x 48 x 45cm. \nA similar mini fridge from LOGIK will cost £30 more. \nThe appliances are perfect for “rabbit hutch” homes as they fit into small spaces and can be stacked on top of other appliances. 5 Aldi’s table top fridge is 50 x 48 x 45cm and costs £59.99 \nTony Baines, managing director for corporate buying at Aldi said: “We appreciate that lots of homeowners and renters are pushed for space and not everyone needs or can accommodate full-sized kitchen items in the modern world. \n“Our compact living range responds to these changing consumer needs, offering city dwellers and space-savvy customers a selection of compact products and appliances which are great-value and don’t compromise on style.” 5 Aldi’s mini oven can be used for grilling, roasting and baking, while the electric compact hotplates can be used for frying and boiling. It costs £59.99 \nOther items from the range include a Dyson V6 handheld vacuum (£169.99), compact food processor (£13.99) and a mini fryer (£16.99). \nThe Dyson V6 is the most expensive item in the collection, but buying it from Aldi will save you more than £50 by comparison to other stores. \nCurrys and Argos are selling the very same vacuum for £129.99, while buying it directly from the manufacturer will cost £220. \nThe full Aldi compact living range is available online now, and in stores nationwide from Thursday. As with all Aldi Specialbuys, shoppers will have to be quick to snap up the range as they won’t be around for long. 5 The table top dishwasher is one of the more expensive appliances from the compact living range, retailing for £149.99 \nThe compact range will certainly come in handy for the new homeowners of one of London’s tiniest properties, which has gone on the market for the first time in 50 years – at almost almost three times the UK average price. \nThe pint-sized pad is just 8.5ft wide and has 290sq/ft of floor space, and is in need of a full renovation. Nevertheless, it’s on the market for a whopping £600,000 thanks to its enviable location in the middle of Chelsea. 5 The compact food processor is just 18 x 13 x 23cm and costs £13.99 \nWe pay for your stories!
