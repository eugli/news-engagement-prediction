Here’s a guide to this spring’s most promising live events, from Bette Midler’s star turn in “Hello, Dolly!,” to Chris Rock’s first standup tour in nearly a decade, to the Weeknd’s new North American jaunt. Feb. 23, 2016 4 Ways to Fall Down Laughing Photo Punxsutawney Phil, aka Raymond J. Lee, in transit. Credit Amy Lombard for The New York Times Relive ‘Groundhog Day’ \nRaymond J. Lee is overlooked when he wears his groundhog costume in rehearsals for “Groundhog Day,” a new musical based on the hit film that comes to Broadway this spring after a London run. Not because the design is demure; it stands about six-and-a-half-feet tall and would call for size 18s if groundhogs could wear sneakers. But at 5-foot-9, Mr. Lee has eyes sitting somewhere around the critter’s mouth. “Everyone looks up at the groundhog’s eyes,” he said. “I’m like, guys I’m right here.” \nThe groundhog pops up a few times during the musical, a time-warping romantic comedy about a frustrated weatherman, played by Andy Karl, who lives the same day over and over after reporting from Punxsutawney, Pa., on the weather-predicting groundhog Punxsutawney Phil. \nRob Howell, the show’s Tony Award-winning costume and set designer (“Matilda the Musical”) said he drew inspiration for the bushy suit during a trip to Punxsutawney. Mr. Howell was so taken with a man he saw dressed in a Phil get-up that he designed a homage of sorts, making sure not to make it look too jokey. \n“He’s there for selfies, and he’s handing out leaflets, and he’s probably miserable inside this thing,” Mr. Howell said. “But you’ll never know because he’s got his happy face on.” \nMr. Lee’s costume, which is repurposed from the show’s London run, is made of faux fur from top to toe, with “fancy spats,” as Mr. Howell put it, that cover the actor’s sneakers to resemble a paw. The head was sculpted in clay and vacuum-formed. The groundhog’s face is made of an open-weave fabric that helps Mr. Lee breathe, yet appears opaque under stage lights. \nMr. Howell is still at work on how to best keep Mr. Lee cool when costumed. One way would be to install cold packs inside a body suit that fits snugly against Mr. Lee. Tiny air vents can also help an actor’s body breathe. \nAlong with his time on stage as the groundhog (he’s also an ensemble member), Mr. Lee is likely to put on the fur in promotional appearances for the show. At a recent photo shoot in Central Park, children ran to the actor to give him hugs. \n“It’s automatic with this costume,” Mr. Lee said. “It just makes people happy.” \n–ERIK PIEPENBURG \nBegins performances March 16 at the August Wilson Theater; groundhogdaymusical.com . Photo The stretcher pratfall has two parts. In Act 1, two characters try to remove a dead body, but the canvas rips; the actors leave carrying only the poles, hoping no one will notice that the body is still there. Then, in Act II, there’s another stiff; the actors try to remove it using just the poles, but they struggle mightily to get through the door. Credit Andrew Testa for The New York Times ‘The Play That Goes Wrong’ Almost Went Really Wrong \nFires are no joke. But it seemed like the theater gods might be playing some kind of prank when flames broke out on Feb. 10 inside Broadway’s venerable Lyceum. \nThe theater’s next show is a British import, “The Play That Goes Wrong,” which is, as the title suggests, about a play that goes horribly wrong. The fire — happily minor — wasn’t part of the plan, but it allowed the producers to add a new calamity to their marketing plan: #BwayGoesWrong is setting the box office on fire, literally. Last night’s firefighting went right so that our play can go wrong. We ❤️ NYFD! pic.twitter.com/0WxU94N2FC — Play That Goes Wrong (@BwayGoesWrong) February 11, 2017 \nBut what makes “The Play That Goes Wrong” so funny that it has been running in London’s West End for more than two years, touring Britain, and produced in several other countries? So funny that one of America’s most successful film directors, J.J. Abrams, signed on as a co-producer to help bring it to Broadway? \nThe premise is simple — a troupe of actors (the Cornley Polytechnic Drama Society) is performing a murder mystery. But the group’s extremely earnest efforts at drama are repeatedly derailed by dropped lines, dropped props and dropped bodies — the play is a fiasco from beginning to end, though the characters are not in on the joke. It’s a classic farce, with a slapstick sensibility honed through improv. \n“For the material that gets the big laughs, the audience understands and knows fully what it would be if it goes right,” said Jonathan Sayer, who wrote the show with two college friends, Henry Lewis and Henry Shields. “It’s funny because tonally it cuts against what it should have been.” \n– MICHAEL PAULSON \nBegins performances March 9 at the Lyceum Theater; broadwaygoeswrong.com .

Mr. Rock will travel to more than 30 cities . \n–JASON ZINOMAN ON RELATIONSHIPS There is no equality in a relationship. You’re in a band. Someone sings lead and someone needs to plays the tambourine. ON BULLYING Bullies are the fertilizer to help good people grow. ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE You don’t want to be a black man in any court. Even a black judge brings his lawyer to court —just in case. Photo Father John Misty in 2015. Credit Kendrick Brinson for The New York Times Father John Misty Prepares a ‘Love Letter to Humanity’ \nTwo years ago, Father John Misty went viral by covering a Ryan Adams song, which was itself a cover of Taylor Swift’s “Blank Space.” This deadpan approach to irony imbues nearly every track on his new album, “Pure Comedy” (April 7). \nWhen this singer, born Joshua Tillman, is feeling generous, he refers to our species as “the world’s most soulful predators.” Which is why it comes as a surprise when Mr. Tillman describes the record as “a love letter to humanity.” “Life for humans is sort of a comedy of errors,” he said by phone. “That’s the thing that I love about humanity: our absurdity.” \nThe songs, written in 2015, were meant to be funny, but now, as Mr. Tillman prepares to release them into a changed world, the big fear is that audiences for his spring tour will no longer be as willing to laugh: “People are really angry right now, and they’re more likely to take these songs maybe a little too literally.” \nThen again, even though Father John Misty shows are known for their acerbic and self-aware, off-the-cuff stage banter, Mr. Tillman admits that when he finally returns to the stage, he may not be able to laugh much himself. “It’s going to be hard not to cry when I sing ‘Each other’s all we’ve got,’” he said, quoting the last line of the new album’s title track . \nThen, in telling fashion, even this becomes a joke. “I’ll probably be bringing a lot more crying to my shows,” he continued. “And tear cannons. Just showering the audience with tears. It will be like going to see Shamu or something.” (It will probably still be very funny.) \n–NICK MURRAY \nFather John Misty is scheduled to appear at Coachella, which runs from April 14 to 23. 4 Ways to Cry Your Eyes Out Photo January LaVoy and Michael Emerson in \"Wakey, Wakey,\" the new play from Will Eno. Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times Wonder, and Weep, With Will Eno \n“Is it now? I thought I had more time.” Those are the opening lines of “Wakey, Wakey,” Will Eno’s new play which invites us to commiserate with a wry everyman as he narrates his own passing. Yet like much of Mr. Eno’s work ( “The Realistic Joneses” ), the play promises to lace the sadness with unexpected flashes of joy. (“We’re not here to mope, right?” the man continues. “We’re here to listen to music and drink some grape juice, maybe get a free T-shirt.”) \nSo what makes Mr. Eno cry? Here are five things that came to his mind when recently asked: Chad Batka for The New York Times 1. Recent photographs of children in war and refugee crises: Alan Kurdi, Omran Daqneesh, and others. These are different, in kind and degree, from anything else I could list. Most people were overwhelmed by the intensity of the violence compared to the smallness of the children in the pictures, their Snoopy sweatshirts and the little clothes. I’m sure we’re all still trying to convert our shock and sadness into action and care. 2. My grandmother dying, trying to tell us about this thing she kept seeing. She was 102 and kept telling everyone about these tiny little men who would march past her window with a brightly colored flag. I didn’t know then that dying people are often trying to tell us something very specific, but in a metaphorical way. After all her years of listening, to grandchildren and great-grandchildren, I wish I had listened better then, and had asked her more about what she saw, so that she might have felt heard and understood. 3. A young kid sings the national anthem at a minor-league baseball game. I love that feeling of everyone in the place wanting it to go well, but the whole responsibility, the lonely effort to put all that feeling and pride and hope into one song, rests with the kid at the mic, alone near home plate. Those final difficult notes sometimes come right when a person’s confidence is riding highest and it’s such a thrill, that feeling of something being close to ending and you can’t wait to clap for it. You want it to last, you want it to be over and have gone well, and it all means the game is about to start, so it’s a pretty moving moment. 4. The Red Sox winning the 2004 World Series That was just an amazing feeling, or end of pent-up feelings, for Sox fans. Incredibly personal and small at the same time it was grand and historical. I felt some version of it when the Cubs won in 2016, too. 5. The Monday Stominy Cub This is how our daughter, who’s two and a half, says “The Monday Astronomy Club,” which is what we called it when we went outside to look at the moon last Monday. Compared to all of the known astronomical science and to the immense mystery of the universe, the difference between what she knows and what I know about astronomy is not that big. I can pronounce certain words, sure, but I stand beneath the deep, dark sky in roughly the same ignorance and awe. \n–WILL ENO \n“Wakey, Wakey” opens Feb. 27 at the Signature Theater Center; signaturetheatre.org . Photo Prince, in concert in 1985. Credit Associated Press Remember Prince With the Revolution \nApril 21 is the anniversary of Prince’s death. There are many ways to celebrate his remarkable career: listening to his music on all major streaming services for the first time , visiting the museum at his Paisley Park compound in Minnesota. But there’s only one option if you want to shed purple tears while hearing the band Prince formed in 1979 play some of his most beloved songs: The Revolution is going on tour. \nThe Revolution backed Prince on several albums, including “Purple Rain,” and its current lineup — Lisa Coleman, Matt Fink (who’s called Dr.), Wendy Melvoin, Mark Brown (a.k.a. Brownmark) and Bobby Rivkin (known as Bobby Z) — played three memorial shows in September at the Minneapolis club First Avenue, where parts of the movie were filmed. Most of the group’s members (and a host of guests) took the mike at the memorials, which included songs likely to make the cut on tour: “Let’s Go Crazy,” “1999,” “Raspberry Beret” and, of course, “When Doves Cry.” \n–NICK MURRAY \nThe tour starts at Paisley Park on April 20 and 21, and comes to B.B. King’s in New York on April 28 and Webster Hall on May 3. Photo Irene Sankoff and David Hein Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times ‘Come From Away’: A Tale of Kindness — Newfoundland-Style — on 9/11 \nIrene Sankoff and David Hein had planned to get married in 2002. But the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, made them reconsider their long engagement: What were they waiting for? \nSo on Oct. 12, 2001, they hopped on the subway and rode down to City Hall in Lower Manhattan; they passed the armed soldiers and the military jeeps and the words “Heroes Live Forever” written in dust on a storefront. And, with one cousin as their witness, they eloped. \nAsserting love and community in the aftermath of horror was an impulse move. But now, 16 years later, it is the theme of their emotional musical, “ Come From Away ,” which tells the little-known (to Americans) story of a city in Newfoundland that in the days after the terrorist attacks sheltered thousands of air passengers whose flights had been grounded. \nThe musical is lively — powered by a Newfoundland folk rock score — and funny; the culture clashes are mined for all they’re worth. But invariably audiences cry, not only because of the persistent power of that day (which is not depicted in the show), but also, surprisingly, because watching human beings be generous to frightened strangers (and the show is largely about hospitality) seems to induce tears. \n“We see it so rarely that it’s almost shocking,” Ms. Sankoff said. “We are so used to the appallingly shocking, the disturbingly shocking, that to see something that is refreshingly openhearted and good-natured and just done to make someone else’s life easier — you never see that, and I think people are shocked by that.” \nThe musical’s arrival on Broadway is somewhat remarkable — it is just the second show ever by Ms. Sankoff and Mr. Hein, who wrote the music, lyrics and book. Ms. Sankoff, raised on movie musicals in Toronto, wanted to be an actor and a dancer, while Mr. Hein, raised on folk festivals and roots rock in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, wanted to be a singer-songwriter. They decided to try writing shows so they could spend more time together, and their first collaboration, a musical about his family called “My Mother’s Lesbian Jewish Wiccan Wedding,” became a Toronto fringe festival hit . (The couple not only wrote that show but also starred in it.) \nThen Michael Rubinoff , a theater producer trying to jump-start Canadian musical theater , gave them an idea, which several more experienced writers had turned down: How about taking a look back at what had happened in Gander, Newfoundland? \nThe resultant show has had a circuitous (and buzz-building) path to Broadway — developmental stagings at Sheridan College near Toronto, festivals at Goodspeed Musicals in Connecticut and the National Alliance for Musical Theater in New York, and productions at the La Jolla Playhouse , Seattle Repertory Theater , Ford’s Theater in Washington, and the Royal Alexandra Theater in Toronto. The entire cast and crew even flew to Gander last fall to perform the songs in a hockey arena so Newfoundlanders would have a chance to see how they were being depicted. \nThe creative team has used the opportunity presented by having multiple pre-Broadway productions to fine-tune the emotional arc, and impact, of the story — making sure the pathos is balanced with laughter, and with hope. \n“We’ve been very careful crafting it to make a safe space,” Mr. Hein said. “If you’re worried about this, don’t worry about it. Come to Newfoundland with us, where we’re going to tell a story.” \nTheater, of course, is seen through the prism of the time in which it is staged. The onset of the Trump administration, with its skepticism about immigrants and refugees, is likely to shift the way “Come From Away” is perceived, making it feel less about the aftermath of a terrorism attack and more about the welcoming of foreigners. \n“It is a story about Americans as refugees, which is an interesting thing that Americans don’t have to deal with very often,” said the show’s director, Christopher Ashley, who is also the artistic director of the La Jolla Playhouse. “Everyone working on the show feels lucky at this moment to be telling a story about generosity.” \n–MICHAEL PAULSON \nNow in previews, and opens March 12 at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater; comefromaway.com . Photo Jews being escorted from the Warsaw Ghetto by German soldiers in 1943. Credit Associated Press Be Humbled by the ‘Joy’ of Beethoven \nThe “Ode to Joy” at the end of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, which Alan Gilbert and the New York Philharmonic will be playing in five performances in May, stirs you even when you listen to it at home, alone. But there is something about hearing it live, surrounded by a few thousand others, that takes it from hummable to heart-wrenching. Suddenly the “millions” that the text describes embracing are all around you; the “world” that the chorus addresses is right there in the hall. \nEven if you’ve heard this famous melody dozens of times before, I dare you not to crumble. It could hardly be a more tense, divisive time, and no one expects Beethoven to solve anything. But his earnest vision of all people uniting is one that could, especially now, bring tears. \nMr. Gilbert is pairing it with Schoenberg’s raw, bristling “Survivor From Warsaw,” with a simmering orchestra over which a narrator gives an intense spoken account of suffering in the Holocaust. The work concludes with a passionate setting of “Sh’ma Yisrael,” the prayer at the center of Jewish belief. For this music to lead directly into the roiling darkness and gleaming light of Beethoven’s Ninth will be an experience of rare power. \n– ZACHARY WOOLFE \nMay 3 to 9, David Geffen Hall . 4 Ways to Bow in the Presence of Greatness Photo Bette Midler at Madison Square Garden in 2015. Credit Chad Batka for The New York Times Be Dazzled by Bette Midler \nSometimes an actress and a role seem so fated to come together on Broadway that if they don’t, choirs of angels weep might-have-been tears. So delighted cries were heard that a match had been struck in heaven when it was learned that Bette Midler would be appearing as the American musical’s favorite matchmaker. That’s the singing steamroller Dolly Levi in Jerry Herman and Michael Stewart’s “Hello, Dolly!,” a show that has been a diva’s delight since Carol Channing created the part 53 years ago. Ms. Midler is fabled for the Dolly-ish virtues of chutzpah, warmth, vocal brass, stage-filling presence and a way with the boys. So bring on the dancing waiters. Bette’s back where she belongs. \n–BEN BRANTLEY \nPerformances begin March 15 at the Shubert Theater, hellodollyonbroadway.com . In ‘War Paint,’ a Sing-Off Between Patti LuPone and Christine Ebersole \nIt’s a sing-off that “The Voice” could only dream of: Patti LuPone and Christine Ebersole going mano a mano (or rather, larynx a larynx) on the same stage. Ms. LuPone and Ms. Ebersole are great musical stars of roughly the same age and wattage, but their vocal styles are as different of those of Ethel Merman and Mary Martin (to summon their equivalents of an earlier generation). So imagine the sparks — and the decibels and the perfume bottles and the false eyelashes — that should fly when they play battling cosmetic titans in “War Paint,” the new bio-musical by Doug Wright, Scott Frankel and Michael Korie about Helena Rubinstein (Ms. LuPone) and Elizabeth Arden (Ms. Ebersole). \n–BEN BRANTLEY \nPerformances begin March 7 at the Nederlander Theater, warpaintmusical.com . Diana Vishneva’s Farewell Ballet Performance Diana Vishneva Oleg Zotov \nFarewell performances can have a surreal side: How can we come to terms with a final bow? That sentiment is even more acute when considering the inimitable Diana Vishneva , 40, who will step down as a principal with American Ballet Theater on June 23. Ever since this sultry, stylish Russian ballerina, revered for her plasticity and daring, made her New York debut in 1997 at a gala celebrating Diaghilev — becoming a principal with Ballet Theater in 2005 — she has entranced audiences with her glamour and expressiveness. Movement just about melts off her body, so it’s fitting that she has chosen a passionate role that she can really sink her pointe shoes into: Tatiana in John Cranko’s stirring “Onegin.” \n–GIA KOURLAS \nJune 19, 23; Metropolitan Opera House; abt.org . Renée Fleming Bids Farewell to Major Roles at the Met Renee Fleming Damon Winter/The New York Times \nRarely has a singer, a role, an opera house and a moment come together as they will this spring, when the soprano Renée Fleming bids farewell to major roles at the Metropolitan Opera in a new production of one of her signature pieces: Strauss’s “Der Rosenkavalier.” The Met has been Ms. Fleming’s home going back to 1988, when she was a winner of its National Council Auditions. Nearly 250 performances later — among them gorgeous evenings of Mozart, Verdi, Strauss and Tchaikovsky (an urgent, autumnal “Eugene Onegin”) — she is moving ever more into music administration and slowly leaving the stage behind. She says auf wiedersehen with a work tailor-made for the occasion: Witty and nostalgic, half-grinning and half-crying, “Rosenkavalier” is about an aristocrat whose younger lover falls for a girl his own age — and also about a star singer saying goodbye. \n–ZACHARY WOOLFE \nPerformances begin April 13 and run through May 13, Metropolitan Opera House. 2 Ways to Channel Your Anger Photo Bobby Cannavale will play Yank in Eugene O’Neill’s “The Hairy Ape.” Credit Scott McIntyre for The New York Times Feel His Fury: Bobby Cannavale \nFor months, the actor Bobby Cannavale has pestered the people in his life: What does belonging mean to them, and where do they feel they belong? \n“Even the most misanthropic people, they’ll give you an answer,” he said one February afternoon from Miami, where he was visiting family. \nWhat he’s been trying to put his finger on is what a person loses when his sense of belonging disappears — a key, he thinks, to unlocking his next role: Yank, the furious, disillusioned, coal-stoking laborer at the center of Eugene O’Neill’s “ The Hairy Ape ” (1922), beginning a limited run on March 25 at the Park Avenue Armory. \n“Because when you lose something, what do you do?” Mr. Cannavale asked. “You do everything you can to try to reclaim it.” \nRichard Jones, the production’s Olivier Award-winning director, said the show’s success is “all about the lead actor, really.” When Mr. Jones staged it at the Old Vic Theater in London in 2015, Bertie Carvel (“Matilda the Musical”) was his Yank. But for New York, who better to personify O’Neill’s wounded brute than Mr. Cannavale? \nA Tony nominee for “ The With the Hat ” a few seasons back, and more recently the star of the HBO series “Vinyl,” he specializes in handsome, unpolished types. Though he first read “The Hairy Ape” in his 20s, Mr. Cannavale, 46, has never done an O’Neill play before. Yet O’Neill’s dense, phonetically written dialogue — packed with words like “youse” and “skoit” (skirt, that is: a woman) — feels natural to Mr. Cannavale. “It reads to me very much like music,” he said. “It’s quite gorgeous, I think.” \nYank is a tough guy among tough guys, and on the ocean liner where he feeds the furnace to keep the ship moving, he has a proud and romantic vision of the importance of his role. But when a wealthy young passenger comes across him on a visit to the stokehole, Yank recognizes her horror. “Oh, the filthy beast!” she says, and faints. Yet Yank is the one who reels, in an instant losing his sense of where he fits in the world. Convinced that she looked at him as if he were a hairy ape, he vows revenge. \nAt the Old Vic, Mr. Jones’s stylized production played out on a proscenium stage, but in the armory’s vast Drill Hall, the set will revolve around the audience on something like a giant conveyor belt. The cast is new, too, with just one holdover from London: Phil Hill, who plays the gorilla in the final scene. (“The costume was £5,000, and it only fits him,” Mr. Jones said.) \nMr. Cannavale doesn’t much need to concern himself with the play’s expressionism; the choreography will mostly occur around him. Mr. Jones has instructed him to approach the role realistically. \nThe setup is real enough to him, anyway. He has long traveled in glamorous circles — his ex-wife is the screenwriter Jenny Lumet, whose father was the director Sidney Lumet, and Mr. Cannavale is engaged to the actress Rose Byrne — but he grew up working class. It isn’t hard for him to note parallels between Yank’s situation and what he has known in his own family. \nAnd it has not escaped him that Yank’s drama will unfold on the Upper East Side. \n“It’s almost like the armory itself is the ship that he’s working on,” Mr. Cannavale said. “He says: ‘What do them slobs in the first cabin got to do with us? One of us guys could take the whole mob with one mitt. Put one of them down here for one watch in the stokehole, what’d happen? They’d carry him off on a stretcher.’ You could say the same thing about the people that are sitting in the audience.” \n–LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES \nBegins performances March 25 at the Park Avenue Armory, armoryonpark.org .

Then came “American Idiot,” th is California band’s ambit i ous 2004 volley against President George W. Bush and the Iraq war, and “21st Century Breakdown,” a second rock-opera-style album about post-Bush angst, five years later. \nThe group took a lengthy break from political punk, but returned in October with its 12th studio album, “Revolution Radio,” another ferocious batch of songs about anxious protagonists in an uncertain world. “It’s not that I’m Nostradamus or anything like that, but we knew something different was going to happen,” the band’s singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong said. “Our gigs almost feel like political rallies — plus the craziest party you’ve ever been to.” \nGreen Day, which played its first show in 1987, began this year with a brief tour through Europe, where Mr. Armstrong doubled down on the protest vibe by singing certain lyrics through a megaphone. The set list has been heavy on “American Idiot,” whose title track is recharged by audience reactions to Donald J. Trump’s presidency. “Playing that song has been pretty intense,” Mr. Armstrong said. “The way people react, you can see there’s a lot of anger brewing.” \n–NICK MURRAY \nGreen Day’s arena tour begins March 1 in Phoenix and comes to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on March 15. 3 Ways to Bathe in Nostalgia Photo Credit Patrick Burns/The New York Times The Met Opera Celebrates Its Grand, Old Home \nOpera is always at least a little nostalgic. But the reveries will be more powerful than usual this spring when the Metropolitan Opera celebrates a milestone: the 50th anniversary of its red-carpeted, golden-chandeliered, dramatically staircased home at Lincoln Center. e \nPlácido Domingo, Anna Netrebko, Renée Fleming and many others will perform at a gala concert on May 7, singing selections from great moments of the opera house’s past. \nThe “New Met” opened on Sept. 16, 1966, “a brightly lighted architectural toy,” the Times reported at the time. The audience included Lady Bird Johnson and “hundreds of formally dressed tycooons, aristocrats, nabobs, bankers, moguls, diplomats, potentates, fashion plates, grande dames and other assorted Great Society over-achievers.” \nAnd the opera? Leontyne Pryce starred in the premiere of Samuel Barber’s “Antony and Cleopatra.” Justino Díaz and Rosalind Elias performed with the grand dame, and in these edited interviews, they talked about that night. Leontyne Price starred in Samuel Barber’s “Antony and Cleopatra” at the Metropolitan Opera. Larry C. Morris/The New York Times \nJUSTINO DÍAZ I have never stopped thinking about that night. The glamour, the glitz. The opera house was the showcase; the opera was secondary. But Leontyne was one of the five or six vocal miracles that I have ever heard in my life. To be on stage with her, two feet away, and feeling those vibrations touch you, time stopped for me. \nThe acoustics were wonderful. I love that the voice came back to you, that you had feedback, which makes it easier to sing piano, or mezzo forte, even if at the Met you never see the back wall. At La Scala, it’s like singing into a pillowcase. \nThe day of the opening, I was focused on my routine, getting up and getting breakfast. Having lunch, because then I wouldn’t eat until after the performance in those days. I was concentrating on my lines and going over the music. After it was over, there was a supper in the lobby, and there were so many people that I couldn’t get close enough to see the dignitaries. Maybe they didn’t even come. \nROSALIND ELIAS It does seem like yesterday. Every name was in the audience — the Kennedys, Rockefellers, everyone was there. \nThe technology of the new theater was phenomenal, and of course, it didn’t work in any of the rehearsals. We would get stuck, Leontyne and I, in the pyramid. The mechanics were so new that they weren’t working, up to and including the dress rehearsal. But somehow, everything went smoothly opening night. \nThere was a big party, as usual. Everybody had a good time, got a little high; there was lots of champagne. The theater is lovely, of course, and it was even lovelier then because we’d not seen an entrance like that. And people were on the staircase having photos taken, and it was such an honor to be a part of it. \nThose days were just wonderful. The house was like a family. The cast was together, helping each other. It was like when I first came to New York and wanted to make a career in music: It was brand new. \n–ZACHARY WOOLFE The Different Flavors of the Same Candy Man \n“And what an extraordinary little man he was!” \nFifty-three years ago, Roald Dahl introduced Willy Wonka to the world, an ebullient and eccentric candymaker who Dahl described as “the greatest inventor and maker of chocolates that there has ever been” in the now beloved children’s book, “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” \nIn the years since, screen and stage actors have donned the top hat to bring Wonka to life, portraying him in a variety of ways — some charming, some creepy, some a mix of both. This spring, a new musical adaptation of “Charlie,” significantly reworked after playing to mixed reviews in London, arrives on Broadway, with Christian Borle leading the American cast as the kooky chocolatier. As the character is reimagined, once again, for theater’s biggest stage, here’s a look at Wonkas old and new, in terms he might well understand.
