For some it will be a festival of football, for others it will be a festival of violence. \n“Our opponents are the English, the forefathers of hooliganism. We are awaiting them. If you are there you should calculate getting your a*** kicked.” Read More This World: Russia's Hooligan Army talks to the Orel Butchers, supporters of Orel, a team in the 3rd division of Russian football (Photo: BBC) The gang members are looking forward to the World Cup as a 'festival of violence' (Photo: BBC) The yobs in action (Photo: BBC) \nAt the Euros last June, dozens of England fans were injured, some nearly fatally, after being ambushed by squads of Russian thugs in military-style attacks in Marseilles, France, the day the two sides played . The violence prompted an inquiry into the threat posed by gangs at the World Cup in Russia. \nSpeaking on the BBC2 documentary, Russia’s Hooligan Army, which airs tonight, the ringleader of the Orel Butchers, a semi-professional martial arts fighter called Denis, hides behind a balaclava as he boasts of his attacks.

It was like 200 professionals fighting 2,000 amateurs. \n“I hit a guy in the head. There was a British guy in a coma. I was thinking, ‘I bet that’s my guy because I really hit him properly’.” Spartak Moscow fans inside the stadium during the derby against CSKA Moscow (Photo: BBC) \nUnlike the lager louts who give England fans a bad name, these Russian hooligans are sober, muscular, and well drilled. The night before a fight they gather at a sauna to bond and feast on freshly caught crayfish to ensure they are in peak physical and mental condition the next day. \nOne said: “I don’t see anything bad in this. Some collect stamps, some like mountain hiking, some collect cars. We fight. I think it is better than drinking alcohol, smoking, or taking drugs.” \nThese gangs are also auditioning new members ready for the World Cup, taking them deep into the forest to fight hooligans from rival firms to prove themselves.

The victors earn a place in the firm and the right to have their tattoo emblazoned on their skin. \nThere is only one rule. “Do not kill, that’s it,” one of the organisers explained. \nThe violence is sickening. When one rookie is knocked to the ground a rival repeatedly stamps on his skull as he desperately tries to protect his head. It is a miracle no-one is seriously hurt.

Gang veterans see them as fun and travel for miles to take part in clashes involving up to 200 hooligans, often in frozen fields knee-deep in snow. \nTheir aim is clear. “Why do we fight the English? We are seeking pride,” says Denis. \n“There was a time people thought of Russians as vodka, folk guitar and furry boots. That has gone now. I like the fact I am Russian and people think we are the tough guys.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:07:01.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
