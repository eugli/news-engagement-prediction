But according to one commercial, Brady seemed to know the result before the game even happened. \nBrady had previously filmed a commercial for Shields Health Care in which his four Super Bowl rings are locked in a locker for protection. When the attendant asked Brady if that was all, he humorously answered, “for now.” \nWell, “for now,” didn’t take long. Almost immediately after the latest Super Bowl win, Shields released an updated version of the commercial in which Brady adds a fifth ring. This time, Brady answers, “actually no, I forgot this one, it is kind of new.” \nBrilliant! \nClearly this was filmed prior to the Super Bowl. In fact, this alternate ending may have been filmed when the original was shot. A true act of confidence!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:11:39.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
