But Helin is not afraid. \n“Malmö’s not dangerous,” she told us yesterday, as she arrived in the city to film the final series of The Bridge, in which she plays homicide detective Saga Norén. \n“We have refugees,” she said. “These people are traumatised and scared. If there weren’t problems it would be strange. But they add to the community.” Helin is “grateful” for migrant hospital workers, who “do jobs that we don’t want to do”. \nHelin thinks Norén would agree. “I think she would be rational about it — ‘I don’t think this is a dangerous city’ is probably what she would say. \n“The bridge [from Malmö to Copenhagen] is beautiful. It has a roughness to it. You’ve got to visit!” \nWe’re sold. \nFor all of today's Diary click here . \nFollow The Londoner on Twitter and Facebook here.
