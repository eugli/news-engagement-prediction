And then you've got the everyday weirdness of life in the Trump era.\" \nMeyers spent the next 10 minutes on just the most recent Trump events – from having his national security adviser resign amid allegations of collusion with Russian officials, his proposed replacement passing on the job , and that strange press conference . Then there was the confusion Trump caused after seeming to suggest there was a terrorist attack in Sweden (there wasn't). \n\" As he does so often, Trump transitioned seamlessly from claiming the media makes up fake stories to making up his own fake stories,\" Meyers said. \nDuring a rally on Saturday   Trump defended his travel ban by rattling off countries where terrorist attacks were carried out by refugees, and mentioned Sweden. \n\"You look at what's happening last night in Sweden,\" Trump said . \"Sweden, who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers [of refugees]. They're having problems like they never thought possible.\" \nSweden's embassy tweeted, \" Unclear to us what President Trump was referring to.
