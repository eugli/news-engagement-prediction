You might be in the \"you know wrestling is fake camp\" and whilst that makes me want to rip your head off you'd be hard pressed to argue that a man who can get burnt for realsies and then wrestle a match is hard as all hell! \nThe Undertaker is the ultimate figure in proving just how ridiculous the world of sports entertainment is and just how physically difficult it is in equal measure. \nSince joining the WWE in 1990 'Taker' has been buried alive several times, been set on fire whilst inside a casket on multiple occasions, fought against himself in the ring, battled his brother and drowned his dad in cement and stayed close with both of them. \nAll this whilst we've been told to believe that he is an undertaker, is dead, undead, unkillable and alive almost all at the same time! All utterly farcical. \nBut if you want proof that he is a legitimate tough guy then you need only go back in time to seven years ago today and the 2010 Elimination Chamber match where the 'Deadman' was genuinely and accidentally set on fire! \nHeading into the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view in February 2010 he was the World Heavyweight Champion and had to go through five other men to retain his title and go on to Wrestlemania. \nBut before the match could even start, before Taker got to the ring, he was burned by his own pyrotechnics and the fire at the top of the ramp going off at the wrong time: \n(Credit: YouTube ) \nWWE obviously didn't show one of their main performers get burned live on air and Taker clearly deals with the whole situation very well before going to stand inside his 'pod' for a while. \nDuring the show the Demon of Death Valley could be seen pouring bottles of cold water on his neck and chest area before he went out to wrestle with first and second degree burns. \nTaker would go on to lose after interference from Shawn Michaels, a moment that would lead to their Wrestlemania rematch at the same event a year on. \nSure wrestling's fake but how many people get burned and then do their job?!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:04:59.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
