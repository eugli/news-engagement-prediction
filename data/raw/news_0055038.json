Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJose Mourinho has backed Bastian Schweinsteiger and Marouane Fellaini to fill the void left behind by the injured duo Michael Carrick and Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the EFL Cup final. \nThe Manchester United pair picked up knocks in their side's 4-0 aggregate win over St Etienne in the second leg of their Europa League last 16 tie on Wednesday. \nMkhitaryan, who scored the only goal of the encounter, hobbled off with an apparent hamstring injury in just 25 minutes and was replaced by Marcus Rashford. \nWhile Carrick suffered a calf injury and made way for Schweinsteiger with half-an-hour of the game left to play.

Mourinho has given Fellaini a vote of confidence ahead of Sunday (Photo: REUTERS) \n\"Obviously they are important players for us and not to have them both for the final is complicated. \n\"But I think Marouane [Fellaini] and Bastian [Schweinsteiger] - two players who are normally not playing too much - is a good answer. \n\"I don't say they are definitely out. I just say what I feel. Hamstring or calf, I always think three days is no time.\" poll loading Will Manchester United win the Europa League this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:48:25.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
