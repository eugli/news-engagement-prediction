The cards will come in 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB capacities, promising write speeds of up to 299 megabytes per second and read speeds of up to 300MB/s.\nThere's no word on pricing, but we’re guessing it’ll be expensive at first. As is typical for high performance SD cards, Sony is aiming this product at the photography market. The SD cards are ideal for hi-speed continuous shooting of high-resolution images for UHS-II supporting cameras and 4K video, according to Sony. The company says its algorithm helps prevent the card’s data-writing speed from decreasing during use for continuous shooting.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:12:34.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
