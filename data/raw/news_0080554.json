I kept muttering 'nah, nah' as I saw each number – then I saw I had the right Powerball number and then I knew I was in trouble.\" \nShe was so stunned she called her son to double-check, and her son was so shocked he woke his girlfriend up to confirm his mother's winnings. \n\"I blearily checked the numbers – they were all there. I honestly thought I was still dreaming – she's a hardworking single mum, so this really is the kind of thing you dream of someone like her winning,\" he said. Ad Feedback \nThe winner says her top priorities for the money are paying off the mortgage and buying herself a new fridge. \n\"I'm not too sure what else I'll do to be honest, I just know I want to do some good.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:02:37.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
