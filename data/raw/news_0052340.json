When Thomas Romero and Nina Crawford, were arrested for changing price tags they told police they had a dog in their car.

Sure enough, he was basically suffering from a heroin overdose.” \nThe tiny 4-month-old Chihuahua mix was rushed to veterinarian Stacie Fowler desperately clinging to life and on “the verge of not breathing”. \n“If he’d not received treatment he would’ve stopped breathing,” Fowler said. \nAfter recovering from the opiate overdose the dog was brought to Carrollton animal services where staff named him, appropriately, ‘Lucky’ . \nCarrollton police thanked the veterinarian and her colleagues for saving the young pup in a post on their Facebook page. \nThe dog’s owners face charges of possession of a controlled substance/heroin and fraudulent destruction, removal or concealment of writing. They have 10 days to claim ‘Lucky’ . After that, the pooch will go up for adoption.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:04:07.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
