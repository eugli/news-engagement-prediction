(AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) Photo: Evan Vucci \n\"Her quest to float along, empowered but unsullied, beside her father throughout his increasingly ugly campaign has been getting harder and harder,\" wrote Talbot at the time. \nThe decision by retailers to remove the Ivanka Trump brand from online and stores (Nordstrom announced that they will no longer carry the line, but will sell out remaining stock, and Neiman Marcus removed the brand's products from its online store) was said to be based on declining sales. \nBut the decision follows the grassroots campaign called Grab Your Wallet , which called for shoppers to boycott the brands that carried Ivanka and Donald Trump merchandise. As Axios noted , customers have commented on Macy's social feeds asking for them to take similar actions as Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus. \nDespite this, a representative from Ivanka Trump's brand (from which Ivanka is said to be stepping away from ), told Business Insider that business was still good. What's more, that the brand was maintaining its \"integrity.\" Advertisement \n\"The women behind the brand represent a diverse group of professionals and we are proud to say that the Ivanka Trump brand continues to embody the principles upon which it was founded. It is a company built to inspire women with solution-oriented offerings, created to celebrate and service the many aspects of their lives,\" said Rosemary K. Young, Ivanka Trump's senior director of marketing, in the statement to Business Insider on Friday afternoon. \nYet, according to a recent poll less than 1 in 4 women would buy an Ivanka-branded item. It must be said though that Fortune notes , Google search interest in the brand has remained steady, and the time that she tweeted a link to the dress that she wore during the Republican convention it sold out within an hour. \nThe boycott isn't something that Trump is too worried about, telling Good Morning America , that people can make up their own minds and that she has always advocated for women. \n\"Well, the beauty of America is people can do what they like, but I prefer to talk to the millions, tens of millions of American women who are inspired by the brand and the message that I've created,\" Ivanka said. \n\"I never politicised that message,\" Ivanka added. \"People who are seeking to politicise it because they may disagree with the politics of my father, there's nothing I can do to change that.\" It is perhaps interesting, then, that Chelsea Clinton, another daughter of a president (and a would-be president) has decided to start politicising her own message/\"brand\". \nThe thing is though, Anne Helen Peterson said of Ivanka in Buzzfeed , just like her father, Ivanka turned her lifestyle into a brand. And boy, that 'messaging' can get tricky. \n\"[Ivanka Trump] grew up in a world textured not just by Trump, and his understanding of capitalism and patriarchy, but postfeminism and its cool new stepsister, commodity feminism . She doesn't just embody those ideologies; she wins them. No one is better at suggesting that purchasing clothing is the same as empowerment — and, as such, no one should make more money from that (flawed) principle.\" \nSo what happens when that idea of empowerment doesn't sell? Or your clothes are hugely discounted? Or when you've sold yourself on being the liberal counterpart to your father? Well, then you get a backlash when you post an ill-timed social post of yourself headed to a fancy event on the night that your father has just caused chaos at the airport with an executive order travel ban. But it also means that you claw back some kudos for helping to rollback an executive order that would have scrapped Obama-era LGBT protections . Yet the reactions on Twitter have been mixed, and there have been reports that the order wasn't ever really in play . As Andrew Solomon wrote in The New Yorker , being gay in America feels different than it did just a few months ago. Dear LGBTQ media: As long as @IvankaTrump keeps working for her father—which she is in all but name only—she is not our friend. — Gabe Ortíz (@TUSK81) February 4, 2017 \nIt would seem that not everybody is buying it. And also, that it's not so easy to re-brand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:34:22.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
