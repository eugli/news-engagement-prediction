Ab jetzt zum Download und ab morgen im Laden erhältlich: https://t.co/qv6ihBqCQm pic.twitter.com/xtfI9YL2yW \n— DER SPIEGEL (@DerSPIEGEL) February 3, 2017 The Washington Post reports that the illustration was done by Cuban American freelancer Edel Rodriguez , who came to the U.S. as a political refugee in 1980 when he was 9 years old. And yes, the parallel with ISIS was intentional, according to Rodriguez, who told the Post that the image represents a “beheading of democracy” and that “both sides are extremists, so I’m just making a comparison between them.”\nIt’s not the first time Trump has beheaded Lady Liberty on the cover of a publication, either — The Daily News went there a year ago.\nRodriguez, who Ad Week celebrated as one of last year’s most creative people, also illustrated TIME ’s epic Trump Meltdown covers in August and October, as well a whole bunch of other Trump images and another striking Der Spiegel cover from right after the election:\nThe new @DerSPIEGEL cover story on Trump's election will be online in English this evening (European time). pic.twitter.com/OKNYPXZgtD \n— SPIEGEL English (@SPIEGEL_English) November 11, 2016 Meanwhile, The Economist ’s new cover , featuring stencil art by British illustrator Miles Donovan , casts Trump in a more anarchist light:\nThis week's cover of @TheEconomist .
