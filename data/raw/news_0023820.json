Burns. He's to be installed this week as the eighth Bishop of Dallas. Appointed by Pope Francis, he comes to us originally from Pittsburgh, but more immediately from Juneau, having served as bishop there since 2009. \nThe worst I can say about him is that he's a Steelers fan, but even in that I'm just grateful he isn't from Philadelphia. I don't think we'd be able to handle someone who rooted for the Eagles. (Charity this side of heaven does have limits.) In all honesty, he's a good man. I've met him, spent a little time with him. I think you'll like him. He's downright friendly and affable in that western Pennsylvania sort of way. \nBut why should you care, especially if you're not Catholic? Because as Bishop of Dallas, he's automatically a significant player and voice in this city and beyond. Overseeing a diocese of more than 1 million Catholics in nine counties, as well as 36 schools educating around 15,000 diverse students; overseeing also organizations such as Catholic Charities of Dallas, one of the largest social service providers in the city, Bishop Burns takes up one of the broadest and most challenging leadership positions in Dallas. Trump was right, we were wrong — and we need to understand why \nWhich is why it's important that he's a good man and capable. And I believe he is. Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the prior bishop of Dallas, transformed the Catholic and religious life of this city for the better. The Catholic church underneath his leadership established its role in Dallas and beyond as a servant of the people â of all people of any faith or none, serving those in need, not because they're Catholic, he always said, but because we are. This is the legacy still alive among Catholics in this city. And it's a legacy this new bishop can build upon, bringing his own new gifts and personality. \nOf course, I'm biased. I'm a Catholic and a priest, and so I'm by no means neutral in my estimation or my hope. Nonetheless, I still think it important for all of us, not just for folks like me. And that's because I believe in the good of truly diverse pluralism. I believe such pluralism necessary for the broader democratic good of our common public square.

It's a city in which I may grow under the wisdom of the Torah as well as the insights of the Hadith, sanctified in the teachings of Jesus as well as enlightened by the precise beauties of science. A city in which these voices come together as one chorus, not in any sort of tired blurred syncretism, but truly symphonic. A city in which each person keeps his or her authentic faith and authentic voice, speaking and bearing witness to it peacefully; each sharing the wisdom and insights of his or her traditions for the good of all. A truly diverse city: this is my vision, my hope and my prayer. Secretive Baylor regents contribute to spiraling crisis \nAnd I believe this new bishop will add to this chorus beautifully. Dallas is a city of remarkable men and women, remarkable leaders of faith. It's a city of civic and political leaders of good will and good argument. A city that doesn't hide its differences, it celebrates them as it struggles to live an ethics of dignity and fairness for all. It's a great city, great because of this diversity. It's a city we love. \nAnd this week Bishop Burns joins us; he steps upon the stage. And I believe he'll do well. He'll smile; he smiles a lot. And he's going to talk a lot about Jesus. He will both comfort and irritate you with the Gospel of his Lord. He's a Catholic and a bishop of the Church, so don't be shocked when he says Catholic things. But that's as it should be in this beautifully diverse city of Dallas. It's part of what makes us beautiful, believers or otherwise. \nJoshua J. Whitfield is pastoral administrator for St. Rita Catholic Community in Dallas and a frequent columnist for The Dallas Morning News.
