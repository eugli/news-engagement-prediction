Michael Greenberg \nDan Rather -- legendary journalist and anchor/host of The Big Interview on AXS TV -- will be joining Charlamagne to break down solutions for living in a President Trump world and how history compares to this current political climate (see them above preparing for the sit-down). The iconic newsman has been outspoken about these aforementioned topics on social media (if you aren't reading his frequent and poignant Facebook posts , you should), so the conversation is guaranteed to be enlightening and educational. And, because this is Uncommon Sense , Rather will also be speaking about some uncommon topics as well! \nDon't miss the premiere of Uncommon Sense Live with special guest Dan Rather tonight at 11:30/10:30c on MTV2.
