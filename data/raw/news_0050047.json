It includes a deferral that would push $5MM of his earnings to 2021. \n10:35am: Wieters will receive a $21MM guarantee, per   ( via Twitter ). He’ll earn $10MM in 2017 and have the choice whether to take $11MM or return to the open market for 2018. \n9:04am: The Nationals are nearing a deal with free-agent backstop Matt Wieters , according to Jon Heyman of Fan Rag ( via Twitter ). It would be a two-year contract that includes an opt-out, per Joel Sherman of the New York Post ( Twitter links ) and Heyman ( via Twitter ). \nWieters is the top remaining player on MLBTR’s pre-offseason top fifty list ; he checked in at 16th. If a deal is finalized, he’d presumably receive the bulk of the duties behind the dish. The switch-hitting receiver would join a mix that includes Derek Norris — acquired earlier in the offseason — along with holdovers Jose Lobaton and Pedro Severino . \nIt’s unclear exactly how things could play out for the Nats, but adding Wieters would hold out the promise of upgrading the catching situation while also opening some room for further transactions. Norris and Lobaton are both playing on non-guaranteed arbitration contracts, with the former set to earn $4.2MM in his second-to-last season of control and the latter entering his walk year with a $1.575MM salary. Either of those veterans could be moved; parting with Norris would free more salary, though he has a stronger track record than Lobaton and the latter’s   are less necessary with Wieters on hand. \n[RELATED: Updated Nationals Depth Chart ] \nThe Nats could also consider dealing the younger Severino to address its needs at the back of the bullpen, though it’s far from clear how long Wieters will remain in place and the organization still faces long-term questions at the position. That said, the Nationals do have several other possibilities in the pipeline, including 40-man members Spencer Kieboom and Raudy Read as well as two other top-thirty organizational prospects in Tres Barrera and Jakson Reetz . The White Sox are clearly willing to trade reliever David Robertson , of course, and could well be interested in a controllable backstop; per ESPN.com’s Jayson Stark, via Twitter , the Chicago organization has been waiting to see if the Nats would land Wieters to “rekindle” talks on Robertson. In addition to Severino, it’s also possible that the White Sox could have interest in Norris, though presumably they’d also be looking for young talent in such a scenario. \nESPN.com’s Jim Bowden tweeted earlier this morning that Wieters’s agent, Scott Boras, was “meeting with both GM’s and Owners” and making progress on a deal. The veteran agent has long had a strong connection with the Nats’ ownership and front office group, with the sides working out significant contracts over recent years for players including Max Scherzer , Stephen Strasburg , and Jayson Werth . Young stars Bryce Harper and Anthony Rendon are also repped by Boras, as are lefty Gio Gonzalez as well as recent signees Oliver Perez and Stephen Drew . \nSoon to turn 31, Wieters finally returned to regular duties last year with the Orioles after two consecutive injury-plagued seasons highlighted by Tommy John surgery. But after receiving and accepting a qualifying offer last winter, Wieters was allowed to hit the open market following a disappointing season. Over 464 plate appearances, he slashed just .243/.302/.409, though he did swat 17 home runs. Though he has posted stronger offensive campaigns in the past, the veteran owns a league-average lifetime batting mark and has never quite developed into the top-level performer he once promised to be. \nThere are also some questions on the defensive side of the spectrum. While Boras has sought to push back against Wieters’s poor ratings in the eyes of pitch-framing metrics, his explanation isn’t entirely compelling on its face. That said, Wieters was able to cut down 35% of the runners that tried to swipe bags against him last year, helping to ease concerns over his elbow. And Baseball Prospectus credited him as a strong pitch blocker ( subscription link ), as it has in years past. \nOf course, a fair bit of a catcher’s value lies in the nebulous world of handling a staff and calling pitches, and Wieters has drawn his share of praise in that department. (See, e.g., here .) He does face long-term questions with his sizable frame, though those risks are lessened on a short-term deal such as this. And whether he can return to being at least an average hitter remains to be seen. \nAll said, then, there’s some risk here, but also the promise of a steady veteran in a key position. None of the Nats’ in-house options, certainly, hold out quite as much hope. Norris has profiled alternatively as a quality hitter who isn’t polished behind the plate, and (more recently) as a power threat that can’t get on base but frames well. Lobaton, clearly, is best suited to reserve duties. And while Severino impressed in brief MLB action last year, and comes with a highly regarded defensive profile, he has yet to reach the .700 OPS barrier in a professional season. \nPhoto courtesy of USA Today Sports Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:23:53.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
