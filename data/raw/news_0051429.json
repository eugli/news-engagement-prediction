Wellmann's Brands – the company behind Japp's Since 1879, Myrtle's Punch House, Melt and Old Kentucky Bourbon Bar – is bringing its Bottle & Basket brand to the CAC. Wellmann's Brands is opening a cafe and bar in the ground floor of the Contemporary Arts… more Provided \"Molly (Wellmann) has always loved the Contemporary Arts Center and we've done so many events with them,\" Wellmann's Brands spokeswoman Lisa Colina told me. \"We've done member events and provided cocktails for their drink and draw event. The conversation started there.\" Bottle & Basket CAC will take over the cafe space on the ground floor of the facility. It will open at 8 a.m. Monday through Friday and 9 a.m. Saturday and Sunday for breakfast and will also serve lunch. The menu will look similar to that of Bottle & Basket in Over-the-Rhine , but it will be expanded with an emphasis on breakfast sandwiches, panini and salads. Across from the cafe, the company is opening a bar called M. Wellmann's on the Walnut Street side of the lobby. That space will open at 4 p.m., when Bottle & Basket will switch over to a dinner menu similar to what it does at Myrtle's with charcuterie, small plates and shareable items. M. Wellmann's will serve a menu of signature craft cocktails as well as punches, wine and craft beer. “The renovation of our Kaplan Hall lobby and the inclusion of a café has been incredibly successful for us and created the artful, social space we desired to offer to our guests,” CAC director Raphaela Platow said in a news release. “We are thrilled to announce as our new partner Wellmann’s Brands with their expertise in food and cocktails.” Bottle & Basket and M. Wellmann's will open in phases this spring. The closing time for each area has not yet been set. The cafe space is currently run by Collective Espresso, whose lease expires on March 3. Brownfield covers retail and restaurants, technology, manufacturing and courts.
