It's harder to believe I've been a Patriot for 17 years! What happens on that field with my teammates, in front of our family and fans, is almost impossible to describe. It's mythical for me, and yet it's real. And it's why I'll never stop as long as I'm able.\" More from FoxSports ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:08:34.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
