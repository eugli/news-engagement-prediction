Marvel's Agents of SHIELD introduced the concept of Inhumans to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in Season 2. SEE ALSO: Marvel 'Inhumans' series coming to TV and Imax, but the movie is still off \n“Iwan’s ability to be charming, roguish, and still completely unexpectedly dangerous were all the different sides we needed to bring the character to life. We’re thrilled to have him on board,” said Jeph Loeb, Head of Marvel Television and Executive Producer on the series. \n“Maximus is a complex character,\" added executive producer and showrunner Scott Buck. \"Likable, charming, tragic and villainous all in the same moment, and I’m very excited to have someone of Iwan’s considerable talent.” \nThe series is the third Marvel TV series to air on ABC, following the ongoing Agents of SHIELD and the cancelled Agent Carter. Inhumans is co-produced by Marvel Television and ABC Studios. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:42:53.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
