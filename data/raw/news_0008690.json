Article continues below \nIndeed, United came dangerously close to losing the match. \nLazar Markovic, the on-loan Liverpool winger, could have stolen the points for the Tigers at the death but hit the inside of David de Gea’s near post instead of the back of the net. Article continues below Mata could - and should - have won it for United \nThe best chance of the game, however, fell to Mata in the second half. \nThe ball landed kindly at the Spanish midfielder's feet at the back post but his shot was somehow kept out by Jakupovic. Zlatan was critical of Mata after the match \nAfter the match, Ibrahimovic was in no mood to pay tribute to the Tigers’ goalkeeper and instead criticised Mata for failing to convert his gilt-edged opportunity. \n“I did not see any chances where it was difficult for the goalkeeper,” the Swedish striker told BBC Sport . “It was not a good save from Mata, it was a bad finish. Some saves he made for the cameras.” \nZlatan was also critical of his teammates in his interview with MUTV after the match - although on this occasion he didn’t single anyone out. \nWatch it here… Wasted opportunity for Mourinho's men \nUnited stay sixth in the Premier League table, 14 points behind leaders Chelsea and four behind fifth-placed Manchester City. \nAnything other than a top-four finish would be deemed a failure on Mourinho’s part - and so the Portuguese coach and his under-performing players have their work cut out to salvage something from their remaining 15 matches of the campaign. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
