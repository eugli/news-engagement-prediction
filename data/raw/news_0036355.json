The card features four ranked fighters, two former champions and a slew of up-and-coming talent that should surely put on a show for the Canadian crowd. \nLet’s take a closer look at how the hard-hitting matchups on the main card might play out. Zuffa   Srdjan Stevanovic/Zuffa LLC Derrick Lewis vs. Travis Browne \nNeither Derrick Lewis nor Travis Browne were very impressive the last time they entered the Octagon. However, the difference is Lewis was able to overcome his sluggishness and secure his fifth straight win while Browne dropped his fourth in six fights. \nLewis may have the momentum headed into this bout but he’ll be facing his toughest challenge yet in Browne. Browne’s aforementioned losses have come against former champions but before that he’d won six of seven, displaying elite striking that many thought would propel him into title contention. \nIf “Hapa” can return to form, I expect his boxing prowess to give him an advantage in this bout over Lewis. “The Black Beast” on the other hand has shown he has the ability to end a fight with just one punch, as he’s been to the judges just once in 10 UFC fights. \nI think Browne’s volume over five rounds will be too much for the Texas native. \nPrediction: Travis Browne by decision Getty Images Alex Trautwig Johny Hendricks vs. Hector Lombard \nFormer welterweights Johny Hendricks and Hector Lombard clash in the co-main event Sunday with the hopes of getting their middleweight careers on track. \nHendricks and Lombard are both exceptional grapplers with ridiculous power in their left hand. They combine to average over six takedowns per fight but considering their strong abilities on the ground and to defend takedowns, this fight could be fought largely on the feet. \nIn the standup game, they both land at the same rate and almost the exactly same volume, which should make for a fairly competitive bout … at least for the first five minutes. \nUntil Lombard shows a much-improved gas tank, I have little faith in him against a guy like Hendricks over three rounds. \nPrediction: Johny Hendricks by third-round TKO Zuffa   Donald Miralle/Zuffa LLC Sam Sicilia vs. Gavin Tucker \nCanadian UFC newcomer Gavin Tucker gets an established veteran in his UFC against featherweight Sam Sicilia. \nBoth these fighters have great power in their fist and know how to finish fights on the ground, but chances are this one will stay standing for however long it lasts. \nTucker has finished eight of his nine professional fights, although he hasn’t faced the competition Sicilia has during his 11-fight UFC career. \nPrediction: Sam Sicilia by decision Zuffa   Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC Elias Theodorou vs. Cezar Ferreira \nA spot in the middleweight top 15 could be up for grabs when Elias Theodorou faces Cezar Ferreira on Sunday. \nTheodorou fights at a blistering pace as he makes it one of his main goals to pressure his opponent from bell to bell. He lands 3.45 strikes per minute, nearly double that of his opponent, and absorbs less strikes per minute (1.9) than the average UFC fighter (2.5). \nFerreira lands a much lower volume than Theodorou but packs a bit more power and knows how to mix in takedowns to win rounds. \nFerreira might be the more talented fighter, here, but I think Theodorou’s pace and grinding style helps him walk away with the win. \nPrediction: Elias Theodorou by decision Zuffa   Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC Sara McMann vs. Gina Mazany \nGina Mazany took an extensive break after losing to Julianna Pena to gain entrance to the “Ultimate Fighter” house back in 2013. But she returned to the sport in 2016, upon which she earned a first-round TKO and stamped her ticket back to the UFC. \nShe’ll face a tough challenge in former Olympian Sara McMann, who has won back-to-back fights and is coming off a “Performance of the Night” bonus earning win against Alexis Davis. \nMazany might be talented, but she’ll likely struggle against a former title challenger in just her second fight in two years. This should, however, allow “Danger” to gauge where she is among the UFC women’s bantamweight top 15. \nPrediction: Sara McMann by third-round submission Zuffa   Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC Paul Felder vs. Alessandro Ricci \nPaul Felder looks to build on a strong 2016 with a win over well-rounded Canadian Alessandro Ricci. \nRicci is a solid fighter but may be outmatched by Felder in this one, at least on paper. But we all know fights happen in the Octagon, not on paper. \nOdds are, Ricci plans to keep this fight standing, which should work in Felder’s favor. The fighter out of Philly is the more active and fierce striker and given his track record, should have no problem earning a win on Sunday. \nPrediction: Paul Felder by second-round TKO Zuffa   Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:42:10.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
