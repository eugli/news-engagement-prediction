John Lynch (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:49 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:49 a.m. ET \nIn today's NFL, pretty much nothing is a surprise by the time an official announcement comes. Someone from within an organization leaks the information to Adam Schefter or Ian Rapoport before it happens, and then we wait for it to become officially official. \nBut when the 49ers hired John Lynch as their GM, it was a total surprise — because he wasn't even rumored as a candidate. His decision seemed to come out of nowhere, and it turns out, that was the plan all along. \nMORE: John Lynch details how he became 49ers GM \n“I made a big deal that this stayed quiet,” Lynch said Wednesday on KNBR radio in San Francisco. “First of all, you know what I was doing? Part of the rumors are things fly out of that building. So I wanted to see could I trust this building, you know? And so that was part of my thinking.” \nLynch noted the organization had a reputation for leaking information, so he tested the franchise to keep this a secret until it was time to announce. It's pretty safe to say San Francisco passed with flying colors.
