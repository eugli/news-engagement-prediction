TNN | Feb 23, 2017, 10.22 AM IST Leader of Opposition Rameshwar Dudi and PCC president Sachin Pilot during a meeting with Congress MLA in the city on Wednesday. JODHPUR: Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president Sachin Pilot on Wednesday attributed the relief to the farmers by the BJP government to the consistent pressure built by the Congress in favour of farmers. He said that the movement of the Congress turned out to be successful and the government backed off on the decision to increase power tariff for farmers. He was talking to media on Wednesday here after meeting with the party leaders and workers. He had landed in Jodhpur on Tuesday night. Pilot claimed that the Congress was going to form the next government in the state and that too with an unprecedented majority by surpassing the mandate, the people of the state had given to the BJP in the last election. \"Congress was going to form the next government in the state in next election as the BJP has miserably failed to rise to the expectations of the people with respect to the historic mandate it received,\" said Pilot. He further said that the BJP is going to present its fourth budget very soon but before this, the government should at least present before the people of the state, the achievements and budgetary works done in the last three years. \"Leave the work in entire state, Jodhpur being the second largest and important city of the state, which has been victim of constant neglect of the state government,\" he said adding that announcements were one thing and an easy task whereas realization of those announcements on ground was entirely different thing. Instead of reaching out to the people and talking about development, the government was engaged in politics of vendetta and pressure by targeting the Congress leaders and veiling the misdeeds of its own workers. Even the leaders and MLAs of the BJP itself have been expressing their displeasure with the way, the government has been functioning and have openly been admitting that they are finding it difficult to face the people.
