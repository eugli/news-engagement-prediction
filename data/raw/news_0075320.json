The #Panthers signed DE Mario Addison to a 3-year deal worth $22.5M, source said. At 29 years old, he had 9.5 sacks in 2016. \n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) February 26, 2017 \nAddison had a breakout year in 2016, setting career highs in sacks (9.5) and tackles (27) in 14 games. He has been one of the Panthers’ most consistent pass rushers, totaling a team-high 22 sacks the past three seasons. \n“Mario has shown he is one of the best emerging pass rushers in the league and he deserves this contract,” general manager Dave Gettleman said, via the team’s website . “He consistently affects the quarterback, and we envision an increased role for him in our defense.” \nAddison, who went undrafted out of Troy in 2011, bounced around his first two seasons in the NFL, playing for four teams during that span. But he has seemed to find a home with the Panthers, who took a major step back in 2016 after their run to the Super Bowl.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:26:33.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
