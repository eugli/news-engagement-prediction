Article continues below Story of fan who missed out on €34,200 thanks to Leroy Sane has brilliant ending \nBoth Foxes defenders were desperately signalling to Ranieri in search of reassurances about what they were being asked to do, and were condemned to a 3-0 defeat. \nAnd the issues between manager and players did not ease up following their convincing defeat to the league leaders, with regular line-up changes and alterations to the post-match menu angering the club's players. \nLeicester have won just one of their last 10 Premier League matches, which includes recent defeats away to Burnley and relegation-threatened Swansea City. \nHowever, one incident following the Foxes' 3-0 defeat at Manchester United was the final straw for one Leicester star who declared his frustration in front of the rest of the squad. Leicester star vents frustrations \nPer the Mirror , the unnamed Leicester player said: “That's it, we don't know what we are doing, we are ****ed.” \nBut despite their struggles in the league, Jamie Vardy's goal away to Sevilla stands the Foxes in a good position to seal their progression to the quarter-finals of the Champions League. \nOwner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, though, has vowed to put their Premier League future ahead of their ventures in Europe. \n“We are now faced with a fight to reach that objective and feel a change is necessary to maximise the opportunity presented by the final 13 games,” Srivaddhanaprabha said. Wage cut looming over players \nLeicester's players face seeing their huge wages slashed if they drop into the Championship, and it will be up to the likes of Vardy and Riyad Mahrez - who helped inspire the club to glory last campaign - who will have to desperately improve their form if they are to avoid such a disaster. \nVardy has netted just seven times this season, compared the goals he scored for Leicester last campaign, while Mahrez has also been a shadow of his former self. \nThe Foxes could be in the relegation zone by the time they play Liverpool on Monday night, with the club currently one point above 18th-placed Hull. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
