Now, one of those glorious machines has arrived in the States.\nThe Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Las Vegas now boasts the first public Champagne vending machine in the U.S. Located in the hotel's \"Sky Bar\" on the 23rd floor, it not only sells mini bottles of Mo√´t & Chandon, but also tiny flutes, so you can sip in style.\n But don't start saving up quarters just yet.\nAccording to Travel + Leisure , guests must purchase a $20 coin from the front desk in order to use the machine and provide an ID proving they are of legal drinking age.\nAfter the details are all sorted out, simply drop the coin into the machine and voil√†! It's time for a toast.\nWish they had these mini Mo√´t bottles at the mall!! #molasvegas #vendingmachine #onlyinvegas #moetchandon #moetros√© #mo√´t #champagne #cheers #mandarinorientallasvegas\nA post shared by Moto Moto Travel (@motomototravel) on Feb 2, 2017 at 6:12pm PST\nIf you lose me in Vegas, this is where you can find me üòÖüçæü•Ç. #Champagneallday #countingdownthedays #champagne #poppinbottles #yyc #ilovevegas. #Repost @mo_lasvegas with @repostapp „Éª„Éª„Éª Now voting in the #ChampagneCampaign! üçæ What will it be, Imperial Brut or Ros√©?
