The gang could be under a different guise and is going by the names “Tiny Devils” and “SPS-13” in Adelaide.\nIt is understood they’ve been targeting Australia to tap into the booming (and lucrative) drug market here.\nMS-13 gang members languish in 'gang cages’ in El Salvador. Picture: Giles Clarke/Getty Images Source: Getty Images \nTHEY’LL CUT OFF YOUR HANDS \nBorn on the rough streets of Los Angeles in 1980s by refugees from El Salvador, the deadly gang have since spread to Mexico, Canada and other parts of the US.\nOften terrifying to look at, gang members sometimes cover their entire faces in tattoos.\nThey are known to be particularly deadly, and use violence against people who disrespect them.\nMore than 100,000 members across the globe have joined the group. Some of them have been convicted of rape or murder, motivated by revenge.\nSome members are as young as eight and any new member has to suffer through an initiation of being brutally kicked and punched.\nThe gang above all values loyalty and if any gang member proves to be disloyal, they will be punished and either murdered or have their hands cut off.\nThere are many members who now live in El Salvador, and they’re so vicious, a separate prison has been set up just for them.\nThose in lock up thrust their hands through metal prison bars and shape them like devils horns and even some prison guards are too scared to go to the cells.\nEl Salvador is one of the most violent countries in the world, according to United Nations, which said it had a 2012 murder rate of 41.2 homicides per 100,000 people, and a projected murder rate of 91 per 100,000 by 2015.\nMembers of the MS-13 gang are transported in a van after being arrested for a crime.

We are concerned that (if) they partner with criminal groups like outlaw motorcycle gangs, it will make them more devastating,” he said.\nThe gang mainly focuses on extortion and drug distribution and Mr Selby said members “are brutally violent”.\nThe Herald Sun reports the gang could be storming Western Australia, NSW and Victoria as well as South Australia.\nFrighteningly, MS-13 wants to be the gang that has the highest number of killings across the world and the gang may have been infiltrating Australia secretly and slowly for some time.\nThere have been reports the inked up members are looking for clean skins to join their group so they can commit crimes inconspicuously.\nThey first made their presence in Australia known when they tagged a garage door in Bondi with their gang name in 2015.\nLetterboxes and walls in the suburb were also sprayed with bright blue graffiti and residents became fearful.\nAustralian Criminal Intelligence chief executive Chris Dawson told the Daily Mail Mexican cartel activity had started to emerge in Australia around 2014, which could be a sign the gang is establishing itself in Australia.\n“In July (2014) the Australian Crime Commission was involved in the arrest of two men allegedly linked to the drug cartel,” he said.\nMr Selby believes Australian authorities will be able to handle the gang because of their experience with the outlaw bikie gangs.\n“I’ve no doubt the authorities will be able to deal with it,” he said.\nMS13 gang members, who use the death’s head hand signal, are housed separately to their rival Barrio 18 members in El Salvadorean prisons.
