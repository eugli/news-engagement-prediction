Landing on a taxiway is a violation of FAA rules. \nThe plane Ford flew over was an American Airlines flight bound for Dallas with 110 passengers and six crew on board. \nFord is a flying enthusiast and a very experienced pilot, but has survived more than one close call over the past two decades. \nHe crash-landed a helicopter in Ventura County, California in 1999 during a training flight with an instructor.

He and his passenger were not hurt. \nFinally, in 2015, he crash-landed on a California golf course after reporting severe engine failure on his vintage Ryan ST3KR aircraft. \nFord was seriously injured in the crash, breaking his arm and suffering memory loss. He was praised for avoiding densely populated areas nearby. \nThe actor has also flown successful search and rescue missions and been honoured by aviation groups. \nHe was flying alone in his single engine Husky during Monday's incident, according to NBC.
