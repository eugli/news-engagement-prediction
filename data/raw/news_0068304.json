I will obstruct, I will protest, and as you can probably already tell I will not hold any punches back if the people of Orange are getting a raw deal.” \nThe former frontline cop snatched the seat of Orange from the Nationals in a stunning by-election victory last year, fuelled by anger over the dishlicker ban and plans to merger Orange Council with Blayney and Cabonne. \nMr Donato lashed the state government’s dogs debacle and the council mergers, saying the policies “smacked of an inner city decision made by elitist, out-of-touch politicians at the expense of regional communities and jobs”. media_camera The Baird government’s amalgamation of councils was a topic firmly on Phil Donato’s agenda. Picture: Will Tuck (SOCC) \n“I am not so naive to not recognise that my election to this place was largely affected by two key policy decisions of this government — the greyhounds ban and forced council amalgamations,” Mr Donato said. \n“It is not just the decisions themselves that are significant. It is what they represented: an arrogant and out-of-touch government. \n“They were a reflection on poor government decision-making. \n“To think that the people of NSW would just roll over and cop something like that is as ignorant as it is dangerous.” \nThe Berejiklian government is expected to table legislation soon repealing the greyhound ban and implementing a series of new measures to reform the industry. \n“I, like the majority of you, had no vested interest in greyhound racing when the decision was announced to shut down the industry via Facebook by former Premier Baird,” Mr Donato continued. \n“I distinctly remember listening to the Big Sports Breakfast program early one morning when the ban was announced, and thinking, ‘why?’ Philip Donato thanks Orange voters 0:25 \nPhilip Donato thanks residents who have voted in the Orange By-Election.
