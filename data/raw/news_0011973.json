We will not let them continue to develop ballistic missiles, we will not let them continue to transfer weapons to Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.'”Netanyahu told the cabinet that he will talk to May about strengthening the two countries diplomatic, security, economic and technological ties, “including close cooperation in the field of cyber security.”Netanyahu will be in London for 24 hours, coming back to Israel on Monday evening.He did not mention in the brief opening statements to the cabinet either the controversial settlement regulation bill, that is expected to come for a vote Monday evening, or the White House statement on settlements issued on Friday.That statement said that the US “desire for peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians has remained unchanged for 50 years. While we don’t believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal. As the President has expressed many times, he hopes to achieve peace throughout the Middle East region.”The statement said that the Trump administration “has not taken an official position on settlement activity and looks forward to continuing discussions, including with Prime Minister Netanyahu when he visits with President Trump later this month.”Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with Trump on February 15.Steinitz, however, did relate to the White House statement, saying that it was “positive from Israel's perspective.”Steinitz said the statement was a “fresh, positive” change for Israel that “unequivocally states” that settlements are not an obstacle to peace, and that “building and construction inside the settlements is acceptable to the US.”He said he did not remember the last time there was such a “reasonable and logical” US statement about settlements.
