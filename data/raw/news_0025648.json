However, they have failed to cover in their past four games on home court, dropping their ATS record at TD Garden this season to 11-16, better than only the lowly Brooklyn Nets and Orlando Magic in the East. \nThe Celtics also have produced mixed results when pegged as big favorites, winning outright in 21 of their last 24 when favored by nine or more points, according to the OddsShark NBA Database , but failing to cover in nine of 10, including five straight on home hardwood. \nBoston has held the upper hand in recent dates with the 76ers, winning 10 straight SU, including a 110-106 victory over the Sixers as 11-point home chalk on Jan. 6. But the Celtics face a revitalized Philadelphia squad that is riding a three-game SU win streak after knocking off the Charlotte Hornets 105-99 on Monday as 7 1/2-point road underdogs. \nThe 76ers also have covered in their past three overall, and in eight of 13 when listed as heavy underdogs of nine or more points. But Philadelphia also has regained its scoring touch in recent clashes with the Celtics, averaging 105.7 points in its past three games against Boston after averaging just 90 points per game in its previous four. \nFollowing Wednesday’s outing, the Celtics will visit the Chicago Bulls on Thursday before enjoying a week-long rest over the NBA All-Star break. Boston picked up a 107-100 victory over the Bulls at TD Garden as three-point favorites on Nov. 2, but the Windy City has been unkind to the team in recent years. \nIt has been over seven years since the Celtics last visited the United Center as betting favorites, with the team going 2-11 SU and 3-10 ATS in 13 road dates and failing to crack 90 points in seven of those contests. \nThumbnail photo via Russ Isabella/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T15:40:58.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
