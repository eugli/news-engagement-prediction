He died of his injuries the next day. \nBefore he died, Ross told authorities that he approached the passenger side of the vehicle and knocked on its door. \n\"At that time, (the vehicle) pulled away abruptly, striking the man in the process,\" Highway Patrol Sgt. Jorge Brewer said. \nA neighbor found Ross lying in the unpaved driveway and called 911, authorities said. Ross told investigators that two people were inside the vehicle, which he said was white with the words \"The Perfect Store\" printed on the side. \nThe vehicle was last seen traveling south on Possum Track Road toward Six Forks Road, authorities said. \nBrewer said troopers spoke with neighbors and reviewed security camera video from a nearby store but came away with no leads. \n\"If there was a hidden agenda behind this, it's still under investigation,\" he said. \"Right now, we do have a crime, which is hit-and-run, and what aggravates this crime is the fact that Mr. Ross has passed away.\" \nAnyone who witnessed the hit-and-run or might have information that could help solve the case is asked to call the Highway Patrol's Wake County District Office at 919-733-4400 or contact NC Wanted at 1-866-439-2683.
