Ad Feedback \nTogether, it jars said finance committee chairwoman Tania Hennebryâ€‹. \n\"I think it's when you see it in front of you, it just got hold of me the same as you,\" Hennebry said in response to Vercoe. \nOnly $149,000 has been spent on informing the public of the process and costs - a figure Hennebry said was \"disappointing\". \nBut the cost of the project was expected, chief executive Vaughan Payne said. \nIn 2013, council and partnering river iwi chose to use a collaborative approach to develop the policy. A business case and projected budget was done from the outset. \n\"Compared to a traditional process, we've done things quite differently and it has cost more money,\" Payne said. \nA big chunk of the cost came between 2014 and 2016 with $8.8m spent collecting scientific data not already in council hands and spiked when the Collaborative Stakeholders Group (CSG) began meeting monthly and then fortnightly toward the end of 2016. \n\"Traditionally, we would have used our own staff, mostly, we would have used councillors to make decisions and gone out and consulted with the community.\" \nThe Healthy Rivers project is in the draft stage and open to submissions so expect the costs to rise. \nBut Payne said those costs should be kept in context - they are spending less than $3m per year on a catchment worth a billion dollars to the nation's economy. \nRepresentation on the CSG by industry groups, iwi, local government, NGOs and rural professionals was done under the assumption that conflict would be avoided if everyone was at the table and informed from the start. \nBut it hasn't worked out, Councillor Bob Simcock said. It's opened council to even more disharmony. \n\"I would suspect what we have learned is that because the whole thing is more transparent, because there is more information floating around out there that, actually, we increase the conflict,\" Simcock said. \nThe collaborative process should deliver a better product, he said, but it could take much longer to arrive at it. \n\"In the past, the community had no awareness there was a plan change or anything until we stuck it on the table and said what do you think? \n\"Now, they are aware of it for bloody years and getting worried day-by-day and I'm just not sure how to manage that and I think it may prove to be a very expensive process.\" \nFormer head of the Hamilton Citizens and Ratepayers Association Rod Bowman said ratepayers won't be impressed with costs so far. \n\"Costs of that magnitude are obese,\" Bowman said. \"They are way out of line.\" \nHe approves of collaboration - transparency is vital - but the costs could be the downfall. \n\"There has to be more transparency in local government and unfortunately, in the past there hasn't been. \n\"It may be a little bit late in terms of this project and the money that has been spent.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:12:30.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
