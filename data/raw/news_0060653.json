I recall landing on my neck and the back of my head as well Eren Hussein J udge Heather Baucher QC said Mrs Hussein was intoxicated, obese, wearing shoes with high platform heels, and not taking care by holding the bannister as she descended.\n\"In her inebriated, obese state on three-inch platforms, that would be an obvious, simple step for anyone presented with what they saw as a hazard,\" she said.\nDuring the trial, the company director, from Lower Clapton, said she had been at a birthday party with her pregnant daughter-in-law when the accident happened in March 2012.\nAfter missing a step outside an upstairs lounge, she fell, tumbling down one flight, round a corner and down another, she said.\n\"It was dark, it was dim and I didn't see my step as I was going down,\" she told the judge.\n\"I tumbled over and over and over and I injured myself very badly.
