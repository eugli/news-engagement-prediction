They've been spit on. They've been kicked, punched, and choked.\nThey've seen their classrooms swell, while the staff room suffers.\nTo speak out is to position yourself against the school board and government in a time of rampant budget cuts and constant reshaping of the Newfoundland and Labrador education system.\nAnd so most teachers stay silent.\nBut not these teachers.\nDuring CBC's Inside the Classroom series, 30 teachers, principals, and school counsellors from across the province aired their concerns about their experiences.\nHere is a portion of what they said, in their own words:\nAnother use for garbage bags Kevin Flynn, an instructional resource teacher, told a story of a teacher being spit on so frequently, they wore a garbage bag to class. (CBC)\nKevin Flynn, an instructional resource teacher (IRT), described a situation where a colleague had to wear a garbage bag in the classroom to deal with a student who was prone to spitting.\nUnder the province's inclusive education model, all students are placed in the same classroom — even those with demanding special needs and behavioural problems.\nTeachers like Flynn, who focus on students of various exceptionalities, are at a premium in the province.\nThe teachers said since there are not enough IRTs to assist a growing number of special needs students in the classroom, behavioural problems are spiralling out of control.\n#Defeated Angela Dawe said large class sizes make her job more difficult, and often leave her feeling dissatisfied with her career choice. (CBC)\nAngela Dawe coined the hashtag, #Defeated, to describe how she feels about her job.\nThe junior high music teacher ponders if she would become a teacher again if given the chance to go back in time. Despite having three university degrees related to her job, she says she cannot give the students what they need.\nDawe blames a lack of resources and large class sizes for not being able to form bonds with her students, which in turn makes it harder to teach them.\nProblems with the province Gabriel Ryan has grown fed up with decisions made by government and school boards that affect teachers' jobs. (CBC)\nGabriel Ryan did not pull punches when describing the worst part of his job.\nA teacher and a union representative, Ryan said he has become fed up with decisions made at the school board level, that have stripped resources away from his rural school, and caused class sizes to increase.\nIt's the political decisions, he said, based on four-year terms, that have made things more difficult for teachers to do their jobs.\nMath methods not adding up Sheldon Slaney is frustrated with the multitude of ways he has to teach math to fourth grade students. (CBC)\nSheldon Slaney has grown frustrated with teaching math to Grade 4 students using a variety of outside-the-box methods.\nWhere there used to be singular methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, there is now a multitude of ways.\nSlaney must teach them all, even though the majority of his class will never use the other methods.\n\"I have to try and show all these different strategies that are actually frustrating kids more than helping them,\" he said.\nThe next generation Donna Reddick said she has no regrets about becoming a teacher, but often feels discouraged and worries about the next generation. (CBC)\nWhen asked if she would still become a teacher, Donna Reddick did not hesitate to say 'yes.'\nNow 32 years into her career, Reddick has gone beyond the usual 30-year service of a teacher. Despite having no regrets about teaching, she often feels discouraged and she worries about the teachers of the future.\nShe loves watching her younger students come to new realizations — the moment you see a child understand something for the first time.\nInside the Classroom: Read more stories from our series Without proper resources in place, however, those moments are getting harder to find.\n\"When my students go home at the end of the day, I sit down and I have a big sigh,\" she said. \"I feel discouraged.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T05:15:31.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
