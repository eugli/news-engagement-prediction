( Shutterstock ) These are gloomy times for electric utilities. After more than a century of fairly steady and predictable growth, they have entered stagnant waters. Demand for electricity is sluggish. Distributed energy resources (solar panels, batteries, etc.) are chipping away at their market share. Climate activists are always yelling at them for burning so many fossil fuels. It’s no fun. Despite the industry’s much-hyped “death spiral” — in which customers abandon utilities for distributed energy, prices rise on remaining customers, more customers leave, etc. — these troubles are probably not fatal.Even under aggressive projections, most electricity will come from utility-scale power plants through the middle of the century. Utilities will still be needed. But they do seem to be heading inexorably toward a much-diminished role, with much-diminished profits. Still, buck up, utility execs, all is not lost! There is a possible future in which utilities become bigger and more important than ever. What’s more, it is a future in which they take the lead in decarbonizing the country. They could be heroes. That is the good news in a recent paper from research consultancy The Brattle Group. It outlines a scenario in which utilities thrive, greenhouse gas emissions decline, and everyone joins hands in song. The key to everything (coincidentally, my long-time obsession) is electrification. Utilities are headed for stagnation US utilities, as readers of my primer on utilities know, make money by spending money. Specifically, their profits come from return on capital investments made in new electricity infrastructure. (They don’t make money selling electricity itself; for that, they only recover costs.) If they’re not investing in new electricity infrastructure, they’re not earning returns, and they’re not happy. And it doesn’t look like much investment will be needed in coming years. It’s not just that distributed energy is chipping away at the need for those investments. It’s that demand for electricity is forecast to rise very slowly, if at all. The US Energy Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) for 2015 projects that between 2016 and 2040, US electricity demand will grow by an average annual rate of 0.6 percent — as compared with an average of 1.3 percent over the past 25 years. And that’s using some fairly pessimistic projections for the growth of solar rooftop power. According to the EIA, just 7 percent of total US capacity for rooftop solar power (as calculated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory) will be developed by 2050. The Brattle authors calculate the impact on electricity demand if 50 or 100 percent of that capacity were developed: ( Brattle ) As you can see, if rooftop solar really goes nuts, total US electricity demand could theoretically decline in coming decades. That would not be good for utility profits. But here’s the thing. Even if the US maxed out rooftop solar, it still wouldn’t get close to the long-term greenhouse gas targets it needs to hit to avoid dangerous climate change:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:23:31.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
