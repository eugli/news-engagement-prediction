Pin \nAt the Quartermaine estate, Hayden explains to Tracy and Michael that the family’s bid for the hospital wasn’t high enough. Ned says his wife is willing to buy up his half of L&B Records. He then announces he’s going to ask Olivia to marry him and he wants her mom’s engagement ring. Tracy refuses and says Liv is not daughter-in-law material. Ned won’t back down. His mother does. She’s just afraid of losing him but gives him her blessing. \nNelle is in the Metro Court, copying the audio file she has of Sonny admitting his guilt. She puts it in a package for Carly and then drops it in the mail cart. Meanwhile, Jason and Sonny are having breakfast when Carly buzzes around them and tells her husband she’s planned a surprise for him. Once she leaves, Sonny says they can’t heal until they have answers. When the mobster steps away, Carly returns and thanks Jason for looking out for her and keeping Sonny from killing Ava. Nelle interrupts. Carly takes her aside and asks her to spruce up the cabin she’s taking Sonny to. Back at the table, Sonny assures Jason he’s not going to do anything impulsive but worries about what Nelle is up to. He found her bra planted in his bed. Jason suggests he come clean. Around the corner, Michael runs into Olivia in the hall and tells her Ned is selling L&B. Moments later, he bumps into Nelle and asks her to brunch. She must go to the cabin. He offers her a ride. She smirks and looks at the package she put in the mail cart. \nNew: General Hospital alum Ricky Martin (Miguel) on Harry Connick Jr. \nSam shows up on her mom’s doorstep and breaks the news that Ava’s been arrested. She doesn’t think she did it. Sam notices the flowers Julian sent and gets wrought up. Alexis explains that he knows that they have no future. He seemed to bid her goodbye last night. Sam would like to take the safety deposit box key and look into it herself. Her mom won’t let her. \nJulian meets with Olivia in her secret room. He says GH will be hers within a day and whips out the champagne. When he pours it, he turns and drops poison into her glass. Before they can drink, she ‘accidentally’ knocks it out of his hands. She offers him hers. He won’t drink it. “You tried to poison me!” she accuses. Leveling her gun at him, she gets him to empty his pockets. He challenges her to kill him. She won’t do that until the deal for GH is done. Once he leaves, she decides to give him a ‘reprimand’. Pretending to be Dr. Lee’s secretary, she calls Sam for an appointment. \nMore: Deconstructing GH: The nurses' strike, hospital woes, aren't exciting drama \nMichael and Nelle arrive at the cabin. It’s a blizzard outside. She tells him how much his friendship means to her. It feels like she’s about to skip town. The caretaker comes in to say the roads have been closed. \nFinn is at the hospital. Griffin pops up to discuss Anna. When Finn escapes, he calls Sonny to ask for an urgent meeting. Corinthos can’t help at the moment. When the doctor gets off the line, Hayden pops up and asks him about selling the patent. He apologizes for being curt to her yesterday. Meanwhile, Griffin gets Anna’s biopsy results and gasps. He runs over to Finn. Down the hall, Anna asks someone to get her a doctor. Robin appears. Griffin called her. Anna assumes something must be seriously wrong. Finn and Griffin enter. They announce she has PV, a rare blood cancer. Although they can treat her, there is no cure. Mother and daughter are left alone. Anna sobs. Robin offers to be strong for both of them. Anna insists she’ll be alright but her daughter says her place is with her. They hug. Down the hall, Finn meets Tracy and Hayden. Tracy offers him the jet so he can go to Manhattan and meet with the drug company. \nOlivia bursts into the Quartermaine estate. She finds Ned looking at the ring. He was going to wait, but drops on one knee to pop the question. “I can’t,” she says. That confuses him. She runs away. \nNed has something he needs to ask Dante. \nNelle and Michael deal with a storm. \nJulian confronts Jason.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:40:28.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
