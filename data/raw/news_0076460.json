You can work to improve your players.\n“But the results...the results in football are very important. We all know this and it can happen that one season you win the title and the next you can be going on your way.”\nChelsea saw off Swansea at the Bridge ( Getty )\n\nThe results are certainly going in Conte’s favour at this moment in time. The Italian watched his side overcome a stubborn Swansea side on Saturday, with second-half goals from Pedro and Diego Costa restoring Chelsea’s lead after Fernando Llorente’s header had earlier cancelled out Cesc Fabregas’ opener.\nThe 3-1 success equalled a club record of 12 consecutive home wins: a record not lost on Conte.\n“For sure it is a great achievement for the team, the players, also for me,” he commented.\n“This is my first season and to equal this record is fantastic for me, for the players. It is important for us to continue this way.\n“When you equal this record it means that you are doing well and that probably you stay on top of the table when we have this type of result. Now it’s important to continue to try to improve this situation, it’s very good.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:37:33.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
