Read More Son of Frank Sidebottom creator Chris Sievey has died following crash in Withington \nProf Trenchard became embroiled in scandal at Derbyshire after HR director Mrs Marks accused the then-chair of the trust, Alan Baines, of sexual harassment. \nIt was later ruled that Mr Baines had indeed sexually harassed her – before branding her a ‘whore’ when she spurned his advances. \nBut instead of taking action, Prof Trenchard colluded with him to push Mrs Marks out by accusing her of bullying, before having her escorted from the building. \nMrs Marks instructed solicitors and successfully sued for wrongful dismissal. \nThe tribunal ruled in April 2015: “We are satisfied that Professor Trenchard and Mr Baines colluded in an attempt to dismiss the claimant or alternatively obtaining her resignation.” \nDespite the trust suggesting Mrs Marks had ‘led’ Mr Baines on, it also concluded: “There was not a shred of evidence to suggest that at any stage she had indicated that she would be willing to enter into a sexual relationship with him.” Helen Marks \nMrs Marks was awarded £800,000 in damages and received an apology from the trust. \nProf Trenchard was then suspended for seven months, earning £90,000 while not at work. \nLast February he resigned with a £75,000 pay-off. \nWe can now reveal that just five months after quitting Derbyshire, Prof Trenchard was hired by Pennine Care – which provides mental health services to a million patients across Oldham , Bury, Rochdale, Tameside, Glossop, Stockport and Trafford – as an external consultant. \nThe trust, whose chief executive Michael McCourt also sits on the board of mental health body Positive Practice with Prof Trenchard, confirmed he had been hired on a two-day-a-week contract last July but refused to disclose his salary.

Barbara Keeley said she was ‘appalled’ by the appointment (Photo: Jen Urwin) \n“Do they really want someone working there who has such a stain on his character?” she said. \n“It’s worrying that the health service seems to look after their own – and not care about the people they damage en route. This is supposed to be a caring organisation that is dealing with very vulnerable people and they should have people of the highest calibre.” \nShadow health minister Barbara Keeley said she was ‘appalled’ by the appointment, adding: “I have raised in the past this unacceptable ‘revolving door’ culture in the NHS where staff move on to be paid in new NHS posts after findings against them result in resignations and pay-offs. \n“I will be raising this issue with health secretary Jeremy Hunt and asking him to look at this as a matter of urgency.” \nAfter the tribunal ruling in 2015 health regulator Monitor – which has since been renamed NHS Improvement – opened an investigation into ‘governance concerns’ at Derbyshire, which subsequently issued a series of criticisms over its leadership and HR processes. \nPennine Care refused to say who provided references for Prof Trenchard but said he was hired thanks to his ‘wealth of knowledge and experience of leading front-line mental health services’.

Therefore, Prof Trenchard was selected based on his wealth of knowledge and experience of frontline mental health services. \n“The trust was made aware of the tribunal details and the reasons for leaving his previous role. \n“The matter was openly discussed with Prof Trenchard prior to his appointment. \n“Directors concluded it was a separate matter that did not relate to the work he was expected to carry out on the trust’s behalf. \n“Prof Trenchard reports progress directly to an executive director. His work to date has been very well-received and has helped the trust make positive progress with its strategy. \n“Prof Trenchard is a champion for service users and carers and he has brought a helpful focus to our planning.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:08:06.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
