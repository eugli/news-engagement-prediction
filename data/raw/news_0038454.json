Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe Europa League tie between Manchester United and Saint-Etienne is all about Pogba v Pogba. With Paul playing against Florentin, there has been plenty of focus on the two Pogba brothers. \nBut did you know there is a a THIRD Pogba brother who plays professional football? \nBecause while all of the focus, fame and attention can fall on certain members of the family, it is easy to forget that there are other siblings plugging away in the lower reaches of the game - often ignored and just referred to as \"so and so's brother.\" \nBut who are some of these men? And where do they play? Not all pairs of brothers can be as famous as these two (Photo: Ley Charlie/Daily Mirror) \nWe've tracked down seven of them. Mathias Pogba, brother of Paul \"Nice dabbing, Paul\" (Photo: Paul Thomas) \nWhile twin brother Florentin and little bro Paul battle it out in the Europa League, Mathias will be putting his feet up in Rotterdam. \nBorn in Guinea, the 26-year-old forward had spells in Britain with Wrexham, Crewe, Crawley and Partick Thistle before going Dutch last year. \nNot exactly dabbing with Stormzy, is it? Paolo Suarez, brother of Luis OK, you've got us - we can't find a pic of Paolo (Photo: Getty Images) \nLittle Luis Suarez would have grown up idolising his big brother Paolo, who is six years his senior and was good enough to play for Uruguay's under-20s in his youth. \nAlso a frequent goalscorer, that was about as good as it got for the now 36-year-old, though, as he bounced around leagues across South America and can currently be found in El Salvador. Giliano Wijnaldum, brother of Georginio He might not be as famous as Gini, but at least It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia \nYou've seen his big brother Georginio in the Liverpool midfield this season, and Giliano Wijnaldum is also the half-brother of the Huddersfield winger Rajiv van La Parra. \nAs for the man himself, well after a decent career in his native Netherlands and some youth international caps, he moved to the MLS with Philadelphia Union this year. Felix Kroos, brother of Toni Do not adjust your sets, this is Felix not Toni (Photo: Martin Stoever) \nReal Madrid's Toni Kroos is a World Cup winner and one of the best midfielders in the game today, while little brother Felix captains Union Berlin in the German second division. \nThere was a time when he was a little higher up the ladder, and playing for Werder Bremen in the Champions League, but the 25-year-old hasn't really kicked on after being capped at six different international youth levels. Rodney Sneijder, brother of Wesley The only Sneijder who has ever been to Dundee (Photo: Getty Images) \nThe Sneijder parents clearly enjoyed old school English names, with Wesley's other brother Jeffrey playing for Ajax's youth sides and little brother Rodney doing the same. \nHe went on to feature in the Dutch top-flight and even popped up at Dundee United in 2015, only to swiftly leave and head back to Holland following health issues. Tobias Schweinsteiger, brother of Bastian What's that floating away? Is it Bastian's career? (Photo: A. Beier) \nFor much of this season it seemed as though big brother Tobias had more chance of playing for Manchester United little brother Bastian. \nTwo years the World Cup winner's senior, forward Tobias had a career bouncing around the lower leagues in Germany before retiring in 2015 to become the assistant boss of Bayern Munich's under-17 side. Jonas Hummels, brother of Mats Looks like him doesn't he? (Photo: Bongarts/Getty Images) \nBoth Hummels brothers left Bayern Munich at an early age, but it is only Mats who finds himself back there now. \nYounger brother Jonas played for lower league club Unterhaching up until last year, but injuries have now forced him into semi-professional football.
