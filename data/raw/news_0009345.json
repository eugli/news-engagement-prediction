I saw it in 3D and it was amazing. I cant even begin to say how great this movie is. Bolt is so adorable and every character did such an outstanding performance and i loved it to no end. Excellent job to every cast member and again I loved this movie so much that I could watch it a million times and not get tired of watching it. Abosutley amazing and I cant wait to get it on DVD when it comes out !!! FANTASTIC JOB TO EVERYONE ON THE SET !!!! Surprising Good by brian577 The ads for this movie had me peg it as a simple animated comedy, but it was much more than that. With an impressive mixture of humor, action and the kind of heart you'd think you'd only see in a Pixar movie, the movie satisfies on all levels. All in all an excellent film, easily comparable to anything Pixar has done. Oh and for people who might be turned off by Miley Cyrus's presense don't let it bother you, you can hardly tell it's her and if you don't like her and Travolta's song during the credits (I do despite not being a fan of her) you can always skip them. Hate Miley,,,but still loved Bolt by musicluvr33452 Bolt is the best disney movie in years. It was cute, entertaining, and funny. I loved everything about Bolt! It was agreat use of my money. And I totally prefer it over the worst movie in history (aka Twilight). it may be animated, but it's a great movie.
