Disability Minister Penny Mordaunt said it was vital to tighten the law to ‘make sure we are giving support to those who need it most’. But Labour is threatening to haul ministers to the Commons on Monday to defend the move. And the government could now face a showdown over the issue with its own MPs, who have repeatedly defeated efforts to curb disability payments. The row centres on the eligibility rules surrounding the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) benefit. The Department for Work and Pensions lost separate court cases last year brought by a diabetic and an agoraphobic who claimed they had been wrongly denied the payments. An assessment of the ruling suggested it would open up the payments to people suffering a wide range of conditions which had previously been excluded. Sources said the new law would ‘clarify’ the rules. It will affect the eligibility of about 160,000 people suffering conditions including dementia, autism and anxiety.
