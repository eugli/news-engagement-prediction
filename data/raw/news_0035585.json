Photo by Chris Lee,   \nJUPITER, Fla. • Not long after Alex Reyes learned that he needed Tommy John surgery, Cardinals ace Carlos Martinez saw the dejected rookie struggling to cope with the devastating news. \nMartinez then walked to Reyes’ locker stall from across the Cardinals’ clubhouse at Roger Dean Stadium. \n“Lift your head up,” Martinez told Reyes in Spanish. “Hold your head up high. You’ll see how things will work out fine. Just keep focused on your recovery. Life delivers some tough blows at times, but you just have to absorb them and be strong.” \nFortunately for Reyes, strength and work ethic have never been a problem for him. The son of Dominican Republic immigrants learned the importance of perseverance and hard work growing up in Elizabeth, N.J., where his father, Tomas, supported the family by working double shifts as a security guard at the Elizabeth Board of Education. \nTomas and Dignora Reyes always let Alex and his two older brothers know that they would put in the work necessary so the boys could chase their dreams. \nSo it was no surprise Wednesday when Reyes, 22, rushed to call the two people who had nurtured his big league dreams since he first declared them during a grammar school writing exercise. \nThere’s no greater love than a parent’s. \nWhen your child is hurting, you’re hurting. When they succeed, you celebrate for them. \nReyes was hurting Wednesday, and his parents were hurting, too. \nReyes’ father “was very sad because you know this was going to be a big year for me,” Reyes said. “He just told me that these are difficult moments and you have to march forward.” \nThere are many long hours of rehab ahead. You can bet your Cardinals’ season tickets that Reyes has the work ethic necessary to overcome this injury. \nThis is merely one unexpected obstacle, a detour, not a stop sign. \nThis was supposed to be a big year for Reyes. Baseball America recently rated him as baseball’s No. 1 pitching prospect. He was among the early favorites for the National League Rookie of the Year Award. \nAlthough Reyes has thrown only 46 major league innings, he had already shown enough brilliance to earn a spot on the Dominican Republic’s World Baseball Classic team. \nThe WBC will have to wait. The Cardinals must wait as well, until at least the 2018 season. \nReyes, who routinely hit 101 mph on the radar gun last year, knew something was terribly wrong Friday when a sharp pain shot through his right elbow after he threw an otherwise innocent offspeed pitch. \nHe informed the Cardinals immediately and then held out hope. By the time he was sent for an MRI of his elbow Tuesday, the threat of Tommy John surgery sent a cloud of dread throughout the organization. \nThe worst fears were confirmed Wednesday morning, delivering a debilitating blow to Reyes, his family and the Cardinals. \nIf you want reason for optimism, though, it’s important to realize that most pitchers return after undergoing ulnar collateral reconstruction surgery. \n“The way (Tommy John) surgery is now ... they just do such a great job with the recovery and the training stuff,” said veteran righthander Adam Wainwright, who went through the same procedure in 2011 and returned to lead the staff. “They know the recovery so well. \n“It seems like it’s getting better and better. I didn’t know if that was possible, but it is. The odds of him coming back very, very strong are great.” \nFortunately for Reyes, he realizes he is not alone. \nHe has a strong family to lean on, whether by blood in New Jersey or through Cardinal red in St. Louis. \nMartinez made that clear Wednesday morning when he rushed over to give his young teammate some crucial words of encouragement. \n“Carlos just talked to me and told me to remain strong and keep my head up,” Reyes said. “He told me things like this happen. He told me that God willing if I take the right steps I’ll return to the level where I was. \n“He’s always made me feel like a friend before a teammate. He’s always been a good friend. The whole St. Louis organization has focused on that since the minors to try to make the clubhouse more like family than friends or work colleagues.” \nThere is no denying that there’s a long rehab ahead. The threat of setbacks is real. \nSome days will be excruciating. He should take comfort knowing that he was already one of those rare top prospects who lived up to the hype after he made his debut last Aug. 9. \nHe was 4-1 with a 1.57 ERA and one save in 46 innings over 12 games after he was called up from Class AAA Memphis. He overpowered hitters with an electric fastball and a wicked curveball. \nHis march to prominence has been stalled for now. Fortunately for him, his parents set a perfect example to follow. \n“It (stinks) just to go through this and miss an entire season,” he said. “But if those are the things that have to happen to get back on the field at 100 percent, then that’s what I have to do.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:33:51.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
