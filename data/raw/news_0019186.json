Credit Tony Luong for The New York Times It is only three or four years since Igor Levit came to widespread attention, but such is the intelligence and maturity of his pianism that it feels like he’s been around forever. With a series of outstanding recordings , political statements and provocative performances — including a staging by Marina Abramovic of Bach’s “Goldberg” Variations at the Park Avenue Armory — he has become an essential artist. On Friday, he makes his Carnegie Hall debut , playing Shostakovich, Frederic Rzewski and Beethoven’s “Diabelli” Variations, which he recorded in 2015. Asked to pick a favorite page from the program, he went for the Beethoven, choosing the transition from the penultimate variation, a blistering fugue, to the concluding minuet. A moment of only six bars or so, but six bars of consequence. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Photo Six bars from the “Diabelli” Variations. You’ve chosen a transition in a work that’s full of transitions. You take this journey over an hour, and you realize that the waltz is transformed into a minuet. But this transformation is incredible. You don’t know where you are, you don’t know where you are going. It might break down, who knows? You’re still in E flat major. Although the whole piece was in C major, C minor, C major, C minor, this one fugue in E flat is enough to make you forget that. It’s an anxious moment. And within the space of one bar, it turns us back into C major. This is just insanely beautiful. What happens between the last chord of the fugue and the first chord of the minuet, I can’t say is a holy moment, because I don’t think it’s a holy piece in any way, but it’s a gentle, warm, humane moment. You realize here that, “Wow, I’ve been wandering around for an hour, but here I am.” There’s this T. S. Eliot poem. He says, “We shall not cease from exploration/And the end of all our exploring/Will be to arrive where we started/And know the place for the first time.” That, for me is the essence of so much. It’s like we’re in Beethoven’s home. It’s of course far away from the waltz, but I have this feeling that I’m not in another place. You kind of realize that it’s over. You know that this is the last variation. You just know it. You know this is the last arrival. There’s nothing violent about it, and there’s lots of violence in this piece.

There’s lots of violence in Variation 28, it’s just pure aggression. And this is an incredibly violent moment, this arrival. But within six bars, the sun comes out again. There’s this silence before the minuet begins. How hard is it for you to judge that? Honestly, sometimes I just want to press a stop button, and say, “O.K., let’s just enjoy that.” It’s hard to decide when to go on. Sometimes I go on very quickly, and sometimes I don’t.
