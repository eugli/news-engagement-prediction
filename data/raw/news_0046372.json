PHOTO | COURTESY By DAVID KWALIMWA \nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp last week vetoed the possibility of Arnold Origi facing his cousin Divork Origi in a friendly match. \nAccording to the Liverpool Echo, the Harambee Stars keeper’s Norwegian club Lillestrom had requested for a friendly game against Liverpool in La Manga Spain last Saturday. \nBoth clubs have set up a mid-season camp at the Spanish base. \nKlopp however turned down the request, and with that went the chance of a potential “Origi derby” \nDivork explained: “Arnold sent me a text last week saying ‘we might be playing against you in La Manga’.” \n‘SCORE PAST HIM’ \n“At that time, I wasn’t sure if we would be going away. When it was confirmed we were coming to La Manga I was already thinking about the scenario of trying to score past him!” \n“It would have been the Origi derby but unfortunately it didn’t happen. Maybe it will in the future.” \nDivork’s dad Mike, who earned 120 caps for Kenya, moved from his homeland to Belgium in 1992, when he signed for KV Oostende. Divork was born in Ostend three years later. \nArnold is the son of Austin Origi, Mike’s older brother, who was a defender for Kenyan club Gor Mahia and captained both the club and national team. \nTheir uncles Anthony and Gerald also played professionally in Kenya.
