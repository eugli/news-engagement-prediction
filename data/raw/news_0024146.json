He's a really impressive young man,\" Anderson told the BBC. \n\n\"Root gets into situations, one-on-ones, with people. He speaks a lot of sense when he does speak. \n\n\"He's the obvious candidate. The decision is a big one because he's our best player, so you obviously don't want that to be affected.\" \n\nRoot, who has scored 4,594 Test runs since making his debut in 2012, has often been Cook's go-to man during matches, according to Anderson. \n\n\"In the brief period Alastair Cook's been off the field -- for bathroom breaks -- Root's been in there making changes. He's been good,\" he said. \n\nEngland face a busy year with a home series against South Africa and West Indies followed by the Ashes at the end of 2017 in Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T13:54:08.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
