It's going to be an interesting day tomorrow. The wicket is not giving too much help for the spinners, we have to be very very patient in the morning session,\" Ashwin said.\n\"It was a delight to bowl in the second innings. I was a little rusty in the first innings, got into a better rhythm in the second innings straightaway, bowling with the new ball.\"\nHe is the sixth Indian bowler after current coach Anil Kumble (619), Kapil Dev (434), Harbhajan Singh (417), Zaheer Khan (311), Bishan Singh Bedi (266) to take 250 Test wickets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:07:16.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
