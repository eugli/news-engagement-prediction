Staff Photographer Texas Rangers pitcher Chi Chi Gonzalez pitches during a spring training game against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Surprise Stadium on Friday, March 4, 2016, in Surprise, Ariz. (Smiley N. Pool/The Dallas Morning News) By Evan Grant , Staff Writer Contact Evan Grant on Twitter: @Evan_P_Grant \nSURPRISE, Ariz. -- While the full spring training camp didn't start until Tuesday, pitcher Chi Chi Gonzalez got his time in Arizona off to a big start. He and girlfriend, Ali Bejarano-Alva, were engaged on Valentine's Day. \nGonzalez had planned to propose over a fondue dinner, but encountered some issues with making special arrangements with the restaurant. \n\"So, while she was getting ready, I pulled the ring out of my backpack and said, 'Do you want to wear this to dinner,'\" Gonzalez said. \"She said, 'What are you talking about?' Then she started crying. And she had to redo her makeup. I was going to do it at dinner, but I was so nervous, I couldn't wait. \n\"This is a great way to start the season,\" he said with a smile. \"She's been with me through the ups and downs the last couple of years. We are in this together, baseball and life.\" This Topic is Missing Your Voice.
