Cory Bernardi says his new party 'will give hope to those who despair' at politics Read more \nMany of the climate change talking points pushed individually and collectively by these political groups perfectly match the propagandised science pushed by conservative “free market” thinktanks in the US. \nLike Bernardi, the likes of One Nation and Family First have taken their cues and inspiration from that US network of ideological “thinktanks” that push climate science denial as if their lives, or their salaries, depended on it. \nLet me explain. \nBernardi has been much more than just an outspoken politician who thinks human-caused climate change is mostly a fraud and that carbon prices are just “a form of socialism”. \nBernardi has been a funder and an organiser of the opposition to action on climate change in Australia for years. \nWhen Bernardi launched his Conservative Leadership Foundation (CLF) in 2009, one of the first action items of the groups the CLF helped to establish was to go after policies that put a price on greenhouse gas emissions . \nBernardi’s inspiration for forming the CLF, at least in part, came from a reported trip to the Leadership Institute in the US a year or two earlier. \nThe Leadership Institute trains young people to be conservative activists and “freedom fighters” that will go out into the world to “defeat the radical left.” \nThe CLF helped to fund and establish a network of conservative websites, including stopgillardscarbontax.com , which had another US-based climatologist and global warming sceptic, the Cato Institute’s Patrick Michaels, as a science adviser. \nBernardi himself has spoken twice at climate conferences organised by the US climate science denial group the Heartland Institute – once in Chicago in May 2010 and then again in Sydney in October that same year. Each time, Heartland paid Bernardi’s expenses . \nIn October 2011, Bernardi told Fairfax that he had “no comment” on the Heartland Institute and said his appearance was “not an endorsement or a disendorsement of any other views”. \nBut in his speech to a Heartland Institute-organised conference in Sydney a year earlier, Bernardi offered the institute a glowing endorsement. Cory Bernardi speaks to a Heartland Institute conference in October 2010 about his hopes to convince people that human-caused climate change was not a problem \nHe told the audience: “I have had association with the Heartland Institute for a little over a year now and it’s great work they are doing.” \nAt the earlier Heartland Institute conference in Chicago, Bernardi said it was “inspiring” to see so many people “committed to common sense on climate change.” \nIn his speeches, Bernardi offered a rallying call to like-minded folks to take on the science of climate change and efforts to price greenhouse gas emissions, which he said were “a form of socialism.” \nAt the Sydney conference, Bernardi advised the audience that what was needed was to take the efforts of climate science deniers (not his description) and “package it up into political sound bites”. \n“We have to expose the flaws of the IPCC conclusions and methodology,” Bernardi said, adding that he needed to “draw on the work that’s done by the likes of Heartland.” \nBernardi said: “My role, and I hope you will share it, is to distill the essence of these arguments and put them into something that the Australian people can understand.” \nA couple of years after Bernardi’s courting of Heartland, the institute ran a billboard campaign comparing people who accepted the evidence of human-caused climate change to the values of terrorist Ted Kaczynski . \nThe Nationals MP George Christensen, who for now has ruled out joining Bernardi, has also spoken at a Heartland climate event . \nAustralia’s richest woman, the mining magnate Gina Rinehart, is also reportedly backing Bernardi and joined him in meetings in New York in late 2016 with key figures from the Donald Trump camp. \nRinehart has previously supported speaking tours by Lord Christopher Monckton , the British climate science denier once described as a “ vaudeville artist ” by a former version of Malcolm Turnbull (the one that claimed to care deeply about climate change). \nMonckton helped to launch minor party Rise Up Australia , fronted by young Earth creationist pastor Daniel Nalliah. \nMonckton is also the “chief policy adviser” to the Science and Public Policy Institute (not an actual institute) – another of those US-based “thinktanks” that push discredited climate science talking points. \nAs recently as December 2016, One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts was rubbing shoulders in Washington DC with a who’s who of climate science deniers from this web of groups. \nAfter quitting the coal industry, Roberts became a voluntary project manager for the Galileo Movement. \nBut a couple of years earlier, Roberts was in New York for the first of Heartland’s conferences for climate science deniers (also there was David Archibald, a current One Nation candidate in Western Australia who recently labeled single mothers as being too lazy to get partners ). Cory Bernardi's unchained melody carries a simple note of cynical opportunism | Katharine Murphy Read more \nOne Nation’s climate policy is a literal cut and paste of the Galileo Movement’s wish list on climate change policy. \nThe former Family First senator Steve Fielding is another to have returned from a Heartland Institute conference with dodgy talking points under his arm. Fielding is long gone, but Family First’s rejection of hard evidence on climate science remains.
