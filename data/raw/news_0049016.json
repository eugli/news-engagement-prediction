At the heart of the effort was Lammers, who blocked more Syracuse shots (seven) than any Orange opponent has all season. \nFive observations from the game: \nWhen the game was won \nTaking advantage of Syracuse’s impatience on offense, the Jackets took off on a 14-2 run midway through the second half that took the score from a 35-all tie to a 49-37 advantage for the Jackets. In the spurt: a layup by guard Josh Heath in transition, an and-one layup in transition from guard Tadric Jackson after a made basket by Syracuse, a dunk by Lammers off an inbounds, catching the Orange asleep, and a 3-pointer by Jackson. \nDuring the run, Syracuse misfired from across the floor, partly due to poor shooting and partly Tech’s defense. The margin, which ultimately expanded to 13 pionts, provided enough cushion for the Jackets to survive a last-minute rally that narrowed the margin to two points (67-65) with 56 seconds remaining. \nFirst-half troubles \nTech had a tough time early adjusting to Syracuse’s defensive quickness and length. The Jackets had three shots blocked in their first six possessions and lost the ball on a shot-clock violation. Tech had to work for open shots, often going deep in the shot clock to get a shot. Tech was at its best moving the ball quickly to find open shooters or to get the ball into Lammers in the post. Lammers finished the half with 10 points. \nThe Jackets nearly lost contact with Syracuse late in the half when back-to-back 3-pointers by Syracuse guard Andrew White and a basket by guard Frank Howard gave the Orange a 30-21 lead at the 2:00 mark. However, the Jackets answered with a lay-in by guard Josh Okogie (after collecting a deflected shot), a free throw from Okogie and a deep 3-pointer from Jackson at the buzzer closed the gap to 32-29. \nStarring role \nLammers played one of his finest games in a season littered with superb performances. Lammers’ line: 23 points, seven rebounds, seven blocks, three steals, two assists, one turnover, 40 minutes played. \nIt followed one of his weakest games of the season, when he scored 15 points but gathered a season-low three rebounds in 40 minutes of play in Tech’s 70-61 loss to Miami last Wednesday. Lammers played on a sprained ankle that kept him out of practice the two days leading up to the game and lacked his normal explosion. \nScoring on lay-ins set up by teammates, dunks and an assortment of jump shots, Lammers made 11 of 18 shots from the field. His seven blocks tied for second most in Tech history in an ACC game, and he did it against a team that is one of the toughest to block in Division I. \nIt was the third game this season, and second in a row, that Lammers played all 40 minutes, a highly unusual accomplishment for a player standing 6-foot-10. \nTough on defense \nTech played one of its best defensive games of the season, holding Syracuse to 35.7 percent shooting from the field, the Orange’s lowest rate of the ACC season. Syracuse came into the game shooting 46.4 percent from the field in ACC games. Tech played mostly out of a 2-3 zone that rotated crisply and rarely permitted open shots. \nSyracuse attempted just 12 free throws, well under its ACC per-game average of 19.3. Intererstingly, the Jackets went to the line just three times in their loss to Miami while the Hurricanes attempted 27, a fact that did not escape coach Josh Pastner. Tech went to the line 22 times. \nNCAA hopes \nTech held its position on the NCAA tournament bubble with the win. At 16-11 (the NCAA selection committee will not consider one of those wins, over Division II Tusculum), the Jackets picked up two spots in RPI, from 78 to 76, accoreding to warrennolan.com. It helps, too, that Syracuse is also a bubble team. \nIf Tech can somehow finish the regular season at 19-12, its chances to earn its first NCAA tournament berth since 2010 look pretty good. After Syracuse, Tech plays N.C. State at home Tuesday, then goes to No. 20 Notre Dame Sunday and then plays two games in the final week of the regular season against Pittsburgh and Syracuse again.
