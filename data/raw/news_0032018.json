(Reuters) \nChris Pratt finds strength in his favorite Bible verse.\nThe actor wrote on Instagram that his brother made him a hand-made gift with a verse from Philippians.\nThe verse reads, \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\"\nPratt had originally asked his brother Cully, who is an army veteran, to make him a wooden tray for his keys, wallet and pistol. He had requested the \"usual Chris:\" An \"American bald eagle smoking a cigar, holding a machine gun and an American flag whirling all bad ass in the wind maybe with some nunchucks or something.\"\n\"But then,\" Pratt wrote, \"I thought a lot about being homesick. I'd like having a touchstone that I could take with me as I travel on the road for work.\"\nThat's when he came up with the idea of a tray with Philippians 4:13. One day later, his brother gave him the gift which also has a picture of Jesus etched in it.\nA post shared by chris pratt (@prattprattpratt) on Feb 12, 2017 at 7:47pm PST \n\"It's my favorite thing I have,\" Pratt wrote adding his brother is a \"hero who loves to make something out of nothing with his bare hands.\"\nA post shared by Cully Pratt (@cullypratt) on Feb 13, 2017 at 4:32am PST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:58:49.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
