Refuting it requires similar clarity. by Stephen Miller at a meeting with Donald Trump in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on January 30, 2017. From Bloomberg/Getty Images. In the opinion section of last Wednesday’s New York Times , journalist Masha Gessen and retired tennis star Martina Navratilova wrote an article on their feelings about the recent immigration restrictions ordered by Donald Trump . “This anger and despair make both of us feel as if we are losing our home,” they wrote. Since both writers had themselves immigrated to the United States, “home,” rather than being a place of birth, was somewhere that gave them “a sense of safety, a sense of familiarity, a sense of inhabiting space with certainty, a sense, indeed, of the certainty of that space—the opposite feeling of having the rug pulled out from under your feet.” This was all understandable—and sad. At the same time, their sentiments opened an unlikely window on the thinking of Trump’s chief advisers. Trumpism—along with its leaders in the White House—is often rejected as a doctrine of simple racism or ethno-nationalism. But such pejoratives obscure that it’s a mostly coherent system of belief (in contrast to the thoughts of Trump himself), one that’s more vulnerable than most to hijacking by racial extremists (take a bow, Richard Spencer ), but still—for now, God help us—separate from them. A few years back, Stephen Miller , a White House senior policy adviser at whose feet much of the tumult resulting from Trump’s immigration order has been laid , made some brief remarks at a conservative gathering in Palm Beach. “One of the things that we’re missing from our political dialogue right now is the idea that the United States is a home,” said Miller, who was then a staffer for Jeff Sessions . “It is more than an accounting sheet. It is more than the sum of its G.D.P., its total tax collections, or its total outlays. America is a family.” What threatened the American family and home, said Miller, was a government that cared more about numbers pleasing to business interests than to the concerns of those whom it was supposed to represent. With its push for ever-lower barriers to migration or trade, he explained, Washington was abandoning the “real flesh-and-blood citizens who together create this body politic, this nation, this home, represented by that flag.” This has been a staple of the belief system among Trump’s senior staffers: America is a home, not an economy, and the economy must serve the home, not the other way around. What Miller left unsaid, but implied, was also the contrast between home and doctrine. For the past two decades, prevailing opinion has embraced the idea of the United States as an “experiment,” a “propositional nation” or “creedal nation,” as Irving Kristol described it in 1995. In contrast to older nations, America is bound together by people “dedicated to the proposition” of constitutional democracy as laid out by Lincoln. It’s an appealing idea for a great number of reasons. It helps bridge our ethnic divisions, and it gives newcomers a fast track to assimilation. That citizenship is an act of will, a buy-in rather than something more organic, helps remove nationhood from the realm of “blood and soil,” a conception of nationhood that predated the Nazis but won’t soon recover from their embrace. Still, while stressing the creedal nature of the United States is effective up to a point, it resonates more among intellectuals than among ordinary people. Ideas can help create a community, but they cannot alone sustain it. Ask most people why they join armies, and they’re likely to speak of home and country more than propositions. Similarly, while ideas can strengthen bonds in a family—shared Catholic faith, for instance—most families aren’t based on ideas. They’re formed instead by proximity, affection, habit, and, more often than not, blood ties. Adherents of Trumpism therefore see in creeds only a limited panacea for our societal rifts, and in high levels of migration or workplace turnover an increase in existing pressures. Americans have never achieved the social cohesion of, say, 1940s England, where an unconscious patriotism and a sense of family offered what George Orwell called a “substitute for a world-view.” But we know that the sense of community in the United States used to be stronger. Many Americans have felt a way of life slipping quickly away—the “rug pulled out from under your feet,” as Gessen and Navratilova put it—often at the hands of trade and immigration. And not all are conservatives. A few years back, liberal humorist Joel Stein wrote a funny but edgy article about seeing his hometown of Edison, New Jersey, transformed by Indian immigration and trying “to figure out why it bothered me so much.” All of us feel the influences of ancestry and sense of place. It’s therefore notable, but not coincidental, that many of Trump’s senior staffers have strong ties to California, ground zero of rapid transformation at the hands of commerce and migration. These include Stephen Bannon , who lived for years in Los Angeles; Stephen Miller, who grew up in Santa Monica; and national security official Michael Anton , who was recently revealed as the author of an influential pro-Trump essay in the Claremont Review of Books (“The Flight 93 Election”) published under the nom de plume Publius Decius Mus. As Jason Willick and James Hitchcock observed in a perceptive article for The American Interest , California was the primary incubator of Trumpism, in part because it “squeezed into 40 years a transformation that is expected to take at least a century for America as a whole.” The good life in California has in many places never been better, but many old-timers feel an acute sense of loss. In no place is social atomization more severe. Once again, in these fights over “home,” we arrive at a fundamental divide between globalism and nationalism, one that will probably define our politics going forward, no matter what happens to Trump. The nationalism here isn’t really the narrow sort characterized by blind chauvinism and partisanship, but, rather, one that heavily prioritizes local interests over global ones. The related moral questions are as vexing as they get, because they touch on the capacities of human nature. In theory, perhaps, we ought to have universal love. Aren’t we all God’s children? Aren’t borders rather arbitrary creations? Many faiths and churches answer with a resounding yes, and, in a sense, they’re right. For the rest of us, though, family cannot be infinite. Or, as Orwell said, “To an ordinary human being, love means nothing if it does not mean loving some people more than others.” The ideologues in the White House assume that Americans care—and should care—most about fellow Americans. They want people who are already here to have a stronger say in what goes on than those who aren’t yet here. And implicit in their beliefs—and here is where even many conservatives get off the bus—is that people who have the strongest ancestral ties to the United States have the greatest claim on what happens to it. It’s a mindset not unlike that of ancient Athens, which restricted full citizenship to the third generation. But, of course, this isn't Athens. Many will disagree with these values, but nothing about them is obviously inimical to the Bill of Rights. Where they get most dangerous, however, is in their potential, like most ideas, for misuse. You can sell them by stressing how they’ll ultimately bring Americans together, or you can sell them by stoking people’s basest fears. When Trump proposed a poisonous and cynical blanket ban on Muslim entry back in late 2015, his team revealed its willingness to engage in, or at least accept, the latter. It continues to be toward Muslim Americans that the Trump White House has shown itself to be most unsympathetic and hostile. Because Trumpism tends to have been formed in rebellion against the dominant mindset, it’s unusually thought out for a political ideology. That makes it, whether you like it or not, very clear. Those who wish to combat it can attempt to employ demonization—or, like the masked attackers in Berkeley last week, bicycle locks, fire, and rocks—but eventually they’ll have to summon up the clarity of their own to refute it. In Friday’s Times , David Brooks reiterated the doctrine of the United States as a “purpose-driven experiment” that would be “brother and sister to the whole human race,” but that idea might need updating, especially in a country increasingly skeptical of intervention abroad. Meanwhile, the most pressing question faced by Decius and others on the right has remained unchanged since the rise of Trump: Even if the existential threat to “home” posed by the Establishment is as severe as you feared, at what point do the actions taken by the leader you’ve chosen leave us without a home to defend?
