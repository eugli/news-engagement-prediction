IndiaToday.in | Written by Samrudhi Ghosh Saif Ali Khan \nThe suave and sexy Saif Ali Khan is any woman's dream. But the dream turned out to be a nightmare for a British woman who was duped by a married man on Tinder, who had used a picture of the actor as his profile photo. \nAccording to Daily Mail , a man who goes by the name of 'Antony Ray' on Tinder had been using the Rangoon actor's picture and luring women into relationships. He led teaching assistant Anna Rowe to believe that she was the love of his life and that their relationship would culminate in marriage. However, she became suspicious when he could meet her only sporadically and hired a private investigator, who revealed that he was a married man with kids. \nThe man, who had a separate phone and social media accounts for his illicit relationships, used the photo of Saif Ali Khan to avoid being caught by his family. Since he bears a resemblance to the actor, he managed to get away with it to his Tinder girlfriends. \nAfter Anna, another woman has also come forward about being misled by the same man. \nALSO WATCH: Saif-Kareena become proud parents to a baby boy, Taimur To get the latest entertainment news and gossip, follow us on Twitter @Showbiz_IT and Like us on facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
