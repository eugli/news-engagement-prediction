She returns to New York to reconnect with lost friends from an avant-garde theater troupe — portrayed by Cara Seymour and John Ortiz — in search of lost love. \nProducers are Scott Macaulay and Shrihari Sathe. Strand worked previously with Macaulay on “First Love, Last Rites,” directed by Jesse Peretz, which Macaulay produced with partner Robin O’Hara. \nSubrin is a visual artist and filmmaker who made experimental films such as “Shulie” and visual art installations like “Sweet Ruin” and “Lost Tribes.” \nSpeculative Pictures Production is the production company in association with Durga Entertainment and Infinitum Productions. Siff is an executive producer with Ahsan Zaman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T08:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:47:23.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
