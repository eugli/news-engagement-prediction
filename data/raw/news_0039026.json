On Wednesday, Mr. Trump accused the agencies of leaking information to undermine him. [...] \nReporters Shane Harris and Carol E. Lee say their unnamed sources told them that in some of these instances, the withheld information had to do with “sources and methods” used to gather information. This has happened sometimes with other presidents, too. However, in those previous instances, the current and former officials said, the withholding was not done because intelligence officers were motivated by mistrust in a president or fears about his lack of discretion as is the case with Trump: \nMr. Trump doesn’t immerse himself in intelligence information, and it isn’t clear that he has expressed a desire to know sources and methods. The intelligence agencies have been told to dramatically pare down the president’s daily intelligence briefing, both the number of topics and how much information is described under each topic, an official said. Compared with his immediate predecessors, Mr. Trump so far has chosen to rely less on the daily briefing than they did. \nThere are also concerns about the relationship between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the Journal ’s sources. But is it just speculative concerns, or do some of intelligence withholders have verified information about the parameters of that relationship which gives them serious reason to worry? \nOne former intelligence official who was named in the story, Mark Lowenthal, said: \n“It’s probably unprecedented to have this difficult a relationship between a president and the intelligence agencies,” Mr. Lowenthal said. “I can’t recall ever seeing this level of friction. And it’s just not good for the country.” \nJust as is the case on a whole range of matters with Trump sitting behind the big desk in the Oval Office. \nThere are all kinds of trust/mistrust intersections in this story. It’s The Wall Street Journal; it’s intelligence agencies, some of which have a decidedly dark history; and it’s former and current officials some of whom are sure to have a personal agenda. So do some reporters. Good reporters get as many sources as possible in the time frame allowed to corroborate the others. We don’t know (because they don’t tell us) howmany “current and former officials” they actually talked to. \nIt’s always wise to be skeptical when agents and ex-agents of the CIA or FBI or other intelligence agencies are talking—especially from behind a shield of anonymity. However, at least on the surface this story makes sense. It could fall apart. But just having the White House say this isn’t true is the least trustworthy claim.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T11:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:07:57.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
