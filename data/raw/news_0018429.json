The mega-selling pop singer has two other children, Lourdes and Rocco, from previous relationships. \nMadonna had denied reports that she wanted to adopt again after she visited Malawi last month , at the time saying her trip was for her charity work. \nMadonna established the non-profit Raising Malawi in 2006 to provide health and education programs, particularly for girls, in the southeast African country.
