He likes Spiderman. He’s very smart. His mum describes him as a ‘loving, caring boy’. \nBut Caleb’s autism makes everyday things a little more difficult. How Oxfam is using London Fashion Week to make the world a better place \n‘Things we take for granted every day are difficult for him,’ his mum, Emma, told metro.co.uk. \n‘Simple things like a change in routine, a new food, visiting a new place can all be difficult. \n‘He also has speech delay so it’s harder for him to communicate.’ \nOne thing that Caleb’s autism makes particularly difficult is joining his family for a weekly shop. The bright lights, loud noises, and busy environment can cause an overload, leaving Caleb stressed out and prone to having a meltdown. (Picture: Emma Louise Passmore) \n‘It’s horrible to see your child struggling and upset,’ Emma told us. ‘These things obviously make it difficult for us as parents because it then becomes stressful for us. \n‘You feel like you are being judged as a parent by everyone around you.’ \nFor Emma, it’s the little acts of kindness and understanding that make things easier. \nSo when Emma took Caleb shopping at Lee Mill Tesco one evening, she was incredibly touched by the actions of Carol, a worker on one of the tills. Picture: Emma Louise Passmore) \nWhen Caleb reached the checkout, the overload of the shopping experience was causing him to act up. \nThat’s when Carol stepped in to help, asking Caleb to come behind the till and help her with scanning the items. \n‘Usually he hates strangers but he took a real liking to her and got up with her and helped her scan all our £270 shop and loved every minute he didnt want to leave,’ said Emma. \n‘Carol’s actions meant the world to us. It meant someone who is a stranger was accepting of our child just the way he is. And nothing is more important to us than our children. \n‘They helped caleb because they gave him a positive experience of shopping, meaning the next time we go he may not be so worried and may actually learn to realise that it [isn’t] all that bad.’ \nEmma shared her experience on Tesco’s Facebook page, where it received hundreds of comments praising Carol’s actions. Picture: Emma Louise Passmore) \nEmma hopes that by sharing her story, she’ll encourage other people to be as understanding of children with autism’s struggles to do everyday tasks. \n‘I wish people knew that any child with additional needs is unique and special,’ said Emma. (Picture: Emma Louise Passmore) \n‘They may have things that they find difficult and they may not cope with certain situations well but they are so gifted in many other ways. \n‘They can be extremely intelligent and are an asset to anyone who knows them. Dont let a medical term define a person. They are all so much more than that.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T13:19:15.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
