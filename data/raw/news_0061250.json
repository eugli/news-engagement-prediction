For her, it means more than trophies won after titanic battles on court. \"You know in the last 13 years I have seen kids who try to pick up a tennis racquet because of me. And that to me is very important as far as legacy goes,\" the Indian doubles star told us at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships. \"I hope when I retire there is lot more than just one Indian woman playing on this WTA Tour and competing for titles like I have been doing for so many years now,\" said Sania whose book on her life - Ace against Odds - received widespread praise in India last year. Sania isn't merely competing for titles now. The Hyderabad-based player with that Grafesque forehand is seriously pushing herself for a place in the pantheon of doubles legends. A French Open win in women's doubles and a Wimbledon triumph in mixed doubles will earn her a rare career Grand Slam. But Sania says she has never chased such records. \"Obviously I want to try and win Slams and those are our goals as tennis players. But we want to win every tournament that we play. On the WTA tour, we play 25 weeks a year. And for us it's very important to focus on every tournament,\" she said. \"But at this point, this (the career slam) is something we can't really focus on. I mean if it does happen for me to win the Wimbledon and the French next will be great. I have been close before. \"But if it doesn't happen I won't kill myself. I mean I have had a very, very good career and I feel honoured to have been in the number one position in doubles for almost a year, you know, and having won that many Slams I just want to enjoy my tennis.\" The 30-year-old player then said questions aimed at retirement and family planning irritated her in recent years. \"People have been asking me when I will retire for the past five years because they thought I was going to get married and have kids. They probably feel that that should happen when you get married,\" she laughed. \"I do think about it (retirement) sometimes, but it's not because of starting a family right away but because of my body, and the high level of competition I have to face and the kind of travelling that I have to do. \"But I still feel I have a few more years left in me. I enjoy the game and I love competing.\" Sania says she does love to reflect on a 'very special year and a half' with the iconic Martina Hingis. She has won all three of her Grand Slam doubles titles - 2015 Wimbledon and US Open and the 2016 Australian Open - with the Swiss legend. \"We achieved some amazing things together and that's something that has never been achieved in a very long time. We enjoyed our time together,\" she said. \"When we split in the middle of the year, we had to come out and play each other in the first tournament in Cincinnati in the final. But with her it was amazing to win Wimbledon and then to win the US Open without losing a set. That was quite an incredible run we had. Yes for both of us it was a very special year and a half.\" Finally Sania smiled when we couldn't resist the temptation of drawing a parallel between her personality and that of a current cricket superstar. \"Who? Virat (Kohli)? I think I have been asked this question before and I am sure they have asked him too,\" she said. Both of them, after all, are not afraid of speaking their mind. \"Well, Virat is an incredible cricketer. The reason he is such a good leader because he is not afraid and he is out there to win. He has got a personality and he is not afraid to show it. \"I think that's incredible. I have met him a few times and he is such a normal guy when you go out and have dinner in a bunch of five people. \"But you see the most amazing part about champions when they step on the court. They want to win and they believe they are better than everybody else. That's how you become champions. \"So yeah I don't know about the similarity but he does say what he feels and that's really good and he has taken Indian cricket to a new level.\" Sania Mirza, obviously, has played her part as well by putting Indian women's tennis on the world map. rituraj@khaleejtimes.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:23:56.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
