Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. The author at a young age. Story highlights Eric Levenson is an associate writer for CNN This is his personal account of an event that happened in 1997 A series of bomb threats have rattled Jewish Community Centers (JCCs) across the country over the past few weeks, sparking evacuations, presidential denouncements , and what some have called \"telephone terrorism.\" In each case, JCC leaders have taken the bomb threat seriously and evacuated the building. That makes sense to me. When I was a little kid, I found a bomb at my synagogue. It was Feb. 22, 1997, and I was a precocious 5-year-old boy in Jacksonville, Florida. That Saturday, as was pretty typical, my family attended services at the Jacksonville Jewish Center, which doubled as my synagogue and Jewish day school. Antsy and bored, my older brother and I left the main service room to play hide-and-seek in the hallway with a couple of friends. Lining the wall of the hallway were about a dozen large memorial plaques. I hid in a small nook between two of them. Read More There, I found a small item -- a pipe with some tape wrapped around it. I gave up hide-and-seek and showed my brother and our friends. We started playing with the thing, tossing it around and unwrapping the tape. I remember one friend said it could be an atom bomb. We laughed. Then an adult came and took it away. That's my personal perspective. Here's another perspective, courtesy of The New York Times : A man had placed a bomb in my synagogue a week earlier, and I was the one who finally discovered it. \"The bomb was not found until nine days later, when children attending a luncheon after a bat mitzvah discovered it and began playing with it. When two adults wandered by, the children were trying to tear the tape off the bomb's casing. After one child remarked that he had found a watch inside, one of the adults rushed the bomb outside. The police arrived, evacuated 750 people and blew up the device.\" New York Times, Feb. 26, 1997 Yep, that's me, one of the children who found the bomb. I survived, of course, as did everyone involved. I remember later speaking to some large men in suits who interviewed me. And there was a sketch artist who turned my childish descriptions into a really accurate drawing of the bomb.
