Being close to everything we want to access. Making life more streamlined so we can spend more time on the things that matter.'\nAs a result of the move, he no longer needs a car and he has easy access to the city's amenities.\nHis three sons and two daughters, aged between five and ten, live with him two weeks on and two weeks off.\nInnovative: He customized furniture - such as triple bunk-beds and beds that turn into desks - to make best use of the space\nBeliefs: He said his living decisions are based on 'cultural or moral' principals\nCost-effective: But living in a smaller space has also saved him money\nWhen Adrian and his wife were still together the family lived in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, for three years before splitting up and relocating to Vancouver.\nIt took him 12 to 18 months to furnish the apartment 'from the ground up'. When he moved in he said he 'literally started without forks and knives'.\nCatering for five children has led to some innovative design creations - including a triple bunk bed for the three boys made by a carpenter friend of Adrian's.\nSome furniture has multiple uses - such as a lower bunk that doubles up as a table.\n'There's a lot of different uses for each room and that's what keeps people out of each other's hair,' he said.\nMoney saving: His energy bills come to $40 a month - a huge reduction on the hundreds he used to spend living in a house\nRoom for all: The boys sleep in one bedroom, the girls in the other and Adrian sleeps in the 'den'\nThe boys sleep in one bedroom, Adrian in the other and the girls sleep in the 'den'.\nWhen they are not with their father they live with their mother in a townhouse in the city's suburbs.\n'It's hard to say what they prefer...I think they genuinely like it [the apartment]. They take the bus to and from school on their own.\n'That level of freedom is something they appreciate. Living downtown they can walk to things that they can't walk to in the suburbs - the park, a coffee shop.'\nTwo homes: When they are not with their father the children live with their mother in a townhouse in the city's suburbs\nFriendly company: When the children are at their mother's, Adrian often invites people to stay because he said it can get lonely when they are away\nHe said he does not believe in the 'north American' expectation that a family should have a house and at least one car.\nWhen the children are at their mother's, Adrian often invites people to stay because he said it can get lonely when they are away. Recently he invited a friend to stay with and teach him Spanish.\nAlthough Adrian, who writes about his experiences on his website Five Kids One Condo said his living decisions are based on 'cultural or moral' principals, they have also saved him money.\nHis energy bills come to $40 a month - a huge reduction on the hundreds he used to spend living in a house.\nHe said: 'A lot of people think living further out is cheaper...but when you add what you spend on cars it's far more expensive.'", "external_links": ["http://vancitycondoguide.com/", "http://5kids1condo.com/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-22T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:11:00.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
