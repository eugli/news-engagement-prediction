But if a person encounters an aggressive coyote, they should follow these steps:\n• Do not try to touch it.\n• Back away while remaining calm.\n• Do not turn your back or try to run.\n• Make lots of noise — pop an umbrella, throw an object or shake keys — and wave your hands.\nIf the coyote poses an immediate threat or danger to public safety, call 911. If you have returned home, you can call LaSalle Police  at 519-969-5210 x 0 to report the incident. We assess all calls involving dangerous animals and work with the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR). If we determine there is a danger to the public, we can ask MNR to catch/trap and remove the dangerous animal from the area.\nYou can also contact MNR directly at 1-800-667-1940 or visit their website for further information.\nhttps://www.ontario.ca/page/preventing-and-managing-conflicts-coyotes-wolves-and-foxes", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:01:41.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
