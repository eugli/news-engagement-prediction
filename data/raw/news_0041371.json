And seeing as this was on top of the last increase it made it more of a priority. \n\"I've been a customer for around two or three years - so I thought, it's definitely worth a try!\". \nLike many Sky customers, Matt says he's never had an issue with the service - but this price hike was one too many. \nInstead of settling for it, he got on the phone to Sky and tried to haggle his way out of coughing up. \"Haggling works!\" Matt says it's always worth a try \n\"The customer service was really good. I got through to the department that discussed contracts - it wasn't directly the cancellations team. \n\"I originally asked if there was anything they could do to lower it, and mentioned that there were other companies that offered competitive rates. \n\"They offered a deal which matched the ones advertised online for 'new customers' and within 10 minutes I was all set up and ready to go. \n\"I'm very happy with my new deal. It's as good as anything online and it means I don't have to switch and get charged for a new router.\" Read More This is how to haggle - and win at it \nIf you've been hit by the hike, Matt says you shouldn't settle for it. \n\"I'd say always do some research and ask your current provider what they can do for you before moving. \n\"If they have good customer service and can give you a decent rate, there's no need to change provider.\" What the experts say You can play the big firms at their own game (Photo: Getty) \nTelecoms regulator Ofcom says that customers can exit their plan fee-free if their bills are ramped up without warning. \nBut, if you want to avoid the hassle of switching, you can play the big firms at their own game by haggling for a better deal. \nHannah Maundrell, editor in chief at Money.co.uk says: \" It pays to be brave as Sky is notoriously receptive to haggling especially if you threaten to leave. \n\"It’s really as simple as giving them a call and asking them how low they are willing to go to keep you as a customer.\" What if I can't get a better deal? \nIn line with Ofcom regulations, customers can exit their plan penalty-free if their provider hikes prices without notice. \nTo cancel, customers will have to contact the firm directly within 31 days of receiving confirmation of the price change - you won't be able to cancel without this. \nSky says these letters and emails are now being sent out to customers - and will arrive by 25 February 2017. You'll need your account number and billing information to hand to verify your account. \nAn Ofcom spokesman told Mirror Money: \"Ofcom’s rules clearly state that, should a provider introduce increases to the monthly subscription price beyond that agreed by the customer at point of sale, then they must allow that customer to exit their contract without penalty. \n\"As a result, customers would be free to take advantage of competition in the market and choose an alternative service that best meets their needs and budget, should they wish to.\" \nHannah Maundrell adds: \"Even if you’re tied into a tariff, the price hike gives you a get out of jail free card and you could leave penalty free as long as you give notice within 31 days of getting told about it.\" \nHow to contact Sky: \nCalls to Sky contact centres are inclusive for Sky Mobile and Sky Talk customers.

The changes take effect from 1 March 2017 (Photo: PA) \nSky phone, broadband and bundle TV customers are to see their bills rise on 1 March 2017. \nLine rental is to rise by an extra £19.08 a year, meaning instead of paying £17.40 a month, you'll pay £18.99. \nSome TV or Broadband customers, who are either on \"legacy products\", or who had previously been benefiting from a lower price, will also see their bills brought into line with current pricing.
