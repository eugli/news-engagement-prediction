Switching things up with some hot or unexpected moves gives you both those butterflies you felt way back in the day when you first got together. \nHere are a few sexy ways to surprise your partner and possibly reinvent your relationship without all the pressure of finding the perfect gift to buy. 1. Make out like you're 21 \nWhen's the last time that you cornered your partner in the laundry room and kissed him with your entire body? Once we're in a committed relationship, sometimes we forget how hard it used to be to keep our hands off one another. This Valentine's Day, remind him. Or if you're out driving, ask him to pull over. When he does, jump in his lap and take him right there on the side of I-69 or in a parking lot! \nMore: The One Trick to Feeling Closer and Avoiding Disappointment on Valentine's Day 2. Give him the remote \nRelinquish the remote to your, ahem, toys; for example the OhmiBod Club Vibe 2.Oh vibrating panties. It's a lacy black thong with a remote control that works up to 20 feet away. The vibrations can be keyed to music or your partner's voice. You could have a full-on orgasm eating tapas while your partner whispers sweet nothings. It has five vibration speeds and patterns and it's USB re-chargeable. Plus your partner will definitely be pleasantly surprised by the act of sexiness. 3. Initiate sex \nIn our house, even though I am always up for sexy time, I am terrible about initiating sex. It's not that I don't want to. I just have 101 other things to do. It's not fair. So, if you really want to surprise your guy this Valentine's day, just do it. Lean in; rub your hand up his thigh while you're sitting on the couch watching Seinfeld reruns. Or if you want to kick it up a notch higher in the surprise area, rouse him gently and affectionately from his slumber for a little middle-of-the-night sex. \nMore: Yes, Valentine's Day Is Commercialized â€” But It's Still Important 4. Begin the day with a blowjob \nIf there were one key to peace on earth, I am pretty sure that it is blowjobs for breakfast. If you really want to knock your partner's socks off first thing in the morning, greet him with a few gentle kisses down below and then go full-on- marathon fellatio. He won't know what hit him but he'll awake from his ecstasy-induced coma grateful and with a giant smile on his face. 5. Unexpected public sex \nIt's cliche but it really will put a little sexy shock and awe into your relationship. Surprise your partner at the office, wear a trench coat and your sexiest piece of lingerie or nothing at all, pull the blinds, lock the door (or not) and have sex right there on his desk, the floor, the conference room or in the supply closet. I wouldn't recommend this for people with cubicle mates. What's your sexiest way to surprise your partner? \nBefore you go, check out our slideshow below.
