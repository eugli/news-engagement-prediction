Home data packs for customers will apply even while they roam across India, Airtel said. (Image: Reuters) Bharti Airtel Ltd on Monday said that it has removed additional charges on voice, SMS and data usage on national roaming, ostensibly in an effort to retain users in the wake of the new entrant Reliance Jio’s free voice and data services.\n“Airtel customers roaming within India will enjoy free incoming calls/SMS and there will be no premium on outgoing calls allowing them to speak freely wherever they are within the country,” Bharti Airtel said in a statement. “Also, there will be no additional data charges on national roaming. Home data packs for customers will apply even while they roam across India,” the statement added.\nReliance Jio, which will start charging regular tariffs from April 1, too, does not levy any national roaming charges on use of its mobile services anywhere in the country outside the home circle.\n“This marks the death of national roaming and the whole country will now be like a local network for our customers, who will not have to think twice before making or receiving calls or using data while traveling outside their home base,” Gopal Vittal, MD & CEO (India & South Asia), Bharti Airtel, said in the statement.\nMeanwhile, for those customers travelling overseas, Airtel has introduced an automatic adjustment facility, which seeks to prevent the users from steep roaming charges on international networks. Under the facility, the user will be automatically moved to the respective country’s 1-day tariff plan upon hitting the price of one-day pack, Bharti Airtel said.\nYou may also like to watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:15:17.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
