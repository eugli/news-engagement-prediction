We’ve seen it before with people like Britney Spears or Lindsay Lohan. The same people who put him into a God-like place are the same yapping at his heels for a piece of flesh when something happens…The piece is intended to be as critical of us as consumers and the media as it is of Kanye himself.” A post shared by Plastic Jesus® – Official (@plasticjesus) on Feb 13, 2017 at 1:34pm PST \nHe later revealed that his message with the piece is to “By all means, treat and respect these people are artists, but don’t make them into gods — because we crucify our gods.” \nThe “False Idol” sculpture has been temporarily placed on the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and La Brea Avenue. Plastic Jesus will later move the piece to a space in the former Tower Records building for his “Anesthesia: The Art of Oblivion” art show. \n“False Idol” is one of several pieces Plastic Jesus has created surrounding Hollywood’s most coveted affair, the Oscars. A previous piece from the artist featured a life-size Oscar statue snorting cocaine while on all fours. \nWest has been the subject of other unsolicited art projects, including a mural in Sydney, Australia of the rapper kissing himself and a mural in Melbourne, Australia of a scene from his “Famous” video , where he made a tableau of himself, Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian, Ray J and more all without the consent of the other celebrities.
