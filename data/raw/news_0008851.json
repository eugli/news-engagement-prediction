The 30-year-old is recovered from a right Achilles tear that he suffered last March and is known for producing in clutch moments, despite his lowly career averages of 9.0 points and 3.8 assists. \nHinrich is well-versed when it comes to switching teams. Last year, he played for the Chicago Bulls and Atlanta Hawks. The 36-year-old holds career averages of 10.9 points and 4.8 assists per contest and is known for his three-point shooting accuracy (a career 38 percent shooter from deep). \nStephenson is the most versatile of the three and despite the fact that he's a wing player, he also has above-average facilitating abilities. As an elite perimeter defender, the 26-year-old is healthy after rehabbing from groin surgery in November. Earlier this season, he played six games with the Pelicans before the injury and averaged 9.7 points, 4.8 assists and 3.0 rebounds per contest in limited minutes. \nAt least one, if not two, of these players will likely be signed in the near future as Cleveland looks to halt the recent struggles and turn their 2017 performance around.
