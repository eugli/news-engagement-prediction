Cue lots of speculative guessing over the next few months! \nSpeaking to Metro.co.uk at a recent event, he shared: ‘Basically, everyone will be at it! There’s a love triangle that kicks off over the summer and it crash lands out of the blue. It’s two people that you wouldn’t have necessarily thought would embark on such a wild, crazy liaison. \n‘It’s sexy, destructive and also kind of funny – it’s a man and two women and the bloke haplessly gets stuck between two people that he can’t choose between which will be good fun.’ \nMoving on to talk about the other passionate affair on the horizon, Iain teased: ‘Chalk and cheese doesn’t even cover it! What’s more unpalatable than chalk? It’s like rocks and Philadelphia soft cheese – that’s how separate they are. If you thought about the most ying and yang characters in the village, it would be them. \n‘It’s unbelievably sexy and dangerous and insane – I love it. The early phases of that are just coming into the scripts now so I’m only really just dipping my toe into the water with that at the moment. When it was first suggested, it’s the sort of thing that you go: “Really!?” And then you kind of go: “Yeah, I’m weirdly turned on by that!” Hopefully you’ll all agree otherwise, I’ll look very silly. \n‘Honestly, pick the two characters who are least likely to end up in bed together – it’s a fun game to play at home! That kicks off around April time so it’s a little while off yet. But this spring and summer, there will be a lot of romance and love in Emmerdale…’ \n*Fans selves heavily* All the press event gossip! \nIn case you missed any, here are links to all of the articles from the Emmerdale press event. \nFirst details of Chas’ exit revealed ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:40:15.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
