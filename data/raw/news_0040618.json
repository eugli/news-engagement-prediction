Exposing The New York Times'\"alternative facts\" about Flynn, CNN's Jim Sciutto reports The FBI is not expected to pursue charges against Michael Flynn . \nEarlier today, media reports hit that FBI agents interviewed Michael Flynn when he was national security adviser in the first days of the Trump administration about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. \nWhile it is not clear what he said in his interview, the FBI now adds that investigators \"believed that Mr. Flynn was not entirely forthcoming, the officials said.\" That avenue raises the stakes of what so far has been a political scandal that cost Mr. Flynn his job, and which Sean Spicer explained today was merely a matter of Trump \"losing trust\" in his Security advisor, because if authorities conclude that Mr. Flynn knowingly lied to the F.B.I., \"it could expose him to a felony charge\", even though some have questioned how an illegally obtained transcript of his phone conversation could be admissable as evidence in a court of law. \nBut now, CNN's Jim Sciutto reports, Breaking: FBI NOT expected to pursue charges against #MichaelFlynn regarding phone calls w/Russian Ambassador, reports @evanperez \n— Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) February 15, 2017 \nAnd even more disappointingly for those calling for his head... More: FBI says Flynn was cooperative and provided truthful answers \n— Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) February 15, 2017 \nSeems fair, The FBI had no problem letting Hillary Clinton off the hook despite numerous attempts to hide the truth.. and from what it seems now, Flynn didn't even do that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:03:10.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
