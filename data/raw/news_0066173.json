After his city-specific proposal, “D-Insurance,” failed to gain enough support in Lansing, his new efforts will focus on statewide car insurance reform. \nBut much of his speech centered on blunting the criticism of some who say Detroit’s post-bankruptcy progress is happening mostly downtown and in Midtown, while the neighborhoods continue to struggle with blight and unemployment. \nRelated: Replay: Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan's State of the City \nA new jobs program, “Detroit at Work,” launches Wednesday. It aims to link residents with open jobs – in a variety of fields, from food service to asbestos removal – through training programs that have a direct pipeline to those available jobs. \n“If we’re going to fulfill a vision of building a Detroit that includes everybody, we’ve got to do a whole lot more,” Duggan said at the beginning of his hour-long speech at Focus: HOPE on the city’s near west side. “You can’t have a recovery that includes everyone if there aren’t jobs available for everyone willing to work.” \nDuggan said the city’s unemployment rate as of last month was 9.8% -- still the highest in the state, yet down from about 18% three years ago. \nIn addition to the Detroit at Work program, the city is partnering up with unions to get more Detroiters working on new construction projects. \nOn a given day at the Little Caesars Arena construction site, Duggan said, there are about 120 plumbers working. Yet there are only about 58 licensed plumbers in the city. \nCouncilwoman Janeé Ayers said after the speech that the jobs programs are a good start, but the city has a ways to go. \n“I definitely think we’re on the right track. Are we where we need to be? No, we’re not there yet,” Ayers said. “How do we prepare people from the beginning and how do we switch the narrative of just go to college. That’s not for everybody.” \nFor all Detroiters, Duggan said he is committed to providing affordable housing. He shared a story about seniors who got kicked out of their housing and were at risk of being forced out of their second home before his administration stabilized their situation. \n“We’ll do everything within our legal power to keep you in housing affordable and keep anyone from moving you out,” Duggan said. “We are going to have a city where anybody can live everywhere.” \nSeven new affordable housing developments have been built in the last three years, he said, and eight more are under construction. \nDuggan said he fully supports a new ordinance Councilwoman Mary Sheffield recently introduced to set aside up to 20% of the units as affordable housing in new residential developments that receive city assistance. \nAs it is now, Duggan's administration typically requires developments involving tax breaks to designate 20% of new units as affordable — meaning rent is set aside for residents who earn 80% of the city's average median income, which equates to about $38,000. \nSheffield’s ordinance could require the following set-asides: 10% of units for those earning 80% of average median income; 5% for those earning 60% of the average median income; and another 5% for people earning 50% of the average median income. \nSheffield said she and Duggan’s administration still have to discuss certain aspects of the ordinance, but, given the mayor’s support tonight, she is hopeful. \n“Hopefully we can come to an agreement about how the actual ordinance looks,” she said. “It’s just about making sure all Detroiters have access to new residential units that we’re seeing in the city of Detroit.” \nDuggan said he expects new residential projects in the city as part of a neighborhood reinvestment program with $30 million lined up through Invest Detroit, a community development financial institution. \nThe program, which he called the strategic neighborhood fund, will begin in three neighborhoods: Livernois-McNichols, Southwest Detroit near Clark Park, and West Village. Duggan said he expects more money in the future to expand the program in other neighborhoods. \nElsewhere, the city will continue its aggressive blight demolition program, which is under an ongoing federal investigation. \nDuggan predicted the city will tear down 10,000 vacant properties in the next two years, which isn’t far off the more than 10,800 demolished in the last three. \nDuggan conceded mistakes were made in the past – prices spiked not long after he overhauled the program in 2014 – but reassured the audience of about 500 that new protocols established with the state’s help have corrected past problems. \n“We’re going to do with all federal and state regulations,” Duggan said. “We’re going to run this program in a way that will make you proud that you supported us.” \nContact Joe Guillen: 313-222-6678, jguillen@freepress.com or on Twitter @joeguillen.
