We didn't want anything on the ground or on the beds or just taking up space,\" Ms Willett said. \n\"Building our own van enabled us to put in a four-bunk back bedroom for the kids, a dining booth and a full kitchen with an oven, a 180-litre fridge and a full-size double bed.\" Photo: All of the Willett children are home-schooled, meaning there was no getting out of schoolwork on the road. (Supplied: Tania Willett) Plenty of places to stop and stay forever \nThe family set off south from Bundaberg heading for Tasmania, although debate rages in the caravanning community as to which way to circle the continent — clockwise or anticlockwise? \n\"It depends what time of the year you leave and where you leave from,\" Ms Willett said. \n\"We left in June so we headed south in winter which didn't make sense to a lot of people. \n\"We travelled south first into Tassie, then we came back to the mainland, up through the centre and then west and anticlockwise around the WA coast. \n\"You also have to take into consideration headwinds, because travelling west across the Nullarbor during certain times of the year will double or triple your fuel consumption.\" Photo: The wide open road is a lure to many who have the travel bug. (Supplied: Tania Willett) \nMs Willett said along the way there were many places they could have stopped and stayed forever. \nThe family stopped in for eight weeks at Alice Springs, mostly due to meeting like-minded families travelling the same way. \n\"You can never anticipate what a place is going to be like. Some places you pull up and you think it's going to be great but you hop into bed and you leave the next day,\" she said. \n\"Then you get to places like Alice Springs and you meet some other people and you say 'Would you mind looking after our kids for a couple of hours?' and they're more than happy to do that. \n\"Then you return the favour. Out on the road we're all in the same boat.\" Photo: The children look on as Ms Willett investigates a friendly lizard.

It can be really scary but if you're not doing something scary then life is just boring, isn't it?\" she said. \nA big challenge for the Willett parents was finding time to be a couple. \n\"We would try and get a little break in the evenings. We'd say 'You guys can watch a movie' … we can just sit outside and be alone, have a drink, have a chat and plan the next leg of the trip,\" Ms Willett said. \nShe said she was surprised by how many other families were doing the same thing. \n\"We thought we were going to be the only ones out there. Surely nobody else is this crazy?\" she said. Photo: The family often hooked up with other like-minded families for fun and support. (Supplied: Tania Willett) \n\"Once you get out there, you realise there are so many other people on the road. \n\"We met a few families that we travelled on and off with for six months continuously, because our kids got on so well and we were going in the same direction. \n\"There are a few social media groups that are centralised around travelling families, so if you're interested just search one up, have a look and you'll see how many people are doing it — it's amazing.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:19:47.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
