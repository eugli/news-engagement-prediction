(Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe Washington Capitals may have created an arms race in the Eastern Conference on Monday night when they acquired defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk in a deal with the St. Louis Blues, according to several media reports. \nIt’s your move, Pittsburgh Penguins. \nThe Capitals already own the NHL’s best record, lead the league in goals-against average (2.10) and are tied for second in goals per game (3.31). Now they have given up a first-round pick in 2017, a conditional second in 2018 and prospect Zach Sanford (second-round 2013) to acquire the top rental property heading into Wednesday’s 3 p.m. ET NHL trade deadline, as first reported by ESPN's Pierre LeBrun and confirmed by Jeremy Rutherford of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . \nLast season, the Capitals, who have never won a Stanley Cup, finished first overall and then lost to the Stanley Cup champion Penguins in the second round. They clearly wanted to take a major step to prevent that from happening again this season. \nThe Blues retained some of Shattenkirk’s salary to help the Capitals fit him under their salary cap. \nShattenkirk is an offensive-minded defenseman, an elite puck mover and power play quarterback. The Capitals already owned the NHL’s fifth-best power play (21.8%). \nThis move trumps the Penguins’ most receipt acquisition of veteran defenseman Ron Hainsey from the Carolina Hurricanes. \nBoth of those moves would seem to put pressure on both the New York Rangers and Columbus Blue Jackets to answer with moves of their own. \nMORE NHL: Martin Hanzal trade shows Wild are thinking Stanley Cup \nThe Rangers have a need for an offensive defenseman. They might be interested in two-way defenseman Brendan Smith if the Detroit Red Wings don’t re-sign him. The Blue Jackets need to strengthen their depth. \nThe arms race is far from over. Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford has said he may not be done. They may upgrade their forward group, which leads the NHL in scoring. It’s not unthinkable that they could also add another defenseman. \nAlthough the Blues are still trying to make the playoffs, this move made sense because they felt like they needed to get a return on Shattenkirk, who was going to leave through free agency this summer. Last summer, the Blues lost David Backes and Troy Brouwer without getting a return. \nThe Blues undoubtedly believe their defense, still with Alex Pietrangelo, Jay Bouwmeester and Colton Parayko, is strong enough to overcome Shattenkirk’s loss.
