Then the own goal is the worst thing that can happen. \n\"If you have chances you have to take them. When you have a game won and you draw this way you have to be disappointed. \n\"You expect to win at home, but it's a long season and we have to carry on.\" \nBenitez also signalled his frustration at a failure to add to his squad during the January transfer window, indicating he was hoping to strengthen but wasn't given the backing by the club to do so. \n\"My decision was very clear, [but] it was not my decision,\" he said. \"I said what I wanted and needed, and what the team needed, and that was it.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:39:51.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
