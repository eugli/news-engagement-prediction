Ricketson said. \nGrinstead was 30 years old when she vanished on Oct. 22, 2005 from her home in the farm town of Ocilla. Her cellphone was found inside her home and her car was in the driveway, but her keys and purse were gone. \nGrinstead was reported missing two days later when she failed to show up for work at Irwin County High School, where she taught history. Investigators said Duke had attended the high school and graduated in 2002. \nGrinstead competed in several Miss Georgia pageants and was crowned Miss Tifton three times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:53:37.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
