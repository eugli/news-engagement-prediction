Trump dismissed legitimate questions about Russian influence over his now-former national security adviser as \"fake news;\" told reporters he disagrees with \"everyone in this country,\" all of whom apparently want him to torpedo a Russian spy ship sitting 30 miles off the Connecticut coast; deflected questions about his team's connections to Russia by attacking no-longer-rival Hillary Clinton; and most alarmingly, declared that he recently learned from a briefing that a \"nuclear holocaust would be like no other.\" \nSleep well tonight, everyone. \nBut for the average person — the casual Trump supporter, or maybe not even — the exhibition was a perfect example of what endears Trump to many Americans: he's real. Trump was relaxed, unrepentant and defiant in the face of reporters' questions. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) \nFor Washington reporters, a presidential press conference is supposed to follow a particular formula. The president arrives, usually late, and delivers a standard speech. He will take a few questions — \"Sorry, folks, this will have to be the last one; the president is needed in the cabinet room\" — expertly pivoting from whatever the specific query happened to be with a line from a carefully crafted script: \n\"You set a red line with Syria over chemical weapons, President Obama, and Bashar al-Assad crossed it. What are you going to do?\" \nObama: \"I didn't set a red line; the world set a red line. The world set a red line when governments representing 98 per cent of the world's population said the use of chemical weapons are abhorrent.\" \nReporters would then, in this bygone era of normalcy, spill out of the conference room and dutifully file stories about whether the president is walking back earlier statements. It's all very polite, very regimented, very predictable. Without precedent \nTrump blew that all up. Yes, he arrived late, but the rest of the parade was without precedent. He was relaxed, unrepentant and defiant. \n\"I inherited a mess,\" he declared, as if to inoculate himself from later criticism and questions. \nHe was unfazed by questions about disgraced national security adviser Mike Flynn, who reportedly talked about sanctions with Russia's ambassador while Obama was still in office. Trump said Flynn was \"just doing his job\" and adding, \"I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him because that's his job.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:45:46.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
