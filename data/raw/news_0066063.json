Murray, USA TODAY Sports) 6 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nEVANSTON, Ill. — For so long, all Chris Collins could do was sell himself — and his idea of what Northwestern basketball could be. \nA perennial NCAA tournament team, chasing the occasional Sweet 16. A program with top-of-the-line facilities that could win over local recruits normally headed out of state. A team that played like it expected to win games, instead of just clinging to hope. \nAt that point, nearly four years ago, Collins didn’t have much else to sell. He’d never been a head coach before, but his pedigree and experiences — his father, Doug Collins, an NBA mainstay, and his career both as a player and assistant coach for Mike Krzyzewski at Duke — lent some credibility to the new, young coach who was energized to build tradition at a place that never had it. \n“When you look at all the coaches that have eventually built top programs like a Coach (Tom) Izzo (at Michigan State), a Coach K — When they all started, there was a group of guys that believed in those guys before they were those guys,” Collins told USA TODAY Sports. “For Coach K, it was Johnny Dawkins and Tommy Amaker and Jay Bilas. For Coach Izzo, it was Mateen Cleaves and those guys from Flint. And then they make it big and then kids want to follow that. Pretty much every coach down the line has that beginning of those guys that believed in them before they were Hall of Fame coaches.” \nMORE NORTHWESTERN This could be the year Northwestern makes NCAA tourney \nCollins isn’t putting himself in that stratosphere just yet; but he’s trying explain the importance of his first recruiting class — and the linchpin of this year’s Northwestern team, which is 20-8 (9-6 Big Ten) and currently projected to earn a No. 9 seed in the NCAA tournament — that includes Bryant McIntosh, Vic Law, Scottie Lindsey and Gavin Skelly. \n“Those guys were following a vision, a pipe dream, and we didn't really have anything to show for it,” Collins said. “We had an older arena — there are no banners — not great facilities, no winning tradition. Basically, they just believed in what my dream was. To see those guys be at the forefront of building it, it's made it a lot easier now. \n“I tell recruits that all the time. I say, ‘I’ll always be indebted to those guys because it's easier for you to listen to me now because we're winning.’ ” \nNorthwestern guard Bryant McIntosh (30) celebrates with teammates after making a three-point basket against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights during the second half at Welsh-Ryan Arena. The Wildcats won 69-65. (Photo: David Banks, USA TODAY Sports) \nCollins was a better salesman than perhaps he even realized at the time. Or what he was selling was more appealing than he could have imagined. \n“I believed that I could be part of something really special, something that had never been done,” McIntosh said. “At a lot of schools, there’s not that opportunity. … There was no legacy here. There were no banners hanging, no jerseys hanging. The belief that you could leave your own legacy, you could be the first to ever do it — that was something really appealing.” \nAnd it’s closer than ever. \n*** \nNorthwestern has never made the NCAA tournament, which makes for one of those streaks that’s not really a streak because it doesn’t have a starting point. Its starting point is, well, never. This program is the only one in a power conference to have never made it to the big dance. \nCollins has never shied away from that fact, and that notoriety. \nMORE COLLEGE HOOPS NEWS Free of NCAA ban, SMU steps into national equation — in post-Larry Brown era \n“At the beginning of the year, you talk about your goals, and of course, we talked about being an NCAA tournament team being a big goal of ours this year and believing we can do it,” Collins said. “Then, we’ve been really good about, at least with the guys, not talking about the tournament because to me, I don't think it's relevant.” \nAnd when he has talked about the NCAA tournament — like he is now — he’s tried to bear the brunt of that responsibility. He doesn’t want his players to play tight or play stressed. “The moment we start doing that, it’s going to go south,” Collins said. \n“For me, I try to put as much of it on my plate as I can because my whole life has been about pressure. I chose to be in basketball‚ I had a father who was the No. 1 pick in the draft, NBA All-Star. So when I was a player, there was always pressure to live up to that. When I got into coaching, and then I choose to go to a place like Duke where every day is a pressure cooker, as is everything you do. For me, I'm not bothered by any of this because I feel my whole life I've had pressure on me. I don't want them to have to feel any pressure.” \nNorthwestern Wildcats center Dererk Pardon slams in an easy two. (Photo: David Banks, USA TODAY Sports) \nAnd, theoretically, they shouldn’t — despite knowing they are carrying the weight of a program and alumni base. Collins knows it’s a bit cliché to keep harping on his beloved Chicago Cubs, but he wants his players to play like the young stars of the Cubs did during their World Series run: Freely. \nWhich is easier said than done, as evidenced by a 2-4 record in the last six games, and the losses that have been marked by unusually poor three-point shooting. Three games remain on the regular-season schedule: A road trip Saturday to Indiana, then a pair of home games against Michigan and Purdue. \n“None of the young men that wear the uniform for us are responsible for the inefficiencies we've had in years past,” said Northwestern athletic director Jim Phillips, another Cubs diehard who likes the parallels he sees. “That's just the way it is. These guys haven't been a part of our program for 20 or 15 years. … With a new group, I don't think they necessarily carry that burden. Certainly they shouldn't carry that burden. \n“They know about the past. People remind them about the past all the time. … It’s really about: You can't live in the past. They've had nothing to do with the past.” \nNorthwestern Wildcats head coach Chris Collins talks with his team during a time-out against the Penn State Nittany Lions. (Photo: Rich Barnes, Rich Barnes-USA TODAY Sports) \nCollins has used little bits of history to motivate his players, but nothing all-consuming. The idea of winning in Columbus for the first time in 40 years; his players could focus on that for one game, for example — which worked. Northwestern beat Ohio State, 74-72 on Jan. 22. \n“That helps kind of take the focus away from the macro, like the NCAA tournament and all that excitement,” Collins said. “All these guys have been asked that question every day ever since they committed here. It’s like you can just avoid it. It's there.” \n*** \nIt’s strange to think that a loss is what convinced these Wildcats they had what it took to be a winning program. But that’s exactly what a Nov. 16 loss at Hinkle Fieldhouse did. \n“We lost at the buzzer, which was disappointing, but I was just watching us play and watching our poise and seeing us stay confident in that moment, in that environment,” Collins said. I remember coming out feeling really good about the team. … Everyone's been so invested in to trying to win and to try to become that team we all want to become.” \nThat feeling — that Northwestern was not just hoping to compete against a good team in a tough environment, but rather playing like it expected to win — has been part of the major cultural shift under Collins. \nNorthwestern Wildcats forward Vic Law signals three. (Photo: Caylor Arnold, USA TODAY Sports) \nAnd it’s been noticeable to anyone who has watched the team play in the past four seasons. The Wildcats had improved from 14 wins in Collins’s first season to 15, then 20 last year (though they still finished ninth in the 14-team league). But there’s a difference between that kind of slow, steady growth and the kind of leap a program needs to take to make the tournament. Collins noticed it first in offseason workouts. \n“Nobody was satisfied with what we had been,” said McIntosh, the junior. “It was time for us to change. It was time for us to be tough and be everything we had talked about.” \nNo more hoping and praying to be competitive. They knew they were skilled enough to beat any team on any court at any time. \nNBC Late Night host Seth Meyers noticed it in the locker room in Brooklyn, after he watched his Wildcats beat Texas at Barclays Center. Meyers went into the team’s locker room after the game to watch Collins give his postgame speech to his players. \n“It was just kind of fascinating to see,” Meyers said. “I’ve never been inside a locker room of a winning team — anytime in my youth or since — but you just realize, ‘Oh, these guys believe in him.’ Then, and over the course of this season, I got the sense that what I saw then was not a team that couldn’t believe they won that night against Texas. It had actually gone the way they thought it would, and that was kind of special to see.” \nTo Phillips, none of this is surprising. Not the culture change, the expectations of winning, the year-on-year growth. And it doesn’t matter if the program makes the NCAA tournament this year, or next, or the year after, because he knows it’s coming at some point. (Though, like everyone in Evanston, he’d prefer it happen this year.) \nEverything that Collins had laid out nearly four years ago in a job interview in Atlanta has come to fruition. \nNorthwestern got a much-needed resume-building win against Wisconsin. (Photo: Mary Langenfeld, USA TODAY Sports) \n“There was an instant connection between the two of us; I just knew, immediately, when we started to talk about philosophy and how you build it, what you envision Northwestern basketball being. It’s been a process,” Phillips said. “And Chris has gotten better each year. That, I think, has run in a parallel level to where the program has gone. Shoot, his first year here, he never called a time out, never put a starting lineup in there. He had never recruited a kid to come play for him. All that stuff was new. There's a learning curve that we all go through in those kinds of experience. I think that's what I really appreciate what I see with Chris. \n“He's a better coach now than he was when we first hired him. He's going to continue to be a better coach as he moves along. He's helped our program become better, and our program has helped him become better.” \nSaid Maryland coach Mark Turgeon: “I watched film of our game against them last year, and the development their players have made from last year to this year is amazing. … It’s going to be a great story as we move into March. An NCAA tournament team — they should be.” \n*** \nThe plan — the way Collins and Phillips explain it — isn’t simply to make the NCAA tournament once and watch that historical footnote change. It’s to make the NCAA tournament for the first time — of many times. \n“It hasn't changed,” Collins said. “When I took the job, the NCAA tournament was a steppingstone as part of the process. it wasn't about coming here and just taking a team to the tournament. And then saying, “OK, I've done my job.’ It was never the end goal. \n“To get to the end goal — which is being conference champions and hopefully eventually having the chance to go to a Final Four and all those things — well, you’ve got to go to the NCAA tournament to do those things. For me, it's always been a step in the process that we had to get to — and it's a big step —and there are a lot of people that are gonna be really excited.” \nMany already are. Carol and Neil Rowe, who graduated Northwestern in 1969 and 1970, respectively, have had season tickets for more than 30 years. \n“Every year Neil will say, ‘This is our year, this is our year,’ so we’ve always had hope,” Carol said, minutes before Northwestern tipped off against Maryland last week. \nSaid Neil: “We’re savoring every moment.” \nChris Collins, left, directing with Mike Krzyzewski during his Duke coaching days. (Photo: Chuck Burton, AP) \nCollins has said repeatedly he wouldn’t have taken this job if he didn’t envision this future for the program. He’s amped up recruiting and changed the style of play; Northwestern’s brand of basketball is more exciting than it’s been in decades. There’s a new video board in Welsh-Ryan Arena, and the entire arena is being renovated to reopen two years from now, with a state-of-the-art practice facility, too. \nCollins, who will forever be linked to Duke and pundits guessing at Krzyzewski’s eventual successor, seems to be in no rush to leave Evanston. He grew up near here, in the Chicago suburbs, and loves raising his kids here, too. Besides, he said, there’s no reason to think Northwestern can’t become a perennial NCAA tournament team, and a program that transplanted locals get behind — when the Wildcats aren’t playing their alma maters. Why wouldn’t fans adopt a winning college basketball team as their own? \n“I genuinely believe that this is where he wants to be, and that he wants to make this program his own,” said Mike Greenberg, co-host of ESPN’s Mike & Mike and 1989 graduate of the Medill School of Journalism. “We have all of the fundamentals in place for that to happen. We're going to have the facilities in two years. We've got the conference. We've got the proximity to the huge city. All we needed was the right person to put it all together — and he's here at the right time. I don't see any reason in the world why this can't become a genuine basketball powerhouse into the future. Obviously, the first step is making the tournament for the first time. \n“All the people that say, ‘Oh, Chris might use this as a steppingstone.’ — I really don't think so. I think in his mind we're going to have the facility, he's going to be able to win huge here and they're going to some day write his name on the court. You know, someday we'll be playing on Chris Collins Court in our new arena. I genuinely believe that is what's going to happen.” \nNo one can read Collins’s mind at this point, and no one truly knows what’s going to happen here in the future. But there’s no denying that he’s going to leave his mark on a program that desperately wanted and needed it. \n“That was a huge reason why I wanted to come here because I wanted to have that chance,” Collins said. “There are not many programs out there at this level that you have a chance to do something like this, to kind of create a legacy and create a program and do some things that have never been done. And to me, that was a big selling point.” \nNCAA TOURNAMENT BUBBLE TEAMS ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:55:13.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
