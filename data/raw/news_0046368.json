They say Donald Trump is unfit for the presidency. Photo: Christian Boone/AJC \nSeveral hundred “Not My President’s Day” protesters marched in Atlanta on Monday, arguing Donald Trump is unfit for the White House. \nThe rally was one of a number taking across the country Monday to coincide with Presidents’s Day. \nAbout 400 demonstrators in Atlanta walked peacefully from Arts Center in Midtown to Lenox Mall carrying signs and chanting \nFor Tristan Merediz it was his first protest. He’s 72. \n“I come from South America,” said Merediz, who has lived in the U.S. for 60 years. “Trumps reminds me of a dictator. The way he attacks the press, the way he attacks the people. Look at (Hugo) Chavez in Venezuela or (Evo) Morales in Bolivia. They’re all the same.” \nMerediz said he never thought he’d see such a leader assume the presidency but warned a dictatorship could be established here “if Congress doesn’t stand up to him. We’re heading that way.” \nTrump won Georgia in November and many of his supporters appear to be standing behind him. They like his push to crack down in illegal immigration and his choice of a staunch conservative for the U.S. Supreme Court. \nBut Trump has also inspired passionate opposition. Monday’s rally is the latest of several demonstrations against Trump, the largest being womens’ marches which drew hundreds of thousands in January. Atlanta’s rally drew some 60,000 people. Police estimate: 60,000 in Atlanta for the social justice march to the Capitol www.accessatlanta.com \nMonday’s event was not nearly that large. But it drew folks like William and Anna Hamrick, also first-time protesters. The couple drove down from Gainesville, where many of their Hispanic friends are living in fear of the new administration’s crackdown on undocumented workers. \n“Someone knocks on the door now and they’re afraid to answer,” said Anna Hamrick, 48. “These are working people, not criminals.” \nWilliam Hamrick, 56, said he’s never been that political but Trump’s ascension to the Oval Office “energized me.” \n“He’s really pursuing all those crazy ideas he campaigned on,” William Hamrick said. “The path he’s taken … it’s crazy. \nThere have been consequences to his newfound activism. \n“I’ve lost almost all my friends,” William Hamrick said. “My friends are rednecks and they love Trump.” \nCarrying a sign reading “We’re All in This Together,” Cameron Hawkins, 39, of Atlanta, said he felt “obligated” to attend Monday’s protest, sponsored by Democracy Spring Georgia. \n“There was the initial shock (after Trump’s election),” he said. “That turned into depression and now it’s frustration and anger.” \nBut Hawkins said he didn’t want to further the divide that exists in the country. Trump voters, he said, don’t feel as if they’re being represented, a complaint that spans ideologies and party affiliations. \n“We’ve got to get past this divisive rhetoric,” Hawkins said. “It’s scary. We’ve all been living in a bubble. We really underestimated how fast things can deteriorate.” The protests that have rocked Republican events across the nation arrived in Georgia on Friday when Donald Trump opponents turned a mundane “mobile office hours” with aides to three GOP lawmakers into a stand against the new president.
