Here’s What Happened When my BQ obsession started wreaking havoc on running and life’s pleasures, I knew I needed to make a change. By Emilia Benton Monday, February 13, 2017, 10:08 am On my way to a new PR, I learned how to relax and enjoy running again. Barret LaMond \nAs I crossed the finish at the 2015 Chevron Houston Marathon, I had just one thought: Why did I do this again? I was exhausted, depressed, and heartbroken. \nMy goal for that race was to chip away at my previous best time (3:58) with the intention of breaking 3:45. And with five marathons under my belt, my true goal was to run a Boston Qualifying time. Yes, I was driven. And I felt sure that if I put in the work, I would make it happen. But I wasn’t even close that day. In fact, I didn’t even break four hours.

I ran my first marathon at 23 (4:09:22 at the 2010 New York City Marathon) and as soon as my second rolled around, I, like many runners, got caught up in the desire to qualify for Boston ASAP. \nIn my second 26.2, I crashed and burned hard, finishing in 4:20:26. I decided to try to redeem myself at the 2012 Chevron Houston Marathon 10 weeks later, promising myself that I’d be happy with a reality-check sub-4 hour PR. I ended up doing just that, finishing in 3:58:29. And with that, I saw a glimmer of hope and, somewhat predictably, trained myself to near death over the next few years. \nDuring that time, I almost lost sight of who I was as a runner and why I run. \nMaybe it took years of miserable pounding to teach me the lesson, but after that disappointing marathon, I knew it was time for a change. I realized I was never going to break any records or win any races. No one would ever care about my performances or race results. And if I’m the only one who cares, I might as well be enjoying it. \nIt took me four years to achieve a new marathon PR, which was my 3:49:44 at the 2016 Chevron Houston Marathon. I credit that time to my ability to put my health and personal needs first. I learned that being obsessive in training could sometimes lead to poor results. And you know what? It was easy. I just needed to chill out. \nMileage-wise, less is more. It’s easy to get caught up in a comparison trap, especially in today’s age of social media. I based too much of my running on what I saw other people, including pros, doing. Because I had ten years of running under my belt, I thought I should've been doing some pretty heavy volume. I was stunned that I burned out when I tried to PR using a training plan that took me to a 60-mile per week peak. \nWith all that running, my legs often felt heavy and I could never hit the paces I should have been hitting in speed workouts. It was a terrible cycle. This is me at the 2015 Houston Marathon. It’s clear here that I’m suffering through the miles. Barret LaMond \nIn preparation for the 2016 Houston race, I purposely picked a lower mileage-training plan, in which I would peak at 45 miles a week. I was kind to myself and allowed my easy days to be easy. And wouldn’t you know, I felt fresh, rested, and like I was flying at mile 20, a first for me. \nPushing through pain, however minor, is never worth it. Like many recreational runners, I’ve had to learn this the hard way. After dealing with a metatarsal stress fracture in my foot in 2013, I was anxious to get back on my grind. I jumped right into marathon training almost immediately after kicking off the boot. \nOnce my foot was free, I amped up my miles. Within a month, I found myself lacing up my racing flats for a 10K. And then it happened. That terrible pop of pain in your lower leg. Calf strain. \nBut I kept going. It got progressively worse and worse. I never rested until it was too late and ended up sitting out both marathons I was registered for that season (I know, I was registered for two marathons in one season—also not right for my body so soon after an injury; I’ll get there). \nThree years later, on a dark and rainy run, I tripped over a curb and bashed up my knee. I ran to the chiropractor a few times looking for some special sauce to help me heal, but the pain returned in the days after. \nSo I made the decision to take a full week off and revised my plan from five days a week of running to just four for the remaining two months of training. With this rest, I was able to pull out a pain-free nine-minute PR. \nMissing a day, or even a week, of training won’t make or break your race. Let me repeat: Missing a day, or even a week, of training won’t make or break your race. \nIf it’s due to a potential injury, resting will obviously do you more good than harm. And if it’s due to a vacation or life event, just enjoy yourself and don’t fret! In hindsight, attempting speedwork on the beach over Christmas 2013 in Peru definitely wasn’t worth the effort–especially considering I ran the worst marathon of my life a few weeks later. \nWhen I was training for my current marathon PR race, my now-fiancé and I had the best intentions of getting a treadmill long run in during a vacation in Cancun. To this day, we still don’t know if the resort even had a gym. I definitely do not plan to prioritize marathon training during my wedding week in Mexico later this year. \nMarathoning once a year is more than enough for me Don't get me wrong—I’m definitely still itching to qualify for Boston. But I’m about to turn 30, which means I’ve still got up to four years to shave off the 14-plus minutes to get there. I’ve found that giving my body and mind an extended break to recover from the distance has helped me feel excited to jump into training when it comes around again, rather than burned out like I did when I tried doing both a fall and spring race (and sometimes two in the same season). \nWith the stress marathons put on my body, I like to put a hard effort into just one, rather than signing up for multiple just for fun. It doesn’t matter if you’re gunning for a PR or just trying to reach the end—running a marathon is freaking hard. \nWhen my once-a-year marathon ends up not being a PR (like this year’s Houston Marathon, which fell on an unseasonably hot and humid day), I’ll naturally feel disappointed, but I’ve found that the best way to cash in on a strong training cycle is to channel that work into shorter races. After all, smaller victories are still victories.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:32:39.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
