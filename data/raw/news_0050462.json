But what scared me was that moment, how would another woman who doesn’t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel? That was really interesting to me. I was kind of in shock. 'I can’t speak for what the purpose of it was. But it was jarring. I got double checked until she realised. No [I’d never had that before]. It was strange. It did [freak me out]. I’m from New York, born and raised. I was a little intimidated.' Lindsay was wearing the garment as she had flown from Turkey where she had met with the country's President, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Respectful: Lindsay was wearing the garment as she had flown from Turkey where she had met with the country's President, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan Happy: Lindsay was in fine spirits for her early morning appearance The star said she wore the item out of respect for the people of Turkey and kept it on at the airport because it made her less likely to be recognised. A representative for Heathrow told MailOnline: 'Heathrow respects the cultural and religious needs of all passengers travelling through the airport. 'We work hard to provide our passengers with great service while ensuring everyone remains safe and secure.’ Rumours have been circulating for some time that Lindsay has converted to Islam, however, she was coy when pressed by Piers. She said: 'I think that me studying the Quran is something I found solace in. You can't just convert to a religion overnight. I just study it, nothing is confirmed yet. 'Religion is a personal belief, my sister's a Buddhist. I don't want to speak on something I haven't finished yet. I find a solace in studying not just the Quran but meditation. Candid: The actress revealed the incident while speaking to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid on Tuesday's Good Morning Britain Looking good: The star wore a pink floral dress for her TV appearance 'The Islamic culture, I feel it's a family to me, they've been really good people to me. I want to learn the language so I can discuss situations with them (Syrian issues). It calms me. It's something I'm interested in.' The Mean Girls star also claimed US President Donald Trump should be given a chance by those protesting against him. 'It’s such a double edged sword, said Lindsay. 'I don’t agree with his policies and the things that he’s doing, but at the end of the day he is the President right now, so what’s the point in picking on someone instead of just seeing what they’re capable of or not capable of – I can’t speak on that because I’m not him, I don’t know what goes on, I’d love to be a fly on the wall in the Oval Office these days. Unexpected: She explained: 'When I was flying to New York recently. I was wearing a headscarf and I got stopped at the airport and was racially profiled for the first time in my life' 'People are making it overly dramatic. I do think his Twitter needs to be taken away or deleted. I just think you know, don’t kick someone when they’re down.' The star has made no secret of her desire for another Mean Girls film, and she said she 'hopes someone writes me back soon' so that the project can get underway. Her troubled past has been well-documented, with failed relationships and boozy tales almost overshadowing her film career. Shedding some light on the difficulties of growing up in the public eye, she said: 'People really like to harp on the past, that was over 10 years ago. Back to her best: The actress also reflected on her past personal issues 'I think also at the time when I was being hounded by paparazzi it was the beginning of this era. We didn't have Instagram or Twitter, it was the beginning of a phenomenon and I was left to my own devices which isn't great when you're young.' However, since turning 30, Lindsay has a new-found calm and outlook on life. She went on: 'When I turned 30 I always aspired for this, I always said when I turn 30 that will be the defining moment of what I want to do. I found a lot of solace I reached inside and what my intentions were in the world. Taking control of my life. Victim of her surroundings: She blamed a lot of her woes on the LA lifestyle 'I don't think it was ever turning to anything, it (drink) was very accessible when I was 16, 17, 18, 19. I had been working so much and surrounded myself with the wrong people going out drinking was the wrong thing to do. I didn't listen to anyone. 'My dad worked on the stock exchange, on Wall Street then he went away with Jordan Belfort (Wolf of Wall Street) and my mum was taking care of all of us and that must have been really difficult. 'I found therapy through acting. When I had the ability to leave and start my own life is when I should have listened to my mum. I think so (LA the problem). It moves so fast there, it's easier to surround yourself with any person than it is to be alone.'
