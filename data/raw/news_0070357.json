Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe coy but clearly delighted smile said it all as Cheryl proudly presented her baby bump to the world this week. \nAfter months of keeping mum, the singer, 33, confirmed her pregnancy – a long-awaited happy ending to her rollercoaster love life. \nDespite success as a pop star and X Factor judge, and her national treasure status, Geordie lass Cheryl’s ultimate goal has always been starting a family. \nAnd it seems One Direction star Liam Payne , 23 – who she helped make famous when he was a 14-year-old with a dream on a talent show – has become her knight in shining armour. \nEven in the heady days of Girls Aloud, Cheryl was resolute about her family focus. She said: “That’s going to be the highlight of my life, having children and settling down.” Read More Liam Payne and Cheryl, who shows off her baby bump (Photo: Getty) \nNow, she’s about to achieve that. \nThe shots of her at eight months pregnant in a L’Oreal and Prince’s Trust charity campaign, fittingly named All Worth It, have been released with a strong message to help young people find their own self-worth. \nNewcastle-born Cheryl reveals in a campaign video: “There was definitely a time when I struggled with self-doubt. Liam Payne and Cheryl (Photo: GC Images) \n\"I was teenager when I first experienced those feelings... doubting your decisions. I wasn’t doing very well at school at all. \n“There are moments in life where you might view things as failure, but they’re actually just learning curves so you can’t be afraid to fail. \n\"I’m definitely at a place where I don’t feel like I fail at things, I feel like I’ve learned.” Cheryl with her Girls Aloud bandmates (Photo: Getty) \nGrowing up as one of five, family has always been at the heart of Cheryl’s life. She is famously close to her mother Joan and her younger brother Garry, who she employs to travel with her when she’s touring. \nBut after two failed marriages, the future had looked uncertain for the singer – which is why her whirlwind romance with toyboy Liam came as such a pleasant surprise. \nIt seems the 1D star, who she started dating just over a year ago, came along at just the right time. Cheryl with ex-husband Jean Bernard Fernandez-Versini \nHe’d had his own struggles with fame, admitting: “I started drinking a lot and I began to get a bit tubbier. I was getting fat jibes all the time, which hurt me.” \nBut Liam’s maturity and reassurance has been a rock for Cheryl throughout the pregnancy, and she’s been impressed by his forward-thinking. \nAn insider says: “Liam is an old soul, with maturity beyond his years. He’s grounded and down-to-earth, having always been the ‘band dad’ when he was in One Direction. First husband Ashley Cole and Cheryl (Photo: Getty) \n“He had to grow up fast being away from home, so he’s more than ready and has been taking advice from pal Louis Tomlinson, who also has a baby.” \nInsiders say Liam and his pals have painted the nursery ready for the baby’s arrival and the star has been pampering Cheryl, making sure she doesn’t have to lift a finger in their North London home. \nOne insider reveals Cheryl is hoping for a natural birth at the exclusive Portland Hospital in Marylebone, West London – where Victoria Beckham had two of her children – and has been telling pals she’s “not too posh to push”.
