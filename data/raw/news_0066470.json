Are you freaking kidding me?\nShe added: 'You didn't even give my dog 24 hours, you didn't even give my dog 24 minutes.'\nThe foundation released a statement that said because Trouble didn't have a microchip and they were not able to contact his owner, they decided it was best to put him down.\nSmith said she was planning to get Trouble a microchip implant but insists he was wearing tags when he was picked up by animal control.\nThe foundation said that because Trouble didn't have a microchip, they weren't able to contact Smith and had the staff make the decision to put him to sleep.
