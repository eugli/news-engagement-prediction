It has long been seen as the guardian of Turkey's secular constitution. \nTurkey has a secular constitution dating from the days of Kemal Ataturk, founder of the modern republic, who did not like women covering their heads. \nWearing headscarves in public institutions was banned in the 1980s. \nThe issue has been controversial in Turkey for many years. \nSecularists regard the headscarf as a symbol of religious conservatism and have accused President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of pushing an Islamist agenda, converting many public schools into religious ones as part of his pledge to raise \"a pious generation\". \nBut the president argues that the ban is an illiberal vestige of the past. \nOver the past decade the ban has been removed for schools, universities, the civil service and in August for the police . \nThe BBC's Mark Lowen, in Istanbul, says the secular side of Turkey now feels largely ostracised, accusing Mr Erdogan of governing just for his conservative, religious support base.
