However, before the police could arrive, the two men took off. Their vehicle was eventually pulled over three miles away by a sergeant who investigated, but allowed them to leave after he failed to locate any guns.\nRelated In an Effort to Prove His Innocence, Florida Man Exposes Himself to Police A Driver Manages to Get Out of a Ticket After a Tree Falls on a Traffic Cop (Video) Michigan Traffic Cops Fail to Notice Body Inside of Pickup Truck-Two Days in a Row The two men, pissed off about being questioned, drove to a nearby police station to stage a confrontation that was certain to get them in far more trouble. One was identified as 24-year-old James Baker, who was carrying two firearms when he entered the station. The other was an unnamed 40-year-old man who was armed with a camera and tripod. According to FOX 2 Detroit, one of the men can be heard on the now- viral video saying, \"We felt a little afraid for our lives when we were pulled over, so we wanted to prove a point.\" Shortly afterward, police can be heard ordering them to the ground. After initially resisting the order, they were eventually taken into custody.\nYou can watch the totally bonkers actions of the two men in the pretty intense video below:\nAs FOX 2 also reported, after they were apprehended the two men were then found to be carrying a portable arsenal into the station:\n\"Dearborn police seized the loaded AP-14, a rifle magazine containing 47 7.62 rounds, a loaded Glock 19 handgun with four magazines that held 66 rounds, as well as their ballistics vests and body armor.\n\"Additionally the police seized an AK-47 style rifle and an AR-15 rifle.\"\nTo drive home just how stupid their little stunt was, even Open Carry Detroit contacted the police to condemn the duo&apos;s actions. As for their punishment, each man was free to leave after posting $1,500 bond. While the charges haven&apos;t been completed yet, they are currently facing three misdemeanors. Their court date is yet to be determined.\nTags: News , Videos , Guns , Michigan , Police , Traffic", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:05:56.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
