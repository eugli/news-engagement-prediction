Stephen Ruiz defensive standout, has maintained that drive. He is among the professional football and baseball players and NFL Draft prospects working out with trainer Tom Shaw at Disney World’s ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex.\n“I am out here with the mindset that I am going to get better every day,’’ Milano said last week. “I try not to look at the Twitter, the Instagram, all that stuff. I am just doing my job. Wherever I get picked up, I get picked up.’’ \nMilano, a 2016 All-ACC honorable-mention selection as a linebacker, is projected to be a late-round choice. Seventy-three days remain between now and the start of the three-day NFL Draft on April 27. \nMilano said he has been invited to the NFL Scouting Combine , set from Feb. 28-March 6 in Indianapolis, although an official invitation list has not been released. Boston College’s pro day is set for March 14. \n“It’s definitely a long process [until the draft],’’ Milano (6-1, 221) said. “People just want to go out there and play football. That’s not the whole process of it. You’ve got to take it day by day, and coach Shaw just said at the combine, they’re looking for what you do bad. They don’t look for what you do [well]. They already know that.’’ \nMilano started every game for BC in 2016, finishing with 58 tackles (11 for loss), 6.5 sacks, one interception and two fumble recoveries. He was selected the football team’s MVP. \n“Matt is quick and explosive, because he was an all-state safety when he came out of Dr. Phillips,’’ Shaw said. “I think when he gets to the NFL , he’ll play both [linebacker and safety]. He’ll end up covering and playing a safety, strong safety where he has to come up like [former Pittsburgh Steelers safety] Troy Polamalu in the box and play like that.’’ \nMilano is ready for any assignment. \n“I’m not a big entertainment guy,’’ he said. “I want to be where they need me.’’ \nCaption Magic's Aaron Gordon updates injury status \nOrlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon speaks to media before Monday night's game against the Miami Heat. \nOrlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon speaks to media before Monday night's game against the Miami Heat.
