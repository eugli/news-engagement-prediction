The 63 fundamental differences between British and American speech \"Allo guv'nor\" - how different is the American and English vocabulary?

Though Brits may think we speak the same language as our pals across the pond, this nifty little infographic shows just how many differences there are in our respective lexica. \nSome variations are simply a question of spelling (which Brits who use US spell-check will be aware of): “marvellous” in the UK becomes “marvelous” in the States, “travelling” becomes “traveling”. The image also highlights the variation in the our/or suffix (“colour”/”color”) and the re/re suffix (“litre/liter”). Source: www.grammarcheck.net \nOther vocab mismatches have the capacity to cause more confusion; “pants” are trousers for Americans, “biscuits” are a kind of savoury scone, “erasers” are used for removing pencil marks while “rubbers” are a form of contraception. \nMany British people will be aware of American terms such as “sidewalk” (pavement), “highway”(motorway) and “sneakers” (trainers) thanks to our exposure to American television series and films - or should that be \"movies\"? Generally there is less lexical awareness in the other direction. This may be compounded by the travel habits of our cross-Atlantic neighbours, of whom only 37% reportedly have a passport - though the UK is in the top 3 destinations for those that do travel abroad. \nPerhaps, thanks to Disney films and their aristocratic British villains or loveable cockney heroes, you may find that Americans' impressions of Brits are often of the Dick-Van-Dyke-chimney-sweep variety (see below). \nAlthough, according to some experts, American pronunciation of English may be closer to the way Brits spoke in the 16th century than the myriad accents and dialects that now exist in the UK, and Brits commonly used terms such as \"Fall\" for autumn . \nAnd despite many Brits being familiar with American culture, there are some linguistic mysteries that remain for us, that this infographic doesn’t cover; Who is Sasquatch? What actually is a “condo”? And why on Earth would you call a fringe, “bangs”? How Americans travel \nJust to add confusion, there’s Australian vocabulary to think of. Footwear, in particular, is known to cause confusion; note that what the Britsh call “trainers”, are known Down Under as “tennis shoes” or “joggers” while “thongs” are actually flip-flops. That last one might save you some embarrassment. \nFinally, it is worth noting that while English is the mother tongue for an estimated 335 million people, it is a second language for a more considerable 505 million, so the world’s most common variation of the language is actually “international English”. \nIf you have any other Anglophone vocabulary idiosyncrasies to report, please do let us know in the comments or on Twitter at @telegraphtravel.
