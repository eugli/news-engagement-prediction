Hannah Flint checks out Meghan’s new British social set THE ACTRESSES After a 15-year career in film and TV, it is likely Meghan will want to ingratiate herself with London’s thespian crowd. Cara Delevingne (left) and Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe Luckily for her, Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice are well-placed to help: both are patrons of theatres and count actresses Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe and Cara Delevingne among their inner circle. Jenna Coleman, Denise van Outen and Margot Robbie Should that fail, Prince Harry can offer Meghan assistance. His pals include Victoria lead Jenna Coleman, Suicide Squad ’s Margot Robbie and West-End star Denise van Outen, who claims Harry is her ‘favourite’ royal after they became friends three years ago. THE YOUNG ROYALS The role of Meghan’s biggest fan has already been assumed by Princess Eugenie, who has apparently described the Suits actress and Harry as the ‘perfect match’. She and Meghan are said to be friends following a double date to a masked ball at Soho House Toronto last year. The Duchess of Cambridge, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie Eugenie’s sister Beatrice won’t be far behind: she has a good track record of friendships with Harry’s girlfriends – she was pictured partying with his former flame Cressida Bonas at London nightclub Annabel’s weeks after the couple had split. As for Prince William? Harry introduced Meghan to his brother in November, but the actress would do better to impress his wife. Harry places an emphasis on the Duchess of Cambridge’s opinions and Kate’s meeting with Meghan last month was said to be ‘important’ to him. THE CLEAN CLIQUE It’s likely that vegetarian Meghan will find shooting trips too gruesome, so when Prince Harry hits the countryside fellow healthy eater Millie Mackintosh will no doubt be on speed dial. Millie Mackintosh, Pippa Middleton, Ella Mills The pair spent time at Soho Farmhouse, Oxfordshire, last year, with Meghan gushing on Instagram: ‘The best afternoon with Millie Mackintosh. So proud of you darling.’ Also in line for a catch up over courgetti could be Ella Mills, aka food blogger Deliciously Ella, who Meghan has described as ‘charming and real as they come’. But Meghan’s closest clean-eating confidante could be Pippa Middleton. Both foodies and yoga advocates, they are also dedicated to charitable causes (Meghan is a UN women’s advocate, Pippa is a keen fundraiser). A society dinner hosted by the pair is surely in the pipeline. MEGHAN’S SQUAD Despite her comparatively humble beginnings, Meghan is no stranger to high society. Misha Nonoo, Priyanka Chopra, Sophie Ellis-Bextor Her close friendship with designer Misha Nonoo – until recently married to Harry’s Eton schoolmate Alexander Gilkes – put Meghan within spitting distance of Harry’s crowd long before the couple met. Other starry BFFs include actress and philanthropist Priyanka Chopra and the singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor. THE SOCIETY WAGS Harry’s female inner circle is smitten with Meghan. Among them, Lara Hughes-Young, fiancée of Harry’s close friend Tom Inskip, has apparently been speaking of Meghan ‘in glowing terms’ since they met last year. Lizzy Wilson, Alessandra Balazs, Lara Hughes-Young Californian-born Meghan may also find allies in American Wags, including Guy Pelly’s wife Lizzy Wilson and Alessandra Balazs, the glamorous girlfriend of Harry’s friend Arthur Landon – the heir to a £200-million property fortune. Meghan and Alessandra will undoubtedly bond over their acting careers, travel (Meghan’s Instagram hashtags include #girlstrips and #vacations) and their shared love of fashion. Expect to see a friendship blossom over cocktails at Chiltern Firehouse – Alessandra’s father Andre is the London hot spot’s multimillionaire owner.
