Email SIMON HENDERY/FAIRFAX NZ \nDancing in the dark. The Jetstar counter at Napier airport \nâ€‹The couple were being taken to the airport by brother and sister and law Tony and Bev Wall when they got a text message from their daughter telling them the flight had been cancelled. \nREAD MORE: \nTony said their daughter had paid for their tickets, flights and accommodation and had just checked the JetStar website when she discovered the 1.30pm flight had been axed. JETSTAR/SUPPLIED \nJetstar has been approached for comment on the cancellation. \n\"We were there an hour before the flight was due to take off. They were just told it was cancelled without any explanation. They couldn't get another Jetstar flight because they're fully booked, and so were the Air New Zealand flights. \n\"And there were no rental cars available because Hawke's Bay is so busy with the Matatini festival,\" Tony said. \n\"There was a small crowd of very irate people there,\" he said. \nSo the four returned home and Robyn and Mike have taken their own car to Auckland. Ad Feedback \n\"They've been looking forward to this for months. They're huge Bruce fans and this was going to be a huge weekend for them, a huge holiday. They'd been looking forward to this,\" he said. \n\"They've been told they'll get a refund for the flight up but not for the return flight on Sunday, which won't be much use as they'll have to drive back,\" he said. \n\"It's hugely disappointing. Jetstar needs a rocket. They made a huge fuss when they started out of Napier in competition with Air New Zealand. Well Air New Zealand never behaved like this\". \nJetstar has been approached for comment. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:22:54.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
