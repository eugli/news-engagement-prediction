In fact, they’re part of eight teams (including the seventh and eighth seeds) that are separated by a total of just five games. \nNow at just past the halfway point of the long, 82-game regular season, anything can happen, especially given the number of injuries that Miami has had to deal with this year. \nIf those players get healthy and the team continues to play at a high clip, a playoff appearance isn’t out of the question. \nThat’s remarkable for a team that started the year 11-30. \nIf they somehow make the playoffs, it would be a shock if Spoelstra receive the Coach of the Year award, and rightfully so. \nWho needs LeBron after all?
