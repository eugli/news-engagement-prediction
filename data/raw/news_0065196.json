While violence keeps climbing, many are desperately searching for a solution to the problem. \nChicago’s murder rate returned to 1996 levels when the city was struggling with a drug epidemic and gang wars. The problem is now exacerbated by years of mistrust of police, leading to “ the withdrawal of some local communities [from cooperating with police] and police disengagement, ” as Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, told the Wall Street Journal.

In July, Black Lives Matter protesters ended up sharing a barbecue with Wichita police officers and discussing ways for their communities to work together. \nChicago and Baltimore officers have traveled to work with the NYPD, where a greater emphasis has been placed on officers to spend more time in communities by responding to smaller crimes or interacting with the neighborhoods they serve. \nIn Baltimore, Police Commissioner Kevin Davis plans to tackle the alarming violence by targeting repeat offenders. Last week the department agreed to a consent decree with the city government last week that allowed the police department to be monitored by a judge, but made no admission of wrongdoing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:44:16.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
