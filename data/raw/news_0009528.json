Russia ETFs traded publicly in the U.S. rose in reaction to the news.\nShares of the Market Vector Russia ETF Trust ( RSX ) gained as much as 2.2% soon after the news broke, and the iShares MSCI Russia Capped ETF ERUS surged 2.4%. The Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust ( RUSL ) jumped 6.2%.\nShares of all three ETFs settled back down later in the day but remained up modestly.\nRussian mining and steel company Mechel PAO ( MTL ) was up 1.67% to $6.10 in mid-afternoon trading Thursday. Shares of both Qiwi PLC ( QIWI ) and Mobil'nye Telesistemy PAO ( MDT ) were down.\nThe Treasury Department license , issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and signed by acting director Andrea Gacki, authorizes certain transactions \"requesting, receiving, utilizing, paying for, or dealing in licenses, permits, certifications, or notifications issued or registered\" with the FSB, including cyber security sales. It limits payments to the FSB to $5,000 per year.\nIt excludes activity having to do with the Crimea region of Ukraine, which Russia seized in 2014.\nU.S. intelligence agencies accused the FSB of involvement in the hacking of Democratic Party entities during the last election in an effort to undermine faith in the American democratic system, hinder former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump win.\nThe biggest beneficiary of the Treasury Department's move is not Russia but instead American companies that export to Russia.\nWhen the Obama administration strengthened sanctions against the FSB in December, it inadvertently hurt U.S. exporters that sell computers, phones, encryption tools and other technological items to Russia in the normal course of commerce. It barred companies from paying administrative fees to, seeking approvals from and even notifying the FSB in order to export to Russia.\nExportLawBlog in January noted the dilemma .\nPress Secretary Sean Spicer denied the White House was easing sanctions on Russia.\n\"We're not easing,\" he said. \"It's fairly common practice for the Treasury Department, after sanctions are put in place, to go back and look at whether or not there needs to be specific carve-outs for different, either industries, or products and services, that need to be going back and forth.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-russia-idUSKBN15H244", "http://www.exportlawblog.com/", "https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/cyber_gl1.pdf"], "published": "2017-02-03T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:09:03.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
