He was also ordered to pay $3,700 to the Hollywood Historic Trust, which maintains the Walk of Fame, and $700 to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which administers the attraction.\nHad he been tried and convicted, Otis faced a maximum penalty of three years in prison.\nTrump's sidewalk star on Hollywood Boulevard has been repaired at a cost of nearly $3,000, according to the chamber.\nThe Walk of Fame, a state-registered historic landmark and a leading attraction in Los Angeles' Hollywood district, features stars honoring 2,602 celebrities from five categories of entertainment - film, television, radio, stage and recordings. About 20 to 24 are added each year.\n(Reporting by Steve Gorman; Editing by Peter Cooney)\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:45:52.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
