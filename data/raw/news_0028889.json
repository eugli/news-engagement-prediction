The winners for the 70th British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Awards were announced at the Royal Albert Hall here. \nDev, known for Slumdog Millionaire , was nominated for the award with Aaron Taylor-Johnson ( Nocturnal Animals ), Jeff Bridges ( Hell or High Water ), Hugh Grant ( Florence Foster Jenkins ) and Mahershala Ali ( Moonlight ). \nHe had lost the Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role award to Aaron Taylor-Johnson at the 74th Golden Globes recently, but after getting a BAFTA Award, chances are high he may bag an Oscar too. \nPatel, who was suited and booted with a bow-tie in place for the ceremony here, had told IANS earlier: “I would be lying if I say that awards are not amazing. Awards can really change someone’s career. You get recognition. \n“You might get scripts that you didn’t get earlier. But I never took up a project thinking about a golden statue.” \nDirected by Garth Davis, Lion is based on Saroo Brierley’s best-selling autobiography A Long Way Home .

He experiences many challenges before getting adopted by a couple in Australia. Years later, he sets out to find his lost family. \nIn the Best Adapted Screenplay category, Lion was contending with films Arrival , Hacksaw Ridge , Hidden Figures and Nocturnal Animals .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:04:41.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
