Kobe Bryant, Magic Johnson (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:45 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:45 p.m. ET \nMagic Johnson wants to do a lot more than offer suggestions to the Lakers. \nHired this month in a role the team described as \"adviser,\" the Hall of Famer and longtime Lakers star says he wants to call the shots as he brings the Lakers back to prominence and he knows just the man to help them win. \nMORE: Magic: Lakers a superstar away from competing with Warriors, Spurs \n\"First call I make if I'm in charge? Kobe Bryant,\" Johnson said Tuesday on ESPN's \"First Take.\" \"Because Kobe understands winning. He understands, also, these players. I would call: 'What role you want? ... If you've got a day, just give me that day.' \n\"I'll take that. Whatever time he has, I want him to come and be a part of it.\" \nJohnson, who will be assisting Lakers president and part-owner Jeanie Buss as an adviser in basketball and business matters moving forward, thinks this Los Angeles squad is poised to be great â€” like Bryant and himself were when they won five championship rings during their careers as Lakers players. \nBut L.A. currently owns the second-worst record (19-37) in the Western Conference and needs help, either before the Feb. 23 trade deadline or the more likely option, free agency this summer. \n\"Everybody has to be on the same page right now,\" Johnson told ESPN.com on Monday. \"What we should be concerned about is not just right now, but how it will affect the future of the Lakers. That's why we all have to be on the same page.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:18:06.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
