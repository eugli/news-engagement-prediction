Photo: Nick Moir \nJustice Adamson said Sigalla was akin to a \"gamekeeper who poaches\" and \"helped himself\" to $8.6 million from TZ when it suited him. \nHe displayed an \"indignant\" and \"intransigent\" attitude during the criminal investigation and went to \"extraordinary lengths\" to conceal his wrongdoing, she said. \nThe entire board of TZ was replaced in June 2009. Sigalla was holidaying in the Bahamas two months later when lawyers for the new board wrote to him seeking an explanation for certain payments. \nBookmaker Tom Waterhouse gave evidence during the trial that Sigalla was a \"big punter\" who was \"known by all the bookmakers\" at the race track. \nJustice Adamson said Sigalla enjoyed a relatively \"privileged\" upbringing and had attended Sydney Grammar School until his Higher School Certificate. \nHe then studied economics and law at the University of Sydney but the court heard his life was also marred by tragedy. \nSigalla's legal studies were cut short when his much younger sister died and he was required to run the family business. \nSigalla's father died of a heart attack a year later and the family solicitor committed suicide after defrauding a number of clients, including the Sigalla family. \nBut Justice Adamson said no other sentence but a term of imprisonment was appropriate in the case in light of the seriousness of the charges. \nHis lawyer had conceded that his client did not believe he had done anything wrong. \nSigalla will be eligible for parole in November 2022.
