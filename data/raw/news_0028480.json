Be it a scintillating performance or orating her views on something, she is highly respected not just by her fans but even her fellow artists and contemporaries. \nReuters \nShe took the world by a storm when she announced her pregnancy on Instagram. While many speculated that she would miss the 59 th Annual Grammy Awards, her true fans knew on some level that the Queen won’t disappoint. Well, turns out she did not! \nreuters \nNot only did she give a hair-raising performance, she even came prepared with a powerful speech about something that is close to her heart - to empower \"every child of every race.\" Watch her acceptance speech here: Here’s the text of her full speech: Thank you so much. Hi baby. Thank you to the Grammy voters for this incredible honor, and thank you to everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep southern culture. I thank God for my family, my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter, my fans for bringing me so much happiness and support. We all experience pain and loss, and often we become inaudible. My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that would give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history. To confront issues that make us uncomfortable. \nReuters It’s important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first through their own families — as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House and the Grammys — and see themselves, and have no doubt that they’re beautiful, intelligent and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race. And I feel it’s vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes. Thank you again for honoring “Lemonade.” Have a beautiful evening. Thank you for tonight. This is incredible. Don't Miss ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:18:47.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
