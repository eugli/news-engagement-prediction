The 51-year-old Knight, who hasn’t seen his son in two years due to jailhouse regulations, called the policy both “cruel” and “unusual.” He also added that people who kill police are “treated like kings” and that people who murder children are given more time with their lawyers than he is as he pleaded for a “fair trial,” according to Courthouse News. Unlike other inmates, Knight is prohibited from meeting with his attorneys on weekends. \nHis son took to Instagram to express his outrage at his father’s current situation and lamented the fact the prosecutor seemed to rush through the former Death Row CEO’s case because “she has a lot to do today.” A post shared by Suge Jacob knight (@sugejknight) on Feb 22, 2017 at 12:20pm PST \n“Im grateful to see my dad this morning, but it hurts me to see him get neglected right in front of my face,” the mini-Knight wrote in the caption. “Im disgusted that these people take an oath to serve justice but do the exact opposite. I havent seen or heard this mans voice in two years! When will they view him as a human?” \nKnight was arrested in 2015 in connection with a fatal hit-and-run after prosecutors charged him for the murder of Terry Carter and attempted murder of Cle Denyale “Bone” Sloan, who had worked as an adviser on the N.W.A biopic, Straight Outta Compton. County prosecutors allege Knight ran over the two men with his pickup in the parking lot of the Compton restaurant Tam’s Burgers on January 29 after an altercation with Sloan, which Knight claims was self-defense, something the young Suge addressed in his post. \n“How come the man who turned himself in on a ‘Hit and Run’ case (Which is really a Self Defense Case) gets mistreated more than a Rapist or serial killer? I know sin is sin but what about mercy? I dont know anybody who can sit in solitary confinement for two years and not speak to, nor choose his own lawyer. When will they let him get the best chance to defend himself.” \nKnight is due in court for another pre-trial hearing on March 27, where he faces a life sentence in state prison if convicted.
