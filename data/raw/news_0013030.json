(AAP file image) \nEssendon players have reportedly had their cars stolen by baseball bat wielding intruders during a home invasion in Melbourne. \nPolice say four offenders armed with baseball bats broke into the Maribyrnong house early on Friday morning and stole wallets and keys before driving off in four cars. \nOne of the residents woke up after hearing one of the vehicles, a Volkswagen, crash nearby and saw a man jump out and get into another vehicle. \nIt's believed the offenders arrived at the property in a stolen Toyota Camry, which was later found dumped in Maribyrnong. \nThe Volkswagen stolen from the property has also been recovered nearby. \nThe other three vehicles, a Mazda and two Holden Commodores have not been found. \nThe cars belong to Essendon players, 3AW is reporting. \nThe Essendon Football Club has been contacted for comment.
