This can be achieved by opting for wireless earbuds such as the AirPods , but then that's something else you need to charge. Pioneer decided to come up with a better solution, and they called it Rayz Plus .\nBoth the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus only have one Lightning port, so Pioneer went ahead and integrated a second one into the cable of its new Rayz Plus earphones. That way, you can plug the charging cable into the earphones cable and continue to listen to music or chat while charging.\n\nThere's two models of Rayz available: the $99.95 Rayz and $149.95 Rayz Plus, and you're going to have to spend the extra cash as the charging port is only integrated into the Rayz Plus. That's a lot to spend of earphones, though, but thankfully Pioneer included a number of other useful features to help entice a purchase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:36:53.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
