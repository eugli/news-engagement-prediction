UNICEF 1 of 13 Emmanuel Kenyi, a 2.5-year-old child with severe malnutrition, sits on a bed while a nutrition specialist prepares his milk at the malnutrition ward of the clinic run by the International Medical Corps (IMC) in the UN Protection of Civilians (PoC) Our commitment to UK aid means that when people are at risk of dying from drought and disaster, we have the tools and expertise to avoid catastrophe Priti Patel \n\"These crises are being driven by conflict and drought and we must respond accordingly.\"Our commitment to UK aid means that when people are at risk of dying from drought and disaster, we have the tools and expertise to avoid catastrophe. GETTY The worry is that the aid will not get to the people who desperately need it \n\"In times of crisis, the world looks to Britain not just for our work on the ground, but also for our leadership internationally.\"While we step up our support for emergency food, water and life-saving care to those in need, our message to the world is clear - we must act now to help innocent people who are starving to death.\" GETTY It has been reported that four African countries could suffer from famine in 2017 \nIt is hoped the UK’s support to Somalia will provide emergency food and safe drinking water for up to one million people and emergency healthcare for 1.7 million people.In addition, The Department for International Development said: “Famine had now been declared in South Sudan with half of the population in desperate need. \n“Three million people have been forced from their homes because of violence and widespread rape.”Peacekeepers have earned a bad reputation for allegedly standing by during rape attacks by government troops on western aid workers in the South Sudan capital Juba last year. GETTY Patel described it as an 'unprecedented humanitarian crisis' \nOther allegations claim peacekeepers have failed to protect civilians who have been targeted in tribally-based violence that the UN has warned is close to genocide.An extra 100 troops were tasked with going to South Sudan after the region collapsed into war. They will be required to protect aid workers, western embassies and the UN.The peacekeepers may also be tasked with preventing the theft of aid to South Sudan where, during the 1990s civil war, armed groups stole 80 per cent of all food and fuel that was sent as humanitarian supplies.
