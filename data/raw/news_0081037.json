Wearer of the Silver Fern, dispenser of the haka.” \nNorquay said Williams’ status as an All Black was the reason he was in France playing for Racing 92, the defending Top 14 champions who have suspended the 35-year-old indefinitely over the incident.

He harmed the All Black legacy,” he added. \nWilliams is the second ex-All Black at Racing 92 to face trouble with the law after the legendary Dan Carter was caught drink-driving in Paris earlier this month. \nNewstalk ZB’s France correspondent Catherine Field said Racing 92 promoted itself as a family club and would have expected better from its high-profile recruits. \n“It’s not just a glamour club, it’s a club that’s really based around family... it’s really something that goes against the ethics of this particular club,” she said. \n“On top of that, there’s always a lot of interest in what the former All Blacks are doing here in France.” New Zealand lock Ali Williams performing the haka at Murrayfield.
