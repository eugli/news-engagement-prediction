Well, we got through about half the week before Donald Trump caused an uproar over his decision to withdraw protections for transgender students. The move, which his Education Secretary Betsy DeVos reportedly disagreed with, showed three key truths about Trump’s nascent presidency. \nFirst, the power resides at the White House. Trump isn’t showing deference to his Cabinet picks, as some in Washington had hoped he would. Two, Trump is continuing to deliver for his base. The order, which puts him squarely in the middle of the culture wars, will be extremely popular on the right, particularly among evangelicals who came out in big numbers for Trump. It’s also another example of Trump not caring about expanding his coalition. \nThree, Trump is using precious political capital to take on issues Congressional Republicans would prefer he ignore. They'd rather him use his juice to pass tax reform, or rewrite health care laws. As Republicans across the country continue to face screaming constituents at town halls, Trump's focus on transgender bathrooms doesn’t give them anything to say to people worried about losing their health care. \nNOTE -- Trump only tweeted twice yesterday. It seems like he's eased up on blasting his unvarnished opinions -- for now. Republican leaders have begged him to pump the breaks on Twitter.\nTHE NEWS OF THE DAY, NYT A1 -- “Trump Rescinds Rules on Bathrooms for Transgender Students,” by Jeremy Peters, Jo Becker and Julie Hirschfeld Davis: “President Trump on Wednesday rescinded protections for transgender students that had allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, overruling his own education secretary and placing his administration firmly in the middle of the culture wars that many Republicans have tried to leave behind. In a joint letter, the top civil rights officials from the Justice Department and the Education Department rejected the Obama administration’s position that nondiscrimination laws require schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice. That directive, they said, was improperly and arbitrarily devised, ‘without due regard for the primary role of the states and local school districts in establishing educational policy.’\n“The question of how to address the ‘bathroom debate,’ as it has become known, opened a rift inside the Trump administration, pitting Education Secretary Betsy DeVos against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Sessions, who had been expected to move quickly to roll back the civil rights expansions put in place under his Democratic predecessors, wanted to act decisively because of two pending court cases that could have upheld the protections and pushed the government into further litigation.” http://nyti.ms/2kPD3Tw \nGOOD ONE, STEVE -- “Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Sees Tax Overhaul by August : Economic growth at 3% or higher is also among Trump administration’s ambitious goals, he says,” by WSJ’s Rebecca Ballhaus and Nick Timiraos: “Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin laid out ambitious goals to secure a U.S. tax-code overhaul by August and to deliver economic growth at rates not seen in more than a decade. … Mr. Mnuchin said the administration was working with House and Senate Republicans to smooth over differences among them on tax policy, with the aim of passing major legislation before Congress leaves for its August recess. He added, ‘that’s an ambitious timeline. It could slip to later in the year.’ …\n“The House GOP plan doesn’t count solely on growth. It also features limited deductions and a border-adjustment provision that taxes imports and removes taxes from U.S. exports. The plan is projected to generate about $1 trillion over a decade. The border adjustment provision has run into criticism from large retailers and other importers. U.S. senators have piled on, too, leaving the idea in trouble without a major presidential push that hasn’t happened and might never come. Mr. Mnuchin said the administration is ‘looking seriously’ at the House plan that includes border adjustment and was well aware of concerns raised by specific industries. The Treasury Department had its own concerns, he added, ‘about what the impact may be on the dollar’ from a border-adjusted tax.” http://on.wsj.com/2l2UQ4Z \n-- COME ON, MAN! … -- This is the most ambitious timeline envisioned by the biggest optimists on Capitol Hill. Congress isn’t planning to turn its focus to tax reform until the summer, and this deal won’t get done in a few months -- mark our words. The 1986 tax reform bill was introduced in December of 1985 and didn’t get to Ronald Reagan’s desk until October of 1986. That was a much less partisan time, a simpler business climate and a world without Twitter and cable television. Here is some suggested reading, Secretary Mnuchin. http://amzn.to/2lyF0Ru \nON THE WORLD STAGE -- “Top U.S. Officials Get Chilly Reception in Mexico,” by WSJ’s Felicia Schwartz and Jose de Cordoba in Mexico City: “Top U.S. officials arrived for talks here Wednesday to find a defiant Mexican government refusing to accept President Donald Trump’s tougher immigration and deportation policies. ‘I want to make it emphatically clear that neither Mexico’s government or the Mexican people have any reason to accept provisions that have been unilaterally imposed by one government on the other,’ Mexico’s Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said at a ceremony on Wednesday. ‘We won’t accept it because we don’t have to,’ he added, in an apparent reference to U.S. plans to return illegal migrants to Mexico, regardless of their nationality. Mr. Videgaray’s declaration spelled trouble for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who a White House official said were sent to ‘talk through the implementation’ of Mr. Trump’s guidelines.” http://on.wsj.com/2kPv4Wv \nTHE NEW STATE DEPARTMENT -- “In first month of Trump presidency, State Department has been sidelined,” by WaPo’s Carol Morello and Anne Gearan: “The Trump administration in its first month has largely benched the State Department from its long-standing role as the pre­eminent voice of U.S. foreign policy, curtailing public engagement and official travel and relegating Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to a mostly offstage role. ... The most visible change at the State Department is the month-long lack of daily press briefings, a fixture since John Foster Dulles was secretary of state in the 1950s. The televised question-and-answer session is watched closely around the world, and past administrations have pointed proudly to the accountability of having a government spokesman available to domestic and foreign press almost every day without fail. Tillerson has also been notably absent from White House meetings with foreign leaders. ... Tillerson has not taken the usual complement of beat reporters with him on either of his foreign trips so far, opting instead for small ‘pools.’ ... The former ExxonMobil chief executive has made no speeches beyond a well-received address to State Department employees on his arrival and has held no news conferences.” http://wapo.st/2lNtbta \n--“Tillerson looking for ways to raise his public profile,” by Nahal Toosi: “Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has asked his aides to find ways to improve his media profile, a request that comes as U.S. diplomats increasingly worry about the direction of the State Department and whether their new boss has enough influence with President Donald Trump. A State Department official said Tillerson’s aides have asked staffers at the agency to draft a paper laying out ways he can engage with reporters, who have been given almost no access to the new Cabinet member. ... Meanwhile, several dozen Trump-appointed political staffers have arrived in Foggy Bottom, many of whom are still learning the ropes and are wary of engaging with the civil servants. ‘It’s like high school,’ said the State official familiar with Tillerson’s media request. ‘The Trump people all sit together at the tables at lunch.’” http://politi.co/2l23Jvs \n--“Rex Tillerson Is Already Underwater: In just a month, the tough-talking CEO has been pushed to the margins. Here’s how a potentially strong secretary of state can salvage his term,” by Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky in POLITICO Magazine: http://politi.co/2m9STbQ \nPALACE INTRIGUE -- “Trump’s open door Oval Office,” by Annie Karni: “When Omarosa Manigault, the former ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ antihero-turned-White House adviser, needs to talk to President Donald Trump, she simply strolls into the Oval Office. As assistant to the President and director of communications for the office of public liaison, Manigault enjoys what Trump aides refer to as walk-in privileges — meaning she doesn’t need an appointment or permission to pop her head in and consult with the leader of the free world. Her level of easy access marks a break from the previous administration, where President Barack Obama and his gatekeeper chiefs of staff kept at bay the number of aides, even senior officials, who simply walked in without an appointment. In contrast, Trump may have set up the most accessible Oval Office in modern history.\n“Along with Manigault, White House officials say, the list of aides with walk-in privileges includes chief strategist Steve Bannon, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, chief of staff Reince Priebus, son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, and counselor Kellyanne Conway. White House Counsel Don McGahn has walk-in rights, as does senior communications aide Hope Hicks, and Keith Schiller, Trump’s longtime private security aide who followed him to the White House. Trump’s new national security adviser, Gen. H.R. McMaster, is also expected to be added to the informal list, according to a White House official. Press secretary Sean Spicer, often accompanied by Priebus, is another regular visitor to the Oval Office, as is chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and deputy chief of staff for operations Joe Hagin.” http://politi.co/2kPAq43 \n-- CHRISTIE TURNED DOWN LABOR SECY: “Trump’s Apprentice-style hiring is upending Washington: The president goes on gut and instinct -- and he keeps offering Chris Christie jobs,” by Josh Dawsey and Eli Stokols: “After a meatloaf lunch at the White House last Tuesday, President Donald Trump made New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie an intriguing offer: Would he like to be secretary of labor? Christie said no, according to four people close to Trump who were briefed on the conversation, which was just the latest in a series of nudges Trump has given Christie about joining him in Washington. Christie has told Trump he is not interested and instead plans to join the private sector after he leaves Trenton next year, two people close to Trump said. ...\n“[Trump] cares, above all, about appearance, loyalty and a strength -- a word he often uses. ... While some of his choices are on a whim, he also likes to call dozens of people about potential hires, telling them what others said and asking them if they agree or disagree --and why. Last week, he asked TV anchors who visited the Oval Office for advice on filling the national security adviser position that opened up after Michael Flynn was ousted.” http://politi.co/2maE3ls \nA message from the Lift the Cap Campaign from Better Medicare Alliance: Millions of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are denied the full value of a high-quality Medicare Advantage plan because of a technical provision known as the Benchmark Cap.
