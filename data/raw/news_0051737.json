The field of candidates will be narrowed by March 20, and finalists must submit offers with their proposed costs by March 24. \nThe president told the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday that construction will start \"very soon\" and is \"way, way, way ahead of schedule.\" \nRELATED : Penzone asks DHS for guidance on 'immigration holds' \nThe agency’s notice gave no details on where the wall would be built first and how many miles would be covered initially. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly has sought employees’ opinions during border tours of California, Arizona and Texas. \nIt’s unclear how soon Congress would provide funding and how much. The Government Accountability Office estimates it would cost on average $6.5 million a mile for a fence to keep out people who try to enter on foot and $1.8 million a mile for vehicle barriers. There are currently 354 miles of pedestrian fencing and 300 miles of vehicle barriers, much of it built during President George W. Bush’s second term.
