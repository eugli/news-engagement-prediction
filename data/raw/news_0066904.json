Just because they're loud doesn't necessarily mean there are many, and I think, in a lot of cases, that's what you're seeing.\" \nAnxiety about health insurance is motivating many protesters, Spicer conceded, but those audiences also reflected \"a false narrative\" about Obamacare as well as confusion about how they would be affected by Trump's intended Obamacare repeal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T02:55:08.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
