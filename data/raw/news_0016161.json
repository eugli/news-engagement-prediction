The album also features a previously unreleased version of Sailing – a surprise find as it was not widely known she had recorded the track.\nThe record comes eight years after she became the oldest living artist to land a UK No 1 album and also marks 93 years in the industry. She will be joined on the album by British singers including Alfie Boe on We’ll Meet Again, Alexander Armstrong on White Cliffs Of Dover and Aled Jones on As Time Goes By. \nLynn said: “It’s truly humbling that people still enjoy these songs from so many years ago, reliving the emotions of that time. I was after all just doing my job as a singer – and it’s so wonderful for me to hear my songs again so beautifully presented in a completely new way.” \nThe singer will also celebrate her birthday with a charity concert showcasing some of the best of British talent at the London Palladium. Taking place on 18 March, the one-off spectacular will raise funds for her children’s charity and features Armstrong and singers Blake and Hayley Westenra.\nShe has previously described the prospect of reaching 100 as “an incredible adventure of song, dance, and friendship”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:02:37.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
