They prefer to wait until the summer.\" \nHis agent Mike Kjølø confirmed the agreement with City and says that his client can still achieve a big move in the summer if he continues his impressive form. \nHe added: \n\"It was a pity that there was an agreement with Manchester City in January, but there was great interest Ghayas from several clubs. If he continues to work hard, chances are that he will be sold in the summer window.\" \nSeen as the next big thing to come out of Norway, Zayid made 28 appearances for Valerenga in the latest season in Norway, scoring eight times and contributing further with seven assists. \nWatch the player in action here: \n<span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"></span><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"><br></span> Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T15:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T11:00:07.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
