No use without permission. More\nCressida Dick has been appointed Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police - becoming the first woman to lead the force in its 188-year history.\nThe 56-year-old, who retired from the Met as Assistant Commissioner three years ago, takes over from Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe , who has retired after five and a half years in the post.\nMs Dick, who first joined the Met as a constable in 1983 , beat three other shortlisted candidates, and was appointed after a round of interviews in front of the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd and London Mayor, Sadiq Khan.\nShe takes on the role at a time of intense pressure with the security threat at severe and violent crime on the increase across the capital.\nView photos\nCressida Dick - Credit: Colin Davey/REX/Shutterstock More Her appointment means three of the most senior figures in British policing are now women, with Lynne Owens, heading up the National Crime Agency and Sara Thornton, who lost out on the Met Commissioner job, the chair of the National Police Chief's Council.\nBringing vast operational experience to the role, Ms Dick headed up the force's anti-terror unit, before being controversially moved from the post by Sir Bernard in 2014.\nIn 2005 she was in charge of the operation which led to the shooting dead of Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell underground.\nAt a glance | Jean Charles de Menezes\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “Cressida Dick will be the first female Commissioner of the Met in its 187-year history, and the most powerful police officer in the land.\n\"She has already had a long and distinguished career, and her experience and ability has shone throughout this process.\n\"On behalf of all Londoners, I warmly welcome Cressida to the role and I very much look forward to working with her to keep our capital safe and protected.\nOn behalf of all Londoners I warmly welcome Cressida Dick as the new Commissioner of @metpoliceuk .
