Three different officers in uniform are present.\n'She can see parts of them and can hear their voices and she knows what they did to her,' she told WCPO on Monday.\nShe is now suing two officers, one by name and one as John Doe, as well as the jail's health administration services and six nurses in a lawsuit filed on Friday.\nShe alleges that upon entering the prison, she informed medical officials of her medical conditions, including epilepsy, as well as post traumatic stress disorder, battered woman syndrome, and depression.\nThe woman, who cannot be named, claims that the prison told her attorney that they were providing her medication, though they had not.\nHer attorney Jennifer L Branch said: 'In her cell she's put on her stomach. Three different officers in uniform are present'\nShe reportedly received a mental health evaluation on May 5, but was not given any of her necessary medications, and was not permitted to see a doctor.\nOn May 7, she began to experience seizures and exhibited 'bizarre behavior' and became unable to communicate and went unconscious. That day, she says the jail doctor ordered her to be given medication but the health administration services still failed to provide them to her.\nMay 9, she was found unresponsive in the shower, with her pupils dilated, mouth open and eyes rolling in the back of her head.\nShe was then taken to a hospital for treatment, though one of the prison nurses falsely reported that she was suffering from withdrawal, and did not provide any medical records or information on the victim's condition.\nThe lawsuit alleges that the prison's health service administrator told the head of the jail that the victim wasn't having seizures and was just 'playing them'.\nOn May 10, she was taken to a Atrium Medical Center after remaining unresponsive, where a urinalysis was conducted and sperm was found inside of her.\n'The only way she would've had that is if it happened at the jail,' Branch continued.\nIn the three days following her second hospitalization, she became 'catatonic and psychotic', before finally being released from the prison to Summit Behavioral Center.\nOne of the officers she accuses of sexual assault claims the two had consensual sex.\nOn May 10, 2013, she was taken to a second hospital after remaining unresponsive, where a urinalysis was conducted and sperm was found inside of her\nThe lawsuit asserts that 'her incoherence, lack of consciousness, and inability to communicate due to her untreated medical conditions left her vulnerable and unable to defend herself from rape or sexual assault.'\nThe sexual assault was investigated by another law firm, and the FBI became involved, but no charges ensued.\n'The case was filed by another law firm and after about six months they dismissed the case. They didn't give a reason,' Branch said.\nMuch of the forensic evidence had been destroyed after the prison disposed of her mattress, and investigators additionally not collect evidence from her clothing or cell.\nThe prison issued a statement in response to the civil suit.\nIt said: 'The Warren County Sheriff's Office does not comment upon pending legal matters. We believe strongly in pursing legal matters through the Courts, not the media.\n'However, none of the citizens of Warren County should take our silence about the lawsuit filed by one of our former inmates as an indication that there is any truth to her allegations. We look forward to defending this case to a conclusion.'", "external_links": ["http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/warren-county/prisoner-says-warren-county-jailers-raped-her-nurses-refused-to-give-her-epilepsy-medication", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/31/god-please-help-me-inmate-claims-jailers-raped-her-refused-medicine-and-left-her-catatonic/?utm_term=.e1002b9786fe", "http://assets.scrippsdigital.com/cms/videoIframe.html?&host=assets.scrippsdigital.com&title=Suit%253A%2520Woman%2520raped%252C%2520tortured%2520at%2520jail&vid=588fcd5d4714e36a0c727617&purl=/embed/embed&story=0&ex=1&s=wcpo"], "published": "2017-01-31T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T13:42:13.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
