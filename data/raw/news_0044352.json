You sometimes wonder how they got to do what they do. They come in all shapes and all sizes. Cristiano Ronaldo: tall and muscular. David Silva: small and nimble.\nThey're not all like that. Not all built to sprint down the wing or use a low centre of gravity to help control the ball in tight positions.\nSome, just some, are built like Lincoln City's Matt Rhead. Burly. There hasn't been a ground he's played at where the opposition fans haven't berated him in some way. Jeered because he looks too big to be a footballer. 'You fat b d, you fat b d,' the Burnley fans sang here.\nMatt Rhead led the line superbly as Lincoln upset the odds against Burnley on Saturday\nRhead kept Burnley's defence occupied all afternoon as Lincoln won 1-0 at Turf Moor\nHe used to build JCB diggers before he stopped to become a professional footballer at the age of 28 – just four years ago.\nNational League defenders are used to being bulldozed by him and Burnley's Premier League stars didn't take too kindly to him either on Saturday.\nJames Tarkowski and Micheal Keane would have had an idea what they were going to be up against when they did their preparation.\nThe 32-year-old striker clashed with Burnley midfielder Joey Barton on a number of ocassions\nBut what they wouldn't have been expecting is how much of a pest he would become. Joey Barton won't be becoming his friend any time soon either.\nCrammed into The David Fishwick Stand were over 3,000 Lincoln fans. They love 'Rheady' at Sincil Bank and it's easy to see why.\nHe winds opposition fans up, gets above the opposition defenders and certainly isn't bothered about leaving a boot in.\nBarton falls the floor despite minimal contact from Rhead during the second-half\nBut it was when Barton left a boot in on Rhead that things became a bit heated. They had been bickering throughout the first half and in the second the temperature was ramped right up.\nHe charged down Barton when the experienced midfielder dawdled on the ball. Barton didn't like that and gave the striker a glare. Rhead stared straight back as if to say he'd have to do much more to scare him than that.\nAnd while that was all happening Rhead was still able to get forward and flick the ball on. That's primarily his job – just develop the attack, hold the ball up and draw defenders.\nRhead squares up to Barton during a feisty second half of football on Saturday afternoon\nTwice he had Tarkowski and Keane worried. The ball went up to him, he held off Tarkowski and flicked on to strike partner Jack Muldoon. It happened again a few minutes later. Again he got it to Muldoon but he couldn't direct his shot goalwards.\nAs the game wore on Rhead dropped deeper and it was from that position he found himself in Barton's territory.\nThe inevitable happened with 30 minutes left. Lincoln had built down the right. The ball found its way into the Burnley penalty area and Rhead and Barton came together. Barton theatrically went down but seconds later replays showed that actually the 34-year-old had stood on the striker's foot. To avoid punishment it seemed as though Barton thought it best to play dead.\nSean Raggett scored the only goal of the game to send Burnley through the next round\nIt got worse eight minutes later. Lincoln started to up the ante, sensing they had a chance to win and central midfielder Alex Woodyard had become the focal point in their midfield.\nIt was Woodyard who took the ball forward and he was clattered down by Jon Flanagan. Naturally, Barton got involved. Of course he did. For his involvement, which included getting up close and personal with both terrier-like right back Bradley Wood and Rhead, Barton was booked for his behaviour and rightly so.\nHe was embarrassing on a day when his team-mates needed him. His yellow card meant he went off the boil. He wasn't able to throw his weight around as much and Lincoln took advantage.\nRhead went off to rapturous applause from the Imps supporters. He'd riled yet another defence and also, as a treat, Barton too.\nRaggett is swamped by his team-mates after securing a famous victory at Turf Moor", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:10:33.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
