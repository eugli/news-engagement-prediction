Concerned Nigeriana \n@Vextra: \nMuhamadu Buhari is the worst president Nigeria has ever had; the least educated, the most dishonest, the most crooked, the worst mentally lazy, the most bereft, the most denuded of thought-process, and, the most inarticulate stammering Islamist bigot ever to enter the presidential villa flying Fulani tribe flag. We dey hear \n“Nigeria’s inflation has risen to 18.55 per cent, its highest in more than 11 years, according to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). all major food sub-indexes increased, with soft drinks recording the slowest pace of increase at 7.66 percent (year on year). Added to this, communication, restaurants and hotels recorded the slowest pace of growth in December, growing at 5.33 per cent and 8.91 per cent (year-on-year) respectively. \nThe Nigerian crisis has even long spread to global airlines. In the latest illustration of the economic crisis engulfing Nigeria under Buhari, United Airlines had discontinued daily flights between Lagos, the commercial capital, and Houston in the US whilst Iberia, the Spanish airliner, cancelled all four of its weekly flights to Nigeria last May.” \n……….Newsreports", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:35:02.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
