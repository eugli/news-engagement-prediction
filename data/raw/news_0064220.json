Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA scientist sacked from The Christie for failing to ensure blood transfusion equipment was properly cleaned has been struck off. \nHema Shah worked in the Blood Transfusion Laboratory at the Christie Pathology Partnership and was in charge of supervising biomedical staff. \nIn 2014, concerns were raised by colleagues about the standard of her work and as a result Ms Shah was dismissed. \nThe case was referred to the Health Care Professions Council (HCPC) and an investigation was launched.

The Christie (Photo: Manchester Evening News) \nHCPC panel chair Stephen Fash said: “The Panel is of the clear view that the findings made against Ms Shah by the final hearing Panel in August 2016 were very grave indeed. \n“They had very serious implications with regard to patient safety, and significant consequences for her relationships with staff for whom she was responsible.” \nA spokesperson for The Christie says that ‘at no time’ did Ms Shah’s actions result in patient harm \nThey added: “Concerns were raised internally about Hema Shah’s work in July 2014. Under the organisation’s robust disciplinary procedures she was investigated for failure to follow correct process across a number of responsibilities and tasks. These included failure to maintain appropriate training records and stock taking issues.

The internal investigation identified there were sufficient lapses in following correct process that it warranted dismissal and Ms Shah was dismissed from the Christie Pathology Partnership in September 2014. \n“As required, this was reported to the regulator the HCPC.” \nMs Shah was neither present nor represented at the hearing.
