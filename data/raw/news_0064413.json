Four imaginative, chef-driven salsas grace the menu. Each brings something unique to the table. There's a satisfying charred tomato salsa shot through with onion, serrano chile, garlic, lime and cilantro; a vibrant salsa verde (tomatillo and serrano) with just the right amount of fresh green flash; Jalisco Vinegar (a tangy wallop of tart heat laced with subtle flavors of toasted seeds, baking spices and chile de arbol potency); and Cranberry Picosa (fruit forward sweetness slammed by a habanero scorching). Multiple salsas? Four -- count 'em -- four. Free: $3 for one; $8 for three; $10 for all four. Chips: Made in-house; they're warm, satisfying corny comfort. Grade: Excellent. Other: A favorite place to drink downtown. But don't confuse the gastro-cantina with a margarita mill; El Big Bad has some wonderfully rich, satisfying, true-flavors cooking going on. less EL BIG BAD Address: 419 Travis, 713-229-8181; elbigbad.com Salsafication: El Big Bad goes El Big when it comes to salsa.

It's the kind of personal, familial elixir your favorite tia might have made -- a brilliant kitchen salsa with vivid, satisfying flavors. Plenty of chile sting, tomato and fresh cilantro brightness, and a slightly rough, scoopable texture that have you consuming a bowl even before your second beer arrives. Multiple salsas? Just the red. Free: Yes. Chips: Fine chips but they could have served us cardboard; we'd use whatever vehicle to attack this hot, homespun charmer. Grade: Excellent. Other: Chapultepec is open 24 hours so you can get at this wonderful salsa whenever the craving hits you. less CHAPULTEPEC LUPITA Address: 813 Richmond, 713-522-2365 Salsafication: This no-frills, combo plate joint offers some darn tasty salsa.

The green seems more emulsified than the original Ninfa's on Navigation but no less crave-inducing. The red, though, is a thing of beauty -- a vivid, tomato-forward sauce that is visibly potent and full of flavor. It's not terribly chile hot but it is as well rounded a red as you can get. Multiple salsas? Both green and red served automatically. Free: Yes. Chips: Abundant crunch replaced automatically and often. Grade: Extraordinary. Other: It's hard to believe that the restaurant's insanely enormous menu is delivered in such top-notch fashion. But it is and that's why El Tiempo, for many, is the ultimate go-to Tex-Mex. less EL TIEMPO CANTINA Address: Multiple locaitons; eltiiempocantina.com Salsafication: The fact that this brand comes from Mama Ninfa's talented clan is assurance enough that you're getting authentic Houston salsa ... more Photo: Greg Morago Image 5 of 64 SYLVIA'S ENCHILDA KITCHEN Address: Three Houston locations; sylviasenchiladas.com Salsafication: The red salsa is served so hot the bowl was steaming at the table. There must be a cauldron in the kitchen gurgling with this humble brew that sports visible feathers of tomato skin and roasted flecks. This is a loving, mama-style salsa that isn't chile hot but pleases with its homey, flavorful goodness. Multiple salsas?: Not advertised but there's a habanero version of this table salsa; ask for it if you need the heat. Free: Yes. Chips: Hot, thin yumminess. Grade: Very good. Other: Owner Sylvia Casares (known as Houston's Queen of Tex-Mex Cuisine and/or Houston's Enchilada Queen) is a born educator. Her cooking school classes help preserve Tex-Mex culinary traditions. less SYLVIA'S ENCHILDA KITCHEN Address: Three Houston locations; sylviasenchiladas.com Salsafication: The red salsa is served so hot the bowl was steaming at the table.

That offers an option not available at table-service restaurants. Using the ladle you can decide on how saucy or chunky you want your salsa. The large diced veg in this tomato-forward salsa tastes super fresh and complements an order of Berryhill's famous tamales. But those looking for heat will be disappointed. Multiple salsas?: No, but there is a ranch dressing/sauce on the salsa bar, as well as several hot sauces and a chunky pickled carrots and onion. Free: Yes. Chips: Thick cut and probably tasty if they didn't spend so much time of their time under a heat lamp. Grade: Good. Other: The salsa may lack heat but not so the Killer B cookies, one of the chain's dessert options. The chili-flecked cookies -- a take on a pecan sandie -- are delicious and deceptively spicy. less BERRYHILL BAJA GRILL Address: Eight Houston-area locations; berryhillbajagrill.com Salsafication: A self-serve salsa bar is one of the signature features of this Houston-born chain.

The salsa trio here features Salsa Tia Martha (a green tomatillo version sporting an unexpected undertow of crushed peanut); Salsa de 5 Chiles (toasted chile heat enriched with porky chicharrones); and Salsa Quemada (a bold, fragrant stunner boasting “burnt” arbol chile skin). Multiple salsas? Three, and they’re all fabulous. Free: No, $9. Chips: They call them tortilla “fritters”; we call them chips. Grade: Extraordinary. Other: Last year Cuchara has an in-house salsa competition among six mothers who cook at the restaurant called La Mejor Salsa de Mi Mama. They were all salsas the cooks had learned from their mothers and grandmothers. It was magisterial stuff. The salsa program alone is reason enough to love Cuchara. less CUCHARA Address: 214 Fairview, 713-942-0000; cuchararestaurant.com Salsafication: A grand, verging on baroque salsa presentation of ridiculously delicious salsa flavors you won’t find anywhere else in Houston. ... more Photo: Staff Photo Image 8 of 64 SPANISH FLOWERS MEXICAN RESTAURANT Address: 4701 N. Main, 713-869-1706; spanishflowersrestaurant.com Salsafication: Spanish Flowers is a Houston institution but its salsa is bewilderingly weak. Chunky, yes, but bland and watery. There is practically no chile flavor in this soupy, almost tinny tomato brew that does little to please salsa fans. Multiple salsas? Only red was served to us. Free: Yes. Chips: Flavorless.

It separates a bit if left alone but there's no threat of that because it sports a nice chile kick; you want to keep eating. The green is better -- a deceptive pale-colored sauce that offers clean flavors of lime, cilantro and green chile brightness. Multiple salsas? Yes, both red and green are distinguished salsas. Free: Yes. Chips: Light, warm and crispy but we added some salt. Grade: Very good. Other: The restaurant has a great atmosphere where family gatherings and obvious regulars are happy to call home. The nachos are great and the guacamole fantastic. less TEOTIHUACAN MEXICAN CAFE Address: Three locations in Houston; teomexicancafe.com Salsafication: The red is a warm, flavorful mash with specs of roasted tomato.

The boggy chile stew served at this serious downtown mezcal bar takes no prisoners. It is unapologetically combustible with ferocious chile heat. A red, tomato-based salsa, it almost tips to green in color for all its nearly flammable chile glory. We've asked what's in it, they won't tell. But whoever is making this fierce, verdant sludge is a salsa master. Multiple salsas? Nope, but this one practically straddles two worlds. Free: $5.99 for chips and salsa. Chips: Get rid of them. The awful, red/white/blue supermarket tortilla chips are unworthy of such glorious salsa. Deserves so much better. Grade: Extraordinary. Other: The chicken and pork tamales served here are dreamy. We also like the queso. And that's it for food at this bar that boasts what is surely the state's most intelligent agave spirits program. less THE PASTRY WAR Address: 310 Main, 713-225-3310; thepastrywar.com Salsafication: Swamp creature.

The color may be anemic but those peppers sure aren't. The burn just builds, in a good way. Multiple salsas? Not a salsa, but there is second condiment that often comes to the table automatically. The jalapeño ranch dip is addictive and soothes any residual burn from the salsa. If it doesn't appear, just ask. Free: Yes. Chips: So light and thin that they often make the chunky salsa a challenge to eat. Grade: Good. Other: The complimentary fully loaded nacho bar at happy hour is one of the best deals in town. less CHUY'S Address: Eight Houston-area restaurants; chuys.com Salsafication: The chunky concoction that Austin-born Chuy's delivers with its chips is related more to pico de gallo than salsa.

A loose brew, its components are obvious: discernible, real tomato, onion and chile seeds. We had to ask for squeeze bottles of the green and one taste assured us that this is fiery fuel of the salsa gods. It's incendiary, intense stuff that will blow you away if you're not using it sparingly. But for those who crave the zenith of salsa heat, this green is chile heat heaven. Multiple salsas? Yes. Delicious red and powerful green. Free: No, $2 for basket of chips and salsa. Chips: Warm, and house made. Slightly greasy but we appreciated the fresh, hot chips effort. Grade: Excellent. Other: A popular spot for obvious reasons: fresh flour tortilla tacos, abundant portions, fresh ingredients and Mexican realness in the kitchen. less CHILOSO'S TACO HOUSE Address: 701 E. 20th, 713-868-2273; chilosostacohouse.com Salsafication: The red is a wow: an honest, homey sauce sporting intense chile flavor.

The red sits nicely on chips and sports an almost perfect body and texture. It's textbook red that effortlessly balances the tomato/chile equation. The tomatillo green also nails the texture department; flavor-wise it's got it all going on: tang, just the right amount of heat and easy likability. Multiple salsas? Everyday salsa, red and green, should be this good. Free: Yes. Chips: Good, standard crunchers. Grade: Very good. Other: Unfussy go-to Tex-Mex doesn't aim to outperform in the standard repertoire. And that's probably part of La Tapatia's easygoing charm. less LA TAPATIA Address: Multiple locations in Houston; latapatiahouston.com Salsafication: Within seconds of sitting down you are met with a big, welcoming bowl of chips and both red and green salsa.

TAQUERIA Address: 4902 Kirby, 713-520-9153; goodecompany.com Salsafication: We might wish for more capsaicin sting from this loose-textured red salsa but it's the kind of sauce you want to pour every everything -- your taco and fajita dinners, midges and all the other huevo-based day-starter options. With its discernible roasted its and mild tomato goodness, this is a serviceable salsa that can please all palates. Want more chile kick? Load up on the free pickled jalapeños. Multiple salsas? Red's the word here. Free: Yes. Chips: Nice, friendly chips. Grade: Very good. Other: The Goode quality stamp is at play here as it is throughout the Goode family brands.

Chef Hugo Ortega uses the chile pods with seeds and veins intact for more capsaicin oomph. A pulpy room-temperature mince, it’s flecked with green chile and cilantro bits, deepened by onion and the garlic that is one of Ortega’s favorite salsa touches. Those spindles of tomato skin bristling here and there? Proof that fresh tomatoes have been roasted to make the salsa, which intensifies the flavors. Multiple salsas? Yes, many and varied, made to go with specific dishes. One of Ortega’s newest potions is the salsa macha, an evil-looking blackish sludge gritty with solids: garlic shards, sesame seeds, cilantro seeds, dried red chiles. This specialty of Veracruz hits with a toastiness followed by a note of sweetness and then bam! Sudden, throat-catching heat that hurts so good. The avocado-tomatillo green salsa is killer stuff, beautifully coarse and bright with hunks of tart tomatillo and a controlled flare of green chile heat that lingers on the tongue. The avocado component subtly mellows the effect. Free: No. Order the salsa Mexicana for $7 with totopos and guacamole. Salsa macha comes with roasted cauliflower salad; avocado-tomatillo salsa comes with Tacos Dorados, soft little folds of puffy fried potato. Chips: Sturdy house-fried totopos that emit a sharp crack with each bite. Grade: Extraordinary (Mexicana, macha and avocado-tomatillo). less HUGO’S Address: 1600 Westheimer; hugosrestaurant.net Salsafication: The sole table salsa, meant to accompany the house-fried totopos, is a salsa Mexicana so lively and fresh tasting and soft that it fools you ... more Image 16 of 64 LAST CONCERT CAFE Address: 1402 Nance, 713-226-8563; lastconcert.com Salsafication: It might not be the first place that comes to mind when you're craving Tex-Mex (and that's your own fault) because you'll have a rewarding experience when you want to get on with a chips and salsa throwdown. The salsa here is good-natured: bright red tomato flavor churned with abundant cilantro and serrano pepper. It's made daily and you can tell from its direct, clean, fresh impact. It's the kind of salsa you wish you could make at home and would taste just as good. Multiple salsas? No. Free: Yes. Chips: Good, workman-like chips. Grade: Very good. Other: You'll have to knock at the red door to gain entrance but Last Concert is as unpretentious and welcoming as they come. In a city that has a high tolerance for artifice, this hippie, be-yourself cafe puts on zero airs, making it a true come-as-you-are social hall for dependable Tex-Mex and uncontrived atmosphere. less LAST CONCERT CAFE Address: 1402 Nance, 713-226-8563; lastconcert.com Salsafication: It might not be the first place that comes to mind when you're craving Tex-Mex (and that's your own fault) because you'll ... more Photo: Greg Morago Image 17 of 64 CYCLONE ANAYA'S Address: Multiple Houston locations; cycloneanaya.com Salsafication: Tomato bomb. And we mean that in a good way. The salsa here is so tomato forward it almost feels like an Italian marinara. It's got great body and mild heat but it's darn tasty, addictive even. Multiple salsas? If they have a green, we don't know about it. Free: Yes. Chips: Nice, crispy, plentiful. Grade: Very good. Other: We love the wrestler story at the heart of Cyclone Anaya (and the Midtown store is one of our favorite places to spend a chips and salsa afternoon). less CYCLONE ANAYA'S Address: Multiple Houston locations; cycloneanaya.com Salsafication: Tomato bomb.

It doesn't carry a lot of heat; it's watery too, which may be a let down to those who like to drown their tacos with a traditional blended salsa. Multiple salsas? Instead of offering a second salsa, Lupe serves a bowl of charro beans. Warm, satisfying, and a nice, unexpected touch. If you want extra heat with your food, ask for a mess of their delicious pickled jalapeños. Free: Yes. Chips: Light as air and addictive. They'll bring you as much as you can crunch down. Grade: Just OK. Other: Lupe's fajitas, which sport a special taste, have earned legions of fans. less LUPE TORTILLA MEXICAN RESTAURANT Address: Multiple locations; lupetortilla.com Salsafication: Not really a traditional table salsa at all, Lupe's chip dipper is really more a pico de gallo; a chunky salsa ... more Photo: Greg Morago Image 19 of 64 HABANERA & THE GRINGO Address: 9902 Interstate 45; habagringo.com Salsification: Brightened with both lemon and lime and rounded with garlic, the red table salsa resembles a marvelous, slightly soupy pico de gallo. Meticulously chopped tomato, onion and jalapeño impart a fine fresh texture, and cilantro adds an herbal twinge. Multiple salsas? No. Free: Yes. Chips: Sturdy and house-fried, they snap, crackle and pop. Grade: Extraordinary.

It’s thin and soupy, shot through with onion and a sudden wall of jalapeño heat strong enough to clear sinuses. It’s not about depth or nuance; it’s about feeling the elemental burn.

Flecks of charred chile and plenty of seeds keep the slightly puréed texture real. Salty, tart and dusky, it’s hard to stop eating. Mutiple salsas? Yes, three. The good basic tomatillo green salsa hits with a quick flare of green-chile heat; and the dark, blackened Salsa Tatemada strikes with a major delayed sear that can make your nose run. Free: Yes. Chips: Thinny-thin and brittle. Grade: Excellent (Picosa); good (tomatillo and Tatemada).

But surprise: The base is roughly puréed pineapple, and the salsa comes on all innocent sweetness, followed by sneaky green chile heat, an edge of cilantro and a savory note of onion. It seems odd and insipid at first blush, until the heat kicks in. Then, despite your better judgment, you’re hooked. Multiple salsas? Yes. Pueblito made its name originally with that pineapple salsa, which caused a stir when the restaurant opened as El Pueblito Place in 1997. But the red table salsa is even better. A cool, rough tomato purée that creeps up on you with a big front-of-the palate sear that migrates to the back of the throat as the heat subsides, it has a nice balance of salt, tartness, cilantro and onion flavors. Free: Yes. Chips: Deep-gold, medium-thick, slightly bubbled surface. They’re decent-quality commercial specimens but nothing special. Grade: Good (pineapple); very good (red salsa). Other: Despite the outrageous charms of the big Las Vegas pool-club-style patio — complete with draped semi-private dining pavilions, huge palms and a waterfall — the vaguely coastal Mexican food here is so-so at best.

Chronicle food experts Alison Cook, Syd Kearney, Greg Morago and Jody Schmal... </strong>\nIt's National Tortilla Chip Day and we proclaim that there is no better place to celebrate this amazing holiday than in Houston.\nAccording to the official documentation behind the day at the <a href=\"http://www.nationaldaycalendar.com/national-tortilla-chip-day-february-24/\" target=\"_blank\">National Day Calendar website</a> the salty, fried treats were first mass-produced in Los Angeles sometime in the 1940s.\n<div class=\"hdnce-e hdnce-item-47758\"> <div

box</a></strong>\nThey were born as a way to make use of misfit tortillas that before this were likely thrown away.\nThey also make a great salsa, queso, and guacamole delivery system, if you're not up for just using a a spoon.\n<strong>DIPPING IN: <a href=\"/entertainment/restaurants-bars/article/The-Salsa-Project-Where-to-get-sauced-in-Houston-7390960.php\" target=\"_blank\">Where to get sauced in Houston</a></strong>\nThese days most of them are made out of corn tortillas, but the best and most decadent ones come from flour tortillas. Pair those with gooey queso and you are on the way to paradise.\nThere is a reason that chips and salsa was made the official state snack of Texas, the extra thousands of calories be damned.\n<strong>MAKE IF OFFICIAL: <a href=\"/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Texas-taco-expert-makes-the-case-for-tacos-as-the-10921450.php\" target=\"_blank\">Texas taco expert makes the case for tacos as the official dish of Texas</a></strong>\nHere in Houston you cannot escape tortilla chips and that is what we would like to call a good problem to have.\n<div class=\"asset_media asset-media\"> <div data-player-id=\"1479f628-8230-4c11-b9b8-cd1d71ce804d\" class=\"hearstPlayer\" data-player-host=\"player.hearst.io\"></div> <div class=\"caption\"> Pizza? Nachos? At the SAME TIME? Super Bowl Party: Upgraded. Today, we're showing you how to make Pizza Nachos! What You'll Need- CREAM SAUCE: 1-½ Tablespoon Unsalted Butter ½ Tablespoons Olive Oil 2 cloves Garlic, Minced finely 3/4 cups Heavy Cream 1 pinch Salt ¼ cups Parmesan Cheese, Grated - 4 cups Your Favorite Crispy Tortilla Chips 2/3 cups marinara sauce (or pizza sauce) handful of fresh basil, torn handful of parsley, chopped 1 cup Mozzarella Cheese, Shredded 1 cup Cheddar Cheese, Shredded Pepperoni and/or sausage (cooked) Steps: Place tortilla chips in a baking pan Mix and heat cream sauce ingredients, then drizzle onto chips Top with your favorite toppings, cheese, and another layer of chips, then more toppings Bake at 400 degrees for 7 minutes\n<span class=\"credit\"> Media: Brandpoint </span> </div> </div>Houston has chips and salsa most everywhere, or at least something akin to it. Papadums and various chutneys really hit the spot at an Indian place.\nThere is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to Tex-Mex restaurants in Houston so you should have no problem finding somewhere to celebrate National Tortilla Chip Day. Just go back to the place you celebrated National Margarita Day at earlier this week. You left your debit card there anyway.\n</div>", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/25/56/46/5695926/4/920x920.jpg",
