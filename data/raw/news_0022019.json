Part of the problem at Liverpool is that, because the club creates so much interest all over the world, people still seem to think that they’re still one of the driving forces in Europe – which they’re not! \n\"I think that’s the biggest problem is where people within the club, and I include the players, perceive the club to be and where they actually are - because there’s a huge gap. \n\"This is what the manager is fighting now, to change the mentality not only in the team, but in the whole club. Everyone needs to work 100% harder to get Liverpool back to where they were. The reason the club still creates interest is because the guys in the 70s and 80s were unbeatable.
