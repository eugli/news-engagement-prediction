(Supplied: Harper Collins) \nEllen Kelly's life was punctuated with heartache, right from the moment she left poverty and sectarian violence in Ireland to make a life in Australia. \nShe would go on to outlive seven of her 12 children and spend three years in the Old Melbourne Gaol over an altercation with a policeman who had come in search of her sons. \nIn fact, she was still a prisoner in the very same gaol on the day Ned was hanged there. \nBut her name appeared in the press long before that day and a particular picture was already being painted. \nIn October 1871 the Benalla Ensign and Farmer's and Squatter's Journal covered a court case in which Mrs Kelly was trying to get the father of one of her children to pay a version of child support. \nThe man's argument was that he could not be certain he was the father, and the local readers were treated to descriptions of Mrs Kelly's supposed sex life and allegations that many men frequented her bed. \nIt would not be the last time the newspapers would speculate on what happened in her home. \nBy the late 1870s her sons were involved in horse stealing rackets and other violent activities and the press rounded on Mrs Kelly. \nThe Ovens and Murray Advertiser reported on October 12, 1878: \n\"There are several amongst them reared up in crime, who have for years past been making a dishonest livelihood by thieving. \n\"It is one of the strangest phases of our human nature that with some, crime is hereditary.\" \nMr Kieza said it was important to consider the local papers as a barometer of community sentiment towards the Kelly family at the time, and that while Ned Kelly may have been \"mythologised\" in recent decades, at the time he was mostly seen as a criminal who should be stopped.

(Reuters) \n\"You have to remember this was a frontier community with most people trying to make a go of it, not wanting to be stuck up down the road by some kid with a gun in his hand,\" he said. \n\"So I think a lot of the authorities at the time did lay the blame for what he was doing at [Ellen Kelly's] feet. \n\"She's sort of the mother of all crime gangs, isn't she, whether she really wanted to be or not.\" \nBy the end of October 1878 the Melbourne Argus newspaper declared Mrs Kelly a \"notoriously bad woman\". \nMr Kieza said it was hard to be certain how fair the characterisation was. \nOn the one hand there is evidence she did harbour her violent sons, but at the same time he believes Mrs Kelly would have had little control over Ned and his actions. \nOne thing is for sure, however, and that is the media view of Ned Kelly towards the end. \nAfter he was seriously injured then captured in a police shootout, he was taken to Melbourne gaol to be nursed so he could be formally executed later. \nIn response the Hamilton Spectator posed the question: \n\"Why is Kelly like bacon? Because he is being cured before he is hung!\" \nThe Singleton Argus and Upper Hunter General Advocate wrote: \n\"Had society been ridded of a horde of hyenas, wolves and tigers, thirsting for human blood, the joy would scarcely have been greater than that felt at the hunting down of this band of unmitigated ruffians and murderers.\" \nIn the years following Ned's execution, Ellen Kelly appeared to garner a level of sympathy and reprieve in the press, according to Mr Kieza.
