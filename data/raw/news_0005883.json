Trump traveled to the Delaware base for the ceremony.\nThe speed with which the military acknowledged the civilian deaths was in stark contrast to the investigations after most previous allegations of civilian casualties, which have often taken months, if not years.\nThe goal of the operation was to detain Yemeni tribal leaders allegedly collaborating with al-Qaeda in Yemen and to gather intelligence about the group. Instead, a massive firefight ensued that brought in U.S. aircraft to strike the fighters and rescue the military team.\nOne of the aircraft, an MV-22 Osprey from a U.S. naval ship offshore, lost power and hit the ground hard enough to disable it and wound two service members. The $70 million aircraft was then intentionally destroyed by a U.S. bomb to ensure that it did not fall into militant hands.\nThe Central Command statement said that “determined enemy” forces “included armed women firing from prepared fighting positions,” and U.S. special operators were fired on from houses and other buildings.\n“Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has a horrifying history of hiding women and children within militant operating areas and terrorist camps, and continuously shows a callous disregard for innocent lives,” Central Command spokesman John J. Thomas said in the statement. “That’s what makes cases like these so especially tragic.”\nThe statement also said that “the raid resulted in the seizure of materials and information that is yielding valuable intelligence to help partner nations deter and prevent future terror attacks in Yemen and across the world.” \nAlthough U.S. forces have conducted airstrikes against al-Qaeda in Yemen in recent years, the operation was the first U.S.-led ground raid in Yemen since 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:31:10.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
