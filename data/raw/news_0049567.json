TMZ reports Aaron was left \"bloody\" and transported to a nearby hospital. He has since spoken out against Saturday's events, claiming he meant no disrespect and that authorities are investigating the attack. Photos \nFormer Child Stars \n\"I didn't get beat up I got a hit and pushed when I wasn't looking and they ran out the club and I stood on the speakers waiting for them?\" the 29-year-old tweeted on Saturday, adding , \"Maybe he should've not been a fake security guard causing liability to the venue and antagonizing me and my fans mid show...\" \n\"This dude sized me up after I said he had to go and said bye Felipe like bye Felicia the male version.. Friday? He needed to go,\" Carter continued . \nAaron then defended himself against accusations of racism, tweeting , \"News flash my band consists of three amazing black funk musicians and an Italian guitar player from Italy Simone Stan Petey and p bass... They raised me and have been playing with me doing shows for 16 years.\" Chillen w my boys before I finally get to bed... hospitals suck. & so do bullies.
