SN breaks down what needs to happen for the programs to be on even footing. Jim Harbaugh, Wilton Speight (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:16 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 6:16 p.m. ET \nIt's safe to say Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh will take any measure necessary to win on the recruiting trail. We saw enough evidence leading up to National Signing Day. \nHarbaugh jumped into a swimming pool with four-star wide receiver Oliver Martin. It worked. \nMORE: Top 20 recruiting classes since 2000 \nHarbaugh capped his third recruiting class — his second full cycle on the trail — with another episode of \"Signing of the Stars\" in the Crisler Center. Michigan's next adventure is a field trip to Rome from April 22-30 . The Wolverines' class this year featured recruits from 14 different states and Canada, another product of Harbaugh's satellite camp tour. The approach is working, but there's still work to do. \nMichigan has a top five class across most recruiting websites, but the Wolverines haven't quite caught up to the Mega Lo Marts of Ohio State and Alabama. Mike Farrell, national director of recruiting at Rivals.com, sees the design in Harbaugh's plan: It's all about trying to catch those two programs — specifically the Buckeyes in the Big Ten. \n\"It's an attempt to do it,\" Farrell said. \"He can do it. It's not going to happen overnight. Harbaugh is definitely a big-time name. He's a big-time recruiter, but he's four years behind.\" \nHarbaugh is getting closer, though. Ohio State routed Michigan 42-13 in 2015 before taking a 30-27 double-overtime thriller in Columbus in 2016. The Buckeyes have won 14 of the last 16 on the field. \nMORE: SN's 2017 Big Ten preview \nThat's due in large part to the Buckeyes winning the recruiting war. Using 247Sports team recruiting rankings , Michigan hasn't had a better class than Ohio State since 2007. In the past 10 cycles, the Buckeyes have an 18-5 edge in five-star recruits and a 137-113 edge in four-star recruits. The Buckeyes on average rank almost 10 spots higher per year than the Wolverines over that 10-year stretch. \nPart of the reason for celebration in Ann Arbor is they landed two-five star recruits in Solomon and Donovan Peoples-Jones. Ohio State, however, loaded up with five five-star recruits in this year's class. That's the difference. Harbaugh needs a few more five-star home runs on the recruiting front. \n\"When you see Ohio State loading up on five-stars like this, and Michigan having a really good recruiting class and right behind them in the rankings but with less five-stars,\" Farrell said, \"that gap needs to be closed.\" \nMORE: SN's way-too-early 2017 Top 25 \nSince Meyer's arrival in 2012, that gap is 11-5 in five-star recruits and 94-78 in four-star recruits. In the last two cycles under Harbaugh, however, the Wolverines have a 32-31 edge in four-star recruits. The Buckeyes still have the edge in five-star recruits, 6-3. \nThat's the gap Harbaugh must attack in 2018. \n\"You can coach them up if you're a good coach,\" Farrell said. \"That's what Urban does and that's what Harbaugh does. Harbaugh has two five-stars in this class, and Urban has more. There's a gap that needs to be bridged there, but that gap can be made up with scheme and coaching.\" \nWe know Harbaugh can coach and has a pro-style scheme that's going to continue to attract NFL-level recruits. The Wolverines will probably have double-digit players drafted in the 2017 NFL Draft, an effective infomercial. The Buckeyes took advantage last year after 12 players, including stars such as Joey Bosa, Ezekiel Elliott, Eli Apple and Michael Thomas, were taken in the 2016 NFL Draft. \nThe Wolverines could use a class like that. In the meantime, expect the same measures from Harbaugh. It's clear what he's doing is working, and everybody sees it on social media. \nMichigan is getting closer. When — and how — will Harbaugh bridge that gap? We'll find out in 2018. \n\"I just think it's going to take a couple more years to be recruiting at that high level that Urban is recruiting at,\" Farrell said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:48:53.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
