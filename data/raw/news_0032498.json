Old aerial photos can help monitor glacier change, study shows February 9, 2017 \nOld aerial photographs of Arctic glaciers can be used to assess and measure changes to their surface over time, according to a new study. Researchers find seafloor valleys below West Antarctic glaciers January 18, 2017 \nGlaciologists have uncovered large valleys in the ocean floor beneath some of the massive glaciers flowing into the Amundsen Sea in West Antarctica. Carved by earlier advances of ice during colder periods, the troughs enable ... Most meltwater in Greenland fjords likely comes from icebergs, not glaciers November 21, 2016 \nIcebergs contribute more meltwater to Greenland's fjords than previously thought, losing up to half of their volume as they move through the narrow inlets, according to new research. Mountain glacier melt to contribute 12 centimeters to world sea-level increases by 2100 January 10, 2011 \nMelt off from small mountain glaciers and ice caps will contribute about 12 centimetres to world sea-level increases by 2100, according to UBC research published this week in Nature Geoscience. Alaska glaciers make large contributions to global sea level rise June 17, 2015 \nAlaska's melting glaciers are adding enough water to the Earth's oceans to cover the state of Alaska with a 1-foot thick layer of water every seven years, a new study shows. Recommended for you Canadian glaciers now major contributor to sea level change February 14, 2017 \nIce loss from Canada's Arctic glaciers has transformed them into a major contributor to sea level change, new research by University of California, Irvine glaciologists has found. Ancient jar handles offer record of Earth's magnetic field strength over time February 14, 2017 \n(Phys.org)—A team of researchers from Tel Aviv University, The Hebrew University and the University of California has used ancient jar handles to chart the strength of the Earth's magnetic field over a 600-year period. ... Last year's El Nino resulted in unprecedented erosion of the Pacific coastline: study February 14, 2017 \nLast winter's El Niño might have felt weak to residents of Southern California, but it was in fact one of the most powerful climate events of the past 145 years. Scientists investigate what breaks down permafrost carbon February 14, 2017 \nA Florida State University researcher is delving into the complexities of exactly how permafrost thawing in the Earth's most northern regions is cycling back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and further fueling climate ... Ventura fault could cause stronger shaking, new research finds February 14, 2017 \nA new study by a team of researchers, including one from the University of California, Riverside, found that the fault under Ventura, Calif., would likely cause stronger shaking during an earthquake and more damage than previously ... Humans affect Earth system more than natural forces February 13, 2017 \nHumans are causing the climate to change 170 times faster than natural forces, new research co-led by The Australian National University (ANU) has found.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:45:48.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
