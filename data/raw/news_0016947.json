I feel good about this whole thing,” Bondra said to Puck Daddy in December. “We did something good and definitely she deserves the invitation. I think she accepted the invitation, which is good. It’s good for her. You can see how much love for the game she has. I know she was emotionally excited about it and she texted me a couple of times after the Skype call and she couldn’t thank me enough for the Capitals or Etihad as well for making her dreams come true.”\n– – – – – – –\nJosh Cooper is an editor for Puck Daddy on Yahoo Sports.
