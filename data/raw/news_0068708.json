Parents may think people will be a lot less judgmental of a child's behaviour - and their parenting skills - if they know the child has a label.” \nThe poll of 810 teachers, commissioned by GL Assesment, found that 62 per cent said children with genuine need are being overlooked as teacher resources are diverted towards those whose parents have made a fuss. There may also be a sense of relief that comes with being able to ‘blame’ a diagnosed disorder Lorraine Petersen, a special needs expert \nA ccording to figures from the Department for Education, just under a million children in England have a special educational need, 11.6 per cent of the school population, which is down from 18.3 per cent six years ago. \nThe decline in England followed a report from Ofsted in 2010 that said as many as a quarter of all children identified with an SEN were misdiagnosed. \nToo many schools, the report said, were using low attainment and slow progress as their main indicators of SEN rather than more robust assessments. \nAt one school, all pupils in Year 11 were categorised as SEN because they were at risk of not achieving their expected GCSE grades. At another, those who had parents serving in Afghanistan were labelled as SEN. \nThe Ofsted report concluded that children needed better pastoral support and teaching rather than being labelled as special needs.
