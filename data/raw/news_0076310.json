It is a way to create a halo effect around the other models by reviving talk about the Nokia brand,\" said Thomas Husson, a mobile analyst at Forrester. \nIn addition to the new 3310, HMD presented three new smartphones, the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 which will sell for different prices. \nThe Nokia 6 was already available in China and will now go on sale globally. \n\"We think (Nokia) could take 5 percent of the global smartphone market by the end of 2019. But it needs to get big quick or it won't work,\" said CCS Insight's device specialist and chief of research, Ben Wood. \nNokia was the world's top mobile maker between 1998 and 2011 but was overtaken by South Korean rival Samsung after failing to respond to the rapid rise of smartphones. \nIts telephone brand remains widely recognised, especially in developing markets. \nNow a leading telecom equipment maker, Nokia sold its entire handset business to Microsoft Corp in 2014. \nLast year HMD bought Microsoft Mobile's handset business and the right to use the Nokia brand. \nUnder the agreement, Nokia will receive royalty payments from HMD for sales of every Nokia branded mobile phone or tablet.
