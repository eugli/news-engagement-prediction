Article continues below \nNot for the first time this season, Messi earned the three points for his side by calmly dispatching the spot kick into the top left corner (skip to 8:00 in the video below) but you'd never guess it judging on his celebration. \nThe Argentine's muted reaction surprised quite a few given just how late it was in the game.
