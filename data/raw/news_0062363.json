I think it doubled up as the ice bath, I opted to jump in before I got thrown in. \n“Ray Haughan (team admin manager) didn’t get that choice. He just got thrown in by the lads.” \nStewart roomed with Philippe Coutinho during the four-night warm weather training camp and believes taking the players away was a shrewd move by Klopp. \n“It was really good. I really enjoyed it,” he said. \n“It was different to a normal trip away. We definitely got closer as a team. \n“We did a lot of team building stuff and just spending time together was really good. There was a lot of fun and games but I think there was a decent balance with hard work too.
