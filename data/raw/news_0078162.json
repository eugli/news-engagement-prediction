Whether it's a big display, strong security, or just something that fits into your budget, there's a great smartphone for you. Here are our top picks for 2017. \n[For more information on how we test mobile devices, visit our testing methodology page .] Best Smartphones for Business 5.1-inches, 2560 x 1440 pixels Ports micro USB, microSD, 3.5mm headphone Battery Life 5.6 x 2.7 x 0.3 inches Weight 5.5 inches, 1920 x 1080 pixels Ports 6.2 x 3.0 x 0.3 inches Weight 5.5 inches, 2560 x 1440 pixels Ports 5.66 x 2.74 x 0.33 inches Weight 5.5 inches, 1920 x 1080 pixels Ports 6.1 x 3 x 0.3 inches Weight 5.5 inches, 1920 x 1080 pixels Ports micro USB, microSD, 3.5mm headphone Battery Life 5.96 x 3 x 0.32 inches Weight \n\n\nSamsung's Galaxy S7 is an easy pick for our best business phone. It's one of the fastest smartphones on the market, with a roomy 5.5-inch display and a premium glass-and-metal design. But what makes it such a great business phone are productivity-boosting features like split-screen multitasking, which lets you view two apps at once. Then there's the improved fingerprint scanner, which provides a good security boost during daily use, and Samsung's Knox security suite, which separates work and personal apps to keep business data private. Finally, the curved Edge Display gives you quick access to frequently-used apps and contacts. \nTop features: Split-screen multitasking Edge Display shortcuts \nClick here to read a full review of the Galaxy S7 Edge from our sister site, Tom’s Guide. Best iPhone for Business \niPhone 7 Plus \nThe iPhone 7 Plus is the best iPhone you can buy. The 5.5-inch smartphone is just a well-rounded work phone, offering blazing fast performance, more than 10 hours of battery life, and Apple’s excellent Touch ID fingerprint reader for added security. But what really separates the iPhone 7 Plus from other phones on this list is the fact that it runs on iOS 10, which includes an improved version of virtual assistant app Siri, and adds new ways to link your iPhone to your MacBook Computer. \nTop features: Best Android Phone for Business \nGoogle Pixel XL \n\n\nIf you’re looking for a great business phone that offers a pure Android experience, Google’s Pixel XL can’t be beat. The sleek phone provides speedy performance and more than 11 hours of battery life, plus a roomy 5.5-inch display that gives you tons of room to work. And along with the standard Google Pixel, the Pixel XL receives software updates much sooner than other Android smartphones. That gives you access to handy features like the new Google Assistant app, which can help you schedule reminders, book appointments and meetings, perform quick Web searches and more. \nTop features: Fingerprint reader Timely updates \nClick here to read a full review of the Google Pixel XL from our sister site, Tom’s Guide. Best Battery Life Business Phone \nMoto Z Play Droid \n\n\nDespite its name, the Moto Z Play Droid is as good for work as it is for play. That’s because no smartphone lasts longer on a charge than this one, which ran for an epic 13 hours and 46 minutes on our battery test. For that reason alone, it’s a great pick for road warriors who want a business phone that lasts through a long business flight or two. The phone also sports a bright 5.5-inch display, a fingerprint reader for extra security, and a unique expansion port on the back that lets you attach special add-ons called “modules.” Those include a projector so you can beam presentations onto a wall, and a battery pack to increase the phone’s already impressive longevity by an extra 7 hours. \nTop features: Fingerprint reader Module expansions \nClick here to read a full review of the Moto Z Play Droid from our sister site, Tom’s Guide.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:57:33.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
