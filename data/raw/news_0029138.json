A judge in Pakistan has ruled on Valentine's Day, and he wants to bid it adieu. \nA court in the country’s capital Islamabad has put a ban on celebrating the Christian holiday Monday, telling a media regulator that there should be a city-wide blackout on all V-Day promotions. \nPakistan trails the U.S. and Europe in observing the holiday celebrating the life of the third-century Roman Saint Valentine, which built off the pagan fertility holiday of Lupercalia. \nBut some in the country have begun using it to advertise its products, leading conservatives to label Valentine's Day as a Western interloper that is not compatible with traditional Pakistani values. \nWhile some lovelorn Americans angry at their single status may think that February 14 celebrations are a scam thought up by florists and greeting card companies, court petitioner Abdul Waheed had said that it violated Islamic teachings.
