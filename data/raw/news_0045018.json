This list will highlight the 25 best drivers in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series each week of the season. \nOur first list takes into account the end of the 2016 season, any offseason changes, and how the driver has looked so far in the opening of Speedweeks. \nCheck out how we rank the top 25 drivers in the Monster Energy Cup Series heading into the Daytona 500: Mark J. Rebilas Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports 1 Joey Logano \nAfter winning the Advance Auto Parts Clash, Logano seemed to pick up where he left off in 2016. He has some more Ford teammates around him with the Stewart-Haas gang, which should be helpful for an already dominant restrictor-plate team. , LAT Images www.latphoto.co.uk Russell LaBounty 2 Kevin Harvick \nThe transition to Ford didn’t seem to hold Harvick back at all. He looked like he could put his car wherever he wanted in the Clash and qualified seventh on Sunday. Expect big things from the No. 4 team this season. , LAT Images www.latimages.co.uk Nigel Kinrade 3 Jimmie Johnson \nThe seven-time and defending champion had some issues keeping his car straight in the Clash, an issue Hendrick experienced at Daytona last year. Johnson qualified 13 th , the worst of the Hendrick gang that put two cars on the front row. Jasen Vinlove Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports 4 Denny Hamlin \nThe defending Daytona 500 champion looked strong from start to finish at the Clash and sold out to block Keselowski at the end. He qualified sixth and should be near the front all day at the 500. Jasen Vinlove Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports 5 Brad Keselowski \nKeselowski made a great move in an effort to win the Clash but got blocked down by Hamlin, opening the door for Logano to win the race. Brad has a knack for restrictor-plate racing and should be a threat to win his first 500. Jasen Vinlove Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports 6 Kyle Busch \nA perennial contender, the younger Busch brother should be capable of contending for the win with his JGR teammates this weekend. Daytona hasn’t been the best track for Busch in his career, though. © Matthew T. Thacker/LAT Photo USA Matthew T. Thacker 7 Chase Elliott \nThe second-generation driver grabbed the pole for the second year in a row and will look for a better result in 2017. I don’t see a sophomore slump holding Elliott back in Year 2. Getty Images Sean Gardner 8 Martin Truex Jr. \nAs long as Truex can pass pre-inspection in time, he’ll be a threat throughout the season. Expect the No. 78 Toyota to prove their success in 2016 wasn’t a fluke by any means. , LAT Images www.latphoto.co.uk Michael L. Levitt 9 Matt Kenseth \nThe oldest full-time driver in NASCAR shouldn’t have any issues continuing his streak of consistency through the 2017 season. Expect Kenseth to be a solid contender as he chases his third Daytona 500 win. Jasen Vinlove Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports 10 Clint Bowyer \nIt’s a new lease on life for Bowyer in 2017. He’s in championship-caliber equipment and has a hell of a desire to get the most out of it. His Daytona 500 qualifying showed he’s ready for the season. Jasen Vinlove Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports 11 Kyle Larson \nLarson showed decent speed in the Advance Auto Parts Clash but got caught in an accident that set him back. He qualified 16 th for the 500. The expectations are high for Larson as he enters his fourth Cup Series season. Getty Images Getty Images 12 Dale Earnhardt Jr. \nAfter a long absence due to concussions, Dale Jr. came back with a strong statement in Daytona 500 qualifying. He grabbed a front row spot with his Hendrick Motorsports teammate Chase Elliott. Getty Images Getty Images 13 Daniel Suarez \nThe rookie driver brings a lot of promise to a championship-caliber team as he replaces Carl Edwards in the No. 19 JGR Toyota. Expect him to have some bumps but we should see more good than bad in 2017. , LAT Images www.latimages.co.uk Nigel Kinrade 14 Kasey Kahne \nIt’s a make or break season for Kasey Kahne in 2017. He’s underperformed the past couple years but closed out 2016 with strong performances. The No. 5 looks to have comparable speed to the rest of the Hendrick stable at Daytona. NASCAR NASCAR via Getty Images 15 Kurt Busch \nIt wasn’t the start to 2017 Kurt Busch hoped for. He only lasted 18 laps in the Clash before Jimmie Johnson got loose and took him out. Then, he qualified 22 nd and didn’t seem to have the speed he hoped for. Jasen Vinlove Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports 16 Austin Dillon \nWith a 26 th -place starting spot, an a 12 th -place finish in the Clash, it hasn’t been the strongest start to 2017 for the elder-Dillon boy. He posted the best average finish at plate tracks in 2016, though. Getty Images Getty Images 17 Ricky Stenhouse Jr. \nThe Roush Fenway Racing cars showed some speed early in the first Daytona 500 practice session on Saturday and Stenhouse put his Ford Fusion in the 13 th spot in qualifying. This is a big year for Stenhouse to make a leap forward with a win and a playoff appearance. NASCAR via Getty Images Sarah Crabill 18 Ryan Newman \nAfter barely missing the playoffs in 2016, Newman enters 2017 with some pressure to get back among the top contenders. He started off with a solid showing in qualifying, putting his car 9 th on the grid. Jasen Vinlove Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports 19 Ryan Blaney \nThe alliance between Team Penske and Wood Brothers Racing should be stronger in 2017 and be a boost to Blaney in his sophomore season. The young driver showed a lot of speed in practice but posted a nearly identical drop off as Logano did in qualifying. © Russell LaBounty/LAT Photo USA Russell LaBounty 20 Jamie McMurray \nMcMurray has made the playoffs the past two years but exited early both times. While the driver of the No. 1 Chip Ganassi Chevrolet has shined big races, he hasn’t been consistent enough for a higher spot on the list to start the season. Jasen Vinlove Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports 21 Erik Jones \nThe rookie has a lot of new pieces around him at Furniture Row Racing in the No. 77 Toyota. It’ll be interesting to see how this team gels in 2017. The picture will be painted more clearly throughout the season. Furniture Row Racing 22 Trevor Bayne \nThis is a big year for Roush Fenway Racing as the team downsizes to two cars for 2017. Bayne miraculously won the 2011 Daytona 500 with Wood Brothers Racing. A strong finish would be a perfect start for the No. 6 team in 2017. He qualified 19 th on Sunday. NASCAR via Getty Images Brian Lawdermilk 23 Danica Patrick \nIt was an up-and-down weekend for Danica Patrick. She posted her career-best finish of 4 th in the Advance Auto Parts Clash by navigating crashing cars in the final turns. Let’s see what 2017 holds for her. Getty Images Getty Images 24 Ty Dillon \nThe only reason the younger Dillon brother makes this list is because of his qualifying performance at Daytona. If the Germain Racing No. 13 Chevrolet can show speed like that throughout the season, they’ll be in a much better position than most expected when Ty took over for Casey Mears. Mark J. Rebilas Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports 25 Paul Menard \nMenard edges out a grouping of mid-pack drivers like Aric Almirola and AJ Allmendinger for the final spot in our initial power rankings. There will likely be quite a bit of fluctuation with the bottom of the list as the season gets rolling. Richard Childress Racing has high hopes for 2017, we’ll see what Menard can accomplish in the No. 27 Chevrolet.
