(Submitted by Heather Fraser)\nOn Saturday the mercury rose to 11 C, breaking the previous record of 8.9 C set in 1915. On Sunday the high reached 10.2 C, which beat the record from 1916 of 7.2 C.\n\"It's not like you're just beating these records by a few tenths of a degree,\" Allen said. You're beating them by two or three degrees and these records have stood for over 100 years.\n\"That is almost disturbingly warm for this time of the year.\"\nWarm temperatures break records in Maritimes Riders Cup in Bathurst cancelled after mild weather destroys track Camp expected to open by March Break Fraser said just 40 centimetres of snow covered the ground at the sugar camp on Monday, and it is melting quickly.\nShe expects the municipally run sugar camp in Turtle Creek, which offers free tours to the public, will be open by March 6, the start of March Break.\nLast year was the first time Fraser could remember the camp opening early enough for March Break, and the maple syrup went fast.\n\"As quick as we could make it on the counter it was sold ... but people were looking for something to do. The snow was going, the skiing wasn't the best, so they were looking for something to do with their families.\nAllen, who called the record-setting temperatures over the past few days, \"truly impressive,\" said localized flooding is expected to continue with temperatures remaining above seasonal in most areas for the next few days.\n\nWith files from Information Morning Saint John", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:07:52.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
