We look forward to welcoming President Trump once dates and arrangements are finalised.”\n(Stefan Rousseau/PA) More The message went on to explain that the Government “recognises the strong views expressed” by many of those who signed the petition, which currently stands at 1,855,556 signatures.\nA date has not yet been set for the visit, but the statement, issued by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, says it “reflects the importance of the relationship between the United States of America and the United Kingdom”.\nDespite the decision from the Government, the issue will still be debated in Parliament on February 20. With many MPs against the invitation, it’s sure to be an interesting session.\nSome who received the email this morning took to Twitter to vent their frustration at the response.\nGot a valentine from the Government:\n\"We believe President Trump should be extended the full courtesy of a State Visit. Petition ignored\"\nX\n— Colin Moody (@MoodyColin) February 14, 2017\nGovt response to the 1.7 million people who signed petition to stop state visit of trump is pathetic.
