It would be the biggest upset. It would be spoken about for many, many, many years to come.\nDeacon in youth team action for the Gunners (Photo: EMPICS Sport) Now he's looking to fire Sutton past the Premier League side (Photo: PA) Read More FA Cup quarter-final draw in full with Chelsea set to host Manchester United “I don’t actually really remember too many upsets. But i would love my name and my team mates’ names to be written in the history books of beating Arsenal and all their world class players.\n“Us being underdogs and people not really giving us a chance, it would be an incredible achievement.\n“We believe we can do it, 100 per cent. Leeds brought a young team but there was still a few players who play in the Championship so beating them gives us great confidence that we can beat Arsenal.\n“We’ve got belief in this group. The way we play together at home, the team spirit and we believe we can beat anyone at home. We’ll treat Arsenal like we have every FA Cup which is believing in ourselves, showing we are a great team and we’ve proved that by getting so far.\nRoarie Deacon celebrates Sutton's first goal against AFC Wimbledon (Photo: Getty Images Europe) “You can’t get this far in the cup just by luck. We’ve shown that we can come back from 1-0 down, we’ve shown we can keep clean sheets, not be disheartened even when we draw and then go away and win.\n“We’ve got a lot more to show, in the Arsenal game especially. I hope that we can go out there and show what we can do.\n“I hope Arsenal will bring their big players - just not Sanchez! You want to play with Ozil and Sanchez but we also know how good they are. I think they’ll probably play a team similar to what they played at Southampton.\n“No matter what team they put out, it will be full of internationals and we can’t worry about that. If we play our game, play at our best then we can win.”\nTeam spirit has the National League side flying (Photo: 2016 Getty Images) Gander Green Lane is getting ready for the big day (Photo: WENN.com) Deacon scored a wonder goal to get Sutton level in their third round replay with Wimbledon and, despite struggling in the National League, they have got Arsenal firmly in their sights.\nIt is no wonder either as Deacon is one of FOUR ex-Arsenal players at the club with Craig Eastmond, Jeffrey Monakana and now Jack Jebb even though he is ineligible for the tie.\nDeacon still puts Arsenal assistant boss Steve Bould as one of his biggest influences and holds Arsene Wenger in the highest regard despite the fact he did not make it at the Premier League club.\nDeacon will lead the line for the non-league side (Photo: REUTERS) Read More Arsenal train ahead of Sutton clash without Mesut Ozil “Steve Bould was great for me, he turned me into a man really. I signed scholarship at 16, he was my coach with the under-18s and really moaned at me, drove it into me that football is not just all pretty, there’s a dirty side, you have to put your foot in, work hard,” said Deacon.\n“He always had an arm round the shoulder, I’ll always be grateful to Steve Bould, he filled the gap between 16 and becoming a man really.\n“I trained with the first team a bit, just on the training ground, I just saw Arsene Wenger around the place, I didn’t ever go into his office, but he says hello to everyone and is such a nice guy.\nDeacon holds Wenger in the highest regard (Photo: Stuart MacFarlane / Arsenal FC) “He gives young players a chance. He’s always playing youth team players, putting them on the bench in the League Cup, they’ve often got a player in the starting XI who has come through the ranks.\n“He is a manager who you can say definitely gives youth a chance. But the margins are so small. It takes only one injury to get a youth team or reserve team player to go over and train with the first team, catch the manager’s eye and improve by working with world class players.”\nDeacon never got that chance before the “heartbreaking” tap on the shoulder came from former youth boss Liam Brady when he was 19.\nSouth Londoner Deacon, who also had spells at Sunderland and Stevenage, still believes he can make the step back into league football. His agent Liam Bowes has had plenty of interest through the cup run.\nBut Eastmond is also desperate to use the FA Cup as a platform to get his career back on track and Monday night is the perfect time to showcase his talent.\nCraig Eastmond is another ex-Arsenal star (Photo: Bryn Lennon) Roarie Deacon with our man John Cross (Photo: DAILY MIRROR) Arsenal will face Sutton’s unforgiving artificial 3G plastic pitch and Deacon is convinced the tie is ripe for an upset.\nDeacon added: “When the draw was made, our name got pulled out of the hat first, then Arsenal got pulled out. I was standing behind Craig, he just turned around and started screaming in my face.\n“I’m a Manchester United fan so I wanted Man United. But I’m not being picky! For Craig to be able to go back, play against his old team, we go way back and are big mates.\n“For him to play against his old team and the team he supports. I want to play the game more for him than for myself. He played first team for Arsenal and it’s more meaning for him than me.\n“The pitch is a passing pitch. We like to get the ball down and pass, Arsenal like to get it down and pass. I think the pitch is spoken about too much by managers and teams who have to play us.\n“Teams like Arsenal and Leeds probably have 3G pitches at their training ground for when their pitches are frozen to waterlogged. I know Arsenal have a 4G at the training ground, a pitch is a pitch, we like to pass and I don’t think it’s that big a deal.”\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in Arsene Wenger speaks ahead of Sutton FA Cup clash Share this video Watch Next poll loading Will Sutton United beat Arsenal? 500+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Arsenal FC Newsletter Follow @mirrorfootball Subscribe to our Arsenal FC Arsene Wenger Premier League FA Cup Arsenal FC Sutton United FC", "external_links": ["http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1481/4221396001_5326742612001_IVRC1487324692181I-thumb480x360.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=mirrorfootball", "https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball"], "published": "2017-02-20T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:43:34.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
