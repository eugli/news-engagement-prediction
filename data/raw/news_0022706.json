In the span of one year, Denver went from NFL champ to watching the playoffs on television, while New England re-established itself as the league’s No. 1 team. So long as the Patriots have Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, they aren’t going anywhere. How do the Broncos catch up?\nJhabvala: While most like to point the finger at the quarterbacks, the priority should be the offensive line. Because until that line is better, we’ll never know how good quarterbacks Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch can be. And until that line is better, no veteran will survive back there, especially not Tony Romo, who couldn’t stay healthy behind the NFL’s best offensive line. According to Pro Football Focus , the Falcons owned the sixth-best line and the Patriots the 10th. The Broncos ranked 24th. Until they improve up front, the running game and the passing game will lag — and their quarterback will take a beating.\nRelated Articles February 6, 2017 Broncos have sixth-best odds of winning Super Bowl LII, per one sportsbook February 5, 2017 Broncos, others react to Patriots’ historic comeback Super Bowl victory February 4, 2017 Terrell Davis selected to Pro Football Hall of Fame Kiz: In his first year as an NFL head coach, there’s no way Vance Joseph can be expected to be on a par with Belichick. Unless the skills of Brady fall off a cliff on his 40th birthday, there’s no way Siemian or Lynch is going to be a match for one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. So the Broncos must think out of the box. Romo? I only mention his name because he gets you more agitated than your fifth cup of coffee of the day.\nJhabvala: Disagree. Too quick to decide the future and full potential of these quarterbacks. Romo is proven — 37 years old with a string of major injuries and one enormous contract. Siemian has 14 starts to his name and Lynch only two. Too soon to write them off. After all, didn’t John Elway finish his first season (10 starts) with twice as many interceptions (14) as touchdowns (seven) and a 54.9 passer rating? And didn’t Troy Aikman, another Hall of Famer with multiple rings, finish similarly with 18 interceptions, nine touchdowns and a 55.7 rating in 11 starts? This isn’t to say that Siemian or Lynch will turn into either, but give them a chance.\nKiz: While the offensive line needs work and Elway needs to draft a tight end to add scoring punch in the red zone, the only way the Broncos are going to overtake New England is if their defense is again the most dominant force in the NFL. So here’s hoping Elway saves his nickels to upgrade the D in free agency, and adds somebody such as Arizona’s Calais Campbell to dump Brady on his rump.\nJhabvala: With their offense as is, the only way the Broncos will stay alive is with a dominant defense. We saw that last season. Denver owned the league’s best pass defense for the second year in a row, but where that group could lead them to a Super Bowl victory in 2015, it couldn’t do enough in 2016. It even held Brady, the G.O.A.T., to 188 passing yards and no touchdowns in December, but the offense couldn’t do much of anything to get the victory. The offense has to be more proficient, but I would rather see Elway splurge on defense and nab Campbell than spend big on offense. Bolster the defensive line, fix the offensive line, as much as you can in a single offseason, tweak the scheme and let the two quarterbacks see what they can do.\nTake Our Poll", "external_links": ["http://polldaddy.com/poll/9659064", "https://www.profootballfocus.com/pro-ranking-all-32-nfl-offensive-lines-this-season/"], "published": "2017-02-08T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:12:28.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
