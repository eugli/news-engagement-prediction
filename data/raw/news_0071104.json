Top climate experts give their advice to Donald Trump Read more \nInglis was surprisingly upbeat about the prospect of Trump taking action on climate change. He claimed Trump was “channeling the fears of a fearful people” when he dismissed climate change as a “Chinese hoax” but could not possibly believe that. \n“There is some chance that President Trump, may respond to his daughter Ivanka’s interest in climate change. \n“There is a chance he may listen to secretary of state Rex Tillerson who, as recently as October was advocating for the same revenue neutral carbon tax we are proposing at [eco-right website] republicEN.org .” \nHe predicted reality would force Trump to shift, as gas prices increase, coal mining jobs do not return and new technologies will be needed to create jobs. \nInglis favoured a “revenue-neutral, border-adjustable carbon tax”, a plan in which Americans would be compensated for a carbon price with payroll and company tax cuts and the US would levy an import tax on countries without a carbon price. \nChanneling what he called “Trumpocene” rhetoric, Inglis said the new president could boast of “the art of the deal” and beating China in the World Trade Organisation court if the US “taxed their plastic coming into our Walmarts at the border”. \n“We don’t need an international agreement ... The way I’d put it is America can make a bold commercial move and the rest of the world will follow because China wants access to the American market,” he said, predicting the whole world would follow suit. \nInglis warned that such a move posed a policy risk to Australia, because coal would be in a “very difficult economic position”. \nHe said that technology also posed a risk to fossil fuel industries because improvements in solar power efficiency, battery storage and wind becoming more manageable in the grid would all make renewables a better investment . \nInglis said that allowing the free market to operate by removing subsidies on all types of energy and reflecting environmental damage through a carbon price would promote technologies that mitigate climate change. \nMeasures like removing tax credits for renewables would win Tea Party support but wind and solar would still be able to compete if the biggest subsidy – “being able to belch and burn into the trash dump of the sky” – is removed. Climate change a Chinese hoax? Beijing gives Donald Trump a lesson in history Read more \nInglis recounted how his son had convinced him to take environmental issues seriously and predicted that the Republican Party would be forced by demographics to adopt a climate policy that was less hostile to the science of global warming. \n“Young people want us to be relevant to their future and they want to know why [we have to] be so retro in the Grumpy Old Party rejecting science,” he said, predicting Republicans would prefer to cast themselves as the “Great Opportunity Party”. \nThe “eco-right’” asks “can free enterprise solve climate change”, he said, rather than framing the issue by asking whether people believe in climate change or not. \nBut faith is also a tool of persuasion because “there is a deep and rich opportunity there to talk about loving God and loving people and the stewardship of the earth”, he said. \nInglis said that in the field of climate change there is no contradiction between religious faith and science and people trust scientists all the time, such as doctors warning them about their cholesterol. \nInglis said parliamentarians had to risk their seats over issues like the environment or end their careers in the pitiable position of being able to say only: “I stood for nothing, I accomplished nothing, I just went along with the flow”.
