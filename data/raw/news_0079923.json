Ron Rivera (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:50 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:50 a.m. ET \nPanthers coach Ron Rivera is the only Hispanic head coach in the NFL, so he feels a responsibility to respond to the litany of comments made by president Donald Trump about Mexicans. \n\"I think people have to understand that whatever the president is trying to do, whatever he's trying to get across, it's really is not about what he's saying, but it's about how we react and how we do things,\" Rivera told CNN Money. \"There's a group of people that are trying to make better lives for their families, and that's what it really should be about. And I think what everybody has to understand, more than anything else, is that's what America's foundation is built on. And we can't lock people out because of that.\" \nTrump made the idea of building a wall to keep people from Mexico out of the U.S. a key point during his campaign. He has also been critical of the people coming across the border, saying, \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\" \nAs for Rivera, he said he hasn't faced any discrimination from people within the NFL. But he knows other people of his heritage do deal with a lot, and he understands people might look up to him as someone who has found success.
