I know I speak on behalf of the rest of the boys when I say we can’t believe we’re still winning these. Thank you very very much.” \nFans took to Twitter to express hope that Liam’s comments about 1D always being a band meant there was still hope their temporary hiatus may not become permanent.

Payno love ya bro.\" \nLouis Tomlinson added: “I’m watching the BRITS back home in Doncaster. Absolutely incredible. I’ve said it so many times but you guys continue to surprise us with how incredible you are over and over again. This means a hell of a lot to all of us. You are incredible, thank you so much.” \nOne Direction have been on hiatus since 2015.
