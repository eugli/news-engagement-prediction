We saw them on the runways for both the spring and fall 2017 seasons. We've seen celebrities from Kanye (obviously) to Jude Law (not as obvious) swear by a looser cut of pant. And now, they're starting to pop up on store racks. There are a lot of different ways to experiment with a freer silhouette in your wardrobe, from wind pants to carrot-shaped chinos , but one iteration we especially like is the relaxed work trouser, complete with an elasticated drawstring waist. For one, these supremely chill pants are so comfortable, they almost enter sweatpants territory. For another, they're damn flattering; especially on not-rail-thin dudes. What keeps them from looking too relaxed is a cropped, tapered ankle and fabrics and colors that rival all of your business casual go-tos. Like wool, cotton, and mohair in those staple shades of charcoal, navy, and olive. \nWhile you probably shouldn't treat them exactly like suit pants right out of the gate (shirt, tie, jacket, the whole nine yards), they'll look great with all of your other professional basics including cashmere sweaters, knit polos, or low-key button-down shirts and lace-up oxford shoes. On the weekend you can wear your new work trousers with a camp-collar shirt or ordinary T-shirt and sneakers for a completely different, equally modern effect.
