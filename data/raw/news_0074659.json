Budget cuts often target \"non-essential\" music programs. Several years ago, EVH donated 75 guitars from his personal collection to help continue the mission of the Mr. Holland's Opus organization. \nArecent study by the NAMM Foundation found that kids who play instruments get superior grades, have higher IQs and face reduced odds of turning to drugs and alcohol later in life. \nVan Halen's desire to continue music education stems from his personal experiences. \"It hit me when I graduated high school; you sign everybody's yearbook and everybody asks you, 'So what college are you going to?' Well, Eddie stuck to playing the guitar. But, he wants kids to have a chance to learn something more than just basic math, science, history, and literature. \nHere's Van Halen's appearance on CNN recently: Mike Steele - I love live music and watching hockey. Been a Steelers fan since birth! Lived in the South Hills a good part of my life. Mom & Dad have been married 50 years. I have two amazing sisters and I'm a proud uncle, too. This is my 2nd tenure at the studios - I did weekends at WDVE in the 1990's. After working in Austin, Texas for eight years, I returned to my hometown. Happy to be back in the Burgh!
