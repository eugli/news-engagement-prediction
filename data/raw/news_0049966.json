Metro Phoenix is one of the most affordable big areas for homebuyers, according to a new study.

New home communities with more affordable prices are now going up again on the Valley's fringes and drawing buyers. \nPittsburgh is the U.S.’s most affordable big housing market. There, a buyer only has to make about $32,000 to purchase a house. \nPhoenix ranks right below Atlanta and above Tampa for housing affordability. \nThe least affordable city is San Francisco, where a buyer must earn more than $160,000 to afford a house for $837,500. 7 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2m5eulz TOP VIDEOS ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:40:10.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
