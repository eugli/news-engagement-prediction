They (the Centre) have problem in giving its nod to the Bill also. Our MLAs do not indulge in corruption...while their (BJP) MLAs and MPs come on scooter initially (just after elections) and they have expensive houses, cars, five-star hotels and farm houses after five years,” Sisodia told reporters here. \nHe said that there are two models of politics in the country -- “honest” politics and that of “corruption”. \n“In politics, there are several ministers, MLAs, MPs whose income get increased by up to five times in just one year despite their low salaries,” he said. \nThe deputy chief minister said that in Delhi too, there are many councillors who had roamed on scooters just after municipal polls, but they have expensive cars, farmhouses after their five-year term. \nRead: Delhi MLAs working hard, deserve salary: parties \n“The second formula is that a person enters into politics and serve the people with honesty. In Delhi, an MLA gets just Rs 12,000 as salary. \n“We just want to increase the MLAs’ salaries which is being ridiculed, but the really joke is of the democracy that when an MP and MLA’s incomes get increased by two times despite the fact that they get low salaries,” he said. \nAs per the Bill, the basic salary of MLAs is proposed to be increased from current Rs 12,000 to Rs 50,000 and their overall monthly package to Rs 2.1 lakh as against existing Rs 88,000, which will make Delhi legislators the highest paid lawmakers in the country. \nThis was for the second time the home ministry has returned the Bill to the Delhi government. \nLast year, it had asked the Arvind Kejriwal government regarding the calculation which was performed to arrive at the figures mentioned in the Bill. \nIt was not clear what method has been used to calculate the salaries for MLA and the Speaker, official sources said. \nHowever, the Bill was re-sent by the Delhi government to the Home Ministry for consideration and approval. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:43:59.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
