The aim is to free up space on the network, boost frequency and improve reliability. \nIt also means Manchester Airport services will run all the way into the city centre, at first to Deansgate-Castlefield, then Victoria later this year.

Metrolink is now the biggest light rail system in the UK.

So what that means is that we have much more resilience in the system and we will be able to run things with a lot more surety and a lot more reliability.” \nThe first phase of the Second City Crossing opened from Victoria through to a new stop at Exchange Square in December 2015.

He said it had been a remarkable journey, and paid tribute to all those involved. \nSir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester City Council, said the route would make travel easier while taking in some of the city’s most iconic landmarks. \nHe added: “The new line highlights the journey of our city, how much the city has changed in such a short space of time, and represents a major milestone in Manchester’s continuing development and growth.” \nFrom Sunday 26 February, the following services will run: \n· Altrincham – Bury (via Market Street) \n· Altrincham – Etihad Campus", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:32:49.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
