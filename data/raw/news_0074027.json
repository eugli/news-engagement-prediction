Guus Hiddink (R) is greeted by Liverpool's German manager Jurgen Klopp. Source: AFP \nThe Foxes would reportedly want Hiddink, who led Australia to the 2006 World Cup Round of 16, to manage Leicester until the end of the season before they deciding their next mangerial move. \nThe Dutchman’s experience in the Champions League is reportedly also seen as important as Leicester have an important last-16 second leg against Sevilla at home to come. \nAccording to The Telegraph: “Although it is understood that, at present, Hiddink has indicated that he probably does not want the job he has not been entirely ruled out. Hiddink, a hugely experienced firefighter of a manager, was also in charge of Chelsea when they gained the draw that meant Leicester had won the league last May.” Claudio Ranieri.   \nThe report also states that Leicester have approached Portuguese coach Vitor Pereira , who is at 1860 Munich. \nHowever, Leicester’s star players have been asked if they want Nigel Pearson to return to the King Power, according to The Sun. \nPearson was axed after saving the club from relegation in the 2014-15 season, with Leicester citing “fundamental differences in perspective exist between us” as the reason. \nRoberto Mancini reportedly emerged as the first favourite for the Foxes head coach role, but according to Sky, he isn’t keen on the job. \nThe bookmakers next favourite is Alan Pardew , while Roy Hodgson, Frank de Boer ,and Aaron Mooy’s Huddersfield boss David Wagner are other potential candidates. \nAs it stands, caretaker manager Craig Shakespeare will manage the Foxes for their clash against Liverpool.
