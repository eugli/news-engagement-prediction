And it would allow expedited deportation for illegal immigrants who have been in the country for up to two years, instead of the current two weeks.\n  \"The surge of illegal immigration at the southern border has overwhelmed federal agencies and resources and has created a significant national security vulnerability to the United States,\" Kelly wrote in one of the memos, which are dated Friday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T15:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T21:10:28.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
