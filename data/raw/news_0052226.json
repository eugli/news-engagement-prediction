InStyle caught up with the Danskin ambassador and World of Dance host and asked her all about the show’s creator, Ms. Jennifer Lopez . \n“I met her at a dinner, actually the kick-off dinner for the show. I knew she had wanted me to do the show and I hadn’t spoken to her yet,” she said. \nVIDEO: Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan's Cutest Couple Moments \n“She’s the most grounded, down-to-earth, nicest person. She’s a total girl’s girl. I just really felt comfortable with her, knowing what vision she has for the show and that she’s also a dancer. We’re all dancers. We’re making a show from dancers for dancers, and that, to me, felt really authentic and right. It just felt good to do it.” \nWhich begs the question: Who is better on the dance floor? “Oh my goodness. I don’t even know! That’s so funny, I think we’re so different. We grew up dancing different styles. We just danced on a promo though and she is, I mean, she’s incredible. She’s such a good dancer. I was really impressed. She brings it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:57:38.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
