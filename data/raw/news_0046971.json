That’s really the job of the regulator, and the process that we engage in in adopting regulation is very, very important because it sends a message.\" Story Continued Below \nIn his previous job, Pruitt had sued to block Obama's EPA rules on climate change and the reach of the Clean Water Act — regulations that the White House is expected to gut with executive orders in the coming days. \nPruitt said the EPA would stop the \"abuses that occur sometimes: Guidance through rulemaking, or using the guidance process to do rulemaking, or engaging in litigation — regulation through litigation, consent decrees that actually bypass the Administrative Procedures Act.” \nPruitt also praised the founding fathers, who he said addressed the problems of their day but \"didn't shirk their responsibility.\" \nHe also used the meeting at EPA headquarters as a sign of how people can disagree and still be able to sit down and have a productive meeting. \n\"They acted with civility,\" he said. \"Civility is something I believe in very much.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:24:12.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
