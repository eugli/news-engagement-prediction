More by Julia Terruso Arrow icon \nTwo months into the city’s sweetened beverage tax, supermarkets and distributors are reporting a 30 to 50 percent drop in beverage sales and plans for layoffs. \nOne of the city's largest distributors says it will cut 20 percent of its workforce in March and an owner of six ShopRite stores in Philadelphia says he expects to shed 300 workers this spring. \n“People are seeing sales decline larger than anything they’ve seen up to this point in the city,” said Alex Baloga, director of government relations at the Pennsylvania Food Merchants Association. \nIn response, the city questioned the legitimacy of the early figures and predicted customers responding to the initial sticker shock by shopping outside the city would return. \n“We have no way of knowing if their sales figures and predicted job losses are anything more than fear-mongering to prevent this from happening in other cities,” said city spokesman Mike Dunn. \nThe 1.5-cent-per-ounce tax on sweetened and diet beverages is funding nearly 2,000 pre-K seats this year as well as several community schools. The city hopes it will bring in $92 million per year for the education programs and to in part fund renovated parks and recreation centers. \nThe city predicted a 27 percent sales decline as a result of the tax but early returns show higher losses, fueling a resurgence of the anti-soda tax coalition which fought vigorously against the tax this summer. \nBob Brockway, chief operating officer of Canada Dry Delaware Valley, which distributes about 20 percent of the city’s soft drinks, said sales are down 45 percent in Philadelphia. The company will lay off 20 percent of its workforce the first week in March. The distributor is a subsidiary of Honickman Affiliates, owned by Harold Honickman, who helped lead the opposition to the tax this summer . \nThe 35 jobs on the line include managers, salesmen and drivers, Brockway said. Sales are up about 20 percent in the suburbs but that hasn’t helped business break even. On the whole, the company’s sales are down about 30 percent, Brockway said. \n“We don’t anticipate people coming back,” Brockway said. \nThe tax, passed in June, went into effect Jan 1, and is levied on distributors, who have passed it onto retailers. \nJeff Brown, who manages six ShopRite stores in the city, said beverage sales were down 50 percent from January 1 to Feb. 17 compared to the same time period in 2016. More concerning, he said is a 15 percent dip in overall sales at city stores. \n“People didn’t change what they drink, they changed where they’re buying it,” Brown said. \nSince January, Brown has had to cut 6,000 employee hours. He suspects he’ll lose about 300 people, which amounts to one fifth of his total workforce voluntarily and through layoffs in coming months. \nTo keep customers, Brown has ordered more tea and lemonade powders, which are tax exempt. He’s stocking shelves with lower-quantity sugary drinks, which are easier to sell than the 2-liter bottles or 12-packs. \nDay’s Beverages, an independent soft drink distributor, has seen a steep decline in Philadelphia offset by a 50 percent boost in Camden, Wilmington and Bensalem, said owner David Day. \nDay also distributes to 18 other states but Philadelphia makes up 30 percent of his market. \nHis carry out business has ballooned since the tax, he said. \nDay is a registered distributor with the city and required to remit a monthly payment on on any taxed beverages that go on to be sold in Philadelphia. He sent payment in last week for deliveries he made throughout Philadelphia. But Day doesn’t tax people coming in to buy soda directly from his warehouse. \n“We’re one block out of Philadelphia, in Delaware County and you can’t imagine how many stores are coming to our warehouse and picking up our soda. I don’t care what they do - they're coming here as a cash and carry. Our doors are open to everyone,” he said. “We don’t police where it’s going.” \nThe tax, upheld in December, is under appeal in a case expected to start April 3 in Commonwealth court . In the meantime, a wave of discontent has swept the industry. \nAbout 50 salesmen, drivers and industry lobbyists flooded city council members before their weekly meeting Thursday. \nThe Food Merchant’s association, in conjunction with movie theaters, restaurants and supermarkets, is mounting a new ‘Ax the Bev Tax,” campaign this week. Participating businesses will hang up signs encouraging people to call their elected representatives. \nSome legislators in Harrisburg weighed in earlier this month, with an amicus brief calling on the court to overturn the tax . \nBut within City Hall, legislators are taking a wait-and-see approach. Some city council members have encouraged patience. \nDunn said the administration predicts shoppers will return. Distributors could see better sale numbers, too, since some stores stocked up on pre-taxed merchandise, he said. \n“...Initially people are upset and drive over the city line, but then they do the math and realize the cost of gas or the pure inconvenience doesn’t make it worth it,” Dunn said. \nTo hit its target, the city needs to collect $7.6 million a month in tax revenue. The first collection was due Feb 21, but collection information won’t be available until next month, Dunn said. \nJ. Del Conner is one of the 210 distributors registered with the city. He owns Dr. Physick soda, a tiny beverage maker that sells about 500 cases a year. The soda is named after Conner’s great, great, great grandfather, a Philadelphia pharmacist who introduced carbonated water to fruit syrup as a way to help relieve gastric disorders. \nConner usually sells about 10 cases a month in winter but didn’t send any money to the city this month. \n“So far in January and February we’ve had no sales,” he said. “Zero.” Published: February 21, 2017 — 5:25 PM EST | Updated: February 21, 2017 — 5:28 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.
