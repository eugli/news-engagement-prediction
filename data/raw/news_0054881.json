Image copyright Mike Scott Image caption Liam Dolan and Johnny Mac play Francie and Josie in a tribute show touring Scottish theatres \nThe new Rev IM Jolly act will be a new addition to a Francie and Josie tribute show, which has been performed at theatres across Scotland over the last two years. \nJohnny Mac, who plays Rikki Fulton's character in the show, said: \"We were chatting in rehearsals at the end of last year about where we could take the show to keep it fresh and new for the audience. \n\"I actually said it would be great to play the Rev IM Jolly and then we started looking into it. \n\"We spoke to Tony Roper who said that the Scottish SPCA had the rights to Rikki's work so we contacted them. \n\"After negotiations with them, they granted us permission to be able to do it. So we are absolutely over the moon. \n\"The scripts are fantastic so it's a pleasure to perform it as a comedian and as an actor.\" 'Rehearsing long days' \nThe last person to take on the role of The Rev IM Jolly was former first minister Alex Salmond. \nHe took on the role of the dour minister for a BBC Scotland Children in Need special . \nAsked if his performance would be better than that of Mr Salmond, Johnny Mac said: \"I'll give it my best shot. \n\"I'm trying my best, rehearsing long days and trying to get it right for the audience.\" \nHe will perform the new sketch for the first time at the Palace Theatre in Kilmarnock on Friday as part of Francie and Josie: The Return .
