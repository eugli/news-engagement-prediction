So my daughter actually raised the petition.\" 'We need America' \nBoth petitions passed the threshold of 100,000 signatures needed to be considered for a debate in Parliament. \nExplaining his reason for setting up the petition, Mr Brown added: \"We are very honoured [by] the fact that he is giving us this visit so early... and I think he should be very pleased that we have given him the honour of seeing our Queen. So it's both ways. \n\"We need America at the moment if we are going to proceed with Brexitâ€¦ I think that we don't want to go out of our way to alienate what could potentially be one of our best customers. \n\"Just because someone says something they don't like, should he be gagged? \n\"How can you have a discussion with somebody if you're not willing to enter into a discourse?\" 'Very difficult position' \nOn Tuesday, a former head of the Foreign Office said the prime minister's decision to invite Mr Trump on a state visit had put the Queen in a \"very difficult position\". \nLord Ricketts told the BBC the visit should be delayed until later in Mr Trump's presidency because of the controversy around some of his policies. \nInstead, Mr Trump should be invited for an official visit this year, \"centred mainly on political talks with the prime minister\", Lord Ricketts said. \nTheresa May's office said on Monday that she was \"very happy\" to extend the invitation to Mr Trump on behalf of the Queen.
