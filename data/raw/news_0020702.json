I'm honored to be even considered for this.\"\nEarlier this week, news broke that the White House was looking to give Spicer some extra help in the communications office. Spicer has been working double-time since Jan. 20, serving as both White House press secretary and communications director.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts   news desk and delivered to your inbox.\n  Washington Examiner News Alerts.   alert soon! Spicer was expected to keep his job as the press liaison and give up his gig as communications director , making Higbie's interview for press secretary even more surprising. Higbie previously worked as spokesman for the Great America PAC.\nNo one in the Trump administration has ever stated publicly that Spicer is underperforming in his job, but comments he has made from the podium have received more pushback from the media than other administrations' press secretaries.\nSpicer is a former colleague from the Republican National Committee to now-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. Priebus \"vouched for Spicer and against Trump's instincts,\" one source told CNN.\nAccordint to that report, Trump \"regrets it every day and blames Priebus\" for the place Spicer has put the Trump administration in as a result of his briefings, so it may make sense that the White House is considering a replacement.\nAlso   Haley: UN appointment of Palestinian leader 'unfairly biased' \"Going forward the United States will act, not just talk, in support of our allies,\" Nikki Haley said.\nBy Anna Giaritelli â€¢ 02/10/17 8:34 PM Top  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:29:57.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
