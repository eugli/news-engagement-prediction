Will the MACC be reined in before they could make any further arrests? Both Shahrir and the MACC have the support of the rakyat who are keen to see the culprits being punished for their involvement in the scandals. \nThis case, coupled with a number of other high-profile cases, have made us appear to be a nation of kleptocrats, as spelt out by the US Department of Justice in its civil suit to recover some US$1 billion suspected to be siphoned out of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) funds. \nMy suspicion is that Shahrir will be pressured to resign on his own accord or he will be sacked unceremoniously from the job as Felda’s newly-appointed chairperson. This is after he highlighted the missing billions in Sinar Harian , confirming the suspicion raised earlier by Pandan lawmaker Rafizi Ramli. \nHardly has the dust settled with Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak’s 1MDB scandal, now we are faced with the question where another RM4.3 billion of funds raised through the listing of Felda Global Ventures (FGV) have gone to! \nAccording to Shahrir, some RM200 million which had been reported missing by the Auditor-General’s Office is unrecoverable, as it had been expended in various unrelated programmes. \nThis amount of money could have been translated into hundreds of scholarships for deserving students, or could have gone to feed thousands of poor people for a few years. However, there is no point crying over spilt milk. \nIn my opinion, the MACC has to investigate further into these abuses. Questions have to be asked about the role of its former chairperson, Mohd Isa Abdul Samad. \nWhy were these abuses not detected at an early stage, assuming that everyone was sleeping on the job? What did Mohd Isa do to stop the abuses? Why did he not report the losses made? \nWhy did he not investigate into the billions that have gone missing during his tenure as chairperson of Felda Global Ventures Holdings Berhad (FGV)? Did he have a part to play in the Felda scandal? \nFor the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
