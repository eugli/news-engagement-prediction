Save Netflix \nWhile we were expecting Amazon to score an Oscar first for Manchester by the Sea , Netflix ended up beating out that film with a Best Documentary (Short Subject) Oscar for The White Helmets .Directed by Orlando von Einsiedel, the film centers on a group of volunteer rescue workers for the Syrian Civil Defense Force, also known as \"The White Helmets,\" who risk their lives to help civilians in that war-torn country. The group has saved more than 60,000 lives so far, and they've also been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. As you might have guessed, The White Helmets is available to watch on Netflix now.
