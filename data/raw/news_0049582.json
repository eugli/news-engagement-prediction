Winning in Australia is a huge achievement. This is Asela's first tour to Australia and we are happy.\"\nAustralia are fielding a depleted side with their full-strength Test squad currently in India. The third and final match of the series will be played on Wednesday in Adelaide.\n\"That was one hell of an innings,\" Australia captain Aaron Finch said. \"When you have a good player in good form, they hurt you.\n\"Sri Lanka played very well there. Take nothing away from them. The series is gone, but hopefully we can salvage something in Adelaide.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T15:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T14:17:46.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
