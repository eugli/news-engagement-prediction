I can live with either one.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story There was a time, Mr. Trump acknowledged, when he believed the two-state approach was the easiest way to resolve the Israel-Palestinian conflict. But, he continued, and his words trailed off as though he seemed to recognize he was about to wade into treacherous diplomatic waters. Mr. Trump was getting at something: There is no longer much hope for a two-state solution , given Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing government and the exhausted leadership of the Palestinian Authority. Rather than parse the president’s words for policy implications, some experts said, one could read them as a statement of his intent to be realistic and flexible. “In many ways, Trump was more forthcoming than anybody would have expected,” said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to Israel and Egypt. “He was basically saying, ‘I’m open to anything, as long as it gets me to peace.’ ” Nor did Mr. Trump try to discredit the two-state formula; he merely opened the door to other options. Once Palestinian officials get over their reflexive indignation, said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, they will focus on his enthusiasm for a deal rather than obsess over semantics. The trouble with that theory is that presidents, by definition, make policy whenever they speak. In the case of China, Mr. Trump may have thought he was simply defending his decision to take a congratulatory phone call from the president of Taiwan after the election. “I don’t know why we have to be bound by a ‘one China’ policy,” he told Fox News, “unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.” “We’re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation,” he continued, “with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don’t tax them; with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn’t be doing; and, frankly, with not helping us at all with North Korea.” For Mr. Trump, “one China” is one element in a complex, unsatisfying relationship. But for China’s leaders, who have viewed Taiwan as a breakaway province since the Communist revolution, it is the bedrock of their international legitimacy. They were not willing to return to business as usual until Mr. Trump recanted his comment. In its report of the call between the two leaders, the Chinese state news media characterized Mr. Trump almost as though he were a wayward student. The American president “stressed that he fully understood the great importance for the U.S. government to respect the One China policy” and that “the U.S. government adheres to the One China policy.” Thus ended a break with tradition that lasted barely two months. \nFollow The New York Times’s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .
