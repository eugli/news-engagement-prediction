If the new plan is approved, the pay for police recruits would jump to $37,000 while the pay for firefighters would increase to $34,000. \nDurham Police Chief C.J. Davis said lower pay in the city makes it tough to recruit new officers. \nThe city recently approved incentives, including a $5,000 hiring bonus and up to $3,000 for relocation fees, but those who support the idea of a pay raise said that’s not enough. \nRetired Interim Police Chief Larry Smith has also spoken out about the issue, saying a pay raise is long overdue, especially if the city wants to keep potential recruits from going elsewhere. \nThe meeting is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:57:27.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
