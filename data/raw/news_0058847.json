The Tigers are 7-19 overall and are set to miss the NCAA Tournament for the fourth straight year. When your team is going nowhere, it’s all about the small victories. Like chanting “Cal you suck” while John Calipari is interviewed before halftime. Mizzou fans have a point: Kentucky only leads the Tigers by one at halftime, which is borderline embarrassing. Maybe Kentucky will have a big second half and win easily. Maybe it won’t. The most important thing is these Mizzou fans got to ruin a Calipari interview, and that is worth the price of admission by itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:22:09.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
