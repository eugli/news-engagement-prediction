By Aarti Iyengar | Published: February 27, 2017 8:06 am comments \nThe 89th Academy Awards has started and some of the well deserved movies are winning big! Celebs like Dev Patel, Priyanka Chopra, Dwayne Johnson , Michelle Williams, Emma Stone, Meryl Streep, well basically most of Hollywood’s celebs were present for the big night. The event kickstarted with Justin Timberlake’s Can’t Stop The Feeling performance that actually made us groove as well! It was a very entertaining performance and even the audience couldn’t help but join in with the singer and dance along. Soon Jimmy Kimmel took centrestage and dissed Donald Trump in the funniest way by attributing his quote on Meryl Streep being an overrated actress! Oh yes, that was entertaining. So far the award function seems promising with the way the awards are being given to deserving projects and actors. The first award of the night was Best Supporting Actor category and Mahershala Ali bagged it for his performance in Moonlight. \nWe decided to bring to you all the hot updates from the event starting from Sunny Pawar’s adorable red carpet antiques to Priyanka’s fashion rendezvous. We’ve put out the list of winners which we’ll keep updating as and when the award has been announced. So far here are the winners!
