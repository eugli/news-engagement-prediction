That's a Grammy short of EGOT-ing. \n\"There’s one place that all the people with the greatest potential are gathered. One place. And that’s the graveyard,\" said a tearful Davis in her acceptance speech. \nPeople ask me all the time, 'What kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola?' And I say exhume those bodies. Exhume those stories. The stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition. People who fell in love and lost. I became an artist and thank God I did because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life. 'Fences' star Viola Davis, supporting actress Oscar winner \nDavis thanked \"Fences\" playwright and screenwriter August Wilson, who \"exhumed and exalted the ordinary people.\" She also thanked director and co-star Denzel Washington, who received a rousing round of applause when she addressed him with \"O, Captain! My Captain!\" \n\"Thank you for putting two entities in the driving seat: August and God. And they served you well.\" Latest updates", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:23:41.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
