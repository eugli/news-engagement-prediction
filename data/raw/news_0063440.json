Transgender people don’t look to cause trouble. Actually the opposite — they want to keep a low profile. They are just trying to be who they are inside and go about everyday as normal,” she says. Amy Newman/The Record via AP Individual schools will still be able to let transgender students use the bathrooms with which they are most comfortable, according to The New York Times , and Maldonado says Joe’s New Jersey elementary school is supportive of his gender identity. Furthermore, she says she would not be afraid to travel with him to less tolerant areas of the country and allow him to use the men’s room. “You don’t need a license to go to the bathroom, he would just go right in,” she says. “They wouldn’t know it. I wouldn’t need a birth certificate for him to use the bathroom. And if anyone questioned it I would just tell them to mind their own business and he is going to use that bathroom — that’s exactly what I would say.” “I would say ‘Does he look like he belongs in the girls bathroom? You’ve got to be kidding.’ It was the same thing with Cub Scouts, I was like, ‘Does he look like he should join the Girl Scouts?’ “ Courtesy Kristie Maldonado Maldonado says Joe began showing signs that he was transgender at 2, and she has to come to realize that being transgender isn’t a choice Joe made — it’s just who he is. “ For a long time I was up every night from midnight to 6, reading so many books and worrying. Then finally there was a turning point that I put my hands up and said, ‘It is what it is,’” she says. She educated herself on what it means to be transgender, and now she hopes she can help others understand that transgender people are no threat to anyone — in or out of the bathroom. “This is not a phase, this is how they feel day in and day out — everyday,” she says. “In the mirror they see themselves as their identity: It’s between the ears not what’s between the legs. “Also, most of the time you won’t even know you’re going to a bathroom with a transgender person — people are not peeping under the stalls,” she says. “I think this is all about people just being uneducated, thinking they are in danger. They think it’s about sexual orientation, but it’s not, it’s about gender identity.” RELATED VIDEO: Devina Keswani: Youngest Sibling, First Grader and Transgender Princess Although Joe is still young enough for his parents to watch over him closely, Maldonado says she does fear for the future when they are not able to be there to protect him. “I don’t like to think about that too much because when I think about that I can’t sleep,” she says. “I was literally getting myself sick thinking about it — just thinking about issues before anything happened — so I said, ‘Let me enjoy the moment and enjoy life now and when the time comes, then worry.’“", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:42:52.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
