(Photo: onetribefestival.org) \nAmong the acts so far confirmed for the musically varied bill so far are Move D, Psychemagik, The Turbans, Mobius Loop, Lone, Calibre, Henge, Wild Marmalade, Sonic Species, Radioactive Man, DJ Bone, Boddika, Afriquio, and the 'The Originator of Detroit techno' Juan Atkins (pictured above). \nDJ Hype - pictured below - has also designed a three hour set plotting the history of drum n bass. (Photo: onetribefestival.org) \nThe site will feature a large family friendly entertainment and camping area packed with games, swings, interactive activities, and arts and crafts - as well as yoga and trance dancing. \nThe event, which is not-for-profit and run by volunteers, takes over the estate from August 3-8, with all profits going to animal welfare charity The Green Paw Project.

Cholmondeley Castle Estate in Malpas (Photo: onetribefestival.org) \nThe Green Paw Project was set up by One Tribe Festival's founder Stephen Chesters with Dutch vet Jochem Lastdrager to help stray and injured animals and support community education programmes, and is currently raising £50,000 to build an animal welfare conservation lodge in Malawi. \nCo-organiser Sophie Bee says the key aim of the festival is to help us understand the power of partying together. \"If you return to the idea of tribalism, it's a celebration of the land, of the time of the year. \n\"We really do believe in the feeling you get when you're all together as one tribe. It's so strange, there's nothing like that. We don't have commercial backing, we don't take sponsorship, and this is a festival for everyone of all ages.\" Read More \nStephen, who has been running rave and party events for around 15 years in the north west and North Wales, says One Tribe should re-establish the true meaning of the festival. (Photo: onetribefestival.org) \nHe adds: \"Festivals were run for the love of music, the love of the vibrations, and of love itself. It should be about the whole festival experience, not just the party then waking up on Monday and going home feeling drained. \n\"Our festival is more of a journey. You're not just coming to a party; that's the reason it's five days - chilling on Thursday, everybody parties on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday until the early hours, and then from midday on Monday it's about wellbeing, yoga, ambient music.\" Read More The Manchester bakery where punters queue for AN HOUR for sourdough loaves, cruffins and croissants \nTickets are now on sale, priced £105-£145 for the full five days. Day tickets are also available for Friday to Sunday, priced £50 per day, and children until 16 go free with a paying adult (a free ticket is required). \nCoach tickets and car parking passes can also be arranged via the website. \nThe festival is currently looking for volunteers to help with stewarding, stage management, litter picking, bar work, and other roles on site.
