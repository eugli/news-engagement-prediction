Industries are split into high, medium, and low-priority brackets. Financial services, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture are among \"high priority\" sectors. Oil and gas, telecoms, and education are considered \"low priority.\" \nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May holds a press conference with her counterpart from Italy Paolo Gentiloni (not shown) at Number 10 Downing Street in London, February 9, 2017. Reuters/Facundo Arrizabalaga \nLONDON — Prime Minister Theresa May's government has ranked industries based on how much Brexit assistance they believe they will need, focusing attention on areas like banking and finance at the expense of sectors such as oil and gas. \nA leaked document obtained by Sam Coates of The Times shows that May's team has ranked British industry in order of how much assistance Downing Street believes the sector will need once Brexit talks begin in earnest after Article 50 is triggered. \nThe categories are not believed to denote how important the government sees the industries as being to the British economy, but rather help delineate which will need special attention thanks to complications related to untangling themselves from the European Union. \nAmong the high priority sectors mentioned by the document — which is thought to have been produced in November — are financial services and banking, both of which have received substantial media attention since the vote. \nThe continuing role of the City of London as Europe's main financial hub has been one of the most contentious issues in recent months, with warnings that Britain's likely loss of financial service passporting rights could devastate the sector. As recently as Friday morning, German financial regulator Andreas Dombret said: \"The current model of using London as a gateway to Europe is likely to end.\" \nFinance firms in the UK rely heavily on the passporting to do business on the continent, and vice versa, but this is under threat from Britain's impending departure from the European Single Market, to which the passport is closely tied. Current EU law allows European banks to operate branches in the UK that do not need to be separately capitalised from the parent company abroad. Similarly, non-EU banks, such as those from the US or Asia, can use their London subsidiary to sell services to clients across the EU. This has allowed London's financial centre to act as a hub for global firms looking to do business in the EU. \nOther industries that are considered high priority include agriculture — which relies heavily on seasonal migrant workers from the EU — and air transport, where several firms have already warned Brexit could spell disaster. \nAt the other end of the spectrum, the stricken steel industry, as well as oil and gas, are considered low priority. \n\"We do not comment on partial accounts of leaked documents . . . We have been doing detailed work to prepare for the negotiation, analysing more than 50 sectors and cross-cutting issues,\" a statement from a government spokesman cited by The Times said. The full list by sector \nHigh priority \nPharmaceuticals, automotive, textiles and clothing, aerospace, air transport, gas markets, agriculture, broadcasting, electricity, financial services, land transport (excluding rail), insurance, food and drink, and banking and market infrastructure. \nMedium priority \nElectronics, fisheries, chemicals, furniture and other manufacturing, parts and machinery. \nLow priority \nSteel construction, oil and gas, telecoms, post, environmental services, water, medical, retail, education, and professionals and business services.
