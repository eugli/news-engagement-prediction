It was read by some as expressing irritation that the Trump administration had not been forewarned of the Israeli plans ahead of a meeting between Trump and Netanyahu next Monday.\nWhy May and Netanyahu could regret embracing the president | Jonathan Freedland Read more \nSpeaking to Israeli reporters on Monday about the contacts with the White House, Netanyahu said: “That requires that we do not surprise our friends and keep them updated – and the American administration has been updated. This process was important for me, because we are trying to act this way, especially with very close friends. \n“I act responsibly and not according to different dictates and I will arrive [in Israel] tonight to vote on the law.”\nNetanyahu has been under huge pressure from his far right over the legislation, particularly from the education minister, Naftali Bennett. The bill was introduced amid discussions over the high-profile demolition of the Amona illegal outpost that began last week and was completed on Monday.\nThe proposed legislation follows hard on the heels of the approval of some 6,000 new Jewish settlement housing units in the occupied Palestinian territories since Trump’s inauguration.\nThe issue of Israeli settlement building has been thrust into the foreground since the passage of a UN security council resolution in December , supported by the outgoing Obama administration, which condemned settlements as a “flagrant violation” of international law and an obstacle to peace.\nSince Trump’s swearing-in, settler leaders and Bennett’s Jewish home party have been pushing Netanyahu, who is seen as weakened by a slew of police investigations , to push forward with building. Although the prime minister has chafed under the pressure he is largely dependent on Bennett to stay in office.\nIf adopted, the proposal would be seen as another step towards at least partial annexation of the West Bank, a key demand for parts of Netanyahu’s rightwing cabinet, including the hardline Jewish Home party.\nThe law is opposed, however, by some figures on the right including the hawkish defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, who said last week: “The chance that it will be struck down by the supreme court is 100%.”\nThe bill’s defenders argue it will allow settlers to live without fear of being driven from their homes – many of which they have lived in for years. They accuse Israel’s justice system of being controlled by leftwing anti-settlement groups.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T19:57:04.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
