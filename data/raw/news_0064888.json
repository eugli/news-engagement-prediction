Unused manufacturing capacity is the inverse of capacity utilization; nonemployment is Hornstein-Kudlyak-Lange Nonemployment index. Source: Federal Reserve Board, Reis, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond The unemployment rate is the most common measure of slack in the labor market, and it suggests that full employment has very nearly arrived: The 4.8 percent unemployment rate is roughly what Fed officials believe is the long-term rate that won’t provoke inflation, and not far from the 4.4 percent low in the last expansion. But there are important wrinkles. Millions of Americans left the labor force entirely in the aftermath of the last recession. And there are “missing” workers, people who do not count as unemployed because they are not looking for a job but might be available to work — and contribute to G.D.P. — if things were rosier. To people who work on employment issues, there is both good news and bad. “A third to a half of the people on the sidelines, it wouldn’t take much to employ tomorrow,” said Stefani Pashman, chief executive of Partner4Work, a work force development group in the Pittsburgh area. “The other half are much tougher to employ,” often facing challenges from drug use, criminal records and transience. That would seem to support the idea that there are meaningful numbers of would-be workers out there — but not an unlimited number. The Economic Policy Institute calculates that there are 1.85 million missing workers. Breaking a Cycle, With Risk In all these areas, the evidence points to an economy not being quite on the verge of overheating, but also not offering huge potential for growth. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Perhaps the best argument for policy makers to be cautious about putting the brakes on economic growth with rapid Fed interest rate increases is how much we don’t know about why growth has been so disappointing over the past several years. Here’s a weighty fact: In 2007, the Congressional Budget Office published long-term projections of potential G.D.P. that assumed the United States would grow around 2.7 percent a year for the ensuing decade. It didn’t. Growth in both the labor force and worker productivity underperformed those projections. So the reality we’re living in underperforms that theoretical potential by $2.2 trillion, or 14 percent. One possibility of what went wrong is that the damage of the deep 2008 recession had lasting effects, both pulling some Americans out of the work force and causing businesses to underinvest in innovations. Weak demand for goods and services damaged the capacity of the economy, producing a vicious cycle. If officials at the Fed and in the Trump administration try to run the economy a little hot — to keep pursuing faster growth even as the economy gets close to or above potential G.D.P. — it would be a chance to do the reverse, to create a virtuous cycle. Trying it carries risks of its own — of inflation, and perhaps new financial bubbles. The alternative is to take the low-growth world we’ve been living in as an immutable fact of life, and get used to it. \nThe Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.
