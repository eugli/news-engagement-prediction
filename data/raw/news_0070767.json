He is feeling terrible. \nHere's what happened, from Nina Paley: \n\"He attended a Muslim Studies class, in order to \"disagree\". There was a \"Muslim pastor\" from outside (not a prisoner) and about 18 Muslim prisoners in attendance. Amos called Allah a \"sky wizard\". He said that if the religion is 5,000 years old then it's \"complete fucking garbage\". (He said \"fuck\" a lot). He said that the Quran has passages instructing the devout to kill non-Muslims; the pastor handed him the Quran and challenged him to show such passages, and when Amos said \"Ok, I will\", the pastor took the Quran back. Advertisement \nThe pastor claimed \"The Quran was the most respected and popular book in the U.S.\" \nThe pastor said Amos was disturbing the peace or something and got Sergeant R.Henson to sign a form putting him in solitary. Amos is certain that he is in solitary for punitive reasons, not for his own protection. \nHe has been in solitary for 3 days. He doesn't know how long he will be there. They don't let him write, don't give him paper. They let him out for one hour per day. \nAmos was \"kicking, screaming, and banging the door yelling \"LET ME OUT\", other prisoners heard him, the \"police\" came, opened his door, took a look, and left. \nAmos wants us to \"tell his story\" on Facebook, share with the global secular human rights movement, get on CNN and the Rubin Report. He wants the Rubin Report to interview me and Melissa to tell Amos's story. \"These people don't know what they're messing with. We gotta destroy them.\"\"MAKE IT BIG\". \"This is a free speech issue and everyone will be on my side\". \n++++ \nMy main concern right now is for Amos's mental health. Solitary must be making it much worse. \nSource: Please see attached screenshot from facebook group \"Operation Singaporean Freedom: Amos Yee\" Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
