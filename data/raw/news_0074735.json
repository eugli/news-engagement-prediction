Beyond the doctrines and dogma, the do's and the don't's, religion is simply a framework for thinking about the existential questions we all struggle with as human beings. It is, as the Sufi mystics say, a \"signpost to God.\" Can you have faith without religion? Of course! But as the Buddha said, if you want to strike water, you don't dig six 1-foot wells; you dig one 6-foot well. In other words, if you want to have a deep and meaningful faith experience, it helps -- though it is by no means necessary -- to have a language with which to do so. So then, pick a well. Different words, same thing My well is Islam, and in particular, the Sufi tradition. Let me be clear, I am Muslim not because I think Islam is \"truer\" than other religions (it isn't), but because Islam provides me with the \"language\" I feel most comfortable with in expressing my faith. It provides me with certain symbols and metaphors for thinking about God that I find useful in making sense of the universe and my place in it. So... what do you believe? \nWhat's your most unshakeable belief, and why? Share your personal story on CNN.com/IBelieve or upload a video on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter with #IBelieve. But I know, just as the Buddha did, that while my personal well may be different and unique, the water I draw from it is the same water drawn from everyone else's wells. Indeed, having drunk from many wells in my spiritual journey, I consider it my mission in life to inform the world that, no matter the well, the water tastes just as sweet. Consider the following parable by the great Sufi master Jalal ad-Din Rumi, which I recount in my book, \"No god but God\": A Persian, a Turk, an Arab and a Greek are traveling to a distant land when they begin arguing over how to spend the single coin they share in common. The Persian wants to spend the coin on angur; the Turk, on uzum; the Arab, on inab; and the Greek, on stafil. A linguist passing by overhears the argument. \"Give the coin to me,\" he says. Taking the coin, the linguist goes to a nearby shop and buys the travelers four small bunches of grapes. \"This is my angur!\" cries the Persian. \"But this is what I call uzum,\" replies the Turk. \"You have brought me my inab,\" the Arab says. \"No! This in my language is stafil,\" says the Greek. The travelers suddenly realize that they were all asking for the same thing, but in different languages. My goal -- as a scholar, as a person of faith, and now as the host of \"Believer\" -- is to be the linguist, to demonstrate that, while we may speak in different religions, we are, more often than not, often expressing the same faith. And that, regardless of whether you, too, are a believer or not, is a lesson worth learning.
