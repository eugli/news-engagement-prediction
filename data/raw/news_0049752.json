For the next couple of weeks, reporter Shannon Martin looks at the precarious life of a renter. Warning: it's not pretty. (Petar Valkov/CBC Toronto) \nShannon Martin Reporter, CBC Toronto \nShannon is a story-teller with CBC Toronto. She has a special interest in covering women and children's issues, barriers facing the LGBTQ community, and the struggles and successes of new Canadians. If you happen to meet her on the streets of Toronto with her Yorkie, Gus, say hello! Though she'll probably beat you to it (part of her prairie upbringing in friendly Manitoba). Contact Shannon: shannon.martin@cbc.ca & follow her on Twitter/ Instagram/ Snapchat: @ShannonMartinTV. \nI'm 32 years old, work at my dream job and have an amazing circle of family and friends who love me. Life is pretty great. \nThere's just one thing — and I can't believe I'm about to admit this you, buut here goes. \nRight now, I live nowhere in particular. \nI'm a couch surfer. \nFor the record, I did have a nice place. But then my rent went up nearly $1,000 per month. \nLet's backtrack for a moment. \nI arrived in Toronto in 2011 from the prairies; bright eyed, ambitious, and totally naive. Chasing a childhood dream to live, work, and build a life in what I believe is best city in the world. Almost everyone back home peppered me with questions: isn't Toronto too big, too loud, and most of all, too expensive? I sold my home in Winnipeg, where owning property in your 20s and 30s is more doable, before moving to Toronto in 2011. (Shannon Martin) \n\"I'll make it work,\" I said, having no idea what that actually meant. \nI managed to, for the first few years. Living with my then-boyfriend, we split the rent and bills. \nWhen we broke up, I was suddenly alone in the big city. \nNo problem, I told myself. 'I'll make it work' \nDowntown is full of young professionals, just like me. We work hard, play harder. It's what we do. \nHustle. \nI moved into my teeny tiny 454-square-foot apartment in January 2016. Small but cute — just like me, I joked to anyone who'd listen. \nAt $1,650 a month, plus hydro, things were tight. But, swapping stories over $1-an-ounce red wine at Gusto with my girlfriends, I quickly realized I was far from alone. \nWhether we work in media, pharmacy or public relations, most of us are forking over well over 50 per cent of our paycheque to put a roof over our heads. \n'Whether we work in media, pharmacy or public relations, most of us are forking over well over 50 per cent of our paycheque to put a roof over our heads.' \nThen my lease renewal arrived in late September. \nI anticipated a bump in rent and was already making a mental list of expenses I could axe (who needs Wi-Fi when I could \"borrow\" from the restaurant next door?). \nI opened the email from my property manager and there it was in black and white. \nMy rent was soaring $950 a month to an astronomical $2,600. \nAt first I laughed. It had to be a typo. A misprint. Above guide rental increases are perfectly legal, depending where you live. \nBut as I scrolled through the PDF and saw the amount repeated, any laughter died, as Drake would say, into a dry cry ('cause I'm hopeless.) 'You're screwed' \nI called the Ontario Landlord and Tenant Board and the guy who answered my call broke it down for me in two words: \nYou're screwed. \nReal estate lawyer Mark Weisleder confirmed the worst of it. \n\"You're at the whim of your landlord,\" he told me. \n\"It can be a real painful surprise for tenants.\" \nThe painful surprise is that if you live in a building that is 25 years old or less, you have no rent-control protection. \nUnder Ontario's Residential Tenancies Act, rental units built after November 1991 are exempt from the annual Rent Increase Guideline aka rent control. \nRent increases at renewal time, 20 to 30 per cent or in my case much much more, is something many Torontonians are now dealing with,. Especially in the downtown core, where so many of us want to live. \nGeordie Dent, with the Federation of Metro Tenants' Associations, says his organization gets a \"steady stream\" of annual rent increases that exceed the guidelines set by the province. \nAnd that's not all. \nThere are bidding wars for basement apartments, open houses with line-ups around the block. \n\"Toronto's rental market is bananas,\" Dent tells me, shrugging his shoulders. If you're renting in the downtown core in a newer condominium tower, chances are you aren't protected by rent control. (John Rieti/CBC) Average GTA condo rent: $2K per month \nAnd, unfortunately, it only gets more grim. \nWe're paying more than ever, too. \nAccording to Urbanation Inc, which tracks everything condo related in the GTA, the average condo rent for a one-bedroom is now about $2,000 a month. \nThat's up 12 per cent from the year before. \nHow much did your salary increase last year? That's what I thought. Share your stories \nFor me, I had no choice but to move. I packed everything into storage, and now I'm floating around until I figure out the future. \nBut here's what keeps me up at night: I have a good job, I've saved some cash. \nI'm fortunate I have family and friends who'll put me up for a couple weeks at a time. \nWhat about students? Single moms? People who work two or three jobs just to make ends meet? How are you getting by? \nShare your stories about trying to find housing in this city. I'll look for solutions and examine what the future may hold. \nHere's how you can get in touch: \n​Email me at Shannon.Martin@CBC.ca or join our Facebook group and be a part of the conversation.
