Article continues below \n“Nate’s a f g b***h, and let me tell you why. X-RATED RANT \n“I had the biggest respect for Nate – and I still have big respect for Nick, he’s out doing his thing – but when [Nate] took that phone call or that video call from Floyd Mayweather, and was like, ‘hello Floyd’s fans,’ he was Floyd’s b***h that night. \n“I was like, you f g p***y. You absolute p***y. \n“When he had that video call, he should’ve been on the other end of that line and when Floyd was saying ‘you made McGregor tap out,’ he’s like, ‘yeah I did,’ and Floyd is saying, ‘I’m going to finish the job.’ \n“He should’ve said, ‘shut your f g mouth or I’ll strangle you too!’ and then post that everywhere. \n“And then all of a sudden, it would’ve been like, f**k Floyd. It would’ve be me and Nate again. But he was Floyd’s b***h that night. He was Floyd’s employee that night. \n“So look, f**k Nate. F**k Nick. F**k the Diaz Brothers. And if you want to be down with the Diaz Brothers, then f**k you too. \n“I was expecting a different situation, but I couldn’t believe it when I watched it. I watched like 10 minutes of it, and Floyd’s like, ‘hey Nate, say hello to my fans.’ \n“You f g b***h. It’s the biggest b***h move I’ve ever seen. So, whatever, it is what it is. Now you’re back in the queue. Now you’re at the back of the queue.” \nOuch. \nThat’s probably the platform the Irishman needed to let his true feelings out, and fans will eagerly be waiting to see if Nate will have a comeback, if he decides to hit back at all. \nWhat do you make of Conor McGregor’s comments?
