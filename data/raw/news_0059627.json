Helping them are (from left) Serene Zara Taufiq and Medina Zaharah. \nKUALA LUMPUR: Actress Lisa Surihani has taken on arguably the most important role of her career as a Unicef national ambassador. \nThe role will see Lisa addressing issues such as violence against children, cyber-bullying, sexual exploitation and abuse, and digital safety. \n“As a mother, I feel a sense of responsibility to work on these issues,” said Lisa. \n“When Unicef offered me this role, it was a golden opportunity to learn how to advocate, and learn the right parameters to do so especially in this new age.” \nIt won’t be the first time Lisa has supported efforts to promote child protection. \nThe 30-year-old is one of the faces of The Star ’s R.AGE ongoing MPs Against Predators campaign for laws against child sexual grooming. \nShe has also lent her star power (alongside comedian Harith Iskander, actor Fahrin Ahmad and recording artiste Hunny Madu) to help promote the national “Hentikan!!” child sexual crimes awareness seminar on Mar 13-14. \nUnicef Malaysia representa-tive Marianne Clark-Hattingh said Lisa was a natural choice for the role. \n“R.AGE’s Predator In My Phone campaign enhanced Lisa’s engagement in protecting and championing children’s rights,” said Clark-Hattingh. \n“She has demonstrated her commitment to championing these issues ever since, and we are very happy to have her on board.” \nLisa joins the likes of David Beckham, Jackie Chan and Upin & Ipin as Unicef global celebrity goodwill ambassadors for children.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:03:06.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
