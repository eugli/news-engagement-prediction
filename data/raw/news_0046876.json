Creme eggs \nThe chocolate-based calorie bomb was originally posted to Omm-Nomm.com . \nEssentially it is a Cadbury Creme Egg surrounded by chocolate cake and buttercream before being smothered in melted and grated chocolate. \nWe recreated the recipe for a video and constructed a step-by-step guide, here is what happened: \nIngredients \nMcDonald's at Manchester Arena has closed after 17 years in business \nMethod Preheat oven to 160 degrees Celsius (gas mark 3) and grease or line an 8 inch (20cm) cake tin. Cream the butter and sugar. When light in texture, add the rest of the cake mix ingredients - remember to sieve the flour and cocoa powder to reduce clumps. If the batter is too thick, add a splash of milk. Pour the mixture into the cake tin, spreading evenly. Place in the oven and bake for around 25 minutes, until the cake is firm and springy. Take the cake out of the oven and allow to cool for 15 minutes. Once the cake is cooled, remove from the tin and crumble in a food processor until it resembles breadcrumbs. Add the remainder of your softened butter, icing sugar and cocoa, mixing until a firm dough is formed (similar to shortcrust pastry). Take handfuls of the dough, encase each Creme Egg and roll into fist-sized balls. Place each egg onto a plate covered with baking paper, pop into a fridge to chill While the dough balls are cooling, grate 100g of chocolate into a bowl. Melt the remaining 200g of chocolate in a bowl over a pan of hot water, or in a microwave, until lumps have melted. Once firm, take your dough balls out of the fridge and dip into the chocolate mixture. Roll the eggs in the grated chocolate, covering the entire surface, and place back on to cooling try. Cool your Scotch Creme Eggs in the fridge for 10 minutes and serve. poll loading Will you be trying to make the Creme Scotch Egg? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:36:37.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
