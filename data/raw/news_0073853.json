But he also accused US President Donald Trump of blundering around without even a basic understanding of the country. SHARE 'We don't seem to have a long-term strategy': Former US ambassador to China Max Baucus. Photo: New York Times \nChina, Mr Baucus said, has a long-term strategic vision to build up its economic might and global influence. The US, by contrast, often appears distracted by problems in the Middle East. \n\"The Washington foreign policy establishment tends to put China on another shelf, to deal with it later,\" he said. \"We're much too ad hoc. We don't seem to have a long-term strategy, and that's very much to our disadvantage.\" Related Content Trump's withdrawal from Asia trade 'a giant gift' to China \nMr Baucus spoke by Skype from his home in Montana on Thursday, looking out over a beautiful valley framed by snowy mountains, where he sits and watches the storms roll in. \nBeing ambassador to China, he said, was \"the best job I ever had\", even if his tenure there was abruptly ended by Mr Trump's election victory. Advertisement \nMr Baucus, who also spent more than three decades as a Senate Democrat, is proud to have visited all of China's mainland provinces during his time there. He said he worked hard to prevent the two nations from falling into what has been called the Thucydides trap , a theory that an established power feels threatened by a rising power, leading to a rivalry that often descends into war. \nBut making the relationship work takes serious thought in Washington, he said, something that Mr Baucus said did not always happen during his time in the job.

What's the strategy going forward?' \" \nAmong his complaints: that the Obama administration had not done enough to get the Trans-Pacific Partnership ratified by Congress , despite the hard work that US trade representative Michael Froman put into the 12-nation Asia-Pacific trade pact.

Photo: AP \nEven before leaving Beijing, though, he was shocked to see Mr Trump speak by telephone with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and publicly question US adherence to the One China policy. \nThat, he said, had been \"a major blunder, a huge mistake\" by Trump, who was eventually forced to back down in a subsequent phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

He's forgotten Taiwan and One China is non-negotiable,\" he said. \"You don't understand China, you don't understand Taiwan, you've not even graduated from high school yet.\" \nMr Baucus also warned of the dangers of the US becoming a protectionist \"island\" under Trump, both economically and in terms of immigration, a direction that would only cede global space and influence to China. \nIn an exclusive interview with Fairfax Media in December, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull highlighted the difficulties for Australia of the new administration's approach to China, insisting that Canberra would chart its own course on Taiwan and trade. \nMr Baucus was not entirely negative about the new administration, praising Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \nJulie Bishop and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson meet at the State Department in Washington earlier this month.

But we have to ask ourselves: 'What are our bottom lines?' \" he said. \"Where can we be pushed no further?\" \nWhile Mr Tillerson told his Senate confirmation hearing that \"we're going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building [in the South China Sea] stops and, second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed\", Foreign Minister Julie Bishop used her recent visit to Washington to cast a veil over those remarks and insist that Australia would urge \"that there be a de-escalation of tensions and that the parties resolve their differences peacefully\". \nWhether it is in economics, the South China Sea or cybersecurity, Mr Baucus said, the United States has to decide where the red lines lie and be prepared to take firm action if those lines are crossed - action that should be measured in \"deeds more than words\". \n\"There's no question they're going to test us,\" he said. \"It's an authoritarian government, and they're going to keep pushing.\" \nWashington Post, Fairfax Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:03:43.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
