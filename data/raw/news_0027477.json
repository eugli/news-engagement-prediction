San Francisco and San Diego have similar programs, and the pilot may be based on those. \nMore than 3,900 people are estimated to be living in their cars in LA County, according to the 2016 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count. \nLADOT does not currently have statistics on the number of parking citations that are issued to homeless individuals. But when the program is put in place, the agency says it will begin to gather data. \n(©2016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc. All Rights Reserved.
