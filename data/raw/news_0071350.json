You'll slowly stop moving, you'll stop talking, your body functions won't function so you end up like a vegetable.\" \nBack then doctors were mystified by little Sofia's condition. \nThe stroke was the final catastrophic event that ended months of seizures and years of health problems. \nIt would taken even more time and a team of researchers at Yale Medical School before doctors discovered what was making Sofia so sick. \nEventually they discovered a rare genetic disorder that affected her metabolism. \nShe is thought to be one of only 40 people in the world with the condition. \nThe official diagnosis is: Combined Cobalamin C Defect with Methylmalonic Aciduria and Homocystinuria. \nBut really it is a fancy name for saying Ms Belmonte's body cannot turn vitamin B12 in food into its active form in the body. \nShe needs about three vitamin B-12 injections each week to stop amino acids building up in her body and causing another stroke.

Email Vitamin-B12 injections key to survival \nFor Ms Belmonte, access to these injections has suddenly got harder. \nShe's a disability pensioner and her monthly medication bill is already in the hundreds of dollars. Photo: Sofia Belmonte has a petition to get B12 shots back on the PBS. (Supplied) \nNow the Federal Government has added to that bill by removing subsidies for her Vitamin B12 injections from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). \nIt means what used to cost her $6.30 now costs her $30 a week; over a year that's more than $1,500. \nIt was part of a push to stop people spending more on medications by prescription that were actually cheaper over the counter . \nBut people like Ms Belmonte have become unintended victims of the crackdown. \nOff-the-shelf B12 medications do not work for her because they are chemically different. \nDespite representations from her doctors, the PBS would not make an exception for people with medical need. \nDr Kaustuv Bhattacharya said he and metabolic doctors from the Australian Society of Inborn Errors of Metabolism wrote to the PBS stating it was imperative B12 injections were funded. \nThere are others with conditions similar, but not the same, as Ms Belmonte who also need regular injections. \n\"We informed the PBS that our patients required these injections as part of treatment for their rare genetic condition,\" Dr Bhattacharya said. \n\"Some of my other patients are really severe. \n\"Untreated, these patients can become blind, be institutionalised, have intellectual deficit, having severe and permanent brain injury, paralysis and even death. \n\"In this case, as in several others, the PBS has not listened to specialist advice for therapeutic interventions from experts in rare diseases.\" Cost of medications adds up with rare diseases \nVitamin B12 injections are not the only drug people like Ms Belmonte struggle to access. \n\"One of my medications, which is folic acid, I used to get for what would be now $6.30,\" she said.

(Supplied) \n\"But now I have to pay $140 to get it made by a special chemist because what's on the shelf isn't exact enough to make my body function.\" \nMs Belmonte has started a petition calling on the Government to reconsider its position on the Neo-B12 injections. \n\"For rare people like me and for people that have cancers or have dementia or have broad spectrum diseases, they should get their medicines on the PBS,\" she said. \nRare Voices Australia executive officer Nicole Millis said people like Ms Belmonte often fell victim to a health system that did not cater to them in areas that ranged from diagnostics to medications. \n\"Unfortunately I'm not surprised, we've heard of a lot of examples like this,\" she said. \n\"The health system is not geared to respond to rare disease, it's geared towards diseases with larger patient cohorts. \n\"There's very few treatments for rare disease and often when there is a treatment developed it can be quite expensive and it can be difficult for patients to access it without government support. \n\"In this case, government doesn't understand the importance of the medicines and just with a blanket policy change rare disease is discriminated against.\" \nIn a statement, the Federal Health Department said the legislation governing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme did not allow exceptions for individuals. \n\"When purchased without a prescription, the cost for a box of three vitamin B12 injections should be very similar to the PBS concessional co-payment of $6.30,\" the statement read. \n\"However, pharmacies are private businesses, so the price may vary from pharmacy to pharmacy. \n\"Consumers should shop around.\" \nFour decades since her stroke, Ms Belmonte still suffers some of the side-effects from the stroke and has a range of symptoms related to her rare condition. \nThe threat of having another stroke always looms large. \n\"The thing is I know I can go back there any time, it's in the back of your mind,\" she said. \n\"If the levels become unbalanced it can take you back so you're in the shell of a body and you won't be able to communicate to people.\" \nRare Diseases Day is February 28.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:37:36.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
