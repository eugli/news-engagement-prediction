To have narrowly missed such an eminent office that influences African affairs, policy and direction is disappointing. The preparation, resources, and lobbying that was invested in her campaign was last seen when the ICC cases were boring down on the presidency. Many reasons are being proffered for the loss, but the overarching cause was the perennial wedge put by our different colonial masters. Back home, as expected this has been labeled a Jubilee loss. The opposition was beside itself celebrating the loss albeit in subdued ways. The social media went wild with the allusion of corruption having been the reason why Kenya lost. For an average follower of international politics, it might as well have been because that is what he/she is served on media headlines every morning.A cursory look at the opposition campaign strategy spanning the last 10 years, one cannot fail to see the role of volatile propaganda in rallying the masses against the competitors. Whereas this is typical of any competing political scenario, the Raila Odinga led opposition in Kenya has not shied away from utilizing catastrophe-laden propaganda including tribal segregation as experienced in the 2007 general elections. With his 41 against 1 strategy, Raila set the country on a warpath that shall remain the darkest moment of this Republic after colonialism.Fast forward to the current pre-election period, Raila who is said to have retained numerous foreign advisors has arrived at one germane issue that he is running with towards August 8th 2017. Seeing that the tribal alienation card has failed to gather traction this time round, he has built his entire arsenal around corruption. From expert eyes, this may be a sure winning tactic but unfortunately, it comes laden with one problem. Unlike tribe which is said to have spell-binding effects on a common group, corruption is a crime of choice.To castigate corruption, the minimum expectations are that one should have verifiable evidence on hand and should also be of good moral standing. These attributes, unfortunately, cannot be associated with the former Prime Minister. Not only has he been accused of being corrupt, he is alleged to have been the mastermind of mega scandals during his time in the coalition government. Corruption is evil. It doesn’t matter who the perpetrator is. The foreign advisors reluctantly arrived at corruption as the ‘silver bullet’ that shall penetrate the Jubilee government’s breastplate and Raila has ever since been shouting on rooftops.Raila should focus on voter registration and mobilization and more so give this highly progressive country a comprehensive proposal of an alternative government, policies, and plans.
