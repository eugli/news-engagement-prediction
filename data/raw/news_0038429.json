Share this video   Thank you for subscribing!   \nTwenty years ago, when everyone was younger and less jaded, a generation of youths swallowed James Cameron's Titanic wholly and unquestioningly. \nSure, not everyone liked the film, but to a pre-teen spending an entire fortnight's pocket money watching Jack and Rose's doomed love affair, Titanic was a straightforward epic romance-disaster movie. \nThe passage of time does funny things though. \nNow, the film has been analysed with a fine tooth-comb so many times, it's basically taken on a whole new different meaning. \nTo celebrate it's 20 year anniversary, here's one of our favourites. Back when they were happy Jack Dawson from Titanic was a time traveller. \nFree-spirit and lover of French women, Jack's entire existence has been called into question several times over on forums such as Reddit . \nWhile we doubt James Cameron intended this sci-fi slant, the evidence is there that Jack was some sort of dandy time lord. Here it is. \nWe learn later on the film that was no record of a Jack Dawson on board the Titanic, this is because he won his ticket in a game of poker against two Swedish men. Your hair's all wrong, mate (Photo: 20th Century Fox/Paramount Pictures) \nThink about it. If Jack were a time-traveller, then he would have no currency for whichever era he was living in, so would have to live by his wits. \nRedditor Markharris1939 even picks holes in Jack's haircut, which was a little too long for the fashion in 1912. \nHis language too is somewhat anachronistic. He asks Cal if he can \"bum a smoke\". The slang word for 'borrow' reportedly originated during the American Civil War, over 50 years prior to the Titanic's maiden voyage. Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater and Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson in Titanic (Photo: 20th Century Fox) \nBut it's the inconsistencies in Jack's story (also known as historical inaccuracies) which stand out the most. \nJack's rucksack, for example, has been dated as being made in 1939. \nOne of the many plans and dreams he shares with Rose is to take her on the roller coaster on Santa Monica Pier, but this would not be built until four years after the Titanic sank. \nIn the scant information he reveals about his past, he says he grew up in Wisconsin, and went ice-fishing with his dad on Lake Wissota. Our mind can't cope (Photo: REX) \nAll very well and good, except man-made Lake Wissota was not completed until 1917... \nFive years ago, American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson also told Cameron that the night sky portrayed in the film was not an accurate representation of the actual constellations. \nThis has nothing to do with Jack as such, although people are keen to point that this is because - deep breath and suspend your disbelief one second - Jack's time machine malfunctions... Is Jame's Cameron's epic film also about time-travel? (Photo: Twentieth Century Fox) \nIf the time-traveller theory seems completely plausible to you, it then raises the question, why did he board a doomed ship? Many people seem to think Jack's mission on board was to save Rose. \nAs any Titanic fan worth their salt knows, the star-crossed lovers met when he saved her from jumping off the ship. \nA gallant and romantic act of bravery, certainly. Except it altered the course of history and may have sealed the fate of the ship. Was he sent to save Rose? \nHad Rose jumped, the Titanic would have most likely stopped. During the time it was stationary, the course of the iceberg would have changed. There are two options here. \nEither Jack only looked and spoke how he did and knew what he did because he could bend the time-space continuum to his will, picking up phrases, knowledge and fashion as went along. \nOR, someone responsible for the storyboard did not look these things up on Encarta (Wikipedia did not exist in 1997). \nAlso, he is just a fictional character from a film based on one of biggest tragedies of the twentieth century.
