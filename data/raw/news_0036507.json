ZipRealty The East Bay housing market along the Oakland-Berkeley corridor is red hot even as San Francisco and Silicon Valley begins to cool, real estate sources told the San Francisco Business Times Tuesday. “We’re seeing demand that’s more of a panic. As San Francisco and Silicon Valley starts to cool, the exact opposite has occurred here,” Vanessa Bergmark , owner and president of Oakland-based Red Oak Realty, which also operates an office in Berkeley. A home at 775 Brooklyn Ave. in Oakland. ZipRealty “Since interest rates crept up, and even though they have since slid back down, we’ve seen our buyer response heat up enormously.” Echoing that assessment was a Bay Area housing report issued this week by San Francisco-based Paragon Real Estate Group . The report captured just how hot things are in Oakland since the historic housing bubble burst in 2008. “Oakland had a very large subprime bubble, a huge 60 percent crash, and then a sensational recovery highly pressurized by being just across the bridge from San Francisco — and much more affordable,” Paragon said. “The Oakland median house price is up a staggering 182 percent since 2011. Because it’s subprime bubble was so big, it is only 12 percent above its 2007 price.” No wonder HomeUnion, an online property management, calls Oakland one of the best markets for real estate investors, who are advised to consider putting their money into Rockridge, Lake Merritt and even West Oakland. “West Oakland makes the list because of its low entry prices, relative to other Oakland neighborhoods,” said HomeUnion spokeswoman Stacey Corso . Fans of West Oakland have long known that it was only a matter of time before that area’s proximity to downtown San Francisco, BART connection and fabulous Victorian housing stock would catch the eye of more investors. Checking in with those who stand between home buyers and sellers tells the story. “At our company meeting Monday, the talk was all ‘pre-emptive offers, double-digit bidding wars, and continued panic-inducing lack of inventory,’” Bergmark said, who asked her team of about 100 agents to share with her their experiences with home buyers and sellers after seeing a Business Times report Tuesday that suggested waning bidding wars is the “new normal.” One Red Oak agent said his buyer lost out to an all-cash buyer in a $1.395 million inner East Bay listing that sold for about $1.7 million; another says a Berkeley listing for $789,000 received 19 offers with a sale pending. Another got a dozen offers for a listing in nearby Richmond — and a pending sale in the Richmond Annex for $599,000 got 32 offers and is likely to fetch an all-cash deal well over $700,000. An agent for a listing in Oakland’s Laurel District, taking offers today, said, “So far 18 agents have confirmed they will be bringing us an offer. Four are in my mailbox this morning — and that’s before 7 a.m.” Many prospective home buyers are concerned about the Trump administration’s policy proposals and what it means for interest rates, Bergmark said. Given how costly a rate increase is over the life of a mortgage, some buyers are deciding it’s better to overbid and lock in a deal now. Bergmark expects the strong buying in the inner East Bay to last about six months before things cool. “We always look to what’s happening with housing in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, because we get the spillover effects,” said Bergmark, a former New Yorker who moved to San Francisco before buying her first home in Oakland in 2002. She has spent much of her career since then encouraging others to follow her lead, with ads touting the ability to have an outdoor barbecue in July without bundling up as one does in chilly San Francisco that time of year. “We love San Francisco homebuyers in the East Bay,” she quipped. The word’s been out for some time on Oakland’s affordability, relatively speaking. This month Zillow said the Bay Area’s five hottest neighborhoods are all in Oakland. (What the city’s home buyers save on housing costs, they can get a security system and start a block watch, Bergmark says.) Bergmark said she expects the always popular spring home buying season to be marked by even more frenzied buying as this month’s overbidding leads to higher comps, which can support stronger bidding and larger mortgages. “We may not see a rise in sales, but we’ll see a jump in prices this spring,” she predicted. Homebuyers are venturing well beyond Oakland and Berkeley in their search for the American dream, with bidding wars extending to other inner East Bay cities such as El Cerrito and Richmond. “San Leandro is the city to watch,” Bergmark said. “Everyone who can’t afford Oakland is heading to what was once a ’sleeper city.’” Join the conversation: Follow @SFBusinessTimes on Twitter, \"Like\" us on Facebook and sign up for our free email newsletters.
