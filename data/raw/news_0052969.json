The dance ordinance, with a penalty of $25, prohibited dance halls within 500 feet of a church or public school. \nIn February, resident Joni Insabella decided to host a dance above her store, which is within 500 feet of a church. The city's Chamber of Commerce posted about the event and called Insabella a rule breaker on Facebook and accused her of getting special treatment, because of her husband, who's the city's attorney. \n\"We wanted just a good, clean, fun event. As I said, we know we're in the Bible Belt. We weren't having alcohol or anything. We just wanted it to be fun for the community,\" Insabella said. \nAfter the event was canceled, Mayor Jennifer Clason decided to look over the ordinance. \nClason, the city's first female mayor, said when the dance ban resurfaced it received national attention for its similarity to the 1980s film \"Footloose,\" which tells the story of a small town banning dancing and rock music. She said prior to the cancelled event, she'd never heard of the ordinance preventing dancing. \nPreviously, dances were held at the city's churches and schools without repercussions, said Clason.
