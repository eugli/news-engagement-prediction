The newest member of the Maryland football recruiting class is one of the least known. In a surprise, he also might be the best. (Jonas Shaffer) \n“It’s hard to wipe the smile off my face right now. It’s a great day for our program, great day for our team,” Durkin said. “Can’t tell you how excited we are, just a tremendous day for all of us in the direction we’re moving and improving.” \nOf the 28 players who signed, there are a program-record five among the ESPN300. There are 17 players from the Delaware-Maryland-Virginia corridor. One four-star recruit -- running back Cordarrian Richardson, who made a surprise commitment to Maryland on Wednesday -- has yet to sign his letter of intent. \nWhile he would not single out any individual player as the prize catch of this year’s class, four-star quarterback Kasim Hill of St. John’s College High in Washington is likely going to be the most talked about going into next season should he win the competition with North Carolina transfer Caleb Henderson. That's in part because Dwayne Haskins, one of the \"founders\" of \"The Movement,\" decommitted from Maryland and signed with Ohio State a year ago. As an up-and-coming assistant coach at West Virginia nearly a decade ago, Chris Beatty thought he had a five-star prospect locked up heading into National Signing Day. (Don Markus) \n“Kasim’s special in that anyone who follows football can put on a tape and watch him and know that he’s a tremendous talent,” Durkin said of Hill, who lives in Crofton. “He can make all the throws, he can beat you running the ball. He’s 230 pounds. The guy is a freak of nature. \n“But that doesn’t even scratch the surface to what Kasim’s all about. That’s why we’re so happy to bring him in. That’s what makes him different than other guys; it’s his leadership ability -- what he’s all about, what he stands for, what his family is all about.” \nBecause he was one of the first four-star players to commit last summer, Hill became an attraction for other recruits, Durkin said. \n“Absolutely, he was a huge part of putting this class together, because he has that leadership quality about him,” Durkin said. “I talked to him on the phone today and I told him, ‘It doesn’t stop now. You are viewed as a leader by the guys you’re coming in with, your peers, and that’s going to continue by the position he plays.” \nSaid Mike Farrell, national recruiting director for Rivals.com, “Given the position he plays and the fact that Maryland has had trouble recruiting quarterbacks, Kasim Hill is the most important player in this class.” \nCornerback Deon Jones of Oxon Hill said Hill’s decision to commit to Maryland last spring factored into his July commitment. \n“You started to have faith. Someone has to jump in first,” Jones said Wednesday. “By Kasim committing first, it reopened a lot of guys’ eyes. He played a big role in this commitment process.” \nBoth Jones and safety Markquese Bell of Bridgeton, N.J., are among the seven players that have enrolled in school and will be eligible to practice with the team this spring. According to 247sports.com, Jones was the 175th-ranked player in the nation, Bell was 191st and Hill was 240th. \n“There’s a lot of opportunity, I think that’s why a lot of guys came in to get that early start,” Bell said. \nThat the Terps played 15 true freshmen in Durkin’s first season was a factor in the decision by Jones. \n“Definitely, knowing that I could play early, and especially in front of my hometown, my family, that’s what it’s all about,” said Jones. “Why go somewhere else when you can do it right here in your backyard?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:41:51.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
