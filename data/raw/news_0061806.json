An emotional Mr Shannon added: 'A grieving mother doesn't change with the colour of her hair, the area she lives in or the church that she attends. 'It can never do, and why should it? 'As the member of Parliament for Strangford, I call for this Government to turn round and take the only thing that they can do, and make sure that our people are given the credit and given the fairness that they should have.' Mr Shannon said bogus claims had been made 'to destroy the reputation of our armed forces', adding: 'This never can be allowed to happen.' The DUP said credible claims should have been distinguished from others more quickly, and that innocent until proven guilty should always have been the fall-back position when claims were made. Mr Shannon praised Tory MP Johnny Mercer for his investigation into the discredited Iraq Historic Allegations Team (Ihat). 'Because of that, I hope that the lessons will be learned by all ... never should claims without evidence be progressed,' said Mr Shannon. The Strangford MP said: 'I understand very well the concept of closure and wanting justice. I want justice for my cousin Kenneth Smith, who was murdered by the IRA.' As he was overcome with emotion again, Mr Shannon said: 'Never should we leave a man behind.' 'Never should service personnel be left out on a limb.' As he was overcome with emotion again, Mr Shannon said: 'Never should we leave a man behind.' Mr Shannon's comments came during a debate in which the DUP called for measures to be brought forward to ensure British veterans cannot face probes into their actions during conflicts if they have already been investigated. The party wants a statute of limitations to be introduced which would apply to those who served in Northern Ireland, as well as other war zones such as Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. The party's defence spokesman, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, hit out at human rights lawyers for their pursuit of those who served in the armed forces, police and security services. In an opposition day debate on historical cases in the armed forces, Tory former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth accused Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions Barra McGrory of issuing 'a fatwa' to the media to suppress criticism of his treatment of veterans. MPs also accused Sinn Fein of attempting to rewrite the history of the Troubles, turning the focus away from the IRA. Mr Shannon's emotional intervention came as MPs criticised investigations into the actions of British veterans who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said there was no 'moral equivalence' between soldiers who sought to uphold the law in Northern Ireland and 'terrorists who sought to destroy it'. He also said he recognised concerns that inquiries in Northern Ireland are disproportionately to do with cases allegedly involving the state. His colleague, Northern Ireland Minister Kris Hopkins, moved to assuage concerns relating to the reopening of cases as he said specific tests would have to be met before a proposed Historical Investigations Unit (HIU), due to be set up to look at Troubles killings, would consider acting. He said: 'The legislation requiring the HIU will include specific tests that must be met in order that previously completed cases can be reopened for investigation and specifically that new and credible evidence that was not previously available to the authorities is needed before the HIU will open closed cases.' He also acknowledged the current system is in need of reform. He said: 'The present system is not appropriate. It is disproportionate and we need a new system which was agreed under the Stormont Agreement.'
