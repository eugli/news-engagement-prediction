Kandyce Downer was meant to protect Shi-Anne but instead killed her Read More Barbaric foster mum who battered toddler to death leaving her with 153 injuries set to appeal life sentence \nMedics battled to save her, but she died from blood poisoning, infection, blunt chest trauma and head injuries. \nShi-Anne, from Birmingham, had only been in mum-of-four Kandyce's care for 10 months when she was murdered in September 2015. \nThe twisted foster mum was jailed for a minimum of 18 years and the case is an ever-lasting stain on Birmingham city council's reputation. \nNow a serious case review has found Shi-Anne was \"almost invisible to professionals\" who only visited her once between being handed over to Kandyce and her death, the Birmingham Mail reported . The tot's life was tragically cut short Read More \nShi-Anne was barely considered after the decision to issue the special guardianship order - a legal document giving Kandyce custody of the girl - was taken. \n“The voice of Shi-Anne was regularly missed,” the damning report states. \nAlthough it found no-one could have predicted Kandyce would turn into a child killer, the report said there were risk factors and more regular checks could have set alarm bells ringing. \nFactors that could have led to concerns about Kandyce's fitness to look after another child included: two historical episodes of domestic abuse, a period of stress leading to time off work, a new partner and an unplanned pregnancy, the report said.

As a result... Shi-Anne’s death couldn’t have been predicted. \n\"It is felt though, that if there was a supervision order in place... the opportunity for Kandyce Downer to carry out these assaults could have been prevented by the involvement of professional action and curiosity into the life of Kandyce Downer and the children - in particular Shi-Anne.” \nPenny Thompson, who chairs the Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board, said: \"As a result of this and other cases, national guidance on the use of special guardianship orders has been altered to be more robust and in Birmingham practice and management has fundamentally changed.
