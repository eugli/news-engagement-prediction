Filling a gap in the Northwestern perfume retail sector by offering the best of American and European indie, niche and artisan fragrances and toiletries, Fumerie quickly established a reputation for excellent selection, knowledgeable and friendly staff (owner Tracy Tsefalas and parfumier André Gooren ) and a comfortable, beautifully appointed atmosphere that recalls a European salon as much as a perfume boutique. Fumerie's cozy corner opposite the perfume bar One of the ways Fumerie engages its customers is by holding events that provide fragrance education, opportunities to explore notes and categories and a chance to meet and chat with the perfumers behind some of the 21st century's hottest brands. Such events are popular and valuable to members of the perfume community. However, Fumerie has taken things a step further with a series of events that no other boutique appears to be offering at this time: Fumerie hosts onsite fragrance swap events. In the age of the internet, swapping has became an important part of online perfume culture. Who amongst us hasn't fallen out of love with a once-treasured scent or made an impulse buy or blind buy that we regretted? Swapping helps all of us build collections of fragrances we love and encourages us to expand our fragrance horizons, all without breaking the bank. Many of us would not be the perfumistas we are today if the opportunity to swap had not been available. It stands to reason that each of Fumerie's swap events has been bigger than its predecessor—proof that the value of swapping extends to real life perfume communities, too. As Fumerie prepares for its third swap event, A Mid-Winter Night's Fragrance Swap on February 23, I talked with Tracy Tsefalas for some insights on the upcoming Swap. As you'll see, Fumerie goes the extra mile to ensure all participants have a positive experience, but a lot of her tips could apply to online swaps, too. Jodi Battershell: What prompted you to host swap events at Fumerie? Tracy Tsefalas: Over the years of working in fragrance retail, I've heard many describe the fact that they have bottles of fragrance that they don't use or have grown tired of, and they don't know what to do with these unloved scents. Many people aren't comfortable with eBay or alternate ways of selling their unused fragrance but don't want to throw them away either. It made me think of swaps that take place among friends, typically involving clothes, books or other items in a small gathering in a relaxed setting. Why not do the same with fragrance? Fumerie is a small, cozy space that offers a relaxed atmosphere that works well for these type of events. JB: Tell us a little about what we can expect if we attend a swap event. TT: Each participant has a designated space, the size of which depends on the number of items that they choose to bring. All fragrances are displayed with an accompanying sprayed scent strip to allow everyone a chance to smell each item. After everyone has had the opportunity to smell all of the offerings, the swapping begins. Either myself or André ask if anyone is interested in trading their items for what is offered in the first space and we continue down the line. Sometimes it's an even swap but other times, it gets a bit more complicated with an offering of two items for one (reflecting the perceived worth), or someone changing their mind about wanting to part with their brought item after all. Many of us have sentimental ties to scents that we don't realize until we are confronted with the threat of their loss. JB: What kinds of fragrances can we expect to find at the swap? TT: This is the fun part! It's an extensive variety ranging from simple, inexpensive items, up to highly collectible, discontinued vintage scents. On both of our previous swaps, there were over 100 items available, a few that I had not had the previous pleasure of experiencing. Honestly, even in the worst case scenario of not finding something to swap, one still ends up having the pleasure of exploring a wide selection of scents that may never have come across their radar otherwise. Fumerie's Tracy Tsefalas and André Gooren hosting the June 2016 Swap \n\nJB: Are all types of fragrances allowed? \nTT: Although we are open to a huge variety of fragrances, there are some basic guidelines: No counterfeit or \"copycat\" perfumes. No damaged items. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:32:10.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
