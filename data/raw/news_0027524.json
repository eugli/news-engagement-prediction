Frazier got hot.   \nGeorgia (14-11) trailed by as many as 14 in the second half against Tennessee (14-11) on Saturday but senior guard J.J. Frazier put the team on his back with 29 points and six assists in 39 minutes of play to lead the Bulldogs to a 76-75 win. The victory snaps a five-game SEC losing streak for the Bulldogs and a three-game streak overall. \nThe Volunteers led by two at halftime but jumped out to a big lead midway through the second period. UGA started to climb back in it with approximately 15 minutes left in the second half. That's when the Bulldogs began a 19-5 run with Frazier scoring 12 of those points in a span of seven minutes to tie the game at 58. \nThe largest lead the rest of the way was six points and held by Georgia with just over 2:26 left. What's more impressive about the win for the Bulldogs is that they were able to scrape back into the game without the services of leading scorer Yante Maten , who played only 16 seconds during that span because of foul trouble. With four fouls Maten entered the game briefly in the final six minutes but was only on the court for one offensive possession before being whistled for a questionable offensive foul. Not a member?

After getting his first start in Saturday's game Crump pitched in with 13 points, including a pair of second-half three-point shots that were instrumental in the comeback and a pair of free throws to help the Bulldogs hold on. Junior guard Juwan Parker also reached double digits with 11 points, four rebounds and three assists on the day and Derek Ogbeide had a game-high eight rebounds. \nTennessee came into Saturday's game as one of the first four teams in the NCAA Tournament according to ESPN Bracketologist Joe Lunardi after winning five out of its last six. The Volunteers are now 6-6 in the SEC while Georgia is 5-7. \nNext up for the Bulldogs is Mississippi State on Tuesday, February 14 at 9 p.m. ET. \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
