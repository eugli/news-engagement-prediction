We want our children to be safe, and of course this child needs help. He needs to be in the right care and if he is going to be at the school, he needs to be supervised at all times.\" \nCaroline said parents had a right to know if there was a sex offender among their children. \nThe school refused to comment to AAP. \nThe Department of Education said the accused boy was being \"constantly supervised\" by two staff members while at school. \n\"The school is doing everything reasonably possible to ensure the safety of all students,\" a spokesperson said.
