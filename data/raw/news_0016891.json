Was it a mischief done deliberately by or in collusion with EC?\" Kejriwal tweeted. \n\nThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader's remarks followed reports that more than 150 EVMs did not function properly in various assembly constituencies in Punjab on Saturday. \n\nVoting was stopped for over an hour at some polling stations due to the glitches. \n\nEven the VVPAT (voter verified paper audit trail) machines developed snags at several places.
