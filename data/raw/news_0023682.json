Read More \nLi, then aged 40, decapitated Mr Mclean and paraded his severed head to those watching outside. \nHe then proceeded to cut off bits of the victim's flesh and eat it. \nWhen police arrived, they found witnesses at the side of the road in tears, many having vomitted. \nFollowing a stand-off with armed police which lasted until the next morning, Li tried to escape and was captured after being Tasered twice. \nLi, a Chinese national who is now aged 48, was found not criminally responsible for the crime in 2009. \nPsychiatrists said he was suffering from untreated schizophrenia at the time. The horrific attack happened on board a Greyhound bus in front of horrified passengers (file image) (Photo: BusBud) \nHe spent seven years being treat in mental health facilities. \nLast year, Li was allowed to start living independently on the condition he continued to take medication and see professionals.
