Slot to Georgia Links \nGeorgia (15-11) inched a little closer to .500 in SEC play Tuesday evening with a 79-72 victory over Mississippi State (14-11) behind a strong second-half performance from J.J. Frazier and a big night from Yante Maten . The Bulldogs are now 6-7 in conference play. \nMSU led 32-28 at the break, but at that point Frazier had zero points. Before this one was over, he would have 17 to go with five rebounds and six assists. Maten had a game-high 24 points to go with nine rebounds, three blocks, and a pair of steals.

The three combined to shoot 27 free throws on the night and connected with 26. The team shot 28 from 32 from the charity stripe, good for 87.5 percent. \nGeorgia goes for its third-straight win on Saturday and it won't be easy. Kentucky comes to town with a 20-5 overall record and in a three-way tie atop the SEC with Florida and South Carolina at 10-2. Tip is set for 6 p.m. ET. \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
