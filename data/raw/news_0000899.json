Percival Fawcett, who spent his life searching for a mysterious city in the Amazon. View Images Official THE LOST CITY OF Z poster Courtesy of Amazon Studios & Bleecker Street \nWriter/director James Gray’s adventure epic, The Lost City of Z , follows British explorer Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) through his many voyages into the unknown jungles of the Amazon in the first part of the 20 th century. Leaving his wife, Nina (Sienna Miller), behind in England, Fawcett and his aide-de-camp, Henry Costin (Robert Pattinson), disappear into a world few Europeans had ever experienced to uncover a lost land no one anticipated. In adapting David Grann’s bestselling nonfiction book of the same name, Gray was fascinated by Fawcett’s unquenchable spirit of adventure and exploration. “Here was a person for whom the search meant everything,” explains Gray. “His dream of finding an ancient Amazonian civilization sustained him through unimaginable hardships, the skepticism of the scientific community, startling betrayals and years spent away from his family.” Fawcett’s numerous trips to the region unlocked endless secrets about the Amazon’s flora and fauna, as well as its geography and local populations. But it is what happened to him during his last expedition in 1925 alongside his son, Jack (played by Tom Holland), that remains perhaps his greatest mystery.

Today one can visit the Bolivian town of Cobija. But that modern metropolis is a far cry from the lawless outpost that greeted Fawcett after a grueling climb over a 17,000 foot-high Andean pass in 1906. One can even raft down the Rio Verde in the Mato Grosso area of Brazil. But it is nearly impossible to imagine how such a river trip felt at the turn of the century when every noise signaled the existence of a strange new creature, or perhaps something more ominous. When the Royal Geographical Society first approached Fawcett to survey the wilderness between Bolivia and Brazil, they pointed to a map of South America and said, “Look at this area. It’s full of blank spaces.” Fawcett’s desire to fill in those spaces underscores a unique emotional experience cherished by every adventurer, that ineffable moment when the unmapped and unknown world reveals itself.
