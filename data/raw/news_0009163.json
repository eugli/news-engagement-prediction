Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON — The biggest scrap in football won’t take place until Sunday evening but fighting broke out in downtown Houston on Saturday night, a full 24 hours before the National Football League season wraps up. \nThe Ultimate Fighting Championship came to town, setting up shop in the Toyota Center, just a few steps from the central city hub where the NFL experience has attracted a teeming swarm of football-themed tourists this week. \nIt may have been an inspired move. \n“I can’t afford to pay thousands of dollars for a Super Bowl ticket,” Ray Sorrell, a New England Patriots fan from Boston, told USA TODAY Sports. “I came down here hoping I’d get lucky and find something for $1,000, but that doesn’t look like it's happening.” \nInstead, Sorrell has attended the various fan festival activities and hung out near radio row, collecting autographs and occasionally persuading former players to stop for a photo or a quick chat. Despite being only a “casual” UFC fan, the $50 he paid for a seat on Saturday seemed like a bargain compared to everything else going on in Houston. \nMORE NFL: LaDainian Tomlinson headlines 2017 Pro Football Hall of Fame class \nUFC Fight Night 104 was not one of the organization’s signature pay-per-view events and was a little light on star power, yet the crowd was engaged and got a glimpse of some of the future stars of the company’s roster. Jessica Andrade, who will likely get a crack at the UFC women’s strawweight title before long, and hometown favorite Chas Skelly earned a rousing reception by forcing Chris Gruetzemacher to tap out. \nDon’t be surprised if this format is here to stay too. Marrying a UFC event with a place where a vast number of sports fans congregate on a specific weekend makes too much sense to ignore, and next year’s Super Bowl in Minneapolis offers another opportunity for a Saturday night special. \n“Up until tonight it has felt like the Super Bowl is the only show in town,” Houston fight fan Rich Saunders said. “This gives us something a bit different and the crowd is a real mix of people.” \nThere were a smattering of Patriots and Atlanta Falcons jerseys in the arena, a man in a Tom Brady mask hung out in the bleachers, and another briefly tried to get a Pats chant started up during a quiet early fight, before being silenced by a chorus of boos. \nBut the main noises were those of excitement, which must have pleased Dana White no end, and surely gives rise to future Super Bowl tie-ins. As the city began to burst at the seams with humanity, the UFC’s arrival became a fitting part of the festivities, even if it had nothing to do with football. \nPHOTOS: Super Bowl LI practices Facebook Posted!
