It is unpredictable and can happen to anyone, including teenagers. Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency and causes death sudden death if not treated immediately. Causes and risk factors \nCoronary artery disease, which often results in coronary ischemia and ventricular fibrillation (v-fib), is the leading cause of sudden cardiac arrest. \nCoronary ischemia, also called cardiac ischemia, is a medical term for not having enough blood through the coronary arteries. \nVentricular fibrillation is a life threatening abnormal condition that causes your heart to beat quickly and out of rhythm. \nRisk factors of sudden cardiac arrest are similar to those of coronary artery disease. These include - smoking, lack of physical exercise, obesity, diabetes, family history, a sedentary lifestyle, as well as drinking too much alcohol. Can you survive a cardiac arrest? \nCardiac arrest is reversible in most victims if it's treated within a few minutes. However, the chances of surviving an episode outside a hospital are poor. \nAs per a report in British Heart Foundation, ventricular fibrillation can sometimes be corrected by giving an electric shock through the chest wall, by using a device called a defibrillator. \nIf you encounter someone who has collapsed or is not breathing normally, experts suggest giving CPR immediately and continuing it until professional emergency medical services arrive.
