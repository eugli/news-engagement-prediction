Its relatively short and sweet run time of 1 hour 46 minutes brings it in almost a full hour shorter. \nThe upcoming film stars Dwayne Johnson, Vin Diesel, Charlize Theron, Kurt Russell, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, among others. It's scheduled for US and UK release on April 14, with no Australia release date yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:27:55.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
