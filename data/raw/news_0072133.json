Dozier DFP) 19 CONNECT 24 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nEAST LANSING – Jon Reschke is leaving Michigan State’s football program. \nThe rising senior linebacker, who sat out most of last year with an ankle injury , released a statement Friday afternoon that he will be seeking an immediate graduate transfer after he completes his degree at MSU. \nAn MSU spokesman confirmed that the Birmingham Brother Rice graduate no longer is part of the program. He is the second projected starter to leave the Spartans in the past month. Offensive lineman Thiyo Lukusa told the Free Press on Feb. 7 that he has quit football and no longer is enrolled at MSU. \nThe Spartans are scheduled to start spring practice Saturday. Three other unnamed players currently are suspended, along with a football staffer, while investigations continue into an alleged sexual assault that occurred in January. \nIn his statement, Reschke wrote: \n“Over a month ago, in an argument and a brief moment of anger, I lost control of my emotions and made an insensitive and totally regrettable comment involving a former teammate. In so doing, I have hurt and offended countless number of people, and for that, I am deeply sorry. If I could take my comment back, I would do so in a second. \n“I have addressed my teammates and coaches and while many understand my actions were totally uncharacteristic of who I am, the hurt still lingers. Therefore, after discussions with coach Dantonio and other members of the staff, we have mutually decided that I will complete my degree and seek the opportunity of a graduate transfer for my final year of football. \n“To the entire Spartan Nation, to all of my teammates past and present, to coach Dantonio and the entire coaching staff, to all the trainers, managers and administrators - I offer my sincere apology and I thank you for the greatest four years of my life. I will always cherish the friendships, the memories and the journey. There is no doubt in my mind that the Spartan Dawgs will rise up and again return to being one of the strongest programs in college football. \n“Forever Go Green, God Bless.” \nReschke played in just two games in 2016, finishing with 13 tackles, a forced fumble and an interception against Notre Dame and Wisconsin. He could have two years of college eligibility remaining if he seeks a medical redshirt due to injuries during his true freshman year as well. \nThe 6-foot-2, 227-pound outside linebacker played in 24 career games at MSU, including 14 during the Spartans’ Big Ten championship and College Football Playoff season in 2015. Reschke finished his MSU career with 101 tackles, 6.5 for lost yardage and two sacks. \nContact Chris Solari: . Follow him on Twitter @chrissolari .
