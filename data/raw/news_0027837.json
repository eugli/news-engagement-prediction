The stunt was immediately criticized by radio personality Bob Romanik , who went on air to call the rapper a “greasy black n son of a bitch.” The DJ now says he will issue an apology…if Waka agrees to his terms: stop using violent lyrics.\n“If he takes the violence out of his rap, I’ll never again call him a n , and I’ll apologize to him,” Romanik said in a video obtained by TMZ . “Until then, he is what he is.”\nRelated Radio Host Goes on Racist Rant in Response To Waka Flocka's Trump Jersey Ass-Wiping Watch Waka Flocka Use a Donald Trump Jersey to Wipe His Ass on Stage Waka Flocka Says His Mom, Not Gucci Mane, Deserves Credit for His Rap Career The fact that this dude is trying to negotiate an apology for making racist remarks is, well, insane. But he doesn’t stop there. Romanik later claims he’s not a racist—of course—but he doesn’t approve of Waka’s “disrespectful” behavior.\n“I don’t like that no good greasy son of a bitch […] that’s not hatred for the blacks, it’s hatred for him and his actions,” he says. “[Waka] can talk about killing people and killing cops and killing crackers, but I can’t?”\nIt’s a weak argument, which concludes with Romanik insisting he isn’t afraid to meet Waka face to face.\nShortly after the DJ’s rant went viral, Waka responded with his own video posted on TMZ . The 30-year-old artist called Romanik a “disgrace to white America” and said if the radio show didn’t get shut down, it’ll prove “how far racism goes in America.” He also sent out a warning.\n“I’m going to go up to his show. I’m going to find out how much he’s going to kill me when I touch back in the states. I’m going to show him what threats is like,” Waka said. “[…] I’m not going to call the cops. I’m going to his show and see if I can get a personal interview. Let me see if he talks that ra-ra shit when I pull up.”\n \nTags: News , Videos , DJ , Lyrics , Racism , Waka Flocka", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:31:06.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
