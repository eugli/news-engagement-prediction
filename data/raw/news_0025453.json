REUTERS Sergio Aguero was keen to get on the field following Jesus' injury PA Aguero was benched for a third successive game REUTERS Gabriel Jesus (left) injured his foot after 14 minutes REUTERS Bournemouth's Jack Wilshere also came off injured \nThe Cherries had their chances to get back into the game, while City should really have doubled their lead when Aguero smashed a volley wide of the mark from six yards. \nSane himself hit the crossbar late on as City waltzed around their hosts playing keep-ball. \nAnd they are not the only ones coming out of the game with an injury worry as Jack Wilshere, on loan at Bournemouth from Arsenal, came off before half time with an ankle problem after an ineffectual 45 minutes in the middle of the park.
