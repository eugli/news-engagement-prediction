(AGAIN) trying to crush #Brexit . You will not silence the voices of 17 million ppl. Clear enough? — Jan Bone (@JanJb66) February 26, 2017 \nTo which Mr Montgomerie said: “I don’t mind Parliament having the debate, but ultimately parliament should respect what people decided on 23rd June.” \nMs Miller’s comments come as Tory grandee Lord Heseltine said he would rebel against Theresa May over Brexit ensuring that Parliament had the final say on what he described as “the defining issue of our time.” @PortnStilton @Redpeter99 but #Gina Miller doesn't annoy me. Full of admiration. One brave and intelligent lady — Susan Bates Little (@SBLart) February 26, 2017 \nWriting in The Mail on Sunday he said Labour, Liberal Democrat and rebellious Tory colleagues ready to back a change to the Brexit Bill simply want to uphold the Supreme Court's ruling that MPs and peers have ultimate authority. \nHe wrote: \"In the end the outcome of Brexit will have to be confirmed by Parliament. Gina Miller: 'Defending democracy is the best way to spend my money' \n\"It will also have to pass in 27 national European parliaments, several sub-national parliaments and the European Parliament. \n\"It was perhaps unwise for our Government to suppose that our Parliament should be excluded where all others were included. Gina Miller, Blair, Clegg, Farron, Branson, Sugar, Mandelson, Patten holding up what the British people want deliver #Brexit & leave the #EU \n\"Very sensibly, after the Supreme Court interpreted the law, that position was reversed and Parliament was restored to its rightful constitutional role as the ultimate authority. \n\"I will vote in the House of Lords to ensure that position is legally intact.” Show your support for Gina Miller's new campaign to push for the necessary amendments to the A50 bill - https://t.co/1AEnSK661Q — Hipkiss (@HipkissArt) February 26, 2017 \nMs Miller's comments caused a furore online with social media users battling it out on Twitter. \nSome said they were \"full of admiration\" for Ms Miller with many describing her as \"brave\" and \"intellignet\". \nBut others were less sympathetic accusing her of trying to \"silence the voices of 17 million people.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:21:37.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
