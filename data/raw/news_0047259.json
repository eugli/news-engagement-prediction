But they’re certainly coming closer to that status, according to a new traffic study . \nREAD MORE: 4 Metro Vancouver roads make list of top 20 worst traffic bottlenecks in Canada \nINRIX, a Kirkland, Wash.-based company that provides traffic data and analytics, released its Global Traffic Scorecard for 2016 on Monday. \nIt found that Montrealers had it worse than any other Canadian city when it came to peak hours spent in congestion. \nMontreal drivers spent an average of 52 hours in congestion last year. Toronto commuters came second at just over 45 hours. TomTom ranks Metro Vancouver as the worst for traffic congestion in Canada \nCanadian cities didn’t exactly rank near the top of the world — that was Los Angeles, with 104 hours spent in congestion in peak time periods last year. \nIt was followed by Moscow (91 hours), New York (89 hours) and San Francisco (83 hours). \nBut Canadian cities are certainly climbing the charts. In 2015, Montreal ranked 60th of all cities when it came to hours spent in congestion. Last year, it was 23rd. \nConstruction is shown on the Turcot interchange in Montreal, Wednesday, October 12, 2016. THE CANADIAN PRESS IMAGES/Graham Hughes \nAt 14 per cent, Montreal’s average congestion rate topped all other cities in Canada and the U.S. \nThis rate was derived by taking the percentage of time spent on the road at various times of day and then dividing them to arrive at an average. \nThis included time spent on the road out of total travel during periods such as peak times on highways in and out of a city, peak periods inside the city, and travel at other times of day and on weekends. \nToronto is also making its way up the rankings. It ranked 53rd in the world last year, up from 84th in 2015. \nAfternoon traffic on highway 401 East and West bound in Toronto, Ont.

Toronto’s Highway 401, between Highway 427 and Yonge Street.
