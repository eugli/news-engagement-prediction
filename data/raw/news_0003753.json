Really, so excited. \nHe could hardly hold back the excitement in this promotional video from FAU. After all, these are exciting times. Commit to the Owls! Coach @Lane_Kiffin is bringing in the best recruits. Now we need the best fans! \n— FAU Football (@FAU_Football) January 27, 2017 \nBut seriously, why is Kiffin so miserable here? \nWhile Kiffin said “exciting” twice in this video, it looked like he was slowly dying inside. Or, he was possibly just trying to read with the sun in his eyes. After watching this I'm not 100% sure if Lane Kiffin isn't being held hostage at FAU pic.twitter.com/oS974EYl8O \n— Jack McGuire (@TailgateHeisman) January 31, 2017 \nIf the point of the video was to mobilize the FAU fanbase, Kiffin’s enthusiasm wasn’t necessarily at its best.
