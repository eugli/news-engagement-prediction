Set in New Jersey in 1987, the novel is a deeply autobiographical coming-of-age story about a computer-loving misfit named Billy, who dreams of being a video game designer and hopes to win a big contest with his questlike game, The Impossible Fortress. (Each chapter opens with a few lines of computer code Mr. Rekulak wrote, and the narrative is filled with nostalgic references to TV shows like “Magnum P.I.” and “Alf” and unfortunate ’80s fashion trends like parachute pants.) “I knew this was something I wasn’t going to be able to commission because it was just about me,” Mr. Rekulak said. Photo Some of Quirk’s biggest hits, from left: “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,” “Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children” and “William Shakespeare’s The Empire Striketh Back.” The novel started out as a series of journal entries. About six years ago, Mr. Rekulak’s father had a stroke, and he began going home to New Jersey each weekend to visit. He bought a notebook and started writing down stories from his childhood. Mr. Rekulak’s father, a former construction worker and furniture salesman, died four months later. Mr. Rekulak kept writing, with occasional long interruptions to work on Quirk projects. Eventually, he had the blueprint for a novel. He felt awkward about publishing it himself, he said. Instead, he pitched it to a literary agent, who sold it to Simon & Schuster in 2015, for a mid-six-figure sum. “I didn’t want to do it through Quirk because I didn’t want the people who report to me to have to go out and talk about how great the book was, because that would be the worst,” he said. Like his protagonist, when he was a boy Mr. Rekulak had spent hours creating rudimentary computer games in which players hunted for treasure and fought dragons. In college, he studied programming, then took a writing elective and realized he was in the wrong field. Photo Some of Quirk Books’ volumes, including “ Crafting With Cat Hair ,” at its offices.

After moving to Philadelphia to work at the Running Press, a small, independent publisher, he met David Borgenicht, who had just started Quirk Books and hired Mr. Rekulak as an editor. In 2002, the press started with a catalog that consisted of goofy novelty and gag collections, like a book of lyrics from cheesy 1970s and ’80s songs typeset as poetry and “Field Guide to Stains.” Eventually, the internet eroded that niche, as humor blogs and YouTube videos rendered one-note joke books pointless. (Quirk still acquires some weird kitschy books, including “ Crafting With Cat Hair ” and “Broetry,” which is exactly what it sounds like.) Mr. Rekulak wanted to expand into fiction. But it was hard to find novels that fit with the imprint’s offbeat brand. And since Quirk couldn’t offer big advances — the company typically pays them in the $15,000 range — few queries came in from agents or writers. It was easier to come up with the plots himself. His first idea was to take a public domain classic and splice it with science fiction or horror. He settled on “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,” a gory and irreverent Jane Austen mash-up, and assigned it to a young writer, Mr. Grahame-Smith, for a $5,000 advance. It went on to sell more than 1.8 million copies. Photo Four of the books anonymously written by Quirk publisher Jason Rekulak. “I get credited with creating the mash-up, but it was Jason’s idea,” Mr. Grahame-Smith said. “It was at once the best and dumbest idea I’ve ever heard in my life, and it came from Jason’s brain.” After sales for the book exploded, Mr. Rekulak commissioned a few others, including “Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters.” Other publishers quickly jumped on the trend, with books like “Jane Slayre” and “Wuthering Bites.” Almost overnight, Quirk established itself as an unorthodox hit factory. Quirk, which occupies a multistory office on a narrow cobblestone street in Philadelphia’s Old City, has 21 employees and publishes about 25 books a year. In his office, Mr. Rekulak has large framed posters for a few of the company’s biggest hits, taped up pieces of fan mail from young readers, and several bookshelves packed with Quirk titles and a few classics by Lovecraft and Thomas Hardy. A manila folder on the floor, labeled “Unicorns,” holds random ideas for books that Mr. Rekulak has collected and stashed away. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Several of Quirk’s most successful writers have left, wooed away by bigger publishers that offered large advances. Mr. Riggs, Mr. Grahame-Smith and Mr. Winters have all moved to major publishers and have had their books optioned for TV and film . Mr. Rekulak views those defections as the inescapable plight of a small publishing house, although sometimes it stings. But he is keeping the talent incubator running. In 2016, Quirk had its most profitable year. Mr. Rekulak is optimistic about a new flock of Quirk writers, including Ian Doescher , whose bizarre and brainy mash-up of Shakespeare and “Star Wars,” “William Shakespeare’s The Empire Striketh Back,” has sold more than 900,000 copies, and Fred Van Lente, a graphic novelist who wrote the forthcoming novel “Ten Dead Comedians,” which blends a classic Agatha Christie locked-room mystery with stand-up comedy. Mr. Van Lente wrote the novel after Mr. Rekulak approached him with the idea and a plot synopsis. “His ethos is, you don’t have to do it my way, but your way has to be better than mine,” Mr. Van Lente said. Mr. Rekulak has another Quirk book coming out later this year — an original picture book he wrote that is based on the sci-fi show “The X-Files,” which features the agents Mulder and Scully as kids. His name won’t be on the cover. A version of this article appears in print on February 6, 2017, on Page C5 of the New York edition with the headline: Master of the Quirky and the Offbeat.
