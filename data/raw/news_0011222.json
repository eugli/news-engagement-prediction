His work is being shown at the Circulations festival, Paris , to 5 March. All photographs: Jan Cieslikiewicz Cieslikiewicz has had an atypical route into photography – originally a champion swimmer, he moved to the United States to study mathematics at Harvard, before starting a career as a Wall Street trader ‘One day I took a grainy, out-of-focus picture of some street lamps at night with a cheap digital camera (or maybe of some windows – I don’t remember),’ he recalled in an interview with Lensculture . ‘Regardless, I had this immediate response to the image – I realised that the picture expressed all my longing for something undefined. And that was it for me. I’ve been engaged in photography ever since’ His series Null Hypothesis takes its name from a hypothesis posited across scientific disciplines, which asserts that the link between two phenomena is random – the goal of the researcher is to disprove the null hypothesis, and show that there is indeed a real, measurable link In the series, Cieslikiewicz shows a series of apparently unrelated scenes – the title hints at the difficulty, even impossibility, of proving a link between all of them He says his work aims to be ‘placeless’. ‘Null Hypothesis pushes this idea even further. I want it to look timeless and almost planet-less. I want the viewer to say “When, where, and what the hell is this?”’ In a statement accompanying the series, he seemingly turns his back on the certainties of mathematics: ‘From everyday events to the most fundamental questions, both on a personal and cosmic scale, we are surrounded by contradictions, unknowns, and change. Everything that seems to us as absolute will come to pass. History is full of dead truths, and people that fought for them. Religions, as timeless as they seem, have their beginning and will one day see an end. In science, basic concepts like time and space take on new meanings with each generation. Some things are just not to be resolved’ ‘I don’t think humanity as a whole can accept and genuinely come to terms with fundamental randomness and uncertainty,’ he says. ‘Accepting this view of reality means letting go of everything. That’s a pretty scary concept... given the vastness of our life experiences. But I think an imaginary world where we accept this idea as a given would be a better one. Fewer opinions would mean less conflict. Less attachment would mean less pain. Personally, I’ve accepted all these things rationally. Emotionally, with my heart: that’s a lot harder. But I’m working on it’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T09:25:42.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
