I love it when my trainer, Gunnar Peterson, kills my abs. The next day it even hurts to laugh. That's how I know I'm doing the exercises right!\" VIEW GALLERY Kendall Jenner revealed the workout she uses for toned abs \nThe 21-year-old recommended Instant Abs Trainer, a free app that has hundreds of different toning and strengthening moves that can be done anywhere – even in front of the TV. \"Sometimes when I'm watching TV, I think to myself, 'I should be doing crunches and sit ups right now.' Then I get off the couch and do it,\" Kendall said. \nSTORY: Kendall Jenner's dermatologist shares her skincare secrets \nA dedicated exercise routine is not the only thing Kendall uses to ensure she looks and feels her best. The model recently revealed the unusual way she controls cravings in a post on her app, titled \"The Story Behind my Pink Wall\". Kendall explained that she had painted a room in her home a specific shade of pink because it apparently has a calming effect – and suppresses your appetite. A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Dec 9, 2016 at 8:35am PST The model posted a room in her home pink to try and suppress her cravings \n\"I decided to paint it pink because while I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with the room, I went to dinner with friends and they had just gone to the 'Human Condition' exhibition at a former hospital in LA,\" Kendall wrote. \"They were telling me there's a pink room at the exhibit that had an explanation of the colour choice: Baker-Miller Pink is the only colour scientifically proven to calm you AND suppress your appetite. I was like, 'I NEED this colour in my house!' I then found someone to paint the room and now I'm loving it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:12:45.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
