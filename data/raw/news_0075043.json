Credit Badi Khlif/Reuters A public clash over the Syria conflict between the Trump administration and Russia was unfolding on Tuesday at the United Nations Security Council , where the United States delegation joined its European allies in seeking to punish the Syrian government for using chemical weapons. Russia signaled that it would veto a draft resolution imposing penalties on the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, in a vote set for later in the day. It would be the Kremlin’s seventh Security Council veto in defense of Mr. Assad in the Syria war, now nearly six years old. The draft resolution, proposed by Britain and France months ago and endorsed by the United States last week, would impose sanctions on a handful of Syrian military officials and entities for having dropped chlorine-filled barrel bombs on opposition-held areas on at least three occasions in 2014 and 2015, according to a United Nations panel. On Friday, Nikki R. Haley , the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said after a Security Council meeting on Syria that such attacks were “barbaric.” Chlorine is banned as a weapon under in international treaty that Mr. Assad’s government signed in 2013. “How much longer is Russia going to continue to babysit and make excuses for the Syrian regime?” Ms. Haley told reporters. \nAdvertisement   The arguments and vote over the resolution were important because they provided new insight into how President Trump, who has made clear his intent to improve ties with Russia, would deal with the Kremlin over the Syria war. Russia is Mr. Assad’s most important foreign ally.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:01:43.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
