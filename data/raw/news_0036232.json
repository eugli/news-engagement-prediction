There were independent promotions that were doing things right but it takes a while to come into place. \n“But it’s the hottest scene in the world, the talent is here and it is high on the agenda of myself and Ed, the president of Anthem Wrestling. Getty Images Jeff Jarrett is back at Impact wrestling and is determined to ‘make it great again’ WWE Jeff Jarrett says UK wrestling is ‘the hottest scene in the world’ right now WWE 12 Jeff Jarrett went on to enjoy worldwide fame throughout his wrestling career after breaking onto the scene with WWE in the 1990s \n“We’ve got our work cut out, but it’s exciting to re-energise and the UK is a top priority for us.” \nJarrett shot to worldwide fame during the 1990s after joining WWE, then named WWF, and was a six-time Intercontinental champion. \nHe went onto to become a four-time World Heavyweight champ at rivals WCW before launching the storied chapter of his career with TNA. \nFamed for bashing his opponents over the head with a guitar, Jarrett was and still remains one of the biggest names in wrestling. \nAnd although he says “never say never” when quizzed whether we will see his instrument-swinging antics in the ring again, these days he is more focused on unearthing the next big star. \nJarrett explained: “My family has been in the business for 70 years, so hearing the stories from a very young age, that’s part of the business. \n“I was a fan first, then I became a wrestler, then a promoter then a businessman and everything that goes with it – marketing, merchandise, licensing, legal, everything. But I’ve always enjoyed it. \n“Go back to 2002 when Impact was launched with a young guy from North Georgia AJ Styles and another from Toronto named Bobby Roode, then Samoa Joe came along, Eric Young… I could go on and on. \n“Those guys have gone on to be hot attractions and AJ is the hottest attraction. That’s something that I take a lot of pride in.” \nHe continued: “Being back with Impact wrestling, I couldn’t be happier for those guys, but from a professional and business side, it energises me so much to find the next AJ Styles, the next Bobby Roode, the next Samoa Joe. Getty Images AJ Styles enjoyed a fine career in TNA before moving on to join WWE in 2016 WWE 12 Styles has enjoyed a fine first year in WWE and had a long run as World Champion \n“And at Impact, that’s a big part of what we are doing. From the corporate side to the in-ring product, it’s a restructure, a reorganisation, and we want to make Impact great again.” \nDespite his keenness to help the next generation of wrestling stars in their creative angles, Jarrett’s experience in the business has given his the nous to know when to get involved and when to take a step back and let the individual go with it. \nAnd one man he is happy to do that with is current Impact wrestler Matt Hardy. \nAfter making his name as a high-flying daredevil in WWE, Hardy has reinvented himself over the last year in Impact, with his ‘Broken Brilliance’ storyline and his feud with brother Jeff being one of the most-talked about wrestling angles around the globe. \nJarrett said: “I prefer to call it match-making or booking, because Matt, Jeff and ‘Broken Brilliance’ – they are the creators of that. \n“You just have to put them in positions and let them run with it. I think that’s part of the magic of our business is that we don’t really write stories but document them. \n“Matt Hardy has reinvented himself in a unique way, and with Jeremy Borash and how it is edited, it is groundbreaking and it is revolutionising different story aspects.” \nHe continued: “When you look down in history, whether it was The Rock or Stone Cold, they are the perfect example that you can be given the ball, but you then have to run with it. \n“Matt was given the ball, and he ran with it. Rex Features Matt Hardy, right, and brother Jeff were praised for their excellent ‘Broken Brilliance’ storyline WWE John Cena has been a stalwart for the WWE over the past decade Reuters 12 Cena recently equalled Ric Flairs record when he won the world title for a 16th time \n“John Cena has been running with it for 15 years. John Cena is John Cena – it’s really not a character he is playing. \n“So you have to refine who you are as a professional wrestler and convey and connect that to the audience.” \nCompeting against the monster WWE is always a major problem for wrestling organisations, but Impact are attempting to do that in more one than one. \nIn December, Anthem Sports and Entertainment Corporation announced that they had launched the TNA Impact Wrestling app in the UK and Ireland – available for just £4.99 per month . \nAnd Jarrett insists that fans who purchase it will not be disappointed. \n“When you think about the body of work over the last 15 years, with the likes of AJ Styles having the majority of his career on there, and Samoa Joe, Kurt Angle, Christian Cage, Team 3D… I could go on and on. \n“There’s over 4,000 hours and that’s just the archive,” said Jarrett.
