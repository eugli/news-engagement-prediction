In a report last year, Amnesty found that more than 17,000 people have died of torture and ill-treatment in custody across Syria since 2011, an average rate of more than 300 deaths a month. \nThose figures are comparable to battlefield deaths in Aleppo , one of the fiercest war zones in Syria, where 21,000 were killed across the province since 2011. \n“The horrors depicted in this report reveal a hidden, monstrous campaign, authorized at the highest levels of the Syrian government, aimed at crushing any form of dissent within the Syrian population,” Maalouf said. \nWhile the most recent data is from 2015, Maalouf said there is no reason to believe the practice has stopped since then, with thousands more probably killed. \n“These executions take place after a sham trial that lasts over a minute or two minutes, but they are authorized by the highest levels of authority,” including the Grand Mufti, a top religious authority in Syria, and the defense minister, she said. \nREAD MORE: 7-year-old refugee who chronicled Aleppo horrors asks Donald Trump to ‘save the children’ \nSyrian government officials rarely comment on allegations of torture and mass killings. In the past, they have denied reports of massacres documented by international human rights groups, describing them as propaganda. \nThe chilling accounts in Tuesday’s report came from interviews with 31 former detainees and over 50 other officials and experts, including former guards and judges. \nAccording to the findings, detainees were told they would be transferred to civilian detention centers but were taken instead to another building in the facility and hanged. \n“They walked in the ‘train,’ so they had their heads down and were trying to catch the shirt of the person in front of them. The first time I saw them, I was horrified. They were being taken to the slaughterhouse,” Hamid, a former detainee, told Amnesty. \nAnother former detainee, Omar Alshogre, told The Associated Press the guards would come to his cell, sometimes three times a week, and call out detainees by name. \nAlshogre said a torture session would begin before midnight in nearby chambers that he could hear. \n“Then the sound would stop, and we would hear a big vehicle come and take them away,” said Alshogre, who spent nine months in Saydnaya. Now 21, he lives in Sweden. \nSpeaking in an interview from Stockholm via Skype, Alshogre described how he was forced to keep his eyes closed and his back to the guards while they abused or suffocated a cellmate. \nWATCH: Latest news on Syrian refugees in Canada Lethbridge Family Services reflects on Syrian Immigration ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:06:57.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
