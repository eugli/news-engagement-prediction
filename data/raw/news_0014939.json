By downloading a rail operator's app, commuters can scan through the barriers using Bluetooth technology on their phones. \nAccording to the company, contactless payment will be trialled on the Chiltern Railways route between London Marylebone and Oxford Parkway over the coming months. \nChiltern Railways will trial phone-operated ticket barriers on some train journeys this year. Tom Page/Flickr \nIn an online statement, RDG said that the app and software, which is currently in development, \"could eventually give way to biometric technology – such as fingerprint or iris scanning – allowing customers to be automatically identified and charged against their travel account.\" \nRDG's biometric plans are part of more than 200 technology projects aimed at making our railways more efficient. \nPaul Plummer, CEO of RDG, told the Press Association that the plans came after noticing the national rail network is “increasingly full.\" \nAs passwords and PIN numbers are slowly becoming obsolete due to growing digital fraud, concerns over data privacy, and difficulty in remembering the number and letter combinations of each individual code, more and more tech firms are looking into new ways of verifying identity which could make digital payments safer . \nBiometric technology, which can include fingerprint scans, voice verification, or retina and vein scans, are steadily gaining popularity for unlocking smartphones or accessing sensitive apps on smartphones. Using these methods for payment technology can make a customer's data more secure without inconveniencing them. \nA study by Experian found that fingerprint scanning and retinal scanning are the methods UK consumers feel most comfortable using to access their online accounts . \nPlummer said that the blueprint demonstrates \"how we can harness digital technology to make journeys better for passengers and freight customers on a railway that’s simpler and easier to use.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T13:40:44.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
