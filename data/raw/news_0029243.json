They were unaware that three pipe bombs had been planted with the intent to kill or maim first responders and surviving victims. They also didn’t know the perpetrators were now on the run. Part 2: The Big Break “We got a couple bleeding out,” squawked a male voice on never-before-heard radio recordings from the probation department, which ABC News obtained. “We need to get them out of here right now.” As the rescue operation began in earnest, officers were questioning victims about what they may know. “We had one person who was in the room who was actually a county employee that had recognized that our suspect had left this training holiday get together for country employees,” recalled San Bernardino Police Department Chief Jarrod Burguan. “That one person, when he was being extracted out of the room – had given the officer a name,” the chief said. “He gave us the name Syed Farook.” Farook had left minutes before the rampage appearing irritated, after spending time that morning with his coworkers – including his partner, Amanda Gaspard.

Back at the police station, veteran analyst Daani-Ruth Svonkin began searching databases for any information on Farook. Initially, the databases returned a confusing array of addresses. Svonkin dispatched officers to each location. As fears mounted that the perpetrators might preparing to mount another attack, 911 dispatchers received a call that would be the turning point. Computer programmer Stewart Boden had been on his way home when a black SUV made an abrupt lane change in front of him. “There was such a sudden abrupt move that I was thinking, ‘hmm this is a little unusual for a vehicle coming from Utah,’” he told ABC News. “I think I need to commit that license plate to memory,” he thought. Upon arriving home, Boden flicked on his television where news programs were reporting that police were searching for a black SUV. Previously unaware that a search was on for the vehicle, he immediately dialed 911. “About 20, 25 minutes ago, and I didn’t know anything about any SUV at that time,” he is heard in 911 recordings obtained by ABC News. “And it was a black SUV?” the dispatcher is heard saying. “Yeah, and uh I do have a good memory—“ “Ok.” “Utah license plate. X523RY.” Little did he know, Boden had just provided the crucial evidence that would crack the case. “You talk about getting a break in an investigation,” Burguan said. “That’s about as big as it gets right there.” Back at police headquarters, Svonkin took the new data and set to work. Running it through a database, she realized it was a rental car from Enterprise. She immediately phoned a contact she had developed at the company’s corporate headquarters, who said he would skip the standard procedures and get her as much information as he could. The call “seriously cut through some red tape,” she said. The normal process would have taken more time than they had. When the contact phoned back, he had a name: Syed Farook. “My hands started to shake at that point, and I thought ‘We really don’t have just a person of interest. We actually now have a suspect.” The new information allowed her to use a different database which provided her with a “singularly different and unique address that I did not locate anywhere else,” she said. She also began the process of pinging Farook’s cellphone – available from his employment contract – in an attempt to locate his last known location. With the new information in hand, she dispatched undercover officers. “I’m sending them to some place that could potentially be very, very dangerous for them. It was a very scary moment,” she recalled fighting back tears almost one year later, explaining her anxiety over that dispatch. “To know that, yes I found a legitimate address, a good address – but what was next? What was around the corner?” Within 35 seconds of arriving at the scene, Svonkin said, a black SUV pulled in front of one of the officers. Could those be the shooters they were hunting? Part 3: The Shootout “Had we been several seconds later, we probably would have missed him,” said Sgt. Gary Shuelke, who lead the team of undercover officers in unmarked cars. Falling into formation, Undercover Officer Nick Koahou tailed Shuelke’s vehicle in an unmarked van. After a few moments the officers realized they appeared to be heading to the Inland Regional Center – the site of the shooting. Officials now believe the pair wanted to get close enough to remotely detonate the pipe bombs they had left behind. Before they could get there, two marked squad cars pulled into the convoy, and began “rolling code” – or chasing with lights and sirens. Previously on non-scannable frequencies, the officers went live on the regular police radio channels. The Commanders’ Anxiety At the command post, Burguan was sitting at a table with San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon and David Bowdich, then the FBI’s top agent in southern California. The trio had been dividing up the workload for the investigation when the radio traffic roared to life. “It looks like they’re putting vests on inside,” radioed Sgt. Andy Capps, of the Redlands Police Department, who was just behind the black SUV. “Copy, copy, passing things around inside the vehicle,” replied the dispatcher, in the 911 calls ABC News obtained. Then the gunfire rang out. “Shots fired. Shots fired.” “They’re firing at, uh, law enforcement.” “Copy, suspects firing at law enforcement.” The Heroes of San Bernardino", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:41:39.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
