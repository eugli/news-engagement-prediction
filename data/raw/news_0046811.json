Each day, children and adults would enter the blank space and pepper the walls, furniture and floors with the rainbow adhesives, turning the stark exhibition a speckled wonderland. See more of the Obliteration Room here. Image: AP Photo/dapd, Torsten Silz In \"KUSAMA TRIX,\" the artist filled a room with large balloons bearing her signature symbol -- the dot -- surrounded by mirrored walls, flashing lights and a curious hallway of convex reflective surfaces and chandeliers. Essentially, an art lover's playhouse, staged at the Morio Art Museum in Tokyo. Image: Photo by Junko Kimura/Getty Images An extension of the \"KUSAMA TRIX\" exhibition, how could you not love these polka-dot creatures? Image: AP Photo/Yayoi Kusama Studio Inc. Lucky visitors to the Hudson River park in New York were blessed with the opportunity to relax on the Japanese artist's sculptures, titled \"Guidepost to the New Space,\" on the lawn at Pier 45. Image: AP Photo/Mary Altaffer This particular objet d'art was part of a Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong, where the yellow and black squash was set for the auction block alongside other works of contemporary Asian art. How much would you pay to get your hands of this psychedelic gourd? Image: AP Photo/Vincent Yu Kusama brought her polka-dotted madness to the stores of Louis Vuitton, collaborating with creative director Marc Jacobs on a line of bags, sunglasses, shoes and coats. What do you think of the lifelike mannequin of Kusama? What could possibly make northern France more beautiful than it already is? How about this Kusama installation, entitled \"Tulipes de Shangri-La,\" (The Tulips of Shangri-La) which was exhibited as part of the 'Lille fantastic' festival and the Lille3000, a cultural program promoted by the city.

Another bonanza of vinyl dots and balloons, aptly titled \"Dots Obsession - New Century, 2000,\" shown at the Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery in Sydney, 2002. The work was described as \"a maniacal imposition of colour, shape and pattern.\" Image: Photo credit should read TORSTEN BLACKWOOD/AFP/Getty Images A 14-room Yayoi Kusama retrospective made its way to New York last year, a mix of old photographs depicting the artist's life and immersive environments filled with the avant-garde's signature spots.
