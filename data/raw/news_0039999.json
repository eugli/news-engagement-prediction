Editor Advertisement \nRead in the news today that the restaurant chain Nando's have been hiring over 240 former inmates since 2012. This was the year the restaurant started working with Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (Score). \nThe company should be roundly applauded for doing their part in giving second chances to these group of people. We often see advertisements shouting at us to give them a second chance. We all agree that they should be given a second chance in life. But how many of us actually act on this? How often you go for a job interview, and you have to declare if you had ever served time in a Prison. You know that when you put \"Yes\" to that question, you will definitely be viewed differently. Maybe, this is the difference between you getting that job or being told your application was unsuccessful. \nSo, congrats on the great job done by Nando's. If only we see more of such companies in Singapore. \nJames Hong \nA.S.S.
