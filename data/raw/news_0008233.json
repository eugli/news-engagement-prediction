[], "text": "comments None of the Premier League's big six moved on deadline day but those below certainly did, from Crystal Palace to Leicester and Middlesbrough to Hull. As well as the usual suspects, a few lesser-known players joined the top flight as the January transfer window came to a close on Tuesday. Here, Sportsmail goes through every club's deadline-day activity, and gives you the low down on who got who. BURNLEY Ashley Westwood from Aston Villa, £5m, three-and-a-half-year deal Westwood is no newbie to the Premier League. He spent four seasons with Aston Villa in the land of untold riches and is back with Burnley. The 26-year-old midfielder was a long-term target of Sean Dyche's. Robbie Brady from Norwich City, £13m, three-and-a-half-year deal Another who knows the Premier League well after playing for Hull and Norwich. Brady cost Burnley £13m on deadline day ‒ a club record fee. The 25-year-old left-back is a Republic of Ireland international with 31 caps and seven goals. Burnley confirmed the signing of midfielder Ashley Westwood from Aston Villa on Tuesday Robbie Brady signed for Burnley from Norwich for £13m on January's deadline day CRYSTAL PALACE Mamadou Sakho from Liverpool, £2m loan for rest of the season Sakho needs no introduction. He joined Palace for an initial £2m loan fee ‒ plus his salary ‒ in the 11th-hour on deadline day. The France international, 26, had not played for Liverpool since serving a suspension after failing a drugs test in April. Luka Milivojevic from Olympiacos, £12.5m, three-and-a-half-year deal Milivojevic joined on deadline day and is a goalscoring Serbian. The 25-year-old midfielder had scored six goals this season for Olympiacos in Greece and previously played for Anderlecht in Belgium and Red Star Belgrade in Serbia. Mamadou Sakho posted a photo of himself with a Crystal Palace shirt on his Twitter profile Luka Milivojevic was unveiled for Crystal Palace after joining from Olympiacos HULL Andrea Ranocchia from Inter Milan, loan for rest of season Ranocchia signed a six-month loan deal and has 21 caps for Italy. The 28-year-old centre back has appeared over 150 times for Inter Milan and will provide cover for the injured Curtis Davies. He had fallen out of favour under Inter boss Stefano Pioli. Alfred N'Diaye from Villarreal, loan for rest of season N'Diaye joined on loan from Villarreal and it was announced in the final hour of deadline day. The 26-year-old defensive midfielder found first-team opportunities limited at Villarreal this season and has eight caps for Senegal. Kamil Grosicki from Rennes, £7m, three-and-a-half-year deal Grosicki was announced more than an hour after the window shut. The 28-year-old winger has been linked with Burnley and Everton previously. He is a well-experienced Poland international with 48 caps and nine goals. Hull confirmed the deal for Inter Milan defender Andrea Ranocchia on a six-month loan deal Kamil Grosicki signed for Hull from Rennes for £7m on a three-and-a-half-year deal LEICESTER Molla Wague from Udinese, loan for rest of season Claudio Ranieri wanted defensive reinforcements and pinpointed Wague with an option to buy after the loan. The Mali international was at the Africa Cup of Nations and the 25-year-old defender is available for Champions League football. Leicester completed their loan deal for Molla Wague with an option to buy the defender MIDDLESBROUGH Adlene Guedioura from Watford, £3m, two-and-a-half-year deal Plenty of Premier League football on Guedioura's CV. Middlesbrough beat Hull to the £3m signing of the Algeria midfielder, who has played for Wolves, Crystal Palace and Watford. The 31-year-old's powerful shots earned him the nickname Rocket Factory. Will he bring goals to their midfield, though? That remains to be seen. Adlene Guedioura has signed for Middlesbrough from Watford in a £3m deal SOUTHAMPTON Mouez Hassen from Nice, loan for rest of season Hassen was reunited with Claude Puel on deadline day as he signed on loan from Nice. The 21-year-old, who has yet to appear for France's senior side, becomes Southampton's fifth goalkeeper (Fraser Forster, Alex McCarthy, Harry Lewis and Stuart Taylor are the others). It remains to be seen what role he will play. Manolo Gabbiadini from Napoli, £17m, four-and-a-half-year deal Gabbiadini is new to the Premier League and the January window's second-most expensive signing (after Morgan Schneiderlin to Everton for £20m). The 25-year-old Italian will add to Puel's options up front. He can be used as a striker or winger. Mouez Hassen signed for Southampton on loan from Nice until the end of the season Manolo Gabbiadini joined Southampton from Napoli for £17m on deadline day SWANSEA Jordan Ayew from Aston Villa, player-plus-£5m, three-and-a-half-year deal Another who we know following his time with Aston Villa. The 25-year-old forward joined with Swansea's Neil Taylor going to Villa in a swap. Ayew is currently on Ghana duty at the African Cup of Nations in Gabon. Jordan Ayew signed for Swansea on deadline day in a player-plus-cash deal WEST BROM Marc Wilson from Bournemouth, loan for rest of season Wilson failed to appear in the Premier League for Eddie Howe's Bournemouth after signing from Stoke in August. The Republic of Ireland international, 29, wanted to leave for personal reasons. Tony Pulis signed Wilson at Stoke in 2010.
