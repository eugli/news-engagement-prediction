The claim, in a communiqué from the Islamic State, immediately revived fears about foreign fighters who have moved to Syria or Iraq to join the group’s ranks. But in Britain, it prompted even more troubling allegations. Several British news organizations — including the BBC, The Times of London and The Guardian — reported Tuesday evening that the man had been captured in Afghanistan; detained by the United States in the military prison at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba, from 2002 to 2004; and released to Britain, where the government awarded him 1 million pounds, about $1.25 million at current exchange rates, to settle a lawsuit he brought against the government. The Times of London said a brother of the man, Leon Jameson, had confirmed his identity based on a photograph distributed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. “It is him, I can tell by his smile,” Mr. Jameson was quoted as saying. “If it is true, then I’ve lost a brother.” However, neither American nor British officials could say for certain that the militant was the same man as Jamal Malik al-Harith , the man who had been held at Guantánamo. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The British government also said it could not confirm the Islamic State’s communiqué nor the reports in the British news media. “As all U.K. consular services are suspended in Syria and greatly limited in Iraq, it is extremely difficult to confirm the whereabouts and status of British nationals in these areas,” the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in a statement. American records show that a British man named Jamal Malik al-Harith was held at Guantánamo from 2002 to 2004. But no records suggest that anyone named Ronald Fiddler, reported to be the man’s birth name, or Abu Zakariya al-Britani, a nom de guerre, was held at Guantánamo. According to Defense Department documents, Mr. Harith was born in 1966 in Manchester, England. He was detained by the Taliban while driving in Pakistan, and he was then held by the Taliban in Kandahar, Afghanistan, where he was detained by American forces in October 2001. He was transferred to Guantánamo Bay in February 2002. That September, Maj. Gen. Michael E. Dunlavey, who was in charge of intelligence operations at Guantánamo, recommended that Mr. Harith be approved for release or transfer, based on an assessment that he “was not affiliated with Al Qaeda or a Taliban leader.” Photo A man known as Abu Zakariya al-Britani in a picture released by Islamic State militants. Nonetheless, Pentagon officials had their doubts about the man. They noted that he had traveled extensively in the Middle East from 1992 to 1996, and that he had joined a Qaeda operative who went to Sudan in 1992 at the same time that Osama bin Laden was active there. The recommendation that he be released was overruled by Maj. Gen. Geoffrey D. Miller, the commander of the Guantánamo operation from November 2002 to March 2004. However, the case of Mr. Harith and several other British citizens held at Guantánamo became divisive, and the government — then led by Prime Minister Tony Blair, who supported President George W. Bush’s decision to go to war with Iraq — helped secure the release of the Britons. On Wednesday, Alex Carlile , a lawyer and member of the House of Lords who served as an independent reviewer of terrorism legislation in Britain from 2001 to 2011, explained the reasons for a financial settlement with Mr. Fiddler.
