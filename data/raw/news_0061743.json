Look, I'm not mad about it, but it can't take this long to write a script, right?! Besides, third time's the charm!\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below To keep your hopes up, or maybe to dash them actually, because it's clear this isn't actually being taken all that seriously, here are 26 times SATC 3 has been hinted at by the cast and crew.\n1. I'm always hopeful and I always believe there's another story to tell because these are these women's lives so why wouldn't there be another chapter ... [But] I don't know if it will happen.

I know there is. ‚Äî Sarah Jessica Parker, Los Angeles Times , February 2011\n3. Well, it‚Äôs not really in my hands ... but what do I know? I‚Äôm always pleasantly surprised if they do one, and I‚Äôm not disappointed if they don‚Äôt. ‚Äî Chris \"Mr. Big\" Noth, Parade , June 2011\n4. I know what the story is. It‚Äôs a small story, but I think it should be told. The question is, what‚Äôs the right time to tell it? ‚Äî Sarah Jessica Parker, Parade , August 2011\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below 5. I‚Äôm still [Stanford] if they decide to make another movie. Every time I think it is over, the phone rings again. I think it is great that people want more of these characters since we are basically in wheelchairs at this point. ‚ÄîWillie Garson (Stanford Blatch, Carrie‚Äôs BFF), The Huffington Post , April 2012\n6. I would want to do it. I'm on record ... I feel like it's the gift that keeps on giving. Our fans are beautiful and loyal and talk to me wherever I go, and in whatever country I'm in, and that means a lot to all of us. So if the situation arose where we had a script and everyone loved it, and the studio wanted to make it, I think that it would be fantastic and I hope it happens but I have no idea if it will happen.

People talk about it amongst the people who are the players, but I don‚Äôt know if it will come together. It would be very exciting if it did. ‚Äî Kristin Davis, Haute Living , December 2013\n8. I feel the most important thing is always, do we have something left to say ... I think it's about the story, if there's something more to say ... [but] I'm not a writer and I don't work in a studio. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below ‚Äî Kim Cattrall, Entertainment Tonight , January 2014\n9. Sarah Jessica and I both know what that final chapter is. That doesn‚Äôt mean it will or should be told, but I do think there‚Äôs one story left. Whether it ever happens is a whole other situation ... But there‚Äôs four girls, and those girls are still in my mind. ‚Äî Executive producer Michael Patrick King, Entertainment Weekly , February 2014\n10. If Michael Patrick King is writing the sequel, and Sarah Jessica Parker is starring in it, sure! ‚Äî Cynthia Nixon, InStyle , February 2014\nNote: speaking on a potential third movie in 2012, Nixon told The Hollywood Reporter , \"I think it's fine to let it go.\" Good to know she changed her tune.\n11. We‚Äôve never really had real conversation about it, other than that I know there is a story. I think it‚Äôs a really lovely, wonderful story, but whether or not we tell it remains to be seen.

And as far as Sex and the City goes, the mere fact that it is still so alive, and not just on the gym TV ... but that people are still wondering about these girls, you never know. It could come back at some point. All bets are off. ‚Äî Michael Patrick King, Entertainment Tonight , November 2014\n16. In all the cases in the previous of two films there was long periods of rumors and speculation and then they happened ... I think it would be a really wonderful reunion. All four of us are so busy and doing our own projects, having children and god knows what else but when we do get together it feels like no time has passed and we‚Äôve always had that great chemistry. ‚Äî Kim Cattrall, Grazia , December 2014\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below 17. I know ‚Äî and Michael Patrick [King] knows well ‚Äî the story we might tell, if we ever tell it. But the real truth, and I'm not being cagey, is we've never discussed a when ... Everybody reads and projects so much into what I say. ‚Äî Sarah Jessica Parker, Today , September 2015\n18. It would be a challenge to do a third installment ... [but] It could be fun though. To say goodbye completely to Samantha would be pretty hard. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below ‚Äî Kim Cattrall, The Daily Record , June 2016\n19. I do think they should make another Sex and the City movie ... Not that I would be in it. I think that Aidan‚Äôs also moved on ... These girls still look great, there‚Äôs still stories to tell. What‚Äôs the hurdle, what‚Äôs the challenge? Just make another one. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below ‚ÄîJohn \"Aiden\" Corbett, The Huffington Post , August 2016\n20. I don't think any of us have said no. I think that remains an open question and discussion that will continue until it's been resolved ... I think that's always a possibility, definitely. ‚ÄîSarah Jessica Parker, Press Association , September 2016\n21. I‚Äôm not able to put it into percentages. There‚Äôs this old-fashioned thing called a warming drawer, and it keeps the plates warm, so that when you serve the main course, the food stays warm, so I have been saying it‚Äôs in the warming drawer. ‚Äî Sarah Jessica Parker, Watch What Happens Live , October 2016\n22. [ SATC 3 ] rests in the butler‚Äôs pantry. It‚Äôs not on the table, but somebody is holding it fairly nearby. ‚ÄîSarah Jessica Parker, CBS , October 2016\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below 23. I do feel inside like we‚Äôre not finished. I do feel like there‚Äôs another story ‚Ä¶ I would be up for anything Sarah Jessica Parker and Michael Patrick King think is the right thing. ‚Äî Kristin Davis, People , December 2016\n24. I think everyone, myself included, gets caught up in the excitement of going further, but what is the story? The reality of what [a third movie] would be ‚Äî there's nothing concrete. There's no script, there's no idea. It doesn't mean it's not going to happen, but what would it be? I'm not saying [a third Sex and the City ] doesn't exist or we can't do it, I'm saying, what is it?‚Äù Advertisement - Continue Reading Below ‚Äî Kim Cattrall, Entertainment Tonight , January 2017\n25. The truth of the matter is there is no script. There's never been a script ... the idea remains a real possibility but when is the right time? I guess that's what it all boils down to ‚Äî when! So we'll see. ‚Äî Sarah Jessica Parker, E! , January 2017\n26. It's in a warming drawer. It's never been a 'no' ... it's always been an 'if' and 'when.' And that remains the question being asked by two very thoughtful people who are taking into very serious consideration those people who devoted a lot of time. We're not cavalier about the way we arrive at that decision. ‚Äî Sarah Jessica Parker, Marie Claire , February 2017\nClearly, the only way forward is to crowdsource the script ourselves. I'll start: the movie starts ... and Samantha is a nun.
