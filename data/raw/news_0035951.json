Sepulveda Boulevard. \nThe victim was described as a 55-year-old male. \nThe man was transported to the hospital in serious condition. He was declared dead at the hospital. \nThe LAFD said in a four-hour time-period (between noon and 4 p.m.) they responded to nearly 150 downed power line calls. \nReporting from the scene for KCAL 9 News at 8 p.m., Rachel Kim said a large tree came down and hit the power lines which landed in the street. \nThe man, originally thought to be a motorist, was apparently walking in the area when he either engaged with the power line or water that had become electrified. \nThe man’s identity has not been revealed pending notification of his next of kin. \nAuthorities want to remind the public to steer clear of any downed wires. They added, “Never go near or touch anything or anyone that has come in contact with an electrical wire.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T10:23:02.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
