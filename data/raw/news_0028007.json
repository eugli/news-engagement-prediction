Draxler doubles it for PSG 0:52 \nLUIS ENRIQUE’S TETCHY POST-GAME INTERVIEW \nBarcelona boss Luis Enrique has defended himself in a tetchy post-game interview following his side’s 4-0 loss to PSG. \nHaving been questioned by a journalist from Catalan station TV3 about his failure to turn things around on the sideline, Enrique hit back. \n“It seems you don’t watch the game very well, because we changed from 4-3-3 to 4-5-1 during the game,” Enrique said. “But regardless, we could have done it perfectly, and you would have said the same \n“I’d like the same kind of treatment when we win, and the same personal treatment from yourself – I’d like you to maintain your line of questioning when we win, OK?” Di Maria rips PSG free 0:53 \n‘MEN AGAINST BOYS’ – GERRARD \nLionel Messi’s performance came under fire from Rio Ferdinand, while Steven Gerrard has praised the performance of PSG. \nHaving lost the ball, Messi’s “dejected” reaction summed up his horror show, according to the former Manchester United captain. \n“His reaction there was poor,” Ferdinand told BT Sport. “All night he was sloppy. \n“He looked dejected and bereft of ideas. He was popping up in positions you don’t usually see him and he was losing the ball – but he’s human.” \nGerrard chose to highlight how well the home side played against one of the best teams in the world. Barcelona's Lionel Messi. Source: AFP \n“They exploited Barcelona’s weaknesses all night long and it could have been six or seven,” Gerrard said. \nGerrard added: “[Messi] wasn’t alone. There were many more Barcelona players who showed zero effort, especially when they lost the ball, you can tell a team and an individual reaction. \n“There was just no reaction all night from any of them.” \nREASON FOR AUBAMEYANG SUB \nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang was hooked in Borussia Dortmund’s loss to Benfica, having missed a golden opportunity in the second half. \nStepping up to take his side’s penalty, Aubameyang fired straight down the middle and straight at the Benfica goalkeeper. \nSoon after he was subbed off, with coach Thomas Tuchel explaining the reason. \n“Aubameyang is not fully fit after the African Nations Cup,” Tuchel said via UEFA.com. “His body language did not suggest that he would do better after [missing] the penalty.” Aubameyang's atrocious outing \nSERGIO RAMOS TROLLS BITTER RIVALS \nReal Madrid’s Sergio Ramos is considering changing shirt numbers … from 4 to 93! \nIt might sound bizarre, but there is actually a brilliant motivation behind the suggestion, which includes trolling city rivals Atletico Madrid. \nHaving made over 500 appearances in the number 4 jersey of Real Madrid, Ramos would consider changing to 93 to honour his 93rd minute goal in the 2014 Champions League final. \nWith the final played against Atletico, that crucial strike levelled the scores with literally the final touch of the match and sent the UCL final into extra time, which Real Madrid won to seal ‘La Decima’. \n“Believe me when I say that the thought of changing my jersey number to 93 has crossed my mind,” Ramos said. “At the same time, the No 4 is one that I have always liked and that I have worn throughout all of my time at Real Madrid. It has nearly always brought me good luck. \n“But do not rule out seeing me change my number in my final season, as a tribute to what is such a great minute for us. \n“La Decima goal stands out above the rest of my goals, given how long we had been waiting to win the Champions League, with it coming in the last minute and because it helped us to go on and become champions.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
