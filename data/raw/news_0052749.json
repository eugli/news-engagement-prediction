Vogel \nPerez's team announced last week he had secured 180 pledged votes, just 44 votes short of the amount needed to win a majority. In response, Ellison accused his rival of trying to \"exert pressure” on DNC members. But the Minnesota has not released his own vote count, making it unclear how much pledged support he can point to. \nStill, Ellison boasts a long roster of prominent supporters and major labor groups, and recently added a key late endorsement from New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley, a well-known party veteran who currently leads the Association of State Democratic Chairs. \nLabor Secretary Tom Perez is considered a slight favorite to win election as the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee among party officials. | Getty \nFrom the beginning of the race, Ellison has sought to position himself as the unity candidate and quickly picked up support from top Democrats in both the progressive and establishment-oriented wings of the party. Perez, who joined the race after it was well underway, has since won some of the most coveted endorsements in the race from former administration officials including Joe Biden and former Attorney General Eric Holder. \n\"I think Tom's campaign — I think they're pretty confident at the end of the day but they believed that this was always going to go to Atlanta,\" said Maria Cardona, a voting member backing Perez. \"Tom has done a pretty good job of cementing a topnotch campaign given the timing of when he got in but he remains very aware that this is not his for the taking and I think that's smart of him to think that.\" \nWhile he trailed far behind Ellison and Perez in the survey, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has gotten traction recently in his own bid for the chairmanship. On Wednesday, former Vermont Governor and DNC Chair Howard Dean announced his support for Buttigieg, joining several other former DNC chairs — including Steve Grossman, Ed Rendell and Joe Andrews — who are backing the 35-year-old Indiana mayor. By Edward-Isaac Dovere \n“Of the many challenges we face, the most important key to our future success is to cement the loyalties of the age group that has voted for us in the greatest numbers in every presidential election since 2008. They vote Democratic, but they do not consider themselves Democrats,” Dean wrote in a statement sent to DNC members. “If we fail to bring this generation into electoral politics now, the DNC will become irrelevant. This is our last chance...Our future is now if Pete is our chair.” \nBetween Buttigieg and the other top contenders — South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison, Idaho Democratic Party Executive Director Sally Boynton Brown, and Democratic strategist Jehmu Greene — many DNC members expect the vote will go beyond a first ballot Saturday. \n\"They believed this was always going to go to Atlanta, that he didn't have it locked up in the first round by any means,\" Cardona said of Perez's campaign. \nThe email survey suggests that if the chairmanship race continues through several rounds of balloting, Perez might be in a better position to prevail than Ellison. While Ellison’s supporters had few qualms about backing Perez as their second choice, the same didn’t hold true for Perez backers -- few who ranked Perez as their first-choice candidate said they would back Ellison as their second choice. \n\"I'm surprised that Perez supporters are not picking Ellison as a second choice,\" said Washington state Democratic Party Chairwoman Tina Podlodowski, a Ellison supporter. \"I wonder if it's this desire for less dramatic change.\" \nIt might also be a sign of lingering resentment from the Democratic presidential primary. Ellison was an early and prominent Sanders surrogate. While he eventually came on board and worked hard for Clinton, there is still some bad blood among establishment Democrats who believe the Vermont senator’s tenacious primary challenge damaged Clinton’s chances in the general election.
