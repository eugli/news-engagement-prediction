The owners are also required to ensure that the site will be equipped with security and surveillance cameras. Furthermore MED have ordered that marijuana not be visible from outside the dispensary. \nThe Town of Parachute, a small community with a population of 1,100 people, welcomed the new business initiative as marijuana sales accounted for nearly 30 percent of just over $1 million of the town’s sales tax revenue in 2016, according to officials. \n“We think the drive-through is a very creative and innovative idea,” Parachute Town Manager Stuart McArthur said. “The really good news is that other businesses are benefiting from it.” \nREAD MORE: Colorado’s legalized marijuana has resulted in hospital visits for children – study \nMcArthur added that the drive through weed sales would generate more revenue for the entire town as visitors to Tumbleweed Express will likely stop at other businesses while in town. \nAfter the statewide recreational marijuana legalization in 2014, Colorado has increased its tax generated coffers. Last year pot sales in the state brought in close to $200 million in taxes and fees, according to the Colorado Department of Revenue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:11:22.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
