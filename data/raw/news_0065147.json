(Mujeeb Faruqui/HT‚ÄâFile Photo) \nCBSE-affiliated private schools will have to put up information about books prescribed by them on their websites to enhance transparency, allowing parents and others to flag objectionable content, if found. \nTo ensure schools take responsibility of the content being taught, the board is mulling asking the school principal and the manager to certify that they have read the content of the books prescribed. \nThey will be held responsible if objectionable content is found, sources in the ministry said. \nThe move comes after a Class 4 Environmental Studies book, ‚ÄòOur Green World‚Äô, of a Delhi school described the suffocation of a cat as an example to explain the importance of breathing. @HRDMinistry Delhi Class 4 text book actually asks kids to suffocate a kitten to death to explain that we'll die without airüò≥ @PMOIndia pic.twitter.com/ascMVdCfqU ‚Äî Kamna Pandey (@PandeyKamna) February 12, 2017 \nThe book was withdrawn after the publisher and the school came under fire and the publisher apologised. \n‚ÄúWe want to ensure that schools take responsibility of the content being taught in their schools. There has to be greater transparency. So if they upload the details of the books on their website, parents and anyone else will be able to check in case they find anything objectionable,‚Äù said a CBSE official. \nIn case a schools does not have a website, it can list the prescribed books on its notice boards, sources said. \nThe HRD ministry is working on a plan to have more NCERT books in circulation so that schools will not have to rely on private publishers who sell expensive books, officials said. \nAt the same time, there is no mandatory requirement to use books by NCERT, officials said. \nUnder the affiliation bye laws, the school and publishers are liable for any action and have to take responsibility of the content prescribed by them. Sources said most schools don‚Äôt follow this. \nSchools are also required to follow a syllabus based on the curriculum prescribed by NCERT for the middle classes or exercise extreme care while selecting books of private publishers. \n‚ÄúThe content must be scrutinised to preclude any objectionable content that hurts the sentiment of any class, community, gender, religious group in society. If found prescribing books having such content, the school will have to take responsibility of such content, provided that schools put a list of such books prescribed by it on the website with written declaration signed by manager and principal to the effect that they have gone through the content of the books prescribed by the school and own the responsibility,‚Äù states the bye law. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:15:49.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
