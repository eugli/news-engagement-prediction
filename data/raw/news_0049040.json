Ramalingam Pillai said members were told not to raise their prices during a meeting on Friday.\n“However, we also understand that our members cannot survive if they continue suffering lower profits,” he said yesterday.\nRamalingam said the cost of a banana leaf had gone up from between 15 sen and 20 sen a piece two years ago to between 30 sen and 50 sen a piece now.\n“Those in Klang Valley are forced to get their banana leaves from Pahang, Seremban and Malacca,” he added.\nHe said the association has 1,263 members operating some 5,300 banana leaf outlets nationwide and should abide by calls not to raise their prices next month.\n“If there are those raising their prices, they may not be our members,” he said.\nPrimas deputy president J. Suresh said the increase in banana leaf price was inevitable due to higher transport charges and bad weather.\n“Our association has been grappling with an increase in raw food items and the hike in the price of banana leaves is not helping our cause,” he said.\nMoorthy Mathaui Restaurant’s owner Moorthy Rengasamy, 60, said he had no choice but to raise the price by 50 sen to RM6.50 per serving.\n“Everything had gone up recently and even vegetables now cost three times more.\n“We will be under a lot of pressure if we do not raise our prices,” he said, adding that the hike was deemed minimal compared to the rise in the cost of living.\nMeanwhile, Original Penang Nasi Kandar Sdn Bhd’s owner Burhan Mohamed, 55, cautioned his customers that nasi kandar prices would inevitably go up too.\n“For the moment, I am still able to absorb rising costs for the benefit of lower and middle income customers.\n“But it can’t go on like this as no businessman does a business to make a loss,” he said.\nBurhan, who operates eight restaurants in the Klang Valley and one in Penang, said they recently received a circular stating that tea and coffee powder would cost RM2 per kilo as of March, a 100% rise from the present RM1 per kilo.\nHe also cited the drastic hike in fish prices as an example.\nMeanwhile in George Town, the price of banana leaves has gone up over the past few months.\nAnanda Bhawan Group of Restaurants owner V. Harikrishnan said the availability of banana leaves depended on the weather.\n“We use to pay about 20 sen per leaf but now our suppliers are charging between 30 and 35 sen due to the unpredictable weather,” he said.\nHe said bad weather would affect the supply as the leaves could be destroyed and reduce the day’s supply.\n“Besides the increase in price, we also have to pay transport charges to deliver the leaves to the restaurants,” added Harikrishnan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:09:01.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
