Liverpool laughed at for pitiful performance v Leicester [Tweets] By Paul Morrissey on Monday, February 27, 2017 Liverpool lose at Leicester \nLiverpool produced one of their worst performances of the season tonight, as they slumped to a 3-1 defeat at Leicester. \n3-0 down at one point and completely outplayed and overwhelmed by Leicester’s intensity, the Reds did manage to pull one back through Coutinho, but it was very much too little too late. \nIt’s hard to believe that Liverpool were riding high at the top of the table back in early November; with this defeat, they’re now barely hanging onto 5th spot, and could be sent down to 6th Manchester United by next weekend. \nThe season is spiralling out of control for Klopp’s men, and their chances of making the top four are looking slim at this point. So much for those 2 weeks in La Manga… \nWhat makes this pitiful performance even harder to fathom is that they had two weeks to prepare for it. \nWith two weeks to kill due to their elimination from the domestic ups, Jurgen Klopp flew his side out to sunny La Manga for a warm weather training camp. \nAnd it looks like they might have enjoyed the sun a bit too much, because they looked completely ill-prepared for this game. Leicester's players really are a bunch of snakes in the grass. #lcfc ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:11:14.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
