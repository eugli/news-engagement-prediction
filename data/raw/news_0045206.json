'I would like that we remember all the work he has done with us and all that he did during his time as a player.\n'I can't understand the booing, the short-term memory. It's eight titles out of (a possible) 10 with this coach. We are with him to the death.'\nAmong the eight titles, Enrique guided Barcelona to are a La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League treble in 2014-15.
