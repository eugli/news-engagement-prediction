The second point, is that it confirmed the importance of documenting the divorce to preserve the rights of the woman. The third point is that the Council gave the president the right to adopt a legislation to punish men who do not documenting the divorce,” Al-Abd told Al-Ahram Arabic newspaper.\nProminent constitutional law expert Nour Farahat tweeted that Al-Azhar sided with the views of senior jurists without looking at what happen in reality or taking into account the welfare interest and the developments happen in the society.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:03:56.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
