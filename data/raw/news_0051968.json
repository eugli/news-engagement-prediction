Media caption \"Alt-right is unstoppable\" - Milo Yiannopoulos \nIn his Facebook statement, Mr Yiannopoulos said: \"I find those crimes to be absolutely disgusting. I find those people to be disgusting.\" \nMr Yiannopoulos, who is openly gay, said he regretted using the word \"boys\" instead of young men while discussing gay relationships with large age gaps. \nHe blamed \"sloppy editing\" and \"usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humour\" for creating the wrong impression. \nHe also claimed that he himself had been a victim of child abuse. Image copyright AP Image caption Demonstrators at the University of California, Berkeley, where a talk by Mr Yiannopoulos was cancelled after violent protests \nMr Yiannopoulos is regularly associated with the alt-right , a disparate nationalistic group that is outspoken against so-called political correctness and feminism. It includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. \nHe says he does not consider himself part of the alt-right, although he has called it \"energising and exciting\". \nHe revels in courting controversy, and has written columns titled \"Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy\" and \"Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism or Cancer?\" \nEarlier this month the University of California at Berkeley cancelled Mr Yiannopoulos' speaking engagement there after violent protests broke out. \nPresident Trump - whom Mr Yiannopoulos refers to as \"daddy\" - threatened to cut the university's federal funding in response. \nHe was also banned from Twitter last year after leading a campaign of abuse against black Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:55:10.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
