I was actually thinking of going into a slightly more intensive line of outdoor pigs, but the local vet in Manjimup told me about Peter Bradford,\" he said.

(ABC Rural: Tyne Logan) \n\"I phoned him up and said can I come and have a look, he said no problem, so I went and had a look and thought this would actually work in well for me in the next couple of years while I'm transitioning from one to another.\" \nMr Hickman said the Bradfords had also been helping him with his operation, offering advice when he ran into issues. \nHe is running about 140 young pigs, with plans to build the operation up to a more commercial size over the next couple of years. \n\"In another two to three weeks I'll be selling some of my first porkers to some of the butcher shops that Peter has been selling to for quite a long time now,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:50:45.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
