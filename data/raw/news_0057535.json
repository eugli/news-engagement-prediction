From left: Fresh Fry executive vice president and chief strategy officer Brian Scantland,… more William DeShazer Jeremiah Chapman said a recent manufacturing agreement with Louisville's Whip Mix Corp. will take his business from new startup to viable business. Chapman is the co-founder and CEO of FreshFry LLC , which has created a pod used in the restaurant business to extend the life of frying oil. The pod, once dropped into the oil, will collect and dissolve impurities that make oil dirty so the oil stays clean longer. From left: Fresh Fry executive vice president and chief strategy officer Brian Scantland,… more William DeShazer \"It's a big need for a lot of people,\" Chapman said. FreshFry has been renting space from the longtime Louisville manufacturer, Whip Mix, which manufactures mostly dental products. With Whip Mix's help, FreshFry increased its production from 200 FreshFry pods per month early in 2016 to 16,000 at the beginning of this year. FreshFry already is planning another production increase of 5 percent later this year because the company is hitting capacity again. Chapman said he hopes to be creating 72,000 pods each month by this time next year. The pods retail for about $1.85 each, with varying prices for direct sales to restaurants. Chapman said the pods extend the life of the oil by 40 percent to 200 percent. The pods are available online at freshfry.me . The FreshFry team still does all of the mixing of the chemicals that keep the oil fresh, but Whip Mix has taken over the manufacturing of the pods and the packaging. \"We essentially have decades of manufacturing experience that's on our team that we didn't have to pay for up front,\" Chapman said. Usually a deal like the one between the two Louisville companies would require the startup to either give the manufacturer equity in the company or a cut of the profit, but Whip Mix didn't ask for that. Instead, FreshFry pays Whip Mix on a \"piece count,\" or per-pod, basis. Chapman declined to discuss terms of the agreement. \"It's great for startups because they need that flexibility,\" Chapman said. \"They are completely understanding of startup margins, and they were very flexible.\" In fact, Whip Mix officials have been flexible every step of the way, Chapman said. Whip Mix has been able to step in when FreshFry needs manufacturing help, but it hasn't pressured the startup to do anything its not ready to do. When the company first moved into the FreshFry warehouse last May, it was just renting the space. Then, when the startup needed help manufacturing the pods, the agreement changed. And the agreement was changed again when FreshFry needed help packaging. \"The agreement develops every time we need it to,\" Chapman said. \"Whip Mix leaned in with us.\" Stuart Steinbock , vice president of business development for Whip Mix, said the startup is a perfect fit for the company. Steinbock was a large part of the push behind Whip Mix's decision to get involved with startups in Louisville. He said the company works with another startup that produces the resin for 3D printing. \"We just look at it as a way to grow and diversify our manufacturing,\" he said. \"We've signed on a handful of clients.\" Whip Mix has about 145 employees in Louisville, plus specialized plants in Fort Collins, Colo., and Germany. Steinbock said the company will use its Louisville employees from manufacturing lines that aren't busy to do the side projects for startups. It's not revenue that the business relies on, though. \"For us, this is one way that we're trying to be entrepreneurs and find and attract more entities like FreshFry,\" he said. He said he realizes that Whip Mix has \"an entire business dedicated to designing, selling and manufacturing dental supplies,\" but that's not all the company can do. Steinbock said that with the equipment in the facility and a skilled manufacturing staff, \"We're really well-suited to help those startups scale up. We can create these startup products. I'm using my excess equipment and employees. We can labor share with our team members to help these guys until they hit the scale that requires dedicated team members.\" And, he said, Whip Mix employees bring a lot of different skill sets to the table. \"I think we're one of the few that will work to make a manufacturing line for a company and then run it for them,\" Steinbock said. \"This is more of a side division that we're growing and nurturing.\" Bridgett Weaver covers technology, banking, entrepreneurs and retail.
