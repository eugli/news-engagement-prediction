while some businesses wanted to remain closed, the option needed to be available to attract bigger stores. \nStratford shops will allowed to open on Easter Sunday, despite some councillors speaking against the move. \nOn Tuesday, the Stratford District Council's (SDC) policy and monitoring committee voted to give shops the option to open, with councillors Peter Dalziel and John Sandford voting against it while Gloria Webby put in an apology for the meeting. \nIn 2015, the Government changed the law to allow councils to set their own rules around whether shops could open on Easter Sunday. \nDuring the debate before the vote, Sandford said he supported keeping the status quo. \nREAD MORE: * Community board in favour of Easter trading consultation disappointed it's a council decision \n\"Is it nice that people in our town can actually have some time off?\" he asked. \nHe also pointed out that while Foodstuffs, the franchisor for New World and 4Square, had supported the change, Stratford New World owner Dan Harris' submission was against it. \nWhile Foodstuffs said shops needed to stay open for people who travelled to Stratford for the holiday, Sandford argued they would already be able to buy what they needed from the shops that could already open. \n\"For me, it should stay as it is because we're not a tourist destination, and anyway the tourists can still come and get what they need in the town,\" he said. \n\"Let's think about the workers and we should think about families getting some family time together which they don't get enough of.\" \nDalziel, the chairman of the Stratford Business Association, said he agreed with Sandford's stance that shops should remain closed on the day. \n\"I think this discussion would be a bit more relevant if our retailers opened every Sunday, or even Saturday afternoon,\" he said. \n\"We haven't even got to grips with Saturday trading, which came in in the 80's. \n\"We're talking one day of the year where every other Sunday of the year they don't open.\" \nHowever, the pair were voted down with mayor Neil Volzke, deputy mayor Alan Jamieson and councillors Grant Boyde, Graham Kelly, Rick Coplestone, Keryn Walsh, Jono Erwood and Kelvin Squire all voting for the change. \nCoplestone said while most business had indicated they wouldn't open on the day, the council needed to have the option available if it wanted to attracted bigger stores such as Repco to the district. \n\"I think we need to give people the freedom of choice,\" he said. \n\"I think the majority in the submissions stands for itself.\" \nOf the 23 submissions received by the SDC, 15 were in favour of full trading, two wanted it restricted and six wanted to stay with the status quo. \nKelly, who clapped when the council voted for the change, said during the discussion that society was changing. \n\"If you're a religious person and don't like it, you won't go shopping, you'll go to church instead and that's fine,\" he said. \n\"People are working around the clock so they should have the right to shop or open their business at any time.\" \nUnder the legislation passed by the Government in 2015, councils can decide to allow all shops to open, only those in certain areas to open or only those that are already exempt, such as dairies, petrol stations and garden centres. \nIf a council did allow shops to open, employees would be allowed to decline working on the Sunday and wouldn't have to give their boss a reason. \nLiam Dagg, director of environmental services, said the policy would be in place in time for shops to open this Easter, in eight weeks' time. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:00:44.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
