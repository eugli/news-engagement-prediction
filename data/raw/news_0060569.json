Nasr was taken to a military base and then moved to Egypt where he was allegedly tortured even as an Italian court convicted him on terrorism-related charges. \n\nBut in 2009, another Italian court sentenced 26 Americans, including de Sousa, in absentia of kidnapping and other charges related to the abduction. Most have since been pardoned and not one has done time in prison, but a dual citizenship appears to have put Sousa in European crosshairs. \n\nIn October 2015, she was detained at Lisbon's airport on a European arrest warrant while attempting to travel to India, where she still has family. She was later released but ordered to remain in Portugal. \n\nOn Monday, she was detained for extradition to Italy after Rome press for compliance on an European warrant, even as the Trump administration expressed disappointment and said it would intervene in the matter. \n\n''The US government's view is that this [conviction] was a violation of her diplomatic status,'' a Senior administration official told Fox News, adding, ''We're very concerned and following the case closely... the highest levels of our government are trying to intervene on her behalf.'' \n\nA former CIA field officer who used diplomatic cover, de Sousa sued the US State Department in 2009 seeking diplomatic immunity for her alleged role in the kidnapping. She lost the lawsuit but maintained that although she worked undercover for the CIA when the kidnapping took place, she has no role in it and was unaware of the plans. \n\nThe case will test the Trump administration's resolve against the EU in the light of the President's well-known skepticism of Washington's European allies, both in the form of Nato and EU. Domestically too, the President evokes divided feeling in the intelligence community. \n\nEarlier this week, a career CIA official seconded to the White House quit the administration saying Trump has shown he has no respect for intelligence agencies and no regard for intelligence inputs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:46:55.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
