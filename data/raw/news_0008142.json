But this is the sort of intervention (not enough, obviously, for those who would cancel the road) that is crucial if the city is to be changed in a way that people do not permanently resent. And if they want to add more housing to the city, it makes some sense to compliment that housing with parkland people can access. \nThough the state government does not miss a chance to declare itself \"open for business\", the most successful politician in terms of building new dwellings in the state has been Clover Moore. Sydney's lord mayor has overseen staggering amounts of new housing, and yet she was last year returned to office with a swing of 10 per cent. \nThe point here is that Moore has been able to increase housing supply, which Berejiklian says she is intent on doing, in a way that people are more or less comfortable with. And she's done that not by allowing developers free rein – but by working to shape places in ways that make people comfortable. \nStokes – who has been studying for a masters through Oxford to do his job better – gave the impression of espousing similar values. He spoke about the importance of design, and of promoting denser forms of housing that did not overwhelm existing neighbourhoods. \nYet he leaves the job with a huge amount to be done. The Planning Act remains a mess. Six years after promising to return planning powers to local communities, the state has only centralised decision making. There is no affordable housing policy worthy of the name. A government \"affordable housing taskforce\" set up in 2011 never even handed down a final report. \nSo why did Berejiklian shaft Stokes? Was it because his criticisms of negative gearing embarrassed her or her friends in Canberra? Was it because the property industry wanted to let the market rip more than Stokes was seeming to allow? Or was it simple political churlishness? \nIn the end, those questions don't matter so much as the result. What matters is whether the state will have housing policies that deliver for people on a broad range of incomes, and which produce places people will be glad to live in, without consigning them to lives stuck in traffic. \nThese problems are now Anthony Roberts' to resolve. And if he can't do so, the state will have Berejiklian to blame. \nJacob Saulwick is city editor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T13:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T08:23:17.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
