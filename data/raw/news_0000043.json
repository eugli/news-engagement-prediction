Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA fed-up mother says her special needs daughter can no longer cope with the stress caused by strikes at her school - sharing a snap that shows the girl in tears. \nCharlotte Gun took the photo of her distraught daughter, Katie-Ann Boyle, 15, who had tears running down her face, after arriving at school to collect her. \nShe decided to share the photo on Facebook along with a message describing how strikes by certain staff members, including teaching assistants who help pupils with special needs, have affected Katie-Ann. \nMrs Gunn, 33, told the Derby Telegraph that teaching assistants are the \"backbone\" of special needs education, and blasted council bosses over cuts because her daughter's needs at school are \"not being met\".

Our special-needs children rely on their teaching assistants – they are the backbone of special needs schooling. \n\"Without them many needs of our children can't be met. According to the council the strikes are having little or no effect. \n\"Try telling that to my child, I've had to comfort the entire way home because she can't understand what is happening. \n\"I guess the strikes just don't affect the schools that matter. But my daughter's education counts, too, maybe not (to the council) but to her and us it's her future.\" \nShe said in sharing the photo of Katie-Ann, who has a range of complex needs which include severe learning difficulties, she is giving her daughter a voice because she is not able to speak for herself. \nMrs Gunn added: \"Because of her special needs she cannot cope with having no routine. All I can do is support the teaching assistants as much as possible by sharing the stories.\" \nUnison has called three more full days of strikes next week. \nMirror Online has contacted Derby City Council for comment.
