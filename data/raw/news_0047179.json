Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA teenage girl who was cruelly called \"It\" by classmates after being born a boy has inspired the first transgender doll. \nJazz Jennings was diagnosed with gender identity disorder at the age of just three and began living as a girl full-time two years later following tests and counselling. \nThe teen, one of the youngest people known to have transitioned, published her memoirs last year and has been praised for helping to shape attitudes towards transgender people. \nThe 16-year-old has been named as one of Time magazine's 25 most influential teens, starred in her own reality TV show, and has now been celebrated by the Tonner Doll Company. \nThe manufacturer, which specialises in adult collectibles and high fashion dolls, is to release a Jazz Jennings doll designed by founder Robert Tonner. When Jeanette and Gregs son was just two years old he asked when the fairy was coming to make him into a girl. He was diagnosed with gender identity disorder when he was three and started dressing as a girl full time from the age of four (Photo: PA Real Life Features) \nThe doll will come in pink shirt and jean shorts, mirroring the outfit worn by Jazz on the cover of her memoir, Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen. \nTonner said: \"Jazz stands for everything I respect from a human nature point of view. She's incredibly brave, intelligent, warm-hearted and creative.\" \nIt was unveiled at the New York Toy Fair at the weekend ahead of its release in July and will be marketed to children rather than as an adult collectible.

Jazz said she hoped the doll would show transgender people in a positive light (Photo: Instagram/jazzjennings) \nJazz has told how she \"longed to be a girl” from as young as she can remember. \nShe said: “Mum tells me that even as a two-year-old when she praised me for being a good boy, I’d correct her saying, ‘I’m a good girl.’ \n“When I was two, Mum says I asked when the fairy was going to come with a magic wand and take away my penis.” \nHer parents were supportive but she faced taunts at school. \nJazz said: “At lunchtime some of the girls wouldn’t sit with me and some of the boys even called me ‘it’. When I got home I’d cry. \n“I wasn’t allowed to use the boys’ or girls’ toilets, I had to go to the nurse’s office to use the bathroom. I felt so isolated.” Jazz Jennings as a boy (Photo: PA Real Life Features) \nBut she refused to let bullies get the better of her. \n“By the time I was 10, almost everyone in school knew I was transgender” she said. \n“I had a close group of girl friends who would stand by me, and the older I got, the more comfortable I became, so I tried not to let the bullies upset me.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:54:25.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
