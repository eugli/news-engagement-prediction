The man worked at the farm.\nFirefighters, police, search experts from Montreal, as well as search dogs are at the scene.\nAlmost 80 per cent of the building collapsed, making the search process slow and painstaking.\nThe roof collapsed on a building with animals in it. One person is missing. (Maude Montembeault/Radio-Canada)\nAlexandre Mizoguchi, chief of special operations for the Montreal fire department, said crews have combed through about a third of the debris so far.\n\"It's complicated because we have a potential victim, who is possibly still alive, [so] we have to proceed in a very surgical manner,\" he said.\nRescuers are using four mechanical shovels to remove pieces of the structure piece by piece to ensure the safety of the missing man and of the rescuers.\nThey have tried turning off all the machines to see if they could hear the man, and even called his cell phone because they knew he had it on him, to no avail.\nThe SQ confirmed that animals were in the building when the roof collapsed. Most made it out alive.\nwith files from Radio-Canada", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:05:44.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
