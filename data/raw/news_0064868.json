I appeal to you to come forward and support the BJP to make the state free from parties who have only looted the state,” Shah said. \nShah’s choice of letters though are more than just a stringing together of the first syllables of the BJP’s rival parties; it is also the name of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack convict Ajmal Kasab , the only one to have been caught alive. Kasab was hanged in 2012. \n“Do not take any other meaning when I say KASAB. What I mean by KASAB is -- Ka for Congress, Sa for Samajwadi Party and B for BSP. Until you don’t end KASAB, UP will not progress,” Shah told the crowd of supporters. #WATCH : BJP President Amit Shah in Chauri Chaura asks people of Uttar Pradesh to get rid of 'KASAB' and what he means by it. pic.twitter.com/BZz3tYFGp5 — ANI UP (@ANINewsUP) February 22, 2017 \nShah also took pot shots at the state chief minister, saying his scheme of free laptops was implemented after asking people their religion. \n“Akhilesh is UP’s chief minister for last five years. Why does he ask ‘kab ayenge achche din’ (When will good days come)?” Shah said in response to Akhilesh’s attack on the BJP’s 2014 general election slogan. \nHe even attacked Akhilesh for campaigning for a minister accused of rape, instead of sending him to jail.

He also called on candidates on five assembly seats of Varanasi — Varanasi North, Varanasi South, Cantt, Sevapuri, and Rohania. Varanasi has eight assembly seats.
