The threshold, of 15 parts per billion, was passed multiple times by both schools, with P.S .41 faring particularly badly. \nFive faucets at the school tested more than 100 ppb, with one a staggering 442 ppb. I.S.158 fared better with the highest level of lead coming in at 63.8 ppb. To put this into context, during the Flint crisis 90 percent of homes tested had a lead rating of 27 ppb. 1,000 days of toxic drinking water in #Flint https://t.co/keoSCQwwCJ pic.twitter.com/810ukSklty — RT America (@RT_America) 21 January 2017 \nThese latest figures come just weeks after checks on “every potential source of water for drinking or preparing food” at another NYC school , P.S./I.S. 217, showed eight out of the 100 units tested had elevated lead levels.

For that reason, the samples taken during testing are not representative of the water students have access to throughout the day.” \nCity Councilman Andy King, whose granddaughter attends the affected P.S. 41 school, gave a press conference calling for the fixtures and pipes to be updated.
