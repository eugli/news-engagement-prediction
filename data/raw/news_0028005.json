Get Me Out Of Here! \n“Don’t start, I will ruin your life,” Smith told Swan in the South African jungle camp. \n“I know what you’re thinking, don’t even think about it because I would be out ... I would be out quicker than you could blink.” \nEarlier Maguire told campmates: “I know Kris. We see each other all the time.” \nMaguire, 30, has been unlucky in love since competing on the last season of The Bachelor . \nShe entered the I’m A Celebrity camp on Tuesday night , joining Smith and 10 celebrities who have been living on basic rations for two-and-a-half weeks.

I don’t know about in the jungle because I am going to be covered in dirt, I am going to smell like camp fire, can you imagine coming up to him? I will do my best. I will have a crack.” \nSmith this week revealed he is not single, despite telling his campmates he was and that he still has feelings for his ex. He didn’t specify however whether or not he was referring to either former partners Danni Minogue or Maddy King. \n“I’m reconnecting with my ex and everything else,” he said. \n“It is just fresh, we are talking again about fixing things up. I have just got a lot of feelings for her.” \n* The journalist is in South Africa as a guest of Channel Ten.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:19:48.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
