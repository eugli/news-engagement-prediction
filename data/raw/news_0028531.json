Pic/PTI \nThe figure 99 proved lucky for India's blind cricketer Prakash Jayaramaiah.\nJayaramaiah remained unbeaten only to miss out on a century by one run in yesterday's blind T20 World Cup final where India successfully defended its crown by defeating arch-rivals Pakistan in Bangalore.\n\"I have no regrets about not being able to complete my century. India's victory was more important than my ton,\" Jayaramaiah said. \"I didn't feel nervous. In this tournament, I've scored 96, 99, 99, 115 and 99. On the contrary, finishing in the 90s proves lucky for me,\" he added.\nThe B-3 category blind player from Karnataka, who won the man of the match (R10,000) as well as the man of the series awards (R25,000) will distribute the prize money among his teammates. \"All prize money won collectively and individually will be shared with the players,\" he added.\nJayaramaiah admitted India were lucky to beat a strong Pakistan side. \"There was some pressure playing Pakistan. They are a really strong team and we are lucky to beat them in the last two finals,\" said the India vice-captain, who is playing in his second T20 World Cup. He has also been part of the ODI World Cup squad.\nWhen asked about the celebrations, Jayaramaiah said, \"Our coach does not favour late-night parties. But yes, this will be an exception. All of us are so excited with this win,\" he signed off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:27:25.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
