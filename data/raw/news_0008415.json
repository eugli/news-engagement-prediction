If it involves the current White House, and it sounds nefarious, double-check it.\nFor example, the Trump administration did not quietly amend the language to the Bill of Rights as it appears on the White House website, contrary to a claim spread this week on Twitter.\n\"No big deal—just the White House re-writing Bill of Rights to replace references to 'persons/people' w/ 'citizens,'\" said the originator of the phony claim. \"Not a joke. Not a drill.\"\nThis person was soon corrected by a number of journalists who recognized immediately that his claim was nonsense.\nThe Obama administration had also used \"citizen\" in place of \"persons\" and \"people\" multiple times, as cached versions of the White House website clearly show. In short, the suggestion that the Trump administration had done something nefarious by quietly updating the language on the current website is total bunko.\nThe person who sent the tweet about the supposedly changed language deleted his note Tuesday morning, and issued a mea culpa of sorts. But not before his false claim was retweeted and spread on social media at least 700 times.\nAnd that is how false narratives are born.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner AARP opposes Republican Medicaid shakeup Seniors lobby says using per-capita funding could hurt low-income baby boomers.\nBy Robert King • 01/31/17 4:57 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:05:38.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
