Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd Mr Westwell met Miss Higgins online in 2014 after she split from the father of her young son Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd 5 The pair initially lived together but Lyndsey moved into a nearby flat where she stayed after rows \n“I said to her we won’t have any of this silliness tonight and she got upset saying I was calling her silly.“I said I wasn’t, but I didn’t want to eat anymore so we went back to my house. \nAfter the row, he and Lyndsey had text each other to apologise, and she asked him to come round the next morning. \nBut when he arrived he found her on the sofa cuddling a picture of her son after taking sleeping tablets. \nHe took her to hospital and stayed with her until she came round, when she began shouting that she wanted to go home. \n“I got a text from her saying: ”I’ve done it, thanks.” I replied with ‘done what?’ but she didn’t text me after that so I called 999.” \nMr Westwell – who met Ms Higgins on a dating sate in January 2014 – said he went to her flat but found her dead. \nHe added: “Lyndsey was beautiful and I greatly regret not being able to get her the help she needed.” \nMiss Higgins’ mother Pam, 64, told the inquest Lyndsey was the “life and soul of the party” and turned her life around after suffering depression. \n”I would describe her and Martin’s relationship as volatile. It went from one extreme to the other, we tried to get her to come back, and say look this isn’t working out how you wanted. \n“She had a place to go, her bedroom was ready and waiting and we had a nursery place for her son sorted. \n“Lyndsey had everything to live for. My main concern is why the hospital didn’t try to contact us at all? \n“She had written the contact details down so why didn’t they contact us?” \nThe inquest continues. \nDo you need help?
