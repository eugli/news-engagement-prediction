Speaking with New York Magazine correspondent, Spencer claimed \"Depeche Mode is the official band of the alt-right.\" Richard Spencer, asked if he likes rock music, says \"Depeche Mode is the official band of the alt-right.\" — Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) February 23, 2017 Depeche Mode, the British group behind hits like “Personal Jesus,” “Everything Counts,” and “People Are People” is gearing up for a tour and likely didn’t think it’d have to respond to something like this. But Esquire reached out for comment, and the band’s representative said it’s “pretty ridiculous”:\n“Depeche Mode has no ties to Richard Spencer or the alt-right and does not support the alt-right movement.” \nSpencer later said he’s “obviously joking,” a familiar refrain for guys who fancy themselves comedians these days. However, “Personal Jesus” does have the the perfect punchable rhythm for Super Deluxe’s Punch a Nazi!! game, and someone has already added “Just Can’t Get Enough” to the video of Spencer getting punched in the face.
