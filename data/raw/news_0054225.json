This is him telling me he is scared and thinks he won't see his 11th birthday. This is him and me, telling him that I will continue to fight for him when he can't. This is him and me, and our world. \nHours after the Facebook post, Medinger had to take Drake to the emergency room after his heart rate slowed down and he would not eat or drink, according to a YouCaring crowdfunding page that has raised more than $29,000 for his medical treatments. Drake might have to get a feeding tube to help his recovery. \nNo doubt that the more than 327,000 people who reacted to the post, and more than 64,000 people who shared it, are hoping that he will pull through.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:01:07.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
