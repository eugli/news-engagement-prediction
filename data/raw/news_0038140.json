When a manager never appeared, Crawford said he had the bag checked because he didn‚Äôt want to delay everyone on the plane. \nThe defensive tackle said he called the employee a ‚Äúbum‚Äù for not letting him keep the bag on the plane and refused to move out of the flight attendant‚Äôs way for what he called ‚Äúa minute.‚Äù \nCrawford was then asked to come to the front of the plane, where he was removed. \nCrawford told Ben and Skin that people on the plane booed the employee when he was asked to leave. \nAmerican Airlines has replied to Crawford on twitter and says they would like to look into what happened. @TCrawford98 We'd like to look into what happened. Please DM your record locator and share more of what happened. \n‚Äî American Airlines (@AmericanAir) February 16, 2017 \nCrawford, who‚Äôs from Canada, said he was returning to Windsor to visit family and watch his cousin compete in a sporting event.
