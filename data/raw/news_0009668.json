(Photo: Stefano Boeri Architetti) A \nNANJING: Italian architect Stefano Boeri is set to bring the vertical forest concept which has gained popularity in Milan to the Chinese city of Nanjing. \nThe Nanjing Green Towers, which are slated for completion in 2018, will be flourished with 1,100 trees as well as 2500 cascading plants and shrubs. \nThe project is expected to reduce the impact of pollution in the city by absorbing 25 tons of carbon dioxide a year and producing 60kg of oxygen a day. Nanjing is one of China's cities that suffer from air pollution. \nWhen completed, the towers will rise 107m and 199m above Nanjing's Pukou district. \nThe shorter tower will host a Hyatt hotel while the taller tower will be home to a museum, offices and an architectural school.
