He then announced his new venture will be located at 201 Coleman Blvd. in Mount Pleasant and is named NICO . In keeping with the slow roll out of information, the press received another small nugget of NICO today. The forthcoming Romo restaurant will be a “a modern and lively French oyster bar serving wood-fired seafood and French cuisine.” There will be classic raw bar fare and French brasserie cuisine, like baked lobster, offered in the entrees. Romo will heavily source seafood from local waters. The dining room will have indoor and outdoor seating. The look will be “contemporary French” with natural wood and leather banquettes. Once open, sometime this spring, NICO will serve dinner seven days a week from 4:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. and brunch on weekends from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:12:47.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
