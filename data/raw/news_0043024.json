Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what’s happening in Brussels. You look at what’s happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris.” Donald Trump attacks media \nCrime rates have stayed relatively stable in Sweden during the past 10 years, according to the 2016 Swedish Crime Survey. \nMr Trump's comments sparked speculation that the US President had become confused over an attack in Pakistan. \nOn Friday, 80 people were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the Sufi shrine in the city of Sehwan. \nMeanwhile, social media was flooded by both ridicule and no little confusion at Mr Trump's comments. \nAn official @sweden Twitter account, which is controlled by a different citizen each week and currently has a school librarian at the helm, posted: \"Might as well do a stand along tweet about this... Since I'm being swamped with questions about Trump's speech. No. Nothing has happened here in Sweden. There has not ben any terrorist attacks here. At all. The main news right now is about Melfest. -> — @sweden / Emma (@sweden) February 19, 2017 \n\"No. Nothing has happened here in Sweden. There has not ben any terrorist attacks here. At all. The main news right now is about Melfest,\" it added, referring to an annual music festival. \nThe Swedish news organisation Aftonbladet posted a story on the incidents which really did occur in the country on Friday under the headline \"This happened in Sweden Friday night, Mr President\".

Here is what really happened in #Sweden : pic.twitter.com/qr5NEavfjG — Ines Helene (@inihelene) February 19, 2017 \nThe president's claims were also widely mocked on social media. \nFormer footballer Gary Lineker tweeted: \"Thoughts are with everyone in Sweden at this difficult time.\" Thoughts are with everyone in Sweden at this difficult time. — Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) February 19, 2017 \nComedian Rob Delaney added sarcastically: \"Please pray for my son Glavynn who lost a buttock in yesterday's Feminist terror attack in Sweden. #MAGA\". \nAlongside a picture of Swedish pop group Abba, one social media user posted: \"Four extremists responsible for #swedenincident are still at large, if you see these people phone @realDonaldTrump at once\".

Did they catch the Bowling Green Massacre perpetrators?\" \nAt the same rally on Saturday, Mr Trump launched a fresh scathing attack on news organisations, accusing the “dishonest media” of publishing false stories, pledging he will “never, ever let them get away with it\".
