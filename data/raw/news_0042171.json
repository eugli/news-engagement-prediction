The threshold used to be $49. \nNow you only have to spend $35 at Amazon to get free two-day shipping. CNET \nRetail giant Amazon apparently doesn't want Walmart to offer a better deal on shipping. \nWithout promotion, Amazon has lowered the minimum required for free two-day US shipping from $49 to $35 , something The Verge noticed this weekend and reported on Sunday . That threshold applies to shoppers who are not Prime members, and the minimum for free shipping on books remains $25. \nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation on the timing and comment on why it made the move. \nHowever, competitor Walmart, just last month , cut its membership program while at the same time cutting the minimum for free shipping to $35. It also sped up those deliveries to two days. \nIt's all part of an apparent battle for online shoppers who have yet to join Prime. An estimated 44 percent of US households subscribe to Prime, making them far more likely to shop regularly with Amazon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:12:59.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
