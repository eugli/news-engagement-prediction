The young trio of defenders will command big fees if the Chelsea boss decides he can do without any of them.\nBournemouth bid Â£18million for Ake last month and Southampton have an eye on him as a potential replacement if and when they lose Van Dijk.\nUp front, where the future of Diego Costa again unclear, Conte will return to test Real Madrid on their willingness to sell Morata having failed to land him last summer.\nThe Blues will also continue their pursuit of Celtic forward Moussa Dembele\nWith Michy Batshuayi yet to convince, Chelsea will also continue their pursuit of Dembele from Celtic.\nAsmir Begovic, who almost joined Bournemouth last month, can be expected to leave and be replaced.\nJohn Terry, out of contract again in June, is unlikely to extend his playing career at the Bridge and Cesc Fabregas is not integral to Conte's plans, although reluctant to leave.\nConte will return to test Real Madrid's willingness to sell Alvaro Morata\nConte wants at least five new recruits, adding cover and competition at wing-back and in central midfield, especially as he appears certain to be back in Europe.\nChelsea have made the mistake of resting on laurels in the past having won the title. It happened under Carlo Ancelotti in 2010 and under Jose Mourinho in 2015.\nIt will create for Conte a squad of his own making.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-02T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:41:29.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
