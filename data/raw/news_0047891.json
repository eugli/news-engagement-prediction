He’s busy sharing “dank memes” on Facebook. Shad — better known as Bow Wow (formerly Lil Bow Wow, till Bow Wow grew into an older canine moniker) — is just the latest victim of the latest celebrity death hoax. An article titled “BREAKING NEWS: Shad Moss AKA Bow Wow Was Found Dead Inside His Miami Home” is being spread around once again, with claims that Bow Wow died of benzodiazepine intoxication — one of the causes of death for Michael Jackson, as reported by Us Weekly . \nA post shared by Bow wow (@shadmoss) on Feb 19, 2017 at 3:00pm PST \nThe fake news report went on to claim that Bow Wow was discovered in Miami, Florida, by his personal trainer. \n“His personal Trainer, Lisa Willis, said she had found Bow Wow in his room, not breathing and with a barely detectable pulse, and that he administered CPR on Bow Wow to no avail. After a call was placed to 9-1-1 at 12:21 p.m., Shad Moss was treated by paramedics at the scene and was later pronounced dead at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. The Los Angeles County Coroner concluded that his death was a homicide. Shortly before his death, Jackson had reportedly been administered propofol and two anti-anxiety benzodiazepines—lorazepam and midazolam—in his home. Bow Wow death triggered an outpouring of reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of Internet traffic and causing sales of his music and that of the Mr Moss [sic] to increase dramatically.” \nAccording to Trendolizer , the article has seen quite of bit of traffic, with one version of the fake news article getting 29,000 Facebook likes. Trend graph: \nSome folks reacting to the fake news story are busy writing their condolences on social media. Others are recognizing the fake news for what it is, commenting that this isn’t the first time that fake news writers have killed off Bow Wow via fake articles. \nOn the official Facebook account of Bow Wow , there isn’t news about any tragic death, only recent Facebook posts of a bunch of different memes. \nAs seen in the above photo, Bow Wow appeared with Erica Mena at the Furious 7 premiere, in Los Angeles at the TCL Chinese Theatre IMAX on Wednesday, April 1, 2015. \nOn Twitter, as of this writing, the most recent update to Bow Wow’s account is dated Saturday, February 18, and featured Moss bemoaning the fact that he could not delete his Twitter account as he desired — and wrote that perhaps he couldn’t figure out how to delete his own Twitter account. That Twitter post may have been the reason for the resurgence in the fake death hoax surrounding Bow Wow. Perhaps those who have written the fake news articles viewed Bow Wow’s impending choice to delete his Twitter account as a reason to create a death hoax about him, since Bow Wow would have one less avenue to refute the fake stories. Trying to delete my twitter … they wont let me do it or dont know how \n— Shad Moss(Bow Wow) (@smoss) February 18, 2017 \nOn Instagram, Bow Wow noted that he’s only two weeks away from his 30th birthday. In the comments section of Moss’s below Instagram post, folks are noting that Shad is very much alive. \nA post shared by Bow wow (@shadmoss) on Feb 19, 2017 at 9:45am PST \nIn another recent post on Instagram, Bow Wow posted a photo of himself with smoke billowing from his facial orifices, with a description that noted despite the fickle nature of folks loving him one week and hating him the next, Bow Wow still gained income both weeks. \nA post shared by Bow wow (@shadmoss) on Feb 19, 2017 at 12:25am PST \nWith nearly seven million fans on his official Facebook page, it’s no wonder Bow Wow became the latest celebrity death hoax victim, due to his popularity. On Instagram, Shad enjoys 3.3 million followers. Much of the reaction to Bow Wow’s fake death on Facebook shows a mix of folks believing the fake reports and mourning his death, whereas others are criticizing the fake news creators. \n[Featured Image by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:45:22.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
