It carries out more than 300 checks to weed out fake listings and searches the internet to see if photos are duplicates.\nYet Money Mail has heard from readers who been conned out of thousands of pounds, after crooks evaded detection.\nIn every case, the customer was refused a refund until we intervened.\nHOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP Cut the cost of your insurance bills: Compare prices for all types of cover in minutes Phil Moran, from London, booked a family holiday on Airbnb last August, after friends raved about the spectacular properties available.\nHe and partner Anna found a beautiful villa with a pool on the island of Ibiza, which looked ideal for their children, Nora, nine, and Stan, 11.\nThe website showed 19 pictures of the Spanish property — and one of a couple, whom Phil believed to be the hosts.\nIt described in detail the villa's features and picturesque surroundings.\nPhil, 56, who runs an executive head-hunting firm, used Airbnb's online messaging system to contact the villa owner, Elise, about a nine-night stay.\nFIVE STEPS TO BEAT THE AIRBNB SCAMMERS\nAlways book via Airbnb's messaging and payment system. If you don't, the company won't refund you. Check that the website address begins with airbnb.com — anything else is a fake site. Don't respond to emails purporting to be from Airbnb that ask you to enter bank details or your address. Avoid emails that urge you to act immediately to stop your account being disabled — these are scams. If in doubt, report the owner to Airbnb. She replied saying Airbnb's messaging system was faulty and asked him to send a personal email instead. After exchanging eight emails, they agreed on a price of £3,371 for the booking.\nElise arranged for Phil to talk to her husband on the phone to finalise the details.\nThen she sent another email, saying that the website's payment system was also broken, and asked Phil to pay by bank transfer instead.\nAs soon as Phil wired the money, all went quiet. Hours passed and he didn't receive the booking confirmation as promised.\nElise and her husband stopped replying to his emails and calls and, when Phil contacted Airbnb customer service, it had no record of his booking.\n'I can't believe I fell for it because I deal with complicated deals every day,' says Phil. 'I was in a rush to book a holiday and, with everyone telling me it was safe, I just assumed it would all be fine.'\nAirbnb refused to refund the £3,371 because Phil had paid by bank transfer.\nUnder the site's rules, users must arrange and pay for their holiday through its own messaging and payment system. This allows the firm to keep track of bookings and any money paid.\nThe website makes it clear that, if you contact an owner using a private email address or pay them directly, you have no protection if something goes wrong.\nAirbnb attaches warnings to every message you send via its secure system. However, Money Mail could not find any such notices on the pages where you make a booking or a payment.\nStuffed: Airbnb refused to refund Phil's £3,371 because had paid by bank transfer\nAirbnb also says it tries to remove owners' personal contact details from property listings.\nBut, as Phil found, fraudsters have become adept at luring holidaymakers away from the official Airbnb message and payment systems — and onto their own email addresses.\nSkie Powell, 22, from Kent, was caught out last December when scammers put their contact details on a photograph of a villa.\nCUT YOUR TRAVEL MONEY COSTS Heading on holiday? You may want to leave your debit or credit card in safely in your wallet to avoid hefty fees.\nMost providers charge around 3 per cent for foreign transactions or for using an ATM.\nThere are several specialist accounts and cards which offer reduced fees or waive overseas charges altogether .\nIf you would rather not change banks, currency cards offer holidaymakers the chance to load up a card with money to spend while they are away and potentially benefit from lower rates.\nReader offer: FairFX is offering This is Money and MailOnline readers a free MasterCard prepaid card, which usually costs £9.95.\nSkie and seven friends booked a five-bedroom property for a long weekend in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, in February.\nNew to Airbnb, she saw the email address on one of the pictures and used it to contact the owner.\nShe was asked to transfer £984 to a bank account in payment.\nWhen Skie logged onto Airbnb later that month, there was no trace of the booking. She reported the incident to the company but, as in Phil's case, Airbnb refused to refund her money because she hadn't gone through its own payment system.\n'It comes down to Airbnb advertising something fraudulent,' says Skie. 'We wouldn't have booked if we thought it was unsafe.'\nGeorge Hayward, from Brighton, East Sussex, fell for the same trick when booking an apartment in Amsterdam for his 24th birthday celebration. Again, one of the photographs of the property had an email address written on it. He contacted the owner and paid £1,100 by bank transfer for himself and five friends.\nTwo weeks later, George received an email saying that his booking had been cancelled and his money would be returned. But the cash never arrived and, again, Airbnb refused to refund his money.\nAn Airbnb spokesman says: 'As long as you only communicate using our secure messaging system, and only send money through Airbnb, you will always be protected.\n'The only way scams can ever work is if the scammer convinces someone to pay them directly.\n'This is why we warn folks not to do that, as well as try to ensure bad actors can't give personal information out in the first place.'\nAfter Money Mail contacted Airbnb, it agreed to pay full refunds to Phil, Skie and George.\np.thomas@dailymail.co.uk\nHoliday Money Deals of the Week Free currency exchange card FairFX reader offer Avios point for spending BA Premium Plus 0% currency fees 18.9% (APR) Zero card 0% foreign fees in Europe Current Account 0% foreign fees Free cash abroad Halifax Clarity credit card", "external_links": ["https://www.moneysupermarket.com/credit-cards/details/?productCode=CC_SANTANDER_PURCHASE_CARD&index=88&count=118&selectedProductId=CC_SANTANDER_PURCHASE_CARD&gid=CC_ALLCARDS&page=&source=THISMO12", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/credit-cards/details/?productCode=CC_AMEX_BRIT_AIRPREPLUS&index=7&count=7&selectedProductId=CC_AMEX_BRIT_AIRPREPLUS&gid=CC_ALLCARDS&page=&source=THISMO12", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "http://www.fairfx.com/refer/thisismoneygbp", "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/insurance-finder", "https://www.metrobankonline.co.uk/bank-accounts/products/current-account/", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/credit-cards/details/?productCode=CC_HALIFAX_CLARITY&index=7&count=8&selectedProductId=CC_HALIFAX_CLARITY&gid=CC_LOWRATE&page=&source=THISMO12"], "published": "2017-02-15T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:01:19.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
