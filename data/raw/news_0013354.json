Color was not a part of her classrooms; she had a genuine concern to give each child the tools they needed to excel in the classroom.\"\nColebrooks taught for 31 years at the black elementary school, which is now Poinciana Elementary School, before segregation and retired in 1990 from the old Boynton Elementary School.\nThe Colebrooks' roots go back to the early days of Boynton Beach, according to Janet DeVries, past president of the Boynton Beach Historical Society.\n\"One of the early grave markers in Barton Memorial Park Cemetery is a folk marker for Charla Colebrooks,\" a member of the Colebooks family, she said. \"According to reports by former students, staff and faculty, Ginger Colebrooks was a favorite teacher, as evidenced by comments from both her black and white students.\"\nCaption Spring Break: Let the partying resume Spring Breakers have flocked to Fort Lauderdale since the 1930s and there’s no sign of it ever ending despite the efforts of local leaders and residents\nSpring Breakers have flocked to Fort Lauderdale since the 1930s and there’s no sign of it ever ending despite the efforts of local leaders and residents\nCaption South Florida Dubious History: Railroads dubious history railroads\ndubious history railroads\nColebrooks, who grew up on 11th Avenue, shares her memories of life in Boynton Beach during segregation. She was one of six teachers transferred to the white school in the wake of desegregation.\n\"I was apprehensive, and didn't know what would happen,\" she said. \"I was a good teacher, so it turned out OK. The white school had asked for the best teachers to come and after the teachers integrated, then the students integrated.\"\nHer father was a gardener for a white family from Pittsburgh who had a large house on the beach. Her mother worked as a laundress for the same family.\nBut she has fond memories of growing up in those days. She was athletic and ran track and played softball in high school.\nShe was voted High School Queen –\"Miss Carver High School\" - in the mid-1950s.\n\"I was very active,\" she said. \"I had a great childhood.\"\nShe remembers the \"main drag,\" Main Street with grocery stores, a service station, barber shop and the Club Continental (\"where we went dancing\") and the episcopal church that is still here.\nShe banked at the First Bank & Trust on Federal Highway, the only bank in town, and shopped at a fish market on Ocean Avenue before the bridge. She saw the \"Hopalong Cassidy\" television series at a neighbor's house turned movie theater and watched cowboy movies for 10 cents.\nIf the family wanted to go shopping in West Palm Beach, they would pay a neighbor to take them in his Studebaker or catch the Greyhound Bus on the corner of Federal Highway.\nShe remembers small areas of the beach that were designated for the city's black population.\n\"My dad had a Ford truck,\" Colebrooks said. \"We'd take the neighborhood kids and a barbecue grill and drive to the beach to swim. There was a dividing line between the colored beach and the white beach and we were not allowed to cross that line.\"\nShe remembers that black police officers were not allowed to arrest white suspects.\nA baseball park near the canal was a gathering place on the weekends and she and her friends would go out on a Sunday afternoon to watch the men play softball.\nThe canal was the dividing line between the two communities - the black neighborhood south of the canal and white homes north of the canal.\n\"We were closer back then,\" she said. \"Neighbors watched out for each other. If you were out of place or didn't say the proper things to the elders, any older person could chastise you.\"\n\"We didn't have to lock our doors and I remember the ice man coming by with 50 pounds of ice for the ice box,\" she said. \"He'd come to the back door, put the ice in the ice box and put a pad underneath so it didn't leak on the linoleum.\"\nThe family had a garden and raised chickens in the backyard. There was no indoor plumbing and she remembers dogs roaming freely in the street.\nColebrooks met her first husband, Johnny Davis (Michelle Davis' father), in college at Bethune Cookman University. After she divorced, she married Charles Colebrooks to whom she is still married. The couple had two daughters Charla Allene, who died at 5 months old, and Carla, a teacher at Freedom Shores Elementary School.\nDavis summed up her mother's contributions: \"My mom has been inspirational to both me and my sister and we've both followed in her footsteps, excelling in the classroom as teachers.\"\n\"She is intuitive and that is one of the main ingredients for success in a classroom of eager learners,\" she said.\njengoren@tronc.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5790010a/turbine/fl-dubious-history-railroads", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56d74d6c/turbine/fl-dubious-history-spring-break", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58925e63/turbine/fl-bbf-colebrooks-0208-20170207"], "published": "2017-02-07T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:31:14.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
