Panneerselvam was chosen as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for the third time when Jayalalithaa succumbed to a major cardiac arrest. By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 5, 2017 4:39 PM O Panneerselvan resigns as Tamil Nadu CM. (Source: PTI) \nO. Panneerselvam, a long serving member of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and trusted aide of former Chief Minsiter Jayalalitha resigned from the post of the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister clearing the post for the newly elected Legislative leader Sasikala Natarajan. He took over the post on December 6, 2016 following the sad demise of Jayalalitha and according to the PTI reports, he himself presented Sasikala’s name for the CM post. \nEven though Panneerselvam had started his political journey as a young party activist for DMK in 1969, he came into the limelight when he was elected as the chairman of Periyakulam Municipality in 1996. However, fulfilling his responsibilities till 2001, he was elected to contest elections for AIADMK from the Periyakulam Assembly constituency and won. \nYou may also want to watch: \n\nHe was seubsenquently appointed the Revenue Minister in Jayalalithaa’s government and held the office from 19 May 2001 to 1 September 2001. When the then party supremo had to step down from the CM post due after she was convicted in the TANSI land scam, she named O Panneerselvam to take office in her place. \nFollwing the footsteps of ‘Bharat’ from Ramayan, Panneerselvam never sat on the CM chair during his 6-month tenure. He had his fair share of criticism as people labelled it a ‘puppet government’. In 2002, Jayalalithaa returned to office forcing Panneerselvam to serve as the Minister for Public Works, Prohibition, and Excise for the coming years. \nHowever, he once again took the position of Tamil Nadu CM on September 27, 2014 when Jayalalitha was convicted in the disproportionate assets case. When Jayalalithaa won the elections for record sixth time in 2016, he was appointed as the Finance Minister in the Cabinet. \nIn December 2016, Panneerselvam was chosen as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for the third time when Jayalalithaa succumbed to a major cardiac arrest. And, as it tunred out he resigned from the post today, on February 5.
