Pin \nAbigail goes to Dario at TBD. He hasn't found Chad and Gabi. She shows him the list of all Titan properties nearby and tells him to do whatever it takes to bring them home. Dario makes a call and hears someone he knows is protecting an abandoned warehouse. He takes off, asking her not to follow, but she does. \nAt Salem Inn, Sonny frees himself and goes at the goon, who smacks him around until he's unconscious. \nFrom the Kiriakis mansion, Deimos leaves a message for Nicole, promising to get Holly back for her. Eduardo and Andre walk in and agree it's devastating when a loved one is taken. Deimos realizes they took Sonny. They want peace and ask him to release Chad and Gabi and they'll release Sonny. Deimos won't release them without the key but they don't have it. \nDrew calls his twin brother Shane from the alley, asking for help. Shane's happy to hear from Drew, surprised he's in Salem. Drew says if he ends up dead to tell Roman to arrest Deimos Kiriakis. He disconnects, leaving Shane at a loss for words. When Drew is gone, Paul and JJ talk about hoping it's not too late to save Sonny. JJ gets a call about a commotion at Salem Inn. \nIn the closet where they're being held, Gabi and Chad make out, half naked. \nJennifer's dragged inside the Kiriakis mansion. Eddie questions if she has the key. She stalls. Drew turns up. Eddie and Andre ask who the hell he is. \"I'm the key,\" he states. Eddie looks upwards as if looking to God and shakes his head. Drew claims he's ready to do what's necessary so Deimos gets the drive for him. Deimos gives him a laptop and Drew installs the virus which deletes all the files. \"Is that supposed to happen?\" Deimos asks. \"It should have happened a long time ago,\" Drew says. \"I've created it and now I've...uncreated it,\" he shrugs. Roman and two cops interrupt. Shane called about a possible 911 situation. He wants to hear what's going on and about where Chad and Gabi are being held. Deimos claims he doesn't know where they are. They all head to SPD. \nDario finds Deimos' goon at the park. They're friends so Dario asks him to tell him where Gabi and Chad are. The man feels bad. He wouldn't have taken the job if he had known who they were. Dario runs to find them with Abby trailing him. \nMore: Days' Camila Banus' role in Almost Amazing \nIn the meat locker, Gabi can't think straight and asks where they are. Chad thinks they are in Chicago ice skating. They kiss. He tells her how beautiful she is. They hallucinate some more and then pass out. Abigail bursts in and sees them half nude and barely breathing. She's startled but quickly starts CPR on Chad, begging him to breathe. He starts breathing and Dario grabs Gabi. \nJustin meets Adrienne in the square. When he has no news about Sonny, they head out together. \nAt SPD, Deimos keeps telling the cops he's innocent. \nAt Salem Inn, while Paul releases Sonny, the goon hears a noise and opens the door, finding Sonny gone. JJ pulls a gun and the goon grabs it and throws JJ against the wall. Suddenly, Paul and Sonny come out of hiding and knock out the goon. \nAt the hospital, Abigail and Dario hear that Chad and Gabi will make a full recovery, though they're still unconscious. Abigail pauses when the doctor says she can go in. Dario knows it's because they were found nearly naked. Abby says they could have been conserving heat but wonders if she's just being naive. She visits Chad and cries, holding his hand. She's angry with him - not about Gabi but because she almost lost him. Meanwhile, Dario apologizes to Gabi for not protecting her better. Dario goes to visit Chad, who says Gabi's name while Abigail goes to see Gabi. \nBack at SPD, Roman tells Drew and Jenn that Sonny, Chad and Gabi have all been found and are fine. Drew curses himself for creating the Orwell, which was the cause of all of this. Drew can't wait to see Camilla. First, he wants to visit the meat locker Gabi and Chad were held in. Meanwhile, Deimos is released and is pissed that Andre and Eddie cost him a lot. Andre tells Eduardo he'll bury him and then goes. \nNew: This week's Daytime Talk Show guest list: Jennifer Lopez on Ellen, Malin Akerman on The Talk \nJenn and Drew arrive at the meat locker. Drew reveals he never really deleted the Orwell software entirely. He shows her a back up in a bag. They run over to the alley where they take cover. An explosion is heard nearby. Now there's no back up. \nBack at the hospital, Adrienne and Justin rush into Sonny's arms. They thank Paul for finding him. He's been given the all clear by the doctor and privately, Sonny tells Paul that he's taking over the Kiriakis family and he'll take his revenge on Deimos his way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:24:43.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
