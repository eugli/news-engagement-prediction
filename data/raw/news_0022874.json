Getty Images 3 Manchester United have made Antoine Griezmann their number one transfer target this summer \nThe club have even indicated they would be willing to hand the French midfielder the number seven shirt – worn by his idol David Beckham. \nBut Atleti president Cerezo claims United will be disappointed in their pursuit of Griezmann because the player will be staying with the La Liga club. EFE Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo insists Antoine Griezmann will not be sold this summer \nCerezo said: Every time I see Antoine I give him a hug. \n“Antoine is a fantastic player and loves life at Atletico. \n“I don’t know what Manchester United’s interest is but Griezmann will be at Atletico for a long time” \nDespite the claims of Cerezo, United remain confident they can get the deal over the line this summer and have the finances to pay what Atleti are wanting. \nGriezmann only signed an improved contract last summer which doesn’t expire until 2021, so the Spanish club know they are in a strong position as a selling club. Getty Images Antoine Griezmann could wear the number seven shirt if he joins Manchester United Female Manchester United fan sings tribute song to the Busby Babes \nCerezo's public stance is seen by United as little more than an attempt to force the asking price up, with Griezmann having a release clause in his contract of around £90m. \nAtletic would prefer thee fee to rise higher than the £60m figure currently on the table, though they know the player is keen to move on this summer. latest football news anfield shake up Liverpool will offload Daniel Sturridge and replace Simon Mignolet with Joe Hart as Klopp plans huge squad shake up 'Spineless' Chelsea legend slams Arsenal fans and tells them to get behind 'stale' Arsene Wenger in incredible attack DON'T RISK IT Hector Bellerin should not be rushed back by after horror head clash, urge brain injury campaigners 'They're not out of sight' Liverpool can still catch leaders Chelsea despite 13-point gap, claims John Barnes extreme courting Thibaut Courtois' agent 'is ringing Real Madrid EVERY DAY to try and sort a summer switch' in demand Arsenal and Chelsea to battle PSG and Bayern Munich in summer race to sign Atletico Madrid star Yannick Carrasco LUKING AT ROM Chelsea old boy Romelu Lukaku tops Conte's summer wish-list along with Valencia's Joao Cancelo KEEP THE FAITH Gabriel Jesus WON'T be able to keep up star performances, warns Manchester City team-mate Fernandinho 'NOT JUST ANY CLUB' Henrikh Mkhitaryan may have mastered SIX languages but all he cares about is loving Man United LION IN WAIT Andy Carroll set for England recall with Gareth Southgate due to watch in-form ace against West Brom at weekend TEAM NEWS Liverpool vs Spurs: Danny Rose and Jan Vertonghen set to miss the clash, while Dejan Lovren is a doubt Team news West Ham vs West Brom: What is the team news, what time is it, what TV channel is it on?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T16:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:02:24.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
