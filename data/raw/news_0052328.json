The incident, involving an unknown woman, was captured in London on the GoPro camera of a following motorcyclist, who is later heard telling the occupants of the van that they got what “you deserve”. \nThe footage begins after the van pulls up next to the cyclist at a red light. \nThe passenger then asks the woman: “Alright, want my number?” \nThe cyclist seems unimpressed and pushes her hand against the side of the van, which the man says is “not very lady like”. \nHe then continues: “What charm school did you go to?” \nIn a final insult before the light go green, the man adds: “Shut up you old dog, you on your period?”. He then tries to touch her shoulder, as the cyclist makes an ‘up yours’ hand gesture. \nThe van is then seen disappearing into the distance, but the cyclist doggedly pursues it. \nWhen the van pulls over to the side of the road, the woman stops beside it, and using both arms, tears the wing mirror off, before continuing on her way. \nThe following motorcyclist then pulls up alongside the van and tells the occupants: “That’s exactly what you deserve, you scum!” More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:42:21.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
