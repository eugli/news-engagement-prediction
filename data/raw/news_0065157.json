Two of our recommended nonfiction works this week, Richard Haass’s “A World in Disarray” and Pankaj Mishra’s “The Age of Anger,” fit that bill admirably. Of course, if what you hunger for is escape from anger and disarray, you can always get lost in a novel: this week’s fiction will take you from a railroad in Kenya to a video store (remember video stores?) in Iowa to a mysterious disappearance in Greece. A WORLD IN DISARRAY: American Foreign Policy and the Crisis of the Old Order , by Richard Haass. (Penguin Press, $28.) In his timely new book, Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, offers a look at the current state of world affairs. Our critic Michiko Kakutani called it “a primer that concerned citizens of all political persuasions — not to mention the president and his advisers — could benefit from reading.” THE DARK FLOOD RISES , by Margaret Drabble. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) This masterly novel by one of Britain’s most dazzling writers follows its 70-something heroine, Fran, on a road trip through England checking out housing options for the elderly. “Fran is an unwitting Virgil who leads us through the circles of the hell of aging,” writes Cynthia Ozick in our review. “But it is a hell where pragmatic thoughtfulness reigns and functional architecture is sustenance.” AGE OF ANGER: A History o f t he Present , by Pankaj Mishra. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $27.) This important, erudite book probes the deepest roots of our inflamed moment. Mishra argues that broad swaths of the globe are reliving the traumas and violent dislocations that accompanied Europe’s transition to modernity in the 18th and 19th centuries. DANCE OF THE JAKARANDA , by Peter Kimani. (Akashic, paper, $15.95.) This funny, perceptive and ambitious work of historical fiction by a Kenyan poet and novelist explores his country’s colonial past and its legacy through the stories of three men involved with the building of a railroad linking Lake Victoria and the Indian Ocean — what the Kikuyu called the “Iron Snake” and the British called the “Lunatic Express.” Photo THE REFUGEES , by Viet Thanh Nguyen. (Grove, $25.) This superb collection of stories by the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel “The Sympathizer” concerns men and women displaced from wartime Saigon and (mostly) settled in California. Its subjects are the aftershocks of war and the pain of migration — a pain that, in Nguyen’s telling, is as much physical as psychological. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story UNIVERSAL HARVESTER , by John Darnielle. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) In Iowa in the late 1990s, someone is inserting disturbing scenes into rental videotapes (remember videotapes?) and store employees set out to investigate. But this novel of suspense by the lead songwriter for the Mountain Goats is also a graceful exploration of family, loss and rural life. DEAR FRIEND, FROM MY LIFE I WRITE TO YOU IN YOUR LIFE , by Yiyun Li. (Random House, $27.) Born and raised in China, Li came to the United States to study immunology but changed course after one part-time writing class. Her autobiographical essays capture her difficult childhood, her transformation into a fiction writer and the personal unraveling that came with success in her adopted language. A SEPARATION , by Katie Kitamura. (Riverhead, $25.) Deceptions pile on deceptions in this coolly unsettling postmodern mystery, in which a British woman travels to a Greek fishing village to search for her estranged husband, who has disappeared. A dead body ensues (we won’t say whose), but “once you begin to pick at the seams,” we are told, “all deaths are unresolved.” A version of this list appears in print on February 26, 2017, on Page BR23 of the Sunday Book Review .
