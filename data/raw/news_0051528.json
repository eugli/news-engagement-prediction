He rejects the charges against him as politically motivated. \nThe CNRP's 55 lawmakers boycotted the National Assembly vote on Monday, saying it had targeted them. But Hun Sen's party has a slim majority in parliament so it was able to pass the change. \nWelcoming the change to the election rules, ruling party lawmaker Chheang Vun said it would allow the interior ministry to start closing some of Cambodia's 76 political parties. He said only 45 were properly registered. \nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations Parliamentarians for Human Rights group called it the \"death knell for democracy\" in Cambodia. \nNew York-based advocacy group Human Rights Watch said it marked the consolidation of absolute power. \n\"Cambodia will become a sham democracy going forward,\" said Phil Robertson, the group's Deputy Asia Director. \"The silence of foreign governments and aid donors to this move has been profoundly disheartening.\" \nCambodia has been transformed during Hun Sen's rule from what was essentially a failed state after decades of conflict. \n(Editing by Matthew Tostevin & Simon Cameron-Moore) Next In World News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T13:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:55:29.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
