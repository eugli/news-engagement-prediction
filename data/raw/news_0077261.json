Most Popular NTSB: No mechanical failure in crashed plane \nDr. Abram Handly-Santana, a researcher who specializes in pancreatic cancer at Cold Spring Harbor Lab, attributes much of the cancer’s poor survival rate to the structural makeup of the tumor’s outer shell. This enclosure, known as a stroma, might as well be armor because its presence has made it nearly impossible for cancer-killing drugs to penetrate, Handly-Santana said. \n“The stroma in pancreatic cancer has always been a poignant target for researchers because it has made treatment very difficult,” Handly-Santana said, noting that the deadly barrier has long proved an enigma for both doctors who treat patients and scientists who study the cancer’s biology. \nThe wall is so tough, Handly-Santana added, that some cancer clinical trials involving experimental medications designed to breach the barrier, had to be abandoned midstream. The drugs were so harsh they further sickened already ailing patients, he said.

In so doing they have found a possible new target — a doorway through the stroma — to reach the cancer. That vulnerability, he said, is made up of fibroblast cells, a main contributor to the stroma. \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \n“The stroma is not as well understood as many researchers thought it was. So we are trying to enlighten the field, and the better we understand it, the better we can target it in the future,” Handly-Santana said. \nHe and Giulia Biffi, Daniel Ohlund and 18 other Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory scientists helped make the discovery and reported their results in the current issue of the Journal of Experimental Medicine. They used tiny 3D organoids, miniature balloon-like structures in a sea of gelatinous goo to zero in on stroma’s structure. \nDr. Craig Devoe, acting chief of hematology and oncology at Northwell Health’s Monter Cancer Center in New Hyde Park, said the stroma has long been known as an inhibitor to drug penetration in pancreatic cancer. \nThe structure not only blocks the uptake of medication but also increases pressure around the tumor, Devoe said.
