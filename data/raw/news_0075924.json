The album will be an extension of that. Even if it’s not quite satisfactory, the members are trying to release music that they had a hand in writing,” the source explained. \nThe source continued, saying, “The lyrics will be written by all the members including Jung Chaeyeon. Huihyeon, Eunice, and Yebin will be participating in writing the music. We have expectations for them as they all know how to play instruments.” \nStay tuned for more updates!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:07:49.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
