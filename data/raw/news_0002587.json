They were still gunned down.\"\nAmnesty also said officers planted evidence and falsified reports to \"cover their tracks\".\nThe rights group said there appeared to be financial incentives for the killings, with one officer claiming they were given an \"under the table\" payment for each death, as well as payments from some funeral homes.\nRaffy Lerma is a photo-journalist documenting the nightly killings The rights group said the vast majority of those killed were poor and on \"drug watch lists\" prepared by government officials and shared with police.\nIt said the lists were \"deeply problematic\" and that names could be put on it \"based on hearsay and community rumour or rivalry, with little to no verification\".\nThe group spoke to 110 people for the report including witnesses of killings, victims' relatives, drug users, police officers, and members of government, civil society and religious groups.\nMr Duterte admitted the police force is \"corrupt to the core\" earlier this week Mr Duterte has come under heavy criticism from rights groups and Western countries for his hardline stance on drugs.\nBut the shocking and high-profile kidnap and murder of the South Korean businessman prompted Mr Duterte to admit that the police is \"corrupt to the core\" and he suspended the drug war with all anti-drug units dissolved and ordered a re-organisation of their ranks.\nHe has in the past sanctioned extra-judicial killings by the police, saying he would pardon them for such acts, and once said he would be \"happy to slaughter\" three million drug addicts.", "external_links": ["http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/philippines_ejk_report_v19_final_0.pdf", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-36659258", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/C1E4/production/_93863694_b145c0e3-8af6-4e04-99fd-6afbe7da9237.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2647/production/_93899790_d143ede3-5b0f-4ade-9b6a-3f6aa4042753.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-38686990", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-37192859", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-37172002"], "published": "2017-02-01T09:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T11:56:55.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
