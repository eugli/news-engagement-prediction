(Photo: Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY NETWORK) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWell, that's not your usual host introduction. \nCBS late-night star James Corden tripped off his first Grammy hosting gig by actually tripping, spilling down a brightly lit staircase and right into a big dance production number that he quickly shut down, chastising all involved for their ineptitude. \n\"Stop! This is a disaster,\" he said, shooing away his backup dancers as part of a well-choreographed display of ineptitude. \"We cannot allow these sorts of mistakes, can we? This is the Grammys, people.\" \nThen Corden, now wearing just one shoe and probably deserving of stunt-man pay after his fall, broke into a Grammys-inspired rap that at first seemed to draw looks of puzzlement, judging from the looks on the faces of stars in the Staples Center audience. \nThe CBS Late Late Show host, a Tony winner with singing and dancing chops who made Carpool Karaoke a viral phenomenon, played down his music cred with the rap line: \"I'm in over my head, just not that strong/I'm on at 12:30/prime-time it's just wrong.\" \nThe rap name-dropped Adele, whose show-opening performance of Hello was pretty much an impossible act to follow, gained crowd support with plentiful name-dropping — Adele, Beyonce and her pregnancy with twins, Lady Gaga, Rihanna Drake, Bruno Mars — and got huge applause with a reference to President Trump. \n“Live it all up, because this is the best/But with President Trump we don’t know what comes next.” Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2l59GvT NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
