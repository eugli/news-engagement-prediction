A suicide bomber detonated a pick-up truck on Wednesday in Sadr City, a heavily populated poor suburb of Baghdad, killing at least 15 and wounding 50, security sources said. The explosion, the deadliest in Baghdad so far this year, targeted a crowded street full of garages and used car dealers. Daesh has stepped up bombings in Iraq last year, in retaliation to a U.S.-backed campaign that dislodged the hardline group from most Iraqi cities it took over in 2014. The militants also control parts of neighbouring Syria. Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T17:52:34.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
