Dan Marino (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:37 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 6:37 p.m. ET \nThe Dolphins signed a pair of veteran quarterbacks Wednesday. Don't worry, Ryan Tannehill, your job is safe. \nHall of Fame quarterbacks Dan Marino and Bob Griese were among six former Dolphins players signed to one-day contracts Wednesday so they can officially retire as members of the team. Also signed Wednesday were Hall of Fame guard Larry Little, former linebacker Kim Bokamper, ex-cornerback Sam Madison and former receiver Nat Moore. \n\"These six former players are being added to the active roster to further emphasize the bond between the organization and the team’s alumni, who helped established the rich legacy of the Miami Dolphins,\" the team said in a statement . A few familiar names return to the roster... pic.twitter.com/iy7LwQfWgO — Miami Dolphins (@MiamiDolphins) February 22, 2017 \nIt's sort of a strange tribute because four of the six players spent their entire careers with the Dolphins. Only Little, whose first two seasons were spent with the Chargers, and Madison, who played the final three seasons of a 12-year career with the Giants, were with other teams. \n\"In this day and age, we try to get players to retire as Dolphins,\" executive vice president of football operations Mike Tannenbaum said during the signing ceremony. \"This means a lot to us, our legacy. We’re all so proud of it and all the contributions you guys have made, it means a lot to all of us. We thank you guys and we’re proud that you’re Dolphins.\" \nThe six players combined for two NFL MVP awards — Griese in 1971 and Marino in 1984 — 14 first-team All-Pros selections and 25 Pro Bowl invitations. \nGriese helped lead the Dolphins to their only two Super Bowl championships during their undefeated 1972 season and again in 1973. \nMarino retired as the NFL's all-time leader in passing yards, completions, attempts and touchdowns — and remains among the top five all time in each of those categories. It's official! I'm back on the @MiamiDolphins active team roster for the day with some of my former teammates. #FinsUp pic.twitter.com/ErNmECcpYR — Dan Marino (@DanMarino) February 22, 2017 \nMoore, who caught 510 passes for 7,546 yards and 74 touchdowns over 13 seasons, is still employed by the Dolphins as their senior vice president of special projects and alumni relations. \n\"It’s part of the long bond that they’ve had with former players,\" Moore said Wednesday. \"The Miami Dolphins alumni are probably at the forefront of the league with the interaction between organization and the former players and this is just another step in that direction. \n\"At this late date to be called in, have a chance to sign a contract for a day …. the time I spent here playing for the Dolphins being a part of this organization matters. For me, today is a fun day and a chance to reflect back when I played and guys I played with.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:52:11.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
