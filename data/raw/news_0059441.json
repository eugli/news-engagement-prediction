Hoversurf, the Russian-based company unveiled their latest product called the Scorpio-3. It is a hovering machine that combines the features of a quadcopter drone with a bike. It is a single-seat, electric-powered hoverbike that is intended to be an extreme sports instrument. The company Hoversurf says, Scorpio - 3 is the world's first electric hoverbike that's intended to be \"an extreme sports instrument\" for both \"amateur and professional navigators\", according to a report in The Verge . The hoverbike's range and velocity are limited as it is said to run on custom-made software. Hoversurf says that the Scorpio-3's design was \"inspired by heavy-duty sport-utility motorbike frames that basically surfs through the air by changing altitude and direction\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:21:34.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
