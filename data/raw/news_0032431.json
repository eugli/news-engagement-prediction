Mike Ilitch (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 11:21 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 11:21 a.m. ET \nJames Dolan lately has been giving owners a bad name. Unfortunately, someone who gave them a good name passed away last week. \nBut if you still wonder if you should stop expecting anything more from your favorite team owner than to not have a franchise favorite dragged out of the arena in handcuffs, you can still remember Mike Ilitch fondly. \nThe former owner of the Tigers and Red Wings, whose public viewing was Wednesday at the downtown Detroit Fox Theatre that he brought back to life, treated legends much better than that. \nIlitch paid Rosa Parks’ rent for the last 11 years of her life. \nMORE: Dolan's place on list of worst owners ever \nWhen Ilitch died Friday, the story Ilitch never publicized, and which only was told by a third party only three years ago — long after Parks died in 2005 — was brought blooming back to life. \nThe original story was told in 2014 in the Sports Business Journal (owned by the company that previously owned Sporting News). \nIlitch himself, though, never sought attention for it, by all accounts. \nMichigan lieutenant-governor Brian Calley posted about it on Facebook last Saturday, to illustrate, he said, \"the kind of man Mike Ilitch was.\" \nParks, whose refusal to move to the back of a Montgomery, Ala., bus in 1955 was the catalyst for the Martin Luther King-led bus boycott that started the modern civil rights movement, had been robbed and beaten in her Detroit home in August 1994. She was 81 then, and the crime horrified much of the nation. \nIlitch, the story said, immediately made arrangements to find Parks a safer place to live in the city, found her an apartment … then kept paying the rent until her death. \nOnly those directly in the know were aware of it until nearly a decade later — when federal judge Damon Keith displayed one of Ilitch’s checks, calling it “symbolic of what he has always done for the people of our city.\" \nThat’s part of a long list, including the restoration of the Fox Theatre, building Comerica Park to replace Tiger Stadium, giving the Big Three auto companies free ad space in the ballpark, renovating Joe Louis Arena for the Red Wings, building a new downtown arena for both the Wings and Pistons (to bring them in from the suburbs after nearly 40 years), and starting or contributing to charities all over the still-struggling city. \nMORE: All-time greatest Red Wings \nGiving Rosa Parks a safe place to live out her final years is hard to top, though. \nAnd this is not to say either that Ilitch was the only obscenely-rich sports owner (the family net worth is reportedly $6.1 billion) to be this charitable, particularly away from the cameras … or that Dolan and Madison Square Garden are not generous, too. \nIlitch, however, never made a public fool of himself, trashed his enemies, capriciously made enemies or tried cheap ploys to insulate himself from condemnation. The degrading way he co-opted other Knicks favorites like Latrell Sprewell and Bernard King in Sunday’s nationally-televised game comes to mind. \nNo commissioner ever had to come and stage an intervention with Ilitch to spare further embarrassment and condemnation for his franchise or the league, as Adam Silver had to do this week. \nLosing teams are hard enough to swallow; the Tigers under Ilitch weren’t all that lovable during the lean years, for certain. But chronically boorish behavior is unforgivable. That’s not how Ilitch ever handled himself. \nDetroit fans will be showing their love this week before Ilitch is laid to rest. An embrace that big from a city for a team owner is not the norm. Ilitch wasn’t the norm. \nThankfully, neither is Dolan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T18:33:24.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
