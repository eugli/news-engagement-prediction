External Link: Briggs tweet: Goodnight Melton, there will be no encore! \n\"Sydney, you wanted the best but they're stuck in traffic, so here's what you get,\" he yelled, before introducing the band. \nThe mistake could have been forgiven the last time the band performed in Melbourne in 2013, given the venue was the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. \nThe three founding members - Axl Rose, Slash and Duff McKagan - had not played together for Australian fans since the 1993 Use Your Illusion Tour. \nThe band was quick to apologise on Twitter: External Link: Guns N' Roses tweet: Melbourne! Accidentally after 30 years McBob made an error, we're truly sorry. Thank you for coming out tonight! \nLead guitarist Slash also followed up with a more colourful response. \nHe tweeted: \"Melbourne, thank you for an awesome f***ing evening! Apologies for the Spinal Tap intro! But, we had a great f***ing time tonight! Cheers!\" \nAmong the thousands of fans at last night's show were a married couple who walked down the aisle to November Rain, and a Catholic school attendee who had prayed in communion for Slash and Axl Rose to reunite. \nGuns N' Roses will wrap up their Australian tour in Adelaide on Saturday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:06:03.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
