What pH Means Litmus paper is a type of pH paper that is used to test the acidity of water-based liquids. David Gould, Getty Images Updated November 30, 2015 . Question: What Does pH Stand For? \nHave you ever wondered what pH stands for or where the term originated? Here is the answer to the question and a look at the history of the pH scale . \nAnswer: pH is the negative log of hydrogen ion concentration in a water-based solution. The term \"pH\" was first described by Danish biochemist Søren Peter Lauritz Sørensen in 1909. pH is an abbreviation for \"power of hydrogen\" where \"p\" is short for the German word for power, potenz and H is the element symbol for hydrogen . The H is capitalized because it is standard to capitalize element symbols . The abbreviation also works in French, with pouvoir hydrogen translating as \"the power of hydrogen\". Logarithmic Scale \nThe pH scale is a logarithmic scale that usually runs from 1 to 14. Each whole pH value below 7 (the pH of pure water ) is ten times more acidic than the higher value and each whole pH value above 7 is ten times less acidic than the one below it. For example, a pH of 3 is ten times more acidic than a pH of 4 and 100 times (10 times 10) more acidic than a pH value of 5. \ncontinue reading below our video 10 Best Universities in the United States So, a strong acid may have a pH of 1-2, while a strong base may have a pH of 13-14. A pH near 7 is considered to be neutral. Equation for pH \npH is the logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration of an aqueous (water-based) solution: \npH = -log[H+] \nlog is the base 10 logarithm and [H+] is hydrogen ion concentration in the units moles per liter \nIt's important to keep in mind a solution must be aqueous to have a pH. You cannot, for example, calculation pH of vegetable oil or pure ethanol.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:48:42.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
