What constitutes “adverse information” is not defined in the bill.\nThe minister can consider public health and safety, national security, Australia’s economic wellbeing or the circumstances in a person’s home country when making a revalidation decision.\nThe bill gives examples of a person being required to revalidate their visa because they:\nHold a particular passport Live in a particular country Live in a particular state or province within a country May have travelled through a particular area at a particular time However, there are no parameters guiding the minister’s determination of a specific class of person, and concerns have been raised that it could be broadly imposed on people of certain ethnicities, or religious or political affiliations.\nWhen the bill went before a Senate committee last year, every submission – except for the department’s own – said the powers were unjustified and liable to exploitation.\nThe Migration Institute of Australia said the bill had the potential to give the minister “ unfettered power ” over who held a visa in Australia.\n“At worst, the minister’s powers could be used to significantly skew this interpretation of the ‘public interest’... this could be extrapolated to discriminate against large numbers of long-term visa holders lawfully living in Australia.” \nThe Law Council of Australia said the bill was “neither necessary nor proportionate to its intended objective” and that it gave the minister a broad range of powers “with limited or no explanation as to their intended purpose” and without parliamentary oversight.\nThe Andrew and Renata Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law at the University of New South Wales said refugees could be adversely affected by the proposed bill, and that it gave “ excessive powers ” to the minister without any definition of what the “public interest” should be.\nThe Department of Immigration and Border Protection defended the proposed powers, saying the revalidation powers were drafted broadly in order to allow the minister to act in the national interest . Parliament would have oversight of the revalidation orders, the department said.\nThe Senate committee ultimately recommended the bill be passed .\nDutton told ABC’s AM radio program that Labor had no objection to the bill, including at the Senate committee, until the last 24 hours and labelled the opposition’s tactics a “mendacious” distraction.\nManus Island detention centre on high alert after escape during deportation attempt Read more \n“What we’ve said is during that period [of holding a visa] if somebody, for example, commits a criminal offence or they are put on a terrorist watchlist then we reserve the right to go back and have look at their details and stop them from coming to our country.”\nDutton said it was “rubbish” that there was no parliamentary oversight because the Senate could disallow the regulation.\nGreens senator Nick McKim, who issued the only dissenting statement from the Senate committee report last year, told the Guardian the proposed ministerial powers were “an attack on multicultural Australia”.\nLabor cannot give Trump-like powers to a man that has such a high desire to see a divided Australia\nShayne Neumann \n“We would urge the parliament not to give Peter Dutton the ‘extreme vetting’ powers that he wants, that would give him the ability to target nationalities, ethnic or cultural groups.”\nLabor has similarly vowed to oppose the bill. The party’s immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, told parliament: “Labor cannot give Trump-like powers to a man that has such a high desire to see a divided Australia.\n“Labor won’t support a bill that could see whole groups of people targeting based on their place of birth, passport or religion. This minister cannot be trusted with wide-ranging, unfettered powers over the visas of whole groups of people.”\nThe bill passed the House of Representatives Thursday, but will face more opposition in the Senate, where the vote is expected to be extremely close.\nIf Labor and the Greens vote against the bill, the Coalition will require nine of 10 crossbenchers to vote in favour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:01:45.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
