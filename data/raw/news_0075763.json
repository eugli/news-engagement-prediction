Called KEYone, for BlackBerry this phone marks a return to its roots. Once again. The KEYone -- it was earlier known with its codename called Mercury -- comes with a physical keyboard, which made BlackBerry a household name around a decade ago. But unlike the old BlackBerry phones, the new one comes with a large screen. Also Read: BlackBerry Mercury KEYone launched with physical QWERTY and Pixel-like camera The KEYone is also a phone made by BlackBerry's new hardware partner TCL. It is also, in all likelihood, the last BlackBerry phone with a physical keyboard. India Today Tech will have more to say about the KEYone in the coming days, but for now if you are wondering what the phone is all about read on: Specifications \nProcessor: Although KEYone is a high-end phone and looks very premium, it uses Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor, which is usually meant for mainstream phones. For example, the Redmi Note 4 uses the same processor. \nRAM: 3GB \nInternal storage: 32GB. Option to add a microSD card of up to 2TB has been provided. \nScreen: The KEYone has a 4.5-inch screen with FullHD (1080) display. Although the exact resolution is 1620x1080 that is lower than what we associate with FullHD (1920 X 1080). \nRear camera: The KEYone uses a 12-megapixel camera. BlackBerry says the image sensor behind the camera has large pixels, which should help the phone click good photos even in low light. Interestingly, this seems to be the same camera that is inside Google Pixel phones. So, the KEYone could be one of the best when it comes to clicking photos. The phone has a lens with aperture of F2.0. \nFront camera: 8-megapixel camera with F2.2 aperture lens \nWeight: 180 grams, which is on the heavier side. \nSoftware: Android Nougat customised with BlackBerry's security-related tweaks. \nBattery: 3,505 mAh with quick charging. BlackBerry calls the feature \"boost,\" which puts the phone in battery saving mode while charging, so it charges even faster. Special features \nLike all BlackBerry phones, the KEYone too has several unique features. \n-- The top unique feature of the KEYone is its keyboard. Under the screen the phone has a physical keyboard, which is a rarity in a smartphone these days. But the keyboard could appeal to BlacKBerry's old fans. \n-- Each key in the keyboard is customisable. So users will be able to create their own shortcuts. \n-- The screen of the KEYone has aspect ratio of 3:2 and that would make browsing or reading an email a nice experience on this phone. Watching videos? May be not so much. \n-- Although the KEYone uses Android Nougat, it has a number of unique security features aimed at BlackBerry's enterprise customers. \nAvailability: The KEYone will go on sale in April. Around the same time, it is also expected to come to India. Also Read: It was a mistake to launch Priv in isolation: BlackBerry \nIndia price: The global price for the KEYone is $549. However, in Europe it will cost Euro 599 and in the UK its cost is Pound 499. In India, with taxes etc included, the price of the KEYone could be as high as Rs 50,000. In any case, it won't cost less than Rs 40,000.
