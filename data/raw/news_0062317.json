Plenty. \nA college master's degree is worth an average of $1.3 million more in lifetime earnings than a high school diploma, according to a recent report from the U.S. Census Bureau . \nThe report titled \"The Big Payoff: Educational Attainment and Synthetic Estimates of Work-Life Earnings\" (.pdf) reveals that over an adult's working life, high school graduates can expect, on average, to earn $1.2 million, while those with a bachelor's degree will earn, $2.1 million; and people with a master's degree will earn $2.5 million. \n\"The large differences in average work-life earnings among the educational levels reflect both differential starting salaries and also disparate earnings trajectories,\" noted the Census Bureau, \"that is, the path of earnings over oneâ€™s life.\" Persons with doctoral degrees earn an average of $3.4 million during their working life, while those with professional degrees, like medicine, law, and engineering do best at $4.4 million. \"At most ages, more education equates with higher earnings, and the payoff is most notable at the highest educational levels,\" said Jennifer Cheeseman Day, co-author of the report.The figures are based on 1999 earnings projected over a typical work life, defined by the Census Bureau as the period from ages 25 through 64. \n\"While many people stop working at an age other than 65, or start before age 25, this range of 40 years provides a practical benchmark for many people,\" noted the Census Bureau. Americans Staying In School Longer \nAlong with the financial data, the report also shows that more Americans are staying in school longer than ever before. In 2000, as 84% of American adults age 25 and over had at least completed high school and 26% had continued to earn a bachelor's degree or higher, both percentages all-time highs. 'Glass Ceiling' On Earnings Still Intact \nThe report also shows that while more American women than men have received bachelor's degrees every year since 1982, men with professional degrees may expect to cumulatively earn almost $2 million more than their female counterparts over their work lives. Glass ceiling aside, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that women who graduated from college earned about 76 percent more than women with only a high school diploma in 2004.Additional highlights from the report show: In 1999, average annual earnings ranged from $18,900 for high school dropouts to $25,900 for high school graduates, $45,400 for college graduates and $99,300 for the holders of professional degrees ( medical doctors , dentists, veterinarians, and lawyers). Over a work life, earnings for a worker with a bachelor's degree compared with one who had just a high school diploma increase by about $1 million for non-Hispanic Whites and about $700,000 for African Americans; Asians and Pacific Islanders; and Hispanics. Currently, almost 9-in-10 young adults graduate from high school and about 6-in-10 high school seniors go on to college the following year. \nA separate report released last year, \"What's It Worth? Field of Training and Economic Status: 1996,\" said among people with bachelor's degrees, those working full time in engineering earned the highest average monthly pay ($4,680), while those with education degrees earned the lowest ($2,802) in 1996.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:17:45.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
