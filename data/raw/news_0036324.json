Kelley, Jonathan Shapiro and Ross Fineman. In addition to the imminent launch of his HBO limited series Big Little Lies , Kelley is also writing the series adaptation of Stephen King's Mr. Mercedes , which is set to bow later this year on the AT&T Audience Network. \n“Amazon is proud of Goliath and Billy Bob’s amazing, Golden Globe-winning performance,” said Amazon Studios' head of comedy, drama and VR Joe Lewis. “Great shows like this help elevate the art of storytelling. We can’t wait to bring our customers a new season soon.\" So far, Thornton is the only confirmed returning star for season two. Season one boasted an impressive cast that included William Hurt, Maria Bello, Olivia Thirlby and Molly Parker, among others. However, when speaking with THR in October shortly before the series debut, Kelley confirmed that only \"some\" castmembers would return for the second season. \"It would definitely be a new case,\" he said. \"There are other cases that come behind it.\" \nAt the time, Kelley was also open about his original three-season plan for the series. \"We originally thought three years, that would be great. It could go more; it could go less.\" \nFor Amazon, the renewal is not surprising. The first-ever series to get a straight-to-series order and skip Amazon's pilot-voting process, Goliath became the most binged show on the platform within its first month of release. The project has also proven to be an awards contender for Amazon, with Thornton winning the Golden Globe award for best actor in a drama series in January. \nGoliath joins fellow Amazon dramas Bosch, Man in the High Castle, Sneaky Pete and Z: The Beginning of Everything . Upcoming drama series include Patriot, The Last Tycoon and Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan. \nIn addition to serving as showrunner on Dexter 's first four season, Phillips' credits include Nurse Jackie and, most recently, AMC's Feed the Beast.
