He then put her in a towel and tied the umbilical cord with a shoe lace until paramedics arrived. \nAndrew said: “She did say use a pin or anything sharp I had around, but at the time I didn’t have anything so I actually had to grab the sack, pinch it, turn and pull.

I knew the baby was coming and had half joked he would have to deliver her. \n“He did so well, he acted really fast and did everything right. A lot of men would have freaked out but he was calm. I’m so proud of him, we all are.” \nAndrew was desperate to make sure he was at the birth of his daughter as he had missed out on seeing the birth of his son Harrison, now one, who had to be induced - then arrived suddenly in the middle of the night after his dad had been sent home from the wards. \nHe added: “We definitely managed that this time, I won’t ever forget it.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T22:06:35.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
