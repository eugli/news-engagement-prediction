To date, the company has raised $270 million for its global payments processing services. \nThe company supports payments in over 200 countries and territories and can handle over 150 different currencies. \nFeatured Image: epSos.de / Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:37:26.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
