A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 \nMr Spicer’s subsequent exchange with reporters at a press conference was cringeworthy. \n“So (Trump) says it’s a ban,” NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker put to Mr Spicer. \n“He’s using the words that the media is using,” Mr Spicer responded. \n“It’s his words!” fired back a reporter in the room. \nMr Spicer said the order “can’t be a ban” if people are still being allowed into the country, instead referring to it as “extreme vetting”. \nOK, so, according to the Press Secretary, Mr Trump’s policy is not a “ban”, and the term “ban” is a concoction of the media. \nLet’s look at Mr Trump’s own tweet again: If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 \nOnce more, with feeling! It seems pretty clear Mr Trump called it a ban. Source: Twitter b-a-n. Source: Twitter \nWelker didn’t let up. “The President himself called it a ban,” she persisted. \n“I understand,” said Mr Spicer. \nWelker asked, “Is he confused, or are you confused?” \n“No, I’m not confused,” replied Mr Spicer. “I think that the words being used to describe it are derived from what the media is calling this. (Trump) has been very clear that it is extreme vetting. \n“With all due respect, I think you have been part of the confusion.” \nRighto. \nTHE INAUGURATION NUMBERS DEBACLE \nMr Spicer was ridiculed immediately after Mr Trump’s presidential inauguration last month, after photos surfaced showing large swathes of empty space compared to Barack Obama’s inauguration eight years ago . \nHe used his first press conference to blast the journalists in front of him for “deliberately false reporting” on crowd size. \n“This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period!” Mr Spicer said. \n“These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong. Photographs of the inaugural proceedings were intentionally framed in a way, one particular tweet minimised the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall.” Mr Spicer used his first press conference to blast reporters over the size of Mr Trump’s inauguration. Source: AFP \nAfter blasting the reporters, he went on to blame “floor coverings” for the perceived smaller crowd at Mr Trump’s inauguration. \n“This was the first time in our nation’s history that floor coverings were used to protect the grass. That had the effect of highlighting areas where people are not standing, while in years past, the grass eliminated this visual.” \nHe then promptly left the briefing without taking questions. \nAn estimated 1.8 million people flooded the National Mall area in 2009 when Barack Obama was first sworn in as president, according to federal and local agencies at the time. \nWashington authorities reported a crowd somewhere over 720,000 people — less than half of the 2009 crowd. \nDEFENDING “ALTERNATIVE FACTS” \nOn the weekend of Mr Trump’s inauguration, his senior adviser Kellyanne Conway was widely ridiculed after telling NBC’S “Meet The Press” that Mr Spicer “gave alternative facts” to the media narrative about the audience size. Kellyanne Conway was widely panned for using the phrase “alternative facts”. Source: AFP \nIn an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity that Tuesday, Mr Spicer defended the widely-panned phrase, comparing it to different weather reports. \n“The press was trying to make it seem like we were ignoring the facts when the facts are that sometimes ... you look at a situation ... in the same way you can look at a weather report,” Mr Spicer said. \n“One weather report comes out and says it’s going to be cloudy and the next one says there’s going to be light rain. No one lied to you.” \nHe then continued with his claim that Mr Trump had the largest inauguration turnout in history. \nRETWEETING “THE ONION” \nEarlier this week, Mr Spicer was made into a laughing stock after he retweeted a story about himself from well-known satirical site The Onion. \nThe spoof article was a clear piss-take, with The Onion tweeting: “@SeanSpicer’s role in the Trump administration will be to provide the American public with robust and clearly articulated misinformation.” \nThe clip included a list of five mocking “facts” about Mr Spicer, calling his speaking style “defensive” and asking whether he had knowingly lied to the press. \n“One’s own mental activity is the only unquestionable fact of one’s experience,” the video says. \nBut Mr Spicer retweeted it regardless, writing: “You nailed it. Period!” You nailed it. Period! https://t.co/AUmS1C222b — Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) January 29, 2017 \nMany questioned whether Mr Spicer was actually aware The Onion is a satirical site. *whispers* did @seanspicer realize @TheOnion is a satirical website or is he being sarcastic...why is the press secretary so bad at twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T07:35:08.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
