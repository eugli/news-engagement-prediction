In the video, you can see Wilder give someone a huge shove. Breazeale doesn't appear to be the one who received the blow. \nThe champ mentioned in a post-fight news conference he had beef with Breazeale -- who had fought on the undercard -- and it appears it all came to a head when their entourages met in the lobby. \nCops reportedly broke up the fight after it spilled into the hotel parking lot, but neither Wilder or Breazeale was arrested.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:22:32.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
