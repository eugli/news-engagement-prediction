The family of M Praveen Kumar alias Kondaiah (35) alleged that he was under pressure to make his payments. \"Two people from a finance company visited our house three times as we failed to pay the EMIs. They used filthy language. Unable to bear the torture, my husband consumed poison,\" said Praveen's wife M Kavitha. Praveen, who was driving for Uber for the past 8 months, was finding it hard to make ends meet as he was earning only Rs 15,000-20,000 a month. The Telangana Cab Drivers and Owners Association (TCDOA) president said that they would lodge a police complaint. \"This is what we are afraid of and wanted people to know that the claims of taxi aggregators are not true. Irrespective of whether we drove the car or not we are not making any mo ney. We also have to face abuse from finance company's offici als if we delay on EMIs,\" said TCDOA president Shiva. While cops said they were investigating the case, Uber authorities could not be reached even after multiple attempts. Praveen's wife also alleged her husband was not provided immediate treatment at Gandhi Hospital and cited it as a reason for his death. \"They delayed treatment saying the ward in which he was admitted does not belong to that particular doctor. Also, after administering an injection, my husband said he was feeling uneasy , but doctors didn't respond and we lost him,\" said Kavitha. Dr J Venkateshwar Reddy , superintendent. Gandhi Hospital, said, \"Praveen was placed in the emergency ward and proper treatment was given. If the family feels there is some negligence, we will look into it.\" Praveen is survived by a wife and two daughters aged 6 and 11.
