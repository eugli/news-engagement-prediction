The height of each tower is 40 metres, with bases of 10 metres square. Four gold crowns decorate the top of each tower. \nAbove the bridge are two suspended enclosed paths that connect the towers on both sides of the river. Pedestrians can walk on the paths, which have windows from which to enjoy the views. \nIs it Ironman or Transformers? Chinese ‘replica park’ puts up new statue \nThe bridge, which cost hundreds of millions of yuan, has drawn debate from the public. Many local residents said they like it, and it has proved a popular backdrop for wedding pictures. Other users of social media have said they felt ashamed of such a building. \nThere are many copies of overseas landmark constructions in China, including the United States Capitol, the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe from Paris and London’s Buckingham Palace.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:48:59.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
