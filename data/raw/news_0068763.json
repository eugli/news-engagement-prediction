Sign up for more newsletters here But the final straw for Price was the reorganization of the National Security Council, which demoted intelligence officials and elevated Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, as a permanent member. And although the CIA director was reinstated as a permanent member, in the eyes of Price, the intention of the White House was clear:\n“[Trump’s White House] has little need for intelligence professionals who, in speaking truth to power, might challenge the so-called ‘America First’ orthodoxy that sees Russia as an ally and Australia as a punching bag.”\nThroughout the campaign and since taking office, Trump has had a fraught relationship with the US intelligence community.\nAdvertisement\nTrump has repeatedly called into question the validity of assessments that point to Russia as being behind the hacking of Democratic officials during the presidential campaign, and has promised an investigation into intelligence-related leaks.\nPrice urged the Trump administration to go beyond “rallies at CIA headquarters and press statements” and make clear that the information and analysis gathered by CIA professionals is being seriously considered by the White House.", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Fdeparting-cia-official-blasts-trump-washington-post%2F5tO0q9UUCwJ1gVmDRralcI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tDeparting", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Departing", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Fdeparting-cia-official-blasts-trump-washington-post%2F5tO0q9UUCwJ1gVmDRralcI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Fdeparting-cia-official-blasts-trump-washington-post%2F5tO0q9UUCwJ1gVmDRralcI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Departing", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Fdeparting-cia-official-blasts-trump-washington-post%2F5tO0q9UUCwJ1gVmDRralcI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Departing", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/i-didnt-think-id-ever-leave-the-cia-but-because-of-trump-i-quit/2017/02/20/fd7aac3e-f456-11e6-b9c9-e83fce42fb61_story.html?utm_campaign=digest&utm_medium=email&utm_source=app&utm_term=.75cbf135f779"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:09:54.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
