I opened the envelope and it said, ‘Emma Stone, La La Land.’ That’s why I took such a long look at Fey and at you. I wasn’t trying to be funny,” said the 79-year-old American actor and filmmaker. \nThis leads us to believe that he was actually holding the card for best actress (which Emma Stone had won moments before). \nThe musical had been the favourite to win. \nHere’s the moment La La Land was wrongly announced as Best Picture at the 2017 Academy Awards.

I blame myself for this. Let’s remember it’s just an awards show,” he said. \n“I mean, we hate to see people disappointed. But the good news is we got to see some extra speeches.” \nBeatty himself has been nominated for fourteen Academy Awards, and is the only person to have been twice nominated for acting, directing, writing, and producing the same film – first with Heaven Can Wait, and again with Reds. \n*Additional by Kim Renfro at INSIDER. \nMore to come. \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
