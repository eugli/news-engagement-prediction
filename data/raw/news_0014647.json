US entry ban victims vent fury Trump border policy: World reacts The appeal against the suspension was formally filed by the US Department of Justice on Saturday.\nMr Trump is named as one of the appellants in his capacity as president, along with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.\nSo has the ban been lifted completely? Judge Robart's temporary restraining order halted the ban nationwide with immediate effect.\nSince then, the state department has said it is reversing visa cancellations and US homeland security employees have been told by their department to comply with the ruling.\nCustoms officials told airlines that they could resume boarding banned travellers. Qatar Airways, Air France, Etihad Airways, Lufthansa and others said they would do so.\nTravellers from the affected countries have tried to use the window of opportunity by boarding US-bound flights on Saturday.\nBut there were also reports that a number of them were not allowed to fly to America.\nWhat is Trump team doing? His administration argues that the travel ban is designed to protect the US.\nIn its appeal it is seeking an emergency stay that would restore the restrictions.\nMeanwhile, the US president raged against Judge Robart in a series of tweets.\n\"The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\" he wrote.\nMr Trump later added in another tweet: \"What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?\"\nHe also referred to a court decision in Massachusetts, where a judge on Saturday declined to extend a statewide travel ban.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/669A/production/_93966262_0f9c3bc8-88d3-40f1-b623-34112c9af290.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38781302", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/12602/production/_93966257_5bb67fdd-16b1-4d95-94ac-8af3cb6255dd.jpg", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827867311054974976", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827981079042805761", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3450980-Government-Appeal-Robart-Ruling.html"], "published": "2017-02-05T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:37:27.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
