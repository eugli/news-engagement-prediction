Part of the rumors are things fly out of that building. So I wanted to see could I trust this building, you know? And so that was part of my thinking.” \nThe 49ers are hiring their third head coach in three years, coming off a 2-14 season and still have a decision to make on quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who’s been the subject of much of the media leaks in the past couple years. But Lynch said his talks with York have convinced him that the owner wants nothing more than an end to the turmoil and a return to the Niners’ winning ways. \n“I can tell you what I found, my interaction with Jed York: He’s a guy that all he wants to do is win,” Lynch told KNBR. “He’s tired of some strife and some contention in the building. He wants harmony. He wants to give us the resources. He wants to be a support mechanism, but he wants to get out of the way and let us work. And, to me, that’s an awesome deal.” \nLynch already has made his first move, hiring vice president of player personnel Adam Peters away from the Broncos, and he promises more exciting moves will come. John Lynch on KNBR to #49ers fans: \"We are going to make you proud with the players we bring in. No stone will be left un-turned.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:20:00.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
