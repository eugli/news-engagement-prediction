Charlotte Coutts /Facebook Charlotte and Dean Coutts say they were harassed by a carpet cleaning company for missing an appointment Charlotte Coutts /Facebook 9 Charlotte had suffered a miscarriage and was in hospital so unable to attend and decided to cancel the appointment \nThe couple now claim they risk losing everything – including their home – and Ben even says he has been compared to vile paedophile Jimmy Savile. \nThe 35-year-old told the Plymouth Herald : “We do want to apologise for the way it was handled. But we don’t deserve what has happened to us \n“We are being made to feel like we are criminals – that we are Plymouth’s most wanted.” Clean Carpets Plymouth bosses say they have received death threats over the claims \nCharlotte and Dean had booked an appointment with Clean Carpets Plymouth back in January. \nBut the couple were struck by tragedy when pregnant Charlotte lost her baby and had to be admitted to hospital. \nThe pair, who live in Plymouth, said they tried to cancel the booking, but were told by the company they would be charged £85 for missing it – and then threatened with having to pay an extra £1,000 in “admin fees” for continuing to respond to its text messages. \nBen has insisted that no invoice was ever issued, despite the couple claiming they were subjected to a string of “aggressive messages” demanding more money. \nThe company’s terms and conditions ask for 48 hours’ notice but Dean and Charlotte said the circumstances didn’t allow for that. Charlotte Coutts /Facebook 9 Charlotte explained the situation with her miscarriage but it did not stop the company demanding payment \nBen says if they had known why the couple wanted to cancel, then the situation “never would have happened”. \nHe added: “We probably would have sent her a bunch of flowers like we have done in the past. \n“I understand some people wouldn’t want to admit to a company they have had a miscarriage, but had she, the situation would have been completely different. \n“I accept some responsibility, I do, I really do, but we don’t deserve what has happened to us. The business is gone and we are having to move house. \n“I’ve had horrible threats like ‘You are worse than Jimmy Savile’ and ‘I hope you die of cancer’. \n“It’s hard to watch something you’ve spent two years of your life trying to build up and then through one conversation it’s blown the business.” Related stories Cops stage chilling reconstruction of brutal murder of postman in bid to find suspects THE EYES HAVE IT British commuters will soon be scanning their EYES to pay for tickets BRITAIN'S MOST FORGIVING WIFE?

I have recently come out of hospital due to losing my baby I do not need this thank you.” (sic) \nDean, 26, later added: “We never said we wasn’t having it done though. Just not ready after what Charlotte has been through…we lost our child…we don’t have to rearrange.” (sic) \nIt is claimed Clean Carpets Plymouth then said every time Charlotte sent them a text message they would “add an admin charge of £25”. Charlotte Coutts /Facebook The firm then claimed every time Charlotte responded to a text message she would owe an extra £25 ‘admin charge’ Charlotte Coutts /Facebook 9 Ben said not all the messages were made public \nBy the end of the stream of around 30 angry messages, the company claimed the pair owed around £1,000 in “admin fees”. \nIt also made claims its staff had been on the end of “threatening behaviour”, allegedly involving members of the couple’s family. \nBut Ben said only some of the messages have been made public, and insisted they don’t tell the full story. \nAt that point she told us she had just got out of hospital, but in this business you do become quite hardened to it. Ben Harbour \nHe said: “We asked them politely ‘Do you wish to rebook’, but then it just spiralled massively and we still hadn’t been told at that stage that she had had a miscarriage. \n“There’s about 12 messages before she tells us. \n“In our opinion they had already wasted our time by making an appointment they couldn’t keep, and contrary to popular belief, at times we are five or six days booked in advance, so appointments are quite important. \n“At that point she told us she had just got out of hospital, but in this business you do become quite hardened to it.” Charlotte Coutts /Facebook The row escalated with the firm claiming it was taking the couple to court for the unpaid bill Charlotte Coutts /Facebook The couple contacted their local Citizens’ Advice and police over the messages Charlotte Coutts /Facebook 9 Police have confirmed they are investigating ‘malicious communications’ \nVicki added: “Losing a baby is tragic, but had we been told from the beginning this was why they couldn’t keep the appointment, it wouldn’t have been a problem.” \nIt was originally reported that police were investigating claims that the carpet cleaners told Charlotte and Dean: “You deserved to lose your baby”. \nVicki said: “I understand it hasn’t been handled very well but we didn’t ever threaten them.” \nShe continued: “It’s horrible to stand there and have your 35-year-old husband beg you to leave him because he feels that he has let me down. That is how it has affected us – and it’s affected our whole family. \n“We don’t deserve this. It feels like we’ve murdered somebody.” \nWe pay for your stories!
