The Fiesta Bowl Block Party was one of the biggest block parties in the country. The last one was in 2011. Instead, the official Fiesta Bowl party will celebrate the game itself , with a tailgating party on the same day as the college football game. That means that they no longer are a sponsor of a Mill Avenue Block Party. \nDue to declining attendance, the party has been scaled back. There is no longer a designated area, there are no tickets, there are no stages of entertainment or Kids Zones. When is the NYE Party on Mill Avenue? \nWell, of course it is on December 31, 2016. Where is it? \nThe Mill Avenue District is in Downtown Tempe. Here is a map with directions , including information about valley Metro Light Rail. How do I get tickets and how much are they? \nThere are no general admission tickets this year. Bars may have a cover charge and you can assume they will have age restrictions. \ncontinue reading below our video Best Road Trip Apps What happens? \nBars with specials, party favors, music, DJ. There will also be food trucks and midnight fireworks. What is the weather usually like? \nHere are some weather statistics and tips that time of year. Will public transportation get me there? \nYes, and it is highly recommended, as Mill Avenue will be closed to vehicular traffic. \nThanks to a sponsor, Coors Light, all buses and Valley Metro Rail rides will be free starting at 7 p.m. on December 31, 2016 until end of regular service . Regular fares are required before 7 p.m. More Info. I don't want to take public transportation. Is there anywhere to park? \nParking meters require payment until 10 p.m. Time limits vary to up to 3 hours. Try one of the following lots: Hayden Square Garage and West Lot at Third Street and Ash Avenue US Airway Garage at Ash Avenue and Rio Salado Parkway University Square on University Drive and Forest Avenue Hayden Ferry Garage on Rio Salado Parkway just east of Mill Avenue Rio Salado Parkway lots east of Priest Drive Centerpoint Garage on Ash Avenue north of University Drive \nBe prepared to pay up to $20 or more when parking in one of these lots for an event. Cash is easiest. Also, be aware that there are many traffic restrictions on New Year's Eve in Downtown Tempe. Leave extra time, bring extra patience. \nWhen driving into downtown Tempe for the Block Party, use the following streets University Ave Forest Ave Rio Salado Parkway \nIf you will be coming on bicycle, you can use the bike corral at Tempe Beach Park. You are responsible for locking up your bicycle. The corral will not be staffed. I'm coming from out of town -- where should I stay? \nHere are some recommended hotels in Tempe. You might also want to stay at a hotel that's on the Valley Metro Rail line , so you don't have to drive. Is there anything else I should know? \nBecause the general area will not be closed off as in past years, I assume that taking open bottle or drinks outside of the bars will not be permitted unless they have made special arrangements for their own outside block party â€” and some of them will. El Hefe and Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row will again hold the Champagne Ball block party near Sixth Street and Mill Avenue. Handlebar and Fat Tuesday will also have a Champagne Ball with dancing and a midnight confetti blast.
