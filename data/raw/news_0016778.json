The University of Pennsylvania announced Tuesday that Biden will lead a new center on campus, the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, and was named the Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor at the Ivy League institution. Former U.S. Vice President Joseph \"Joe\" Biden, center, speaking in the Rose Garden of the… more MIKE THEILER/BLOOMBERG Biden's center will be located in Washington D.C. but he will maintain an office on the campus and work in the university's Annenberg School for Communication and the School of Arts and Sciences, along with an affiliation with its Wharton business school, in his new professorship. The former U.S. Senator from Delaware mentioned his plans to establish a base at Penn while accidentally speaking on a C-Span hot mic early last month before the new presidential administration took office. Biden has a long history with Penn. His granddaughter and two of his children, including his late son Beau, are alumni and Biden has visited campus regularly over the course of his 36 years in the Senate and eight years as vice president. He gave the commencement address and received an honorary degree from the university in 2013. The establishment of his center at Penn marks another step the university is taking toward President Amy Gutmann 's ongoing mission to break the university out beyond its University City borders and boost engagement on a global scale. She sited the opening of its new global policy research center the Perry World House last fall in a statement on Biden's new role at the university. Gutmann also called Biden \"one of the greatest statesmen of our times. “In his distinguished career of service to our nation, he has demonstrated a unique capacity to bring people together across divides and to craft constructive responses to some of the toughest and most important policy challenges of our day,\" Gutmann said in a statement. \"His unsurpassed understanding of diplomacy and far-ranging grasp of world issues make him an ideal fit to further Penn's global engagement – including the work of Penn Global and Perry World House, signature initiatives to develop innovative interdisciplinary global strategies and programs that distinguish Penn as a global agenda setter in higher education.” Michelle Caffrey covers technology and education for the Philadelphia Business Journal.
