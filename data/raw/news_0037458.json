SHARE Link The decline in oxygen was sharpest in the Arctic Ocean, a region facing Earth's starkest climate change. Photo: AP \nThis could have severe consequences for marine organisms if it continues, warned oceanographer Dr Sunke Schmidtko, who conducted the research with Lothar Stramma and Martin Visbeck, all from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany. \nHowever, the loss showed up in some ocean basins more than others. The largest overall volume of oxygen was lost in the largest ocean - the Pacific - but as a percentage, the decline was sharpest in the Arctic Ocean, a region facing Earth's starkest climate change. SHARE Link The amount of oxygen in oceans around the world has declined, German research shows. \nThe loss of ocean oxygen \"has been assumed from models, and there have been lots of regional analysis that have shown local decline, but it has never been shown on the global scale, and never for the deep ocean\", Schmidtko said. \nOcean oxygen is vital to marine organisms, but is also very delicate. Unlike in the atmosphere, where gases mix together thoroughly, in the ocean that is far harder to accomplish, he said. Advertisement \nMoreover, he added, just 1 per cent of all the Earth's available oxygen mixes into the ocean; the vast majority remains in the air. \nClimate change models predict the oceans will lose oxygen because of several factors. Most obvious is simply that warmer water holds less dissolved gases, including oxygen. SHARE Photo: GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research \n\"It's the same reason we keep our sparkling drinks pretty cold,\" Schmidtko said. \nBut another factor is the growing stratification of ocean waters. Oxygen enters the ocean at its surface, from the atmosphere and from the photosynthetic activity of marine microorganisms. But as that upper layer warms up, the oxygen-rich waters are less likely to mix down into cooler layers of the ocean because the warm waters are less dense and do not sink as readily. \n\"When the upper ocean warms, less water gets down deep, and so the oxygen supply to the deep ocean is shut down or significantly reduced,\" Schmidtko said. \nThe new study represents a synthesis of literally \"millions\" of separate ocean measurements over time. The authors then used interpolation techniques for areas of the ocean where they lacked measurements. \nThe resulting study attributes less than 15 per cent of the total oxygen loss to sheer warmer temperatures, which create less solubility. The rest was attributed to other factors, such as a lack of mixing. \nMatthew Long, an oceanographer from the National Centre for Atmospheric Research who has published on ocean oxygen loss, said he considers the new results \"robust\" and a \"major advance in synthesising observations to examine oxygen trends on a global scale\". \nLong was not involved in the current work, but his research had previously demonstrated that ocean oxygen loss was expected to occur and that it should soon be possible to demonstrate that in the real world through measurements, despite the complexities involved in studying the global ocean and deducing trends about it. \nThat's just what the new study has done. \n\"Natural variations have obscured our ability to definitively detect this signal in observations,\" Long said in an email. \n\"In this study, however, Schmidtko et al. synthesise all available observations to show a global-scale decline in oxygen that conforms to the patterns we expect from human-driven climate warming. They do not make a definitive attribution statement, but the data are consistent with and strongly suggestive of human-driven warming as a root cause of the oxygen decline. \n\"It is alarming to see this signal begin to emerge clearly in the observational data,\" he added. \n\"Schmidtko and colleagues' findings should ring yet more alarm bells about the consequences of global warming,\" added Denis Gilbert, a researcher with the Maurice Lamontagne Institute at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Quebec, in an accompanying commentary on the study also published in Nature . \nBecause oxygen in the global ocean is not evenly distributed, the 2 per cent overall decline means there is a much larger decline in some areas of the ocean than others. \nMoreover, the ocean already contains so-called oxygen minimum zones, generally found in the middle depths. The great fear is that their expansion upward, into habitats where fish and other organism thrive, will reduce the available habitat for marine organisms. \nIn shallower waters, meanwhile, the development of ocean \"hypoxic\" areas, or so-called \"dead zones\", may also be influenced in part by declining oxygen content overall. \nOn top of all of that, declining ocean oxygen can also worsen global warming in a feedback loop. In or near low oxygen areas of the oceans, micro-organisms tend to produce nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas, Gilbert writes. Thus the new study \"implies that production rates and efflux to the atmosphere of nitrous oxide ... will probably have increased\". \nThe new study underscores once again that some of the most profound consequences of climate change are occurring in the oceans, rather than on land. In recent years, incursions of warm ocean water have caused large die-offs of coral reefs, and in some cases, kelp forests as well. Meanwhile, warmer oceans have also begun to destabilise glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica, and as they melt, these glaciers freshen the ocean waters and potentially change the nature of their circulation. \nWhen it comes to ocean deoxygenation, as climate change continues, this trend should also increase - studies suggest a loss of up to 7 per cent of the ocean's oxygen by 2100. At the end of the current paper, the researchers are blunt about the consequences of a continuing loss of oceanic oxygen. \n\"Far-reaching implications for marine ecosystems and fisheries can be expected,\" they write. \nThe Washington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:39:52.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
