He was then seriously assaulted, and later died of his injuries. \nOn Saturday, officers arrested and charged Brendan Severight, 24, with first-degree murder. \nArrest warrants for first-degree murder have been issued for two other suspects in connection to Balonyk’s death. \nLuke Moar, 31, is described as 5’9 and 210 lbs.
