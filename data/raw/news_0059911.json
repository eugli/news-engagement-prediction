Share via Twitter Atsushi Yamada / Getty Images You likely have a pretty set routine for coping when you get your period : You use tampons, pads, or a menstrual cup to control the blood flow, and then go about your life. Now, a chiropractor in Kansas has invented a lipstick-like glue meant to seal your labia shut during your period and hold blood in until you go to the bathroom. According to a Facebook post that features an ad for the labia glue, it's supposed to be revolutionary. \"Have you ever woken up with your lips stuck together?\" the ad says. \"It didn’t hurt and it was kind of fun. All you had to do was wet your lips from the inside with saliva and they became unstuck. Mensez feminine lipstick is a natural patented compound of amino acids and oil in a lipstick applicator that is applied to the lips down under during the period.\" It continues: \" Urine instantly unsticks the labia and allows everything to wash out into the toilet, [then you] wipe and reapply Mensez lipstick. Clean, Safe, Secure, and Done. Coming to a store near you soon.\" Chiropractor Dan Dopps, CEO and president at Wichita-based Mensez Technologies, created this glue, and he tells The Wichita Eagle that he doesn’t “want to offend anyone” with his product. “It’s a good option that if women will actually consider, they will see it will improve their lives,” he says. While the product is in its infancy, it’s for real: Dopps has patented his “lip-stick” but hasn’t actually manufactured it yet. Dopps says he’s worked on the product for years, noting that several manufacturers have expressed interest. He also created a Facebook page that has now been removed after it fielded plenty of negative comments. “Yes, I am a man and you as a woman, should have come up with a better solution then diapers and plugs, but you didn’t,” read a remark from the now-unavailable Mensez Facebook account, per The Wichita Eagle . “Reason being women are focused on and distracted by your period 25% of the time, making them far less productive [than] they could be.” San Francisco Bay Area ob/gyn Jen Gunter , M.D., isn’t impressed by Dopps' product. “It’s ridiculous,” she tells SELF. “It certainly hasn’t even been tested on anybody, and the idea that such a glue exists that could be dissolved by urine but not by blood is really fantastical.” Jessica Shepherd , M.D., an assistant professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology and director of Minimally Invasive Gynecology at The University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago, tells SELF that the way Dopps describes his product and talks about periods is “inflammatory and judgmental.” People can obviously have their periods and be just as productive and focused as usual, contrary to what Dopps seems to think. Plus, she adds, tampons, pads, and menstrual cups already do a good job of helping people with their periods. There are also concerns about how this would actually work. “Repeated applications of this supposedly non-toxic glue could potentially cause skin trauma,” Gunter says. And, she adds, the ramifications if the glue were to fail—which many period products do at some point—would be pretty inconvenient and messy. “What happens if you laugh or cough, and a little bit of urine comes out—does that dissolve your seal and all of a sudden your backed up menstrual blood comes out?” Gunter says. Plus, people have vastly different labia, so who's to say it's even possible for everyone's to stick together to create this leak-preventing seal? On the flip side, there's the potential issue of what could happen if a person couldn't unstick their labia . “That might require a surgical procedure,” Shepherd says. And if a person used this product, had a heavy period, and didn't pee often, blood could theoretically go backwards into their uterus, out through their fallopian tubes, and potentially contribute to endometriosis via retrograde menstruation , Lauren Streicher , M.D., an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, tells SELF. People might think the criticism of Mensez stems from its creator being a man, but that's not the issue, Gunter says. “I don’t feel offended that he’s a man; I feel offended that he’s someone who has some type of medical background and obviously hasn’t thought this through, as well as the distasteful comments that he’s made about women,” she says. So, there you have it: Mensez isn't the answer to heavy periods. If you find that you tend to leak when you use pads, tampons, and menstrual cups, you might need to change your products more often, Sherry A.Ross , M.D., a women's health expert and author of She-ology: The Definitive Guide to Women's Intimate Health. Period , tells SELF. \"Changing your tampon and pad every two to six hours and using a menstrual cup are still the best ways of avoiding a bloody mess,\" she says. However, Ross adds, if you're doing that and still are having issues due to a heavy flow, she recommends talking to your doctor to make sure you don't have an underlying problem—not resorting to glue.
