Ian Grillot, a 24-year-old American man was also injured while intervening in the shooting. \nPolice arrested Purinton in Henry County, west central Missouri, after he reportedly walked into an Applebee’s restaurant there and confided to the bartender that he had been involved in a shooting. \nThe shooter was charged on Thursday with first-degree murder. He was also charged with two counts of attempted first-degree murder in the shootings of Mr. Madasani and Mr. Grillot. \nHe was extradited to Kansas on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T11:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:52:35.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
