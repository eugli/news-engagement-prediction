Will Insha’Allah be back in a week or so. The spin being given to my benign visit by a section of media is ridiculous,” she tweeted. \nLast month, the German publication Suddeutsche Zeitung — the original source of the Panama Papers leaks — released documents supposedly linking Maryam to Minerva Financial Services Ltd, the company that owns the Park Lane flats in London. \nThe family of Prime Minister Sharif has been named in the Panama Papers, one of the biggest leaks in history. \nThe leak, comprising 11.5 million documents from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca, shows how some of the world’s most powerful people have secreted away their money in offshore jurisdictions. \nAmong those named are three of Sharif’s four children — Maryam, who has been tipped to be his political successor; Hasan and Hussain, with the records showing they owned London real estate through offshore companies administrated by the firm. \nSharif and his family have denied any wrongdoing. \nThe hearing in the case is expected to resume on February 13 after it was postponed due to the ill-health of Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed. \n(With inputs from PTI) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T16:09:10.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
