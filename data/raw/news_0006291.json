It uses shock and water resistant (IP68) Android devices that are designed for emergency situations. ADVERTISEMENT \nIt added that the SOS Dispatch was designed around the Philippine 911 system, itself patterned after the 911 system in the United States. \n“The 911 emergency response system of the United States has always been a model to emulate with regards to security and public safety,” Jovy Hernandez, first vice president and Head of Enterprise groups at PLDT and Smart, said. \n“The technology to make the same happen in the Philippines is available through mobility and the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Smart SOS Dispatch is designed to do just that,” he added. \nSmart SOS dispatch allows the whole emergency reporting, response and recording process turn “more instantaneous and reliable.” The NowForce cloud system instantly gathers all necessary information reported by a caller to a command center, PLDT said. \nThis information is recorded and processed through the NowForce CRM and sent to all concerned responding units in near-real time. \n“Through this automation in information assessment and transmittal, time and resources are saved as calls are instantly directed to only the most relevant and nearest response units for dispatch,” PLDT said. \nPLDT noted it has already partnered with certain LGUs, such as the city of Bacoor in Cavite and the province of Ilocos Norte. \n“Smart SOS Dispatch is highly beneficial for LGUs, especially in barangays where responding units should be more accessible and centralized,” PLDT said. The Smart SOS Dispatch was being offered to LGUs exclusively at P3,500 per month.
