As an ad hoc judge appointed by Bosnia-Herzegovina, he ruled to ensure that the court protected the needs of individuals, the “ultimate beneficiaries of the legal system”, in a case he believed to have “a human dimension of a magnitude without precedent in [the ICJ’s] history”.\nServing on the World Bank administrative tribunal (1980-98, for the last two years as president), he contributed to a series of landmark decisions to protect the rights of employees against the power of international organisations. As an advocate, he took on cases that consistently broke new ground, including New Zealand’s 1995 challenge to French nuclear testing in the South Pacific, which led to the ICJ’s recognition that the protection of the environment formed part of general international law.\nAt Cambridge University, he founded in 1983 what is now the Lauterpacht Centre for International Law , focused on scholarship that is practical and progressive. In all these activities, his great passion was the practice of public international law in all its forms.\nCalled to the bar at Gray’s Inn in 1950, he began a career that touched on a multitude of subjects and places, among them the negotiation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea , the 1994 peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission and the peaceful resolution of a land dispute between Egypt and Israel. From his first case at the ICJ – the nationalisation of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company – in 1951 to the last in 2014, and at other courts in between, he engaged with the changes to the international legal order that followed the end of the second world war.\nThe ICJ, the primary judicial body of the United Nations, had begun work in 1946, and Lauterpacht’s early role in it enabled him to help others to follow. In advising a panoply of individuals, NGOs, corporations and international organisations, he contributed to the enhanced role they now play in international affairs.\nBorn in Cricklewood, north-west London, Elihu was the son of Jewish parents. Recently arrived from Vienna, his mother, Rachel (nee Steinberg), was a pianist; his father, Hersch, born near Lviv in what is now Ukraine, was a legal academic at the London School of Economics . The family moved to Cambridge in 1937 when Hersch was appointed to a chair, and in 1941 Elihu was evacuated to the US, and studied at Phillips academy, Andover, Massachusetts.\nIn 1945 he returned to Britain to study at Harrow school and then Trinity College, Cambridge – first history, then law. An only child, he followed his father into international law but forged his own path: departing from his father’s inclination towards theory, yet sharing the commitment to the law as a means of delivering international justice, he focused more on what was practicable. This caused him to embrace an academic path that placed the accent on legal practice and on the role of international courts and tribunals in making international law more effective.\nIn 1953 he was appointed to a fellowship at Trinity and an assistant lectureship in the law faculty; an honorary professorship came in 1994. I was among the fortunate beneficiaries of the generous support he gave to his “former pupils”.\nFrom 1960 onwards he edited the International Law Reports, a principal source of reference across the globe. He wrote on the administration of international justice, edited several volumes of his father’s collected papers, and in 2010 published a meticulous biography of his father.\nTo each case – as advocate or adjudicator – Lauterpacht brought particular skills: a deep knowledge of historical context; an ability to master the facts and explain them (his argument to the ICJ on the practicalities of exploding an underground nuclear device remains a first point of reference for any international advocate who faces the challenge of arguing a point of science before a panel of 15 or more international judges); and a special sense as to what might be persuasive to an international judge. He was a fearlessly independent advocate in whose hands a turgid treaty or fact could be made interesting, always in a tone that was fair, easy on the ear and persuasive. He was appointed a QC in 1970 and knighted in 1998.\nWarm and humane, Lauterpacht was without pomposity of the kind that characterised the once fusty world of international law. In 1996, when we appeared together for Ireland in a planning inquiry on the disposal of nuclear waste at Sellafield, he delighted in a hearing in the small town of Cleator Moor in Cumbria that was held in a glorified Portakabin, and was even more delighted when his arguments prevailed – the burden of proof lay on Nirex, the nuclear industry body, “to show that no danger can or will arise” from accidental discharges. The application for a deep waste repository was rejected by the environment secretary, John Gummer, and has not been revived.\nLauterpacht was never starry-eyed about international law: he recognised law’s role in international relations, but also it limits. The large book-lined study at his open, inviting home was a place that no former pupil could forget, truly a room of learning and laughter.\nIn 1955 he married Judith Hettinger, with whom he had three children, Deborah, Gabriel and Michael. After Judith’s death in 1970, he married Cathy Daly, and together they had a son, Conan. He is survived by Cathy and his children.\n• Elihu Lauterpacht, international lawyer, born 28 July 1928; died 8 February 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:28:58.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
