(USA TODAY Network/USA TODAY Network/Sipa USA) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  16 PM \nSARASOTA, Fla. — The Yankees may have been looking at their third baseman of the future Monday at Ed Smith Stadium. \nBut was he wearing navy blue and grey — or white and orange? \nYankees fans are already wondering whether Orioles superstar Manny Machado will be sporting pinstripes in 2019. Given that the organization will have a ton of money to spend by then, and the luxury tax threshold will be $206 million, understandably so. \nOver the last two seasons, Machado, 24, has averaged a .290/.351/.518 batting line with 36 homers, 91 RBIs, 35 doubles and 104 runs scored. During that span, only Mike Trout, Josh Donaldson and Kris Bryant have had a higher FanGraphs WAR. \nMachado would be the perfect Yankee — already the beloved face of his current franchise, a feared middle-of-the-order hitter and a two-time Gold Glove award winner in the field. The only problem he might encounter would be having to change numbers if A-Rod's No. 13 gets retired in Monument Park. \nAt the same time, the Bombers are also very high on their own third base prospect, Miguel Andujar. Heading into his age-22 season, Andujar is coming off a standout 2016 campaign in which he hit .273/.332/.410 with 12 homers and 83 RBIs between Class-A Tampa and Double-A Trenton. \nHe may not be as highly-touted as Gleyber Torres, Clint Frazier or Blake Rutherford, but Alex Rodriguez is very high on him — and A-Rod isn't alone. Joe Girardi sees big things in Andujar's future. \n\"I look at him and say he's going to be a big-league player, he just needs more reps,\" Girardi said. \nYankees vice president of baseball operations Tim Naehring agrees.

I love the untapped potential that he has. \n\"He can do things at third base,\" Naehring continued. \"Is he a finished product? No. But he's got the tools to be impactful on the defensive side. And obviously if you watch him taking batting practice and you look at his physical size, I think he's a guy that can hit for average, hit for power and use the whole field, so I'm really excited about him.\" \nAsked why Andujar, who signed with the Yankees in 2011 as a free agent, was able to take off last season, Naehring responded: \"He was able to slow the game down on both sides of the ball. When young players learn how to control their heartbeat a little bit it's amazing how quickly the tools turn into performance between the lines.\" \nAndujar doubled and tripled in his spring training debut on Friday. His development remains a work in progress. \n\"I'm focusing on all aspects of my game,\" Andujar said through a translator. \"I'm so happy for this opportunity to be around so many great major leaguers with a lot of experience. Last year, I was focused on not giving away at-bats and playing consistent defense. The key was my preparation.\" \nAndujar grew up wanting to emulate A-Rod, his favorite player. Now, he enjoys watching Adrian Beltre pick it at the hot corner. \n\"It's an honor that people think so highly of me, and it gives me motivation moving forward,\" said Andujar, who was one of the young prospects who dined with A-Rod last week. \"Alex told us we need to be smart and make the right decisions at all times.\" \nYankees fans can dream about landing Machado for the next two years. In the meantime, they can dream about Andujar fulfilling his potential, too.
