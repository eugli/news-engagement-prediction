After causing a ruckus, the ABVP members also reportedly clashed with the police.There were also reports of students being threatened, locked inside the college and beaten.Yesterday, ABVP members disrupted a seminar at which JNU student Umar Khalid was invitd to speak. Khalid was among the students charged with sedition in connection with an event at JNU last year where anti-national slogans were allegedly raised.Members of Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) and the ABVP gathered outside the college and shouted slogans demanding that the invite to \"anti-nationals\" be cancelled. Even after the college cancelled Khalid's address, the ABVP allegedly vandalised college property and pelted stones at students and teachers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:04:39.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
