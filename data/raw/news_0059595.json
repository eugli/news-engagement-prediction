Its visa-free policy was extended to Israel and 83 other countries in December 2015 in a bid to increase tourism. \nIn March last year Netanyahu called for diplomatic relations to be formally established with Indonesia because of the “many opportunities for bilateral cooperation”, especially in technology.
