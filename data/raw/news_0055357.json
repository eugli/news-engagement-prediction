Image caption Adrian fell over several times during the cross country qualifier \n\"Maybe I have fallen many times but what really counts is that I will always continue to rise.\" \nAdrian was due to spend a month training on snow in Sweden before the event, but told AFP that he was deported from France during his first attempt to reach Scandinavia. \n\"When I got to Paris on 19 January, I explained that I was on my way to Sweden to train. They did not believe that I ski in Venezuela. Image caption He didn't complete the qualifying race :( \n\"I told them that we train on wheels. I only had 28 euros with me and the police accused me of trying to immigrate because things were going badly in my country. \n\"I missed a month of practice on the snow. But I am still trying because this is my dream.\" \nSadly, Lahti 2017 organisers confirmed on Twitter that Adrian did not complete the race. \nAdrian's story has echoes of the 1993 movie Cool Runnings, which was based on the real life story of a bobsleigh team from Jamaica who'd never trained on snow before competing at the 1988 Olympics. \nWarning: Third party content might contain ads \nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:49:05.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
