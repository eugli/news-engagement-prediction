Here’s the truth By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Friday, February 24, 2017 - 08:22 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nMumbai: Deepika Padukone is extremely elated with the performance of her debut Hollywood movie – ‘xXx: Return of Xander Cage’ – at the Box Office. And now, she is focussing on her next big project – ‘Padmavati’ – with Sanjay Leela Bhansali. However, few reports hinted that the actress may also being doing the official remake of Hollywood movie ‘Mr & Mrs Smith’. \nQuashing all rumours, the dimpled beauty from Bangalore said, “Well, let's set the record straight because there have been a lot of rumours regarding a lot of films I am supposedly doing. I think usually there is a lot of dignity involved when an actor is approached for a film, whether it's a narration or when an actor saying yes or no to a film.” \n“I had always maintained, when I am offered a film, I'll talk about it, if not, I'll never talk about it. All the speculation can go on. The only film I am doing now is ‘Padmavati’, it's consuming all my life. When I have something else to talk about I will do that,” she added. \nDeepika will be essaying the titular role in SLB’s magnum opus. The film ran into controversy recently over its content. Following protests, the filmmaker clarified that the film will not distort history and that the film doesn’t intend to hurt anyone’s sentiments. \nSlated to release on November 17, ‘Padmavati’ also stars Shahid Kapoor (as Rawal Ratan Singh) and Ranveer Singh (as Alauddin Khilji). \n(With IANS inputs) First Published: Friday, February 24, 2017 - 08:22 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:28:12.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
