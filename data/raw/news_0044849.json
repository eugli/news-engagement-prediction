Grandma’s Garden \nNot far from Krome Ave, you’ll find this off-the-beaten-path, family-owned produce stand and u-pick field. Unlike most local strawberry fields, Grandma’s Garden accepts cards on top of cash. But like most others, they, too, offer sweet strawberry shakes to keep you cool in the Miami heat. Other goodies available at this unique stand are eggplants, watermelons, boiled peanuts, u-pick flowers, and raw honey. Show map Take me there 5. Strawberry Fields of Kendall \nAnyone who’s been to or lived in Kendall long enough has likely driven past one of the fields belonging to this small biz. Strawberry Fields of Kendall own four separate u-pick fields, including ones in Kendall and West Kendall, Country Walk, and another just off the turnpike. They’ve got some of the best prices in town, with u-pick strawberries for just $2.50 per pound and tomatoes at $1 a pound. While you won’t find milkshakes or ice cream here, you’ll definitely leave with enough berries to make your own sweet treats at home (plus bell peppers, sweet potatoes, corn, and more). Season runs December through May, and all fields are open daily from 9 a.m. through 6 p.m. Show map Take me there Priscilla Blossom is a freelance writer specializing in travel, pop culture, parenting, and all things feminist.
