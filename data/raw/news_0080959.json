We wondered what controversy the latest edition of the awards would bring along. Little did we all know that this year’s Oscars would go down in history for one of the biggest goof-ups. Presenters Warren and Faye announced La La Land as the winner of the Best Film Award when it was actually Moonlight. Host Jimmy Kimmel was pretty much as clueless as all of us when the chaos ensued on stage. He was not able to conduct the ceremony well after this. And well, he had some explaining to do. \nIn the opening monologue of the latest episode of his talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live, he gave us a step by step breakdown of the final moments before the disaster. And Jimmy being Jimmy, he made it sound as funny as possible. \n“I don’t know if you know this but I hosted the Oscars last night. Anyone of you ever hosted Oscars? Let me tell you about it. Except for the end, it was a lot of fun.” he opened his monologue. “It went very well. We were chugging along, and then, all of a sudden out of nowhere, it turned into a Maury Povich paternity test show. ” he further added. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were invited to present the last award as it was the 50th anniversary of their iconic film Bonnie and Clyde, Jimmy explained. “Warren was confused so he handed over the envelope to Faye,” he said. After this La La Land’s crew went up on the stage to collect their award and Jimmy was sitting in the audience. “The plan is for me to end the show from the audience next to Matt Damon, who, make no mistake, whatever confusion there was about who won, Matt Damon lost. He was a loser. He is a loser. But we’re sitting there and we notice some commotion going on and Matt says, ‘I think I heard the stage manager say they got the winner wrong,’ which is unusual,” he said. “So I walk up the stair and as soon as I get there this happens…” And while the producer of La La Land, Jordan Horowitz, cleared the confusion…Jimmy got lost in the storm! And thank God the producer took charge of the situation, because this could have been Jimmy’s next step: Then as Moonlight’s cast and crew stepped on stage, it became chaotic. People got confused about who is from which film’s team, and Jimmy said this: Thankfully, Denzel Washington was sitting in the front row, and he tried to salvage the situation. “Now I see Denzel Washington in the front row, trying to get my attention. I don’t know what he is pointing but he yell ‘Barry’. Eventually I figured Barry Jenkins, director of Moonlight is standing behind me, and Denzel wants me to get him to the microphone and make a speech. Which made sense!” he said. \n“Faye Dunaway made quite a getaway. She got the hell out of there. She read the wrong name and she split. She wanted no part of it.” Jimmy ended.
