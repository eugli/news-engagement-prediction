Advertisement \n\"Women can now identify 'that's me' it's not just some 18-year-old kid in a hoodie drinking energy drinks. We are slowly creeping towards gender equality.\" \nThe future looks even brighter with males making up 69 per cent of the future founders surveyed and females 31 per cent. Children and mortgages \nAs the start-up world matures and becomes less divided along gender lines common barriers to entry remain. \nFor the first time Startup Muster included 239 \"future founders\" or \"wantrapreneurs\" in its dataset alongside 685 start-ups and 474 organisations that support start-ups. \nOf those surveyed, 49 per cent of future founders say they are being hindered from launching a start-up by \"life circumstances\" that require a stable income. \nThis was closely followed by 39 per cent who say \"financial dependents\" such as children and mortgages are hindering them while 30 per cent say they lack the technical skills to launch a start-up. \nIt's not just some 18-year-old kid in a hoodie drinking energy drinks. Monica Wulff \nThe same concerns were listed by those who had gone on to found start-ups with 37 per cent citing a requirement for stable income and 33 per cent listing financial dependents as the factors that had hindered them from initially starting their business. \nAlmost half of all start-up founders got around these financial constraints by starting up their business on the side. \nStartup Muster found 47 per cent of start-ups were started by people working part-time with 25 per cent of founders currently holding a job outside their start-up. \nWulff says this year the research team looked to understand not just start-ups but the \"whole community around them\". \n\"So it's been important to look at people who have an idea about what they want to do but haven't been able to execute on it,\" she says. \nWulff says there is a lot of fear around starting a business and leaving a stable income behind. \n\"Essentially it is, 'How am I going to pay my mortgage or my kids' school tuition if I leave my steady job?'. It's a bit of a gamble and it's a big consideration.\" \nWulff says she would like to see services available to help start-up founders with the transition from wage earner to small business owner. The reality of start-up life \nWhen it comes to what people expected to enjoy about running a start-up the expectations of future founders and the reality of start-up founders generally aligned. \nThe main driver is ownership of the value created, with 77 per cent of founders and 64 per cent of future founders listing this as their main expectation of start-up life. \nThis was closely followed by \"developing technology that excites me\" and \"developing new skills\". \nJared Kristensen, the co-founder of start-up Audience Republic, says founding the online platform for events organisers allowed him to be a part of \"creating something from nothing\". \n\"There is so much creativity in building a business,\" he says. \"To me it doesn't seem like work.\" \nAudience Republic recently closed a $525,000 investment round but Kristensen says it was a \"really tough decision\" to move from a stable income working in start-ups to actually starting his own business. \n\"I had a pretty good salary and it was definitely a big thing to give that up, it was a massive lifestyle change,\" he says. \"I gave up dinners with friends, the midweek drinks, holidays, even things like taxis. We boot-strapped the business all the way up until now, for a while it was barely enough to cover the rent.\" \nKristensen says the start-up community is diversifying. \n\"There are lots of different founders from all walks of life now, older founders and female founders,\" he says. \n\"I think the stereotypes are breaking down.\" \nAnd for the record, Kristensen doesn't wear a hoodie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:58:44.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
