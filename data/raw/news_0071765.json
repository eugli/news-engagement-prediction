Charlotte Cushman, a renowned 19th century stage actress who played both male and female roles (Lady Macbeth as well as Hamlet), died in 1876 in her room on the third floor. Now, one of the elevators often travels on its own to the third floor, even when no buttons are pushed. \nMore Haunting: \nCharlotte isn't the only ghost suspected to haunt the third floor of the Omni Parker House. A businessman died in room 303. Guests and staff have reported the smell of whiskey and raucous laughter. After a large number of guest complaints, the room was converted into a closet. \nSpooky Visits: \nSome surprised guests have reported seeing Harvey Parker, the hotel's founder, in their rooms asking about their stay. Mr. Parker died in 1884. \nHistory and Legend: \nThe Omni Parker House was the gathering place for \"The Saturday Club,\" a group which included Longfellow, Thoreau, Dickens and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Since Longfellow's favorite room was on the third floor, many suspect the elevator is returning him upstairs after a club meeting. \nStay Overnight:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:17:52.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
