BBC/EASTENDERS 2 Dot Cotton was shocked when her “bushes” internet search didn’t bring the desired results \nWhile cameras didn’t show poor Dot’s X-rated sight, she looked horrified and quickly shut the screen. \nLater on when Abbi asked her how her search was coming along, Dot complained that there was: “Ladies popping up with no bras.” \nViewers found Dot’s rude welcoming hilarious.
