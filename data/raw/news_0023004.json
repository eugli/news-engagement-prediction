Those \"active\" DPs can be replaced at the beginning of each of the next two rounds, but only by another DP. Once a DP has been replaced, he cannot return to the active roster for a subsequent round. \nUsing Team Italy as an example, Orlando Junior Oberto and Carlos Teran are the active DPs for the first round of pool play, so they can be replaced on the roster before the second round or the championship round, but only by one of the team's other DPs. And if a DP joins for the second round, he can be replaced for the championship round, but only by another DP. \nMarco Mazzieri returns to manage Team Italy, which advanced to the second round in '13. The Italians finished 10th in the '06 and '09 tournaments.
