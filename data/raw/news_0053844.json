It contains the usual suspects (tequila, agave, and lime juice) yet turns rosy with the addition of Aperol. Many margarita recipes include Cointreau or Grand Marnier (aka an orange liqueur) in the mix, so Aperol, a bitter orange aperitif, nods to the tradition of a margarita while adding a tart, complex tang. Lastly, it's served in a black-salt-rimmed glass, an elegant and refined detail. I'll be frank when I say, I'd probably request this as a full drink at the bar. At any rate, I'll definitely attempt to make these for upcoming Fall and Halloween parties to shock and delight the taste buds of my party guests.
