Others are saying they would if they had paid the $1,000 required to put a car on hold. . @tqbf Thanks. Cancelled my early reservation and will be donating the $1k to charity instead. Kills me as a TSLA fan but need to take stand pic.twitter.com/JW7Mjc903U — Colin Niloc (@colinniloc81) January 30, 2017 Well I haven't gotten the money back from Tesla yet, but the Twitter Police are saying i don't have the intention to donate. So I just did. — Colin Niloc (@colinniloc81) February 1, 2017 If I had a Tesla on order I would cancel it.\"Elon Musk: I'm Trump's voice of reason - BBC News\" https://t.co/WImccpa9Lo — Joseph Lord (@jl_hfl) January 27, 2017 \nSome are also saying that Musk associating with Trump shouldn't be protested because it's good to have dissenting voices in places of power. Part of me wants to cancel my #TESLA order.But the rest replies \"if we keep good people off #Trump 's staff, what would he be left with?\" — Ric Bretschneider (@ricbret) January 29, 2017 \nWhile Musk has described Mr Trump as \"probably not the right guy\" to run the United States, he agreed to serve on Trump's Strategic & Policy Forum and a manufacturing council. \n\"The more voices of reason that the President hears, the better,\" he has said . \nMusk praised Trump's choice for Secretary of State and says he agrees with Rex Tillerson's support for a carbon tax. And he took to Twitter to ask his followers for suggestions on ways to amend the immigration order. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.
