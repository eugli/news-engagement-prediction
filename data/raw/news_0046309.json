It’s madness isn’t it - just mind-blowing.” \nHe is talking about Ronnie Radford and quite probably the most famous giant killing goal of all time. Raggett realises he has just done something that could be remembered and repeated in 40 years time, just like the Hereford hero. \nYet at 23, his FA Cup knowledge is more limited, his own memories far more recent. He knows the competition writes football legend though, even if he can’t quite take it all in just yet.

It’s unheard of in modern day football for a non league team to get to the quarter final, so it’s crazy isn’t it.” Raggett knows little about Hereford hero Ronnie Radford (Photo: Mirrorpix) But he's well aware of Ray Parlour after his Arsenal exploits in 2002 (Photo: Reuters) \nEven in these surreal times, it IS crazy. \nLincoln City of the National League, 81 places below Burnley, are the first non league team in 103 years to reach the quarter finals of the world’s oldest, most glittering competition. \nThey did it by beating, in their own stadium, a team who have the third best home record in the Premier League. And it was no fluke - they were the better team. \nTheir management team of Danny and Nicky Cowley created with almost military precision a game-plan designed to frustrate Burnley, and to exploit the innate complacency and confusion of dealing with opponents from a different world. \nThe plan - the dream - was to keep the game tight, to restrict their opponents and exploit set pieces, particularly at the end. Especially at the end, when there was little time to retaliate.
