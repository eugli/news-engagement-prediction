Very few details were released on when we can expect the game or what platforms it will be available on, but some concept art and a description were unveiled. Square Enix Studio Istolia, whose name comes from the Greek word for \"story\" had the following to say about its ambitions for the game: The project aims to build a new RPG with a new fantasy: unfolding across a vast land teeming with life. Nurtured by the earth, the many peoples of this land dare to dream, fighting for what is justâ€”and this is their tale .
