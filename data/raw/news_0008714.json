SCRAP-IT Program , can bring prices down by up to $12,000. \nMany electric vehicles range in price from around $30,000 to almost $100,000 for a car like the Tesla Model S. Story continues below \nThe SCRAP-IT Program gives $6,000 toward the purchase or lease of a new electric vehicle or $3,000 for the purchase or lease of a used electric vehicle, but only if you scrap your old car. \n“Transportation accounts for nearly half of the emissions by the average B.C. family, and light-duty vehicles account for 14 per cent of B.C.’s overall emissions,” Minister of Environment Mary Polak said in a release. “With 98 per cent of our electricity in B.C coming from clean or renewable sources, encouraging people to buy or lease a zero-emission vehicle is one of the best ways we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ensure British Columbia remains a climate action leader.” \nThe incentives will only be available until March 2018 or as long as the funds last. \nThe province has committed over $70 million in vehicle incentives through the Clean Energy program since 2011. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
