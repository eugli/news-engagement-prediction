Source: Tweet \nMelbourne City's marquee man believes his side have drawn a perfect time to play the Sky Blues when they meet on Friday night. \nCity bounced back to winning ways with a 5-1 demolition of Wellington on the same day that Sydney's unbeaten run ended with a 1-0 loss to Western Sydney. \nCity also boast a winning record over Graham Arnold's side courtesy of their FFA Cup final success in November. \nIn the AAMI Park rematch this weekend, Cahill says he expects Sydney to be on the back foot. \n\"You know they're going to come here and defend,\" he said on Wednesday. \n\"It'd be very unlikely for them to come out and attack. They've got a lot going forward but their manager makes sure they're well drilled. \n\"The way they play, all the midfield fuses back in. There's 11 behind the ball, 24/7.\" Wanderers end Sydney FC's unbeaten A-League run Western Sydney have sent Sydney FC to their first A-League defeat this season, shocking the runaway leaders 1-0 to end their 19-match unbeaten run. \nTo Socceroo forward Cahill, that's a legitimate game style, but it has yet to prove successful at the pointy end of the season. \n\"You have to respect that. That's the reason that they're at the top (but) questions will be asked when it's about winning games at the right times,\" he said. \n\"Come finals time, that's when everyone needs to be firing. \n\"You can slip in the backdoor and (last-placed) Adelaide can do it now if they want and finish sixth and win the league. \n\"It's whoever is up for the fight at the end of the season.\" \nOff the back of last weekend's showing, Cahill would argue City have stolen a march on the competition. \nTheir drubbing of The Nix was just a third win in 11 matches since City's FFA Cup final win. \nIrrespective of their results, Cahill says the club's performances merited a place in the title conversation. \n\"We weathered the storm at the start (against the Phoenix) and when you look at it, we played excellent,\" he said. \n\"We're working hard to bring some real steel to the team. \n\"There's a fresh buzz about our team and we're starting to click. \n\"This is like another FFA Cup final. Everyone's got to be excited about this game because there's a lot (riding) on it.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:51:33.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
