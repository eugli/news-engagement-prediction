The recently launched Ignis model has also been well received by the market, with more than 10,000 initial bookings. According to Nirmal Bang Commodities, the Swift model’s upgrade is due which, coupled with Ignis and other key models are likely to drive 12 per cent volume growth for MSIL in FY18. \n\n“Following a robust product pipeline, we expect MSIL to report double-digit volume growth over FY17E/FY18E, driving market share gains for the company. We expect margins to remain around 16 per cent in FY17E/FY18E, which will drive double-digit earnings growth in the coming years. The stock price of the company can touch Rs 6,688 in coming months,” the brokerage house said in a research note. \n\nCCL Products: Nirmal Bang is bullish on CCL Products with a target price of Rs 405. “We expect sales, Ebitda and net profit to rise 20 per cent, 22 per cent and 27 per cent CAGR, respectively, over FY17E-FY19E with volume growth of 16 per cent over the same period,” the brokerage house said. \n\nThe company is engaged in the manufacturing of instant coffee.

Brokerage house HDFC Securities is bullish on IGL with a target price of Rs 1,200. \n\nThe stock price has almost doubled in the past year, led by strong performance and multiple re-rating. “We expect margins to remain flat and a volume CAGR of 10 per cent.

Going ahead, we expect the adverse impact of demonetisation to continue in the short term. However, the improving demand from new end-use segments, coupled with the higher capacity coming on stream would be the key volumes drivers for APL in the medium to long term,” IIFL Private Wealth said in a note.
