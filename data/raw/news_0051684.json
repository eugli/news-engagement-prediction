Then The Weekly Standard revealed that Decius was Michael Anton, a senior staff member at the National Security Council, and a news media stampede was on. \n  The Intercept called his writings the “intellectual source code of Trumpism.” Salon put him alongside Stephen K. Bannon and Stephen Miller in the administration’s “white nationalist ‘genius bar,’” while the conservative writer (and staunch Never-Trumper) William Kristol, writing on Twitter, compared him to the Nazi theorist Carl Schmitt. It certainly added up to a publicity coup for a small West Coast institute known for summer seminars at which young conservatives immerse themselves in the Federalist Papers and other classics of American political thought. Suddenly, The Claremont Review, an erudite journal with a mere 13,000 subscribers, was being hailed as the bible of highbrow Trumpism — “crucially important,” as the journalist Damon Linker wrote , “for anyone seeking to understand the evolution of the Republican and conservative movement.” Photo Charles R. Kesler, editor of The Claremont Review of Books, compared the essay to Thomas Paine’s “Common Sense.” Credit Brad Torchia for The New York Times Not that the journal is pro-Trump, mind you. Charles R. Kesler, the editor, said that he had sought out “robust debate,” publishing some Never-Trumpers alongside pro-Trumpers and those who call themselves “anti-anti-Trump.” The institute’s president, Michael Pack, also noted that Claremont’s affiliates — who include the former Bush administration lawyer John Yoo (a strong Trump critic ) and Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas (“one of Trumpism’s leading voices,” as a headline in The Washington Post recently put it ) — were of many minds about the new president. “The Claremont Institute stands for deep, serious thinking about American founding principles,” Mr. Pack said. “We are not simply in the partisan fight.” But some Claremont-watchers take a darker view, saying the institute’s intellectual principles have been, to continue the aviation metaphor, left on the runway. “They have completely abandoned every principle on which they stood and have endorsed a man who seems to have no interest in or knowledge of the Constitution,” Steven B. Smith, a political science professor at Yale, said. “Even though Trump may be completely unhinged, the idea is they can nevertheless kind of slipstream behind him and smuggle their agenda in.” From Leo Strauss to the Beach Boys The Claremont mission, according to the institute’s website, is to “defeat progressivism” and “restore the principles of the American Founding to their rightful, pre-eminent place in American life.” \n  But Mr. Kesler’s office on the manicured campus of Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif., where he is a professor of government, could not seem more distant from the corridors of power, let alone the chaos of actually existing Trumpism. (The institute, founded in 1979, is not affiliated with the college.) The décor is standard-issue professor, down to the desk piled with books relating to American political thought, including his own edition of the Federalist Papers — the top-selling edition in the country, he noted — and an anthology of Woodrow Wilson’s political writings. Wilson, as it happens, is a favorite Claremont bête noire: the founder of the modern “administrative state,” the unelected, unaccountable rule-by-bureaucracy that has, the story goes, usurped the founders’ vision of rule by the people (and which reached its apogee with Barack Obama, Mr. Kesler argued in his 2012 book, “I Am the Change” ). But Mr. Kesler, an unfailingly genial West Virginian, doesn’t seem to mind Wilson’s intellectual company. “I actually like Wilson,” he said. “Well, not politically.” He takes a similarly cheerful view of the ruckus over the essay. He brought up Mr. Kristol’s “intemperate” tweet, but noted that his old friend had recently come to the college for a conference about an essay by the political philosopher Leo Strauss. “A secret Straussian conclave!” Mr. Kesler said with a laugh, then paused. “Don’t call it that.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
