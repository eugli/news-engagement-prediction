Kathi Santora For Harford Magazine At Julie Ellyn Designs: Handmade on Main, all the inventory is indeed individually crafted. \nIt’s a point of pride for Julie Ter Borg that every item in her store, Julie Ellyn Designs: Handmade on Main, is indeed individually crafted. \nHer own line of original sterling silver, gold-filled and precious gemstone jewelry is front and center in the store, which opened last fall on downtown Bel Air’s Main Street. She also created space for two-dozen pop-up shops that feature rotating collections from independent jewelry makers, photographers, fiber artists, woodworkers and decorative painters who typically sell online or at events. \n“I know it sounds sappy but, to me, handmade says ‘love,’” says Ter Borg, who traces her passion for handcrafted items to a childhood spent on her family’s farm, located just northeast of Bel Air. “I spent summers with my grandmother, who taught me to sew. We went crabbing and fishing, and I made things out of shells. I lived a handmade life, not out of necessity but with just a love of nature.” \nTer Borg, 41, spent the first two decades of her career as a health scientist for government agencies while moonlighting as an online jewelry artist. \n“I’ve been making jewelry since grad school,” she says. “It has always been a stress reliever for me.” \nAs online business blossomed, her husband encouraged a career change and helped lay the groundwork to add a hometown retail store to her virtual one. Inside the 2,500-square-foot, French-inspired boutique, she also offers custom jewelry making, children’s birthday parties and girls’ night out parties, along with jewelry making and other classes.
