Some Trump Supporters Are Boycotting Starbucks for Pledging to Help Refugees By Follow @munchies \nEarlier this week, Howard Schultz, the chairman and CEO of Starbucks, wrote a letter to his employees entitled, “Living Our Values in Uncertain Times.” In it, he responded to President Trump’s recent executive order, banning the entry into the US of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. \nSchultz stated that the order called American values into question and then outlined several measures that Starbucks would be taking in response, including hiring 10,000 refugees over the next five years in the 75 countries in which Starbucks does business. Starbucks’ effort would start, Schultz said, with the US, where the company would endeavor to hire those who have “served with US troops as interpreters and support personnel in the various countries where our military has asked for such support.” \nCould anyone really argue with that? \nUh, yup. Would you do business with someone who hated you, tried to kill you, or hired people that HATE you and want to KILL you? #BoycottStarbucks \n— Lori Hendry (@Lrihendry) January 31, 2017 The only thing @Starbucks cares about is selling 10k more cups of over priced coffee. #boycottstarbucks pic.twitter.com/gZGEqdpezc \n— NEWZDIGEST.COM (@aliotta_joe) January 31, 2017 \nShit hit the fan this week when the #MAGA troops took to the Internet and called for a boycott of Starbucks. Welcome to the hashtag (of course there’s a hashtag) #BoycottStarbucks . The rationale of the Trump supporters seems to be that the refugees the coffee corporation seeks to employ will be hired “instead of Americans.” No matter that the letter said the hiring would be spread over 75 countries. Hiring 10k refugees makes liberals feel warm BUT we have homeless vets that need those jobs. #BoycottStarbucks #ReasonsToProtest #MuslimBan pic.twitter.com/wd1ZoW6TvO \n— Pamela Moore (@Pamela_Moore13) January 30, 2017 @CNN @Starbucks I’m sure US citizens that need jobs appreciate ur discrimination against them #DunkinDonutsHasBetterCoffee #BoycottStarbucks \n— Slowly but (@shirlmercy) January 30, 2017 \nNaturally, this being an Internet war, the anti-Trump side is now mobilizing and trying to get #BuyStarbucks to take off.
