By Sylvester Tamang | Updated:  30 AM IST Comments Ravichandran Ashwin has taken two wickets in Bangladesh's first innings. The ongoing one-off Test between India and Bangladesh is turning out as a match with records galore for the Men in Blue. After skipper Virat Kohli surpassed Don Bradman and Rahul Dravid in scoring four double hundreds in successive series, Ravichandran Ashwin too had an eye on a milestone. The offspinner became the fastest to take 250 Test wickets after reaching the tally on day four of the one-off Test against Bangladesh in Hyderabad. He is the 39th bowler to take 250 or more wickets. In addition to this, he is also the fastest to achieve the milestone playing in his 45 Tests. Dennis Lillee was the fastest to reach 250 wickets from 48 matches, followed by Dale Steyn off 49 matches and Allan Donald in 50 Tests. Anil Kumble is 12th on the list and is the second Indian bowler in the top-20 with 250 or more wickets in Tests. Ashwin’s impact for India in 2016 was astounding and the figures from the last five series say it all. If Virat Kohli shut his critics with the bat, Ashwin foxed opposition batsmen with his accuracy and spin. In 2016, Ashwin entered the list of highest wicket-takers in a calender year. He took 71 wickets in 11 Test matches at an impressive average of 21.32. The overall list is headed by Aussie legspinner Shane Warne, who took a staggering 96 wickets in 15 Tests in 2005. However, Ashwin’s feat of 23 instances of five-wicket hauls in 43 Tests is bettered only by Sydney Barnes, who had achieved the distinction in only 27 Tests.
