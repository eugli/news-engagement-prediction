The deal gives Popeyes shareholders $79 per share, representing a 27 percent premium from its average price on Feb. 10. \nRestaurant Brands was created after Burger King, controlled by Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital, bought Tim Hortons in 2014. Since then, the company has been striking deals with local operators to open additional locations around the world. \nRestaurant Brands has more than 20,000 locations globally. Popeyes has more than 2,600.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:58:30.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
