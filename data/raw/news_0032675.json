Jose Fernandez (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 10:48 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 10:48 p.m. ET \nWhen Jose Fernandez died Sept. 25 in a boating accident that killed two other men, he had cocaine and alcohol in his system. \nNow the families of the other two victims in the crash are suing the estate of the late Marlins pitcher. Each family is seeking $2 million. \nAttorney Christopher Royer, who is representing the families of 25-year-old Eduardo Rivero and 27-year-old Emilio Jesus Macias, told the Sun Sentinel Rivero's claim was filed Friday, and will be followed by Macias' claim on Monday. The families had already raised more than $40,000 each through GoFundMe.com pages to cover funeral expenses. \nMORE: Fernandez posthumously named NL Comeback Player of the Year \n\"The Rivero and Macias families are deeply scarred by the loss of their sons,\" Royer stated Friday. \"We remain open to a settlement and are hopeful a prompt resolution can be achieved to spare these families, and that of Jose Fernandez too, from any additional suffering.\" \nThe attorney representing Fernandez's family, Ralph Fernandez, told the Sun Sentinel a settlement is \"highly unlikely\" because it's not known if Fernandez was the one actually driving the boat when it crashed into a jetty off Miami Beach. The U.S. Coast Guard found the boat, \"Kaught Looking,\" around 3 a.m. overturned on the rocky quay. \nFernandez made just over $6.5 million over four years and was a two-time All-Star. The 2013 NL Rookie of the Year was on the brink of a huge payday with his contract expiring following the 2016 season. He could have received up to $30 million per season. His estate is valued between $2 million and $3 million.
