And it’s coming from those organizations. It’s time that you yourself understood that as well.” CNN’s KFile dug up Sebastian Gorka’s conversation with the caller. The president’s definition of the term “fake news” has become increasingly flexible in recent months. In February alone, he has used it to imply that a news outlet is part of the mainstream, is critical of him, or is The New York Times. I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017 Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017 After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 Thank you to Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about. Very nice! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017 \nDespite the Trump administration’s fondness for the term, not all news is fake.
