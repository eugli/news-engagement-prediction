A rawly recorded cymbal tapping opens the track, and it doesn’t venture too far from home, tight as heck across its under-three-minute running time. But man does he pack a lot in there when you listen closely. Which isn’t necessarily the best way to listen this new one from a member of the Internet gone solo. If you take an academic look at the works of Motown’s songwriting mega-geniuses Holland-Dozier-Holland, you’d find all kinds of subtleties: inventive uses of chains as percussion or soul destroying love notes. But if you let one of their Supremes singles pass through the FM dial, or let Lacy’s new track casually unspool on your Soundcloud feed, you get a great song, the barest thing a musician can deliver. Yes, there’s big beautiful strings, a funky bassline, and coos to rival the sweetest of doves. All the meticulousness, though, just serves to make one whole statement of heartbroken soul that sounds modern and new. That’s not so easy to do, but Lacy isn’t too bogged down with the details of invention that he forgets to make an excellent jam.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:01:11.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
