We also know that President Trump is concerned with hands — how large they are, how strong they are — just look at them!\nRead the latest news on U.S. President Donald Trump\nTrump is also a well-known germaphobe. He initially shunned shaking hands with supporters on the campaign trail. As president, protocol compels him to shake a lot of hands, though.\nAnd recently, he’s taken part in a few handshakes that we’ll just call “intense” for now — most recently, a bizarre moment with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday.\n Whether it’s just habit, or a way of asserting his power, Trump has a habit of pulling forcefully on the hand he’s shaking. He’s done it in notable handshakes with Vice President Mike Pence (on election night), with Judge Neil Gorsuch (on the night Trump nominated Gorsuch to the Supreme Court) and this afternoon, with Abe.\nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump shake hands in the Oval Office on Friday. ( BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI / AFP/GETTY IMAGES ) Trump even took time out to compliment Abe’s “strong hands” — or maybe he was just referencing his own.\nBut Trump doesn’t always tug on the hands of those he’s greeting. When Kanye West visited Trump Tower in December, the two dapped like old friends.\nWhile it’s admittedly a small thing, little glimpses into Trump’s thinking can give us an idea of how he handles these situations.
