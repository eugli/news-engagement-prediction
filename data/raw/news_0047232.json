Close share panel Nearly every local authority in England is planning to raise council taxes this year but council leaders are warning services still face \"deep cuts\". \nThe Local Government Association says funding care for increasing numbers of elderly people is forcing up bills. \nIt says many councils are planning tax increases of up to 4.99% but that cuts to libraries, bin collections and other services will still be needed. \nThe government insists it is giving more money to councils. \nSocial care is a lifeline for people like Maureen Edwards, from Surrey, who said that after she had a fall everyday living was \"difficult\". \nShe said: \"They come in and they get me up in the mornings and they wash me and then they sort of bring me downstairs and I have my breakfast. \n\"It's just like normal living now, I'm very grateful for all they've done for me.\" \nBut such services are being put under strain by the ageing population and budget cuts. \nCouncils are struggling to provide help, feed, wash or get people dressed in their own home or to pay for beds in a care home and the burden often falls on families. Is social care getting more money? \nAll councils in England can raise council tax by 1.99% in April without having a local referendum. \nThe 151 social care authorities can increase bills by an extra 3% as long as that money goes on social care. \nThe Local Government Association (LGA) says 147 of these have already agreed or are planning to raise the extra money. And three-quarters are set to introduce the maximum hike. \nHowever, the LGA says further cuts will still be needed as councils are being pushed \"perilously close to the financial edge\". \nWarwickshire County Council leader Izzi Seccombe told the BBC: \"To continue it is really looking like we're cutting into the bones of services that matter to people. \n\"It's not just social care. Things like roads, highways, bus services which are subsidised, libraries, access to leisure centres, waste services, children's services as well.\" \nCouncils spent £16bn last year on services for elderly and disabled people after funding from central government was cut by a third, in real terms, during the last Parliament. \nMs Seccombe said an extra £1.3bn was needed for social care in the next financial year alone. \nAnd while the council tax rises would raise about £600m, she said that would be swallowed up by paying current staff more when the National Living Wage comes into effect. \nMs Seccombe added: \"We need to put social care on a stable footing. \n\"I'm worried about the impact on vulnerable people in our communities. \n\"[And] I'm worried about what that means for carers who will be left picking up the pieces that local authorities will not be able to manage.\" Find out the cost of care in your area Enter a postcode, council name or N Ireland health board Submit search for results Home care What is home care? \nYou stay in your own home while getting help with everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and eating.
