The brand has in fact made a habit of teaming up with the biggest names in style—whether it's a designer label like Alexander Wang or a stylish celebrity like David Beckham . In the spirit of the brand's \"Icons\" collection it launched with Beckham, H&M has now teamed up with one of the biggest pop stars of the moment—The Weeknd—on a collection of the singer's favorite wardrobe staples. Here's your exclusive first look at the new Weeknd x H&M \"Spring Icons\" collection. \nAs you'd expect, the offering is chock full of the kinds of things The Weeknd always wears, whether he's performing a hit single on stage or out on a not-so-secret date with Selena Gomez. We're talking staples like bomber jackets (of which there are two versions), graphic tees, hoodies, slim jeans (both in dark and light-wash varieties), and even one superstar-approved biker jacket. \n\"Every piece is both effortless and fresh, which is just how menswear should be,” he says on the collection. We couldn't agree more, though we can't help but note the business-savvy move of getting his own XO logo into the mix, too. Good thinkin'. \nAnd just like the Weeknd likes 'em, the fits are all styled to be slim, just the way rock stars have been wearing them for decades. There's also a few pleasant surprises in the mix, like a lightweight, double-breasted belted coat—which is basically the perfect kind of statement piece for a man who likes to layer up but spends his winters in the Hollywood Hills. (After growing up in Toronto, can you really blame the guy for enjoying success in the sunshine?) \nThat easy-going coat is the most expensive piece in the offering, and even it will only set you back $79.99. For the most part, pieces are between $14.99 and $49.99, meaning feeling like a Billboard-topping artist doesn't have to mean balling out. Additionally, H&M has given us an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the lookbook for this sure-to-be-coveted offering, which you can check out here: \nThe Weeknd x H&M collection is set to drop at H&M stores around the globe on March 2.
