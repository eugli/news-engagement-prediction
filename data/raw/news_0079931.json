Amongst these picturesque settings lie a group of monuments that bear a living testament to the grandeur of the last empire of India – the Vijayanagara Empire. The Virupaksha Temple is one of the most popular structures at Hampi and was built in a typical Dravidian style by the Chalukyas who ruled the region around the 7th century AD.

An exquisite example of subterranean architecture, Rani ki Vav is 64 meters long, 20 meters wide and 27 meters deep. All of these storeys are carved with more 500 sculptures all of which represent humans, nymphs, gods and the kings in varying forms of skill, grandeur and intricacy, with the central theme being the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu.

The temple has an elaborate and intricate mammoth structure that depicts the chariot of the Sun God replete with 24 carved wheels, each of them 3 m in diameter, pulled by seven horses and guarded by two lions at the entrance that bravely crush elephants.

These magnificent temples built during the reign of Rajaraja were the epitome of the vast religious inclination of these rulers. This temple in the ancient time was note a mere religious center but a full functional business establishment which was served and maintained by a permanent staff of several hundred priests, 400 devadasi and 57 musicians.

The temple complex represents union of another form too, that of Jainism and Hinduism. While the exact date of its inception is hard to assess, it appears in records dating as far back as 1335 AD, which describe it as a group of 85 temples. Falling into ruins, wars and natural hazards, only 22 out of these remain today. The temple complex has three distinct types of carvings, the cult icons, the Apsaras (beautiful maidens) and demi gods that are supposed to guard the temple.

After invaders destroyed and ransacked this Buddhist center of learning, only ruins of Nalanda University is left, which gives a testimony of how advanced and well-structured our ancient education system was.
