The AVA Director-General Dr Yap Him Hoo said: \"The birds were put down due to concerns over public health and safety and not because of complaints over noise. The risk of free-roaming chickens in Singapore being exposed to bird flu is real and significant, as we are a stopover node for migratory wild birds.\" \nThis is pure talking cock and bullshit u-turn by the AVA. From the sequence of events, it is obvious they retrospectively found a scientific excuse to justify their actions. If you acted on noise complaints, admit it and act differently next time. Now AVA attempts to cover up with a cock and bull story about stopping bird flu, it makes AVA look like liars and real lousy ones. AVA thinks Singaporeans are stupid and cannot see through their pathetic attempt to cover backside? \nIf AVA is so dedicated to curbing the spread of bird flu, please go to all our hawker centers which has a huge population of pigeons just nesting on the nearby trees and above our heads. These pigeons, feed on the food scraps once people leave their seats, they defecate everywhere and flap their wings around spreading bacteria and disease. With the huge pigeon population irritating diners at hawker centers, shouldn't AVA take action against these carriers of disease instead of targeting innocent wild chickens instead? \nStop lying AVA and get your act together. Want to stop bird flu, start from our hawker centres first. Singaporeans will confirm rejoice if you get rid of these irritating pigeons disrupting our dining experience. \nJonathan Wee A.S.S.
