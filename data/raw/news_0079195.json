Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA View more sharing options Monday 27 February 2017 18.10 GMT Last modified on Monday 27 February 2017 18.13 GMT \nThe writer and campaigner Jack Monroe has begun libel proceedings against Katie Hopkins in a row over tweets which allegedly imply Monroe defaced or condoned the damage of a war memorial. \nMonroe, who is suing the Mail Online columnist over the posts from May 2015, told the high court in London that the legal dispute had been an “unproductive, devastating nightmare”. \nThe food blogger ’s lawyers claim the tweets caused “serious harm” to Monroe’s reputation. The case, which opened on Monday, centres on public Twitter messages sent by Hopkins to Monroe in May 2015, after a memorial to the women of the second world war in Whitehall was vandalised with the words “Fuck Tory scum” during an anti-austerity demonstration. \nIn a tweet directed to Monroe’s account , Hopkins wrote: “Scrawled on any memorials recently? Vandalised the memory of those who fought for your freedom. Grandma got any more medals?” \nLawyers for Monroe argue that the tweet suggested that the writer had either vandalised a war memorial, and “thereby desecrated the memory of those who fought for her freedom and had committed a criminal act”, or had “condoned or approved” of the criminal vandalisation of a war memorial. \nThe court was told that Hopkins’s original tweet had been a case of mistaken identity, as she had intended to respond to the New Statesman columnist Laurie Penny, who had tweeted from her account @PennyRed that she “[didn’t] have a problem” with the vandalism as a form of protest, but had put Monroe’s then Twitter handle instead. \nIn a later message, Hopkins tweeted: “Can someone explain to me – in 10 words or less – the difference between irritant @PennyRed and social anthrax @MsJackMonroe.” \nMonroe’s lawyers claim that this second tweet bore a “defamatory innuendo meaning” that Monroe “approved or condoned the criminal vandalisation of the women’s war memorial during an anti-government protest”. \nWilliam Bennett, for Monroe, told the judge, Mr Justice Warby: “The claimant’s primary case is that by reason of the seriousness of the allegations and the scale of publication, serious harm to reputation has been caused. \n“A widely published allegation that someone has either vandalised a war memorial or approved of such an act will inevitably cause serious damage to reputation.” \nBennett said the libel was “a particular affront” because part of Monroe’s identity “is as a member of a family closely involved with the armed forces”. \nShortly after Hopkins’ original message, Monroe tweeted in response: “I have NEVER ‘scrawled on a memorial’. Brother in the RAF. Dad was a Para in the Falklands. You’re a piece of shit.” \nMonroe later sent a second message asking Hopkins for a public apology and a donation to a charity in aid of migrants. \nHopkins deleted the first tweet but, said Bennett, “she did not apologise or retract the allegation even though she knew it was false”. \nJonathan Price, for Hopkins, told the judge in written argument that the columnist’s case was that “this relatively trivial dispute arose and was resolved on Twitter in a period of several hours”. \nHe argued that “no lasting harm, and certainly no serious harm”, to Monroe’s reputation resulted from it. Price said Hopkins’s case was that “these proceedings are an unnecessary and disproportionate epilogue to the parties’ otherwise forgotten Twitter row”. \nMonroe rejected Price’s suggestion that rather than the row being the worst thing the blogger had experienced on Twitter, it had in fact been the best thing because it had offered an opportunity to bring the proceedings. \n“These proceedings have been a nightmare,” Monroe told the court. “It has been an 18-month, unproductive, devastating nightmare. \n“I did not want to be here today. I have offered several times though my lawyer to settle these proceedings outside court. This is the last thing that I wanted to be doing.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T20:24:44.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
