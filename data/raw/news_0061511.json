A good way of understanding the real meaning of their results is to compare them with the predicted result, based on national opinion polls. \nCurrent opinion polls give the Conservatives 42 per cent (up 4 percent on the general election); Labour 31 per cent (down 6 per cent); Lib Dems 8 per cent (up 2 per cent); UKIP 13 per cent (unchanged); and the Greens 4 per cent (unchanged). \nUsing the Electoral Calculus model, we can predict the result in each seat using these national figures, and compare them with what actually happened. \nI n Copeland we see that the predicted result was actually for the Conservatives to win the seat, which is what happened . But let's look at the details. \nThe Labour vote held steady, and in fact increased slightly compared with the prediction. The Conservative vote also increased. The main loser was UKIP which lost over half its potential support, mostly to the Conservatives. \nWhat appears to have happened is that UKIP suppporters have been squeezed, with half of them defecting to other parties. On the whole these defections favoured the Conservatives, which furthered increased their majority. \nIt was a different story in Stoke-on-Trent Central. \nI n Stoke, the prediction was that Labour would retain the seat with the Conservatives in second place. Public perception was that UKIP were the real challengers, however, as they came second in the general election. For UKIP to have won they would have had to squeeze Conservative supporters. In the end, this did not happen on a significant scale: only about a tenth of Conservative supporters defected to UKIP. \nUKIP have not broken through to being seen as an alternative to Labour , despite Stoke being a favourable seat to them. Most Labour supporters in Stoke-On-Trent voted Leave in the EU Referendum, and the seat is one of the most pro-Leave and nationalist in the country, without being very left-wing economically. It was a great opportunity for UKIP. \nBut there was no sign of Labour supporters moving over to the party in significant numbers. UKIP picked up a small amount of Conservative support which was enough to move up from a predicted third place, but not enough to win the seat. \nWhat this means nationally is impossible to say with precision. By-elections are a notoriously poor guide to future general election results, although they produce interesting political colour. \nIt is usually a mistake to type by-election vote shares into election predictors, but what we can do is to look at the tactical voting effects which we have observed here. \nWhen UKIP was not in contention for the seat, over half of its supporters defected. But when the Conservatives were seen as outsiders only about a tenth of their natural supporters defected to vote tactically. \nThis is potentially very important. In many seats, UKIP is not going to come first or second, so it matters if UKIP supporters are going to vote tactically and support the Conservatives. \nWe can use these tactical voting (TV) fractions in the Electoral Calculus prediction model, whilst still using the national opinion polls as the base level of currency party support. \nO n current levels of national opinion poll support, Theresa May would be returned to Downing Street with a three-figure majority of 108 if there was a general election next week. Using the same tactical voting effects that happened in the by-elections, the Conservatives would gain another ten seats or so to get a majority around 130. How the Copeland results could map out across the UK \nS o the by-election results are \"good\" news for Labour in that their vote has not collapsed and UKIP is not eating into their support. But the overall picture is still bad for Labour as their prospects for winning a general election are poor. \nThe results appear to look good for the Conservatives, but don't let that fool you: they are actually very good indeed. \nMartin Baxter is the founder of Electoral Calculus, an independent website which provides analysis, comment and predictions of UK general elections, polls and democracy Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T15:37:40.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
