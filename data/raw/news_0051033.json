He had five hits, including a homer, and drove in four runs in six ALCS games versus the Blue Jays in 2015.\nÂ¡Desde tempranito! Kendrys Morales casi listo para su nuevo comienzo en Toronto. #NoOffSeason\nSigue nuestra cuenta de @Snapchat . ðŸ“½ pic.twitter.com/fUtST4FZCj\nâ€” @LasMayores \"He's a proven big leaguer, really good hitter,\" Toronto shortstop Troy Tulowitzki said earlier this week. \"It's nice to have him on your side because facing him with those Kansas City teams, especially in the playoffs, he was a tough at-bat, a tough out. It will be great to see him in our lineup.\"\n'Easy choice' to sign with Toronto As a switch-hitter, Morales provides a bit of diversity in a Blue Jays' lineup that was right-handed heavy through the middle the last couple of seasons.\nHe has a .278 career batting average versus left-handed hitters and a .271 mark against righties.\nJose Bautista said Morales's versatility at the plate would likely play into the bullpen management of opposing teams.\n\"We'll see. With some teams it definitely will, with some teams they go to their regular guys regardless of who's at the plate,\" said Bautista, who played with Morales in winter ball years ago.\n\"More importantly because of the quality of the switch hitter, not just because he's a switch hitter. I think that'll play into how some managers manage their bullpens.\"\nMorales also played six years for the Angels, two with Seattle and one in Minnesota.\nHe said signing with Toronto was \"an easy choice.\"\n\"When I play against the Blue Jays, I liked the way the guys played and they pushed each other,\" Morales said. \"For me every time I played I liked that kind of intensity on the field.\"\nÂ© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Snapchat", "https://t.co/fUtST4FZCj", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoOffSeason?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/LasMayores/status/818843825510682625", "http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-19T19:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:12:55.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
