During the operation, a 22-year-old man with no criminal record, identified only by his first name Theo, was allegedly forced to the ground and beaten. \nA police officer has now been charged with anally raping the young man with a police baton. Theo suffered such serious injuries to the rectum that he needed major emergency surgery and remains in hospital. \nThree other officers were charged with assault. The four officers, who deny the charges, have been suspended. \nThe prosecutor’s office said the police stopped a group of about a dozen people “after hearing calls characteristic of lookouts at drug dealing sites”. During the operation they “attempted to arrest a 22-year-old man”. When he resisted, they used teargas, and “one of them used an expandable baton”, the prosecutor’s office said, without giving details. \nThe incident sparked fury and disturbances in the sprawling estate of 3,000 people on Saturday evening, where a car was set alight and bus shelters were smashed. On Sunday, riot police were sent in to the area. \nÉric Dupond-Moretti, the lawyer for Theo’s family, said: “This is an exceptionally serious case.” He told France Inter radio: “There was blood everywhere, on the walls …” He said the family wanted calm and “they demand justice”. \nBruno Beschizza, the rightwing mayor of Aulnay-sous-Bois, himself a former police officer, said “all light must be shed” on what he called an “unbearable and unacceptable” incident. He said: “The police are there to protect and not to humiliate our fellow citizens.” \nBeschizza described Theo as a “respectable” young man who came from a respectable family, which had been “psychologically destroyed” by what had happened. \nBenoît Hamon, the Socialist presidential candidate, said there must be a diligent and “transparent” inquiry. He tweeted that the police “represent the Republic that protects” and “trust must urgently be restored”. \nFrench police are regularly accused of using excessive force in poor neighbourhoods , and particularly against black and minority ethnic suspects. \nThe death in police custody last summer of a young black man, Adama Traoré , in Beaumont-sur-Oise outside Paris and the slow reaction of authorities, has sparked accusations of police violence and a state cover-up. An investigation is ongoing. \nIn 2005, weeks of riots erupted after two teenagers were electrocuted when they hid in an electricity substation while being chased by police.
