Because besides the main installments which are slated to be released every two years, Disney has also introduced the use of standalone films, which will help to expand the galaxy far, far away. While this originally seemed like a risky experiment, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was a massive box office success, while also faring extremely well with critics. The characters introduced have since been embraced by the fandom, who are disappointed to see that we'll likely never see them again on the silver screen. \nBut Felicity Jones has another idea. The actress, who led Rogue One as newcomer Jyn Erso, thinks that there may just be a way for her to return to the franchise. It's just a matter of how. \nIt was an extraordinary experience and I couldn't have hoped for anything better -- people seemed to really respond to it. It's a great thing to be a part of -- who knows, maybe Jyn could be reincarnated. You could do anything -- maybe she could come back as a hologram! \nIt looks like Jyn Erso's return is possible, it would just likely require some tricky storytelling. And however unlikely it is, Felicity Jones is down to clown in another installment of the iconic franchise. \nThis statement comes to us from HeyUGuys , who had the opportunity to speak with Felicity Jones about her upcoming movie Collide . And while she was likely kidding about her character being somehow reincarnated (she was blown to smithereens in the film's final moments), perhaps she latter suggestion is plausible. She could come back in the form of a hologram. \nWhile we didn't see Jyn Erso record any sort of message during the events of Rogue One , perhaps she left The Rebellion with a final message of hope before her passing. Jyn was instrumental in inspiring The Rebellion gain a new fighting spirit and hope during the events of the film. And it worked, as she and her motley crew of rebels were able to steal the plans for the original Death Star and send it to The Rebels before their untimely deaths. News of Jyn's death would presumably send shockwaves into the organization, but a farewell message could help keep The Rebellion alive until Luke Skywalker shows up on the scene with Han and Leia. \nBut when could this hologram come into play? Perhaps in the main trilogy, as Rey and Finn have a bit of catching up to do with the rest of The Resistance. Maybe an old message from Jyn Erso could be seen in whatever records system they have, leading to a delightful cameo by Felicity Jones. Obviously I'm just spitballing, but it doesn't seem out of the question.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:18:52.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
