Netflix is now on board with it.\nThe online content giant has bought the worldwide rights to \"The Irishman,\" according to Variety . The organized crime movie to be directed by Scorsese will reunite him with Robert De Niro. The two have collaborated previously on eight films, including classics of modern American cinema like \"Taxi Driver,\" \"Raging Bull,\" and \"Goodfellas.\"\nThe new movie is based on \"I Heard You Paint Houses,\" the 2004 book about mob hitman Frank (The Irishman) Sheeran, who claimed in a deathbed confession to have killed Jimmy Hoffa. The project has been in the works since at least 2010.\nIn Charles Brandt's book, Sheeran said the hit was done on the orders of Pennsylvania mobster Russell Bufalino, spurred by Hoffa's interest in regaining his former role as president of the Teamsters. Sheeran claimed he shot Hoffa inside a house in northwest Detroit.\nAccording to a 2015 Detroit Free Press story on various theories surrounding the still-unsolved 1975 disappearance of Hoffa, Oakland County detectives removed floorboards from that house after a Fox News Channel team found indications of blood. An FBI crime lab report found that the blood in the boards wasn't from Hoffa.\nHoffa, 62, went missing in July 1975 from the parking lot of the now-gone Machus Red Fox restaurant in Bloomfield Township.\nSheeran died in 2003 at a nursing home outside Philadelphia.\nFilming of \"The Irishman\" is supposed to begin sometime in 2017. It's not known yet whether Detroit will be used as a location. The movie is not to be confused with the \"Kill the Irishman,\" another mob-themed film that shot in metro Detroit in 2009.\nContact Detroit Free Press writer Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or jhinds@freepress.com.", "external_links": ["http://variety.com/2017/film/news/netflix-buys-martin-scorseses-the-irishman-starring-robert-de-niro-1201993446/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1416801"], "published": "2017-02-23T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:38:40.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
