They kept jumping on each other until they both got tired and slowed to a walk, eventually parting ways with a few extra butt sniffs. \nJust another day at doggy day care. Murray Wilson/ Fairfax NZ. \nHuntaway Stan enjoys the look of his Santa toy. \nThe several dogs at SPCA's newly opened Feilding Doggy Daycare all race between four different outdoor and indoor areas. While they are separated by size and personality, all get on like a house on fire. \nIt's easy to see why manager Claire Kelly said at the end of the day dogs would be returned to their owners absolutely knackered. \nThe centre, which opened on Monday, provides a day boarding service for dogs to encourage socialisation with others, as well as offer basic training and grooming services. Murray Wilson/ Fairfax NZ. \nClaire Kelly plays with Diesel, Georgie and Stan. \nAll profits from the facility will go back into funding SPCA services in the region. \n\"Socialisation is especially important at a young age,\" Kelly said. \"They can get fear aggression if they aren't around other dogs - fight or flight - that's something people get as well.\" \nManawatu SPCA general manager Danny Auger said the first 18 months of a dog's life was a key socialisation period. \n\"Being around other and older dogs they'll pick up little tricks, behaviour and body language,\" he said. Ad Feedback \n\"One of the things we see in the SPCA is dogs aren't getting outside of their home or away from their owners and when they get out they become dangerous around other people. \n\"A lot of dogs also get separation anxiety if they're away from their owners and at home alone all day at a young age.\" \nAt the centre dogs can experience water play along with the hundreds of other toys and gadgets to keep them entertained. They have tugging ropes, tunnels, balls and soft toys to go to town on. \n\"This is the first doggy daycare for SPCA,\" Auger said. \"If this one goes well we're looking at opening one in Whanganui. \n\"Donated dollars are becoming harder and harder to find so we have to look at ways we can bring in business.\" \nKelly said most owners would only use the centre two or three times a week. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:45:43.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
