But in a statement, the Dallas-based group Black Transwomen said she was a performer well-known in the pageant and ballroom community. \nShe was also known as Chyna Doll Dupree, the group said. Her birth name was Walter Flemming. \n\"Chyna Gibson had gone home to New Orleans (like) thousands of other people, (to) celebrate Mardi Gras and be with her family during that festive time,” the group said. “Instead, she was brutally murdered.” \nPolice have released few details on the shooting, and no suspects have been named. \nAuthorities asked anyone with information to call Homicide Detective Robert Barrere at (504) 658-5300. \nFollow Matt Sledge on Twitter, @mgsledge.
