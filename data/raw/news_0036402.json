[We] are very sad about the whole incident. The case did affect the whole force,” Lo said at a passing out parade at the Police College on Saturday – a day after the court ruling.\nHe added that the force would “remain steadfast in their duties” and “committed to upholding the law and order in Hong Kong”.\nThe police chief had said in the past that he would not tolerate and indulge any of his colleagues to break the law and that he would apologise for any wrongdoings of the force.\nWhen asked on Saturday if he would do the same for the officers who were found guilty by the court, Lo said he would not comment at this stage as the seven were considering filing an appeal against the ruling.\nLo then went on to urge members of the public to understand the background of the case as the 79-day mass disobedience movement in 2014 was “unprecedented” in the city.\n“We should respect the entire judicial proceedings. Before all judicial procedures are finished and a final decision is made, I won’t make any comment,” Lo said.\n“[During the Occupy movement] we did not have enough manpower. Each officer worked more than 15 hours daily on average. [They faced] insufficient resources, tremendous pressure, and long hours of work and fatigue,” Lo recalled.\n“My colleagues and I felt heartache and sadness to see our peers being involved in a criminal case and have to bear such consequences when they were exercising their duty at work,” Lo said.\nThe police force was gripped by emotions ranging from dismay to open outrage on Friday as news of the verdict broke.\nMany frontline officers condemned the jail term and described the sentence as “unfair” speculating that there was a political agenda behind the case.\nA police union said the jail term went “beyond acceptance level” and that it would raise money for the seven officers to ease their financial burden brought about by the incident.\nLo said although he should be responsible to all citizens in the city, he was also the commissioner leading 29,000 officers and that it was necessary for him to support his fellow men and their families.\nSources said that representatives from the work union visited the seven in Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre on Saturday morning to understand their views.\nPolitiHK Social Strategic, a pro-government activist group, will march from Chater Garden in Central to the police headquarters in Wan Chai on Saturday afternoon to protest the sentence.\nThe group expects 260 people to join the rally.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:20:09.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
