Around 400 bison — sometimes colloquially called American buffalo — are being held in a park facility and are slated to follow the others to slaughter in the coming weeks. Officials said they want to reduce the population by 1,300 this winter.\nWilliam Campbell via Getty Images Female bison in Yellowstone Park. Yellowstone has been culling bison annually since 2000, when the Interagency Bison Management Plan was crafted in response to disputes between the state of Montana and the National Park Service about bison roaming outside Yellowstone boundaries.\nWildlife biologists say there’s not enough space inside the park to support more than a few thousand animals without causing overgrazing and potential mass starvation.\nMontana law allows only “very limited” numbers of bison to migrate outside park boundaries, the National Park Service says. State and federal laws prohibit transporting wild bison anywhere, other than slaughterhouses and research facilities, for fear they’ll transmit brucellosis — a bacteria that can cause pregnant cows to abort their fetuses — to domestic cattle. Additionally, ranchers don’t want bison eating grass they use to feed their cattle, according to Reuters.\nWilliam Campbell via Getty Images Bison at Yellowstone's Stevens Creek capture facility, awaiting shipment to slaughter, in 2014. The first bison shipped to slaughter this year were part of a group of 40 that had been held at a quarantine facility at Montana’s Fort Peck Indian Reservation, with the intention of establishing a herd there, The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. But state livestock officials and federal animal health agents opposed the transfer, and the group’s 15 females — which are at higher risk for brucellosis than males — were loaded onto trucks taken to slaughter on Wednesday, the AP reports.\nAs a compromise, the 25 males were sent to a U.S. Department of Agriculture corral, where they are set to be quarantined and eventually transferred to Fort Peck. One of the bulls was shot on Tuesday after breaking a leg.\nWilliam Campbell via Getty Images Bison at Yellowstone's Stevens Creek capture facility, awaiting shipment to slaughter, in 2014. There’s never been a documented case of a bison actually transmitting brucellosis to cattle. However, the National Park Service maintains that it could happen, and says it hasn’t because of concerted efforts to keep bison and cattle apart.\nIn order to uphold the terms of the Interagency Bison Management Plan, the government organizes the killing of hundreds of bison every year. Hunters outside of park boundaries kill some, and others are captured and sent to slaughter — a process that animal advocates slam as stressful and traumatic for the bison. The meat is distributed to various Native American tribes.\nThe annual cull has plenty of vocal opponents, including animal protection groups and concerned members of the public. Even the National Park Service itself denounces the practice as outdated, and says a new management plan is needed.\n“Many people are uncomfortable with the practice of culling bison, including the National Park Service,” Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Dan Wenk said in a statement last year. “The park would gladly reduce the frequency and magnitude of these operations if migrating bison had access to more habitat outside the park or there was a way to transfer live bison elsewhere.”\nNot everyone agrees on what to do. The National Park Service touts a quarantine program as a way to save some animals and transfer them to other protected areas.\nBut the Buffalo Field Campaign, a group that advocates for wild bison, says quarantine is no solution. The group condemns the quarantine process — which involves separating family groups and forcing the wild animals to live in captivity — as inhumane. Even in quarantine, bison that test positive for the disease are killed.\nHowever, both the park service and the Buffalo Field Campaign seem to agree that bison should be given greater freedom to roam outside Yellowstone boundaries, as other wildlife species can do.\n“Over the last two decades, nearly 20 livestock operators in the three states surrounding Yellowstone discovered brucellosis in their animals,” the National Park Service website states. “In each case, wild elk transmitted the disease. However, the state of Montana allows elk to move freely outside Yellowstone: a freedom that bison deserve, but have been denied.”\nDo you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post?

The backdrop is the richrainforest of the Gunung Palung National Park, in West Kalimantan, one of the few protected orangutanstrongholds in Indonesian Borneo. The orangutan has returned to feast on the crop of figs. He has amental map of the likely fruiting trees in his huge range, and he has already feasted here. Tim knew hewould return and, more important, that there was no way to reach the top – no route through the canopy –other than up the tree. But he had to do three days of climbing up and down himself, by rope, to place inposition several GoPro cameras that he could trigger remotely to give him a chance of not only a wide‐\nangle view of the forest below but also a view of the orangutan’s face from above. This shot was the onehe had long visualized, looking down on the orangutan within its forest home.\nShare this slide:\nTim Laman/Wildlife Photographer Of The Year More: Health And Medicine Animal Rights Montana National Park Service Yellowstone National Park Suggest a correction Comments Close SUBSCRIBE TO & FOLLOW TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS How will Donald Trump’s first 100 days impact YOU?
