Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), according to the Chicago Tribune . \nEllison's candidacy boasts the support of Sanders , as well as Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), while Perez is said to have former Attorney General Eric Holder and Joe Biden (D-Del.) in his corner. \nThe election will be held this weekend in Atlanta, and also includes several other candidates including Sally Boynton Brown (D-Idaho) and former Chairman Gov.
