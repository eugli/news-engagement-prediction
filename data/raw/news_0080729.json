If they're going to give me a fine for not fitting my seatbelt, that's just being racist, to the fat people,\" she said. FACEBOOK/SUPPLIED \nThe woman said seatbelts weren't made with overweight people in mind. \n\"What do they think the whole world is skinny or something? What about the big people? \nREAD MORE: * New plane designed to accommodate overweight passengers \n\"I could actually sue, like what if I crash, and something happens to me because the seatbelt couldn't go around me.\" \nAalysia Tupou, who filmed the video of her sister surreptitiously, says her sister's complaint was felt by many.\" \n\"I think my sister said things a lot of other people are thinking,\" she said. \nTupou also explained how the video came to be in the first place. Ad Feedback \n\"My sister, brother and I were on our way to the local warehouse, we are always having discussions on a lot of things, on this day, the subject was seatbelt because there was police in front of our car.\" \n\"I told her 'put your seat belt on before we get pulled over' and she said 'no point I can't fit it'. \nTupou then asked her sister what she would say to the police and started filming. \nShe was surprised when the video was picked up by Facebook group The Uce Hub and the Daily Mail in February . Neither of the outlets asked her for permission, and the video was first uploaded in June of 2016. \nHer sister did not know she was being filmed and \"hated\" the video. \nSenior Sergeant Jan Craig, acting road policing manager in Wellington, told Stuff that everyone should wear a seatbelt. \n\"Not wearing a seatbelt is now a contributing factor to fatal injuries on a similar level to speed and alcohol. That is unacceptable.\" \n\"The latest study that looked at the injury risk reduction effects of seatbelts found the that front seat occupants have 60 per cent reduction in the risk of sustaining a fatal or serious injury if they crash while wearing their seatbelt, and for rear seat passengers a 44 per cent reduction in risk.\" \nShe said if fit was an issue that should be remedied as soon as possible. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:58:18.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
