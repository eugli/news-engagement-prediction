Da Kitchen serves Hawaiian and other local food items. “We are aggressively pursuing a new Honolulu location,” Brown said. “We are very excited about returning to Oahu and hope to be open in the next couple of months.” The new Oahu restaurant would also be called Da Kitchen, she said. The restaurant currently has two locations in Hawaii, both on Maui — Da Kitchen Cafe in Kahului and Da Kitchen Express in Kihei. It also has a location in San Francisco called Da Chavo’s Kitchen, which offers a menu of Mexican and Hawaiian food items. In 2014, Da Kitchen opened a “summer pop-up” in the former Hard Rock Cafe building across from the Hawaii Convention Center, which is now home to a Honolulu Coffee Co. cafe and experience center. Da Kitchen also once had a location in the Moiliili area of Honolulu that closed in 2013. Da Kitchen, which has been featured on “Diners, Drive ins and Dives,” also will be on the Travel Channel’s new series called “Trip Testers” on Monday at 9 p.m. Duane Shimogawa covers energy, commercial real estate and development for Pacific Business News.
