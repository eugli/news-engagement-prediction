Handout photo \nMANILA, Philippines â€“ Rudy Roque and his Navy-Standard Insurance riders will try to strengthen their hold on the top four spots when they return to the road in Stage 7 of the 2017 LBC Ronda Pilipinas on Thursday. \nKinetix Lab-Army's Cris Joven is the primary challenger to the Navy cyclists in the 227-kilometer stage that starts at the Camarines Sur Watersports Complex in Pili and ends in Daet, Camarines Norte. \nTwo days after ruling the 46.6-km Pili-San Jose Stage 6 Team Time Trial, Navy sets its sights on the individual race as it looks to devise a plan to protect their grip on the first four slots. \nRoque still holds the overall individual lead and the LBC red jersey, followed by teammates Ronald Lomotos, Daniel Ven Carino, and defending champion Jan Paul Morales. \nRoque has clung to the overall lead since Day 1. After six stages, he has an aggregate time of 18 hours, 12 minutes, and 48 seconds, while Lomotos, Carino and Morales are in second, third and fourth places with times of 18:13:47, 18:14:43 and 18:15:51, respectively. READ: Navymen pulling away in the overall team race \nJoven is currently in fifth place with a time of 18:15:51. It has been a remarkable ride for Joven, who was in 24th place in Stage 1 but jumped to No.9 after Stage 3, and rose all the way to No. 5. \nRounding up the top 10 are: Go for Gold's Elmer Navarro (18:17:57), RC Cola-NCR's Leonel Dimaano (18:18:01), Go for Gold's Ismael Grospe, Jr. (18:19:02), Army's Lord Anthony del Rosario (18:19:44) and Go for Gold's Jonel Carcueva (18:20:33). \nNavy coach Reinhard Gorrantes admits that no lead is safe in the Ronda Pilipinas. \n\"It is still too early to tell and we have no way to find out who will win this race,\" he said. \"That is why we have to protect it well and hope we can widen the gap as the race progresses.\" \nFor Gorrantes, the next three stages will be the most crucial. \"We'll probably get the idea who will win after it,\" he said. \nStage 7 will circle to some parts of Quirino and Quezon province, before heading to Daet. Stage 8, meanwhile, is a 183-km lap that unfolds in Daet and concludes in Unisan, Batangas. Stage 9 will be a criterium race at the Paseo in Sta. Rosa, Laguna. \nThe 31-year-old Morales, who is trying to become the first back-to-back Ronda Pilipinas champion, believes that the 40-km individual time trial Stage 12 in Iloilo City on March 2 will prove to be the decisive lap. \n\"The ITT in Iloilo will be a little difficult, because it is long,\" he said. \"There's a chance you could lose somewhere around four minutes there.\" \n\"If you want to win this year, you have to have a six minute lead after the ITT,\" he added \nJoven is expected to make his move and challenge the powerhouse Navymen as he continues his search for his first Ronda crown. \n\"I still have eight stages to catch up,\" he said. \"I'm still optimistic about my chance.\" \nFor more   website. \nShare", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:37:27.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
