Out of respect for those proceedings we are unable to discuss the details.\"\nAfter choking on the popcorn, Veenhof was taken to a hospital where he was put into a coma, his statement of claim says.\nHe went through procedures that included a tracheostomy -- where an incision is made in the windpipe -- and tendon release surgery, the document alleges.\nHe also alleges he went through a variety of other treatments including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and personal support work, the statement of claim says.\nCineplex has denied Veenhof's allegations and says in court documents that its employees were not negligent.\nIn a statement of defence, the company says that on the night of the incident, someone who witnessed Veenhoff's collapse called 911 and was on the phone with a dispatcher. It said that Veenhof was breathing but was unresponsive.\nA Cineplex employee took instructions from ambulance attendants with regard to how to treat Veenhof, the statement of defence says.\n\"At all times, the instructions were being provided by the ambulance attendants and Cineplex employees were relaying the plaintiff's condition to them,\" the document says.\nFirefighters arrived and took over the medical emergency treatment of Veenhof, Cineplex argues.\n\"All medical care that was provided to the plaintiff until he was taken to the hospital was under the instruction of medical personnel. The defendants therefore deny that it breached any administration of any emergency medical care as it was always under the instruction of emergency medical personnel.\"\nCineplex further argues that Veenhof was under the influence of marijuana at the time, which it alleges contributed to his collapse in the movie theatre.\nThe document also alleges Veenhof's girlfriend failed to provide immediate first aid to the man and failed to call an ambulance in a timely manner.\n\"He failed to use proper care for his own safety, especially in light of his usage of an illegal substance,\" the document says. \"At the time of the alleged accident, his faculties of observation, perception, judgement and self control were impaired and he was the author of his own misfortune.\"\nNone of the allegations in the case have been proven in court.\nThe lawsuit is set to go to a civil trial in Kitchener in March.\nRelated Stories Cineplex Entertainment to buy SAW, coin-operated ride and game company Beds, eats and massaged feet: the world's most unusual movie theatre experiences Cineplex to open panoramic theatres in Toronto, Edmonton, Vancouver", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T21:26:08.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
