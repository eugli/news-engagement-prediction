Son of late restaurateur proves he’s the real deal share Max Kuller The D.C. restaurant industry is still mourning the 2014 death of Mark Kuller, the driving force behind Proof, Doi Moi, and Estadio. Now his son, Max, is carefully carrying on the legacy of his dad’s hospitality empire while striving to take the brand to new heights. Kuller, who entered the restaurant world a decade ago by waiting tables at Proof, recently sat down with Eater to discuss some of the challenges he’s faced as president of parent company Fat Baby, Inc. — like staying relevant, filling the void created by the departure of original star chef, Haidar Karoum, and most importantly, attempting to make his late father proud. “I think my dad would be happy with where we are now,” he says. “He wanted our restaurants to be the best they could be in the categories they are in.” Legacy Building The goal Kuller’s wine connoisseur father envisioned when opening Estadio was to create the best Spanish wine list in the U.S., and amassing a collection of rare Riojas (some dating back to 1925) at one point put it at to the top of that particular class. Its “Sherry Festival” promotion (timed around the National Cherry Blossom Festival) will be back in a big way this year, Kuller reveals. Proof general manager Brent Kroll is spreading his wings by debuting a new wine bar in Shaw later this spring in partnership with Fat Baby. “It’s Brent’s baby, but we are helping him get it up,” Kuller said, adding that it will serve as a “prototype” for other potential bar projects in the city. “D.C. has ascended way faster in terms of places to dine than drink,” he estimates. Keeping the Momentum Going Estadio has weathered the storm of the explosive 14th Street restaurant corridor — literally. “It gets an uptick in business when it rains,” Kuller said. “It’s that neighborhood place where people go because it’s cozy and warm.” [Official] He compares Estadio to 2 Amys in Cathedral Heights — his hands-down, favorite place within D.C’s booming restaurant community. “We think Estadio has carved out that same neighborhood feel on 14th Street,” he says. Don’t expect to see Estadio replicated around town: Kuller says sparking that “same fire” elsewhere within the same market would be tough. Developing a spinoff, however, is one possibility. In an effort to rekindle creativity, Kuller is taking the team to Spain this May for some first-hand inspiration and “R & D.” The trip will bring things full circle; José Andrés advised Max and Mark Kuller on spots to visit in Spain prior to their opening Estadio in 2010. Now Kuller can’t stay away from the country, specifically Madrid; he just went for New Year’s Eve and says he’s “fallen in love” with the city. Domestic travels are also in the works, with Fat Baby making an appearance at the Charleston Food and Wine Festival. P roving Ground Proof has proven its staying power in Chinatown, turning 10 this year and remaining busy despite a surge of new restaurants at neighboring CityCenterDC. Karoum’s exit, though, was a shock to the system. “Having a departure like that, you need to do some soul searching,” Kuller said. “You could say you had a great run and put energy elsewhere, or put everything in and get even better.” [ John R./Yelp ] He went with the latter, plucking rising chef Austin Fausett from Trummer's on Main in Clifton, Va., last year to revitalize Proof. “Proof started with the same buzz as maybe your Dabneys, Kinships and Tail Up Goats have gotten in the past year. But after a decade no one remembers Proof started with that same feeling,” he said. Some Fausett-led changes include replacing soda guns with a curated artisan soda program, rewriting the beer list, and launching brunch service — for the first time ever — on March 12. “Proof wants a Michelin star. They want three stars back in local pubs, at the least,” said Kuller. “Not because we think we are the best. We want to re-earn those things.” Stargazing One Fat Baby restaurant has already caught whiff of Michelin. Doi Moi, its sleek Vietnamese-themed property in Logan Circle, last year received a nod in the Bib Gourmand guide. Perhaps even more of a compliment is the fact Massimo Bottura — the owner of one the best restaurants in the world — has been a customer. Kuller admits the Southeast Asian restaurant, which he says was partly inspired by San Francisco-based The Slanted Door, was “ahead of its time” in terms of size and scope when it opened in 2013. [ R. Lopez ] Its racy downstairs cocktail lounge, 2 Birds 1 Stone — with its funky cartoon menus and Kama Sutra-themed bathroom decor — is still run by bar director Adam Bernbach, hired by Mark Kuller back in 2009. The past six months have been about finding a clear identity for Doi Moi with a new chef, Kuller said. He now thinks the menu has a “greater logic” and flow, with luxurious dishes served alongside fun family-style offerings. A pop-up sandwich shop was recently added to the mix on weekends. On the Lookout While no new full-service restaurants are in the works, Kuller plans to keep his dad’s nimble approach when the time is right to expand. For example, when Mark Kuller was looking to add a second restaurant after Proof, the original plan was to open an Italian venture. “But when we found the Estadio space ... the rawness seemed like it would be a great tapas bar,” Max Kuller said. That, and two new Italian projects in the neighborhood had just been announced. Kuller believes he inherited his dad’s instinct to react when a rare opportunity comes along. Case in point: although he usually keeps vegetarian, during a recent trip to a Patagonian farm, Kuller says he took a bite of lamb that had been roasting in front of him. The impetus? Kuller maintains his dad always wanted to open a 30-seat steakhouse. “If we found that space we would go that route,” he says. For now, Max Kuller is focusing on prepping for the 3rd annual “Ga May” fundraiser , a month-long promotion during which local restaurants, stores and wine distributors contribute to cancer research. Proceeds from sales of wines featuring gamay grapes flow through to the Lustgarten Foundation, a group focused on curing pancreatic cancer; Mark Kuller died from the same disease.
