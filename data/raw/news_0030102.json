Related John Oliver Takes on the Trump Era: The Rolling Stone Interview TV's sharpest political satirist on crafting comedy in dark times, that 'Drumpf' gag and where we go from here in our candid cover story \nThe Valentine's Day-related banter was quick and harmless. \"I might not have a wife tomorrow,\" Oliver quipped, trading stories with Meyers about keeping their partners' expectations low around February 14th. \"Thoughtful card: That's tangible affection in written form,\" Oliver said. \"What gift could compete with that? I would argue none.\" \nThe conversation became more pointed when it turned to President Obama, who has been photographed on vacation in the British Virgin Islands. \"This might be controversial, [but] I'm a little sick of seeing photos of President Obama on vacation with Richard Branson,\" Oliver said. \"Just tone it down with the kitesurfing pictures.\" \nOliver acknowledged that the former President deserved a vacation. But, he continued, \"America is on fire. I know that people accused him of being out of touch with the American people during his Presidency. I'm not sure he's ever been more out of touch than he is right now … we're losing public schools! … You're fiddling while Rome burns!\" \nLast Week Tonight With John Oliver returned for its fourth season on HBO on Sunday.
