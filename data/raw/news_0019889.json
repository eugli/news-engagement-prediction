It is the lack of option that brings us to where we are that we cannot make a good choice,” Mr. Saraki said. \n“No provision was made, in either the 2016 or 2017 budget, for the rehabilitation of the Abuja airport runaway… one will be wondering how such kind of decisions are arrived at.” \nMr. Saraki, however, promised that provision will be made for the completion of the Suleja-Minna road. \nWhen contacted on Saturday, Mr. Omisore added that although the executive did not include the repair of the runway in the budget proposition, but since it is an appropriation, the legislature would look into it. \n“(The) executive did not include it but since it is just an appropriation, the National Assembly will consider including it,” he told PREMIUM TIMES. \nThe Abuja airport has been subject of controversies in the past weeks, following the resolve of the Nigerian government to close the airport for repairs. \nThe arrangement by the Nigerian government during the repairs is that airlines would land at the Kaduna airport and passengers would be transported in secure buses from Kaduna to Abuja.
