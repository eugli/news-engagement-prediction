PHOTO | COURTESY By CORRESPONDENT \nThe young couple who held a wedding worth Sh100 on Saturday got a major financial boost from a well wisher who was touched by their desperate situation. \nDiamond Properties Merchants gave the newlyweds – Wilson Wanjohi and Ann Muhonja – a plot and a greenhouse worth Sh1 million in Isinya, Kajiado County. \nThe investment includes an eighth acre plot valued at Sh500,000 and a Sh320,000 greenhouse and capsicum crop with a potential return of Sh250,000. \nIt was a surprise for the couple who were lost for words after discovering what the invitation was all about. \nMr Wanjohi, 27, said the plot and greenhouse would help them stabilise financially as they start a new family. \nHAND OF GOD \n“It is the hand of God,” said Wanjohi, who sells apples for a living in Kasarani. “We did not even know that we were coming here to receive this plot; we were just told to get into the vehicle and driven here,” he said. \nSpeaking to the Sunday Nation after the event, Mr Wanjohi said he would start working on the green farm as soon as possible even though he would be forced to commute from his current residence at Kasarani. \n“The greenhouse is very good, I intend to start farming immediately even as I plan how to relocate to this area. I really thank Kenyans of goodwill who have really assisted us,” he said. \nSpeaking during the handover of the investment, Diamond Properties Sales and Marketing Manager Edwin Khiranga said the property investment company’s management responded to the heartwarming story of Wanjohi and Muhonja who wedded at the Community Christian Worship church in Kasarani a week ago with only two rings valued at Sh50 each. \n“We want to start them off in family life with an investment as distant farmers and land owners,” said Mr Khiranga.
