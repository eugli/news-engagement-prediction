This wind that started blowing through the Rift Valley is a wind of change,” he said. \nIn remarks perceived to be directed towards Mr Ruto, who has indicated that he will vie for the presidency in 2022, Mr Moi said such talk was unnecessary since matters of the future depended on the will of God. \n“Don’t come here telling us about 2022 when our people are battling insecurity and hunger among other pertinent challenges. Tell us about what’s in store for us today, the same way our daily prayer in the Bible says, ‘give us our daily bread today’,” said Mr Moi. \nHe went on: \"We are demanding peace today, employment for our jobless youths and infrastructure today. I also want to remind those talking about 2022 about the Kiswahili saying “Kutangulia sio kufika . (Being ahead does not make you a winner).” \nMr Moi last week announced Kanu would support President Kenyatta’s re-election, following the party’s national executive committee meeting. \nThe senator has also held a meeting with President Kenyatta and retired President Daniel arap Moi. Mama Ngina Kenyatta has also visited Mr Moi at his Kabarak home. \nIn Kericho, Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter said Jubilee was the party to beat in the South Rift, adding that no other parties could match its strength in the region. \n“I am telling you (DP Ruto) that the people of Kericho and the South Rift region are behind you and the President one hundred per cent. Anyone looking for a reason to support Jubilee should be thankful for the peace that the government has brought to this country,” said Mr Keter. \nPERFORMANCE RECORD \nWhen the Deputy President rose to speak however, he steered clear of his rivalry with Mr Moi, only saying he was confident that Jubilee would win this year’s election by a landslide and dismissing the opposition as playing catch-up to the ruling party. \n“We are going to the election armed with our scorecard and our performance record, which we are very proud of and we are going to face the electorate knowing very well that our score card speaks for itself and we have delivered on most of our pledges,” said Mr Ruto. \nHe said the Jubilee government was unrelenting in its quest to ensure that this year’s election will not only be free and fair, but also peaceful, adding that security agencies would not hesitate to punish any politician found engaging in hate speech. \n“We have a duty individually and collectively to ensure that the next election will be free, fair and peaceful. The government will ensure that this happens by all means necessary. All aspirants must make this their business as well because we do not want war,” he added. \nKericho Governor Paul Chepkwony said Jubilee had brought development to the country across all sectors and called on Kenyans to give President Kenyatta and Mr Ruto a second term. \nProf Chepkwony, who is running for a second term in office, called on Mr Ruto and the Jubilee Party leadership to do whatever is necessary to ensure that the party nominations slated for next month will be free, fair and transparent. \n“My support for you is unwavering. And as you journey to the presidency in 2022, I will stand solidly behind you. You gave us an assurance that during the nominations there will be no favoured candidate and this is very important,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:21:41.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
