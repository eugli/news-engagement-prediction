It doesn’t seek to punish its characters or the audience, instead choosing focus on what’s good about human life, even in its folly and its error. It’s witty without being arrogant or seeming pretentious, smart without being condescending, and romantic without being saccharine. It’s a very rare movie, indeed. Nothing short of a masterpiece by Nick PAF Have you ever wanted to relive a moment in your life over and over until it was perfect? Have you ever wanted to live life the way you wanted it to be? About Time is exactly that. Life. The beautiful story of life. When young Tim discovers that the men in his family can travel through time, he uses it to find one thing: love. After twenty minutes or so of learning and film, he meets the beautiful Rachel McAdams who captures every scene she’s in, giving an Oscar worthy performance. You get to see them blossom into a surprisingly realistic romance that almost everyone can relate to through their surprisingly human relationship banter. Slowly though, you begin to wonder, “What’s going on?” “Why is everything moving like this?” “Why is this happening?” The story seems to dissolve. But as the story comes closer and closer to the end, you discover that this movie isn’t capturing a scripted story written to be a movie. It’s capturing life itself. This movie portrays the beautiful story of everyday life that we all live every single day through our own eyes. You feel as if you are Tim, falling in love with Rachel McAdams’ character Mary and by instinct laugh and cry as their story unfolds. The time travel takes a backseat to the events that play out on screen and only progress the fantastic chain of events forward when it is reintroduced. About Time is far more than a movie could ever dream of being. It is not a film, it is the beauty of the life we live everyday that we seem to take for granted. After watching this, you’ll want to go out and kiss your husband/wife/girlfriend/boyfriend, spend time with your family, and simply be. About Time is nothing short of a masterpiece. 10/10 Quite Amazing by Lcolells51 I originally thought this was going to be a romantic movie, so when my girlfriend dragged me to this, I wasn’t looking forward to the film. However, after eating my popcorn I found this movie to be quite enjoyable. It wasn’t just a corny romance with a nerd and a beautiful woman, it was love for a family. Subtly, the movie conveyed a message about living life to the fullest, “Carpe Diem” as the romans would say. Bill Nighy plays a wonderful father figure who everyone would want. The ending is possibly the best part and a surprise that was welcomed and made the movie even more powerful. I rate this five stars for just a superb message and entertaining love story.
