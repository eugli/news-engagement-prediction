Another wrote: \"Amazing... but they are making such a mess on my car.\" \nThe starling population has fallen by over 80% in the UK in recent years, meaning they are now on the critical list of UK birds most at risk. \nThe decline is believed to be due to the loss of permanent pasture and increased use of farm chemicals, according to the RSPB.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:30:11.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
