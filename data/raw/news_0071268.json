Keep smiling! Mourinho of all people melts hearts with touching message to Ranieri \nThose criticisms come at a time when Wenger’s future has never been so uncertain, with his contract expiring in the summer and a growing sense he’ll move on when it does. That would see the Arsenal hierarchy seeking a new manager for the first time in over 20 years and among those linked with the vacancy are current Newcastle manager Benitez and Atletico Madrid general Simeone. According to Hamann, both would be upgrades on Wenger . \n‘Arsenal have to face reality to make a decision to not be fooled by mistakes from the past. \n‘Arsene Wenger transformed the club and, arguably, changed the entire Premier League. He’ll be as disappointed as anyone at the capitulation [to Bayern Munich] last Wednesday, but now he’s got to decide whether he’s still the best man for the job. Arsenal’s only hope of winning a trophy this season is in the FA Cup (Getty) \n‘A different manager at Arsenal could get more out of these players. Rafa Benítez and Diego Simeone are managers who could both add great value to that team.’ \nArsenal’s season could still prove successfully says Hamann, who played for Bayern Munich, Liverpool and Newcastle among others, however by the club’s standards they are not performing to a high enough level. \n‘Arsenal should finish in the top four and could win the FA Cup. Other teams – like Liverpool – would jump at the chance for that. \n‘But you’ve got to put the season in prospective. The manner of Arsenal’s defeats have been the most disappointing thing. Arsenal were thrashed 5-1 by Bayern Munich in the Champions League (Getty) \n‘Arsenal have won two FA Cups in three years and should be in another semi-final now barring an embarrassing result to Lincoln. But beating Preston, Southampton and two non-league sides to get to a semi-final shouldn’t paper over the cracks which have been evident again this season. \n‘I fancied Arsenal to do something in November but, within five days of December, I knew that this crop of players weren’t going to win the Premier League or the Champions League. \n‘They threw away a lead and lost two games to Everton and Man City in the space of five days. Top teams don’t do that. Arsenal fixtures \nLiverpool (A) – Sat 4 Mar Bayern Munich – Champions League (H) – Tue 7 Mar Lincoln – FA Cup (H) – 11/12 Mar West Brom (A) – Sat 18 Mar Manchester City (H)– Sat 1 Apr West Ham (H) – Tue 4 Apr Crystal Palace (A) – Sat 8 Apr \n‘When Arsenal come up against the big teams they always find a way to come up short. This team doesn’t have enough leaders, heart, steel or character to do it when the chips are down. \n‘Technically they are as good as any side in the Premier League, but they simply don’t produce the goods.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:32:32.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
