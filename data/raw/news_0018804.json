Georges-Hunt, an All-ACC selection as a senior last year, will be signed to a 10-day contract by the Miami Heat, according to multiple reports.\nAfter going undrafted and playing for the Brooklyn summer league team and with Boston in the preseason, Georges-Hunt has played this season in the D-League with the Maine Red Claws and was selected to the D-League all-star game this week. He is averaging 16.4 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4.2 assists in 32 games, 27 of which he has started.\n“We like the fact that he’s a combo guard, he can play off the ball, he can handle the ball, he can make plays, he can shoot from deep,” Spoelstra told the Palm Beach Post . “He’s a very competitive kid. Those things tend to play well with us. We’ll have to fast track him as much as possible.”\nGeorges-Hunt will be the first former Tech player to make an NBA roster since Glen Rice Jr. made his debut in November 2013.\nAccording to the Palm Beach Post, Georges-Hunt will join the team in New York and would be available to play Friday against Brooklyn.", "external_links": ["http://heatzone.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2017/02/08/heat-to-sign-d-league-marcus-georges-hunt-to-10-day-contracte/"], "published": "2017-02-09T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T09:39:48.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
