Pete Evans and Manu Feildel. Picture: Julie Kiriacoudis\nMeanwhile, the 7.30pm battle between My Kitchen Rules and Married at First Sight has grown increasingly tight.\nLast night, My Kitchen Rules averaged 1.075 million viewers across the five capital cities — good enough to win its timeslot but the worst ratings result in its eight year history.\nSeven’s cooking show was a mere 11,000 viewers ahead of Nine’s wedding show on 1.064 million.\nMarried , which featured the first round of commitment ceremonies, was a clear winner in Sydney with 340,000 viewers compared to Kitchen ’s 284,000.\nmedia_camera Joanne Lees with her half-sister Jess, who lives in Sydney. Picture: 60 Minutes\n60 Minutes posted solid figures for Liz Hayes’ special report on Joanne Lees’ return to Australia.\nNine’s flagship current affairs show averaged 893,000 viewers across the five capital cities, with Lees providing an emotional update on her life since running for her life from outback attacker Bradley John Murdoch, who murdered her partner Peter Falconio after flagging the couple down on an NT highway.\nFalconio’s body has never been found, but Murdoch was found guilty over his death and attempted kidnapping of Lees.\nIn a happy footnote to the sometimes harrowing report, Lees revealed she had bonded with her half-sister Jess, who now lives in Sydney.\nTen’s high hopes for 24: Legacy , a reboot of the thriller series made famous by Kiefer Sutherland, were dashed.\nThe new version, with Corey Hawkins ( The Walking Dead ) as former army ranger Eric Carter who must stop an impending terrorist attack, averaged a poor 333,000 viewers.
