Dr Shahmalak, best known for his work with celebrity hair transplant patients like Calum Best at Crown Clinic close to Manchester Airport, was reunited with Kanwal on a trip to Karachi last week where she proudly showed off her new eyebrows and eyelashes which have grown back following his reconstruction work two years ago. Kanwal lost her nose in the attack at the hands of a jealous pal Before the surgery, she used a black marker to give the impression that she still had eyebrows. Dr Shahmalak is one of only a handful of surgeons in the world who can carry out eyelash and eyebrow transplants. In the UK, he performs these operations on women who have wrecked their brows or lashes through over-plucking or misusing false eyelashes. Kanwal, now planning fresh surgery on her nose, has got married since first being helped by Dr Shahmalak. Kanwal said: 'I cannot thank the doctor enough - he has completely transformed my face and I love my new eyebrows and new eyelashes.' The acid used to attack Kanwal can be bought for as little as 15p a bottle in the streets near her home, with no questions asked. Father-of-two Dr Shahmalak, who lives with his GP wife Rubina in Cheadle, Manchester, said: 'Kanwal is one of the bravest women I have ever met. Surgeons have spent the past decade painstakingly rebuilding her features One of the team helping her has been hair transplant surgeon Asim Shahmalak, who is based Manchester, where he has treated a number of celebrity clients 'The surgeons have done a remarkable job completely rebuilding her features and I was delighted to be able to help with her eyebrows and new eyelashes. 'It was wonderful to hear how she has turned her life around, found happiness and got married. 'She is now having her nose remodelled and making amazing progress every time I meet her. It has been so rewarding to be part of her recovery.' Kanwal, pictured before the attack, was attacked by a friend who did not want her to become an air hostess Dr Shahmalak met Kanwal again while on a new mercy mission to Pakistan last week. He has identified seven new people he will help with free hair, eyebrow and eyelash transplants later this year. He is taking a team from Crown Clinic to carry out the surgical reconstruction. He spent Â£50,000 of his own money helping Kanwal and five other women on a previous trip two years ago - one of whom was attacked with acid after turning down a man's marriage proposal. Dr Shahmalak, a skilled former NHS surgeon, works with celebrities including Gogglebox's Chris Steed, football pundit Didi Hamann and Homes Under The Hammer star Martin Roberts, who have all recently had procedures at Crown Clinic, one of the world's leading hair transplant centres. He said: 'I wept when I heard these women's stories. Being doused with acid because you refused a man's marriage proposal - people were treated better in the Middle Ages. 'Helping to rebuild their faces is some of the most rewarding work that I do. Just seeing their smiles after the surgery makes it all worthwhile.' Dr Shahmalak, who was born in Karachi but moved to the UK after qualifying as a doctor, was introduced to the patients by the Pakistan-based charity Depilex Smileagain Foundation whose founder Masarrat Misbah has worked tirelessly to help victims of acid attacks.
