If we were able to see the chakras as many( psychics , in fact, do) we would observe a wheel of energy continuously revolving or rotating. Clairvoyants perceive chakras as colorful wheels or flowers with a hub in the center. The chakras begin at the base of the spine and finish at the top of the head. Though fixed in the central spinal column they are located on both the front and back of the body, and work through it. \nEach chakra vibrates or rotates at a different speed. The root or first chakra rotates at the slowest speed, the crown or seventh chakra at the highest speed. Each chakra is stimulated by its own and complimentary color, and a range of gemstones for specific uses. The chakra colors are of the rainbow; red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The size and brightness of the wheels vary with individual development, physical condition, energy levels, disease, or stress. \nIf the chakras are not balanced, or if the energies are blocked, the basic life force will be slowed down. The individual may feel listless, tired, out of sorts, or depressed. Not only will physical bodily functions be affected so diseases may manifest, but the thought processes and the mind may also be affected. A negative attitude, fear, doubt, etc. may preoccupy the individual. \nA constant balance between the chakras promotes health and a sense of well being. If the chakras are opened to much, a person could literally short circuit themselves with too much universal energy going through the body. If the chakras are closed, this does not allow for the universal energy to flow through them properly which may also lead to dis-ease. \nMost of us react to unpleasant experiences by blocking our feeling and stopping a great deal of our natural energy flow. This affects the maturation and development of the chakras. Whenever a person blocks whatever experience he is having, he in turn blocks his chakras, which eventually become disfigured. When the chakras are functioning normally, each will be open, spinning clockwise to metabolize the particular energies needed from the universal energy field. \nAs already mentioned any imbalances that exist within any chakra may have profound effects upon either our physical or emotional bodies. We are able to use quartz crystals and gemstones to re-balance all our chakric centers and once the chakra has been properly balanced then our body will gradually return to normal. \nThe reason why crystals and gemstones are wonderful and powerful healing tools are because of what science calls its piezoelectric effect. (You can see this effect in the modern quartz watches). Crystals and gemstones respond to the electricity that is coursing through our body, and if the energy is sluggish, the constant electrical vibrations of the stones will help to harmonize, balance, and stimulate these energies. THE SEVEN MAJOR CHAKRAS First Chakra - Root \nStudying the individual chakras begins with the root chakra , called Muladhara in Sanskrit. The root chakra is located at the base of the spine at the tailbone in back, and the pubic bone in front. This center holds the basic needs for survival, security and safety. The root chakra is powerfully related to our contact with the Earth Mother , providing us with the ability to be grounded into the earth plane. This is also the center of manifestation. When you are trying to make things happen in the material world, business or material possessions, the energy to succeed will come from the first chakra. If this chakra is blocked an individual may feel fearful, anxious, insecure and frustrated. Problems like obesity, anorexia nervosa, and knee troubles can occur. Root body parts include the hips, legs, lower back and sexual organs. The colors used for this chakra are red, brown and black. The gemstones are Garnet, Smoky Quartz, Obsidian, and Black Tourmaline. NOTE: A man¹s sexual organs are located primarily in his f irst chakra , so male sexual energy is usually experienced primarily as physical. A women's sexual organs are located primarily in her second chakra, so female sexual energy is usually experienced primarily as emotional. Both chakras are associated with sexual energy. Second Chakra - Belly (Sacral) \nThe second chakra is often referred to as the belly or sacral chakra . It is located two inches below the navel and is rooted into the spine. This center holds the basic needs for sexuality, creativity, intuition, and self-worth. This chakra is also about friendliness, creativity, and emotions. It governs peoples sense of self-worth, their confidence in their own creativity, and their ability to relate to others in an open and friendly way. It¹s influenced by how emotions were expressed or repressed in the family during childhood. Proper balance in this chakra means the ability to flow with emotions freely and to feel and reach out to others sexually or not. If this chakra is blocked a person may feel emotionally explosive, manipulative, obsessed with thoughts of sex or may lack energy. Physical problems may include, kidney weakness, stiff lower back, constipation, and muscle spasms. Belly body parts include sexual organs (women), kidneys, bladder, and large intestine. The main color used with this chakra is orange. The gemstones are Carnelian Agate, Orange Calcite and Tigers Eye.

When the Third Chakra is out of balance you may lack confidence, be confused, worry about what others think, feel that others are controlling your life, and may be depressed.

Almost everyone today has a hard, hurt, or broken heart , and it is no accident that heart disease is the number one killer in America today. Deep heart hurts can result in aura obstructions called heart scars. When these scars are released, they raise a lot of old pain, but free the heart for healing and new growth.

They respected the wholeness of the body, emotions, mind, and spirit, saw the goddess (god) within all Being, and treated their patients with respect and caring. Healing was a three way agreement between healer, goddess (god) and the person being healed, and healing was an active choice. Such partnerships and participation are missing in today¹s modern medicine, along with the concepts of wholeness and respect. Anyone can heal, and anyone can choose well-being. By learning and using the ancient skills of healing, many diseases of the body, emotions, mind, and spirit are preventable, or are easily transformed before they become matters for the allopathic medicine. The skills of the ancient healers are available, powerful and very much alive right now. Please use these tools, it is our right!! \nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n~Brennen, Barbara Ann, Hands of Light: A Guide to Healing through the Human Energy Field.
