The park has released two new videos with footage highlighting the world of Pandora attractions. \nThe videos tease the Na'vi River Journey, \"where you can navigate a mystical river,\" and Avatar Flight of Passage, \"where you can fly on a banshee.\" \nCameron offered a look at the upcoming attractions in December, saying in a video, \"I don't know if I can express how it feels to see something that I imagined in 1995 suddenly made physically real. They are using the absolute cutting-edge technology. Stuff that has never been applied before.\"\nWatch the videos below. \nRelated: James Cameron Shows Off Disney's 'Avatar' Attraction in Behind-the-Scenes Video", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:18:32.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
