Teenager died after branch snapped and he hit head on submerged rock \nHe refused to give them any cash so they punched and kicked him before stabbing him six times while he curled up in a bid to protect himself. \nNewbold received a slash to the arm and multiple stab wounds to his abdomen in the attack last August, which has been described as ‘lifechanging’. \nAfter the attack he staggered to a nearby takeaway, bleeding profusely, where he drifted in and out of consciousness before an ambulance came to take him to hospital. Sean Kelly, 23, was jailed for 14 months (Picture: North News) \nThere he was found to have three stab wounds in his stomach. While he was fighting for life, the attackers, who had taken his rucksack and belongings, passed on his bank card to Sean Kelly, 23, who tried to use it at McDonald’s. \nMr Newbold said in a victim statement: ‘There has never been a time before this attack when I felt my life was in danger. Girl fighting for life after school hall ceiling collapses on her \n‘It terrified me that I had no time to react and get away. I felt trapped. I think it is disgraceful myself and other members of the public do not feel safe to walk through our own home city.’ \nMr Newbold said the pain he suffered was ‘excruciating’, he has permanent scarring and it was unclear what impact the injuries would have on his employment as a groundworker. \nJones was jailed for 12 years and six months while Kelly was jailed for 14 months. \nRecorder Darren Preston told Newcastle Crown Court: ‘He was lucky to have escaped without even more permanent damage than he has, or even death. \n‘This was a city centre, where people should feel safe to go about their business.’ \nNick Cartmell, defending Jones, told the court; ‘It was a hot summer’s night, a good night for begging. These were homeless people, he and his girlfriend were at the cashpoint, there was an argument. \n‘It was a joint attack. He was not the initial stabber. He was not responsible for all the injuries that were inflicted. He is now sober and no longer on drugs. \n‘He reflects back on this as a night of horror and is truly sorry for the life-changing injuries inflicted on Mr Newbold.’ \nDefence for Kelly, who was not involved in the stabbing, said he had stopped taking legal highs and re-established a family relationship. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:33:34.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
