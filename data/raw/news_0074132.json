The 52-year-old, who lives in Plano, Texas, works at a Braum's -- an ice cream shop and burger restaurant -- in McKinney, Texas. Though he usually gets a ride back home from work, he has to walk over a bridge and through several highways to get there. \nThough the two-and-a half-hour commute might dishearten many, Edmond said he actually loves and appreciates the long walk. He keeps a positive spirit. \n\"Some people drive, some people ride bicycles -- and I happen to walk,\" he told ABC affiliate WFAA in Dallas. \"I would love to have a car, but the car don’t make the person.\" \n\n84-year-old man walks 700 miles to raise money for park honoring late wife \n\nMeet the 100-Year-Old Woman Who Works 11 Hours a Day, 6 Days a Week \n\nTiny therapy dog embarks on 375-mile hike across California to raise awareness for hospice care \nEdmond said that, during his commute, he likes to reflect and think about the people he has encountered and the experiences he has gone through. \nThis past Saturday, Feb. 18, a police officer met Edmonds and was touched by his story. \nThe officer encountered Edmond walking along a highway in McKinney after a caller reported seeing him and expressed concern for his safety, according to Sgt. Ana Shelley, the public information officer for the McKinney Police Department. \n\"The officer found him, asked if he was OK and offered him a ride,\" Shelley told ABC News. \"Through the course of the ride, they chit-chatted a bit, and the officer was impressed with his work ethic and positive attitude despite having to walk two-and-a-half hours to work almost every day.\" \n\nMcKinney Police Department/Facebook \nOfficer Branson of the McKinney Police Department in Texas caught up with Patrick Edmond, who walks about a dozen miles to work five days a week, on Feb. 18, 2017. \nThe McKinney Police Department posted about the inspirational encounter on Facebook , saying that the officer believed \"everyone should know about Patrick [Edmond].\" \nThe Facebook post has received more than 6,200 \"reactions,\" and has been shared more than 1,100 times as of this afternoon. \nLoEster Posey, Edmond’s aunt, told WFAA that she was shocked when she saw the post on her social media feed because she hadn't seen Edmond in years. \nPosey said that Edmond had closed himself off a few years ago after going through \"a lot of hard blows in life.\" \n\"He took nobody's phone calls,\" Posey said. \nEdmond's parents died just a few years apart, she said, and his best friend died of a drug overdose. For a while, she said, Edmond also struggled with addiction. \nOn Tuesday, Posey found Edmond along his walk and offered him a ride. \nAfter years apart, the two shared an emotional reunion in Posey's car. \n\"I’m so proud of you, Patrick,\" Posey told Edmond with tears in her eyes. \nEdmond told WFAA he usually does not accept many rides, but this one with his aunt was much needed. \n\"It’s wild, it’s humbling,\" he said. \n\nWFAA \nPatrick Edmond of Plano, Texas, walks about a dozen miles to work at an ice cream shop and restaurant in McKinney, Texas, five days a week. \nThe 52-year-old was reminded that he has family just around the corner and that he's not alone, WFAA reported. \nBraum's, the restaurant chain where Edmond works, told ABC News in a statement that Edmond \"is a hard-working and dedicated employee\" who has been with the company for almost a year. \n\"He always has a smile on his face and a jump in his step,\" Braum's said. \"We cannot say enough about Patrick. His commitment to his work is remarkable and we commend him. We look forward to what the future has in store for him.\" \nThe company said it was only made aware of Edmond's commute to work, on foot, this weekend, after his story aired on a local news station. \n\"Once we learned about his situation, we began looking into the matter with our management team in the area,\" Braum's said. The company learned Edmond previously worked at a store in Plano, Texas, where he lives, but after he was offered a promotion to work at the store in McKinney, he transferred. \n\"During his interview for the new position, he was asked if he had reliable transportation and he informed the district manager that he did,\" Braum's said. \"We take the health, safety and well-being of our employees seriously. So, [Edmond] was offered a chance to transfer back to a store in Plano with his promotion intact.\" \nHowever, Edmond \"is so excited about his new position that he has elected to continue working in McKinney,\" the company said. \n\"You just got to get up and keep going, keep walking,\" Edmond told WFAA.\n  \" \nThis 52-year-old man walks 12 miles to work 5 days a week         \" \nUtah teens accused of plot to rob, kill girl found shot in canal \" \nEmails: EPA's Pruitt cozy with fossil fuel industry \" \nGOP town hall backlash is 'hybrid' of real concern, 'manufactured' anger, WH says \" \nRussia military acknowledges new branch: info warfare troops \" \nFed officials discussed possible rate hike 'fairly soon' Lawyer says she failed prep school grad at sex assault trial \" \nMuslim activists raise over $70,000 to aid vandalized Jewish cemetery Amazon resists request for Echo info in Arkansas slaying \" \nJustices side with Michigan girl in dispute over service dog \" \nSpaceX aborts approach to space station, delivery delayed 2 men face sentencing for Kansas hate crime attack Death in Mississippi: Man held in quadruple slaying Ohio court will hear debate on autopsies of 8 family members \" \n'Shark Tank's' most frustrating yet successful entrepreneur on who was the bigger fish \" \nCalifornia's wet weather has some believing drought is over \" \nBindi Irwin posts tribute to late father Steve on his birthday \" \nDylann Roof stopped at 2nd AME church after shooting \" \n'It saved my life': Talk of Obamacare repeal worries addicts \" \nOscars red carpet: Stylists to Viola Davis, Natalie Portman, Michelle Williams share secrets \" \n'Moonlight': How the little film that could made it to the Oscars \" \nEverything we know so far about the untitled Han Solo film", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:51:02.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
