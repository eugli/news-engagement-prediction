Here is what you need to know about the Federal Government's proposed changes to child care payments. \n\"This is once-in-a-generation reform to child care that Australian families are absolutely screaming out for,\" Mr Porter said, who argued an additional 1 million children who attend after-school care could also benefit. \nAs part of the omnibus bill, those receiving Family Tax Benefit payments will receive an extra $20 a week, but will relinquish annual supplements, starting from July next year. \nThe Government has offered $4 billion in sweeteners over the next four years, in exchange for $8 billion worth of welfare savings or cuts. \nThe Federal Opposition confirmed it would vote against the omnibus bill. \nIt argues families on FTB-A would be $200 a year per child worse off, while those on FTB-B would be $350 a year worse off as a family.
