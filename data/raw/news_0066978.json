By Daniel Marans Joshua Roberts / Reuters South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Jaime Harrison speaks during a Democratic National Committee forum in Baltimore on Feb. 11, 2017. \nSouth Carolina Democratic Party Chair Jaime Harrison is withdrawing from the race to chair the Democratic National Committee and throwing his support behind former Labor Secretary Tom Perez. \n“Despite strong performances at the debate and DNC regional forums, the votes are simply not there for me to secure victory on Saturday,” Harrison said in a Thursday statement announcing his decision. “We have a candidate for DNC Chair who can unite the Democratic Party behind the goal of enacting progressive change, a candidate who can take the fight to Donald Trump and rebuild our Party infrastructure, and a candidate whom I, as a voting member of the DNC, am proud to support: Tom Perez.” \nHarrison’s endorsement is a significant pick-up for Perez heading into Saturday’s vote in Atlanta. Perez is locked in a tight race with Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.). \nDo you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post? Here’s how.
