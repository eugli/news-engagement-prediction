Photo: Ffloyd Laurie talks to 7.30 about his mesothelioma and James Hardie's asbestos mine. \nMr Laurie, 55, was farewelled today by about 700 people at St Mary's Catholic Church in the northern New South Wales town of Casino. \nHe died on January 24 from mesothelioma after growing up in the Indigenous community of Baryulgil where his father worked at a nearby asbestos mine. \nMr Laurie was diagnosed with the asbestos-related disease in July last year. \nHe attended Baryulgil Public School and was one of many children who played among mounds of asbestos tailings, from the James Hardie mine, in the 1970s. Video: Baryulgil asbestos (ABC News) 'Just not fair' \nOne of Mr Laurie's colleagues Hannah Visser, from the Aboriginal Medical Service in Grafton, spoke at the funeral of the unfair nature of his illness. \n\"At work, Ffloyd was the connector between black and white and coloured beyond all existing and imaginary boundaries,\" Dr Visser said. \n\"Then he was diagnosed with mesothelioma almost 50 years after growing up in Baryulgil and, like many others, he was just an innocent child exposed to asbestos. \n\"Ffloyd was too unwell to reach his 10 years as an Aboriginal health worker at the AMS (Aboriginal Medical Service) â€¦ and he said to me many times 'Don't you cry'. \n\"We spoke about his faith, about his fears, about his friendships and about his family and we cried together because it was just not fair.\" Photo: Speakers at the funeral recalled Mr Laurie's \"infectious laugh\", faith, friendship, and love for his family. (ABC North Coast: Elloise Farrow-Smith) \nMr Laurie's niece Moeisha Davis spoke of his popularity in the community. \n\"He had an infectious laugh and people would smile around him and simply enjoy his company,\" Ms Davis said. \n\"Ffloyd would talk to people and Noelene [his wife] would say 'Ffloyd, who are they and where do they come from?' \n\"He would reply, 'I'm well-known all over' and this was so true because whatever place we visited, Ffloyd would always know someone from that place.\" \nMr Laurie's niece Mia Randall said his family had gathered together to savour his last moments. \n\"He cherished every day and moment he had left with his family, knowing that he didn't have long with us,\" she said. \n\"On the day of his passing he called Aunty Noelene in the room and told her he was ready to go home.\" Precedent set \nThe week before Mr Laurie died, the New South Wales Education Department settled an action launched by his lawyer Tanya Segelov. \nShe told ABC North Coast that Mr Laurie had been satisfied with the settlement. \n\"He knew the importance for anyone else who may come down the track, of establishing this precedent,\" Ms Segelov said. \n\"This is a disease that has a long latency period, an average of 40 years between exposure and diagnosis. \n\"So Ffloyd was the first of that generation, and what we have is a lot of very nervous people who think, 'This could be me too'.\" \nMr Laurie is survived by his mother, Lillian, wife Noelene, four children and five grandchildren.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:11:12.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
