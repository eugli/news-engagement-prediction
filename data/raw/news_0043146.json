They protest! They don’t want to date anyone who supported Trump! HOW RUDE! “Liberals may feel energized by a surge in political activism, and a unified stance against a president they see as irresponsible and even dangerous,” Tavernise wrote. “But that momentum is provoking an equal and opposite reaction on the right.”\n “I didn’t choose a side. They put me on one,” one Trump voter told her. “They are scarier to me than these Islamic terrorists,” another said of the protesters, expressing her concern that they are destroying democracy. “I feel absolutely disgusted with them and their antics. It strengthens people’s resolve in wanting to support President Trump. It really does.” OK, first of all, you did choose a side. That’s what voting is – choosing one candidate over another. And second, protesters are not destroying democracy – they are participating in it.\nTavernise writes that one man “stayed in the closet” about his Trump support because he lives in the liberal haven of the San Francisco Bay Area. Yes, it is a very poor choice of phrase, considering that SF has long been a sanctuary for those facing real danger because of their sexuality, and that’s vastly different from some dude worried a woman will swipe left on him if he’s wearing a tacky-ass Make America Great Again cap in his profile pic. But beyond that, I can tell you who’s demonstrably meaner than a bunch of liberals posting on Facebook or carrying protest signs: President Donald Trump. His executive orders, his policies, and his top-level team members define cruelty. He enacted a poorly written and unconstitutional travel ban on a Friday evening that kept elderly people stuck in the airport for hours and separated a 5-year-old child from his mother. He elevated a white supremacist to White House chief strategist. His pick to head the Department of Education helped fund a group that thinks child labor should be a thing . He and his team *routinely* make up fake massacres and terror attacks , while ignoring real devastation . He banned federal funding to organizations that so much as mention abortion to the people they serve , without concern that women will undoubtedly die as a result. (This isn’t even getting into all the personal insults he’s lobbed – you do remember we’re talking about the man who called a woman “Miss Piggy,” right?)\nAnd yet somewhere the Trump supporters think the real problem is that sometimes protests — one of the places where we are literally fighting for people's lives — can get a little rowdy? And that maybe we don’t want to date someone who is accepting or supportive of policies that are totally antithetical to our values? Cry me a fucking river. “They were making me want to support him more with how irrational they were being,” the SF Trump supporter said. OK, let’s look at this rationally : What you are saying is that because you don’t like the way I express my political views, you are more inclined to support a man who is a threat to people around the world as well as our nation’s stability, a man who is blatantly sexist, racist, and xenophobic. Nope, not buying it. Liberals didn't make these people run toward Trump because we're too political on Facebook, and I'm tired of being used to justify their support of blatant bigotry.\n A few weeks ago, I published an article titled “Grow the F*ck Up, Mr. President,” comparing to the leader of the free world to a toddler because of his juvenile, self-involved behavior. Unsurprisingly, I got a lot of emails in response. Some were supportive, but many of them boiled down to, “YOUR FOUL LANGUAGE IS THE REASON PEOPLE VOTE FOR TRUMP!” Sorry, but I’m pretty sure that’s not the case. These people voted for Trump for many reasons — they vote the party line no matter what, they wanted a conservative pick for the Supreme Court, they want tax breaks and ridiculous amounts of racism/sexism/homophobia didn’t seem a deal breaker, maybe they’re even sexist or racist themselves — but the liberals calling Trump names and my use of profanity isn't one of them. The things Trump supporters now claim to abhor so much — the meanness, the foul language — are the singular area where Trump excels (outside of self-promotion). As Ana Navarro so famously/gloriously said on CNN : \"Don't tell me you're offended when I say ‘pussy,’ but you're not offended when Donald Trump says it. I'm not running for president, he is.”\n And besides, there are plenty of \"well-behaved\" people speaking up about Trump — only to encounter the same response. Meryl Streep, who has given a couple of speeches about the president's bullying ways , seems like a one such person who might be able to reach across the political aisle and gently put some common sense into these people. “This instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing,” she said in her Golden Globes speech . “Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose.” She didn’t utter a single “fuck,” didn’t call Trump supporters names. She simply said what should have been indisputable – respect is good, bullying is bad. Still, her speech was immediately held up as an example of why Trump won. One of the women in the Times article explicitly stated that she can't even enjoy Meryl Streep movies anymore. Can you imagine?! A speech by an actress can cause this woman pure devastation, but the fact that Trump kept children from getting life-sustaining medical care is whatever for her? Nah, girl.\nI don’t want to make nice with those people, because they don’t want to make nice with me, or the people I care about. Don’t dangle the carrot of “maybe if you say the exact right thing about Trump in a not mean way, then I’ll reconsider my already cast vote” in front of my face because it’s a lie. If these Trump voters were so inclined, they could easily find people writing calmly about the dangers of Trump all over the internet, or speaking about it on television, and they have chosen not to.\nMake no mistake: we liberals — or as I prefer to call us, “reasonable humans with a modicum of empathy” — are outraged. We can't afford not to be. Of course our written and verbalized feelings sometimes take a harsh tone, but it comes from a place of compassion, frustration, and a whole mixture of emotions that add up to “scared shitless for this country.” We don’t want to see America move backward — running away from life-saving health care and toward building a useless, impossible, racist border wall .\nTrump has all the power, and the written and spoken word, along with organization and protest, are some of the limited ways we can mount a resistance. Maybe sometimes liberals use language that isn’t the most genteel or call out Trump supporters on their Facebook wall (the horror!), but battling for your rights and the rights of others isn’t usually done over a proper afternoon tea. I don’t want to get a couples massage and hash out my feelings with some dude who blames the problems in this country not on the people creating and perpetuating them, but instead on the people who are simply pointing them out -- or worse, doesn’t see what Trump is doing as problematic at all.\n Many of us have come out swinging because we believe an inclusive America is worth fighting for. And we’re not just fighting for ourselves — we’re fighting for all of us , on both sides of the political aisle. We fight for everyone who isn’t a rich straight white man with a particular set of backward ideals. We fight for the soul of this country, because the progress made by brave activists in the past cannot be erased. We fight because we know we have so much further to go as a country and we believe that's worth taking to the streets for. We fight because we all have things to lose, including health care, marriage rights, and this entire country to war when Trump tweets the wrong thing at 5 a.m.\nSo, no. I am not concerned with being called mean by Trump supporters, and I’m not bothered by making them uncomfortable. It's not my job to make them feel okay with their decision to support a man who can and likely will inflict a lot of harm on a lot of people. And it's certainly not the job of people who are marginalized and endangered to erase their identities or control their outrage at their own oppression.\nIf it causes you discomfort to hear liberals speaking up about hate, racism, sexism, homophobia, greed, and abject cruelty, maybe you should reexamine just exactly what the fuck you stand for.\nFollow Laura on Twitter .\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/02/01/tale-of-an-iraqi-woman-dying-because-of-trump-travel-ban-unravels/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/betsy-devos-child-labor-acton_us_5836eb7fe4b000af95edf12e", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/05/politics/trump-health-care-tax-cuts/", "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/trump-the-bully-214698", "http://twitter.com/mrpenguino", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/claudiakoerner/trumps-travel-ban-is-keeping-sick-kids-from-medical-care-so", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/opinion/sunday/are-liberals-helping-trump.html?_r=1", "http://mediamatters.org/video/2016/10/08/trump-apologist-told-ana-navarro-not-say-pussy-cnn-it-didnt-go-well-her/213644", "http://www.salon.com/2017/01/31/classmates-say-suspected-quebec-mosque-shooter-loved-trump_partner/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/us/politics/wall-border-trump.html"], "published": "2017-02-20T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:49:12.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
