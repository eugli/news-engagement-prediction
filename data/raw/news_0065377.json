We also call upon any witness who can assist us in the investigation to come forward,” he told a press conference yesterday. \nKoh was abducted last Monday by a group of masked men at Jalan SS4B/10, Petaling Jaya, less than 100m from the police housing complex. \nHe was driving a silver car bearing licence plate ST 5515 D. \nHis family has raised the reward amount for information on his whereabouts to RM100,000 from RM10,000. So far, the family has not received no new lead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:25:29.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
