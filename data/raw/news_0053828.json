By Peggy Truong Disney Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Disney’s live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast , starring Emma Watson and Dan Stevens, arrives in theaters next month. Surely, viewers will come out of the theater experience singing their favorite tunes (“Something There” for me) with an appetite for cake or whatever soup they end up slurping (sans spoon) at dinner. The 1991 animated film left the world with plenty of questions; here's hoping some of these questions will be addressed this time around. 1. Will live-action Gaston actually eat raw eggs? Animated Gaston pops five dozen of them on screen, NBD, but will Luke Evans pull it off? Related: Will he then get salmonella or a bad stomach ache, which will delay his Kill the Beast mission by a few days? 2. Will Belle get to eat an actual meal after sampling things during “Be Our Guest?” Or will her meal intake during the big musical number only be limited to things like “grey stuff?” Disney 3. Will Belle and Beast have an epic snowball fight? In the animated film, this is a key scene for their relationship, as they grow from captor and prisoner to friends and eventually, ~*more than friends*~. This isn't a real problem, but here's hoping both Emma and Dan are good at throwing ice. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 4. Speaking of captor-prisoner, will Emma Watson and Dan Stevens succeed in making everyone forget about the whole Stockholm Syndrome thing? Emma already says 2017’s Belle and Beast’s relationship is nothing like a captor-prisoner situation , mostly thanks to Belle’s ability to stick up for herself and call her own shots. But it’s just so hard to forget about. 5. Where are Beast’s parents? Unlike the animated film, the live-action movie (or trailer, anyway) shows a young prince with two adults in some rich person painting. Are they just on a cruise somewhere with Pitbull, set to return in a few/10 years? BB prince and his parents as seen in an oil painting. Disney 6. What is Beast’s name? This has long been up for debate in the Disney community and, depending on who you talk to, Adam is apparently the Beast’s name when he’s in human form. Oh Disney, please let live-action Beast’s name be Ron (or even Harry). That would be just the best. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 7. How old is Beast? If the live-action stays true to the animated original, Belle meets Beast as he inches closer to his 21st birthday, which also happens to be the last year the spell can be broken. (If the spell isn't broken by the time he's of legal drinking age in the U.S., the Beast will remain beastly forever). Emma can still pass for a teenager but I’m sorry, Matthew Crawley does not look 21 or younger. 8. What’s the deal with Chip? Will Emma Thompson’s soothing voice finally explain how Chip came to be? Where was he born? Who is his father? Has he been in cup form his entire life so far? Will being a child once the spell is broken be a bit shocking for him? And most importantly: will his brothers and sisters be in the live action movie? Disney 9. What happens if you touch the rose? This is a mystery I’ve been obsessed with since 1991, along with these related questions: Who cleans the pretty glass that covers the enchanted rose? What happens to the rose petals that have fallen? Can you at least sniff it, or does that make the spell worse? 10. Will LeFou be more than a doormat to Gaston? Josh Gad is a great actor. Please let him have some decent one-liners.

This is just a personal wish because Cate is the queen of everything. Beauty and the Beast opens March 17. Follow Peggy on Twitter .
