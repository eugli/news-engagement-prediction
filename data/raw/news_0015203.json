The higher court’s denial of an immediate stay means legal battles over the ban will continue into the coming week at least. \nActing Solicitor-General Noel Francisco forcefully argued in the government’s brief on Saturday night that presidential authority is “largely immune from judicial control” when it comes to deciding who can enter or stay in the United States.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T12:25:14.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
