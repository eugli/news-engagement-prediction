Fox Globe Correspondents February 19, 2017\nPEABODY — State and local police were investigating the deaths of a man and a woman found inside a Peabody home, in a crime scene so “messy” that it was initially difficult to determine how many bodies were in the house, said an Essex District Attorney spokeswoman on Sunday.\nThe spokeswoman, Carrie Kimball Monahan, said investigators at first struggled to determine the number of victims in the house at 19 Farm Ave. , “because of the condition of the scene,” which she did not describe further.\nAdvertisement\nPolice requested X-ray equipment from the state fire marshal’s office to help determine an accurate body count, Monahan said.\nMonahan said later Sunday that investigators have identified the victims but their names were not being released pending family notification. She did not say how they had died and said that no arrests have been made.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email.

Sign up for more newsletters here State Police learned about the deaths at about 11:30 p.m. Saturday when a woman who had been inside the home arrived at their barracks in Danvers, Monahan said.\nThe woman had fled the home and flagged down a vehicle that brought her to the barracks. Troopers then went to the home, according to Monahan, and called for a K-9 unit, she said.\nPat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\nA body was wheeled to the medical examiner's vehicle in Peabody on Sunday.\n“It [was] a painstaking process to sift through exactly what we’re looking for, while preserving evidence of the crime,” she said Sunday.\nAdvertisement\nBased on a statement the woman made to police at the barracks, she said, it appears that the people involved in the crime knew one another.\nEssex District Attorney Jonathan W. Blodgett does not believe the public is at risk, she said.\nDavid Procopio, a Massachusetts State Police spokesman, declined to answer questions about the deaths, citing the ongoing investigation.\n“The scene is being processed for evidence by our crime scene technicians, and homicide detectives are developing and following relevant information,” Procopio said in an e-mail. “In order to protect the integrity of the ongoing investigation, we can’t discuss specific details at this juncture.”\nRose, a neighbor who asked that her last name be withheld because she was concerned for her safety, said police had visited 19 Farm Ave. repeatedly in the past, and the house was a cause for concern among neighbors.\n“I’m just quite shocked because I was on my way to church services this morning and I noticed all the police commotion. ... My neighborhood has been turned into a police scene all afternoon,” Rose said by phone Sunday evening.\nOf the residents at the house, she said, “They weren’t ideal neighbors. ... I kept away from them as much as possible.” Prior to their arrival, she said, it had always been “a peaceful neighborhood and a lovely one.”\nA small group of spectators watched from behind yellow crime scene tape Sunday afternoon as officials loaded what appeared to be two black body bags into the back of a truck belonging to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.\nThe news that bodies were found inside the home was shocking, said 20-year-old Julia Brown, who lives down the down the street.\n“It’s just scary,” said 19-year-old Nicole Hart, a friend of Brown’s who also lives on Farm Avenue. “You always think it’s going to happen somewhere else.”\nThe small, white two-bedroom bungalow, built in 1920, is located near Interstate 95 in a mostly industrial neighborhood with a handful of residences along the street. A wheelchair ramp is connected to the front door, and a “Beware of dog” sign hangs next to a side door.\nAn online property search shows the owners of the nearly 3-acre property listed as Stanley J. Pikul Jr. and Lucy J. Pikul, who live in the house next door. The Pikuls could not be reached for comment Sunday.\n“This stuff just doesn’t happen in Peabody,” said Don Tapley, another neighbor.\nKeith Bedford/Globe Staff\nA police officer put up crime scene tape on Sunday.\nPat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\nThe crime scene was so “messy” that it was initially difficult to determine how many bodies were in the house, said an Essex District Attorney spokeswoman on Sunday.\nPat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\nA soiled bag was carried to a larger evidence bag.\nPat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\nInvestigators handled evidence bags at the scene.\nKeith Bedford/Globe Staff\nAn investigator carried a bag of evidence.\nGlobe correspondent Lauren Fox contributed to this report.
