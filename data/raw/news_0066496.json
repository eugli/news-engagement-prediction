Add onion and cook on medium-low for 5 minutes, until they turn translucent. Add remaining ingredients and let the sauce simmer for 6-7 minutes, or until brown sugar has melted and sauce is well combined. Add a tablespoon (15/mL) or two of water if a sauce is too thick. Remove from heat until burger patties have finished cooking. You will need to rewarm before serving. \nPreheat grill. Combine ground meat with egg, minced onion, panko, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce. Form into 5-6 equal sized patties. Season with salt and black pepper. Place patties onto grill and cook for 5-7 minutes per side or until internal temperature of patties reach 165 degrees. You will want these burgers as well done as possible given the extra ingredients, so no medium or medium rare for these burgers. The last few minutes of cooking, place a slice of Havarti cheese on each patty and cook until cheese has melted. Remove from heat. \nTo assemble, scoop warmed sauce onto bottom half of bun, top with cooked meatloaf patty and top with sliced tomatoes and lettuce.
