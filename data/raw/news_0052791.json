Pin \nIn her hospital room, Jill and Colin spar verbally about the fate of their marriage. Colin wants to start over with a clean slate, but Jill insists they are through. Colin thinks the incident was a blessing in disguise. Jill scoffs; she should be thanking him for stealing all her money. Colin vows to put it back; he can’t live without her. Jill complains that Katherine saw Colin for what he is. Colin argues that Kay was jealous; and their relationship was toxic. Jill’s machine beeps and she struggles to breathe as Colin slanders Katherine. A nurse kicks Colin out. After, she warns him not to upset her again. Colin tells Jill she scared him to death, and tells her she needs him - Esther’s useless and Billy will run back to Victoria every time she has a hangnail. Jill maintains ‘good Colin’ was just a fictional character she created and asks him to leave. Later, Colin lurks outside her room. \nMore: Y&R alum to appear on The View \nOn the Crimson Lights patio, Billy grouses about Colin to Victoria. Nick arrives and joins them. The conversation goes from Jill to GC Buzz to Reed being talented. Nick enthuses, “You should have heard him at open mic night. He absolutely killed it.” Stunned, Vikki asks, “Reed did what?” Nick learns that Reed was still grounded, but still vouches for his talent. Victoria muses if Reed thought he was in prison before, he’ll now be in solitary confinement. Billy and Nick feel she should be encouraging Reed to pursue a creative outlet. They counsel Vikki to work to improve her relationship with Reed. Later, Chelsea arrives to meet Nick, who missed her. He talks about Vikki’s issues with Reed and talk turns to their boys. \nRelated: OLTL alum Nathan Fillion to guest star on Brooklyn Nine-Nine \nAt The Underground, Noah and Mariah discuss her successful interview with Vikki before talk turns to Reed.

He’s dismayed; now his mother will find out he was singing in a bar when he was grounded. Noah assures the teen he’ll have his back. A fan approaches Reed and Mariah enthuses that he has his first groupie. Reed just wants to play his music, but grins at the girls looking at him. \nSharon apologizes to Nikki for pouring milk over her at the ranch. Nikki confirms there is a way she can make it up to her. She asks Sharon to help her start a shelter for women who are truly in dire straits as a way of honoring Dylan. Nikki feels Sharon can relate to the broken, insecure women and help them rebuild their lives. Sharon doesn’t even know how to rebuild her own. Nikki notes Sharon’s been strong for her kids, and now she has to be strong to honor Dylan’s sacrifice. \nNew: Chesapeake Shores on Hallmark Channel renewed for season two \nReed arrives at home to find Billy with Victoria, who is upset he snuck out and performed at open mic night. Reed argues his case – her rules make it impossible to pursue his music. When he mentions the video Mariah posted, Victoria realizes he’s been back to The Underground. Reed complains that Noah and Mariah have done more to support him than she has since he moved back. He reveals that his video has thousands of hits and Billy’s excited. Reed wonders if Vikki will let him play next week. Billy mediates as they hash it out. Reed pleads with his mother to let him try. He tries to show her the video, but she doesn’t want to see it. Reed storms upstairs. Billy whips out the clip. “He wasn’t lying, the crowd loves him.” \nSharon spots Nick and Chelsea at the coffee house and reveals that Nikki snapped her out of her slump. She tells Chelsea she won’t be at tomorrow’s meeting. “I’m quitting.” Sharon will be running Crimson Lights. She recalls when Noah was born prematurely – they got through that and it inspires her to believe she can get through anything. Chelsea applauds Sharon’s new outlook and shares some insight on moving on. \nMore: Y&R alum Adam Lazarre-White (Nathan) joins other soap actors in The Choir Director \nAt The Underground, Nikki tells Noah and Mariah about her truce with Sharon – they realized they’re on the same side. Noah is glad since Dylan really did a number on his mom. Nikki insists it was difficult for Dylan to leave. “He didn’t want to do it, he had no choice!” Noah becomes suspicious. Nikki tells him he’s a good son and rushes off. Mariah approaches Noah, who says he’s okay, but he isn’t sure Nikki and his mother are. \nNext on The Young and the Restless: \nNoah says to Sharon, “Grandma said Dylan didn’t have a choice. What did she mean by that?” \nGloria tells Michael, “It hurts deeply that you’re shutting me out.” Michael replies, “I am equally chagrined that you continue to insist that your job here is legitimate.” \nJill says to Jack, “You made a solid offer and I am going to hold you to it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:39:44.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
