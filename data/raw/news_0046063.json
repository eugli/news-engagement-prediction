The lowest max CP cap belongs to Magikarp, with 263.\nThe best attackers and defenders in Pokemon GO T he data dump also included numbers on attack and defence scores - called BaseAttack and BaseDefense. These Base statistics are the same for each Pokemon species, then the Individual scores are random on each Pokemon (between 0 and 15).
