In Dubai, you wait all year for winter and all week for Friday . You mark events in the newspapers and websites to make elaborate plans for things to do over the weekend but fail most of the time! Apart from feeling lazy, there is a list of things that can spoil your Dubai weekend. We list these for you - 1. Sleep versus Friday brunches Friday brunches have become an unsaid tradition in Dubai. After working through the week from Sunday to Thursday , the residents reserve the lazy Fridays for brunches. With unlimited options to choose from at discounted offers, your calendar is never empty. But your body can act as a spoilsport by demanding more sleep. Instead of starting your day with a bang with a Friday brunch, you might end up snuggling in your bed for that much-needed extra sleep you missed during the week. So, make a pick - Friday brunch or sleep! Read : 5 Dubai weekend activities you'll absolutely love 2. When you have a working weekend Yes, this can ruin your weekend and how. With work pressures and rotating shifts, you might end up working on a weekend while your partner and friends are enjoying their brunch. On your way to work, you hate looking at happy, carefree faces in Dubai metros and roads. Worst still would be you receiving a work call on your weekends that you cannot ignore. And you end up spending your weekend in front of a laptop only to realise that the weekend is over. Read: 6 ways to make your weekend productive 3. Does everyone have to get their cars out? While setting outdoors and going on a long drive with overcast skies in Dubai might sound like a plan, beware. The majority of residents in Dubai will get their cars out, clogging the roads. Even those taking Dubai metros and buses on working days will get their vehicles out. So, if you have a dinner reservation for 9 pm in Dubai Marina, start way ahead as the bumper-to-bumper traffic awaits you. 4. Insane surcharge on cab bookings So, you made the right choice by ditching your car and calling a cab for your evening dinner. But you might change your mind looking at the surcharge the cabs might ask for, thanks to heavy bookings. Driving to your destination might sound cheaper and you will end up in the clogged traffic roads. 5. There are queues everywhere Everything is overcrowded - be it the shopping malls, beaches, nightclubs, supermarkets, restaurants, gas stations, or any other place. Looking at the endless line everywhere, ordering a large pizza and watching a movie on Netflix would sound like a perfect weekend plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:16:58.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
