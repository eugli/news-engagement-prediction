Advertisement \nWhether you’re looking for the perfect buffalo wing recipe for the big game, or looking for some dips that won’t ruin your waistline, Google’s new recipe search features can help make your quest a little easier. When you search for a recipe, you’ll see two carousels at the top of your search page. The first uses keywords to narrow down the type of recipe you’re after. For example, if you were searching for chicken wing recipes, you’d get flavor options like “honey,” “buffalo,” “sweet,” and preparation methods like “slow cooker” and “oven roasted.” \nThe second carousel gives you a preview of the most popular recipes that meet your search criteria, so you can quickly swipe through and look for one you like the best. You can try it out for yourself on your mobile browser, or with the Google app on Android and iOS .
