Most Popular By David Grossman Feb 8, 2017 A piece of aviation history is finally getting a resting spot it deserves. The last remaining Concorde jet has been moved to a purpose-built hangar where it will become the centerpiece of a new museum dedicated to British flight. In 1976, the Concorde symbolized the future. Built by the French AÃ©rospatiale and the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), even its name was meant to symbolize the coming together of two ancient foes. One of only two supersonic transports to ever fly commercially (the other was a short-lived Soviet operation), the Concorde regularly flew from London to New York in less than half the time it took other airlines. The joint owners of the plane sought to play up this seemingly futuristic travel plan and advertised the jet as the closest thing to space travel a regular person could get.   Most Popular It's signature look made for a sharp silhouette, but the Concorde suffered from rough press and technological issues from the get-go. Early newspaper reports worries that prolonged time at supersonic speeds could lead to skin cancer , the time period spent at Mach 2 also caused worries about the plane's nose overheating. The plane became seen as a toy of the rich, and its creators often struggled in convincing airlines to buy it. The crash of Air France Flight 4950 in the year 2000, the only fatal flight during the Concorde's run, hurt perceptions as well. Hit by the general downturn in air travel after the 9/11 attacks, all Concordes were grounded in 2003. This particular Concorde, known as Alpha Foxtrot, was in fact the last of those planes to fly. Though its final trip was the ironically short distance from London's Heathrow Airport to Bristol, England on November 26, 2003. It's sat patiently, and now that Aerospace Bristol, a museum dedicated to the region's involvement in air travel, is getting off the ground, it's found a perfect home. \"We couldn't be more delighted to welcome Concorde 216 into her new purpose-built home at Aerospace Bristol,\" said Iain Gray, Chairman of Aerospace Bristol. \"With such enthusiasm for Concorde in this country, and particularly in Bristol where she was designed, built and landed for the final time, it is only fitting that this magnificent aircraft should have a permanent home at Filton. I would like to thank all of our donors for helping to make Aerospace Bristol a reality and look forward to welcoming our first visitors on board this summer.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T12:14:39.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
