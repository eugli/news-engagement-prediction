The Oklahoma attorney general was confirmed Friday to lead the agency he has sued 14 times. by Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt at his confirmation hearing on January 18, 2017 in Washington, DC. By Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images. Despite an all-night protest by Senate Democrats, former Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt was confirmed on Friday to serve as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, placing the stewardship of the nation’s environmental health in the hands of a prominent climate-change skeptic and oil-industry ally who built his career, in part, on trying to destroy the agency he will now lead. Pruitt, a self-described “leading advocate against the E.P.A.'s activist agenda,” endured a particularly contentious confirmation process. Employees at the agency launched an unprecedented revolt ahead of the vote, reportedly calling senators’ offices to block Pruitt’s confirmation, while more than 700 former officials wrote letters to Congress. Democrats, too, stepped up the pressure on their Republican colleagues. On Thursday, an Oklahoma judge ordered Pruitt’s office to release approximately 3,000 e-mails related to his past communications as attorney general with fossil-fuel companies, with whom he worked closely to sue the E.P.A. on 14 separate occasions. Democrats seized on the ruling to urge Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to delay the vote, but their efforts proved futile. Only one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, ultimately broke rank to vote “Nay” on Pruitt, who was confirmed by 52 to 46. Two red-state Democrats, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp or North Dakota, voted “Yea.” Democrats have vowed to continue the fight however they can. “I don’t see any way his tenure at the Environmental Protection Agency ends well,” Sheldon Whitehouse , a Democratic senator from Rhode Island, told Politico ahead of the vote. “Time will tell and facts will [come] out, but I believe our Republican friends will rue the day that they had this nomination rammed through the Senate on the very day that the e-mails were being litigated in Oklahoma, in order to get ahead of any counter-pressure.” Environmental groups, meanwhile, were distraught. Michael Brune , the executive director of the Sierra Club, told The Washington Post that Pruitt’s confirmation augurs a “a full-scale assault on the protections that Americans have enjoyed for clean air, clean water, and a healthy climate.” Climate-change and environmental activists, he added, are “in for the fight of our lives for the next four years.” The changes that could soon come to the E.P.A. may be drastic, though any significant changes are likely to be challenged in court. During his campaign for the White House, Trump made it clear that the E.P.A. and environmental regulations—which he argued made it “impossible for our country to compete”—would be on the chopping block if he was elected president. His appointment of Pruitt, one of the fiercest critics of environmental-protection laws, to lead the agency was seen by many as a fulfillment of that promise. “Personnel is policy,” New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman , a Democrat, told me in a recent interview. Trump “is putting in place people that really are at odds—and in some case fundamentally at odds with the purposes of their agencies. ” Scott Pruitt, he added, “is a climate-change denier, he doesn’t believe that the Environmental Protection Agency is supposed to be the first line of defense to protect our air and water.” Republicans, who have been agitating to roll back environmental regulations and limit the E.P.A.’s mandate, hailed Pruitt as a common-sense solution to years of executive overreach by the Obama administration. “Pruitt is just the candidate we need at the helm of the E.P.A.,” McConnell, a representative of the coal-rich Kentucky, argued on the Senate floor. “He’s exceptionally qualified. He’s dedicated to environmental protection. And, as someone with state government experience, he understands the real-world consequences of E.P.A. actions and knows that balance is the key to making policies that are sustainable over the long-term.” Share ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:06:10.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
