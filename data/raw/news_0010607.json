And two of them came in a play that evoked memories of another do-it-all Patriots running back — in another Super Bowl in Houston.\nAfter cutting the Falcons’ lead to 10 on a touchdown pass to Danny Amendola , the Patriots needed a two-point conversion to make it a one-score game Sunday. White, who was originally sent out wide, came back in motion before the snap to line up next to Brady. Instead of snapping the ball to the quarterback, White took the snap and dived ahead for the conversion.\nWhile the play perhaps surprised the Falcons’ defense, the direct snap is nothing new for longtime Patriots fans.\nIn fact, the play was eerily similar to Kevin Faulk’s two-point conversion in the 2004 Super Bowl against the Carolina Panthers (which was also played in Houston’s NRG Stadium, then called Reliant Stadium). Just like White, Faulk lined up next to Brady in the shotgun and directly received the ball, as the quarterback faked taking the snap.\nIt was not the last time the Patriots used Faulk in a direct-snap play on a two point conversion .\n“It’s a play that we practiced every day, every week,” Faulk told Boston.com last year . “But we only ran it one time a year. It was that type of play.”\nSo let this be a warning to future Patriots opponents: On a crucial two-point conversion, watch for the direct snap.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UGGA69vTcE", "http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/09000d5d801df5b9/Kevin-Faulk-Highlight-WK-19-vs-Chargers-2006"], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:48:48.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
