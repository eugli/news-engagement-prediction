As stealth wealth symbols go, little is as sophisticated as those crafted by the Italian brand established in the Fifties, peacefully presided over by British creative director Ian Griffiths, one of the most under-the-radar designers in the business. This autumn show was an expert exercise in il cappotto, and while the new line-up included interesting hybrids - camel-hair with shearling lapels and backs, classic cashmere with cable knit, buttery leather with yak - the classic coats still packed the ultimate punch. \nPart of that was due to the casting: a line up of fashion's honeyed, healthy girls that included Lily Donaldson, Gigi Hadid, Isabeli Fontana. Their tonal combinations of luxurious layers - rollnecks with sloppy ribbed sweaters, chunky coats with hooded sweaters, cute scarves and mittens - looked just the ticket in ruby red, chocolate, caramel, beige and cream. Griffiths was looking at the season through a Nordic filter, tapping into the sensual hauteur of Ingrid Bergman to give his velvet suiting, pinstriped pencil skirts and their fuller iterations a sexy swagger (he never could resist a pair of cat eye sunglasses to offset the look). Griffiths even managed to rehabilitate the hoodie, wrenching it away from the Vetements streetwise template to render it a mature proposition in double-faced cashmere, a tiny zip at the neck. Proper clothes for grown-ups - lots to earmark here. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:28:06.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
