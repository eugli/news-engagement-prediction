Supplied \nThe Kingston Flyer sitting unused in Kingston in 2015. \nChisholm said the buyers were \"local to the district\" but would not comment further on their identity. \nREAD MORE: \nThe Kingston Flyer and associated land and buildings had been offered for sale by its owner, David Bryce, for $2 million in May 2016, and in July it was revealed there were \"several\" potential buyers. AMBER-LEIGH WOOLF/FAIRFAX NZ \nSouthern Steam Train Charitable Trust chairman Lindsay Buckingham with a 1/6th model replica of an AB class locomotive. \nBryce had owned the Flyer since 2011. \nChisholm said two AB locomotives, about 80 hectares of land, and buildings associated with the Flyer were included in the deal. \nBut whether the Flyer would run again, and whether it would stay in the region was still being considered. \nThe buyers would be consulting with key stakeholders and businesses in the area to help make a decision on what to do with the Flyer, Chisholm said. Ad Feedback \n\"The current focus is on how to enhance the tourism activities of the region in conjunction with new operators. \n\"Opportunities include the reopening of the Kingston Tavern, Bar and Caf√©, and various retail and tourism accommodation uses for the prime 4.6ha land title at Fairlight Station adjoining the world renown fishing spot, the Mataura River,\" he said. \n\"Ongoing discussions are also being held with several parties investigating building a movie studio in the region. \n\"A transport museum and static displays of the rolling stock are being considered and the current turntable and water tank at the Kingston station are to be preserved long term.\" \nTRUST MISSES OUT \nSouthern Steam Train charitable trust chairman Lindsay Buckingham said the trust was not the mystery buyer. \n\"We weren't as far advanced in our studies [as the buyer was], we were not yet in a position to make an offer,\" he said. \nWhile he was disappointed the Flyer had sold to another party, the trust was pleased it had a new owner who would hopefully fully restore the Flyer and the railway. \n\"We hope that it does not suffer the same fate as other ventures before it,\" Buckingham said. \nBased on the research the trust had carried out, Buckingham believed a \"substantial investment\" would be required to get the Flyer back up and running. \n\"We'd like to see it as a complete railway ... we'd hate to see it broken up and spread across the country.\" \nBuckingham said the trust would be open to discussions or a potential partnership with the new buyers, he said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:22:31.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
