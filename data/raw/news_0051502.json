(ABC News: Melanie Vujkovic) \n\"Normal honey for us is worth ... anywhere between $5 and $6 [per kilogram],\" he said. \n\"If we sell privately we can get a little bit more, but the medical honey is worth up to $30, $40 a kilo.\" \nApiarists are already paying hundreds of dollars in permits to use state-owned land where these shrubs were found, but not all of it was usable terrain. \nAny clearing of the land is currently illegal under the Vegetation Management Act 1999. \nQueensland Beekeepers Association president Robert Dewar said it was restricting beekeepers from setting up hives. \n\"We don't want to knock the trees down â€” that's what we depend on,\" he said. \n\"All we're really looking for is a reasonably low growth area, that we can mow around, just to reduce the fire hazard is the main thing.\" \nThe beekeeping industry is mobile in nature and most sites do not require more than 600 square metres of land. \nNew Zealand's Unique Manuka Factory Honey Association said their country's export value was sitting at $275 million, with a goal and potential to reach more than $1 billion. \nWhile the New Zealand Government was working closely with the industry to grow its worth, Mr Dewar said Australia was falling behind. \n\"We know through talking to the beekeepers over there, that New Zealand is pretty well at its limit in production,\" he said. \n\"Yet we've got it here growing in the wild, we've just got to get to it.\" Photo: Honey made from the Manuka shrub, Leptospermum, has germ-fighting qualities. (ABC News: Melanie Vujkovic) \nIn a statement, the Department of Natural Resources and Mines said it was aware of the concerns by Queensland beekeepers and was working on an area management plan to enable apiarists to undertake small-scale clearing for hives. \nBeekeepers believe Manuka could be the very saviour of the industry, set to face another blow when it loses access to national parks by 2024. \nThe change comes after the Queensland Government converted former state forests into national parks in 2004. \nDespite the fact apiary sites have stood in public forests for more than 100 years, national parks ban non-native animals, including bees used for honey production.
