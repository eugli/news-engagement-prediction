I don’t care about her nudes or sexual history and no one should.” \n“Gender specific attacks are disgusting sexist bulls—t,” she added . \nMs. Ratajkowski’s tweets included a screenshot of an article by Teen Vogue writer Brittney McNamara, who agreed that the bullying of Mrs. Trump amounted to “slut shaming.” \n“Like Emily said, this is a gender-based attack,” Ms. McNamara wrote. “It seeks to undermine Melania as an intelligent woman by bringing up her sexual history. It depends upon the old idea that women can’t be both sexual and successful, and that’s frankly just untrue.” \nA New York Times spokesperson said the reporter, who has not been identified, was reprimanded for the remark. \n“At a party last night, a Times reporter who does not cover Washington or politics, referred to an unfounded rumor regarding Melania Trump,” a Times spokesperson said in a statement to Politico. “The comment was not intended to be public, but it was nonetheless completely inappropriate and should not have occurred. Editors have talked to the reporter in question about the lapse.” \nThe Trumps are currently suing British tabloid The Daily Mail for publishing a story that included the unfounded claim that she had once been an escort.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:36:52.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
