I can’t guarantee that I’m here next week, how can I guarantee that a player is here next season?” \nMourinho, though, insisted he wants Rooney to stay, saying: “I would never push, or try to push, a legend of this club to another destiny.” \nHowever, that wasn’t enough to stop a tabloid frenzy on Tuesday night, declaring the skipper’s United career is “effectively over”, with The Mirror reporting that his agent, Paul Stretford, has the clearance to get the England and United legend a move to the Chinese Super League before their window closes on Tuesday.

This morning was the first time he trained and didn’t even train 100 percent with the group,” the Portuguese boss told reporters at Saint-Etienne’s Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. \n“He is injured, I cannot do miracles at that level,” said the boss. \n“Rooney is injured, he (has been) injured for two or three weeks. “When you don’t have a player, you have others. The team is in a good moment. In the past few months we’ve lost only one game and it was one we could lose as it was a two-legged match.” \n- ‘Shaw must wait’ - \nThe Europa League has taken on added importance for United, who are battling on four fronts, as it offers a qualification place to next season’s Champions League for the winners. \nWith United in a tight battle for a top-four finish in the Premier League -- there will likely be three places up for grabs between five teams behind runaway leaders Chelsea -- Mourinho said he wouldn’t be prioritising competitions. \n“I want to win tomorrow (Wednesday). I don’t want to win Europa League or Premier League, I want to win tomorrow,” he said. \n“I want to win the final on Sunday -- Sunday at 7pm. I want to win against Bournemouth in the Premier League. That is the way I think all the time and during my career.” Another player who didn’t make the match-day squad is England international full-back Luke Shaw, who has been out of favour with Mourinho.

They have to work really hard every day, they have to play well, so he has to wait and in this moment he is behind the others.” United won last week’s first leg at Old Trafford 3-0 thanks to Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s hat-trick and Mourinho believes there will be no way back for Saint-Etienne if his team performs well on Wednesday. \n“If we play normally, as we usually play, I think it is mission impossible for Saint-Etienne. \n“Even though I think we played badly in the first 45 minutes of the first leg. I shall tell my players to forget about the final on Sunday. I want my players to be focused.” Sign up for Sportsmail The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
