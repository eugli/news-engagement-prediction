Awi Setiyono (centre), accompanied by Jakarta Police spokesperson Sr. Comr. Raden Prabowo Argo Yuwono (left) and National Police policy analysis head Sr.Comr. Sulistyo Pudjo Hartono (right) speak in a press conference in Jakarta on Dec 11. - The Jakarta Post/Asia News Network \nJAKARTA: Indonesian police will investigate a North Korean restaurant in Central Jakarta that is allegedly being used by the country to run its spy activities. \nSr. Comr. Argo Yuwono said on Sunday that he would coordinate with the Foreign Ministry on a report that was previously published by Singaporean news agency AsiaOne. Argo said the police would look into the restaurant’s licence before making any moves. \n“We need to know first what their business is and who the owner is. There are different regulations for businesses owned by Indonesians and those owned by foreigners,” he said as quoted by tribunnews.com. \nAsiaone reported previously that the North Korean Intelligence Agency (RGB) had been operating in Indonesia for the last two decades. Quoting an anonymous source, the news portal said RGB was known to be operating textile factories in major Indonesian cities, including Jakarta. \nIt had also been reported that a room above the North Korean restaurant in Central Jakarta was part of the agency’s Indonesia office. - The Jakarta Post/Asia News Network", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:47:49.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
