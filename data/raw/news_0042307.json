Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com TownNews.com Content Exchange \nJUPITER, Fla. • Cardinals infielder Jedd Gyorko, the leading slugger returning to a team that wants to bring back the glove, dutifully nodded when asked about the list of positions he might play for the team this spring. \n“And catcher,” he said. “Don’t forget catcher.” \nIn an emergency, he knows squat. \nAs position players joined the mix this week for the first full-squad workout of spring training Friday and the first high-speed, full-squad workout of spring training Saturday, Gyorko is the man of many positions and one big bat. How he intends to approach his fielding this spring is a bit different than last year, when he came to spring training believing he’d have a crack at second base and then, suddenly, being thrown into the mix at shortstop. \nThis spring, knowing he’s a utility fielder, Gyorko intends to commit a day to a position. If he’s starting at second that day, he’ll stick to second before the game. If it’s a good day to work at shortstop, he’ll spend the day at shortstop. Gyorko expects to see work at third, second, shortstop, and even first base. \n“Each and every day, a focus,” Gyorko said. “It’s pretty similar to what I did last season, but I think there’s the one position each day that makes sense.” \nAs a utility infielder a year ago, Gyorko led the Cardinals with 30 home runs, and only Minnesota’s Bryan Dozier hit more home runs in the second half of the season than Gyorko. His power surge after the All-Star break earned him increasing playing time and prominence in the lineup on his way to a .243/.306/.495. No one hit 30 homers in fewer at-bats than Gyorko, and he was the only player in the majors with as many as 30 homers and fewer than 110 hits total. He had 97. \nGyorko started 39 games at second, 28 at third, and 25 at shortstop, though most of those came when Aledmys Diaz (hand) was on the disabled list. The Cardinals had advertised Gyorko as their opening day shortstop – and the next day Diaz arrived. \nThis spring, the Cardinals have positioned Gyorko as the challenger at third base to Jhonny Peralta. He could also emerge as the complement to Kolten Wong in a platoon at second base. Gyorko is a capable fielder at either position, perhaps even better at third. Wong is the superior fielder at second base – and that is why the Cardinals intend on starting Wong there as a way to improve the overall defense. Still, Gyorko represents something the Cardinals will miss from the lineup without him in it. \nPower. \nHis bat might be necessary. \nWhat glove he needs is TBD. \n“In spring training everybody is going to get at-bats,” manager Mike Matheny said. “Jedd’s versatility will allow him to get it in multiple positions. No, that isn’t an issue that I see at this point. Nor am I saying that it’s going to be one in the season because we don’t know how this will play out.” \nAccording to Gyorko’s schedule, it will one position and one day at a time. *** \nDAY 2 NOTES: The Cardinals officially added Mitch Harris to major-league camp. He has been rehabbing alongside the major-league pitchers for several weeks as he attempts to prove he’ll be ready for the start of the season. Harris had the ligament in his right elbow repaired, though he did not require a full reconstruction or Tommy John surgery. … Junior Fernandez and Jake Woodford have also been added to the camp to provide needed arms. Woodford is a prized prospect that some within the organization see as primed for a breakout year, and Fernandez is a power arm, if a tad wild. … The Cardinals’ schedule on Saturday was shorter so that all of the players and coaches could attend an autograph session for season ticket holders of the High-A affiliate here in Jupiter, Fla. There are some people who purchase the season tickets just for a crack at the annual autograph jubilee. … Yadier Molina is expected to return to camp Sunday. Molina traveled to his hometown in Puerto Rico where he has purchased a team there. That team is opening the season and dedicating it to Molina’s father, a star player in the league. Molina’s brothers and family all converged for the celebration. \n-30-", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:33:09.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
