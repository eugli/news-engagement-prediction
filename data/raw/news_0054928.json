The latest assault came from Mumbai based columnist and author Shobhaa De , who on Tuesday posted the obese cop's photo with the tweet: \"Heavy police bandobast in Mumbai today.\" \n\nSoon after, De's tweet was slammed by Mumbai Police on the grounds that it was \"misplaced\" and the \"uniform/official\" was not from their force. It added: \"We expect better from responsible citizens like you.\" \n\nThe photo that De tweeted out was that of Jogawat, from Madhya Pradesh police . Jogawat, who is due to retire in 2019, told TOI: \"I am planning to consult my lawyer and will think about sending a notice to De. It hurts when I see my photo on social media or when people tell me about it. India is a democratic country and people have freedom to express their views, but it shouldn't hurt or shame someone.\" \n\nHe added: \"Shobha De is a big personality and people of such prominence should express or write responsibly. Had she body shamed someone close to him? I am not fat since childhood. I became fat when my gall bladder was removed as it was infected because of stones. She posted my picture on her account but will she pay for my treatment.\" \n\nJogawat informed that he don't know who clicked his picture and circulated on social media. He said, \"it may have been clicked during an out station duty but I don't who clicked it. It's an old picture when I was an sub inspector.\" \n\nPictures of Jogawat picture has also been tagged on various websites such as Funny Indian police images, Indian police- Majakia.com, and efficient Indian police -lol. \nBy Wednesday, De had backtracked, but had a piece of advice for MP Police: \"Mumbai/Maharashtra Police, pranaam. No offence intended. M.P. police, consult a dietician, if it's an asli, undoctored image doing the rounds. \n\nTalking to TOI, MP DGP Rishi Kumar Shukla said, \"The police are often made soft targets. Be it bomb blast or an earth quake or a Tsunami. The police are talked about in a spiteful manner.\" A devastated Jogawat feels people are using his image for shaming police. \n\nHe told TOI: \"But they don't know how I became fat and what I have to go through when I see my picture posted. I have a family. I have two sons and a daughter who have completed their studies and are working as well. Just imagine what they must be thinking. I am fat but my work is good and is appreciated by my senior officers. \n\nJogawat joined police force in 1979 as a police constable with Ratlam police. He has also worked in his capacity as a police officer in Shajapur and Ujjain. He is presently posted at police lines Nimuch, before which he worked in his capacity as an officer at Badhana, Jawad and Ratangarh police stations of Nimuch district. \nIn year 1993 he went under the operation of gall bladder after which he gradually gained weight and became obese.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:33:43.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
