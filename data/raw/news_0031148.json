Follow our guide Anita Iyer Filed on February 14, 2017 | Last updated on February 14, 2017 at 08.38 am Share Vote \n(Reuters) Canada ranks high on quality of life for expats. Follow our steps if migrating is on cards for you. Few expats love the idea of relocating to a new country and exploring a new lifestyle. For expats in the UAE on a lookout for a new experience, Canada should be on their go-to list as it is one of most welcoming countries for immigrants across the world. Canada ranks highly on the quality of life meter with its high-quality education, healthcare, and low crime rate. The country has put in place a fast-track system for immigration called Express Entry to facilitate seamless immigration process. This system allows skilled workers to make a transition into a role in Canada. 10 questions Dubai expats are tired of hearing WHO CAN APPLY? Express Entry is used to manage applications for permanent residence under these federal economic immigration programs - the Federal Skilled Worker Program, the Federal Skilled Trades Program, and the Canadian Experience Class. HOW TO APPLY? To begin with, potential candidates need to complete online Express Entry profile online, providing information like skills, work experience, language ability, education among other details here. GETTING SHORTLISTED Candidates are then given a score out of 1,200 and those meeting the minimum Comprehensive Ranking Score are invited to apply for permanent residency. They are awarded points for the job offer, a nomination form a province or territory and/or skills and experience factors. A candidate gets additional points for a qualifying education in Canada, a valid job offer or a nomination by a province or territory. These additional points can make a candidate rank high enough to be invited to apply for the next eligible round of invitations. 5 things you should do if you are about to lose your job in Dubai HOW LONG IS THE WAIT? If you are invited to apply, you will have 90 days to submit an online application for permanent residence. Once you are on the list, Citizenship and Immigration Canada will process the majority of complete applications (meaning those with all the necessary supporting documents) in six months or less. Candidates can stay in the pool for up to 12 months. If you fail to get an invitation to apply for permanent residence within 12 months of submitting an Express Entry profile, candidates can submit a new profile.
