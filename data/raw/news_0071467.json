The Vertical's Adrian Wojnarowski reported that Andrew Bogut, who won the 2015 NBA championship as a member of the Golden State Warriors, will also head to Philly to complete the deal: \nThough that may seem like a high price for the Mavs to pay for an under-utilized center, Wojnarowski added that Dallas has had its eyes on Noel for a while. \nIn less than 20 minutes per game with the Sixers, Noel averaged 8.9 points and five rebounds. He's only appeared in 29 games for Philly this year after spending the beginning of the season in the D League. \nAs for Bogut, it seems unlikely the young Sixers squad will have much use for him. Therefore, he may be a candidate for a buyout, which ESPN reporter Chris Haynes said might catch the Cleveland Cavaliers eye: \nWhether that happens or not remains to be seen, but the Cavaliers could certainly use a backup center for Tristan Thompson and the defense-minded Bogut would seemingly be a good fit. \nThere are still a couple of hours left before Thursday's 3 p.m. Eastern time deadline, so more pieces will be moved around before then. The 76ers might just be getting started. Topics: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:11:04.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
