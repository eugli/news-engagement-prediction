Compensation \nHe added court that survey work done after the building of the existing A6 showed swans foraging \"right up to the road\". \n\"It's people that disturb swans, not cars,\" he said. \nThe department's lawyer added that the proposed new dual carriageway had a relatively small impact on the foraging grounds for swans and that they regularly changed where they fed. \nEarlier the court heard 133 landowners have had their ground vested along the proposed route. \nThe department has already bought the land and agreed compensation. \nAs Mr Murphy was not seeking the quashing of the vesting orders, if he won, the department would be left with the land and the compensation bill. \nThis, the lawyer said, would be a \"severe potential public prejudice\" not just to the public purse but to landowners who had not opposed the vesting orders.
