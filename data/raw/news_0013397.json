Because, Acosta said, the list includes Paris, San Bernardino, Brussels, Istanbul, and Nice––all of which Acosta said the press “covered extensively.” \n“It’s puzzling,” he observed, “as to why the White House would include these attacks on this list when they were covered for days on end.” \nCNN’s Dan Merica posted the full list he received on Twitter: A White House official says \"most\" of these 78 attacks since 2014 have not received enough attention from media. pic.twitter.com/v66rcHxAFI \n— Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) February 7, 2017 \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:02:15.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
