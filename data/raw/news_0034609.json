Too bad free porn is still easy to access\". \nOn Monday, Mr Hefner wrote: \"I'll be the first to admit that the way in which the magazine portrayed nudity was dated. \n\"Nudity was never the problem because nudity isn't a problem,\" added the 25-year-old son of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. Image copyright AP Image caption Playboy was founded by Hugh Hefner in 1953 \nSamir Husni, a journalism professor at the University of Mississippi, said Playboy's ban on nudity had probably alienated more readers than it attracted. \n\"Playboy and the idea of non-nudity is sort of an oxymoron,\" he said. \nThe magazine still had to find a way to appeal to a younger audience in a digital age where nudity has become commonplace, Mr Husni added. \nIn next month's issue, the magazine will also revive some of its old franchises, including The Playboy Philosophy and Party Jokes. \nIt also features an essay by actress Scarlett Byrne about the Free the Nipple campaign - a movement that started in the US to change laws around breastfeeding in public and female toplessness. \nByrne writes \"about the importance of owning female sexuality and the double standards that still exist between women and men\", the magazine says. \nHowever, Playboy will drop the subtitle Entertainment for Men from its covers. \n\"Playboy will always be a lifestyle brand focused on men's interests, but as gender roles continue to evolve in society, so will we,\" Mr Hefner said. \nPlayboy, which was founded in 1953, stopped printing nude photos in March 2016. \nIts US owners said at the time that he internet had made nudity outdated, and pornographic magazines were no longer so commercially viable. \nPlayboy's circulation has dropped from its peak 5.6 million in the 1970s to below 700,000 last year. \nHowever, the magazine's logo showing a rabbit head wearing a bow tie is one of the most recognisable in the world. \nThe company makes most of its money from licensing it around the world to sell products including toiletries, drinks and jewellery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:58:53.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
