NBA Australia \nPublished on Jan. 29, 2017 \nJan. 29, 2017 \nSteph Curry will miss his first game of the season, sitting out today's game against the Portland Trail Blazers with a stomach flu. \nMORE: NBA players potentiallay affected by Trump's new immigration order \nCurry played through quad soreness in yesterday's blowout win over the Los Angeles Clippers, but still managed to drop 43 points in three quarters. \nWhile Kevin Durant has taken the reigns early in the season, yesterday's performance was a stark reminder for fans, just what kind of monster the Warriors become when Steph is in the driver's seat. \n“I just said to him, ‘Don’t worry about me,'” Durant told ESPN \n“I said, ‘Just play your game. I’ll figure it out. I’ll figure it out around you. You’re the engine of this team, and I know that. I’m not trying to come over and feel like everything just revolves around me. Just do you, man. \nWhilst the two have taken turns of being 'the man' in Golden State tihs season, once they figure it out completely, they will be borderline unstoppable. \nThankfully for the Blazers, they'll just have to deal with Durant.
