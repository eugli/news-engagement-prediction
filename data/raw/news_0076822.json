We give them dresses, we make the dresses, but we don’t pay,” Lagerfeld said. As far as Lagerfeld and Chanel are concerned, the dress still has Streep’s name on it. “She could keep the dress because of the size,” Lagerfeld said. “It’s couture. It’s perfect for her.” \nVery disappointing, Lagerfeld continued, “A genius actress, but cheapness also, no?” \nLagerfeld then backed away from his comments, saying he misunderstood that Streep may have chosen another designer due to remuneration, which Streep’s team has confirmed is not the case. “I regret this controversy and wish Ms Streep well with her 20th Academy Award nomination,” he said. \nOn Saturday, Streep issued a statement to WWD: “In reference to Mr. Lagerfeld’s ‘statement’, there is no ‘controversy’: Karl Lagerfeld , a prominent designer, defamed me, my stylist and the illustrious designer whose dress I chose to wear, in an important industry publication.” \nThe nominated actress continued: “I do not take this lightly, and Mr Lagerfeld’s generic ‘statement’ of regret for this ‘controversy’ was not an apology.” \nThe role of celebrity stylists in Hollywood has become so established that fashion houses typically spend weeks courting the talent, presenting the frock, often only to be overlooked. \nThe role of the stylist has become, in many cases, critical. Leading Hollywood stylist Kate Young told Business of Fashion last week that part of her job was convincing brands that actors were right for them. \n“Brands have an approved list. When I ask for clothes with a new client, I often get a quick no. That’s when I get on the phone or take them to lunch and say: ‘This is what I’m doing with her. This is my vision. You can trust me not to misuse the clothes.’ Sometimes it works right away, sometimes it never works.” \nThe Hollywood Reporter now publishes a competitive ranking of the film industry’s most powerful fashion intermediaries. At the very least, but not always, they serve to ensure that actors do not swerve off into ill-advised or otherwise self-created created accidents in the costume department. \nThe trade publication recently published an article looking back at memorable mis-fires, drawing attention to Melanie Griffiths’ outfit to the 1989 awards at which she was nominated for Working Girl. “You look at it and gag,” noted red-carpet critic and author of 100 Unforgettable Dresses Hal Rubenstein.
