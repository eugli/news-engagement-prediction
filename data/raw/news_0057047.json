He’s just got to figure it out, but he’s still really, really young. He can be a little aggressive at the plate, but I’d rather have a guy want to do something than be timid and almost think too much.” Christian Colon, who drove in the winning run in the 2015 World Series clincher and will compete for the starting second base job, likes what he sees so far. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Thirty-six homers? He’s got the pop to do it, no doubt about it,” Colon said. “His pop would play everywhere. But it’s about winning games, and that’s what we’re trying to tell him: ‘Don’t worry about the homers; if you’re helping us win games, that’s all that matters.’” Photo Alex Gordon hit a tying home run in the ninth inning of Game 1 of the 2015 World Series. He is one of the Royals stars under club control for the next four seasons. Credit Christopher Smith for The New York Times Soler reiterated that point in an interview through an interpreter. He smiled and said that while he was not aware of the Royals’ home run record, he was not concerned with statistics. He has never played at Kauffman Stadium but knows its reputation. “The guys are telling me about that, that the field is pretty big,” Soler said. As for Colon’s suggestion that his power could translate well, Soler said: “I don’t really know, but when I hit the ball, hopefully it just goes out. I think it will.” Moore could have traded Davis for prospects, but instead he got an everyday player who should make an immediate impact. Soler has flaws; his defense in right field must improve, and he has 211 strikeouts in 211 career games. There is work to be done for Soler to be a consistent force, but the raw power is enticing. “We just want him to feel comfortable, settle in — don’t put too much pressure on yourself,” Moore said. “He’s changing leagues and is going to try to do a lot. I remember Player Development 101 in developing young power hitters is to make sure they understand power production comes later. Learn to hit first; learn to center the ball on the bat in different areas of the strike zone. That’s the most important part if you want your power to play.” In the best case, Soler will give the Royals a reasonably priced run producer under contract through 2020, with an annual salary under $5 million. They lost a valuable part of their core last month when starter Yordano Ventura was killed in a car crash in the Dominican Republic. But they still retain control over Perez, starter Danny Duffy and left fielder Alex Gordon for four more seasons. That should give the team a chance to stay competitive even if Hosmer, Cain and the others leave. If the Royals cannot re-sign them first, and fall out of contention early this summer, Moore could be forced to make more trades. “We all realize there’s a business side of it, and at the same time, we all realize we have a G.M. that’s going to bat for us and doing everything he can to keep us all together,” Hosmer said. “There’s never been a question in any of our minds that Dayton hasn’t done everything he can for this group to win and win right now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:58:22.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
