He produced a document to back his ownership statement. \nSeveral Nationalist MPs including Simon Busuttil in tweets this morning poured scorn on the claim. \nThe Nationalist Party has long questioned the ownership of Egrant, noting that it was set up through Nexia BT at the same time as minister Konrad Mizzi and chief of staff Keith Schembri set up their companies in Panama. \nToday's claim comes just before a European Parliament committee starts its work in Malta as park of investigations into the Panama Papers scandal. \nTimes of Malta reported yesterday that EP committee has asked Nexia BT to say who owns Egrant. \nIt asked Nexia BT to say who is the beneficial owner of Egrant and to state whether the owner is involved in politics. \nMEPs also want to know why Nexia BT chose to send the details of the beneficiary owner of Egrant through a Skype call instead of through e-mails as in the case of Dr Mizzi and Mr Schembri. Hey @mzpnmalta goodluck explaining @SimonBusuttil #laktarpolitikugiddieb that there is no more wind in his sails.
