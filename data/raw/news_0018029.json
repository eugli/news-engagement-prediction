Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) about his misrepresentation of his military record in Vietnam. \nThat’s false, and it only took Cuomo seconds to prove it. \nTrump tweeted his criticism of Cuomo Thursday morning, repeating his claim that the network is “fake news”: Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave \"service\" in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 \nMinutes later, Cuomo and his colleagues David Gregory and Poppy Harlow read Trump’s tweet out loud on CNN, and debunked it immediately with video. \"The President ... is once again off on the facts\": @ChrisCuomo 's response to @realDonaldTrump 's tweet about him https://t.co/ckWo75HT8L — CNN (@CNN) February 9, 2017 \n”[That was] literally the first point I made in the interview,” Cuomo said. “The president, with all due respect, is once again off on the facts. That’s not something that any of us have any desire to say on a regular basis, but it keeps being true.” Also on HuffPost The World Protests President Trump The World Protests President Trump 1 9 London People protest against the US travel and immigration ban from seven Muslim-majority countries and demand President Donald Trump's planned state visit to the UK to be cancelled in Westminster, London, England on January 30, 2017.
