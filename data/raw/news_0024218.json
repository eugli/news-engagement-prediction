REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni \nWASHINGTON Feb 9 The number of Americans filing \nfor unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week to near a \n43-year low, amid a further tightening of the labor market that \ncould eventually spur faster wage growth. \nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped \n12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000 for the week ended Feb. \n4, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That left claims just \nshy of the 43-year low of 233,000 touched in early November. \nClaims have now remained below 300,000, a threshold \nassociated with a strong labor market, for 101 straight weeks. \nThat is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market \nwas much smaller. \nThe labor market is at or close to full employment, with the \nunemployment rate at 4.8 percent. It hit a nine-year low of 4.6 \npercent in November. \nFurther tightening in labor market conditions could boost wage growth, which has remained stubbornly sluggish despite anecdotal evidence of more companies struggling to find qualified workers. \nLackluster wage growth, if sustained, could hurt consumer \nspending and crimp economic growth. Economists polled by Reuters \nhad forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising \nto 250,000 in the latest week. \nA Labor Department analyst said there were no special \nfactors influencing last week's data and no states had been \nestimated. \nThe four-week moving average of claims, considered a better \nmeasure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week \nvolatility, fell 3,750 to 244,250 last week, the lowest level \nsince November 1973. \nThe claims report also showed the number of people still \nreceiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 15,000 \nto 2.08 million in the week ended Jan. 28. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims fell 3,750 to 2.08 million. \n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao) \n((Lucia.Mutikani@thomsonreuters.com; 1 202 898 8315; Reuters \nMessaging: lucia.mutikani.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T15:47:31.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
