You know what they say: America runs on Dunkin’. \nAdvertisement You know what else may be contributing to blue state weight gain? Trudeau Envy. You look at Canada’s adorable little prime minister, making what appear to be well-considered remarks, saying Canada will welcome those fleeing persecution, terror and war, and you find yourself thinking: What a decent fellow. I’ve made fun of Canada’s indiscriminate niceness for years, but I now see our friends to the north have more than thick-cut bacon going for them. Canadian bacon really is delicious. I especially like it as a winter snack, broiled in brown sugar and maple syrup and accompanied with a glass of icy Champagne. What’s the president tweeting today? “Our legal system is broken.” Leave the bottle. I must confess: I do find blaming Mr. Trump a pleasant change from the things I usually blame for my overeating: a miserable love life; an ecstatic love life; the stress of too much to do; the stress of nothing to do; a mother who is driving me crazy; a mother who, thanks to a major stroke three years ago, is certifiably crazy. My mother, living in a Westchester nursing home, was my primary trigger for eating the wrong stuff for the past few months. She had developed an obsession with newborn babies, particularly boys. “Let’s go to the nursery and look at the babies,” she’d say. “That would be really nice, Ma, but they don’t have a nursery here,” I’d say. “Yes, they do,” Ma would say. “With the boys, the nurses have to wash their little penises.” It got me down, particularly the penis bit, which made me think my mother had pitched her tent in Krafft-Ebing territory. But one of my brothers stocks my mother’s room with chocolate covered biscuits and Hershey’s Kisses and cookies, so relief was never more than three feet away. Are you non-Weight Watchers aware that one Hershey’s Kiss is the equivalent of a pat of butter? Give me a half-hour with my mother and I am good for a double handful; I inhale those suckers as if in a trance, and when I come to my senses, the floor is awash in silver confetti. It should be a wake-up call. But I know there is orange marzipan in the bureau under the television and I have not hit bottom yet. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
