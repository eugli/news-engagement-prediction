Get f**ked,” he said.\n“You killed my grandson, you killed my little boy, you’re dead son. That c**t killed my grandson and you’re letting him out. I will kill the c**t myself, man.\n“Motherf**king dog, he gets out and I’ll kill him myself.”\nMajor Crash Inspectors examine a car at a neighbouring property. Picture: Naomi Jellicoe Source: News Corp Australia \nBullock, 52, is charged with causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of an accident over crash on Sunday night.\nThe car allegedly crashed into the boy on Branksome Tce in Dover Gardens, near the intersection of Crown St, just after 8pm.\nThe boy died at the scene.\nThe car allegedly involved in the crash was found in the driveway of a nearby house. Officers entered the property and spoke with Bullock, who was taken away by police.\nDuring his brief court appearance on Monday, council for Bullock asked he be considered for home detention bail.\nProsecutors said they would not oppose that release so long as Bullock could provide a suitable bail address.\nA silent floral tribute at the site a 2-year-old died last night after being hit by a car in Dover Gardens. @theTiser pic.twitter.com/gJ7gjckBK0 \n— Mitch Mott (@MitchMottTiser) February 12, 2017 Magistrate Rodney Oates ordered the home detention bail report and remanded Bullock in custody until Friday — prompting the grieving man’s outburst.\nThe man and his supporters, who were not abusive, were escorted from court by half a dozen Sheriff&apos;s Officers.\nHe could be heard punching or kicking the walls of the elevator before more officers directed him out of the building and on to Angas St.\nAt the crash site on Monday, resident Adrian Charlton, who lives opposite the family, said he tried to resuscitate the child.\n“I heard the mum screaming and my wife called out to me to come and help,” he said.\n“The poor mum was sitting with the boy. He wasn’t responsive ...\n“I did CPR for about 10 minutes until the ambulance arrived.”\nTributes were laid on Monday at the spot where the young boy died.\nNeighbour Kizze Rankine placed a single rose from her garden at the end of the driveway, saying it was a tribute to the “energetic” little boy who loved playing in her garden.\nResidents of Branksome Tce said the death of the little boy, one of four young children in the family, was “tragic” and “heartbreaking”.\nThe children were well known for playing in their front yard, occasionally straying down the street.\nAnyone with information on the incident is asked to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.\nOriginally published as ‘You killed my little boy, you’re dead son’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:29:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
