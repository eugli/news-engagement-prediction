Gervin wasted little time in even setting up a visit after officially adding them to the scholarship list last week. \nhttps://twitter.com/KalonGervin/status/831138578474336257 \nArkansas, Cal, Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Louisville, LSU, Maryland, Michigan, Michigan State, Minnesota, Mississippi State, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Penn State, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wisconsin were some other offers on the table. \nGervin makes seven commitments total for Notre Dame in the junior class and he’s the first cornerback to come on board. After suffering a couple de-commitments before National Signing Day, the Irish didn’t sign any at the position in the Class of 2017. \nGervin is also a rarity in terms of his prep program and Notre Dame recruiting. The 5-foot-11, 170-pound athlete plays at Detroit powerhouse Cass Tech, long a difficult place for Notre Dame to recruit. \nRecent forays into Cass Tech have included former five-star receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones (Michigan), four-star safety Jaylen Kelly-Powell (Michigan) and four-star running back Mike Weber (Ohio State), among others. \nGervin joins four-star linebacker Ovie Oghoufo, another Detroit area product, in the commitment column for Notre Dame. Oghoufo hails from nearby Farmington Hills. \nScout.com ranks Gervin at No. 296 overall and No. 28 at cornerback. With Gervin in the fold, six of Notre Dame’s seven commitments are rated in the four-star range. \n“Kalon is a good sized corner with good speed,” said Allen Trieu, Midwest recruiting manager for Scout. “He has been lauded by his coaches and trainers for his technique and work ethic. At Cass Tech, the secondary is always so loaded that sometimes it takes longer for the younger guys to shine. \n“Last year, he was in a secondary with many other D1 guys. He was largely avoided in the games we saw him play. As a result, he may not have an eye popping highlight tape but he has a good combination of measureables and intangibles and will have an opportunity to move up the national rankings at several spring camps.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:29:48.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
