Because of this, it is no longer possible to put off the debate,” said a statement prefacing the legislation, submitted by Adele Gambaro, a member of the small centrist Liberal Popular Alliance, whose initiative has the support of the bigger parties.

News items that would “cause alarm to the public” or “damage the public interest” will be punishable by up to one year in jail. \nTraditional media outlets – newspapers and TV – would be exempt from the legislation. \n“The internet has certainly expanded the boundaries of our freedom by giving us the opportunity to express ourselves on a global scale,” wrote Gambaro. “But freedom of expression cannot turn into a synonym for lack of control where control, in the information era, means correct news, for the protection of users.” \nAdditionally, operators of any online news outlets – including bloggers, and forum administrators – would have to apply for a license from the state to operate their website, as well as submitting their name, address, and tax data. \nThe proposal also calls for students to undergo special “media literacy” courses that would help them distinguish between reliable and deceptive sources of information. ‘Authoritarian tool’ \nThe proposed law immediately provoked a furious backlash. \nMultiple civil rights activists say the definition of “fake news” in the legislation is so broad as to be indefinable, while the whole principle of punishing people for publishing news is authoritarian.

If the commission rules a story to be fake, a publishing newspaper would have to print front-page apologies. \nDigital rights lawyer Carlo Piana told The Local that the law unfairly singles out online media, placing “absurd obligations on blogs and communication platforms.” He said the law would also most likely contravene EU directives.

But unfortunately, they're in parliament,” said Piana, who told the website that he had tried to present his objections to Gambaro on Twitter, but she immediately blocked him. \nDespite numerous objections to the law, and media speculation that it will not pass through the Senate, Gambaro is undeterred. \n“This text is a first step. We know it’s an enormous task, but we want to try, and we are open to debate,” said the politician.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:08:02.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
