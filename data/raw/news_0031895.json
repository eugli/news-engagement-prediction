As announced on the “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” show which aired on Tuesday (Wednesday in Manila), the 24-year-old blonde bombshell will appear in three separate covers of the famed magazine, which hits newsstands tomorrow. The 2017 SI Swimsuit Covers have been revealed. Welcome back, @KateUpton !

However, despite her crowd-favorite status among readers, Upton revealed that SI did not inform her about her appearance on the cover up until just a day before the big announcement. “They’re very difficult to read,” she told the show’s host Jimmy Kimmel with a laugh. “They just completely ghost you. They finally gave me a call yesterday.” Aside from Upton, SI’s latest edition will also include a slew of other big name ladies who made a splash in 2016. Olympians Simone Biles and Aly Raisman will make their magazine debut, while Hannah Jeter—the wife of retired New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter—returns for her fifth appearance since 2015. “I am thrilled to include the gold medal-winning, U.S. women’s gymnasts Aly Raisman and Simone Biles in this year’s Swimsuit issue,” SI swimsuit issue editor MJ Day told Sports Illustrated. “Aly and Simone represent all that is beautiful and strong and inspiring in women today.” Meanwhile, “Entertainment Tonight” also revealed that Chrissy Teigen, Christie Brinkley, Hailey Clauson and Nina Agdal, among others, will also be featured in the latest issue.
