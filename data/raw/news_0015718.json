Feb6,20175:49PMEST \nAt long last, Lamborghini's highly anticipated $200,000 super SUV will finally start rolling off production lines. \nLamborghini will begin production of the Urus SUV in April, CEO Stefano Domenicali said in a new interview with Digital Trends . Rich hipsters won't be able to buy the Urus just yet, however -- the first few cars will be prototypes, says Domenicali. The prototypes will be used by Lamborghini dealers to help train salespeople on the features of the Urus and drive early consumer awareness. \n\"Everything has to be perfect when the Urus lands on the market -- it will be a new market, and new customers,\" Domenicali points out. The executive didn't say specifically when the car would become available, except to note that \"2017 will be a very important year for us.\" \nThe Urus is Lamborghini's second off-road vehicle ever after the LM002 (pictured below) from the 1980s, which gained the moniker \"Rambo Lambo\" due to its enormous size. It's rumored to be powered by an Audi-derived 4.0 liter, twin-turbo V8 engine. A hybrid variation may also be in the works. The Urus will compete with Bentley's new Bentayga, the BMW X6 M, the Land Rover Supercharged, Mercedes-Benz's ML63 AMG and Porsche's Cayenne Turbo. \nLamborghini reportedly only wants to churn out 2,500 to 3,000 units of the Urus each year to keep it exclusive.
