Quinton Rose had 12 points and Daniel Dingle finished with 10. \nTrailing by as many as 15 points in the second half, Temple pulled within six with just under 8 minutes remaining. But Ojeleye answered with a big 3-pointer to stymie the Owls' rally. \nOjeleye, a Duke transfer, also fueled a 16-1 SMU run in the first half with 10 points during the spurt. He started it with a thunderous dunk while being fouled by Mark Williams, who was called for a flagrant on the play. \nThe Mustangs, ranked third nationally in scoring defense, held the Owls without a field goal for more than 9 minutes during that stretch. For the game, Temple shot 31.5 percent from the field while committing 16 turnovers. \nBIG PICTURE \nSMU: This is the fourth straight season in which the Mustangs have been ranked but they have bigger things in mind, hoping to win the AAC and get back to the NCAA Tournament for the second time in three years. Despite a 25-5 overall record, SMU missed out on last season's Big Dance due to NCAA infractions. \nTemple: The Owls missed a chance to beat a ranked team for the third time this season. Since a strong opening month, they have dealt with tough injuries to Josh Brown (out since mid-December) and Trey Lowe (out for the season) and are in danger of missing the postseason for just the third time in coach Fran Dunphy's 11-year tenure. \nUP NEXT \nSMU: The Mustangs host No. 11 Cincinnati in a nationally ranked showdown Sunday with first place up for grabs in the conference. The Bearcats, unbeaten in the AAC, are the only team that has defeated SMU in league play this season. \nTemple: The Owls begin a two-game trip at Memphis on Sunday afternoon. \n___ \nMore AP college basketball: www.collegebasketball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25.
