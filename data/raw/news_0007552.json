Exodus is a very big issue for us,\" he said, adding, \"BJP will not let western Uttar Pradesh turn into another Kashmir.\" \n\nBJP MP Hukum Singh had in June last year claimed that close to 350 Hindus had left Kairana over alleged threats and extortion by criminal elements belonging to a particular community. \n\nThe Lok Sabha member from Gorakhpur claimed that in eastern part of UP, both Hindu and Muslim population was safe. \n\n\"In eastern UP, if a Hindu is safe, so is a Muslim,\" he said. \n\nThe BJP's star campaigner said the issue of love jihad will certainly be a crucial point in the polls. \n\n\"Love jihad was then an issue and it is still an issue,\" he said. \n\nWhen asked about the agenda of his \"anti-Romeo squads\", the controversial leader said the \"force\" will work towards restoring pride of women and ending discriminations. \n\n\"There are areas in western UP where girls can't go to school. The squad will work for their rights and ensure safety of women in the state,\" he said. \n\nThe BJP leader also lashed out at the Akhilesh Yadav government and others for wooing minorities in a Hindu majority society by announcing sops for them. \n\n\"Political leaders in this country speak against majority community in the name of secularism. Governments in UP give land for kabristan (graveyard) but not for shamshanghat (cremation ground),\" he said. \n\"If voted to power, BJP's development schemes will be above caste and religion,\" he promised, adding, \"It will be 'sabka sath, sabka vikaas' in true spirit.\" \n\nTo a question as to who will hold the reins of the state if BJP comes to power, he evaded a direct reply saying, \"Face is not important, my wish is that BJP forms government in Uttar Pradesh.\" \n\nWhen asked if he saw himself occupying the top chair, the five-time MP said, \"There are leaders more senior to me in BJP, I can't push them and seize power. We have Rajnath Singh , Kalraj Mishra and some other leaders who can become CM face.\" \n\n\"Every BJP worker is capable of becoming UP CM,\" he remarked.
