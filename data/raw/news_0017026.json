A federal judge in Washington state put the order on hold Friday.\nFederal government lawyers say the ruling by the judge, James Robart, was overly broad and should be overruled.\nIt was not immediately clear when the 9th Circuit might rule, but the legal fight may ultimately reach the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThis is a breaking news alert. Check back later for more.\nEARLIER STORY: WASHINGTON — The fierce battle over President Donald Trump's travel and refugee ban edged up the judicial escalator Monday, headed for a possible final face-off at the Supreme Court. Travelers, temporarily unbound, tearfully reunited with loved ones at U.S. airports.\nThe Justice Department prepared to ask a San Francisco-based federal appeals court to restore Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations. The lawyers were expected to argue in a brief that the president, not the courts, has the authority to set national security policy and that an executive order to control access at the country's borders is lawful.\nThe filing with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was to be the latest salvo in a high-stakes legal fight surrounding Trump's order, which was halted Friday by a federal judge in Washington state.\nThe appeals court refused to immediately reinstate the ban, and lawyers for Washington and Minnesota — two states challenging it — argued anew on Monday that any resumption would \"unleash chaos again,\" separating families and stranding university students.\nIt's not clear how quickly the appeals court might rule. Whatever the outcome, either side could ask the Supreme Court to intervene.\nIt could prove difficult, though, to find the necessary five votes at the high court to undo a lower court order; the Supreme Court has been at less than full strength since Justice Antonin Scalia's death a year ago. The last immigration case that reached the justices ended in a 4-4 tie.\nThe president's executive order has faced legal uncertainty ever since Friday's ruling by U.S. District Judge James Robart,\nwhich challenged both Trump's authority and his ability to fulfill a campaign promise.\n© The Associated Press Nazanin Zinouri, 29, is greeted at the Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport in Greer, S.C., with kisses from her dog Dexter and well-wishers holding signs reading \"Welcome Home\" on Monday, Feb. 6, 2017. Zinouri, an Iranian engineer and Clemson University graduate, had been unable to return to the United States because of the executive order President Donald Trump signed that limited travel to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries. (AP Photo/Alex Sanz) The State Department quickly said people from the seven countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — could travel to the U.S. if they had valid visas. The Homeland Security Department said it was no longer directing airlines to prevent affected visa holders from boarding U.S.-bound planes.\nOn Monday in Colorado, a college student who had traveled to Libya with her 1-year-old son to visit her sick mother and attend her father's funeral was back in Fort Collins, welcomed with flowers and balloons by her husband and children. Two Yemeni brothers whose family has sued over the travel ban, and who'd been turned away in the chaotic opening days of the order, arrived at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, where they were greeted by their father.\n\"America is for everybody,\" Aqel Aziz said after greeting his sons.\nSyrian immigrant Mathyo Asali said he thought his life was \"ruined\" when he landed at Philadelphia International Airport on Jan. 28 only to be denied entry to the United States. Asali, who returned to Damascus, said he figured he'd be inducted into the Syrian military. He was back on U.S. soil Monday.\n\"It's really nice to know that there's a lot of people supporting us,\" Asali told Gov. Tom Wolf, who greeted the family at a relative's house in Allentown.\nThe legal fight involves two divergent views of the role of the executive branch and the court system. The government says the president alone has the power to decide who can enter or stay in the United States, while Robart said a judge's job is to ensure that an action taken by the government \"comports with our country's laws.\"\nHis Friday ruling triggered a Twitter rant by Trump, who dismissed Robart as a \"so-called judge.\" On Sunday, Trump tweeted, \"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\"\nStates challenging the ban have been joined by technology companies, who have said it makes it more difficult to recruit employees, and by national security officials under President Barack Obama. A declaration filed by John Kerry and Madeleine Albright, former secretaries of state, and others said the ban would disrupt lives and cripple U.S. counterterrorism partnerships around the world without making the nation safer.\n\"It will aid ISIL's propaganda effort and serve its recruitment message by feeding into the narrative that the United States is at war with Islam,\" they wrote.\nHow and when a case might get to the Supreme Court is unclear. The travel ban itself is to expire in 90 days, meaning it could run its course before a higher court takes up the issue. Or the administration could change it in any number of ways that would keep the issue alive.\nThe bench also could be full, with a new ninth justice on board, by the time the court is ready to hear arguments. If Judge Neil Gorsuch is confirmed this spring as Senate Republicans hope, chances of a tie vote would disappear.\n____\nAssociated Press writers Eugene Johnson and Martha Bellisle in Seattle, Matthew Barakat in Chantilly, Virginia, Michael Rubinkam in Philadelphia, Colleen Slevin in Denver and Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.\nClick to expand Replay Video Senate Democrats to hold floor to protest DeVos nomination Chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel reports from Capitol Hill FOX News Can Trump win the war on poverty?
