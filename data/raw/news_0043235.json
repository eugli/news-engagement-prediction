He said I love Trump. Let Trump do what he has to do. That’s my guy right there.” \nThen, Trump asked his big-time fan to come up to the stage. He told the Secret Service he wasn’t worried about him, so they let him climb over the barricade. \nWhen the fan got to the stage, the president didn’t shake his hand, he hugged him: \nThrowing everyone for a surprise, Trump-style, the Commander-in-Chief then asked the fan, who was shocked to be standing next to him, to say a few words: Trump spots man in the crowd he saw on TV, calls him up, he speaks. \nTrump: “A star is born!” pic.twitter.com/BfzgN4fI3O \n— Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 18, 2017 \nA powerful way to show the people who gave you votes that you care about them.

Greg Miller \nNo president in the history of America has worked so hard to keep his campaign promises, and no president in the history of America has faced the opposition that President Trump is facing while doing it. stevenaquinn \nTrump may be a billionaire and the POTUS but he still connects with the little guy, understands his base’s problems and needs, and intends to fulfill his campaign promises. A voter can’t ask for much more than that. I may die soon given my age but at least I’ll go to my grave seeing a President Hillary Rotten Clinton.
