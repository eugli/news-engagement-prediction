But it is as Ben, a libertarian outdoorsman who’s raising his six children in the forests of the Pacific Northwest, that Viggo Mortensen delivers the performance of his career to date. \nIt is, as the saying goes, the role he was born to play. An excellent athlete at college, a natural leader and a sensitive soul who dabbles in music, poetry and painting, Mortensen grew up on ranches in Venezuela, in the foothills of Argentinian mountains and in the wilds of northern Idaho. Who else would fit free-spirited Ben quite so snugly, whether hunting livestock, inviting feedback on Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita or leading the family in vertiginous rock-climbing? \n“The first time I read the script, I laughed as much as I cried,” Mortensen smiles on the disc’s only extra, a four-minute (!) Making Of, and it’s a fair bet that his emotions were stirred so vigorously due to a strong sense of recognition. Writer/director Matt Ross chips in to reinforce such a view, saying, “Viggo is deeply knowledgeable about living in harmony with the natural environment.” \nSilicon Valley actor Ross, it should be noted, himself grew up in a commune, and penned Captain Fantastic to make sense of a seismic shift in his life: “The genesis was me being a father, grappling with my own questions of what kind of parent you are going to be in the contemporary United States. \nToggling between laughs and anguish and littered with the kind of idiosyncrasies that are so beloved by American indies, Captain Fantastic nonetheless plays straighter and truer than many of the dramedies that come out of Sundance Film Festival, where it debuted last year. \nIn place of character quirks and stylistic twerks is a core of intellectual enquiry and emotional sincerity, as Ben loads the kids onto a battered bus and heads back to so-called civilisation for the funeral of his wife, their mother. She is to be buried, against her wishes, in a Christian service to be held in New Mexico under the stern gaze of her wealthy father Jack (Frank Langella), who threatens Ben with arrest should he show his gaunt, shaggy face at the ceremony. \nEssentially a road trip into consumerist America, Captain Fantastic has the spellbound kids encounter shopping malls and food courts and supermarkets playing panpipe covers of Celine Dion’s ‘My Heart Will Go On’, while Ben points their bows and arrows in the direction of a field of sheep when a diner offers little more than hamburgers, fries and cola (“poison water”). \nA pit stop at the home of Ben’s sister and her hubby (Kathryn Hahn and Steve Zahn), meanwhile, allows Ross the opportunity to verbalise some of his themes. Parenting arguments rage; honesty and open debate clash with social niceties and protective subterfuge; and our bright-eyed, engaged gaggle are sharply contrasted with their bored, petulant cousins who’ve been raised on Xbox. \nBut this is no blind celebration of a neo-hippie doctrine, or else a thudding satire on dumb, selfish, capitalist America. Langella’s grandfather, far from being an oaf or ogre, has the children’s interests at heart, and it transpires that Ben and his late wife may not have been singing entirely from the same hymn sheet. There’s also the suggestion that had her illness been monitored rather than tucked away in the forest, she might still be alive. \nAfter a relatively light, larky first half, tensions begin to bubble, discontent escalates and sympathies start to shift. Ben’s parenting philosophy suddenly seems not so much eccentric and anti-establishment as questionable and downright irresponsible – not least when he gifts his kids Ka-Bar fighting knives for Noam Chomsky Day (his substitute for Christmas). Is he a counterculture hero or an oppressive cult leader? \nThe truth, naturally, is somewhere in between, with Captain Fantastic acknowledging the importance of tolerance while leaning towards the need for America to change. It’s a worldview that chimes with Mortensen’s own politics (“I think most Americans will look back on this period since 1980 as morally bleak, intellectually fraudulent…” he said in a 2005 interview), and it makes for heartening viewing as Trump settles into the Oval Office. \nIt’s not for nothing that the camera lingers on a billboard reading ‘Is it immigration or invasion?’ when the family’s bus first motors out of the pine trees and onto a freeway. Captain Fantastic encourages debate, and with it the road to a better future. \nEXTRAS: Making Of \nDirector: Matt Ross; Starring: Viggo Mortensen, George MacKay, Samantha Isler; DVD, BD, Digital HD release: January 23, 2017 \nJamie Graham ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:23:32.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
