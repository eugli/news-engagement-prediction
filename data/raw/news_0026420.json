After their goal I saw only one team, to be honest. We played well, created good chances, played good football, but didn’t score, and that was the difference between the two teams. One team created three chances and they scored three. We created five or six and scored none.”\nZola said he would not criticise his team and was encouraged by much of what he saw. “This is one of the best games they have played since I have been at the club,” he said. “I believe in this team and I believe in myself. I continue working because I like working for this club and I’m going to give everything I have got.”\nSheffield Wednesday, who strengthened their sixth place with the win, opened the scoring in the ninth minute through Jordan Rhodes, who headed in from a Ross Wallace free-kick. Birmingham had much of the game thereafter but Sam Winnall all but ended the contest in the 80th minute with a close-range diving header and Adam Reach added a late third.\nThe goals by Rhodes and Winnall, who both signed in the latest transfer window, were their first for the club and Wednesday’s manager, Carlos Carvalhal, said he had been encouraged by the way they had played on their first start together. “It’s not the perfect understanding yet but they are doing well and there are good signals,” he said. “It’s a new dynamic that we’ve got to work and I believe they will get better and better.”\nCarvalhal acknowledged that the scoreline possibly flattered Wednesday but said he was just relieved to have got the victory. “At 1-0 we relaxed a little and that is a dangerous score. Birmingham came into the game and a few games last season we struggled in games like that. It’s a heavy scoreline for Birmingham but we deserved the win because we scored the three goals.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:35:52.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
