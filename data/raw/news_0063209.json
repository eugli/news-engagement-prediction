But on this occasion it's for Dani Alves who clearly wished he'd never left Barcelona. \nFor years the partnership down Barcelona's right hand side of Lionel Messi and the man who broke the false advertising laws every time someone referred to him as a 'defender' scared the defences of everyone in La Liga. \nAlves moved to the Camp Nou in 2008 from Sevilla. He'd already won the Copa del Rey and two Sevilla Cups, or UEFA Cups to give them their actual name, by the time he joined the European giants, where he went on to win six La Liga titles and three Champions League medals too. \nHowever last summer he decided against signing a new contract and instead moved to Italy to play for Serie A champions Juventus. However according to Mundo Deportivo he is struggling in Italy and offered himself to Barca in January. \nThe report goes on to say that the Brazilian was told by the club that his time there had come to an end and was also met with a passive aggressive reminder that it was him who decided to end his time there. \nAlves apparently called to ask to come back in November just before the wing back broke his leg in the surprise 3-1 defeat to Genoa, which would have put the final nail in the coffin of any idea of him returning. \nThe 33 year old has failed to reignite the spark he had in Spain but he did score in the Champions League last night as the Old Lady won their first leg 2-0 against Porto. \nWatch Neymar scoring stunning goals in Barcelona training: \n(Credit: FC Barcelona) \nOf course the ridiculous thing is that Luis Enrique's team are in desperate need of a right back with only Alex Vidal and Sergi Roberto available to play in the position. \nAlves' children are still living in Spain with their mother so it would be no surprise to see him back in Spain next season, even if it's not with Barcelona. \nShould the club have taken him back?
