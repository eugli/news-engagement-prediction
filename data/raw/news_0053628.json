Let cool. Frozen Treats Photo by Claire Lower. \nDuring my last attempt to be a somewhat healthy grownup, my King Charles Spaniel became obsessed with my morning smoothie . At first I just let her lick my empty glass, but was soon making a little extra so she could have her own, spaniel-sized portion in her bowl. Unsurprisingly, her favorite was the one with peanut butter in it. Peanut Butter and Jelly Smoothie \nIngredients: 5 ounces of nonfat Greek yogurt (I used one of the single-serving Chobani 0% yogurts) 2 heaping tablespoons of peanut butter 8 small strawberries (use frozen for a frosty treat) A tablespoon of maple syrup (any grade is fine, but grade B is more flavorful) \nPut it all in a blender and blend until it’s a smoothie. I’m pretty confident you know what a smoothie looks like. Pour a small portion into your pups bowl and either refrigerated the rest or drink it yourself. Strawberry Ice Cream \nYou may or may not have seen a little product called “Frosty Paws,” but it is essentially overpriced dog ice cream that my pooch is crazy for. (She’s also crazy for a pizza grease-soaked paper towel, so let’s not put too much stock in her palate.) Unlike children, dogs are completely unaware of branding, and they will be just as happy with the ice cream-like concoction you create. (Which is great, because those Frosty Paw things are expensive.) Advertisement \nIngredients: 4 large strawberries, rinsed, hulled, and diced 3 cups of nonfat plain yogurt, divided in half; avoid brands that contain any fat substitutes \nCombine both ingredients in a blender or food processor. Transfer mixture to little cups or an ice cube tray and freeze. If you want to pipe the mixture into fun little shapes, pour the mixture into a piping bag or resealable plastic bag with a corner snipped off. Line a baking tray or cutting board with wax paper and pipe whatever shapes you artistically capable of onto the paper. (I can do circles and hearts.) Pop the tray or board in your freezer until the shapes are fully set (about fifteen minutes). Peel them off the paper and serve to your favorite pupper. (Store in an airtight container in the freezer.) Meaty Munchies Photo by Karen . \nThough the pet food marketing would have us believe that dogs are ruled by their desire for bacon, that particular pork product should be largely avoided as a treat, due to high levels of salt and fat. (Even bacon of the highest quality isn’t fit for canine consumption.) For a healthy, but still vastly appealing porcine snack, swap out the cured breakfast meat for simply-cooked pig ears for a chewy treat. Baked Pig Ears \nI love a fried pig ear, but deep-frying is not a good cooking method for dog treats. Instead of dipping them in a vat of hot oil, Food52 recommends baking these babies slow and low in the oven. (Alternatively, you can smoke them. Food52 can walk you through the process here .) Advertisement Pig ears Oil \nObtain some pig ears from your butcher or nearest Piggly Wiggly (if you happen to live near such a fine establishment). Cut them into pieces that are appropriately sized for your doggo (they shrink a bit during cooking), then toss them with just enough oil to coat. Spread them out on a baking sheet lined with foil and bake on your oven’s lowest setting until they are completely dried out. Depending on how low your oven can go, this will take anywhere from 6-10 hours, so flip them around the four hour mark. Once they’re nice and crispy, let them cool, and store in a paper bag in a cool, dry place. Go Raw Photo by Vitamina Verde . \nDogs like food, and frankly they don’t care how much time you spend preparing it. That’s great news, because there’s not always time to bake (or blend) for your pooch, but you can still reward him or her for being such a good boy or girl with some tasty raw snacks: Advertisement Carrot sticks —Dogs don’t even need dip. Apples slices —Remove the seeds and core first. Pineapple chunks —Make sure to peel off every bit of that spiny skin. Blueberries —Freeze ‘em for a chilly summertime treat. Cucumbers —Cucumbers are mostly water, making them super hydrating and appropriate for pets that might be on calorie-restricted diets \nThose are my dog’s personal favorites, but you can check out this list from the American Kennel Club for more ideas. If you have any doubt as to whether or not something is okay for your dog to eat consult your veterinarian, and always avoid onions (or anything in the onion family), grapes, mushrooms, avocado, and tomatoes.
