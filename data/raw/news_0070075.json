I need to dress the way he did, and as long as I'm playing him, I need to live my life the way he did. Alone. Writing words that created magic on paper.\" Nandita Das Nawaz as Manto. \nThe actor also revealed that he intends to refurnish his room in the same manner as Manto's. This includes replacing the type of bed he currently sleeps on. \n\"If I enter Manto's physical world, I feel I can penetrate his mind,\" he said. \nWhile actors are known to juggle a couple of projects, Nawaz intends to steer clear of shooting any other film until Manto is completed. \nThe actor did something similar during the filming of Anurag Kashyap's Raman Raghav 2.0 . The process took such a toll on him that he was rushed to the hospital a couple of times. He would also end up talking in his sleep, something that sent his wife in a state of panic. \nNawaz, in a conversation with this writer, later revealed that he had to go back to his village in Uttar Pradesh and live with his extended family to finally come in a state of complete normalcy. \nAlso see on HuffPost:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:27:38.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
