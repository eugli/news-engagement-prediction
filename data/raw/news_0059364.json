I also know that I wouldn't still be living here if this were truly the case. \nEvery morning, I take my three young children to their local public schools, where kids of every color and creed come together in the spirit of liberté, égalité, and fraternité to learn French and math and history. Parents mingle outside and often grab coffee together at the corner café before heading to work. We talk about kids, politics, pollution, cinema, and the devastating effects of war on families, so many of whom have come to Europe seeking a safer life for their own children. \nWalking around our neighborhood, we often see a group of four commandos patrolling the streets in full combat gear. They've become a regular sight since 2015 — we live a block from one of the cafés targeted in the November attacks — and, more than anything, they remind us that the world is a different place than it was even 10 years ago. Their presence felt foreboding at first; now it feels reassuring. I usually greet them with a “bonjour” and thank them for their service. Like you, I take my family's wellness and security very seriously. \nOn the weekend, my husband and I run the kids around to all of their usual activities, and try to get to a museum or to one of the city's beautiful parks. We often talk about what it would be like to move back to the States but agree that it would be hard to give up the bilingual, bi-cultural life our children have made their own. \nI grew up in New England and moved to Paris two decades ago, probably for many of the same reasons you visited every summer with your family. What's not to love? Baguettes, cheese, wine, French, the French, art, architecture, fashion … did I mention the baguettes? Toss me your best overused stereotype of French \"je ne sais quoi\" and I can assure you that each one still has a proud place in daily life here. \nSure, the Paris I met 20 years ago has evolved but, then, so has life on Earth. Who could have imagined back in 1996 that \"Paris par Arrondissements,\" the ubiquitous little red book of maps, would be made obsolete by the iPhone? \nOther things, too, have changed since the end of the last century. The Marais went from a sleepy little neighborhood of mom-and-pop stores to a bustling fashion and design destination, neo-bistros have added new layers of complexity to the identity of French cuisine, the city's buses have ditched diesel … the list goes on and on. \nBut Paris is still the grande dame now that she was then. You can still meander along the banks of Ile Saint Louis with a Berthillon ice cream in hand, or spend the afternoon window-shopping in Saint-Germain des Prés. And there's nothing like a stroll through the Tuileries gardens, even on a rainy day. \nSo, please come back for a visit and let me know when you're in town. The Paris you love is still here. The Eiffel Tower stands in all of her glory, and you'll still have to line up with the other tourists to get to the top. Restaurants and cafés are still filled to capacity for lunch and dinner, so you might need a reservation, and people still sit outside on sidewalk terraces at the first sight of sun. I'll even save you a seat. \nWe'll always have Paris and, Jim, I hope you will too. \nSincerely, \nKaess Christensen, a New England native, has lived in Paris for the past 20 years.
