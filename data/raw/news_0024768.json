Spotify and AccuWeather have joined forces to launch a new site called Climatune , which creates playlists based on weather and listening data. Information was compiled during a yearlong study that compared 85 billion anonymized streams on Spotify in over 900 cities. The platform draws conclusions based on the weather in specific cities, tracking listening patterns during various forecasts. Learn more about the study behind service here , and check out Climatune here . \nA quick scan of the service yielded some interesting results. A playlist for rainy days in Detroit, instead of Danny Brown , offers “Sk8r Boi” and “Bittersweet Symphony.” On a cloudy São Paulo day, Climatune recommended Johnny Cash’s “Hurt.” Snowy Copenhagen’s playlist features five different David Bowie songs. When it’s sunny in Houston, it’s P.O.D., Drowning Pool, and Incubus. A windy day in Perth calls for Charli XCX’s “Boom Clap,” Gorillaz’s “Feel Good Inc.,” and a song from Hans Zimmer’s Inception score. Listen to the perfect song for all weather scenarios below. \nRead Pitchfork’s feature “ The Year in Streaming 2016 .” Tags In This Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:07:33.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
