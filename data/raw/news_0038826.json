Instagram @bymariandrew Scrolling through Instagram this weekend, I expected to find the following: Photos of fancy lattes, an envy-inducing pic of someone on a white sand beach, and some sort of food video that I would watch for way too long. What I didn't expect to find: an Instagram that perfectly summed up my experience with grief . But there it was, situated in my feed right next to pics of Insta-famous goldendoodles and tasty # ats. The Instagram came from writer and illustrator Mari Andrew . It's a hand-drawn image, and it shows three different bags in decreasing size—a huge burlap sack, a briefcase, and a small purse. Written on each bag is the word \"grief.\" Her caption for the image laid bare her own experience with grief. \"My dad died two years ago today,\" Andrew wrote. \"It's different for everyone, but my personal experience is that grief doesn't ever go away, but it does change shape and it becomes something you can hold rather than something that overwhelms you—a part of you, rather than a burden.\" After seeing the image and reading her caption, I instantly felt a wave of relief wash over me. With her words and her art, Andrew perfectly summed up what I'd been experiencing for the past two years as I grieved the loss of my dad. My dad was the first person close to me to pass away, and it happened when I was just 22 years old, fresh out of college and thrown into this thing called the real world. I didn't know what grief was—and it kicked down my door right away. When I first started grieving, it felt unbearably overwhelming, like a giant 50-pound sack sitting on my shoulders. Most days, I woke up noticing this heaviness inside me, wondering if it would ever go away and crying at the thought that I truly didn't think it could. I cried for the me before my dad passed away, the me who didn't know what it was like to walk around with her heart and stomach constantly twisted into knots. She didn't know how good she had it, I thought. But, as Andrew's Instagram shows, my grief did start to change. With the help of time and a really good therapist , that weight on my shoulders lightened a bit, turning from that 50-pound sack to more of a really heavy tote bag. My grief still existed, but it didn't overcome me as much. And sometimes, it could go unnoticed. Today, I think I'm at the purse stage in Andrew's progression. My grief has become more manageable, less overwhelming, and more a part of me rather than something dumped upon me. It's light enough to wear around all the time, and most days I forget it's even there. Other days, however, the purse feels like someone put a brick in it. But that's the biggest lesson I've learned about grief: It will probably never fully go away, but I can handle it. I'll always have days when it hits me with all it has, wringing out my heart yet again. But knowing that I can live with my grief and that I'm strong enough to \"carry it\" gives me confidence. And I know my confidence in the face of this loss would make my dad proud. Grief is different for everyone, and maybe Andrew's Instagram doesn't speak to you like it did to me. But I want to thank Mari Andrew for shining light on her experience, which helped me understand something I've tried to make sense of for a long time. The over 40,000 likes and thousands of comments on her photo show me that I'm not alone in this. Grief doesn't discriminate—it affects people of all ages from all walks of life. And I truly believe the more we talk about it, the better we can understand ourselves and learn how to best move forward. I know that's what's helped me.
