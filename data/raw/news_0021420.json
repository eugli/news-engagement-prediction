(Andrew Harnik/AP) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  57 PM \nSAN DIEGO — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told law enforcement officials on a tour of nation's border with Mexico Friday that he couldn't define a sanctuary city, which President Trump has targeted for withdrawal of federal funding for refusing to cooperate with immigration authorities. \nTrump's executive order on immigration last month says a \"sanctuary jurisdiction\" defies federal law by shielding people in the country illegally and that they have caused \"immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic.\" \nWhile sanctuary cities are broadly understood to mean a refusal to cooperate with the federal government on immigration enforcement, a precise definition has eluded many, including in law enforcement. \n\"I don't have a clue,\" Kelly told San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman when she asked for a definition. \nThe blunt-spoken, retired four-star general went on to say it was inconceivable why any jurisdiction wouldn't want criminals removed from their communities. \"I'm stunned when people say, 'Well, we're not going to cooperate with you even in the event of convicted criminals,\" he said. \nKelly said it would be difficult to justify immigration enforcement grants to cities that refuse to cooperate.

In San Diego, he joined agents on two house visits to deport people in the country illegally and toured a cross-border drug tunnel. Last week he toured the border in south Texas. \nThe secretary said he got \"an earful\" of suggestions from his employees on where to extend a border wall with Mexico, which currently covers about 700 miles of the 2,000-mile international divide. \n\"I'll take that on board, we'll bring it back to Washington, put in the blender and come up with a solution,\" he told federal, state and local law enforcement officials at San Diego's San Ysidro port of entry, the nation's busiest border crossing. \nOn Tuesday, Kelly told lawmakers that he would like to see wall construction \"well underway\" within two years, but he held open the possibility that it wouldn't extend to areas where there are natural physical barriers.

He said vetting practices in those countries \"are loose at best\" and that the countries include failing or faltering states. \n\"I am concerned in that we are unable to vet these folks who are coming here in a more meaningful way,\" he said. \nAsked about reports from advocacy groups that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents did a large roundup of people in the country illegally in Southern California and made arrests elsewhere, Kelly said authorities are executing the law. He didn't specifically address the reports but rejected the term 'roundup' and said officials cannot ignore federal laws. He said Congress should change the law if it sees fit. \nAt the meeting with law enforcement officials, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore sought help for legal authority to hold criminals in the country illegally after they finish their sentences, giving ICE authorities more time to pick them up at county jails. Kelly said he didn't know if that was possible but would do so if he could.
