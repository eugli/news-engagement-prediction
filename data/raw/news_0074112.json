Keep smiling! Mourinho of all people melts hearts with touching message to Ranieri \nWenger himself has remained coy over his future, although the Frenchman insisted he would still be a manager next season. \nAnd the 67-year-old at least has the backing of star defender Laurent Koscielny, who says Wenger was vital to his development as a player. \nHe told RMC: ‘I want Arsene Wenger to continue [as Arsenal manager]. \n‘I have been under his command for seven years, and I am very respected by him. \n‘He gave me that chance to come here. He made me grow as a player and as a man. I owe him a lot for my career. Wenger could leave Arsenal at the end of the season (Picture: Getty) \nKoscielny, who has made over 200 appearances for the Gunners since 2010, added: ‘I think the group is always receptive to Wenger’s message. \n‘The coach is there to prepare the players physically, tactically and put an organisation on the ground, after it is up to the players to do what is needed on the pitch to win the matches.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:34:53.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
