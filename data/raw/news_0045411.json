Fahrenthold, Karen DeYoung) \nFor President Jimmy Carter, Camp David's seclusion and privacy was a major factor in the peace deal he struck there in 1978 between Egypt and Israel. Without the news media around, there were few leaks and no television cameras to posture in front of. Also, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat wasn't an outdoorsy guy. \n\"He did not like being left out there in the woods,\" said William Quandt, a member of Carter's National Security Council and a key figure in what became known as the Camp David Accords. \"The claustrophobic feeling there really helped the negotiations. They had to get a deal.\" \nPresident George H.W. Bush hosted Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev for a round of summit talks, played tennis and zipped around in golf carts. President Bill Clinton hosted a failed summit between Israeli and Palestinian leaders in 2000. President George W. Bush decamped there 149 times, according to statistics kept by CBS News reporter Mark Knoller. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Bush was photographed there with his national security team wearing a fleece naval jacket while looking over maps of Afghanistan. \nAs history goes, President Barack Obama 's use of Camp David could mark a turning point. Although he hosted a Group of Eight summit there, Obama visited the retreat just 39 times. If future presidents skew like Obama or Trump - younger and urbane, or older and rich - Camp David could be used less and less. \n\"It's so rustic and remote that people used to staying at the Four Seasons really don't find comfort there,\" Brinkley said. \"Obama had Hawaii and Chicago. He liked golf resorts. Trump has Mar-a-Lago. It simply becomes just a property of the U.S. government.\" \nQuandt, the Carter administration official, said the country doesn't need a place such as Camp David to strike major diplomatic deals. Obama reached major accords with Iraq and Cuba without sequestering those country's leaders in the woods. \n\"There's nothing really magical there about the place, per se,\" he said. \"It's about, do you have the wherewithal? It's not necessarily about where it happens.\" CAMP-DAVID Michael S. Williamson / The Washington Post \nThe Catoctin Mountain Park (where Camp David is located) can be seen, at left, from downtown Thurmont. It's common when one asks a local where Camp David is located they just point to the hills and say, \"Up there.\" \nThe Catoctin Mountain Park (where Camp David is located) can be seen, at left, from downtown Thurmont. It's common when one asks a local where Camp David is located they just point to the hills and say, \"Up there.\" (Michael S. Williamson / The Washington Post) \nBut Quandt said it would be concerning if Trump's ostentatious properties become the backdrop for major diplomatic deals or a global symbol of American leisure. \"Camp David is more modest and more in line with what ordinary Americans identify with,\" he said. \"A lot of us can imagine going to a place like Camp David, a vacation in the mountains. A lot us cannot imagine going to Mar-a-Lago.\" \nBut maybe those \"ordinary Americans\" can. \nThurmont is Trump Country - conservative, staunchly Republican, American-made. Trump banners still hang on the sides of barns. Local restaurants sell Trump memorabilia. On the way to Camp David, there is a house with a Confederate battle flag flying out front. \nSo far, Trump can do no wrong in the eyes of voters here - including taking a pass on vacationing near them, giving up the chance to glimpse life in a town, even from a helicopter, where residents voted for him to make America great again. \n\"It doesn't mean anything if he doesn't come,\" said Michael Hobbs, co-owner of Hobbs Hardware on East Main Street, a store that's been around since 1942. \"It's an outdoor lifestyle there. People relate to different things. That's okay.\" \nHobbs also stipulated that if he had a couple billion dollars, \"I wouldn't be up in the woods, either.\" \nIn some ways, not taking offense mirrors some of the cognitive dissonance that unfolded during Trump's campaign, when he appealed to voters in towns like Thurmont with a populist, workingman message, even if it was delivered by a candidate given to decorating his residences in gold. \n\"I don't think there's some kind of disconnect if he doesn't come here,\" Thurmont Mayor John Kinnaird said. \"I don't take that as some kind of brushoff.\" \nAsking about Trump's election rival Hillary Clinton, in almost any fashion, draws a somewhat critical response or laughter from many around town before a quick patriotic course correction in rhetoric. \n\"I think people would resent it if she came up,\" said longtime Frederick County (Maryland) Sheriff Chuck Jenkins, who trounced a Democrat who challenged him three years ago. \"But to be honest, we treat anyone who goes there with respect. It doesn't matter.\" \nEven as Trump made the third trip of his presidency to Mar-a-Lago over the holiday weekend, residents and town officials refuse to concede that Trump will pass them by. \nSoon enough, they say, he will want to take a quick helicopter ride to escape the White House and walk in the woods with Melania. \nHe will have a financial reason to show up - the mounting security bills at his other getaways. \nThey even compare him (quietly) to President John F. Kennedy, noting that the young president and his wife, Jacqueline, initially preferred Camelot's other locales before coming to savor the nearby tranquility of the cabins in the woods. \n\"He's going to figure out it's a great getaway,\" Jenkins said. \"It's a mountaintop retreat - walking paths, in a wooded area, totally peaceful. It's unbelievable. If I was in the White House, that would be my White House.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:37:22.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
