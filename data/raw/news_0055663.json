What is the basis of U.S. opposition to this Treaty for the Rights of Women? \nBacked by Three Presidents Often referred to as an international bill of rights for women, CEDAW was adopted by the United Nations in 1979. President Jimmy Carter signed the treaty guaranteeing gender equity within its first year. But the Senate has never ratified CEDAW, and without ratification the U.S. is not bound by its provisions. \nIn addition to Carter, two other presidents have attempted to push forward CEDAW. Urged by the Clinton administration in 1994, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on CEDAW and recommended it be ratified. Yet Senator Jesse Helms, a leading conservative and longtime CEDAW opponent, prevented a vote in the Senate. \nIn the early years of his administration, President George W. Bush looked favorably on ratification of CEDAW but later changed his position. In 2002, although the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 12-7 to approve the treaty, it was never sent to the full Senate for advice and consent to ratification. \nOpposed by Conservatives and the Religious Right Over a hundred organizations support ratification of CEDAW including Amnesty International, the League of Women Voters, and AARP. \nThe main opposition comes from conservative groups and the religious right who are concerned that CEDAW will challenge the laws and culture of the U.S. \nIn arguments against CEDAW, the conservative organization Concerned Women for America cite that ratification of the treaty will: negate family law and undermine traditional family values by redefining the family force the U.S. to pay men and women the same for \"work of equal value\" thus going against our free-market system ensure access to abortion services and contraception create a possible 'back door' ERA for feminists allow same-sex marriage", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:55:44.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
