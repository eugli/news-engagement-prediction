Speaking to Metro.co.uk at a recent event, he enthused: ‘You’d have to be a robot not to feel some sort of pressure from the Robron fans. They are so passionate and so loyal. They will hunt me down and beat me to death if we didn’t pay off what they wanted! (Picture: ITV) \n‘Part of good drama is to understand want the audience wants and make them wait for it and not necessarily give them the easiest route from A to B. Robert and Aaron have survived a hell of a lot of challenges over the years and it will continue to be like that. But I think ultimately whatever happens, I feel that they are the love of each others’s lives. \n‘Whatever else might happen, the long term destination will eventually see them coming back together whatever they go through. I do feel a certain amount of pressure form the Robron fans. You don’t meet fans that are that passionate that often. I don’t engage on social media – I survey it from behind a curtain!’ \nAnd he continues to be impressed with the devotion and level of analysis from the viewers, adding: ‘I do receive a lot of letters from fans and it’s all so insightful and well thought out and some of these people are well qualified for a career in television in the future if they ever wanted to take that path. (Picture: ITV) \n‘Some of these people are 13 and 14 – they are way more coherent than I ever was at that age. It’s an incredible thing to behold. The peak letter time from fans was when I first started – maybe they thought “if we get him now, then we can nobble him before things get out of hand!”’ All the press event gossip! \nIn case you missed any, here are links to all of the articles from the Emmerdale press event. \nFirst details of Chas’ exit revealed ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:40:20.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
