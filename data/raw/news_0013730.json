Was. Insane. \nWhen speaking to press after the big game, which just so happened to be in his hometown of Houston , Bennett reiterated his sentiment that he would NOT visit the White House following his team's victory because he doesn't \"support the person in it.\" \nOh, and not only that, but he totally doesn't care what New England team owner Robert Kraft thinks about it! \nSucks to suck, Donald Trump ! Hope you and Tom Brady have fun! \nNot only did Marty answer the political questions with class — he also spread a message of acceptance and inclusion (and his daughter Jett Rose totally stole the spotlight). \nWatch what the footballer had to say (below)! \nMartellus Bennett says he won't go to the White House with the #Patriots https://t.co/r2ee8pHJ4r #SuperBowl pic.twitter.com/oWr7tVgZwk — USA TODAY Sports (@USATODAYsports) February 6, 2017 \nIn case that wasn't enough for you to fall in love with Bennett, here's some more evidence for your obviously cold heart (below) — starting with more Jett Rose, of course! \n1. Jett talking about her puppy Wendy , who is a very \"bad girl\" during last night's press conference: \n. @MartysaurusRex 's adorable daughter stole the show with this funny moment in the postgame press conference. pic.twitter.com/Od0KMzLqme", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T19:44:02.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
