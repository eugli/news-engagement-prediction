Remodeling of Missouri's lieutenant governor's office tops $50,000 By Kurt Erickson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Feb 24, 2017 \nA sign marking the lieutenant governor's office. TownNews.com Content Exchange \nJEFFERSON CITY • Missouri’s No. 2 statewide official has approved more than $54,000 in remodeling and renovation to his office since he won the November election. \nAs the governor was cutting spending on a variety of programs because of a slowdown in revenue, Lt. Gov. Mike Parson charged taxpayers $8,474 to replace furniture in his new office on the second floor of the Capitol. \nThat’s in addition to the more than $46,000 spent upgrading his suite of offices in the wake of former Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder’s departure. \nThe remodeling and redecorating costs were obtained by the Post-Dispatch after Parson, a former state senator from Bolivar, announced he was seeking an increase of nearly 25 percent in his operating budget in order to pay for mileage, out-of-state travel expenses and for an additional employee. \nThat request comes as Gov. Eric Greitens and lawmakers are reviewing a $27.6 billion spending plan for the coming fiscal year that reduces funding for higher education and could reduce health care to 20,000 elderly and disabled Missourians. \nAnd it comes after Greitens and his predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, pared $200 million in spending in the current budget because tax revenues aren’t growing as quickly as projected. \nParson spokesman Tyler Habiger defended the office work, saying it hadn’t been updated during Kinder’s tenure. \n“It should be noted that there has been no refurbishment work done on the lieutenant governor’s office in at least 12 years,” Habiger told the Post-Dispatch. \nAccording to the Office of Administration, which oversees maintenance and operations in the Capitol complex, the work in Parson’s office included the replacement of damaged hardwood flooring and repair of cracked plaster in the walls. \nWorkers also removed old wiring, replaced old carpeting and cabinets and installed a new sink and refrigerator in the office’s kitchen. \nThe new furniture includes a leather couch in the waiting room. \nAlthough there was turnover in five of the six statewide offices in November, only the lieutenant governor had work done to his office during the transition period, said Office of Administration spokeswoman Ryan Burns. \nThe lieutenant governor, with a salary of about $86,600, is the lowest-paid of Missouri’s statewide elected officials and has the smallest staff. \nParson is seeking a $125,000 increase in his $463,000 annual budget. Of that, he wants $35,000 in his budget for travel expenses, including money to reimburse him for mileage when he drives his personal vehicle on state business. \nHe also is seeking $10,000 for out-of-state travel. Parson told members of a House budget committee it could be used to pay for trips to meet with other lieutenant governors. \nDuring his tenure, Kinder also asked for taxpayers to pick up his mileage costs, but he also reduced spending in his office to offset the additional expense. His requests were turned down. \n​ Kurt Erickson • 573-556-6181", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T16:46:23.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
