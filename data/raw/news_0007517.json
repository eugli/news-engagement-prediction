There’s a 9-foot cable (it’s not wireless) and offers vibration feedback. \nThe Hyperkin X91 is released on February 21 and is now available for pre-order and is available in white, red and black. \nMicrosoft also outed a pair of new colour options for the official Xbox One Wireless Controllers, which will be released early this month . \nThey’re named Ocean Shadow and Winter Forces . We’re all in on the Ocean Shadow version, which starts off as with a matte black top that fades into metallic blue. \nThe Winter Forces version, with its patchy camouflage look, is a little less attractive. \nWhat do you think? Are you looking for a less hefty Xbox One pad?   below.
