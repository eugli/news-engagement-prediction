This time, he spoke about his special Valentine. No surprises for guessing! It's none other than his dear granddaughter Aaradhya Bachchan . While the whole world was out and about celebrating Valentine's Day , the doting grandpa celebrated the day with Aaradhya . \n\nAmitabh Bachchan on retirement: Thank you… But no thank you Even at 74, Amitabh Bachchan is in no mood to hang up his boots. \nThe proud grandfather wrote, on his blog, how Aaradhya brought the whole Bachchan clan together for Valentine's Day. It started with her wanting to go out with the family to an Italian restaurant for some pizza. The toddler later politely thanked the waitress for the pizza and even wished her \"Happy Valentine's Day!\" Once back home, when she was asked to thank her grandpa for taking her out for dinner, Aaradhya promptly replied saying, she should be thanked instead as it was her idea to bring the whole family together. Isn't she a cutie?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:51:23.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
