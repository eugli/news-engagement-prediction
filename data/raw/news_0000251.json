He pointed to a lack of new injection sites established since stringent criteria were established under the previous Conservative government. \nIn January 2016, the Dr. Peter Centre in B.C. — a site in operation since 2002 because law enforcement turned a blind eye— received an exemption required under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to sanction its activities. \nREAD MORE: More Canadian babies born with opioid addiction and withdrawal \nInsite in Vancouver also received an exemption in the spring allowing it to continue operations for another four years. \n“Bottom line is: I don’t think we should be sitting around debating while people are dying and when we know we can take action immediately,” Davies said. \nHealth officials and political leaders across the country have sounded the alarm about the rise in opioid deaths — a national crisis that was the subject of a summit in Ottawa last fall. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:11:51.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
