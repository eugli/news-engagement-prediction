We do not forgive. We do not forget. You should have expected us.” The message noted that the operation was “surprisingly easy.” \nOn top of the message, the hacker demanded 1 Bitcoin (valued at $100) to return stolen data – allegedly effecting 400,000 users although it is not clear if this is a serious demand or not. \nThe hacker says that he just wanted to access Freedom Hosting initially but on realising how much child pornography was available he decided to shut it down. \nA previous hack by Anonymous in 2011 infiltrated around 40 child porn sites and published names of users resulting in law enforcement agencies getting involved. A further hack took place in 2014 which the group called Operation Death Eaters. \nThe group has also recently threatened President Trump claiming he will “regret the next four years.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T07:35:39.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
