Cracker mate, that's a beaut, ripper idea. We worked on that one for ages, just to unsettle a side that has trampled us once in the last 10 tests. \nContrite is the word I'd use about us wasting six months of Australian police time, when they probably had their hands full investigating the misdeeds of rugby league players. \nWe regret the bugging information was made public on match day, just as Michael Cheika was putting the final touches on his game plan. If he was in any way upset with the 42-8 loss, we are almost inconsolable. \nFurther, we Kiwis are full of remorse we are such slow learners in the dark art of sporting subterfuge. Other countries have been good at that for a long, long, time. Ad Feedback \nWe can recall one country in the 1980s rolling a cricket ball along the ground to win a one-day game, and a few years later their wicketkeeper prodding off the bails to make it look as if Black Cap Neil Broom had been bowled. \nIt's such a coincidence that this bugging thing should pop up in Sydney, it's simply so unlucky for the lucky country that the other rugby spying scandal we can recall took place in Oz as well. \nThat one involved the English coach Eddie Jones, who was coaching the Wallabies, being accused of spying on the Springboks in 2001. He denied it. \nAnd while we are wallowing in sackcloth, ashes and gumboots we may as well take the blame for The Daily Mail in England publishing a photo of the Wallaby tactics ahead of the 2015 World Cup final. \nYou might recall those tactics - one of the things on the list was All Blacks No 12 Ma'a Nonu steps back on the inside when he's against good line speed. \nJust after halftime Nonu stepped back inside and ran almost 50 metres to score a crucial try, opening up a 21-3 lead. Sorry about that. Too much information, I guess. \nSo we hope you our Anzac comrades will accept this letter in the spirit it is intended. \nWe hope to put this incident behind us, so you can go back to eating pavlova, listening to Crowded House while admiring that portrait of Phar Lap hanging by the fly screen. \nNo worries. Sweet as. Enjoy Anzac Day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:45:32.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
