Mr. Reed, who took office in 2010, added: “Day in and day out I have poured myself into this job. I wanted to be mayor of Atlanta since I was 13. And you think that I would throw my life away for some short-term gratification?” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The brick and the rodents at Mr. Mitchell’s home were detailed in a police report on Sept. 11, 2015. In it, officers responding to a damage-to-property call said that Mr. Mitchell told them the incident had to do with “a federal case.” He also told them that he was going to contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which he said would be investigating. In January, Mr. Mitchell, 63, the owner of several Atlanta-area construction companies, was arraigned on conspiratorial bribery and money laundering charges of paying more than $1 million to win city contracts. As part of a guilty plea, Mr. Mitchell agreed to cooperate with federal investigators. On Feb. 8, the second contractor, Charles P. Richards Jr., 64, was arraigned on charges of paying $185,000 in bribes. The authorities said Mr. Richards conspired with Mr. Mitchell in the pay-to-play scheme from 2010 to August 2015. Last week, Mr. Richards also pleaded guilty in federal court and is cooperating with investigators. In both cases, the authorities said, the men gave money to an unidentified individual on the belief that it would get them city contracts. “It’s a big deal,” said Angelo Fuster, a longtime political consultant who worked for three of Atlanta’s mayors. “And the mechanics of it, the way that this seems to have been developing since — what is it, 2010? — is very unusual.” City contracting here has long been both a source of civic pride and lingering suspicion. After his election in 1974, the city’s first African-American mayor, Maynard Jackson, sought to combat decades of economic injustice by increasing minority participation in city contracts to more than 35 percent from less than 1 percent. But high-profile contracting scandals have also resulted in prison terms for several Atlanta politicians and business executives. In 2006, a five-year federal investigation of William C. Campbell, a former mayor who served from 1994 to 2002, ended with a jury finding him not guilty of charges of bribery and racketeering. He was, however, found guilty of tax evasion and sentenced to 30 months in prison. The targets of the previous investigations were a multicultural group, as are those involved in the current scandal: Mr. Mitchell is black, and Mr. Richards is white.

A message scrawled on it said: “ER keep your mouth shut!!! Shut up.” Credit Atlanta Police Department It is unclear where the evidence will lead, but court documents suggest that investigators have been paying attention to a woman named Mitzi Bickers, a pastor, political consultant and former president of the Atlanta school board. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In January, soon after Mr. Mitchell’s arraignment, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on the threatening attack on his home. In November, the Atlanta police arrested a man named Shandarrick Barnes in the incident. He has been charged with terroristic threats and criminal damage to property. State records show that Mr. Barnes had business ties with Ms. Bickers, who worked on Mr. Reed’s election campaign and in the city’s human services department from 2010 to 2013.
