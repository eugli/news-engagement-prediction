At the time, doctors told Lopez's family that he might not make it, let alone be ever able to walk again. \nBut over the course of the past few months, Lopez proved doctors wrong â€” and last week, he walked again with the help of new prosthetic legs with microprocessor knees that were donated, in part, by the foundation of Boston Marathon bombing survivor Heather Abbott. \n\nFrench Tattoo Artist Gets World's 1st Prosthetic Arm That Doubles as a Tattoo Machine \n\nFlorida Doctors Separate Conjoined Twins Connected at Heart With Help of 3-D Printing \n\n4-Year-Old Whose Prosthetic Leg Was Stolen Gets New 'Ghostbusters'-Themed Limb, Free Trip to Disneyland \nAbbott, who lost a leg in the 2013 bombing, told ABC News today that she started the Heather Abbott Foundation in December 2014 to help provide customized prostheses to those who have suffered limb loss through traumatic circumstances. \n\nWLS \nHeather Abbott's foundation donated the two microprocessor controlled knees that Vidal Lopez uses and is able to walk again. Abbott is a Boston Marathon bombing survivor. \n\"Prosthetics that really allow you to live life as you had before losing a limb are typically not covered by health insurances and are extremely expensive,\" Abbott said. \"That really inspired me to start the foundation.\" \nThough Lopez got mechanical prosthetic legs and knees in November, they only allowed him to stay upright and walk at one speed, according to his prosthetist David Rotter, who works in Chicago . \nRotter told ABC News the mechanical prostheses limited Lopez's mobility, keeping him dependent on ambulatory aids and a wheelchair. \nSo Lopez applied for a grant to get better prostheses called microprocessor knees through the Heather Abbott Foundation, Rotter said. \nThe microprocessor knees provide a more sophisticated way to control prosthetic knees and legs, Rotter said. Sensors in the knee detect changes in the environment, such as differences in terrain, that will allow Lopez to walk with a more stable gait and at any speed he desires. \n\nWLS \nVidal Lopez, 19, lost both his legs above the knee after a car accident in Mexico in the summer of 2016. On Feb. 6, 2017, he was able to walk again with the help of two microprocessor controlled knees donated by the foundation of Heather Abbott. \nLopez received the microprocessor knees on Feb. 6. Within four days, he trained himself to walk with them without any help, according to Rotter. \n\"To go from a wheelchair to that level of use is pretty extraordinary,\" Rotter said. \"It usually takes weeks or months to get used to them.\" \nLopez told ABC News that he credits Abbott's foundation with giving him the hope and determination to get back on his feet so quickly. \n\"In a couple of weeks and months, I hope I'm going to walk even better,\" he said. \"Then, I want to return to college next summer and become an engineer.\"\n  \" \nBoston Marathon bombing survivor helps teen get special prostheses to walk again \" \nFormerly Conjoined Twins Get Send-Off at Hospital Where They Were Separated \" \nCDC Issues New Vaccine Guidelines for Adults \" \nFacebook Post Helps Toddler Get Kidney From Parents' Former HS Classmate \" \nFlu Takes a Toll in NYC, With 4 Children Reported Dead \" \nMumps Outbreak Reaches 367 Cases in Washington State \" \nGirl Surprised With Super Bowl Tickets After Being Treated for Rare Cancer \" \nIn Chicago, Witnesses to Violence Turn to First Aid to Save Lives \" \n6-Year-Old Girls Link Intelligence to Men Over Women, Study Says \" \nAvian Flu Outbreaks Raise Concerns About Possible Pandemic \" \nSeoul Virus Spread by Pet Rats Under Investigation in Multiple States Teacher Aide Accused of Faking Cancer to Hide Criminal Past \" \nMore Chronically Ill Patients Have Health Insurance After ACA, Study Finds \" \n11-Year-Old Boy Is One of the Youngest to Get Artificial Heart   \nMan     \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:33:53.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
