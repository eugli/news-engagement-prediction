Bolt beat Mo Farah and Andy Murray among others to the award Credit: EPA \nT he 30-year-old was recognised after becoming the first athlete to win each of the 100 metres, 200m and 4x100m at three successive Olympics, although he was stripped of his 2008 relay title last month after Jamaica team-mate Nesta Carter failed a drugs test. \nMurray and Farah were not the only Britons to miss out on the top prizes after Laura Kenny was beaten to the Sportswoman of the Year gong by gymnastics sensation Simone Biles, who won four gold medals and one bronze at Rio 2016. \nElaine Thompson, Katie Ledecky, Angelique Kerber and Allyson Felix were the other nominees. \nLeicester City’s 5,000-1 Premier League title triumph was recognised at yet another awards ceremony, with the club handed Laureus’s Spirit of Sport prize.

He was picked ahead of Britain’s Nick Skelton, whose Rio 2016 show jumping triumph ended his quarter-of-a-century wait for gold. \nThe one Briton recognised was downhill mountain bike champions Rachel Atherton, who was named Action Sportsperson of the Year.
