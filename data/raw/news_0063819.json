(Raj K Raj/HT Photo) \nActivists of the RSS-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) clashed with members of the Left-leaning Students Federation of India (SFI) at the Savitribai Phule Pune University on Friday night, following a dispute over putting up posters on the Ramjas College controversy. \nFive students sustained minor injuries in the incident, and both groups have lodged complaints against each other. Police are recording their statements. \nSources said ABVP activists burnt an effigy of JNU student Umar Khalid, who was arrested for sedition last year, on Friday morning. SFI members retaliated later that evening by putting up posters condemning Maharashtra education minister Vinod Tawde for “threatening” their colleagues at a Solapur polytechnic college – an act that raised the ABVP’s hackles.
