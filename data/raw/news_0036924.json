He returned to Dhaka on Feb 9. \nThough he had been well for a few days, he was taken to BSMMU on Thursday because of the recurrence of back pains. \nAt BSMMU, he was admitted under the care of Prof Atiqul Haque of the Department of Internal Medicine, his son-in-law Azimul Haque Raihan told bdnews24.com. But Anisuzzaman was later taken home, his son Aninda Zaman told bdnews24.com.\n“The doctor in Thailand said his back pain would improve, but we have seen no improvement.” \n“His medical documents were sent to BSMMU on Friday. This morning (Saturday) VC Prof Kamrul Hassan Khan told us to take him to the hospital.” \nAn infection of the lung was causing the back pain, said Prof Atiqul Haque, while admitting the professor. \n“As today is his 81st birthday we were allowed to take him home for a few hours so his students and fans could wish him,” said Aninda Zaman. \nEducation Minister Nurul Islam Nahid visited Prof Anisuzzaman at the hospital. \nAsked what further treatment could be expected, Azimul Haque said: “The internal medicine department will look into the matter first, then we can decide on treatment.” \nProf Anisuzzaman was born on Feb 18, 1937, in the Chabbish Pargana district in West Bengal. He came to Bangladesh following the Partition. \nBefore coming to Dhaka University, he taught at Chittagong University. He is known for playing an active role in the movements against fundamentalism and fanaticism.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T15:45:38.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
