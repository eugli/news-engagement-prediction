It’s also close to all of the towers, so we’re two blocks away from a thousand people.” For The Court, Shad and Field teamed up with Traci Jenks of Cushman & Wakefield, the exclusive leasing agent for the SunTrust Tower, to get a five year lease for the space. In turn, food trucks pay a $35 per day fee to use one of the four spots. For its grand opening on Thursday, Muzzy’s Madhouse, Butt Hutt Smokehouse, Guanabana and Son of a Butcher were all there to be the inaugural four trucks. Trucks can sign up on an online registry for one of the spots, Shad said. So far, the next three months have been booked. “It was important to us and to SunTrust to activate this space,” Shad said. For both Field, who founded Jax Truckies and Jaxsons Night Market, and Shad, who was Public Parking Officer for the City of Jacksonville, creating a permanent food truck spot made sense. “Food trucks are easy and it meant us providing something people want,” Shad said. “For Downtown to be successful, it must be fun and exciting. If businesses decide to move Downtown, they’re looking to keep their employees happy. For us, it meant looking at house the city can take advantage of the assets Downtown has.” Field agreed. “There needs to be more cool things Downtown,” he said. “Here’s a block that’s been dead for years.” In addition to being open for lunch Monday through Friday, the plan is to be open for special events such as Art Walk. There is hope that The Court will be successful enough to operate nights and weekends. “For us, it’s not about a special event or a grand opening, it’s a marathon,” said Shad. “We’re happy if the trucks are happy and keep coming back. We want to be part of the fabric of Downtown. We’ll be really excited if nights and weekends work, because we think we can provide enough variety people might drive Downtown for this and come to a place where there’s something for everyone.” Jensen covers technology, retail and entrepreneurship.
