After one of the most contentious Oscar races in recent history, Moonlight , a film about the young black gay man coming of age, won over La La Land , which held the record for the most-Oscar-nominated musical film to date. \nBut Moonlight's win was overshadowed by a massive blunder which saw La La Land announced as the Best Picture winner, only for the favourite's producer, Jordan Horowitz, to interrupt acceptance speeches with the news that the wrong victor had been named. \nChaos duly reigned on stage as La La Land's cast and crew grappled with the turn of fortunes. As the audience applauded, open-mouthed, host Jimmy Kimmel tried to explain what had happened, before Warren Beatty took to the mic, sheepishly grinning through the madness. \nIt didn't take long for speculation to start raging on social media as to how such a monumental error took place during Hollywood's slickest awards ceremony. Here's what has unfolded so far: Fred Berger: 'We lost, by the way' Pretty cool how that 3rd producer still felt entitled to give a thank you speech even tho, by then, he clearly knew they had lost... https://t.co/KImz0FXEGk — Rachele Lynn (@RacheleLynn6) February 27, 2017 \nW e don't know when La La Land producer Fred Berger realised the film hadn't won, but he interrupted his own acceptance speech with the news when the schemozzle going on behind him became too much to ignore. At this point, fellow producer Jordan Horowitz took to the microphone to explain the mishap: Jordan Horowitz: 'This is not a joke, Moonlight has won Best Picture' You know who is a real hero right now? Jordan Horowitz. Dude dealt with the situation with the utmost grace & dignity. — Kevin Ketchum (@Kevin_Ketchum) February 27, 2017 \nH orowitz has been praised for his grace and dignity in taking control of the situation that was rapidly unwinding on stage. \"Guys, guys, I'm sorry, no\", he said, stopping Berger, who had turned away from the podium clutching the Oscar his film hadn't won, \"There's a mistake\". Horowitz gently pushed Beatty out of the way to gesture to the cast and crew of Moonlight and say, \"Moonlight, you guys won best picture\". \n\"This is not a joke\", he continued, beckoning for the film's makers to come up on stage, repeating himself before he grabbed the card out of the envelope in Beatty's hand and shows it to the camera: \"Moonlight. Best Picture\". \nAfter the furore, Horowitz explained what was going on to The Hollywood Reporter : \nGuys in headsets starting buzzing around. They took the envelope I had. It said Emma Stone in La La Land on it. It was clear there was something wrong. They started looking for the best picture envelope. Nobody knew where it was. Then it appeared. They opened it next to me and it said Moonlight, and so I grabbed it. I had to fix the situation. Jimmy Kimmel: 'I think you guys should keep it anyway' La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz holds up the winner card reading actual Best Picture winner Moonlight Credit: Kevin Winter \nT he Oscars host tried to make light of the kind of disaster live television staff have nightmares about. \"I think you guys should keep it anyway\", he joked to Horowitz, before addressing the audience and the millions of global viewers: \"This is very unfortunate what happened. Personally I blame Steve Harvey [the presenter who announced the wrong Miss Universe 2015 winner] for this\". \nTurning back to Horowitz to kill time while the cast of Moonlight made their way to the stage, Kimmel said: \"I would like to see you get an Oscar anyway, why can't we give out a whole bunch of them?\" \nHorowitz, again, rose above the confusion: \"I'm going to be really proud to hand this to my friends from Moonlight\",he said earning a cheer from the crowd. Warren Beatty: 'I was given the wrong envelope' To recap:Beatty gets wrong envelope. (How?)Sees problem, doesn't want to announce.Tries to show Dunaway why.She says, \"La La Land.\" — Kim Masters (@kimmasters) February 27, 2017 \nT he Hollywood veteran then claimed he was given the wrong envelope with a card that named Emma Stone as Best Actress in a Leading Role for La La Land. He showed co-presenter Faye Dunaway and, in a moment of confusion, she announced La La Land as the winner rather than wait for the Best Picture envelope. \n\"I opened the envelope, and it said: \"Emma Stone, La La Land\". That's why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn't trying to be funny!\" \n\"Well you were funny, very funny\", retorted Kimmel, with the air of a man desperate to get Beatty off the stage. \n\"This is Moonlight, Best Picture\", Beatty finally announced. Dunaway is no-where to be seen. 3)... TWO best actress envelopes. Here's a close up of the envelope in Warren's hand. Best actress.

Emma Stone: 'I was holding my Best Actress in a Leading Role card the whole time' \nEmma Stone, who picked up one of La La Land's six Oscars, explained her side of the story in the press room afterwards: \nI was holding my best actress card the whole time so whatever story you heard, I don't know what happened, but I wanted to tell you that.
