It will come at about 12.15pm. There is a statement first on airport expansion, followed by the business statement.\nPresumably the white paper will be published around the time Davis starts addressing MPs.\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.22am GMT 09:22 \nThe main event today will be the publication of the government’s white paper on Brexit, although few people are expecting it to tell us anything significant about Theresa May’s plans that we did not already know. The fear is that it will be more of a blank paper than a white paper. But who knows? We’ll find out later.\nIn the meantime, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has been on the Today programme talking about what last night’s Brexit vote means for Labour. As our overnight splash says, a fifth of Labour MPs defied the whip and voted against the bill giving the government the authority to trigger article 50.\nBrexit: fifth of Labour MPs defy three line whip to vote against article 50 bill Read more \nThe rebels included 10 shadow ministers and three whips who are still in post. Asked if they would all be sacked, McDonnell implied strongly that some or all of them would keep their jobs. He replied:\n\nWhat I’m saying is that if you are in the shadow cabinet or cabinet, the normal conventions will apply, you will be expected to resign. But for other positions, the normal process is that the chief whip will then report, and they will report after the legislation is through, on the process from there on in. \nSo could they stay in post, he was asked. He replied:\n\nI’m not going to pre-empt what the whip is going to recommend.\nMcDonnell was effectively rewriting parliamentary rules. In reality the “normal convention” at Westminster is that if a frontbencher votes against the party whip, they either resign or get sacked immediately, regardless of whether they are in the cabinet or shadow cabinet or whether they hold a more junior frontbench post. But there is some precedent for letting junior shadow ministers vote against a whip without being punished (three junior Labour frontbenchers did that in the vote on article 50 in December last year and escaped being sacked) and it is not hard to see why Jeremy Corbyn may decide that it makes sense to take a lenient approach this time. He does not want to entrench party divisions on this any further. And, besides, it was hard enough filling shadow cabinet posts the last time a lot of vacancies emerged (last summer). There are good reasons for not wanting to go through that all over again.\nThere were other interesting lines in the McDonnell interview. I will post them shortly.\nIt is not clear yet when the Brexit white paper will be published. There is only one other key event on the agenda.\n\n12.30pm: Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, holds a press conference as the Bank publishes its quarterly inflation report.\nAs usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon.\nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter.\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:07:41.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
