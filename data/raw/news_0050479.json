When did Justice Ademola become a beggar. Otile \nPoor logic. The question is, did he receive the money, yes or no, not when did he become a beggar. E gbo? Gabriel Olasebikan \nIs he a prophet or a sahabi? ayomi George \nAPC which way. \nDasuki said he gave Buhari two jeeps and $500k during his infamous lying of Boko Haram attacks, they said its lies now 500k to a judge the witness said he doesn’t consider it bribe. \nWe are listening carefully. oyoko \nif you believe this, then this man, Buhari has gut to still take these people before the law to account for their wrong doing. We need to praise him. He has won my confidence TC \nLmao…common PT……. 500,000 naira only. This type of labarin angwa is not credible. KBE \nEvery judge and lawyer that had large sum of money transferred to them are on trial. All the lawyers that transferred money to a judge are suspected of fraud and being tried. But PMB is above the law and can’t be suspected or tried. The EFCC is daily eroding its credibility and has become a laughing stock. Different strokes for different folks. Romberg \nNo, can’t be true. Is it Mohamadu Buhari that gave the bribe by himself or another Buhari from the pit of hell on behalf of our dearest Mr Integrity!? longben \nNot Muhammadu but “Momodu” Buhari gave the bribe. One owns only a mud house in Daura and the other an estate in Abuja. One is squeaky clean and incorruptible while the other one is the president. You can pick and choose Omo’oba Ifedayo Adebayo \nTo buy groundnuts? Omooba Adekunle Orafidiya \nThe only way Muhammadu Buhari can convincingly deny this allegation is to present his WASC to the public before he dies in London. Suleiman Alatise \nWho is the first to die, you or Buhari? Otile \nAre you therefore wishing Buhari a slow death, are you going to suffer the excruciating pain with him? Omooba Adekunle Orafidiya \nYou, like Buhari, are an illiterate. blueeyedkitten \nanswer the question moron. are you scared of death? Etomi \nHe wants to implicate Buhari o! \nDon’t let anybody hear this one o! \nBuhari is a saint….holy saint!!!! lubem \nchei! Akatikpo \nThe prosecution has bungled the trial of Justice Ademola. All their witnesses are balderdash with no depth. I have read most of their hollow testimonies. When the Judge sets him free, the public will shout corruption. Meanwhile the judge acts on evidence before him and not conjectures. I have not seen a serious direct evidence or a compelling circumstantial evidence linking him to graft. No wonder they introduced a second charge which is illegal possession of firearms which in itself is hollow. The defence team is so sure of themselves and that was why they applied for accelerated hearing. I see Justice Ademola being discharged and acquitted. Broadway2 \nWhy was the judge having so much money at home? George \nThe same reason why Tinubu the apc so called leader is richer than Lagos State ayomi \nYou make too much sense for this platform Broadway2 \nHas Buhari ever called himself a Saint? I wonder why so many comments here are busy calling him Mr Saint. Kamalu \nIf the witness does not consider the N500,000 as bribe, what was it for? There is no reason of speaking from both sides if the mouth. Law deals with facts and he who alleges must provide convincing proof. It’s over to President Buhari’s lawyer who allegedly gave the money to validate or invalidate the claim of Justice Ademola’s witness. Gbola \nBut that lawyer has to be at least charged to court for bribery. \nAnd until Ademola reports the crime to the EFCC or the NJC, this remains a distraction. \nThe court doesn’t prosecute. The court renders a verdict to a criminal being prosecuted. \nTo have Buhari’s lawyer prosecuted, they must make a formal complaint to the EFCC, the media OR the NJC. Otile \nIn Taquiyya parlance the money is not bribery, it’s a token of good will. Buhari’s WAEC is equivalent to Masters degree as we are told. Lairs Alhaji \nWell, F9 in WAEC and in mathematics is equivalent to Masters degree in Fulani and Hausa. That is why Nigeria is “progressing.” Very soon $1 will be #1000. Oskirin \nBaba…pls come home 4rm uk 2 defend urcef on ds. Moh’d Maiha \nThis is not a new thing in Nigeria, normally if you are fighting corruption, get ready, definitely corruption would fight you back, so the only thing do not be discourage… Oskirin \nand show proof say d tin wey dem talk na lie…. BURNING SPEAR \nONLY A MONKEY BRAIN—or a human skull filled with cow dung———WILL SAY SUCH CHILDISH things——–IF IT IS NOT BRIBERY THEN TELL ME WHAT IT IS TO THE DEAD BRAIN CELLS OF THE FULANI THIEVES FROM MALI—– Black Pope \nThe same kind of lies the SC justices said about about amaechi initially then they were arrested. Corruption is really fighting back TAWANDA INCOMMUNICADO \nTell that to the dogs, this is an accusation made under oath. Buhari is just another Nigerian politician involved in corruption, lies and mass deception. Joseph \nSO ONCE A STATEMENT IS MADE UNDER OAT, IT MEANS THE STATEMENT IS TRUE? TAWANDA INCOMMUNICADO \nIt is now obvious that Buhari did not pass his WASC because he would not bribe a judge if he did have his certificate, secondly this allegation is straight and uncomplicated, If indeed this accusation was made under oath, Buhari would have been exposed as a first class hypocrite and liar . Gbola \nIa it that youre not aware that people always lie under oath ?? \nOr are you a learner ?? BURNING SPEAR \nWhen the Fulanis from Cameroon and Niger Republic in Nigeria———steal certain 9jas from the old regions of the country often claim it is a new style Buhari has houses in London—-Nigerians operating under the flag of the Tripod kept quiet—Bingo Buhari ati Aisha Buhari–his baby pancake Yawo–ati Amariya serving the elites in Abuja–has Mansions in abuja–while pretending he has no roof over his Fulani head———9jas pretended as if we knew nothing about the 27m he said he borrowed from first bank–to pay for his nomination fees in APC————Again–he has not school certificate–the Yorubas told us even if Buhari presents s NEPA Bill–as his certificate it would be accepted-able to INEC——-Besides–if the alleged bribery of judges with 500,000 by Bingo Buhari had been organized by Ijaw man Jonathan—the drug addict called Magu in efcc–who is currently working for the Apes in APC———– would have alleged the money came from the purse of Deizani –Dudafa or Etete -The truth of the matter is that the money was given to the judge to enable Bingo Buhari escape from being prosecuted——-period -There is no hiding place for him-Bingo Buhari—who is yet to account for the missing 2.8b he stole from the SS –Again-whether dead or alive Bingo Buhari must be put in the dock—ONE DAY——–So let him continue to play hide and seek with our conscience and crude oil resources in London—–if he has any–Bingo Buhari is a thief—and a certificate forger -and must be made to pay for his sins against his adopted country Nigeria———-period- ayomi \nOf course, the Yoruba are responsible Gbola \n\nAnyone who Makes an allegation in court must prove it. \nSince the witness alleged that Buhari “bribed” justice Ademola with 500,000, the onus is on him to prove what he just stated. \nHe claimed that Buhari sent the money through his lawyer to Justice Ademola. Well, Did The meeting where the money exchange took place occur at his chambers or his house ?? \nThis Judge basically dug himself a hole. He basically just told the entire world that he took and does take bribe from people whose cases are pending in court. \nIf this was true and he wasn’t the corrupt type, he would have reported the matter to Jonathan who was the one at the helm at that time. \nCORRUPTION IS SURELY FIGHTING BACK. TAWANDA INCOMMUNICADO \nJustice Ademola cannot present a phantom witness under oath because he knows the legal implication . Buhari has been presenting a fake front to gullible Nigerians as a saint alas all wrong. Gbola \nIf Ademola was a justice with integrity, Did he REJECT the bribe ?? \nWhy Did it take his prosecution for corruption for him to leak out this supposed allegation THROUGH A WITNESS ?? \nAbeg, You get sense pass dis one naw. TAWANDA INCOMMUNICADO \nHe accepted taking the money and it takes two ie the giver and the taker. The logic to be derived from this is that the judge has sealed his case before presenting such a witness under oath. Gbola \nAgain, \nWhy didnt justice Ademola report the bribery to the relevant organization within the Judiciary ?? \nThis supposed bribe wouldn’t have been alleged or revealed had he not been charged to court. \nAnd since he is alleging that Buhari bribed him, the onus is one him to prove the allegation he’s making. \nYou can’t just make an allegation and not prove it. Otherwise, whats to stop him from saying he accepted a bribe even from you. \nThe court isn’t a place where you report a crime. Its the place where prosecution of a crime takes place. \nSo go and tell Ademola to report the crime to the relevant authorities so that charges can be mounted. TAWANDA INCOMMUNICADO \nThere is no statute of limitation plea here, the judge has chosen this platform to expose the bribery and so be it. Gbola \nAnd you’ve already taken his account to be true without any shred of evidence supporting such. \nMoreover, Ademola wasn’t one making this allegation, its the defense witness who of course is attempting to help the case of Ademola. TAWANDA INCOMMUNICADO \nCambridge would have given Buhari a certified copy of his WASC had he applied and the court case would not even be heard secondly he did not and has not tendered a certificate to date. Buhari is most probably a certificateless corrupt leader who bribed a Judge to kill a civil motion brough against him. defash1 \nWhy are you fighting teeth & nail over Buhari? Both Buhari & Ademola do not worth anyone’s sweat, just keep your fingers crossed & watch the drama that unfolds. \nThis is Nigeria where anything goes. Gbola \nWhere is the “teeth and nail” ?? \nDo I need your permission to make an opinion in this media-forum ?? \nYou are free to keep mute and watch as the drama unfolds BUT don’t expect everyone to be without an opinion like you. \nThis is a discussion forum where people air their opinions FOR or AGAINST a given issue OR topic. Doffi Atoshi \nDid he report this to NJC? TAWANDA INCOMMUNICADO \nThat does not make his accusation invalid, he has chosen this platform hence the court will hear him out, it is left for the witness and judge to prove their allegation.
