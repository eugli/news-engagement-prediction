Nate Parker, writer-director of “Birth of a Nation,” was recognized in the Sundance feature film category. The Humanitas kudo aims to recognize works that revolve around efforts to improve the human condition. \nThere was also a tie in the feature documentary category between Ava DuVernay for “13th” and Chris Chuang, Heather MacDonald and Brian Oakes for “Jim: The James Foley Story.” \nIn television, Dan Fogelman won the 60-minute category for the pilot of NBC’s “This Is Us.” Kenya Barris, creator of ABC’s “Blackish,” won the 30-minute category for the “Hope” episode dealing with police brutality. \nLaurie Israel and Rachel Ruderman won for children’s animation for the “Dads and Daughters Day” episode of Disney Channel’s “Sofia the First.” Children’s live-action honors went to Amazon’s “An American Girl Story” (“Melody 1963: Love Has to Win”). \nWinners of Humanitas awards receive a $10,000 stipend. Several of this year’s winners have opted to donate the money to charitable causes. \nThe awards also recognize students and emerging writers through a script competition. The David and Lynn Angell College Comedy Fellowship went to Magdalen Silberman of University of Texas at Austin. \nThe inaugural Carol Mendelsohn College Drama Fellowship went to Munis Rashid of the American Film Institute. \nThe New Voices initiative gives five winners a grant of $15,000 apiece and the opportunity to write a pilot script under the direction of a Humanitas-affiliated showrunner.
