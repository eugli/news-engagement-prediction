Jones IV Privacy Policy \nOmar J. Jones IV was recently promoted to brigadier general in the U.S. Army at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State. Jamie, as he was known when he lived in this area, graduated from Glenelg High School in 1988. He ran cross country and indoor and outdoor track for Coach Roger Volrath. He is the grandson of Omar J. Jones Jr., the former principal of Howard High School and the first Howard County Executive. After graduating from Glenelg, Jamie attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, graduating as first captain, the highest ranking senior cadet at the academy. \nJamie is married to Tracey Scott , who also graduated from Glenelg in 1988. They were married at West Point in 1992, the day after Jamie graduated. Tracey graduated from the University of Maryland the same year. They have three children. Samuel and Benjamin are both attending West Point, following in their dad's footsteps. Samuel will graduate in 2018 and Benjamin in 2020. The youngest son, William, is in the eighth grade. During the 25 years that he has been in the army, Jamie and his family have lived in 13 different places around the country and world. \nHis mom, Carol Jones , a retired Howard County school teacher who lives in Elkridge, was excited to attend the promotion ceremony in Washington. She is proud to be a volunteer with the United Service Organizations, working at both Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport and Fort Meade to support our military men and women. \nJamie and his family try to get back to Howard County to visit family and friends about once a year. Despite all of their travels, they still consider Maryland to be home and hope to return here one day. But, in the meantime, the new brigadier general will continue serving our country as the deputy commanding general for operations of the 7th Infantry Division. Congratulations to Jamie, Tracey and the whole family. \nAmy Bejm Syversen , the director of bands at Dayton Oaks Elementary School is extremely proud of her hardworking students.
