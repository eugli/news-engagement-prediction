From now until 2020, the federal government would pick up 95 percent of the state’s cost – and then would pay 90 percent after that. Who wouldn’t invest $1.5 million to get $1.6 billion? \nThe cost is much more than mere dollars and cents. It means thousands of women won’t get routine tests that may show they’re at risk for cancer, it means diabetics won’t get access to the medicine they need to stay healthy. It means many families will go bankrupt trying to pay medical bills. It means people will die. \nAnd Cooper’s already working with the state’s hospitals and other parts of the state’s health care sector to pick up the difference – so no state funds would be spent. \nEven without the added funding, the Affordable Care Act has had success in North Carolina. Since implementation in 2010, there’s been a 33 percent reduction — 552,000 — of those without insurance. \nBut state Senate boss Phil Berger, R-Rockingham, calls Cooper’s efforts to bring federal tax dollars back to North Carolina to improve health care “budget-busting.” Berger is wrong, irresponsible and lacks credibility. \nAs much as it might be about jobs, economic activity and North Carolinians’ federal tax dollars being shipped elsewhere, it is more basic. It is about caring for those in need. It is about REAL respect for life. It is about doing the right thing. \nThis is abstract. We are talking about our neighbors. It is time for our legislature to do the right thing: Drop the lawsuit against the governor and help him extend health insurance to all of those most in need. \nCopyright 2017 by Capitol Broadcasting Company.
