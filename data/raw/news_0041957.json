(Photo: Joe Tamborello/IndyStar) Buy Photo 158 CONNECT 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nToday is the deadline to have your phone number added to Indiana's Do Not Call List this April. \nAdding your name and phone number to the state's Do Not Call List will prevent the majority of telemarketing calls from reaching your home phone, cellphone or VOIP line. This includes both calls with a live human being and robocalls. \nIndiana's list is updated quarterly in January, April, July and October. If you have previously added your number to the list, you'll only need to update your registration if you've changed addresses or your phone number has changed. You can check to see if your number is included by visiting this page of the Office of the Indiana Attorney General's website . \nIf you have not added your number yet, get started here. You'll need to provide your name and current address along with up to 10 different phone numbers you'd like added to the list. \nFollow IndyStar Social Media Platforms Editor Joe Tamborello on Twitter and Instagram .
