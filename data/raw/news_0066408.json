Bush aid Paris Dennard called it “fake news,” and that the president was “not breaking any laws.”\nThis was apparently more than Lemon could tolerate, and the CNN host went off on a rant.\n“Fake news is when you put out a story to intentionally deceive someone and you know that it is wrong,” said Lemon. “This story that we’re doing right now is not to intentionally deceive anyone. We are simply talking about the cost to keep a president safe.”\n“Please stop it with that stupid talking point, that it is a fake news story,” he continued. “If you don’t want to participate in the news stories on this network, then don’t come on and participate. But don’t call them fake because you don’t agree with them. Go on.”\n“This is a fake news story,” said Dennard.\nLemon then cut Dennard off, and ended the segment.\n“OK, Paris, thank you very much everyone,” Lemon said. “Thanks everyone, thanks for watching. Have a great weekend. Goodnight, all.”", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/5s-qTV2Eez8"], "published": "2017-02-23T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:35:20.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
