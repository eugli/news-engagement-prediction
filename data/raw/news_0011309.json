He didn’t speak about his memories until he had reached quite an advanced age, his late 70s, because it was too painful.” \nAlong with Mr Ferster’s three sons and 92-year-old sister Manya, Hannah hopes to recognise a lasting tribute to honour his memory. \nShe added: “We have files and files of letters from children and adults whose lives he touched. We’re hoping to use those in some way and create a tribute.” \nHundreds of people are expected to honour the inspiring speaker during his funeral at Agecroft Jewish Cemetery at 3.45pm this afternoon.

Six million Jews perished and it must never be forgotten.” \nHe spoke about the hunger and brutal conditions in eight different Nazi concentration camps including Auschwitz in Poland. \nHe also described the emotional re-union with his younger sister after he was liberated by US soldiers. \nBorn into an orthodox Jewish family and raised in the Polish town Sosnowiec, he lost many family members during the Holocaust, before emigrating to England. \nHe embarked on a successful career in business and lived in Cheetham Hill until his death. \nIn 2015, he was awarded a British Empire Medal for services to Holocaust education. \nFor full details of the funeral please contact Goldfines Funeral Directors.
