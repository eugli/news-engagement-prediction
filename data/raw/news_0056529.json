(MLive File Photo) comments \nThe readers have spoken: Clarkston's Dan Fife is the top current high school boys basketball coach in the state of Michigan. \nFife collected 63,496 votes in our poll to edge-out Arthur Hill's Greg McMath, who finished in second place with 61,688 votes. \nClarkston's program has thrived under the guidance of Fife, who is in his 35th year as coach. \nHis record of 664-168 currently puts him at fourth all-time in the MHSAA record books for career wins. \nHe's led his teams to take home 27 league championships, 28 district titles, 11 region championships and two final four appearances. \nThis season Fife's squad is 11-0 (2-0 in the Oakland Activities Association Red Division) and looks to be primed for a state title run. \nHuron's Jay Shunnar, Grand Rapids Forest Hills Central's Ken George and Beaverton's Roy Johnston rounded out the top five in the poll.
