Many Gambian pensioners have been refused their pensions or given less than they are entitled to in recent years, despite having worked for the government all their lives. Some receive just $5 a month. New Gambian president Adama Barrow returns home to joyous scenes Read more \nJammeh was voted out of office after 22 years in power in December . He initially accepted the election result but changed his mind and refused to leave office or the country . \nUnder intense pressure from other African presidents and a regional military force positioned on the Gambia’s borders with Senegal, he finally fled to Equatorial Guinea in late January, taking a fleet of luxury cars with him. \nIt is unclear where the money allegedly taken by Jammeh is being held, if it has not been spent. Gambian ministers said they were relying on donors to help them pay salaries would pursue Jammeh for the money, even if that meant going to his bolthole. \n“This is grave. The economy is in severe distress,” said the interior minister, Mai Fatty. “During the impasse I made mention of $5m. But that is just a drop in the ocean compared to what the ministry of finance revealed. \n“This is a reflection of the gross mismanagement of our economy by Yahya Jammeh and his APRC government. Their conduct amounts to total betrayal of the Gambian people, leaving behind them a monstrous debt of 48.3bn dalasis [$1bn]. \n“As the minister of interior, I have a responsibility to ensure that all those mismanaged public funds are recovered. We will swing into action without any delay. And ministry will leave no stone unturned, if we have to go to Equatorial Guinea, we will.” \nJammeh made “rampant” use of executive directives to obtain cash from state entities, he said. Close aides including Saul Badjie, commander of the republican guards, would allegedly take these executive directives and use them to make withdrawals. \nMore than $50m in income meant for Gamtel, the state telecoms company, was diverted to two accounts at the country’s central bank, which were then emptied of all but about $111,000, the minister of finance said.

I cannot buy a bag of rice from my monthly pay. Three years ago, social security officials came and asked us about our situation. They promised that they were going to increase our income. But nothing has since been done,” he said. \n“We will never forgive Jammeh for taking our money. We worked hard for this country, built roads and spent days and nights in the bushes.” \nAmadou Sanneh, a political prisoner under Jammeh who was appointed finance minister the day after he was released from jail, said there was still much work to be done before the government could ascertain the full extent of the theft. \n“There are other accounts that we have not investigated. We have to pursue every angle, every public enterprise to establish the grand total,” he said. “The end of month is coming. But we will be able to pay salaries. The donors have expressed willingness to give budgetary support. That’s for our short term needs and with that help, we will be able to sustain the government afloat.” \nHe said Jammeh had left the country with only $615,000 in international reserves. \n“Their conduct amounts to total betrayal of the Gambian people,” he said, referring to Jammeh’s party, the APRC. “This is a truly an APRC disaster – in human rights, politically, fiscally, and monetarily, economically and financially. \n“President Adama Barrow will take all steps and measures to ensure that all lost, stolen and misappropriated assets are returned to the Gambian people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:48:13.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
