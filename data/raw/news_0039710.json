He uses the time to pump up their confidence and get to the heart of the problem. (Don Markus) \nCowan was fouled again. This time, he missed the first and made the second. Junior guard Bryant McIntosh missed a runner in the lane, and Dodd got the rebound cleanly this time. He made the first of two to make it a 10-point game. \nIt was the fourth straight victory for Maryland over Northwestern since joining the Big Ten, and the fourth straight time Trimble outplayed his counterpart, McIntosh, who got into early foul trouble and finished with just nine points on 3-of-13 shooting, 0-for-5 on 3s. \nTrimble, who came in having shot just 30 percent over his team’s last four games, made his first two 3s and five of the seven shots he took in the first half. \nHelped by the fact that McIntosh got into early foul trouble, picking up a pair of fouls in the opening three minutes and his third with 4:26 left in the opening half, Maryland led after its first possession and never trailed. \nWhile an early 9-2 lead was followed by seven straight possessions without a point, Trimble helped the Terps regain their touch and build the lead up to 11, 27-16, on a tap-in by senior center Damonte Dodd. \nDespite the absence of McIntosh, who had more fouls than points (two) in the half, the Wildcats twice cut their deficit to seven before a three-point play by Trimble with 2.4 seconds left made it 32-22. \nTrimble finished the half with 13 points, while Dodd and freshman guard Anthony Cowan each had six. The Terps shot 13-of-29 in the half, including four of nine on 3-pointers, and had seven of their shots blocked. \nSophomore center Dererk Pardon led Northwestern with six points. The Wildcats shot 9-of-28 in the half, including just 2-of-12 on 3-pointers. McIntosh, who was coming off a 25-point performance in Sunday’s upset at Wisconsin, was 1-of-six in the first half. \nTrimble, who had scored just one point in the second half in each of the last games, drove twice for baskets early in the second half, hit one of two free throws after driving a third time and then hit his third straight 3-pointer with 6-foot-6 defender Sanjay Lumpkin in his face. \nThe 3-pointer increased the lead to 44-31. After Dodd made one of two free throws, Trimble hit a deep 3-pointer from the left wing to increase Maryland’s lead to 18. That silenced what had been a loud and rowdy crowd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:31:21.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
