Addressing the gathering at Isha Yoga Centra after unveiling the 112-feet tall bust of Adiyogi — a form of Shiva, the Prime Minister said that progress of humanity is incomplete without the empowerment of the women. \nModi said that he was proud of Indian culture where the role of women is pivotal. Women are manifestation of the divine whereas men have to do good things to attain divinity, he said. \nModi said that divinity can be achieved through yoga, which is ancient yet modern, constant yet evolving. “Yoga is the catalyst that assures transformation from jeeva to Shiva. It is the journey from me to we,” he said. He added that by practicing yoga, one can attain peace of mind and it helps to live in sync with ecology. \nWith yoga, a person can overcome stress and chronic condition, he said, citing an increase in alcohol and substance abuse. “Yoga is the passport to health assurance,” he said. An idea should not be rejected, just because it is ancient, the Prime Minister said. “Our mind should always be open to new thoughts, but there are a select few who, because of their own ignorance, ignore these ideas.” \nModi said that diversity was the reason behind our togetherness, not the cause of conflicts. Appreciating Sadhguru for creating yogis out of ordinary people, he said that the Adiyogi statue is going to be the source of inspiration for many to discover the truth.
