Childhood obesity \nThe idea was to tackle childhood obesity by applying a levy that increased according to the amount of sugar in drinks - with the money being spent on improving health in schools. \nThe government forecast it would raise £520m in 2018-19 - and expected that it would be an incentive for the food and drinks industry to cut levels of sugar. \nThe levy provides capital funding to support facilities for sports, after-school activities and to encourage healthy eating - but it will not pay for PE teachers or other staff. \nAll state-funded primary and secondary schools and sixth forms will receive a slice of the sports levy, but there will also be a bidding process for funding for specific projects. \n\"Schools can really help our children get a healthy start in life from exercise and sport, and also from knowing what a healthy diet means,\" said Ms Greening. \n\"It's not only good for them while they're in education, but the health and wellbeing benefits can last a lifetime.\" Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:01:49.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
