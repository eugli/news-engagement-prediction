It was a miserable day for Alonso and McLaren Credit: Mark Thompson/Getty Images \nH amilton managed 73 laps after Bottas, who began the Mercedes programme on Monday morning, posted 79. \nThe overhaul of technical regulations over the winter had been hoped to shake up a sport which has been criticised for becoming too predictable but while the cars are different in their appearance - lower, wider and quicker - the pecking order is not. \nIt was a thoroughly impressive and ominous show from Mercedes - a team which has won 51 of the last 59 races en route to claiming three consecutive driver and constructor titles - which will leave Hamilton confident he can become the first British driver to win a quartet of championships.
