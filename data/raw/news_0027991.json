Wong Queer Voices Senior Editor, The Huffington Post \nLGBTQ people of all ages are encouraged to hold their loved ones close in a heartwarming new ad campaign for the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ). \nReleased Feb. 9, the ‚ÄúHold Tight‚Äù clip is intended to commemorate Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras , which kicks off Friday Feb. 17, and the Auckland Pride Festival (Feb. 10 ‚Äï 26). ANZ is a sponsor of both celebrations. \n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre aiming to highlight what is a gesture that is difficult for many in the LGBTI community and turn it into a celebration of love and by asking people to ‚Äòhold tight,‚Äô when they feel like letting go,‚Äù officials wrote in a blog post on ANZ‚Äôs website . The company is also releasing a custom-made wristband, and asking customers and supporters to share images of themselves with the hashtag #HOLDTIGHT on social media. ‚ÄúIt is recognition that equality has come a long way, but that it still has a way to go, and is a message to the community to stay strong,‚Äù they added. \nThis isn‚Äôt the first time that the company has gone to colorful lengths to express its LGBTQ support. Last year, ANZ‚Äôs Sydney offices were re-branded as GAYNZ , while new ‚ÄúGAYTM‚Äù machines appeared at three branches in the city. \nThe continued support doesn‚Äôt go unnoticed, ANZ! ‚ù§Ô∏è \nFor the latest in LGBTQ culture, don‚Äôt miss the Queer Voices newsletter .
