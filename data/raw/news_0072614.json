Article continues below \nAll of this trash-talking must be doing wonders for pre-orders on Sky Box Office - and no doubt the British broadcaster made even more money off the back of their head-to-head meeting on ’The Gloves Are Off’. \nThe half-hour show was shown on Sunday evening and, at various points, it felt more like a fiery episode of Eastenders rather than a discussion between two sportsmen. Article continues below Chris Smalling angers Liverpool fans with tweet after Man Utd win EFL Cup Twitter: Bellew won the war of words \nMany viewers on Twitter thought that while Bellew might not beat Haye on Saturday night - the 34-year-old is the 9/2 outsider coming into the fight - he won the war of words on this occasion. Video: The moment Bellew rustled Haye \nAnd this was one moment in particular where Bellew clearly rustled Haye. \n“Name me a top heavyweight you’ve beat,” Bellew asked the 36-year-old. \n“No, I can’t name you one,” Haye responded, sarcastically. “I’ve never beaten anyone of any note.” \nBellew responded by saying that Haye’s win over Jean-Marc Mormeck, 10 years ago, was the best win of his career - but the Bermondsey-born fighter was clearly irritated by the question. \n“I haven’t had a good fight in 10 years, I’m super slow, I’m old, inactive, don’t have any heart - all of this stuff,” Hate continued. “Take it all on board, believe it, soak it up, enjoy it.” \n“Did I say you were washed up?” Bellew added. \n“You insinuated it,” Haye replied. “You said you’ve studied my resume, so you should know. Why ask the question?” \nBellew then asked again: “When was the last time you had a real, solid hard fight?” \n“Why do you need to know,” Haye bit back. “He’s [Jonny Nelson] supposed to be asking the questions.” \nNelson then had to intervene at this point to stop the pair of them from taking it further. \nWatch it here... \nHaye has recorded some big victories during his career - against the likes of Nikolai Valuev, Dereck Chisora and the aforementioned Mormeck - but lost in arguably his biggest fight against Wladimir Klitschko back in July 2011. Bellew questions Haye's record \n\"He just likes to make out he's something that he's not, that he's so great, that he's perfect when he's not,\" Bellew was quoted as saying by the Mirror . \"He's going on that he's this heavyweight. Name me a top-10 heavyweight he's beaten. Name me one. \n\"He hasn't got a win over one top-10 heavyweight. \n\"He's faced one in Wladimir Klitschko, and he got played with for 12 rounds. He basically s**t himself and blamed his little toe. It was one of the most embarrassing things I've ever seen. \n\"He beat John Ruiz who was way, way past his sell-by date. He was older than my grandad. \n\"I'm not even going to attempt to say that Nikolai Valuev was any good. He was a freak show. He was a circus act.” \nYou can watch ‘The Gloves Are Off’ in full here… \nWill Tony Bellew beat David Haye this weekend?
