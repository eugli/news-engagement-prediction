Swedish police demand government action as city is overrun by armed youths Help us! Swedish police demand government action as city is overrun by armed youths SWEDISH police have demanded the Government get armed youths off the streets, as Malmo is being turned into a ‘no-go zone’ where violent crime and shootings are common occurrences. PUBLISHED: 12:22,  39, Thu, Feb 9, 2017 \nMalmo, which is Sweden ’s third-largest city, has been plunged into chaos as police struggle to maintain law and order. \nAn llegal firearms trade is flourishing in the city amid the European Union ’s inability to crack down on thugs smuggling weapons across their borders. \nMore than 200 illegal firearms are confiscated by police each year, but legal loopholes often allow those caught with weapons to walk free. \nInterior Minister Anders Ygeman has previously raised the issue as he urged the EU to take action to halt firearms being smuggled across borders.

I believe I was met with good understanding.” \nDespite the interior ministry vowing to put pressure on Brussels to halt the trade, Mr Ygeman will be urged to take further action when he visits the struggling city next week. \nStefan Sintéus said there has been a serious spike in shooting and murder among minors in the city. \nThe police chief said the youths caught with firearms need to be removed from the streets. We are concerned that young people have armed themselves Stefan Sintéus, Malmo police chief \nMr Sintéus said: “They can’t remain in Malmo. We are concerned that young people have armed themselves. We are very concerned.” \nIn January, the Sweden Democrats lambasted the situation as they demanded soldiers should be sent to Malmo to reestablish rule of law in the city . \nLaunching a seething attack on the red-green parties in Malmo, Magnus Olsson said it was time to call in the military to root out the escalating crisis. \nSpeaking to Expressen, Mr Olsson also said there was a lack of police officers in Sweden, emphasising the need for military support.
