British supermarkets begin RATIONING lettuce, broccoli and courgettes after snow and storm decimated supplies in the Mediterranean \nSigns capping the numbers of items shoppers can buy have sprung up amid fears prices could soar By Laura Burnip Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Comments VEGETABLES are being rationed in supermarkets across the UK after storms ravaged farms in the Mediterranean, causing huge supply problems across Europe. \nSigns warning customers they can only buy limited numbers of certain items have sprung up in stores, while online shoppers unable to order basic vegetables such as lettuces as they are out of stock. Rob White/Instagram 4 Tesco has been forced to ration lettuce supplies in some stores, while online stocks are severely depleted \nAnd there are fears the severe shortage could lead to a European trade war – with industry experts warning the UK could end up with nothing if France and Germany are prepared to pay more for their veg. \nThe drought began with aubergines and courgettes, but customers can expect shortages of iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, mixed leaves, rocket, lollo rossa, cauliflower, broccoli, peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, lemons, and oranges, reports the Daily Mail . \nMorrisons has imposed a limit of three heads of broccoli and three iceberg lettuces per customer throughout its 492 stores. \nAnd some Tesco stores are also displaying signs capping lettuces at three per person. \nIceberg lettuces were also listed as out of stock on Tesco and Sainsbury’s websites tonight. \nA Morrisons spokesman said: “As a result of the fact that the Spanish harvest has been very difficult this year, we have just about enough coming in to supply our customers.” \n“We want to stop local tradespeople, restaurateurs, coming in and buying lots of stock. It is important that there is good availability for our customers.” \nA notice in some Tesco stores reads: “Due to continued weather problems in Spain there is a shortage of iceberg lettuce. \n“To protect the availability to all our customers, we are limiting bulk purchases to 3 per person. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.” 4 Sainsbury’s also had Iceberg lettuces listed as unavailable \nTesco said: “Due to bad weather conditions in Spain, we are experiencing a few availability issues, but are working with our suppliers to resolve them as quickly as possible.” \nAnd Sainsbury’s said: “Severe weather has affected crops, but we are working with our suppliers to maintain supply for our customers.” \nIndustry experts warned Britain could end up fighting with its European rivals to snap up the limited supply of veg from the Mediterranean. \nBritish Leafy Salads Association (BLSA) spokesman Dieter Lloyd said: “If the German or French markets are prepared to pay more for the product, we could end up with nothing. \n“These difficult trading conditions are set to continue into February and March.” \nHe said contingency supplies were expected to be flown in from the US but this was an “expensive solution”. \nWhere stores have vegetables, prices are considerably higher than a year ago. \nFor example, the cost of an aubergine is up from 60p to 70p – 17per cent.

Went to buy a 🥒 this evening and horrified to fine that there weren't any. The #courgettecrisis is real and I am now it's latest victim 😪😂", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:39:55.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
