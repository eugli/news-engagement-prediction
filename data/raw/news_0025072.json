It's fine,\" he said. \nThe very frosty relationship between the two boiled over on Tuesday with Chong Wei saying he’s ready to quit BAM. \nAnd the straw that broke the camel’s back was the knee injury that Chong Wei suffered when he slipped and fell at the newly-opened Academy Badminton Malaysia in Bukit Kiara on Saturday. \nThat has ruled him out of next month's All-England competition. \nRelated story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T13:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T09:41:48.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
