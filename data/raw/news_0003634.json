Dylan, the most acclaimed and influential songwriter of the past half century, who more than anyone brought rock from the streets to the lecture hall, received an honorary Pulitzer Prize on Monday April 7, 2008, cited for his \"profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\" (AP Photo/File) FILE - In this Jan. 12, 2012 file photo, Bob Dylan performs in Los Angeles. The electric guitar that Bob Dylan plugged in at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 may be the most historic instrument in rock music, and it has sat mostly unnoticed in a New Jersey attic for most of the 47 years since. Dylan left it behind in an airplane and it was taken home by the pilot. The late pilot's daughter recently took it to PBS' \"History Detectives,\" who authenticated the potentially fortune-making find in an episode that will air starting next Tuesday, July 17.
