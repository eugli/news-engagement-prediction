Close Inside Lorna Jane's LA home UP NEXT VIDEO Inside Lorna Jane's LA home \nAmy Robinson, who ran the Brisbane airport DFO store in 2012, also says she suffered physical and psychiatric injuries due to her treatment by area manager Megan McCarthy, the Brisbane District Court heard on Tuesday. \nAccording to an amended statement of claim, McCarthy \"bullied, harassed, demeaned and discriminated\" against Ms Robinson, picked on her because of her weight, bullied her via social media and assigned inappropriate work hours in conjunction with her child-care responsibilities. Amy Robinson is suing over alleged poor treatment at the hands of an area manager. Photos: AAP \n\"McCarthy was acting inappropriately in the workplace and causing undue mental distress to its employees,\" the claim states. \nDuring her stint at the DFO Lorna Jane store, Ms Robinson was called an \"oxygen thief\" by her manager, who also labelled her a \"generator\". \nMcCarthy, the court heard, used this as a pejorative term against those she perceived as generating problems for her to deal with. ‘It’s a massive no’: Aussies pan British Bunnings ad rip-off \nShe had also heavily criticised the appearance of the store Robinson was running, saying in front of staff \"it looked like s***\". \nOnly a little more than a month after starting Ms Robinson arranged a meeting with Queensland manager Claire Perrin, during which she cried as she detailed the allegedly abusive treatment. \n\"Perrin apologised for the behaviour of McCarthy and assured (Robinson) that she would not encounter the same problems in the future,\" the claim states. \nLorna Jane, however, failed to take any appropriate or reasonable steps to remedy the abuse, Ms Robinson's lawyers claim. \nThe court also heard McCarthy had told an indigenous employee and third-in-charge of the store to not play \"black music\". \nRobinson, who is a single mother, has not been able to work since leaving Lorna Jane in December 2012, the court heard. \nSeveral of her former staff are expected to be called to give evidence as the matter proceeds. \nLorna Jane has stridently rejected Ms Robinson's claims.
