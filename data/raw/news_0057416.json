We expect that our partners do the same, particularly when we are talking about minors on their own, ” Hollande stressed. \n“ I call on the United Kingdom to accept its responsibility for teenagers in France at the moment who have family on the other side of the Channel, ” he said. \nMany of the refugee children stranded in France are living in temporary shelters, such as the French government’s official camp at Dunkirk, or on the streets of Paris. Many are still making their way across Europe to Calais in the hope of reaching the UK. \nIn an open letter drafted by the British Red Cross, 17 young refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan describe themselves as “ the lucky ones ” after being settled in the UK. \nOne refugee, who is now 18 years old, said: “ They should make it easier for children to come safely to the UK. I saw so many people die, this is a deadly journey. ” \nDowning Street has rejected Hollande’s criticism. \n“ We have done a huge amount of work in accepting asylum seekers and vulnerable children from France and that work continues, as it does in Europe and other parts of the world ,” the PM’s spokeswoman said. \n“ In the past year alone we’ve taken 8,000 children. So, I don’t accept the suggestion we are not doing enough work .”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:53:49.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
