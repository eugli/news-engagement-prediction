CBS 2 Keen viewers spotted something a little odd about Adele’s hand during her acceptance speech \nShe also won the Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Pop Solo Performance prizes, taking home each gong she was nominated for. \nThis morning there has been plenty of press coverage for her emotional acceptance speech of Album of the Year in which she shocked fans by announcing she didn’t deserve it . \nThe 28-year-old singer explained that Beyonce had been such an influence in her and her friend’s lives that she felt the album Lemonade deserved the title. 2 The bendy thumb was spotted by a number of people who took to Twitter to discuss the unusual digit \nThe moving speech was greeted with rapturous applause but keen eyed viewers were more distracted by Adele’s hands than her words. \nAs the singer gestured and moved her hand around you can see that her thumb bends all the way back to a right angle. \nThe thumb flex was then accentuated by her long acrylic nail which made the digit look unnatural in its bendy state. \nAmazed viewers took to Twitter to express their dismay at this display of dexterity.
