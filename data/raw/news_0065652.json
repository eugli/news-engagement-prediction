Senate Bill 309 would eliminate a discount homeowners and businesses receive when they buy back extra energy they had sent to the electric grid because they had generated more than they needed. \nMore Ikea coverage: Portillo's to build in Fishers near Ikea \nOpponents of the bill said it would discourage homeowners, businesses and schools from switching to solar energy because it will cut into their electric savings. Some larger users, such as schools, say it could cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars over several years. \n“This bill fundamentally and significantly changes the compensation for investing in new energy production,” said Kerwin OIson, executive director of the Citizens Action Coalition. “It is having a chilling effect on homeowners, businesses and schools.” \nIkea, though, would not be affected by the rule change because it never produces more power than it needs and, therefore, doesn't send any electricity to the grid. Roth said Ikea’s solar energy provides 20 to 60 percent of the electricity a store needs, with the rest being drawn from the local utility grid. \n“We use solar to supplement the energy we take from the grid, not replace it,” Roth said.

(Photo: Michelle Pemberton/Indy Star, Michelle Pemberton/Indy Star) \nA typical Ikea store has about 4,000 rooftop solar panels that generate more than a megawatt of energy. But the store uses an enormous amount of energy for lighted displays, kitchen service and air conditioning, so even a megawatt, which is enough to power about 100 homes, doesn't provide enough juice for everything. \nThe company touts itself as an environmentally conscientious corporation that is “about living within the limits of the planet and protecting the environment,” according to its sustainability strategy. \nAt least one local company has a bid on the Fishers Ikea job. Bob McKinney, president of Johnson Melloh Solutions in Indianapolis, said his company is talking to a general contractor in California that Ikea favors, REC Solar, to negotiate what type of subcontract work it can do on the Fishers store. \n\"Our bid was to construct, engineer and do everything, but they like to use REC so we'll see what they want us to do,\" McKinney said. \nIkea would not disclose how much it costs to install solar panels or what the cost savings would be. But at Sheridan Schools in Hamilton County, Johnson-Melloh built a 1.8 megawatt system that costs $4.3 million over 20 years for installation, operation and maintenance. Sheridan schools business manager Robin Popejoy said the system will save $4 million to $5 million over 25 years, and estimated SB 309 would cost the district up to $900,000 in that time. \nMore solar legislation coverage:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T17:40:21.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
