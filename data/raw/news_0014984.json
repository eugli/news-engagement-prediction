Last month Variety reported that director Antoine Fuqua had departed the project which was looking to cast Rogue One star Diego Luna in the lead role. \n(Photo: AP) \n1983's Scarface , directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, featured a powerhouse performance by Al Pacino as Cuban refugee Tony Montana, who becomes a drug kingpin in 1980s Miami. \nScarface first came to the silver screen in 1932 starring Paul Muni and directed by Howard Hawks. It was based loosely on the life of gangster Al Capone.
