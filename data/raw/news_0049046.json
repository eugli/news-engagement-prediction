Many in the crowd chanted \"No ban, no wall. The Trump regime has got to fall.\" They held aloft signs saying \"Uphold the Constitution Now\" and \"Impeach the Liar.\" \nA rally in downtown Los Angeles also drew thousands. Demonstrators there called attention to Trump's crackdown on immigration and his party's response to climate change and the environment. Organizers said they chose to rally on the holiday as a way to honor past presidents by exercising their constitutional right to assemble and peacefully protest. \nIn Chicago, several hundred rallied across the river from the Trump Tower, shouting \"Hey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump has got to go.\" \nRebecca Wolfram of Chicago, who's in her 60s, said concerns about climate change and immigrant rights under Trump prompted her to start attending rallies. Graphiq \n\"I'm trying to demonstrate as much as possible until I figure out what else to do,\" said Wolfram, who held a sign that said \"Old white ladies are really displeased.\" \nSeveral hundred demonstrated in Washington, D.C. Dozens gathered around the fountain in Dupont Circle chanting \"Dump Trump\" and \"Love, not hate: That's what makes America great.\" \nDozens marched through midtown Atlanta for a rally named with a Georgia flavor: \"ImPEACH NOW! (Not My) President's Day March.\" \nHundreds of protesters chanting \"This is what democracy looks like\" marched through Salt Lake City. \nThe Salt Lake Tribune reports (http://bit.ly/2kFqWIG) that the crowd marched to push back against Trump and his administration's stance on such issues as the environment, immigration, free speech and Russia. \nSome people raised signs that said \"Not My President,\" while others held up a large American flag. Protester Reg Brookings warned the crowd that Trump is trying to divide the country by making such groups as immigrants the enemy. \nA small but unruly group of protesters faced off with police in downtown Portland, Oregon. \nThe Oregonian/OregonLive reports (http://bit.ly/2lfx6xL) the police confronted the crowd in front of the Edith Green-Wendell Wyatt Federal Building. Police took some people into custody. \nHundreds of Trump opponents and supporters turned out in Rapid City, South Dakota. \nA larger anti-Trump faction stood on a street corner as part of a \"Not My President\" protest, similar to other demonstrations being held across the country. A group supporting the president lined up on a different corner at the same intersection. \n___ \nWalker reported from New York City.
