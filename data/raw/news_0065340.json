It plans to eventually handle 300 million to 400 million tons of cargo a year. \nForget India, profit from ‘quiet rise’ of Pakistan: Barron’s Asia \nIt also aims to develop seafood processing plants in a nearby free trade zone sprawled over 923 hectares (2,281 acres). \nThe route through Gwadar offers China its shortest path to the oil-rich Middle East, Africa, and most of the Western hemisphere, besides promising to open up remote, landlocked Xinjiang. \nLast year, the Applied Economics Research Centre estimated the corridor would create 700,000 jobs in Pakistan and a Chinese newspaper recently put the number at more than 2 million. \nAuthorities have completed an expressway through Gwadar, which has a 350-km (218-mile) road network. A new international airport kicks off next year, to handle an influx of hundreds of Chinese traders and officials expected to live near the port. \nThe volume of Gwadar property searches surged 14-fold on Pakistan’s largest real estate database, Zameen.com, between 2014 and 2016, up from a prior rate of a few hundred a month. \n“It’s like a gold rush,” said Chief Executive Zeeshan Ali Khan. “Anyone who is interested in real estate, be it an investor or a developer, is eyeing Gwadar.” \nPrices, which have risen two- to four-fold on average, are climbing “on a weekly basis,” said Saad Arshed, the managing director of online real estate marketplace Lamudi.pk. \nRegional fishermen have held strikes during the last two years, to protest against being displaced by the port. \nTo keep pace with the interest, urban officials are struggling to computerise land management and record-keeping. “We are trying to upgrade as fast as we can,” said Zakir Majeed, an official of the Gwadar Development Authority (GDA). \nBut Gwadar lacks basic education and health facilities, in contrast to the gleaming towers and piped drinking water of the “smart city” envisioned by the GDA. \n“For commercial projects, things are moving fast,” Lamudi’s Arshed said. “But people actually living there, that will take a long time.” \nPort officials expect the population to hit 2 million over the next two decades, from about 185,000 now. \nRisk \nThe government commissioned work on the Gwadar port in 2002, but development was held up by chronic instability in the surrounding resource-rich province of Balochistan. \nSince China announced the corridor plan in 2014, security has improved, with government setting up a new army division to ensure protection, while hundreds of rebels surrendered arms. \nReal estate firms dismiss fears the “Gwadar bubble” might still burst, pointing to China’s enduring interest. \n“The risk is always there,” Rafi said. “But our confidence comes from knowing this is not a Pakistani initiative, but a Chinese city on the Arabian Sea coast. And the Chinese will see that it is built.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:36:07.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
