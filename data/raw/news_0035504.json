(Mark Gonzales/Chicago Tribune) \nCubs manager Joe Maddon on Kyle Schwarber, Javier Baez, the \"That's Cub\" slogan and future gimmicks at spring training on Feb. 14, 2017. (Mark Gonzales/Chicago Tribune) Paul Sullivan manager Joe Maddon wondered aloud if there was a statute of limitations on bringing mimes into the clubhouse.\n\"Can you do a mime two years in a row?\" Maddon asked during his debut news conference in Mesa. \"I don't know if that's permissible. Under MLB rules somewhere, I don't think you can bring a mime back.\" \nNew season, new Cubs, same old Joe. \nThe boys were back in town, at least the pitchers and catchers, and Maddon's wild rumpus was starting anew \nThe world champions opened camp Tuesday under sunny skies in Arizona with great expectations and most of the same cast of characters who changed the way people think about an organization synonymous with failure. \nLovable losers no more, the 2017 Cubs are suddenly the gold standard for success in baseball, believe it or not. They have created the perfect recipe for building a winner from scratch, starting with shrewd drafting and deft deal-making, adding in a few quality free-agent signings and a couple of character guys, and bringing in a cerebral manager who keeps pressure off everyone in the dugout while satiating fans and media alike. \nPresident Theo Epstein may have been the architect of the Cubs' championship season, but Maddon served as the celebrity chef, constantly stirring the pot from the wacky spring training routines through the epic Game 7 of the World Series in Cleveland. \nPhotos of Joe Maddon, the 2015 NL Manager of the Year. \nSo what's new for the Cubs in 2017? \nWill Maddon stay the course, or look for new methods to get to the promised land? \n\"Nothing has changed, man,\" Maddon said Tuesday, flanked by Epstein and general manager Jed Hoyer at the opening press briefing. \"I mean, it's all the same in regards to the same, meaning the methods, the process. … I just got aired out upstairs by one of our sports geek guys for not using the word 'process.' It's true.\" \nRest assured Maddon will continue to preach about the \"process,\" though whether he will repeat his vaunted \"Cheech & Chong\" skit — donning a tie-dye T-shirt and driving out onto the practice field in what former President Barack Obama referred to as Maddon's \"shaggin' wagon\" — remains to be seen. \n\"Our process shall remain the same, absolutely it shall,\" Maddon said. \"Hopefully we're going to add or augment it in some ways that can be even more interesting, entertaining. I don't know.\" \nFifteen weeks after embarking on their endless celebration, the Cubs enter spring training as defending World Series champions for the first time since 1909. \nHere are nine issues they face in Arizona this spring. (Mark Gonzales) \nLast year's theme heading into spring training was \"Embrace the Target,\" a nod to the consensus view that the 2016 Cubs were favorites to win the World Series. \nMission accomplished. \nThis year's buzzwords include \"uncomfortable,\"\"authentic\" and the new saying, \"That's Cub,\" a reference to the organization's insistence on playing the game the right way. \nMany of the same experts who called the Cubs' 2016 title, including the oddsmakers in Las Vegas, are predicting a repeat, similar to the one the Cubs pulled off in 1907 and '08 before the century of regress turned them into late-night talk show punch lines. \nUnequivocally, it's World Series or bust now, with three of the game's top starters in Jon Lester, Jake Arrieta and Kyle Hendricks, the reigning National League and World Series' Most Valuable Player in Kris Bryant , a slew of All-Stars including Anthony Rizzo and Ben Zobrist, and emerging stars in Kyle Schwarber, Javier Baez and Willson Contreras. \nConfidence in the Cubs is as overwhelming as the sweet smell emanating from the Blommer Chocolate Company on Kinzie, and it's becoming an epidemic everywhere but on the South Side. #TrueFact. \nCubs and White Sox pitchers and catchers report to spring training next week. In case you missed it, here are each team's most significant additions and subtractions from the offseason. (Chris Sosa) \nIt's a heady feeling for the generations of Cubs' fans who grew up expecting things to go wrong at the most inopportune time, a belief based on actual events that need not be mentioned here, or in polite company, ever again. \nIf the Cubs keep dominating, sooner or later their fans may even stop mentioning Maddon's maneuverings in Game 7, which led to the gut-punching, game-tying home run off Aroldis Chapman that reminded us again of what it felt like in 1969, 1984 and 2003. \nMaddon took numerous vocal shots as his overuse of Chapman was brought up again and again, even though the end result made the move irrelevant. \n\"I know, and it's coming up again right now,\" Maddon said Tuesday, prompting laughs from the jammed media room at the Cubs' facility. \nUh, sorry Joe. \nBut does Maddon think the Game 7 criticism ever will go away? \n\"It doesn't matter,\" he said. \"Stuff like that doesn't bother me at all. I've talked about it before. In that game, regardless of what people may have thought, like any other game that I worked all year long, I had it planned out like that before the game began. So it wasn't anything I tried to do differently game in progress. \n\"Had I not done what I thought I was supposed to do, then I would've second-guessed myself. So, no, I have no problem with that. I really don't mind the second-guessing from anybody. I kind of encourage it. \nPhotos as the Cubs arrive at spring training in Mesa, Ariz., on Feb. 13, 2017. \n\"Please go ahead and do it because I'll take that kind of second-guessing after winning a World Series on an annual basis, thank you very much.\" \nOf course, Chapman himself contributed to the saga when he threw Maddon under the bus after he re-signed with the Yankees , saying his former manager had \"abused\" him. Maddon said the two spoke about \"stuff\" at the White House ceremony, where Chapman gave him a warm hug. \n\"There might have been something lost in the translation,\" Maddon said, trying to take Chapman off the hook. \nNo matter. Life goes on. Chapman is gone, the parade is over and the wall outside Wrigley Field has been power-blasted clean of the names of deceased Cubs fans written in colored chalk. \nSpring training is time for everyone to sweep out the old and embrace the promise of a new season. \nLast year was \"the Year\" Cubs' fans have been waiting for their entire lives. It was just as fun as everyone dreamed it would be. \nNow everyone is on bonus points, so just enjoy the ride. \npsullivan@chicagotribune.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:40:45.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
