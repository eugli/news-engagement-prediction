After all, if some space creature is going to make its business the deaths of the crew members you're watching on the screen, you're going to want to relate to them before they meet such an untimely death. To a certain extent, the franchise moved away from such moments with each passing film, at least until Prometheus brought some of that spark back to the world of Xenomorphs and man.
