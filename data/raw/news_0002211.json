I think along with Auntie Anne's, those are the traditional national tenants people like and expect to see within a mall. This is another example of the increasing vitality of Spring Hill.\" \nA post on Spring Hill Mall's Facebook page said Cinnabon will be located in Center Court. \n\"And the more traditional sit-down food uses are going to be moved outside,\" Nelson said. \"Those are going to be coming online in the next 12 to 18 months.\" \nThe next-closest Cinnabon location is in Schaumburg's Woodfield Mall. \nSpring Hill Mall is in the midst of a nearly $40 million renovation project. In December, the new 37,000-square-foot Cinemark theater opened in the former J.C. Penney wing. Last fall, Rouse announced H&M will be among the retailers set to open once work is completed. \nErin Sauder is a freelance reporter for The Courier-News.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:56:05.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
