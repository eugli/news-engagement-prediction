MUST READ \nMallika is said to be a huge fan of late AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa and was desperate to meet her during her 2014 prison term. \nInterestingly, the AIADMK leader too shared a cordial relationship with 'Cyanide Mallika.' \nThe report quoted jail authorities as saying that Mallika used to help Sasikala by bringing food for her in the prison. \nAs prisoner no 9234, Sasikala shares 10 feet by 8 feet cell, with a bathroom separated by a wall, with her sister-in-law Illavarasi in Parappana Agrahara central prison. \n'Cyanide' Mallika was arrested in 2008. She used to identify rich women visiting Bengaluru temples, befriended them and killed them using cyanide before decamping with their jewellery. \nHindalga jail - one of the oldest prisons in the country - houses several death row convicts and terror case accused.
