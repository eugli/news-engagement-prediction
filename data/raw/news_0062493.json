By SportsDayDFW.com Contact SportsDayDFW.com on Twitter: @SportsDayDFW \nHere are some of Dak Prescott's best quotes of his rookie season with the Dallas Cowboys. \"[Tony] Romo wins and I win. That's the biggest thing you can take from the quarterback position.\" \nContext : The rookie was expected to sit behind Tony Romo this season after the Cowboys drafted him in the fourth round with the 135th overall pick. His selection made him the third quarterback team owner Jerry Jones had made since 2001 (joining Quincy Carter and Stephen McGee). \nWe'll say one thing about the quote: he was spot on. His 13 wins tied for the most in a rookie season with Ben Roethlisberger. \nClick/tap here to read more from a profile on Prescott by SportsDay's Brandon George . \" Trust me, I love my job, but it's 100 percent work.\" \nContext : This quote comes from a texting conversation Prescott had with his older brother, Tad. Here's what it looked like: \nTad: What are you doing? 'Tony Romo wins and I win'; why you should bet on Cowboys' unapologetic mama's boy Dak Prescott \nDak: I just left work. \nTad: You just left work, Lol \nDak: Yeah, I just left work. What would you call it? \nTad: I would call it living the dream. \nDak: Trust me, I love my job, but it's 100 percent work. \nCan you think of a better summary of his rookie season? He came in, earned the starting job after Romo suffered his injury and never gave it back. \nClick/tap here to read more from a profile on Prescott by SportsDay's Brandon George . \"Nobody's ever going to tell me this is my team. ... this is everybody's team. \" \nContext : This came right after Tony Romo's emotional speech where he said Prescott had \"earned the right to be our quarterback.\" Romo would accept the backup job in the same press conference. \nThe quote above is how Prescott responded. Much like Romo, he put the team first. \n\"[Romo has] been a great leader, a great model for me to look up to and watch every day,\" Prescott said . \"It's an emotional statement for him to come out and say that. But I'm not surprised. I know how much he cares about this game ... what it means to him, how much he puts into it every day and what this team means to him.\" \"She'd probably just be crying.\" MSU QB Dak Prescott with his mom, Peggy Prescott. submitted by the family in December of 2012. \nContext : Before his first NFL game Prescott said his late mother would get a text Saturday night before the Cowboys played the Giants . His mom, Peggy Prescott, died in 2013 after a year-long battle with colon cancer. \nPrescott was given the No. 10 when the Cowboys took him in the fourth round of the April draft. He requested that it be changed to No. 4 in memory of his mother's Sept. 4 birthday. \n\"This weekend was a special day kind of a day,\" Prescott said. \"I really don't do much. I just kinda chill. Think about her. Think about her good memories, things like that.\" \nPeggy Prescott didn't get to see her son become the first quarterback other than Tony Romo to open the regular season for the Cowboys in 10 years. But Dak said he knew what would've happened if she could be there against the New York Giants. \n\"She'd probably just be crying,\" Prescott said. \"She was emotional. We always used to get on her about crying so she'd just be crying with a big smile on her face.\" \"Your father, he is watching you.\" \nContext : Stats don't always tell the whole story. \nThis year's Cowboys team was so good because of how close all of the players were. That was shown when Dallas faced Pittsburgh this year. The day before the two teams met Dez Bryant's father, MacArthur Hatton, died of an undisclosed illness. \nDez's biggest play came late in the third quarter with the Cowboys at midfield, looking at third-and-11, trailing 18-16. Facing single coverage, like he did for most of the game, Bryant sprinted past Pittsburgh rookie cornerback Artie Burns down the left sideline. After losing his dad, Dez gets help from football family — especially Dak, who lost his mom — on emotional day \nRookie quarterback Dak Prescott avoided pressure before stepping up and unleashing a 50-yard bomb. Bryant juggled the ball for a second before securing it and crossing the goal line. \nBryant paused for a second in the back of the end zone, pointed to the sky and then blew a kiss. Tears started to flow as he fell to his knees. Several teammates consoled him. \nOne of those players was Prescott, who said he talked to Bryant earlier in the day about what he's been through since his mother's death. \n\"Your father, he is watching you,\" Prescott told Bryant. \"He's got the best seat in the house. I told him to go out there and honor him today. And Dez did exactly that.\" \"I think that chip on my shoulder grew the moment they passed on me.\" \nContext : The Cowboys-Browns matchup wasn't the most entertaining of the season. Dallas won 35-10 and the Browns fell to 0-9. But that doesn't mean that Prescott wasn't motivated to play Cleveland. \nEvery team in the NFL passed on Prescott. That includes the Cowboys. But Cleveland passed on him eight times, a number that was brought to his attention. \n\"I think that chip on my shoulder grew the moment they passed on me,\" Prescott said of the Browns and every other team that passed on him. \"I don't necessarily bring it up each week.\" \"It was more important for me to spend time with my family than to do those deals.\" \nContext : Prescott's sudden fame comes with its perks. Like being offered to appear on late night television. Too bad for the TV networks that he was more interested in spending time with his family instead during Dallas' bye week. \n\"I haven't seen my grandmother in a long time, so I'm going to do that and get away from it,\" the rookie quarterback said at the time. Cowboys QB Dak Prescott says no to late-night talk show, opts to visit grandma and do some fishing \nThere were other options. One of the late-night talk shows -- Prescott doesn't remember which -- wanted to fly him out for an interview. He even had an opportunity outside the country. \nThat was a definite no. \nAppearances and endorsements can wait until the offseason. \n\"It was more important for me to spend time with my family than to do those deals,\" Prescott said. \"Those deals will be there. If they really want it bad enough, they'll find a way.\" \nNot only does he get family time, it sounds as if he's driving up the price when he agrees to do something later. Prescott laughed. \n\"Exactly,\" he said. \"I'm like, gosh. I just blew my first pass to Jason Witten.\" Ashley Landis/Staff Photographer Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten (82) celebrates a touchdown with quarterback Dak Prescott (4) and guard Zack Martin (70) during the first quarter of their game against the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, November 6, 2016 at FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. (Ashley Landis/The Dallas Morning News) \nContext : How anxious was Prescott to meet his teammates? He said Bryant was one of the first teammates to introduce himself. Here's what Prescott said of first meeting Jason Witten: \n\"We're just throwing a deep ball to the guys, over the shoulder, it looks all pretty and glamorous,\" Prescott said. \"And it's supposed to be easy. But it's my first time throwing to Jason Witten. At this point I'm like, ah I'm nervous. Like I've got to hit Jason Witten's stride. \n\"So I throw the ball. It wasn't as tight of spirals as it should have been. And Jason, I think if he sticks his hands all the way out, he catches the ball. But I guess this was his moment of showing me how detailed and how precise this league is. And how precise I need to be in everything that I do. And he simply just watches the ball go over his shoulder and fall. And at this moment, my heart just drops. \n\" I'm like, gosh. I just blew my first pass to Jason Witten.\" \"Go ahead, doubt me. I'll just work harder.\" \nContext : This quote appears in a commercial featuring Prescott. Seems to sum up his entire career so far, no? — Dak Prescott (@dak) December 16, 2016 \"Yeah you women need a lot of time. And my time is focused on football right now -- my first love.\" \nContext : That was Dak's response to a question about his dating life. \"The Cowboys, they got lucky.\" \nContext : Prescott said this while accepting the Associated Press' Offensive Rookie of the Year award at the NFL Honors show. \nThe QB had a couple of good zingers while on stage. From SportsDay's David Moore : Dak Prescott thanks 32 teams for passing on him after winning Rookie of Year: 'The Cowboys, they got lucky' \nElliott, wearing a red sport coat (minus the croptop look), used his \"feed me\" gesture to greet Beckham before Prescott grabbed the mic. \n\"Do we have a knife so we can cut this in half?\" Prescott asked a crowd of his peers. \nPrescott went on to thank the Cowboys' offensive line - calling them the \"great wall\" - and ended his speech with a zinger: \n\"And thank you to the 31 teams for passing up on me.\" \nPrescott, a late fourth-round pick by the Cowboys a year ago, was later asked about his parting shot before leaving the stage. \n\"Actually 32 teams passed up on me three times,\" he said, smiling. \"The Cowboys, they got lucky.\" This Topic is Missing Your Voice.
