(Susan Walsh / AP) Tribune news services made an unsupported assertion Monday that terrorist acts in Europe are going unreported. A look at the matter:\nTRUMP: \"All over Europe it's happening. It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.\" THE FACTS \nTrump and his team have cited only one example of a deadly terrorist attack anywhere going unreported, the one that didn't happen in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Adviser Kellyanne Conway spoke about a Bowling Green \"massacre\" that didn't take place, correcting herself when she was called out on the error. \nAs for Trump's claim about Europe, it's probably true that you haven't heard of every attack on the continent that can be tied to terrorism. Scores if not hundreds happen every year. Many don't rise to the level of an international audience because they cause no casualties, or little or no property damage, or are carried out by unknown assailants for unclear reasons.
