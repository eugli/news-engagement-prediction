It can forecast demand for rides with 20% or less error more than 90% of the time, according to Docomo. \nFor the field trials, 12 drivers used tablets updated every 10 minutes with ridership predictions to decide where to go to find waiting customers. Daily business rose 20% thanks to the information, a participant said. \nDocomo said it is thinking to commercialize the technology as early as the second half of fiscal 2017. \nThis is an example of how AI is starting to find applications in everyday life, beyond specialized areas like drug discovery. \nAnother is a system that can predict how late trains will come after accidents occur. Fujitsu plans to market it starting in the first half of fiscal 2017 to providers of transportation information services. \n(Nikkei)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T12:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:08:51.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
