We’re paying you half-a-million dollars to buy your home game.” \nThe AFL’s only statement on the dispute has come through league executive Travis Auld who has repeatedly stated that Gold Coast is the home team for the match. The Gold Coast Suns and Port Adelaide will clash in Shanghai, China in Round 8. Source: Supplied \nGold Coast chairman Tony Cochrane told The Advertiser there was no written agreement regarding which teams would wear the respective guernseys. \nCochrane didn’t back down from Koch’s threat to have Gold Coast never again invited to China either, stating “the AFL — not Koch — has full responsibility for the league calendar.” \nGold Coast also argued it has brought cache to the match commercially. Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Steven Ciobo was at the AFL’s announcement in Shanghai that Tourism Australia would finance the game. Ciobo is the federal member for Moncrieff, an electorate on the Gold Coast. \n“We’ve used our marketing power too, particularly when China ranks at No. 1 in the Queensland tourism market,” Cochrane told The Advertiser .
