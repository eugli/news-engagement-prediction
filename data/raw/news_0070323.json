'We don't want people to go through what we have' \nOne of those survivors is Rebecca Waight, who lost her husband to depression in 2015. \nLike Ms Steenhuis, Ms Waight's partner had not shown any signs he was struggling with his mental health. \nIt is a commonality that prompted the duo to expand the initiative and take the conversation to a community that had never been asked to listen. External Link: Let's Talk \nIt started out simply — by making their presence known. \n\"We had a stall set up at a local event, and a bloke kept walking past and stopping to suss us out,\" Ms Waight said. \n\"After a while, he built up the courage to approach us, and pulled an old photo out of his wallet. \n\"It was of his best friend, who had committed suicide over 30 years ago [but] he wasn't just carrying that photo around with him every day, he was carrying that grief as well.\" \nTogether, and with the support of a group of dedicated volunteers, the pair are now establishing a crisis and support centre in the Ballarat region. \n\"We don't want people to go through what we went through,\" Ms Waight said. \n\"Suicide is 100 per cent preventable. That's the issue, it is preventable, we just need to be able to talk about it.\" Let's Talk is Sam's legacy \nAbout 150 kilometres outside Ballarat, in Victoria's far south-west, is the tiny dairy farming town of Ellerslie. \nIt has a population of about 250 people, but you would struggle to find a more close-knit community. \nSo when Sam Fitzgibbon, a popular 21-year-old Country Fire Authority (CFA) volunteer took his own life last year, it sent shockwaves through the region.

(Supplied: Jane Fitzgibbon) \nUnfortunately, it was not an isolated occurrence. \nOver the past 12 months, the regional shires of Corangamite, Warrnambool and Moyne — that take in Ellerslie — have recorded 16 suicides. \nIt prompted Sam's mum, Jane to reach out to John Parkinson, a mental health manager at St John of God's Hospital in Warrnambool, to help put a halt to the harrowing statistic. \n\"We started out by talking to the local football clubs about depression and [about] recognising the signs because there weren't other services coming out to our communities at that point,\" Ms Fitzgibbon said. \nAlmost inexplicably, the initiative spread by word-of-mouth, leading to a powerful grassroots movement called Let's Talk. \nIts aim is just that — to get people talking about their mental health — and Mr Parkinson and Ms Fitzgibbon are now hosting forums across the region, in schools, sporting clubs and the local pubs. \n\"Feeling anxious, feeling stressed, not feeling well — they are all the signs we need to be aware of,\" Mr Parkinson said. \n\"We want the community to take responsibility for this.\" \nThe pair is determined to take the conversation to as many towns across the region as are prepared to listen, and are currently working to encourage a uniform mental health curriculum in schools. \n\"Our legacy for Sam, and others like Sam, is that any parent would do anything for their child,\" Ms Fitzgibbon said. \n\"So Let's Talk is about trying to reduce the fact that this continues.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:15:03.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
