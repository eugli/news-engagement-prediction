North Korean agents are suspected of masterminding the attack . Photo A silk mill in Pyongyang this week. North Korea has a cash-starved economy that could suffer from Beijing’s decision to cut off coal imports. Credit Ed Jones/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The disclosure that a chemical weapon banned under international treaties was used in the attack is sure to put more pressure on China’s relations with North Korea, which some Chinese analysts say are at their lowest point since the founding of the North as a separate country after World War II. The disclosure “makes things worse,” Mr. Cheng said. “It’s wrong to kill the half brother. It’s more wrong to have used banned chemical agents.” \n  Earlier this month, the North issued a more indirect takedown of Beijing in its government newspaper Minju Joson, signaling a growing rift. Shortly afterward, China announced the suspension of coal imports. The burst of criticisms from Pyongyang — coupled with Beijing’s coal ban — suggested boiling tensions between China’s president, Xi Jinping , 63, who sees himself as a global leader, and Mr. Kim, 33, an eccentric dictator. Mr. Xi is said to have low regard for Mr. Kim, who has not visited China and is not known to have been invited. Despite past periods of turbulence, including under Mao Zedong, both sides have more or less tried to preserve a polite public veneer of amity. But the friendship was a myth, said Shen Zhihua, a professor of history at East China Normal University. Photo The view from the landmark Juche Tower in Pyongyang last week. The rift between China and North Korea has emerged as the United States has pushed for Beijing to do more to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions.

An editorial in Global Times, a state-run tabloid that sometimes reflects the thinking of senior government officials, noted on Friday that the suspension of coal imports was “fair” and in keeping with United Nations sanctions.
