It comes from a Philly band Updated: February 1, 2017 — 4:45 PM EST 49 Share A.D. Amorosi FOR THE INQUIRER \nBy now you’ve seen the brand new, black-and-white Apple ad for its iPhone + AirPods that does as much for its product as it does the music behind it (if you haven't, check it out above). \n“Play Marian Hill ,” is the first (and only) phrase uttered in the bright, prancing commercial, followed by a subtle robotic beat, a twitchy piano, a whistling electronic ambience and the softly skittering voice of Samantha Gongol – the sound of that duo’s 2016 tune “Down,” from its debut album, Act One . \nIt’s no surprise then with that sort of showcase that “Down,” long outside the Top 200, immediately jumped into iTunes’ single sales chart at No. 12 after the commercial’s Jan. 14 debut, rising to No. 8 this week with Act One currently at No. 7 – all on the heels of Marian Hill’s release of “Back to Me” this week, a high profile duet with Fifth Harmony’s Lauren Jauregui. \nPretty good for Samantha Gongol and Jeremy Lloyd: two childhood friends who met at Haverford High School and named their jazzily electronic songwriting-singing-production duo after two characters from The Music Man (Marian Paroo and Harold Hill). \n“That’s the theater geek in us,” says Lloyd who, after high school, studied music theatre at Yale University while Gongol split for Manhattan and music business courses at New York University. Marian Hill’s occasional third is experimental saxophonist Steve Davit (a Drexel University music industry major) whose smoky, supple subtone gives Marian Hill’s already bluesy, jazzy vibe greater heft. “He’s our secret weapon,” says Gongol of Davit. \nLike any lifelong pals, Gongol and Lloyd — both 26 — each anticipate what the other will say, finish each other’s sentences and talk quickly over each other while doing so. “We had classes, together in middle and high school,” says Gongol. “There was Seventh Heaven choir, rehearsal mornings at 7 a.m.,” says Lloyd. \nEven as Main Line kids, they wrote songs, but not together. While Gongol was more the waifish singer-songwriter type (“I wasn’t very good,” she says, laughing), Lloyd balanced himself between penning his own show tunes and acting, and creating a studio production aesthetic (“in a very amateur way, slowly getting better,” he says). Gongol was a fixture on Ardmore’s open mic scene, North Star Bar and World Café Live, with Lloyd joining her for the latter open mics. When the two friends got together for Marian Hill, it was his home studio vision and their merging of styles – with a shared love of jazz and blues – that turned the two-some inwards to a sound that, though it has references, is without easy categorization. \n“That’s the highest praise, as that is what we were going for,” he says of songs like their first co-written/recorded song, the blues-hoppy “Whiskey,” in March 2013. “I think being in theater heightens the drama of the song with its lyrics always going under intense scrutiny,” says Lloyd. “They have to be about something. And Sam’s voice has to be clear and upfront.” \nWith “Whiskey” recorded, Marian Hill began uploading it onto music blogs and SoundClouds, with EPs such as Play to follow in 2013, the latter co-starring Davit and his sax. \n“I’ve known Steve longer than I know Sam,” says Lloyd. \n“He’s amazing, especially as we’re about the organic and the improvisational as well as cutting things up in the studio,\" adds Gongol. \n“Whiskey” got the band internet attention, management, PR representation and finally, after the release of another EP, Sway , the Universal label, who would release Act One . “Our fans ate it up, but it didn’t expand our base,” says Lloyd pragmatically. \nBy 2016’s end, the pair seemed quizzical about what would come next for Marian Hill. “We had buzz, but no plans,” says Gongol. They played fests such as Bonnaroo, received good reviews from the New York Times and appeared on The Late Late Show with James Corden , but Act One stalled on the charts. Enter Apple and iPhone + AirPods. \nGongol, Lloyd, management and label cannot discuss the minutiae of the Apple deal or how the multimedia giant came to them and their music. \n“What we can say is that we couldn’t have asked for a better opportunity; not only the exposure during high-profile television events like football games, but the fact that the look of the commercial is so in tune with our aesthetic,\" says Lloyd, of the ad. \n“It’s so rewarding to see something done so well connected to who we are as musicians,” adds Gongol. “Everything else – the iTunes sales, and all other opportunities coming our way – is gravy.” \nBoth Lloyd and Gongol note that their lives haven’t changed radically as yet due to Apple, but it feels as if a tidal wave is approaching with deals and tour showcases in the offing for spring. Having a new single, “Back to Me,” on the charts in tandem with Jauregui certainly helps the momentum. \n“Between the ad and this single, we no longer feel as if we pushing a boulder up a hill, by ourselves,” says Gongol. \n“There’s a lot of help with that boulder,” adds Lloyd.
