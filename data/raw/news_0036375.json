Trump just asked a black journalist if she was \"friends\" with the Congressional Black Caucus and wanted to set up a mtg for him w/ the CBC. pic.twitter.com/whnDJLI8MI — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:10:22.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
