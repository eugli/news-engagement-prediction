TRAPPIST-1 has been named after The Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope (TRAPPIST) in Chile. TRAPPIST-1 is nothing like the sun. It is classified as an ultra-cool dwarf, because it is so cool that liquid water could survive on planets orbiting very close to it, closer than is possible on planets in our solar system. The star has a temperature of 2550 K and is at least 500 million years old. It has the ability to live for up to 4â€“5 trillion years. TRAPPIST-1 is rich in metal, with a metallicity of 0.04, or 109% the solar amount. The faint star is only 11% of the diameter of the Sun and is much redder in colour. \nCheck out TRAPPIST-1's planetary system below: \n(Image courtesy: Wikipedia)   10:27 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:25:34.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
