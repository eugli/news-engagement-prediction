A panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court judge's decision to issue a temporary injunction of the immigration order while lawsuits percolate.\n\"What the judges did, both at the 9th and the district level, was to take power for themselves that belongs squarely in the hands of the president,\" White House senior adviser Stephen Miller said Sunday on NBC .\nSubscribe today to get intelligence and analysis on defense and national security issues in your Inbox each weekday morning from veteran journalists Jamie McIntyre and Jacqueline Klimas.\n  the Daily on Defense newsletter.   issue soon! Trump's team suspended for 90 days almost all travel from seven countries listed in a 2015 federal law as \"countries of concern\" due to the strength of terrorist movements in the area and the inability of local governments to provide biographical information on its citizens. That law was passed primarily out fear that individuals might travel from Europe to join the Islamic State, then return from the Islamic State to a European country whose citizens can travel to the United States without a visa.\nSchumer said the order encourages \"lone wolves\" and argued that Trump should scrutinize the visa-free travel from U.S. allied countries. \"It is very easy to come to America from countries that we have always regarded as friendly,\" he said. \"But these days, there are would-be terrorists who have infiltrated places like Belgium and France. And they can come into this country much more easily than someone who is a refugee from the seven countries the president mentioned. That needs real tightening up.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:57:03.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
