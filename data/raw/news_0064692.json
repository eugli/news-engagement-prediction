How does hourly billing work? All services are billed automatically at the end of the month. You are charged the hourly rate for a service up to its monthly cap. You may receive a mid-month bill from Linode if you reach a certain threshold of Linode services used within a single month. If my Linode is powered off, will I be billed? Yes. We maintain your saved data and reserve your ability to use other resources like RAM, transfer, etc. even when your Linode is powered off. You will be billed for any other active Linode service, such as Longview Pro or an extra IP, as well. What plan should I choose? If you're not sure, we recommend that you start small and work your way up. You can resize your Linode up or down at any time, so there's no pressure. What forms of payment do you accept? We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. You can add credit to your account by transferring funds from a PayPal account. You will still need to sign up using a credit card when transferring from PayPal. What happens if I exceed my monthly transfer quota? You will be invoiced $0.02 for each GB over your pooled network transfer quota. Please note that all inbound traffic is free and will not count against your quota. Do you offer a trial period? Yes! If you're unsatisfied for any reason, you can cancel your account within the first seven days and request a full refund, no questions asked. Still have a question about billing? Ask us! We're here to help, 24/7. Get started in the Linode Cloud. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T08:03:18.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
