I'm in this world without a lady I would call mom.\"\nHer son fears Murphy was let down by the medical system.\n\"When symptoms and everything started to get worse… did she have anywhere to call? I don't feel so,\" Grimeau said.\nThe questions about Murphy's care come as the Fraser Health Authority and B.C. Coroners Service investigate a similar-sounding incident involving a three-year-old girl .\nNimrat Gill's family checked her into hospital on Feb. 6, only to be told to take the little girl home and treat her with over-the-counter painkillers.\nThey brought her back the next day after her condition worsened, and she died shortly after in hospital. Tests have since confirmed she was suffering from pneumonia, according to the family.\n\"What I'm hoping is that these are two very isolated incidents that happen to be temporally related,\" said Dr. Roy Morton, vice-president of medicine for Fraser Health. \"That's what our further investigation will try to sort through to determine.\"\nMorton told CTV News the information he’s received is that Murphy was pain-free when she was discharged from hospital.\nThe health authority is not currently investigating Murphy’s case, however. Officials said they only learned of her death from the coroner this week, and a probe could still be launched.\nThe B.C. Coroners Service is investigating both incidents. The agency said it's intention is not to find fault, but to come up with recommendations aimed at helping prevent future deaths in similar circumstances.\nWith files from CTV Vancouver's Scott Hurst   \nRelated Stories Coroner investigating after girl sent home by hospital dies on second visit to ER Photos Mary Louise Murphy, 56, died a day after being discharged from Abbotsford Regional Hospital.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:31:43.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
