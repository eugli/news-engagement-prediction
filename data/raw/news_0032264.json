Taxpayers first balked when they found out there would be a toll to travel along it.\nA total of $845 million in tolls were collected in the 22 years since the highway opened until the province stopped collecting them in 2008.\nAnd while some communities along the route saw the highway as a blessing, others that had once been regular stops for travellers saw their business nearly come to a halt.\nBudget overruns But the biggest criticism of the highway had to do with the millions of dollars in cost overruns that came with it.\nThe accusations intially surfaced after the first phase of the project, from Hope to Merritt, was completed in 1986.\nThe first two phases of the project were originally budgeted at $250 million, but ended up costing more than $400 million, according to archived reports at the time.\nThis video shows the opening of the first phase of the project, and the criticism that came with it:\nCoquihalla Highway opens amidst budget criticism 2:43\nCritics said the rush to construct the highway in time for Expo 86 had led to costly and inefficient work practices like laying asphalt on snow-covered ground — which critics said necessitated repairs shortly after the highway opened.\nAt first, Bill Bennett's government denied the budget overruns, but an inquiry later revealed the rush to construct the highway.\nCritics said the province had tried to deceive the public about how much the project would cost.\nBut officials at the time defended the highway and said, overall, taxpayers got a good deal on the project.\nThousands use Coquihalla daily Today, the Coquihalla sees upwards of 30,000 travellers per day during its busiest month, August.\nNearly one fourth of that traffic is trucks.\nThe route has been credited with kickstarting an economic boom in the Okanagan and southern Interior.\nBut as hours-long closures over the last few days indicate, the highway can still be a great source of frustration for many.\nThe province says the highway is most often closed because of \"vehicle incidents\" like stalls and trucks spinning out, followed by collisions and avalanche hazards.", "external_links": ["http://tranbc.ca/2015/03/16/how-well-do-you-know-the-coquihalla/"], "published": "2017-02-12T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:53:13.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
