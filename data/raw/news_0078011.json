Mr Miah was cleared of the charge. \nMr Justice Goss said there was a \"concerted attempt\" to tamper with the jury. \n\"Approaches [were] made to five [jurors] after they left court on Tuesday by at least two different people, one female and one or two males, to reach certain verdicts.\" \nMrs Laird died after the car she was in was in collision with a Volkswagen Passat on Old Lane in Beeston in September 2014. 'Unlawful act' \nOne of the Passat's passengers, Mohammed Ubaidullah, later pleaded guilty to manslaughter and conspiracy to commit fraud. \nHe told police the collision was not a genuine accident but part of a deliberate \"cash for crash\" scheme and said Sabir Hussain was the driver. \nSabir and Raja Hussain, who did not give evidence in the trial, said they were innocent passengers in the car, the collision was an accident and denied involvement in an insurance scam. \nMr Justice Goss said: \"There was a conspiracy to stage a crash for cash with a view to making fraudulent insurance claims.\" \nHe added that he could not be sure, on evidence, that Miah was in the car at the time of the collision and found him not guilty of manslaughter. \nUbaidullah, 29, of Ashton-under-Lyne, Sabir Hussain, 25, of Beeston, Leeds, Raja Hussain, 31, of Beeston, and Miah, 26, of Chadderton, Oldham, will be sentenced on Tuesday.
