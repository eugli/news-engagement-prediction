The red carpet is a great leveller, after all, and stars from privileged backgrounds will smile at the paparazzi alongside those who once struggled to survive as they waited for their big break. British award nominees such as Dev Patel and Hugh Grant, Emily Blunt and Naomie Harris, will share the limelight together, the contrasts in their paths to stardom now indistinguishable in the warm glow of fame.\nYet, statistically, we know that British actors who walk away with the top awards are more likely to have come from wealthier homes and to have been privately educated. Analysis by the Sutton Trust has uncovered a pattern of Bafta winners, with 42% educated at fee-paying independent schools, compared with just a quarter of winners drawn from the great majority of those who attended comprehensive schools.\nThe unsettling trend coincides with new unease in the industry about obstacles in the path of talented young people from outside the capital city or with parents who cannot afford to support them into adulthood.\n“It’s not enough being talented – these days you need cash,” said Steve Coogan , who went to drama school thanks largely to a state grant. The absence of public support, Coogan believes, means that it is now only “privileged actors who, as well as being talented, can go to drama school because they have family money to provide the cushion for them. So now we have a lot of dramas about privileged people played by privileged actors.”\nIn reaction to concern about one of the country’s most important economic sectors, the Labour party is using the glitz of tonight’s awards ceremony to draw fresh attention to the question of fairer access. A national inquiry, Acting Up – Breaking the Class Ceiling in the Performing Arts, is being set up to take a look at the backgrounds of successful performers and to develop a strategy to offer opportunities to a wider range of future stars. MPs Gloria De Piero and Tracy Brabin, a writer and former actor, have been asked to lead the inquiry by Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader and shadow secretary for culture.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Naomie Harris, who was nominated for Moonlight, is one of the few British stars who went to state schools.

It is just that we want to ensure similar chances for others,” said Brabin this weekend. “Most actors and writers need lots of practice to get good, as well as a sense of validation for their ambition. That is much harder from some backgrounds than others.”\nIf the American actors Viola Davis and Casey Affleck win tonight for their performance in Fences and Manchester by the Sea , questions of social class will be far from the minds of most viewers. Instead, Bafta will be justifiably proud that it has continued to do better at representing the racial diversity of cinema audiences. But if British stars win, the class divisions will be easier to spot.\nAmong homegrown talents up for this year’s awards, Emily Blunt , nominated as leading actress for Girl on a Train , Andrew Garfield, nominated as leading actor for Hacksaw Ridge , and Hugh Grant, nominated as supporting actor for Florence Foster Jenkins , were all privately educated. It is a divisive issue that enrages many actors; either because they think it irrelevant, or because they feel that a bias towards “posh” stars is excluding poorer young people from lucrative and creative careers.\nWhen the production line of actors leaving Eton , including Dominic West, Damian Lewis, Eddie Redmayne, Tom Hiddleston and Harry Lloyd, was first noticed, some commentators put it down to the galvanising influence of the school’s former drama teacher, Simon Dormandy, or to passing Hollywood fashion. Others saw it as a sign that acting was becoming a lifestyle choice for the financially advantaged.\nLewis, star of Homeland , Wolf Hall and current hit TV drama Billions , recently spoke out against the accusation that acting was a “closed shop” for the well-heeled.\n“The flaring up recently of this idea that it was unfair that people from private schools were getting acting jobs … a nonsense!” he complained to the Evening Standard , going on to admit his own intemperate response was a hangover from boarding at Ashdown House School. “I was eight and I loved it over the five years… But if you learn a mechanism that early to deal with situations that are foreign to you – trying to find your place within a group – you naturally suppress a lot of your own instincts.”\nWhatever emotions propelled Lewis from private school into acting, he is far from alone. A recent academic paper from the London School of Economics found more than half of those categorised as working actors in a national survey were from privileged backgrounds, while just 16% were from a working class background: this despite the fact that, statistically, a third of the population come from a working class background.\nFor Julie Hesmondhalgh, Hayley Cropper in Coronation Street, the high fees for drama training are the problem, while for Michelle Collins, best known as Cindy Beale from EastEnders, it is career networking that is the key. “If you are just a working class kid with a no frills background, really, what chance have you got?” she asked.\nAmong this year’s modest crop of British Bafta nominees, a few are state-educated: Spider-Man star, Tom Holland; Aaron Taylor-Johnson, nominated for Nocturnal Animals ; Lion supporting star, Dev Patel; and I, Daniel Blake ’s supporting actress Hayley Squires.\nCambridge graduate Naomie Harris, nominated for Moonlight , may play the pukka Miss Moneypenny in Bond films, but she went to state schools in London.\nBaftas 2017 The Observer Equality Theatre Steve Coogan Emily Blunt news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:52:57.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
