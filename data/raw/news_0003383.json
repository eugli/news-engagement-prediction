Keeping her beauty regimen simplistic meant the blonde beauty could best flaunt her stunning natural good looks. A smudge of liquid and pencil eyeliner drew out her dazzling eyes while she slicked her pout with a bold pink lip stain. Her honeyed tresses were styled into an elegant chignon, which meant her bust and slender shoulders were displayed to maximum effect. Hot look: Dianna, who joined a bevy of stars in helping launch the fragrance by the fashion giant, while ensuring she gave a nod to the designer by slipping into a Christian Dior gown The blonde beauty's ensemble was no doubt instantly recognisable to eagle-eyed fashion fans as Bella Hadid was spotted in the same gown just a week before. Supermodel Bella opted for the dress in a grey colour, as she went slightly more risque when she flashed her entire chest through the sheer cups. She too was attending a Dior event when she wore the dress, as she attended the Christian Dior Haute Couture Spring Summer 2017 Bal Masque during PFW. Natural beauty: As she flounced into the bash, Dianna sported a stunning and complementary monochrome coat with an exaggerated white collar and black body Perky in pink: A smudge of liquid and pencil eyeliner drew out her dazzling eyes while she slicked her pout with a bold pink lip stain Dianna celebrated her three-month wedding anniversary to husband Winston Marshall earlier this month. She was recently spotted without her new husband Winston, best known as the banjoist in the Grammy Award-winning British folk rock band Mumford & Sons. The lovebirds - who became engaged in December 2015 - were first seen out together in Paris during the summer before and have remained inseparable since. Dianna tied the knot with Marshall last year in a lavish ceremony at a far-flung Moroccan resort in October, complete with a Valentino gown and an elite guest list. Hot stuff!
