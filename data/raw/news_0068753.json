Fame Flynet 5 Wayne Rooney is on the verge of leaving Manchester United \nSunSport understands Stretford flew to China a few days ago and spent time in Tianjin, home of Tianjin Quanjian. \nHe checked out of the Renaissance Hotel in the city on Tuesday and is believed to be holding talks with other possible suitors. \nWhen contacted by SunSport on Monday, a spokesman for Tianjin Quanjian said “We have no official news about Wayne Rooney at this stage.” \nThe club’s manager Fabio Cannavaro admitted he had approached Rooney.

PA Rooney’s agent Paul Stretford is in China to continue negotiations Reuters Rooney trains with Ashley Young at Manchester United’s Carrington base on Tuesday Manchester United star Rooney misses Europa League trip to St Etienne due to injury \nBut talks stalled after he decided the England star, 31, did not suit the club’s style of play. \nOne club offered Stretford a three-year deal for Rooney that would see him earn around £650,000-a-week after tax. \nThey are also prepared to pay the first six months of his salary up front, along with a signing- on fee — meaning he would immediately bank £25m. \nA source told The Sun: “Wayne has generally been very happy at United for the past 13 years and was delighted to become the club’s record goalscorer. \n“But he has dropped down the pecking order and there comes a time in everyone’s career when you have to consider whether it might be sensible to move. He’s not agitating for a move but, if the right offer comes in, something is likely to happen.
