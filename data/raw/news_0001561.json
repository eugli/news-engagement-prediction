Those results are expected on Friday. \nREAD MORE: * Spike of E.coli levels at Waitara beach \nA positive E.coli test in a water supply can indicate the presence or for other pathogens, including Campylobacteriosis, Cryptosporidiosis and Giardiasis. \nThe council said under national water standards, where a positive reading is returned, water is re-tested within 24 hours to check for a second positive before acting. \nBut it said it had \"acted conservatively, and immediately\" by chlorinating immediately. \nNapier Mayor Bill Dalton said residents did no need to boil water because the chlorine would neutralise any contamination in the supply. \n“We are taking the precaution of chlorinating ahead of the second test results being available to us, just to be on the safe side. We are advising residents not to panic – and that we will be in touch again as soon as we possibly can.” Ad Feedback \nSome Napier residents reacted with alarm to the news on Facebook, but the council's manager asset strategy, Chris Dolley, said there was no evidence to suggest the water was not fit for drinking. \nThe E.coli scare in Napier has hit as a government inquiry sits 20km away in Hastings to determine the cause of a water supply Campylobacter outbreak that left more than 5000 residents sick in Havelock North in August last year. \n\"There is no reason to believe we are going down that road,\" Dolley said. \n\"We had a number of tests down at other reservoirs and all of those tests came back negative. Our test is isolated with one particular location.\" \nThe Hawke's Bay District Health Board said it and the council had agreed chlorination of the reservoir was necessary, as a precautionary measure. \nMedical officer of health Nick Jones said if the water was contaminated authorities didn't want to lose a day waiting for further testing to come back. \n\"This [first] test does not give us a clear idea of whether it is a health concern at this stage, however, chlorinating the water was the only way to prevent potentially contaminated water from being distributed throughout the reservoir's zone.\" \nJones said there have been no increased reports of sickness in the Napier area, however if anyone was feeling sick with diarrhoea and/or vomiting that lives in this area they should see or call their health professional or call Healthline 0800 611 116. \nThe district health board said it had alerted the Ministry of Health and general practice in the Napier area. Napier schools have also been asked to report any increase in sickness to the Ministry of Education. Jones said the risk of contamination in the reticulated water system was low as tests from the water in the system outside of the reservoir were negative. \nThe Enfield Rd reservoir, on Napier Hill, is currently servicing much of Napier including Taradale and Bay View. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:24:53.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
