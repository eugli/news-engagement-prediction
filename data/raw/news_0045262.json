Like, to a T. There are no alterations that need to be done. Even the height is perfect with the heels, and then the fit, the cut, the sleeves, everything — just right.” \nThe bridal assistant then brings out a sparkly veil with scalloped details to match the edges on her dress, and Jinger can hardly take her eyes off the mirror. \n“I just can’t believe this, guys! I’m blown away,” she says. “I just love this one. This is the veil! This is it.” \nAnd with everything all set to go just days before the wedding, Jinger jokes that she half-expected Vuolo to show up and marry her right then and there. \n“I’m waiting for him to surprise me. He always surprises me,” she says. “Is it a surprise wedding today? Everybody’s already in town!” \nBut all jokes aside, the TLC star admits that seeing herself in her wedding dress for the last time before the big day was an emotional experience. \n“Once I was finally in my dress and had the veil on, just looking in the mirror, it seemed so surreal,” she says. “Because you wait for that so long, that when the moment is there, it’s hard to believe that it’s finally me who’s getting married.” \nCounting On features Jinger and Jeremy’s two-hour wedding event Monday at 9 p.m. ET on TLC.
