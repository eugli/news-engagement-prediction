He doesn’t want the Balkanisation of the UK. \nHe added: “What she is saying is tosh, she’s misleading the Scottish people. It’s just not possible.” GETTY The ex-Brussels bigwig allegedly said Sturgeon had not agreed any single market access I had a meeting with President Schulz and he said quite clearly, and he’d just had a meeting with her, and he did not agree to anything David Coburn \nThe 58-year-old claimed Sturgeon’s chances of Scottish independence would be dashed once Britain leaves the clutches of the bureaucratic Brussels bloc which is why she is so determined to muddy the waters surrounding Brexit. \nHe added: “We do four times as much business with the rest of the UK than with the EU. Scottish people are starting to tweak.” \nMr Coburn also urged Theresa May to reject any calls from Sturgeon to hold another Scottish independence referendum. PA David Coburn told the Express.co.uk Sturgeon's plans are tosh \n“Scotland will lose a lot of jobs due to unease. What’s going to happen in the future. What’s the currency going to be? It’s nonsense. \n“If Scotland did reapply for EU membership, it would have to adopt the euro, which brings a whole bucket of problems. \n“We’d have to create a central bank and square a £15billion budget deficit. Look what they did to Greece. They crushed Greece and hit them with austerity. Scotland would be hit with even bigger austerity. They are lost and desperately trying to change the situation.” UKIP MEP Paul Nuttall visits the Roma ghetto in Sofia Wed, February 1, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:13:54.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
