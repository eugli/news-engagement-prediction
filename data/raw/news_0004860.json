The mural at Tottenham Court Road (Thierry Bal) \nA section which was removed from the wall at the old Oxford Street entrance has been lowered down a lift shaft to a new site at platform level. \nThe sections that could not be relocated have been given to Edinburgh College of Art, where the pop artist was a professor, and are used to teach students. \nPaolozzi’s design, which covers 950 square metres, was completed in 1986 and is one of the Tube’s most famous examples of public art seen by many of the 150,000 people who use the station every day. \nEleanor Pinfield, Head of Art on the Underground, said: “The restoration process has been a painstaking one, but today we can see the expansive beauty of the work once again. \n“The rotunda has been enhanced with new lighting, and throughout the station the repair and cleaning of the mosaics allows the full breadth, scale and ambition of the work to be enjoyed by a new generation of Underground customers. \n“The former Oxford Street panel is a key part of Paolozzi’s vision for the station, drawing together many of the themes seen in the wider station artwork, and I am delighted to see it back on public view.” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T14:06:46.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
