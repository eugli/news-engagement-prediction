The Broncos have two young quarterbacks — Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch — and the team has stated that they will compete for the starting job in 2017. \nHowever, the options on the free-agent market will always be looked over with a fine-tooth comb by John Elway. For a look at all of the quarterbacks who will be free agents this offseason, click here . \nThe first name that jumps off the page is that of Kirk Cousins, who has spent the first four years of his career with the Washington Redskins. The Redskins aren’t likely to let Cousins get away and even if they did, the Broncos aren’t going to pay the kind of money he will be looking for. \nIf the Buffalo Bills do not pick up his option , Tyrod Taylor will be another name to consider. He may not be a realistic option for the Broncos, who would seemingly be giving up on Siemian and Lynch by signing Taylor. For what it's worth — Denver tried to sign Tyrod Taylor in 2015. The Broncos OC at the time? New Bills OC Rick Dennison. \n— Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) January 19, 2017 \nRealistically, the Broncos could add a third quarterback just to be ready to serve in an emergency situation, similar to what they did with Austin Davis this past season. \nBrian Hoyer or Shaun Hill could be considered for that role. Dan Orlovsky or Kellen Clemens — career backups — would be even cheaper options. \nWhat might make even more sense would be for the Broncos to draft another young quarterback to serve as its third-string option for next season and beyond. Elway may decide he doesn’t want to spend precious cap space on a quarterback who likely won’t see the field. \nThough Davis was on the team for most of the year last season, he never took a snap. \nThe Broncos seem focused on developing either Lynch or Siemian into the every-day starter and letting the other serve as his backup. It’s hard to argue with that formula. With Siemian being a seventh-round draft pick, there isn’t a lot of money tied up in the position. That’s one of the main reasons Mark Sanchez was cut last year during the preseason. \nIn the end, I don’t expect the Broncos to make a play for any of the quarterbacks on the free-agent market this offseason. Instead, look for them to draft a guy in the later rounds of April’s NFL draft.
