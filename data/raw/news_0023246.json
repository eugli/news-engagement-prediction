Under the current laws, the Romanian could be fined up to £2,500 and three points for using his mobile while driving. But as a result of the campaign, drivers caught using their phones from March will then receive a tougher six penalty points. The campaign was launched after Tomasz Kroker killed a mother and three children after his lorry smashed into the back of them on the A34 in Berkshire due to the Polish lorry driver being distracted by his mobile phone. The pair are understood to have set off from Greenford, West London at 5am on January 25 and travelled along the A127 on their way to Essex. This terrifying display of ignorance of road safety was captured by the driver’s apprentice who was set next to him in the passenger seat while he was meant to be being shown how to carry out the job in the correct manner ‘We’re given five shifts with experienced drivers so they show us how things are done,’ the trainee said. ‘But almost as soon as we left, his mobile phone’s out, texting, making calls. I asked him to stop twice, but he looked at me and shrugged as although I’d heard him using relatively good English earlier. ‘It was overcast and drizzling and the road conditions weren’t particularly brilliant. I was frightened. I was nervous to the point of being a hair’s breadth away from getting out and walking away. ‘He was driving an 18-ton truck loaded with pub supplies — machinery, food, drinks — and they don’t stop on a sixpence.’ After they returned to the depot at around 2pm the apprentice said he reported the driver to his supervisor and completed a statement - as well as supplying them with copies of the evidence. He added: ‘I was later told that the driver was suspended, but I went to the depot on Friday and saw him signing on for a shift.’ Chireata was unavailable for comment when contacted by the newspaper, with friends claiming he was on holiday, but his wife said: ‘He has been a driver in Europe for five years and never had an accident.’ Kuehne & Nagel were unavailable for comment when contacted last night.
