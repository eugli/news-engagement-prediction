BGB director general, however, called upon the BSF to ensure zero killing on the border and raise awareness among Indian citizens over the matter.\nThe two forces agreed to lead joint patrols in areas prone to cattle and drug smuggling and aware mass people about international border law. \nThey also agreed to visit and inspect the crime scenes together. \nHowever, on a note of investigation, BGB head Abul Hossain said: \"Neither BGB nor BSF can investigate a murder. That is the job of the police forces of the respective countries.\" \nTo fight environment pollution, an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) will be set up at India's Agartala border while a box culvert drainage will be constructed at Bangladesh's Akhaura border. \nThe two heads have agreed to raise border huts and pursue respective ministries to upgrade border tourism. \nThey have also reached consensus to launch joint training, drills, rafting, rowing, mountain climbing, etc. \nKK Sharma led 19 BSF members while Abul Hossain represented a 26-member BGB team at the conference. \nThe next border conference is scheduled for the first week of October this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:49:31.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
