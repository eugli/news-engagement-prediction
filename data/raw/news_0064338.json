For a console that lacks defining first-party games beyond the Halo, Gears of War, and Forza franchises, the Insomniac Games title seemed like a natural candidate to receive a sequel. But more than two years removed from its launch, the franchise is still dormant. \nWe asked Insomniac president Ted Price why there has been no movement on a sequel, and he replied, \"You'd have to ask Microsoft.\" But with or without Microsoft's participation, Sunset Overdrive may grind again.\n\"We are passionate about that franchise, and we own it, so you may see more Sunset in the future from us,\" Price said. \"No promises, and no timeline to speak of, but it is something that represents our willingness to create unexpected experiences.\"\n\nRight now, Insomniac is currently working on the PS4-exclusive Spider-Man and its VR title The Unspoken, which has a full season of content planned. The studio just came off its busiest year to date, shipping Ratchet & Clank, Song of the Deep, Edge of Nowhere, Feral Rites, and The Unspoken all in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:30:08.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
