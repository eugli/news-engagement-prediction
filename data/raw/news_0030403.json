Everyone should take the pledge with me.\" \nA little later, Sasikala said, \"Everyone should take the pledge at former CM J Jayalalithaa's memorial on Marina Beach and then capture the secretariat.\" \n\"Amma has left behind the party as our wealth. We will take it,\" she added. \nIn her speech, the AIADMK general secretary also talked about the education of AIADMK legislators. \n\"You are not highly educated, but Amma was. Despite that, she trained you so that you could dream of one day becoming an MLA. Don't forget what she did. How she raised you up from your humble origins,\" she said. \nSasikala also tried to win the support of her MLAs saying, \"With your support I will face anything. I have the courage. I will not step back from any decisions taken. I will take the right decisions at the right time. I will not back off.\" \nShe blamed the opposition for fomenting trouble in the ruling party and scuttling her chances to become the chief minister as she was a woman . \n\"They say, she is a woman we can threaten her. That didn't work with Amma. It won't work with me. There are so many people in our party that - only I can capture the secretariat. We will not - cow down. We will stand united,\" she added. \nWatch: VK Sasikala breaks down while addressing AIADMK MLAs at Golden Bay resort in Kuvathur, Tamil Nadu. #WATCH : #VKSasikala breaks down while addressing AIADMK MLAs at Golden Bay resort in Kuvathur #TamilNadu pic.twitter.com/t5BYySbqwQ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:50:44.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
