BRYONY HARRIS 7 Heavy D and Bryony Harris had matching watermelon-inspired outfits made for their engagement party \nColin – who first found fame competing on the UK version of Storage Hunters – was pictured getting very handy one of the dancers from new reality show Pole Life in Epsom on Saturday night. \nThe garish outfit had been especially commissioned for the couple’s watermelon and crazy golf-themed engagement party, with die-hard Arsenal fan Colin shelling out over £1000 for his suit and a further £300 for a matching skirt for Bryony. \nSpeaking exclusively to The Sun online, the fed-up YouTuber said: “After we broke up I had a phone call to say that his suit and my skirt were ready for collection. \n“He told me he would collect them and post my skirt to me as a final goodbye present – but it never came. \n“When I saw him wearing it and pawing at those women it made me sick.” Fame Flynet 7 Heavy D took a particular shine to one busty blonde as he partied the night away – wearing the £1000 ‘engagement suit’ \nBryony reveals that Colin’s generous gift was meant to signal the start of their future lives together – with Bryony loving him so much that she would even put up with his irritating “BOOM!” catchphrase. \n“I’ll never forget how excited I was when we went in and ordered them, it seemed like we had our whole lives together. \n“When we went back to Gresham and Blake at the fitting had me imagining our engagement party and our future together. \n“Now looking at makes me feel angry, disgusted and used.” Fame Flynet Heavy couldn’t believe his luck as one woman started grinding on him Fame Flynet Randy Heavy D couldn’t keep his hands off one particular babe – much to Bryony’s horror \nLast night Heavy D sensationally defended wearing the custom made outfit. \nSpeaking exclusively to The Sun online, he said: “It seemed a shame to waste a great suit.” \nBryony and Colin – who competed on the summer series of CBB – had their first date in late July, after meeting on Twitter shortly before he entered the house. \nTheir engagement came a month later, with Heavy D popping the question live on Lizzie Cundy’s FuBar Radio show . \nBut while it might have seemed spontaneous, Bryony claims her fame-hungry ex told her that he was doing it to help keep himself in the public eye. \nShe recalled: “I went to Tesco for him as he couldn’t be bothered, and when I got home he told me he wanted us to get engaged. \n“It was just so he could get press – and before I knew it we were rushing around trying to find a ring. CBB: Heavy D jumps in the hot tub and teases Sam Fox \n\"I did it as I knew it would make him happy, and he told me that he did want to marry me, as well as using it to boost his profile. \n\"After he proposed so publicly I always hoped that he would ask me again in private and make it more special - but he never bothered.\" \nBut while the couple seemed to have different ideas about matrimony and happy ever afters, they did at least agree on the type of wedding they wanted. \nBryony explains: \"I wanted a real hippy wedding with haybales and tents and a performance by Jedward.\" Fame Flynet 7 Bryony and Heavy D were set to get married - despite their 22 year age difference \nSadly there was never a chance for Jedward to make their super-fan's dream come true as the couple split before even drafting up a guest list. \nTheir relationship imploded on Christmas Day shortly after the couple exchanged thoughtful gifts . \nHe bought her perfume and a camera to help her build her YouTube career, she gave him framed photographs of the loved-up pair and bought him a vintage holdall \"as he usually carried all his stuff in a disgusting carrier bag.\" \nHowever, a blazing row about one of Colin's female friends saw him storm out of her Brighton home and return to London, their relationship in tatters. Fame Flynet The couple even got matching tattoos \nBryony adds: \"My grandma, dad and sister were all there and they even got him presents, too. \n\"I think Colin was mentally abusive to me - he would constantly try and wind me up, and he knows I've got mental health issues and struggle with anger.\" Heavy D's fiance Bryony Harris pleads with Honey G to collab with CBB \nAfter going their separate ways - which Bryony claims was a frequent occurrence during their passionate five month relationship - she claims Colin was \"grieving for their relationship\". \nShe says: \"We spoke on the phone on New Year's Day and he was telling me he missed me, he loved me and wanted me back. \n\"I told him, 'Pull yourself together. You've got panto in a couple of hours'. \n\"But I missed him, and I did go and see him in early January, but I was horrified by what I found. \n\"He was in a terrible state after a string of big nights and hadn't showered for days. \n\"His flat was an absolute bombsite, he hadn't changed the sheets for weeks, and the toilet was absolutely filthy.\" Latest in TV and Showbiz 'JORDAN IS RIGHT UP HIS STREET!'

BRYONY HARRIS 7 Bryony received these flowers just last week - days later Colin was pawing a stripper in Epsom \nWhile the gesture could have gone some way to thaw Bryony's heart , Heavy D's shenanigans over the weekend have killed whatever feelings she might have still harboured for him. \nAfter seeing her former fiancé bending over a pole dancer and simulating having sex with her, she's adamant that their relationship is over - for GOOD.
