They were still gunned down.\" \nAmnesty also said officers planted evidence and falsified reports to \"cover their tracks\". \nThe rights group said there appeared to be financial incentives for the killings, with one officer claiming they were given an \"under the table\" payment for each death, as well as payments from some funeral homes. Media caption Raffy Lerma is a photo-journalist documenting the nightly killings \nThe rights group said the vast majority of those killed were poor and on \"drug watch lists\" prepared by government officials and shared with police. \nIt said the lists were \"deeply problematic\" and that names could be put on it \"based on hearsay and community rumour or rivalry, with little to no verification\". \nThe group spoke to 110 people for the report including witnesses of killings, victims' relatives, drug users, police officers, and members of government, civil society and religious groups.
