'I've realised that to stay consistent and motivated you need to really care about everything on the inside: your bones, organs and muscles. 'That way what you eat and how you exercise has a lot more meaning and purpose.' As well as dropping the dress sizes, she has lost 4 inches from her waist and can comfortably shop in Zara and Topshop and no longer 'reach for oversized T shirts and leggings' (left: after, right: before) Speaking to FEMAIL about her decision to shift the pounds, Connie said: 'Enough was enough; I realised I was 24 years old and never once liked or enjoyed my body' Bradley, who has hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers thanks to his no-nosense fitness plan, gave his sister a workout and healthy eating plan. 'I used to scream and shout for my family to leave me alone and would think of every excuse under the sun,' she said. 'But my brother has inspired me to become more active in order to become more confident. He's shown me how important it is to love yourself.'

Whilst the sweet potato is cooking, chop all the ingredients (except soured cream obviously) into small chunks and gently fry in some coconut oil. 3. Cut the sweet potato in half long ways and scoop the centre of the potato out leaving about 3cm radius left to enjoy (use left over sweet potato for mash in another dish). 4. Load it with your filling and top with a dollop of soured cream. Load the potato with whatever vegetables and lean protein you enjoy- it doesn't have to be meat! DINNER: The Sexiest Salmon Ingredients: 1 x large salmon fillet, 60g wholegrain rice, 2 pak choi bulbs, 1 x garlic clove, 1/2 inch of ginger, big pinch of chilli flakes, tbsp of honey and 3 tbsp, soy sauce/Tamari. 1.

Connie says she loves that never feels hungry and still gets to enjoy meals such as loaded potato skins, chilli con carne, roast dinner and even red velvet brownies. 'I've tried all the slimming clubs and they never worked for me because snacks are full of sugar and low in fat. This guide focuses on high protein and high fat diet with lots of vegetables and small amounts of carbs,' she explained. Connie works out around four times a week but says some of these sessions are just 'quick 20 minute' interval sprinting exercises. 'I literally give 110 per cent on the treadmill in a short space of time and it fits so well into my busy schedule,' she said. Connie concluded: 'I can't believe I'm wearing size 12 clothes again, it's been six years! 'My aim is to get to a healthy size 10-12 as that suits my body shape and I want to continue to inspire women to look and feel beautiful from the inside out.'
