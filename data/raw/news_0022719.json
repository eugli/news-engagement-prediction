This pledge also comes with an official naming certificate, which you can frame, burn or casually post on your ex’s Facebook wall for all to see.\n If you’re feeling spendy, throw in $35 to get a plush cockroach included in the package. To treat yourself even more, $50 will get you all of that and a box of chocolates. Revenge really is sweet.\nYou don’t have to live in NYC to enact your vindictive plot— The Bronx Zoo provides digital certificates through an online portal that automatically notifies your “Valentine” of their new insect namesake.\nEach and every cockroach donation goes towards the health and upkeep of the zoo’s animals. It’s also incredibly therapeutic, because nothing says closure like roaching your ex.\nFollow Sam on Instagram and Twitter .\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/swan_sam", "https://www.facebook.com/Cosmopolitan/videos/10155036150722708/", "http://bronxzoo.com/roach", "https://www.instagram.com/samswan/"], "published": "2017-02-07T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:06:35.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
