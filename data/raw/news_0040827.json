Well, maybe, but try telling that to Lincoln City. The Imps have made it past Guiseley, Altrincham, three-time semi-finalists Oldham Athletic, 1983 finalists Brighton and Hove Albion and 1978 winners Ipswich Town to make it to the last 16 for the first time in 130 years. (They lost 3-0 in Glasgow against Rangers in 1887, for the record. Different times all right.) If they beat Burnley this lunchtime, they’ll become the first non-league side to reach the quarter-finals since Queens Park Rangers in 1914. The magic of the cup gone? Right you are. \nBeating Burnley this lunchtime is a hell of an ask, mind. Sean Dyche might be tempted into making a couple of changes, but his comfortable Premier League team have lost just three of their last 29 matches at Turf Moor. Liverpool, Everton and reigning champions Leicester City have been seen off this season; champions-elect Chelsea were contained just the other week. And Burnley fancy recreating events of 1914 themselves; it was the year they won their only FA Cup. The magic of the old pot gone? Oh I don’t think so. \nKick off: 12.30pm.
