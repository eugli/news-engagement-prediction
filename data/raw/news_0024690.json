A + A - Cheteshwar Pujara (BCCI Photo) \nHyderabad has seen some elegant cricketers come out of its narrow lanes in the past. There was Gundappa Vishwanath, Mohammad Azharuddin and VVS Laxman, who carried on the city's Nawabi heritage, with their elegant and wristy style of play. \nHowever, there's one player who may not have a birth-relation with Hyderabad but has made the city his own. \nCheteshwar Pujara's love affair with runs and Hyderabad is like a stream which runs deep. The 29-year-old's love affair with the ground continued as he broke a half-century-old record on Thursday on day one of the one-off Test against Bangladesh. \nOn 23 Aug 2012, Pujara hit his first Test hundred in Hyderabad when he slammed a majestic 159 against New Zealand. A little over six months later, the Rajkot-born player, who has a penchant of scoring big hundreds, came up with his second Test double century at the same venue against Australia on March 2, 2013. \nBoth these innings established Pujara's special relationship with the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium at Uppal. \nAnd today, the relationship just grew a bit stronger. \nPujara, who came to bat when India were in trouble at 2/1 in the first over, overcame occasional discomforts to set the foundation for another special knock at his favourite venue. \nPujara, along with Murali Vijay, steered India out of the rough waters with a 178-run stand for the second wicket, becoming the second-best Indian pair in terms of runs scored in a season. \nIt was a perfect fixture for Pujara. The ground was his den, and with favourite batting partner at the other end, Pujara looked destined for his 11th hundred. \nHowever, sometimes even destiny can take a wrong turn. Trying to defend one against young Bangladesh off-spinner Mehedi Hasan Miraz, Pujara got a thick outside edge which was well collected by the visiting captain Mushfiqur Rahim. \nIt brought an end to Pujara's fluent innings of 83. \nAlthough Pujara fell short of a hundred, he did manage to break a 52-year-old record set by another Indian giant Chandu Borde. \nWith 1605 runs, Pujara surpassed Borde's (1604) record of the most runs by any player in Indian first-class season set way back in 1964-65 and carried his legacy forward at the venue.
