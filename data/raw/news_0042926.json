The bodies will be handed over to the political administration of the agency. \nThe development came just two days after security forces launched a nationwide crackdown on after a bomb ripped through Lal Shahbaz Qalandar’s shrine in Sehwan, Sindh, killing over 100 militants across the country. Pakistan has seen a dramatic improvement in security in the past two years, but there have been multiple attacks this week. The assaults underscore Pakistan’s struggle to stamp out extremism, which was stepped up after the country’s deadliest ever attack, a TTP assault on Army Public School in Peshawar in 2014 which left more than 150 people dead – mostly children.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T14:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T09:46:56.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
