George Ford had been linked with Sale Sharks Credit: REX FEATURES \nI t is believed that is far less than what he was offered by Sale, but the lure of Welford Road, where he left to join Bath in 2013, and the prospect of playing alongside England team-mate Ben Youngs at half-back, swung it in Leicester's favour. \nIn a further twist, Freddie Burns could be heading in the opposite direction. Burns, it appears, is unwilling to play second fiddle to the England No 10, and is happy to move to Bath where his family is based. Freddie Burns could be moving to Bath Credit: REX FEATURES \nB ath's willingness to allow Ford to join Premiership rivals Leicester is a major turn-around.
