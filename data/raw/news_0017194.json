If there’s a terrorist attack on America, the “so-called” judge who blocked Donald Trump’s travel ban will be to blame , along with the entire US “court system”. \nIt won’t be because demoralised security agencies struggling to adapt to unqualified new managers fail to produce accurate intelligence in exceptionally stressful circumstances. \nNor will it be down to the baseline threat level rising as a result of heightened antagonism between the new administration and the global Muslim community. \nNo, from this moment onwards any terrorist attack, regardless of the origin of the perpetrators, can be blamed on the justice system for failing to uphold the president’s executive order. \nHow convenient. What a wonderful excuse, neatly circumventing America’s division of powers, centuries of legal precedent, and the constitution itself. \nBy upping his criticism of Judge Robart, who suspended the travel ban, and the federal appeals court which rejected the administration’s bid to reinstate it, Donald Trump is doing far more than blowing off steam on Twitter. He’s identifying and zeroing in on yet another enemy: the judiciary. Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 \nT hat’s a neat trick, given that the justice system is one of the few official levers of power left to hold an unruly administration in check. \nTrump has already got to work decimating the unofficial ones. The media, whose job in any democracy is to hold the government to account and report the truth, has been rebranded as “the opposition party” , paving the way for the administration to dismiss any critical coverage. \nTrump’s team have been skirting round the inconvenience of journalists’ questions by just refusing to take any , and by flat-out lying when they do. If you thought press secretary Sean Spicer’s “alternative facts” about the size of the inauguration crowd were worrying, watch Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway justify an executive order by citing a massacre that never happened.

What happens when the media starts uncovering the gritty details of the business conflicts Trump is still ensnared in , reporting dodgy deals in foreign countries that line the pockets of his associates to the detriment of US taxpayers? \nThe American electorate is already primed for two sets of “facts” punctuated by accusations of “fake news”, as Trump’s bombardment of lies and insults desensitises them to the truth. \nThink that’s hyperbolic? Look at Trump’s early morning tweets on Monday, declaring “any negative polls are fake news”. Like his attack on Judge Robart, his response to any resistance is flat-out rejection. Polls don’t matter, facts don’t matter, the law doesn’t matter.. Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017 I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017 \nA nd the American people themselves, those 319 million individuals who Trump is supposed to be representing and serving? They don’t matter either, except the 63 million who voted for him. The rest are either illegal voters, or don’t exist. Far from making any effort to be a president for all after his election, Trump is relishing the controversy and discord his win still evokes. \nAt every available opportunity he makes a point of highlighting whether or not a person supported him – from the CIA employees forced to endure his self-aggrandisement at the Memorial Wall to the the chaplain of the US Senate at the at National Prayer Breakfast, at which Trump “prayed” for the TV ratings of Arnold Schwarzenegger . \nWhen half a million protestors marched in Washington DC alone on the day after Trump’s inauguration, the president’s response was “Why didn’t these people vote?”, as though the 66 million people who voted for Hillary Clinton simply evaporated after election day. Trump has also branded all demonstrators as “professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters”, smoothly delegitimising anyone using their First Amendment rights to oppose his administration. Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017 \nT his week’s victim is the judiciary, but it’s not a new strategy –cast your mind back to Trump’s assault on Judge Curiel in June, whom he claimed was biased because of his “Mexican heritage” and therefore unqualified to rule on the Trump University lawsuit. \nNor is it a tactic specific to the US; even here, the High Court judges who initially ruled against the government in the case of Article 50 were portrayed by some as the per personification of elitism, standing in the way of the will of the electorate. \nOf course judges, with their extensive academic education and decades of law experience, tend to be “elite” in the true sense of the word; what better target for a populist president looking to cement an “us v. them” mentality among his supporters? \nIt’s not hard to predict who will be next: the governors, mayors and state attorneys who are already getting ready to challenge Trump’s sweeping executive orders. Trump has been so successful building up the fantasy of his spectacular victory (facts and alternative facts be damned) that he can vocally discount any pushback as “undemocratic”. Get ready for tweets attacking “so-called governors”, “so-called states' rights”, and eventually the “so-called constitution”. \nEven Congress isn’t immune. Trump is already dismissing any objection from the Democrats as the work of “Fake Tears Chuck Schumer” (the Democratic Senate minority leader). Republican Congressmen who dare to oppose him will get the same treatment. In Trump’s world, democracy is a one-way street. \nSo don’t be shocked by Trump’s assault on the judiciary. Be aware. Be vigilant. And be prepared to fight back.
