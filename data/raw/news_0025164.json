Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA heartbroken bride has launched a desperate appeal to find her antique wedding dress - after it was allegedly lost by a dry cleaner. \nTess Newall, 29, proudly walked down the aisle in June last year wearing her great-great-grandmother's lace gown which dates back to 1870. \nBut the newlywed was devastated to discover that the priceless family heirloom had been lost after the dry cleaner she trusted went into administration. \nTess, from Haddington, East Lothian, launched a Facebook appeal to track down the dress, which is feared to have been sold by Kleen Cleaners in Edinburgh. (Photo: Facebook) \nPosting on the social media site, she wrote: \"PLEASE HELP FIND THIS DRESS! \n\"I have just found out that the dry cleaners have lost my much loved wedding dress. It was made by my Great Great Granny in 1870 (I altered the top) and I wore it in June 2016. \n\"Kleen Cleaners in Edinburgh used to be the best but recently fell into crooked hands and have gone into liquidation. \n\"It seems that the dress was taken to be sold so it could be winging its way anywhere. Please share this far and wide in case anyone stumbles across it! \n\"I realise there are far greater issues in the world but it means the world to us. More family memories need to be woven into its threads. \n\"Thank you so so much.\" Read More Four couples in five forced to choose between a home or a wedding - The 6 government schemes to help you buy faster (Photo: Facebook) \nThe appeal went viral shortly after it was posted on Friday with more than 156,000 shares on Facebook. \nSet designer Tess told MailOnline that the dress was made and first worn by her great-great-grandmother, Dora Torin, who married hat-maker Ernest. \nTess stumbled upon the gown in pristine condition in her 88-year-old grandmother Joanna Torin's attic after she got engaged in August 2015. \nShe wore the beautiful lace dress at her at her wedding to Alfred Newall in a church in Morham, East Lothian, in June 2016. \nBut when her father, Vice Lord-Lieutenant of East Lothian Patrick Gammell, went to collect the dress, he was horrified to find Kleen Cleaners had gone into administration and the gown was gone. \nShe told MailOnline: \"The dress was one of the most special things about the day, it made it complete and I was overjoyed to have been able to wear such a beautiful family heirloom. \n\"I don't want any kind of witch hunt against the company, the only thing that matters to me is getting my dress back. \n\"I hate the thought that something which has spent so many generations in my family has gone missing after I wore it, it's been awful and very distressing.\" Can you help find Tess's dress?
