Picture: Mark Scott.\nThis followed research that found shoppers were more likely to steal at a self-serve machine, partly because customers were distanced from the human face of the business.\nSupermarket theft is compounded by the ease with which self-serve machines allow shoppers to pass off more expensive fruit, vegetables and bakery products as cheaper products.\nThe “swipe everything as carrots” mentality was prevalent among young customers, who confessed to supermarket research body Canstar Blue that they had ripped off supermarkets at the self-serve.\nCanstar Blue told news.com.au that while younger customers had embraced self-serve because they actively tried to avoid interaction with others while shopping, they also practised the “five-finger discount”.\nmedia_camera Customers using the self-serve checkout at Coles will have to restrict their purchases to just 12 items.

Picture: News Corp.\nIn early October, Coles called on NSW police to help them target self-serve checkout theft, and reduce its annual overall theft debt of $1.1 billion.\nColes says it was tired of shoppers who either didn’t scan products to avoid paying, or scanned cheaper items to get a discount on more expensive products.\nSupermarket theft is compounded by the ease at which self-serve machines allowed shoppers to pass off more costly fruit, vegetables and bakery products as cheaper items.\n“We have had a lot of interest in self-serve check-outs and what is being done to reduce theft,” Coles spokeswoman Martine Alpins said.\nShe admitted there had been “a normalisation of theft at self-service check-outs”.\nSuperintendent Murray Chapman said police would get serious about targeting thieves.\nCanstar Blue found that one in six customers aged in their 30s said they had deliberately not paid for an item at a self-service checkout.\nAlmost one in 10 shoppers of all ages admitted they had cheated supermarkets in the self-serve section, Canstar Blue found in its survey. Men were more likely to steal than women.\nColes has already used technology to recalibrate machines in its Victorian stores to speed up self-service shopping.\nmedia_camera Twelve items or less can still be checked out in the self-serve lanes at Coles supermarkets.
