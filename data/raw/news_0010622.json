But a state security spokesman said the government has not been able to make an official tally.\nSchools in the area closed, as did public health clinics and other local offices. State officials, who argue they have no resources to raise wages, have already replaced the police commander and say they will not renew negotiations with officers until they return to work.\n“There is no way we can accept this attitude, leaving the population deprived of an essential service like public security,” Cesar Colnago, the state’s governor, told reporters after announcing the federal aid.\nPresident Michel Temer, who also authorized the use of federal troops to quell uprisings in prisons last month that led to around 140 deaths in various states , dispatched the country’s defense minister to Espirito Santo on Monday.\nThe state security spokesman said federal troops were expected to arrive by Tuesday.\nSeveral other Brazilian states are grappling with a financial crisis. In Rio de Janeiro, the state government has been struggling to pay expenses including salaries of police, teachers and doctors and basic supplies for schools and hospitals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:26:25.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
