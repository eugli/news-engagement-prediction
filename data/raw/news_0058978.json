(Supplied) Strong winds blamed for North West hot air balloon crash landing \nThe Hague - A passenger plane skidded along a runway at Amsterdam's busy airport on Thursday as its landing gear collapsed on hitting the ground during heavy winds, but no passengers were injured, officials told AFP. \nVideo images of the Flybe plane carrying 59 passengers and crew from Edinburgh showed the plane struggling to stay on course as it came in to land at Schiphol airport, with The Netherlands buffeted by a strong winter storm. \nThe plane came to rest on the runway, but with its right wing tipped over to the side close to the grass. Airport officials said they were still investigating the cause of the incident. \n\"The plane's landing gear collapsed as it came in to land,\" Schiphol spokesperson Jacco Bartelds told AFP. \n\"Nobody was injured. They are evacuating passengers now and taking them to the airport building by bus,\" he added. \nThe Netherlands took the brunt of gale-force winds on Thursday afternoon as the storm - which killed one woman in Britain - caused flight delays and cancellations at Schiphol, one of Europe's largest hubs. \nThe Dutch weather service said winds at times were gusting up between 100-120km/h. \nAround 100 flights were cancelled at the airport and 60 percent of all flights have been delayed by the bad weather, another Schiphol spokesperson Willemeike Koster said. \nElsewhere, the wind blew over trucks and trailers on the highways, and littered roadways with fallen branches. \nDutch meteorologists have sent out a \"code orange\" alert for most of the western part of The Netherlands until early Friday.
