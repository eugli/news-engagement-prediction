But Jolly LLB 2 has been in the eye of storm for quite sometime now. First the mention of a shoe brand allegedly shown in poor light, left the film in a legal soup and now the way the Indian judiciary in the film has been depicted seems to have become a major issue. Latest report suggests that the Bombay High Court ordered deletion of four scenes and modification of dialogues in the Akshay Kumar film. This definitely didn’t go down well with makers of the film who have now moved to supreme court. \nLet us tell you hear that the film has already been certified by the CBFC who passed it with an U/A and no cuts. In fact, reports suggest that the alleged scene where the shoe brand was mocked for their apparently cheap products has, been deleted too. But now they will have to reissue the certificate after the Bombay HC’s decision. Indian Today informs, “The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court has ordered the deletion of four scenes in Akshay Kumar and Huma Qureshi’s upcoming film Jolly LLB 2 – a scene where a scared judge is hiding behind the chair, another where a shoe is hurled, a scene with objectionable signalling and dialogues in an argument scene have to be modified.” Nanded-based lawyer Ajaykumar Waghmare had filed a petition, saying that the film is “nothing but an attempt to portray the Indian Legal Profession and Judicial System as a laughing stock to the society at large.” (Also read: Akshay Kumar is on a roll, says Hrithik Roshan after watching Jolly LLB 2 ) \nThe court had constituted a three member bench to watch the film and it seems they have found many anomalies in it, in regards to the way Indian Judicial system and the fraternity as a whole have been portrayed. The producers are thus moving to Supreme Court today or tomorrow as the film releases this week and such a controversy can hamper that.
