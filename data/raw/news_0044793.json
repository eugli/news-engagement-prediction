It’s not even mature.\nBut it appears to be a tactic to prevent his countrymen from criticizing him.\nIn that context, Trump’s characterization of the free press as the enemy of the American people is just another eye-roller.\nBut a long list of dictators would not roll their eyes. They would nod vigorously in agreement.\nWhen the president of the United States joins the ranks of new-speak thugs who equate free speech with treason, it’s time for a refresher course in the Bill of Rights.\nMedia's role in a democracy The First Amendment’s protections of a free press and free speech were a direct result of a deep suspicion of government by our Founders.\nThat suspicion of central control remains particularly deep in conservatives, which makes their docile acceptance of Trump’s anti-speech blather very odd.\nThis isn’t really about the press.\nIt’s about the public, which learns what government is doing because of the prying of reporters.\nThe 18th-century American patriots who set up a system of checks and balances within government also provided for an outside check on the natural fondness of politicians to amass personal power and do things in the dark. That check is the news media.\nReporters aren’t supposed to be friendly with politicians.\n'How dictators get started' As Arizona’s Republican Sen. John McCain told “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd:\n“I hate the press. I hate you, especially.” (Todd laughed) “But the fact is, we need you. . . . If you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and, many times, adversarial press . . . without it, I am afraid that we would lose so much of our individual liberties over time. That's how dictators get started.”\nThat’s how dictators get started.\nOne proven way to control people is by silencing or discrediting legitimate news outlets – which, in this country, adhere to standards of ethics as a result of libel laws and years of tradition.\nTrump’s fondness for dismissing mainstream media as “fake news” in response to news he doesn’t like is an attempt to discredit the media – and control information. That is step one to controlling the people.\nIn this country, the people are supposed to be in charge. They are free to interpret facts any way they like, but it all starts with facts.\nNot entitled to one's own facts Politicians have long provided the spin. They do not get to manufacture their own facts.\nFacts are the product of rigorous research and dogged reporting. They get challenged and affirmed in the arena of ideas -- where they prove their mettle by standing up under scrutiny and cross-checking.\nLet’s stipulate that reporters don’t go into the news gathering business to be loved. Nor do they expect Valentines from the public; the messenger is often blamed for an unwelcome message.\nLet’s also stipulate that the “media” is not monolithic.\nSuggestions that the media is biased against the right need to be balanced against reality.\nThe largest cable news station is Fox News, a network largely devoted to defending the agenda of President Trump. Conservatives virtually own talk radio -- another arm of media.\nEven Fox News is alarmed Yet even on Trump-friendly Fox News, Chris Wallace told White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus that “when the president says we’re the enemy of the American people, it makes it sounds like if you are going against him (Trump), you are going against the country.”\nWallace also pointed out that “Barack Obama whined about Fox News all the time, but I got to say, he never said that we were an enemy of the people.”\nIf he had, conservatives would have lit their hair on fire.\nAn incitement to violence No American should meekly accept Trump’s attempts to put the public’s watchdog on a short leash.\nFormer George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum said Trump’s characterization of certain media outlets as enemies of the people looks “a lot like an incitement to vigilante violence.”\nThat represents a direct threat to journalists at a volatile time when the national anger can be measured by the large number of death threats The Republic received after endorsing Hillary Clinton for president.\nBut the real threat is to a system that relies on a well-informed electorate.\nDiscrediting the messenger does not serve the people. It only serves those who lack the stamina to take the criticism that comes with the job.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:25:24.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
