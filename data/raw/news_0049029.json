(Photo by Sunthorn Pongpao) - + AYUTTHAYA --All above-ground electrical wires and cables will be moved underground in Koh Muang area - an island defined by the Lop Buri, Pasak and Chao Phraya rivers - beginning in April, provincial governor Sujin Chaichumsak said on Tuesday. \nThe government had allocated a budget of nearly 300 million baht for the work, Mr Sujin said. \nThe project is part of a plan to improve the townscape of Ayutthaya, the former capital of the kingdom, a Unesco world heritage site and tourist drawcard. \nAll electrical wires and telephone cables will be moved underground, with the emphasis on ancient sites, he said. \nThe work will begin in April, in the area from Ayutthaya Historical Park to the Koh Muang island and government offices complex. \n\"We believe that when the work is completed the province's tourism image and safety will be considerably enhanced,\" the governor said. \nPeople have expressed concern that placing all electrical wiring underground could pose a danger because Ayutthaya is very prone to flooding. They emphasise that safety should be the priority. TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:09:15.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
