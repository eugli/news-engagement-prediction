We slept a little bit in between but only for a few minutes.\" Alicia Douvall, who had a six-month fling with Simon in 2001 The ex-glamour model on Loose Women in December 2016 (Photo: ITV) \nAnd that's not all – while Simon hadn't yet invented the ITV talent show that would make him a global star, he did hint at what would come. \n\"He would analyse my performance just like a judge on a TV show and say how there could be an improvement next time,\" Alicia claimed. \nIt wasn't just in the bedroom where Simon's Fifty Shades Of Grey tendencies came out, either – his wardrobe was \"immaculate\" and filled with lots of the same items of clothing.
