It comes courtesy of occultist Lauren Bowker, who runs the science-driven art house The Unseen . Bowker actually invented the dye and it's seriously amazing. According to Dazed , Bowker has used her science know-how to create color-shifting crystal headpieces for Swarovski, as well as digitalized couture clothing that can change appearance remotely via an app. Most of it is strictly art, and not necessarily practical for the real-world (though the digitized clothing is pretty sweet). Her latest invention, however, is color-changing hair dye named Fire , which is at once revolutionary and, at least in theory, user friendly. According to Bowker, the Fire dye is based on technology similar to that which makes a mood ring functional. She explains: “When heat hits the pigment, or if the cool hits the pigment, it changes the bonds of the chemistry to give you a different color, so it’s like a chemical reaction.” You May Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:44:05.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
