All 104 Lib Dem peers will vote against Article 50 and it would take only 30 Tories to do the same for Mrs May’s schedule to be sunk.\nIf the Lords refuse to pass Article 50 they will be hit with the Parliament Act, which forces legislation through.\nLording it over the public desire for Brexit?

She said: “I don’t understand why the March 31 deadline is so significant when this is such a monumental decision.”\nA detail is seen from a copy of the Brexit Article 50 bill (Photo: REUTERS) Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: “Many Tories recognise leaving the single market threatens jobs and growth.\n“They should join us in challenging it in the Lords.”\nLabour Lords leader Angela Smith vowed the issue would be fully scrutinised despite the “truncated ­timetable imposed by the Government”.\n Politics Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Politics House of Lords Tim Farron Brexit Politics", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=DailyMirror", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/530/4221396001_5307132124001_5306927444001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001"], "published": "2017-02-05T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:34:59.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
