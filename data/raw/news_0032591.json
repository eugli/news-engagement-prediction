Cheltenham Guardians attend a scene on Saturday night (Photo: Facebook) \n\"We're not sure if this is a show of bravado (think strutting peacock) or a desire not to get that Ralph Lauren shirt ripped. \n\"Imagine our surprise when two middle-aged women squared up for an altercation on the Promenade and one removed her dress and bra before fists flew. \n\"Thankfully Guardians were on hand to restore order to chaos and the bra to its semi-naked owner. \n\"It turned out that these two fighting hens were best friends. Let's hope they reflect upon their actions and deal with their differences in a more respectable way next time.\" \nYes, hopefully next time the women will keep their clothes on. Or at least head indoors before they strip off!
