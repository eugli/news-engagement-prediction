People were told clearly: 'The Government will implement what you decide. The EU referendum is a once in a generation decision.' \n“So the vote of 17.4 million people to leave was not an expression of a viewpoint, but a decision. \n“And as the former Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, put it: 'It is simply unacceptable for Parliament - for this House - not to honour its commitments.’” \nRebel Lords are expected to push back on the Bill before it is passed into law, using veto powers to demand the Government protects the rights of EU citizens in the UK and to give the two houses the final decision on May’s Brexit deal.

Fri, February 17, 2017 Much of the North East of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union including Sunderland, Gateshead, Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, and Northumberland.

The UK is committed to its course, and the decision taken by people last June 23 won't be reversed.\" \nIt comes as the Prime Minister is preparing for a tough fight as House of Lords rebels push back on her Brexit plans. GETTY Remoaners have thrown their support behind rebel Lords PARLIAMENT Lord Bridges, who voted remain, said it was time to honour the will of the people \nMrs May had announced her intention to trigger Article 50 by March but her plans could be delayed as Lords threaten to table ammendments to the Bill. \nThe strategy is being hatched by Blair ally Lord Peter Mandelson – who has said he is involved in the Open Britain think tank which is determined to keep Britain as close as possible to the crumbling Brussels bloc. \nMandelson said: “Critics say ‘what right have I, an unelected peer, to oppose this Bill or even seek to radically amend it?’ \n\"But I was appointed by my party, and in the referendum two thirds of Labour electors voted to remain. \n“That’s what I am reflecting, that’s my mandate.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T03:01:19.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
