'It's like legislating you can't be poor' \nThe president of the Law Institute of Victoria, Belinda Wilson, said the changes would effectively make sleeping rough in the city illegal. \n\"It's being very harsh on vulnerable members of our community that need longer-term solutions,\" she said. \n\"You need to look at underlying causes of homelessness: things like mental health, domestic violence, drug and alcohol.\" \nShe said the wording of the by-law was too vague and urged councillors to vote down the changes. \n\"Practically I'm not sure how this would work,\" she said. \nLaunch Housing, which has been helping to find accommodation for the rough sleepers outside Flinders Street Station, labelled the changes \"dumb policy\". \nThe organisation's chief executive, Tony Keenan, said banning rough sleeping would not solve Melbourne's homelessness problem. \n\"It makes as much sense as legislating to say you can't be poor,\" he said. \n\"We would be shifting people from the City of Melbourne to a neighbouring city which would be the City of Port Phillip or the City of Yarra.\" \nHe said forcing the homeless away from busy, well-lit city streets would put their safety at risk. \n\"More risk of assaults, more risk of injuries, more risk of people dying on the streets,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:38:31.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
