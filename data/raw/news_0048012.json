By khal resident old | @ khal\n Over the last few years, Alex Trebek and Jeopardy! in general has been showing love to the worlds of hip-hop and R&B. In the past couple of years, we&apos;ve seen the likes of Kanye West&apos;s Life of Pablo , Drake , Chance the Rapper , and other hip-hop luminaries become answers on the Jeopardy! screen, and Trebek&apos;s gone viral for having to recite, say, the hook for Rihanna&apos;s \"Umbrella\" or the theme song to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Airâ€‹ . Last night, though, he upped the ante.\nRelated Alex Trebek Sings Rihanna's 'Umbrella' and Kills It Alex Trebek Rapped the 'Fresh Prince' Theme Song on 'Jeopardy' This 'Jeopardy!'
