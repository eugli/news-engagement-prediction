As reported on Inquirer, Uson recently made headlines for expressing her opinion about censorship via Facebook, prior to her meeting with the MTRCB. The former Mocha Girls member expressed her protest against 'overly graphic scenes' airing on television, and used the aforementioned show and the Shaina Magdayao drama, \"The Better Half\" as examples. She also used the word \"garbage\" and \"obscene\" to describe the rape scenes on \"Ipaglaban Mo\", and threatened to resign if she fails to convince the MTRCB members to stop airing such scenes. Expressing his frustration with Uson's words, Guzman recently published a long post online, saying that they should handle the matter through the correct process if she has any complaints about the show, rather than airing it online. The actor also reminded Uson that her past films such as \"Butas 2\" and \"Seksing Masahista\" can be considered worse than the particular \"Ipaglaban Mo\" episode she was talking about. He ended his statement by saying, \"Please show a little bit of respect to Filipino artistes, and to respect due process considering her status in the MTRCB\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:38:47.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
