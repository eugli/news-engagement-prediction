Pin \nAt the hospital, Hayden calls around looking for Finn and realizes he’s been hiding for him. Down the hall, Robin drops in to visit her mother. She takes off, and takes the guard at the door with her. Olivia steps off the elevator and learns which room Anna is in. She strolls over and whips out a switchblade. Before she can do anything, Robin returns and Liv takes off, vowing to kill Devane eventually. Robin fills the guard in on Anna’s condition. He says she’s lucky to have such a caring daughter. Dr. Scorpio returns to her mother and tells her that she’s expecting another baby. Anna’s amazed. \nNina and Valentin sit down at the Metro Court dining room. She wonders if they should leave after she spots Laura. He hopes Lulu shows up and makes a scene. Dante arrives and asks him down to the station. Nina explains she filed a complaint against Anna for breaking into the house. The Cassadine doesn’t want charges pressed but Nina insists. The couple asks Dante to step aside and then argue. Nina asks him if he has feelings for the other woman. He insists those feelings are in the past. Valentin asks her to support him on dropping the charges, calls the cop over and gives him his decision. Nina asks for some time alone. Meanwhile, Alexis sits down with Laura. She announces that she’s in AA and has to make amends for hurting her by not giving her competent legal advice. Laura insists only Valentin was to blame. Rudge has been watching and ‘accidentally’ knocks over her bag. As he picks it up, he drugs her coffee. She drinks it down. Across the room, Liv joins Alexis to discuss her progress. When the lawyer gets a call, Liv slips something into her purse. Alexis returns and fills her in about the safety deposit box that Julian left for her. She’s sure it would answer a lot of questions. Liv makes her promise to take her along if she accesses the box. \nNew: See the stars of GH recreating scenes from Oscar nominated films \nIn his room, Finn notices Hayden has sent him eight texts. She bursts in and starts searching for drugs. Some are soon found. Cold turkey wasn’t an option for him. Hayden’s determined to get him help. The doctor promises to go to rehab in 30 days if he hasn’t quit. She doesn’t buy it. He admits that he’s an addict but he loves her. She’s taken aback but thinks he just said that to get her to back off. She’s done with this and leaves. \nBack at the hospital, Valentin pays a visit to Anna’s room and informs her that he’s dropped the charges. “You owe me more than you know,” he cryptically says, before walking out. Robin returns. Her mom has no clue why the man was there. Meanwhile, Lucy walks into the board room and tells Tracy GH is dying today. They argue about it until Lucy leaves. \nMore: Jenna Dewan Tatum to co-host Jennifer Lopez’s World of Dance \nLaura drives to the hospital parking lot and passes out as she opens her car door. Rudge finds her. Liv joins them and tells her henchman to take Laura for a long drive. \nSam wakes up in the ravine after being shoved down by Olivia. She sits up. The baby starts kicking. After a few minutes, Sam tries scaling the wall but falls. \nJason and Curtis arrive at the Jerome mausoleum and pry open the door. Curtis is creeped out and Jason is cracking jokes. As they bicker, they jiggle the lid with their crowbars until it comes loose. It’s empty. \nJust In: Craig Robinson to The Talk \nCurtis and Jason go to the Metro Court bar. Jason thinks they have an advantage over Olivia now. Curtis quickly downs a drink. He doesn’t know if he should call the cops or leave this to him. After he takes off, Alexis sits down with Jason. Neither of them know where Sam is. \nSonny is feeling optimistic about his future with Carly. \nJulian has a lucky day. \nFinn tries to make amends to Hayden. \nLaura doesn’t come through for Tracy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:23:46.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
