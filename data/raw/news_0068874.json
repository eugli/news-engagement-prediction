After an extensive search, their bodies were found the next day along a railroad bridge near Deer Creek. Indiana State Police circulated this photo of a man who is believed to be a suspect in the double homicide. Law enforcement agents last week released a grainy photo of a suspect: a white man wearing blue jeans, a blue coat and a hoodie. They are still trying to identify him and have said there may be other suspects. Police on Wednesday said the source of that photo was a video German had taken on her cell phone. Officials also released audio of a male voice saying the words \"down the hill,\" in the hopes the public might identify the suspect's voice.

Bursten praised German for having the \"presence of mind to turn on her video camera,\" later calling her a \"hero.\" Officials want anyone with information to call their tip line , and said there was a reward of as much as $41,000.
