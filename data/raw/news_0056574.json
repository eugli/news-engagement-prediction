And that's partly because the news channels upset him, but mostly because he's now bought over 300 NutriBullets.\" –Conan O'Brien \n\"President Trump announced he will nominate a new Supreme Court Justice sometime next week. Trump said, 'I just need a few more days to come up with someone completely unqualified.'\" –Conan O'Brien \n\"It is true, I'm not making this up, he did call his inauguration day 'A National Day of Patriotic Devotion.' So today, Trump was accused of fascism by Democrats and plagiarism by Kim Jong Un.\" –Conan O'Brien \n\"The Oscar nominations came out today and the movie 'La La Land' got 14 nominations.

However, today it was explained to him that 'that's just how Irish people dance.'\" –Conan O'Brien \n\"President Trump got his first approval rating numbers and they aren't good.

It's not so much a lie as it is a symptom.\" –Jimmy Kimmel \n\"Following President Trump's inauguration, the White House website no longer has an option for translation into Spanish. So, sorry, Mexican immigrants, if you want to live here, you'll just have to learn to speak Russian.\" –Seth Meyers \n\"President Trump today met with the leaders of Fiat, Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors.

This book's tentative title is 'Happy Now, [Jerks]?'\" –Conan O'Brien \n\"President Trump did draw a huge crowd over the weekend.

Adding, 'Nice to see you all come out in full force, finally.'\" –Seth Meyers \nJan. 19, 2017 \"Tomorrow is the presidential inauguration. People from all across country will be there. But don't worry if you can't make it, because the president will be live tweeting the whole thing.\" –Jimmy Fallon \n\"Donald Trump apparently wrote a draft of his inauguration speech himself. A little worried though, because while he was writing, he kept yelling to his secretary, 'Is boobs spelled with two 'o's or three?'\" –Jimmy Fallon \n\"Now, Trump likes writing everything by hand and he actually threw away some lines for his speech that he decided not to use. Well, we got a hold of some of them. So check these out: This first line Trump threw away was 'Four score and seven bankruptcies ago.' Then he tried, 'Read my lips.

Which raises the question, why can't we be more like Gambia?\" –Conan O'Brien \n\"Today, in his last full day in office, President Obama commuted the sentences of 330 prisoners. After hearing this, Melania Trump said, 'I hope I'm one of them.'\" –Conan O'Brien \n\"Meteorologists are predicting that the weather for the inauguration tomorrow will be cold, damp, and dreary. However, things will warm up later in the afternoon, during the Rapture.\" –Conan O'Brien \n\"Today is President Obama's final day in office, and I just want to say: Mr. President, you weren't great for comedy.

So, on behalf of comedians and talk show hosts everywhere: We're gonna miss you, Joe!\" –Conan O'Brien \n\"President Obama surprised his White House staffers with a private concert by Bruce Springsteen to thank them for their work over the last eight years.

It could go either way.\" –Conan O'Brien \n\"It was announced that the B Street Band — a Bruce Springsteen cover band — that was booked for an inauguration gala has since decided to cancel out of respect for Springsteen's opposition to Donald Trump. You know it's bad when even a cover band is like, 'We don't want to compromise our artistic integrity like that.'\" –James Corden \n\"The celebrities attending are so non-famous, they'd probably get cast on 'Celebrity Apprentice.'\" –James Corden \n\"Maybe a Springsteen cover band canceling is all for the best.

That is so sad. I mean, they've gone from 'Heil!' to 'Huh?'\" –Stephen Colbert \nJan. 16, 2017 \"I saw that Donald Trump himself is selling inauguration sweatshirts for $79.

Meanwhile, Trump's toupee and Harvey's mustache met for a play date.\" –Conan O'Brien \n\"Donald Trump observed the holiday by visiting the National Museum of African American History, or more accurately, canceling his visit to the National Museum of African American History.

Apparently, the circus doesn't think it could compete against a Trump presidency.\" –Stephen Colbert \nJan. 12, 2017 \n\"All of these accusations are coming out about Trump's ties with Russia.

After seven hours of debating, they voted to approve a resolution that would rid the country eventually of Obamacare.

How would Congress like it if we all met in the middle of the night and voted to take THEIR healthcare away?\" –Jimmy Kimmel \n\"If Obamacare is repealed, 20 million Americans could lose healthcare which is a very big deal, but we don't seem to be as fired up.

You know, cleaning out his desk, handing over the keys, and spackling over the holes in the office wall so he can get the security deposit back, squeeze a little toothpaste in there.\" –Stephen Colbert \n\"There's these allegations that Russia has compromising information on Donald Trump. It's all based on 35 pages of opposition research that was evidently put together by a British MI6 agent. Yesterday, we didn't know his name, and now we know his name is Steele — Christopher Steele. So, a Brit spy named Steele? Is he Remington Steele's cousin?\" –Stephen Colbert \nJan. 11, 2017 \"Donald and Melania Trump are scheduled to ride with the Obamas to the Capitol on Inauguration Day. And you thought your Uber pool was uncomfortable.\" –Jimmy Fallon \n\"Obama offered to leave behind the swing set that he had installed for his kids so that Trump's grandkids could use it, but Trump turned him down. Trump said he'll be building a bigger, better swing set and he's going to make the kids pay for it.\" –Jimmy Fallon \n\"The big story right now is the new report claiming that Russia has enough embarrassing material on Donald Trump to blackmail him. On the other hand, so does anyone who follows Trump on Twitter.\" –Jimmy Fallon \n\"There will be a '20/20' special on Trump's inauguration that has forced ABC to push back its premieres of 'Scandal' and 'How to Get Away With Murder.'

In response, Donald Trump said being a father to his daughter is the reason he's not allowed to date her.\" –Conan O'Brien \n\"CNN reported that last Friday intelligence chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts compromise him.

Trump received these documents as part of his intelligence briefing, so we know one thing for sure: He didn't read them.\" –Stephen Colbert \n\"Trump immediately denied the report, tweeting, 'Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to leak into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?' So true — we all remember how unfair Nazi Germany was to their charismatic leader. Those people were always going 'Talk to the hand!'\" –Stephen Colbert \nJan. 10, 2017 \"President Obama gave his farewell address tonight in Chicago and thousands of people waited outside in freezing temperatures to get tickets.
