Article continues below \nHowever, looking to other faces on the F1 circuit throws several names into the mix - with the obvious suggestion of Sebastian Vettel considered alongside Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen in also challenging for the title of world's best, unlike Messi and Ronaldo's dominance in football. \nOn the current grid, three drivers are right up there in terms of all-time race wins, with Hamilton 2nd on 53, Vettel 4th on 42, and Alonso 6th with 32.

Fernando is a fighter and has so much experience, he's always more difficult than the others. He's an old dog who knows everything\". \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
