Photo by Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images Of all Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks, it’s hard to find anyone who’s more outwardly hostile toward the agency he’s been tapped to lead than Scott Pruitt has been toward the Environmental Protection Agency. The Oklahoma attorney general makes no secret of this; his official bio page calls him “a leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda.” Over the past six years, Pruitt has filed lawsuit after (mostly unsuccessful) lawsuit to halt EPA rules on mercury pollution from coal plants, to thwart EPA plans to clean up the Chesapeake Bay, to block President Barack Obama’s efforts to tackle climate change — and much, much more. Pruitt’s record is so stark that nearly 800 former EPA employees signed on to a letter stridently opposing his confirmation — and they’ve been calling up their senators to vote against him. The letter highlighted Pruitt’s cozy ties with Oklahoma’s oil and gas industry ; his opposition to the federal government regulating air pollution that crosses state lines; and his history of downplaying global warming. “Mr. Pruitt’s record,” it states, “raises serious questions about whose interests he has served to date and whether he agrees with the longstanding tenets of U.S. environmental law.” None of this has been enough to derail Pruitt’s nomination. Trump wanted an EPA head who would roll back Obama’s climate policies. And the modern-day GOP is in sync with Pruitt’s views on environmental regulation — namely, that the feds should do far less of it. (Susan Collins of Maine was the only Senate Republican worried that Pruitt’s past appeared at odds with the EPA’s stated mission of protecting the environment and public health.) Pruitt has strong support among industry groups and conservatives. So, on Friday afternoon, Pruitt will be narrowly confirmed — with support from 51 Senate Republicans and two Democrats (Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp). Democrats tried to delay the vote until after Oklahoma releases Pruitt’s email correspondence with the fossil-fuel industry next Tuesday, but they don’t have the numbers. The real question now is how far Pruitt can actually go to reshape the nation’s environmental policies. It’s possible that he’ll face intractable obstacles in trying to cut back and downsize the EPA over the next few years, hemmed in by various legal constraints. But it’s also possible that he could tear up the EPA’s climate policies and make it much, much tougher for both the United States and the world to tackle global warming for years to come. If the latter comes to pass, Pruitt could easily end up being one of Donald Trump’s most consequential Cabinet picks. Pruitt will have a lot of power to change the EPA — but also faces serious obstacles Obama’s first EPA administrator, Lisa Jackson. Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The EPA is one of America’s most far-reaching regulatory bodies, tasked with enforcing laws on everything from air pollution to chemical safety. It’s guided by major statutes like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act , which often require the agency to update its regulations regularly to reflect new science on pollution and public health. The EPA’s political leadership has somelatitude in deciding whether these rules should be stronger or weaker, but they have to work within the confines of those statutes. Under President George W. Bush, the EPA tried to issue relatively lax rules on smog and mercury pollution . But green groups sued and those efforts got smacked down in court. The Obama administration later issued more stringent smog and mercury rules, as well as ratcheting up dozens of other regulations, particularly on coal plants. The EPA is also currently the key US agency dealing with climate change. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA had authorityto regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act if it determined they pose a threat to public health or welfare. Obama’s EPA determined they do pose a threat , and went about enacting a flurry of climate policies : stricter fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks; limits on CO2 from new and existing power plants; regulations on methane leaks from oil drilling. Pruitt clearly thinks Obama’s EPA went too far on these fronts, arguing at his Senate confirmation hearing that the agency “became dissatisfied with the tools Congress had given it … and bootstrapped its own powers and tools through rule-making.” Over the past six years, the courts have usually disagreed, rejecting many of Pruitt’s lawsuits and upholding EPA actions. But as EPA administrator, he’ll now have much greater leeway to set policy. Here are a few broad actions he can take: Rewrite and weaken some of Obama’s EPA rules. Rewriting existing EPA regulations is a tricky, multiyear process that requires going through formal rule-making procedures. But Pruitt could, for instance, revamp Obama’s Clean Power Plan to require far less extensive CO2 cuts from power plants. He could redo the EPA’s “Waters of the US” rule so that the Clean Water Act applied to fewer streams and wetlands. Because rewriting rules is so time-intensive, “there’s limited bandwidth here,” says Jeffrey Holmstead, a top EPA official in the George W. Bush administration. “But if I had to guess, I’d guess they get a couple of these big changes done.” Delay the development of new rules. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA is eventually supposed to regulate other sources of greenhouse-gas emissions beyond cars and power plants — including refineries, chemical plants, and so on. Pruitt could delay the introduction of additional climate rules indefinitely. Scale back enforcement of existing regulations. As Attorney General of Oklahoma, Pruitt disbanded the state’s Environmental Enforcement Unit. At the EPA, he could direct the agency to be less aggressive about investigating companies for pollution violations, bringing fewer cases to the Department of Justice. Give more deference to the states. Many US pollution rules are developed by the EPA but implemented by state agencies — the EPA approves state implementation plans and steps in if they’re not being assertive enough. Pruitt has long insisted he’d like the EPA to be more deferential to state agencies, an approach he calls “cooperative federalism.” Critics of this approach worry that state agencies are often overly lenient on industry, and that states struggle to deal with pollution that crosses state lines. Change the way the EPA uses science. The EPA’s scientific advisory boards are tasked with synthesizing the latest science on pollution and public health so that regulations can be updated regularly, as the law requires. The Bush administration tended to stock these advisory boards with more industry-friendly voices — and sometimes ignored their recommendations altogether . This will be something to watch in Pruitt’s EPA. Push to shrink the EPA’s budget. Pruitt will also help shape the Trump administration’s budget requests to Congress, and he could ask for significant budget cuts.Republican lawmakers have long signaled they’d be happy to oblige — and this would further hamstring the agency’s ability to enforce regulations and develop new rules. (Congress has already been whittling down the EPA’s budget since 2011, and prosecutions for environmental crimes have fallen by half during that time .) Now, there are limits to how far Pruitt can go. If his EPA starts missing statutory deadlines, or sidesteps rule-making procedures, or issues rules wildly out of step with what the Clean Air Act requires, he’ll be stopped in court. America’s environmental laws are unique in offering ample opportunity for outside groups to sue, and green groups like the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council are deft in using this to their advantage — they blocked dozens of Bush and Reagan-era deregulatory moves. So, for instance, it’s unlikely that Pruitt could tear up the EPA’s Endangerment Finding , the 2009 analysis establishing that greenhouse gases were a threat and therefore need to be regulated, without Congress. “That has a voluminous scientific foundation behind it,” said Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor and former Obama climate adviser. “The Trump administration couldn’t just come in and say nope, no more endangerment! There’s almost no chance that would be upheld [in court].” But Pruitt is familiar with environmental laws and is likely to pick his battles carefully, says Holmstead. And green groups won’t be able stop everything he might want to do — like pulling back on environmental enforcement at oil and gas facilities (something Obama’s EPA prioritized). “It’s extremely difficult to challenge an agency on enforcement decisions,” says Emily Hammond, a law professor at George Washington University. “Courts tend to treat that like prosecutorial discretion.” Pruitt’s most sweeping impact could be on climate change policy Tick tock. Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images If you want to see how Pruitt’s tenure at the EPA might play out, you could do worse than read this New York Times piece from 1989, written at the end of Ronald Reagan’s presidency. Like Trump, Reagan came to office planning to dismantle the EPA and hack away at regulations on industry. Environmentalists feared the worst, as they do with Pruitt now. Things didn’t exactly work that way. As Philip Shabecoff wrote in his Times look-back, the end result after eight years was a “stalemate.” To the disappointment of many conservatives, Reagan didn’tradically reshape the EPA, in part because his political appointees made some serious missteps, in part because they were beaten back in court. The agency was left “more or less intact.” Yet Reagan’s appointees still had a real impact: “Environmental and conservation agencies were starved for money, the agencies were politicized and their staffs were demoralized, critics say. Worst of all, they say, the Government deliberately delayed attacking long-term problems like global warming linked to pollution, acid rain, toxic waste, air pollution and the contamination of underground water supplies.” A similar four- or eight-year delay today could prove even more fateful — thanks to the growing urgency around global warming. After years of dithering on climate policy, the world now has precious little time to slash emissions and avoid what world leaders consider a dangerous 2°C or even 3°C rise in global average temperatures. During the Obama years, the US and the rest of the world were starting to make slow, fragile process on addressing this issue. The Obama administration set a goal of cutting US emissions at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and hoped that various EPA rules — including the Clean Power Plan and limits on methane leaks — would get us there. These rules helped underpin the Paris climate agreement , under which all countries agreed to tackle their own emissions and ratchet up ambitions over time. Tax Policy Center)\" data-chorus-optimize-field=\"main_image\"> ( Tax Policy Center ) Trump and Pruitt, of course, want to roll many of those EPA rules back. Obama’s version of the Clean Power Plan (which is currently being challenged in court) would’ve prodded many states to shift from coal to cleaner gas and renewables. Pruitt’s version might merely require coal plants to slightly improve their heat-rate efficiency , leading to far fewer emission cuts. Similarly, Pruitt has suggested he might block California’s request to strengthen its clean-car rules under the Clean Air Act — rules that have had a big impact on the US electric-car market. And so on. It’s hard to predict exactly how much these actions will matter. One possibility is that they won’t. Perhaps states will continue to shift away from coal and invest in renewablesat a rapid clip, partly for economic reasons and partly because they know carbon cuts are inevitable. (Emily Holden of E&E News has a great interview with an Arkansas regulator who notes that utilities are planning CO2 cuts because they expect the next president after Trump will push for stricter climate rules.) Perhaps electric cars will continue to catch on, as battery prices drop. But it’s also quite plausible that Pruitt’s tenure at EPA could derail momentum on decarbonization in a way that will have sweeping, long-term implications. Perhaps he works with Congress to strip away the EPA’s authority over greenhouse gases once and for all , so that no future president can act. Perhaps the US fails so miserably to hit its emissions targets that other countries start winding back their own climate ambitions, leading to a hotter planet overall. The future here is uncertain; there are so many different factors at play. But it’s not totally inconceivable that, decades from now, we could look back and see Scott Pruitt as one of Trump’s most consequential Cabinet picks. Further reading 5 possible futures for the EPA under Trump . This piece gets into some of what Congress might do to downsize the agency. This interview with Jody Freeman is a deep dive into all the obstacles and procedural hurdles that Trump and Pruitt will face in dismantling Obama’s EPA rules. Here’s a more pessimistic piece on the prospects for tackling climate change under Trump. While solar and wind may grow and the coal industry may keep shrinking no matter what Pruitt does, the prospects for deep decarbonization now look much dimmer. Chris Mooney of the Washington Post has a good piece looking at how US inaction on climate change might affect what other countries do — and hence overall global temperatures. As you might guess, lots of variables here.
