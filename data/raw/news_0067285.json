It's just awful that people could behave like that,\" replied Archbishop Philip Wilson, from Adelaide. \n\"We've heard that many times,\" said Mr Murray. Celibacy 'a gift' \nArchbishop Denis Hart, who is the president of the Bishops Conference, asked that potential priests avoid joining the church if they could not embrace celibacy. \n\"Celibacy seen as a burden runs the risk of turning in on oneself and would feed any immaturity or lack of balance in the person,\" Archbishop Hart said. \n\"If they just go to the priesthood and they don't think of all that's implied and they're not educated or supported to see what's implied, then we're in dangerous territory. \n\"The only legitimate way in which celibacy can be lived is lived as a gift with someone who freely and totally embraces it, and given that celibacy is necessary for ordination I would say to anyone if you can't see celibacy as not putting something aside, but as embracing, in imitation of Christ, a love of a whole range of other people rather than a particular commitment of marriage, please, please don't go forward to the priesthood.\" \nArchbishop Hart, alongside his four colleagues, admitted that celibacy was a factor in the child sexual abuse seen in the church, although they would not say it was the cause. \n\"In a person who hasn't got the capacity to embrace celibacy…where there are weaknesses there then I'd have to admit that the capacity or probability of abuse is certainly increased.\" \nThe commission hearing into the Catholic church continues.
