Mesut Ozil suffering CRISIS of confidence, admits Arsenal boss Wenger \nThe 27-year-old started the season in decent fashion but his downturn in performances has coincided with the Gunners’ slump and he’s come in for fierce criticism. \nWenger, too, has had his position questioned in the last fortnight but he insists individuals are not to blame for the club’s form. Wenger says Arsenal’s squad as a whole must bear the brunt of their slump (Picture: Getty) \n‘The team wins and the team loses. When you win sometimes some players are singled out as they are treated like exceptional players, but when you don’t do well sometimes just focus a little bit more on the team aspect and not try to blame each other,’ said Wenger. ‘The blame culture is part of the perception of people, but what is important is that we show a united front. ‘We have a good opportunity to show that we are a united, strong unit and that we bounce back. ‘When you don’t win you cannot as well say that all is well. You have to analyse that something is not right. It is our job to find where and to have a strong united response.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:41:21.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
