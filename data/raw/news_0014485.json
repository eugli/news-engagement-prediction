The 'Fighter' hitmaker has taken to her Twitter account to share a picture of herself sat at her piano while writing the lyrics for her first studio album since 2012's Lotus, and has teased that it will be personal record as she said it's from her 'heart.' Alongside the professional photo, she wrote: 'Finishing touches to my heart.' New music soon! Christina Aguilera tweeted a photo of herself on Wednesday that shows her on the piano while apparently finishing up some songs for her new album Aside from sharing a picture on her Instagram account last year of her taking pen-to-paper in a mystery recording studio, the 36-year-old pop superstar last spoke of a new record in 2014 when she revealed she'd teamed up with Pharrell Williams - who she worked with on the American version of The Voice - and was very keen on one of the tracks he'd had suggested. Christina previously said: 'During my pregnancy, I had a meeting with [Pharrell] and just connected on where I want to take the next album.' 'And we started talking music, and he has one song in particular that I love.' With the guys: The blonde bombshell gained more popularity when she was a judge on The Voice. Here she is with the other judges Adam Levine (left), Pharrell Williams (second from left) and Blake Shelton (right) in West Hollywood, California in April 2016 The 'Beautiful' singer said she wanted to ensure her record is 'genuine' before she releases it and is determined to 'pour' her heart into it. Christina - who has two children Max, nine, and two-year-old daughter Summer from two separate relationships - said previously: 'I just have to make sure it is right and it is genuine and heartfelt. I'm very excited to pour my heart out into this record fully.' The Grammy winner was married to Jordan Bratman from 2005 until 2011. He is the father of Max; the father of Summer is Christina's fiance Matthew D. Rutler. She's still got it: The superstar performed in Moscow, Russia in December 2016 for the first Russian National Music Awards ceremony In 2015, Christina told Entertainment Tonight that she was working on new music, but wasn't going to rush anything. 'I really value the creative process and the time it takes,' she said. 'I am working with some incredible new people that, even I'm surprised [to be working with], and then also re-joining with some dear friends of mine, collaborators [like] the beautiful Linda Perry.'
