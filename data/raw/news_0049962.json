The unexpected mini-performances were the result of a new category called “Let’s Rap, Kids!” for the show’s College Championship, which continues through Friday. \n“They mad they ain’t famous,” rapped Trebek, 76, at one point, delivering lines from West’s 2016 single “Famous” in his signature deep voice. “They mad they still nameless…But we still hood famous. Yeah, we still hood famous.” \nJulia, a contestant who couldn’t help but smile while watching Trebek rap, quickly answered, “Who is Kanye West?” Trebek replied, “Yes, and I hope we don’t get an email from him.” \nTrebek later revealed his thoughts on his rap skills, telling the audience, “I was just getting into this rap thing. I’m not too good at it, but I was getting into it!” How about Alex Trebek rapping on Jeopardy! tonight pic.twitter.com/MNy9CEkf1p \n— Kenny Ducey (@KennyDucey) February 21, 2017 Here's Alex Trebek rapping on @Jeopardy for those of you not watching 😂 pic.twitter.com/FANczhVSl7", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:13:43.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
