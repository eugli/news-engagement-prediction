Credit: UTV \nThe UK Government has pledged £3.8million to subsidise an air route between Londonderry and London. \nIt follows the decision by current operator Ryanair to stop serving the air link at the end of March. \nBMI Regional has been chosen as the preferred operator for the route between City of Derry Airport and London Stansted, following a competitive tender process by Derry City & Strabane District Council. \nThe airline will take over flights from Sunday 26 March and the government will fund the route over the 2017/18 and 2018/19 financial years. \nThe new service will include two return flights each day, except for Saturdays which will have one flight each way. \nNorthern Ireland Secretary of State James Brokenshire said: “The UK Government has worked closely with Derry City and Strabane District Council to protect this important route to City of Derry Airport. \n“£3.8million UK Government funding will allow 13 return flights to connect Londonderry to London every week. The new service will allow business passengers to get to central London and complete a full day’s work before returning home.” \nIt is the first ever government backing for a public service obligation (PSO) in Northern Ireland. \nThe funding has been drawn from the Government's Regional Air Connectivity Fund, which can be used to protect regional air connections to London which may otherwise be lost. \nLast year, the Northern Ireland Executive pledged £7million to help support Londonderry's troubled airport.
