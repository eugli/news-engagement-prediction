The show was originally slated to conclude on March 7, but due to the Trump programming the penultimate episode will air that week and the final episode of Season 1 will air on March 14. The show will remain at 9/8c. \nThis Is Us : Is Rebecca to blame for the end of the Pearson marriage? \nThis Is Us isn't the only NBC show getting the boot to accommodate Trump's speech. The premiere of John Lithgow 's new comedy, Trial & Error , is also getting pushed a week to March 14 after the This Is Us finale. A new episode of Chicago Justice will air after the This Is Us penultimate episode. \nThe NBC drama will air at its normal time next week though, as Kevin ( Justin Hartley ) prepares for the premiere of his play, Randall ( Sterling K. Brown ) struggles with both personal and professional pressure and Jack ( Milo Ventimiglia ) and Rebecca ( Mandy Moore ) don't have the Valentine's Day they were hoping for. \nThis Is Us continues Tuesdays at 9/8c on NBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:30:50.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
