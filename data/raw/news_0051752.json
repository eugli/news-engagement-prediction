He says: 'As surgeons we have a duty to inform people that bodies come in all shapes and sizes, and there’s really no such thing as normal. 'This is of even greater importance when dealing with young women whose bodies are likely to still be developing.' According to figures from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery almost 100,000 women across the world underwent labiaplasty surgery in 2015. Popular: 'Women over the age of 18 should be allowed to make their own decisions about their bodies,' Dr Navid Jallali proclaims Join the club: According to figures from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery almost 100,000 women across the world underwent labiaplasty surgery in 2015 In the UK alone labiaplasty popularity has soared with most recent figures from the NHS indicating 2,000 women in the UK underwent a labiaplasty in 2010. The figures represent a fivefold increase in 10 years. Dr Jallali says only about half of the women who present to him for labiaplasty are suitable for the operation, compared to only around five to 10 per cent who are unsuitable for other surgeries. WHAT IS A LABIAPLASTY? A labiaplasty is a surgical procedure to reduce the size of the labia minora – the flaps of skin either side of the vaginal opening. It involves shortening or reshaping the vaginal lips, a bit like shortening a hem on a dress. It is usually performed by a gynaecologist or plastic surgeon. The unwanted tissue is cut away with a scalpel or possibly a laser, and the loose edge may be stitched up with fine, dissolvable stitches. It can be carried out using either a general anaesthetic or local anaesthetic with sedation, and the whole procedure takes about one to two hours. However there is a lack of research investigating how effective this procedure is. This means there's no guarantee it will achieve a long-lasting desired effect, and there are short- and long-term risks to consider. Source: NHS Choices But for those where a need is established, Dr Jalalli says people who dismiss the surgery as 'vain' are discouraging women who will actually benefit. He continued: 'Reasons for the surgery can vary from difficulties during sexual intercourse to not being able to exercise because their labia is so large. 'Some patients are unable to wear tight clothing, and some don’t have intimate relationships at all because they are embarrassed of the appearance.' Mr Jallali says he carried out 10 labiasplasty procedures in 2013 and 70 in 2016. The ages of the women varied from 18 to 35. Surgery can cost between £2,500 and £4,000 and involves using either a scalpel or laser to cut away unwanted tissue. Mr Jallali says: 'The most important thing is to consider the surgery in detail, do thorough research and think about the risks. No surgery should be undertaken on a whim. 'It’s important to remember that bodies come in all shapes and sizes and all reputable surgeons will explore the patient’s motivations and expectations before agreeing to carry out any work.'
