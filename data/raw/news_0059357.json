During this phase, 52 seats will go to polls. Political slugfest is already begun on BJP president Amit Shah ’s controversial ‘KASAB’ remark. Shah was slammed by Mayawati and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for his statement with the BSP supremo going to the extent of calling the BJP chief a “terrorist”. In a stinging retaliation to the BJP president’s remark made, Mayawati said there “cannot be a bigger Kasab” than Shah. Hitting out at Shah, Akhilesh said, “BJP people have lost the battle on the ground and so their language has changed.” Shah had used the acronym ‘KASAB’, saying ‘Ka’ (in Hindi) stands for Congress, ‘Sa’ for Samajwadi Party and ‘Ba’ for BSP. He had said that till KASAB is laid to rest, UP will not have development. \nThe fourth phase of polling for 53 assembly constituencies of Uttar Pradesh had passed off amid stray incidents of violence on February 23, with an estimated over 61 per cent voter turnout. This phase of voting was crucial for the state’s ruling Samajwadi Party and main opposition BSP, both major contenders for power this time too, as they had won nearly 40 of these seats in the previous polls. 680 candidates, including 61 women, were in the fray for 53 seats. In the 2012 Assebmly polls, Samajwadi Party had won 24, BSP 15, Congress six, BJP five and others three seats.
