After opening in the green, both the Sensex and Nifty see-sawed between red and green in a tight band in the run-up to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley 's speech in Parliament. \n\nThe rupee also added a bit of positivity to Budget 2017 day, appreciating 24 paise, to Rs 67.63 to the dollar. \n\nThe 30-stock BSE benchmark Sensex had lost 226 points in the two trading days before the Budget speech. \n\nThe positive opening of both key indices was reflected across the breadth of the markets, in the smallcap and midcap indices as well. \n\nThe positive sentiment on the morning of Budget 2017 has been attributed to hopes of an investor-friendly budget. The gains were driven by realty, PSUs, oil and gas, capital goods, consumer durables and banking stocks. \n\nThe positive mood also held line with most international trends. Stock markets in the Asia Pacific region with the exception of Honk Kong's Hang Seng - Japan's Nikkei, South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P ASX - were all in the positive. \n\nThe US Dow Jones Industrial Average had closed 0.54 per cent lower in the early hours of Wednesday. \n\nGold prices fell on Wednesday morning, with futures contracting by Rs 87, to Rs 28,705 per 10 grams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T08:12:40.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
