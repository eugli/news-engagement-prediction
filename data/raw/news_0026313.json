You will not only tell them you were at the most incredible Fourth of July celebration of your own but also provide them with Tom’s backstory of just where that tank came from. In a new interview with GQ , Tom talks about Taylor in great detail. For starters, he calls her an “amazing woman,” adding that she’s “generous and kind and lovely” and that #Hiddleswift generally was “the best time.” Perhaps haunted by the many conspiracy theories that plagued their relationship for the better part of 2016 , Tom also says, “Of course it was real.” Getty Of the tank top, which Tom sported during last year’s Fourth of July extravaganza at Taylor’s house, here’s the truth: Tom slipped and hurt his back from “playing a game” and to protect his skin injury from the Rhode Island sunshine, Tom asked around for a shirt: “And one of her friends said, ‘I’ve got this.’ And we all laughed about it. It was a joke… It was a joke, among friends,” he tells GQ. Does this mean there are multiple “I ♥ T.S.” tanks? Is this something one gets when they official join the squad? Is Ed Sheeran hoarding boxes of these tanks at his house? Elsewhere in the interview, which by the way, only makes me want to have Bolognese for lunch and dinner, Tom gets even deeper and offers prime intel on what it’s like to date as a famous: Advertisement - Continue Reading Below I have to be so psychologically strong about not letting other people’s interpretations about my life affect my life. A relationship exists between two people. We will always know what it was. The narratives that are out there altogether have been extrapolated from pictures that were taken without consent or permission, with no context. Nobody had the context for that story. And I’m still trying to work out a way of having a personal life and protecting it, but also without hiding. So the hardest thing is that that was a joke among friends on the Fourth of July. He goes on to explain that he only knows the “woman I met” and that Taylor is “incredible.” During their courtship, Tom says he and Taylor both craved regular things: “So we decided to go out for dinner, we decided to travel.” If you don't have plans for lunch today, do take some time to read GQ 's opus (Tom Hanks is mentioned several times and T.Hidds' post-interview visit is a treat). Unfortunately, I'm still waiting for his explanation on the second-most famous photo of their relationship: 🇺🇸 A photo posted by Britany LaManna (@britmaack) on Jul 5, 2016 at 12:11pm PDT Follow Peggy on Twitter .
