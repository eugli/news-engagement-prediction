(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  39PM EST Last Updated Sunday, February 5, 2017 4:45PM EST \nHOUSTON -- The Latest on Super Bowl 51 (all times local): \n3:15 p.m. \nIf you're without a device in New York City and need an update on who's winning the Super Bowl, find the Empire State Building. \nAt kickoff at Houston's NRG Stadium, the famous tower in Manhattan will be split between the colours of the New England Patriots (blue, red and white) and the Atlanta Falcons (red and black). When each team scores, the building will sparkle in that team's colours. It will remain lit in the colours of the team with the lead. \nAfter the game, the winning team's colours will sparkle for an hour before remaining lit in those colours until sunrise. \nThe Empire State Building did the same thing a year ago when Denver beat Carolina last year. \n2 p.m. \nFans started entering NRG Stadium four hours before the Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons. \nThe Patriots are going for their fifth Super Bowl in the Tom Brady-Bill Belichick era. A win would give Brady the most Super Bowls in league history, breaking a tie with Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw. \nThe Patriots have overcome Brady's four-game \"Deflategate\" suspension, star tight end Rob Gronkowski's season-ending back surgery and the loss of two defensive stalwarts, Chandler Jones and Jamie Collins. \nThe Falcons, making their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, are going for their first title led by league MVP Matt Ryan and wide receiver Julio Jones. \nCountry star Luke Bryan will do the national anthem and Lady Gaga will perform the halftime show. \nNew England will enter the game as a 3-point favourite.
