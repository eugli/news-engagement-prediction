In 2015, police targeted almost 250 rights lawyers and activists in what some have dubbed a “war on law” , and the effects of that campaign continued to be felt throughout last year. \nReports of torture while in detention in 2016 were rampant, with methods including beatings, attacks by fellow inmates on the orders of prison guards, stress positions, deprivation of food, water and sleep, inhumane conditions and deprivation of medical treatment. \nIn some cases, human rights activists were prevented from receiving medical care even once they were released.\nHuang Yan, who was detained in November 2015, was suffering from ovarian cancer and diabetes. Police confiscated her diabetes medication, and despite an exam done at a detention facility in April 2016 showing the cancer had spread, she was not treated and was denied medical bail.\nWhen she was finally released, Huang was scheduled to undergo surgery last November to treat her cancer, but the authorities pressured the hospital and the team of surgeons declined to treat her.\nTorture also took more overt forms. Last year reports also emerged that rights lawyer Xie Yang was subject to beatings and stress positions in detention , with interrogators warning him: “We’ll torture you to death just like an ant”.\nIn November 2016, Jiang Tianyong, a respected Christian attorney, disappeared while about to board a train and police waited weeks to confirm he had been detained. Jiang’s whereabouts are still a mystery nearly three months later.\nIn a rare strongly-worded statement , the European Union called for his immediate release along with several other lawyers. \nChina also continued the practice of airing confessions on state television, a move that is reminiscent of internal Communist party political purges.\nA human rights activist, a secret prison and a tale from Xi Jinping's new China Read more \nIn one of the most prominent cases, Swedish NGO worker Peter Dahlin was paraded on the national broadcaster after three weeks in detention , declaring: “I have violated Chinese law through my activities here. I have caused harm to the Chinese government. I have hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.”\nThe confessions air before detainees ever see the inside of a courtroom, and in Dahlin’s case he was promptly deported. \nFor those activists that do go to trial, in at least 15 cases last year police attempted to pressure activists into accepting government-appointed lawyers. In cases where state-appointed lawyers represented human rights activists, little defence was mounted and the accused pleaded guilty and promised not to appeal their cases. \nThe report also outlined two laws passed in 2016 that are likely to curb civil society: legislation regulating charitable giving and a law on foreign NGOs. The charity law, while not explicitly requiring all NGOs to register with the government, makes it difficult for unregistered organisations to raise funds domestically.\nThe foreign NGO regulations require overseas groups that give money to Chinese organisations to be registered with the police.\n“Together, these laws will hamper the development of Chinese civil society by restricting their funding,” the CHRD report said. \n“There are no more ‘grey areas’,” an unnamed human rights activist said in the report. “To advocate for human rights in China today, you must be willing to accept the reality that the government views your work as ‘illegal’.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:14:19.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
