BRENT MCFADDEN \nThe bridge of the Mikhail Lermontov. \nThe top three levels of the 155-metre long ship, the jewel in the crown of the Soviet cruise fleet, had been sliced off by the movement and force of the water. \nREAD MORE: \n\"The bridge deck, the sun deck and the compass deck parted company with the boat deck,\" McFadden said.

Ad Feedback \nEver since the original exclusion zone around the wreck was cleared, divers had been taking trinkets from the ship: crockery, bottles from the bars, and other mementoes. \n\"There were a lot of people that went through all the bedrooms and took things - it was a bit of a treasure hunt in the first year or two,\" McFadden said. SUPPLIED \nThe Mikhail Lermontov listing after hitting rocks off Cape Jackson, in the Marlborough Sounds. \nThe Picton dive store owner stressed that anything he took from the site went into a kind of museum, based out of a dive lodge leased by the company in the Sounds. \nHowever, he said he once tried some Guiness he found in a bottle in one of the bars, and even after 30 years under the water it was OK to drink. \nDiving through the sunken liner, named after the celebrated Russian poet Mikhail Lermontov, shot dead in a duel in 1841, could be an eerie experience, McFadden said. BRENT MCFADDEN \nA commemorative plaque made for the 30th anniversary of the sinking of the Mikhail Lermontov, on February 16, 1986. \nTables and chairs bolted to the floor had become part of the walls divers passed along, with everything transformed into a kind of twilight zone green because of the algae. \nLast January, McFadden and a dive group were exploring the wreck when an earthquake hit, throwing up silt and reducing visibility to almost zero. \n\"An earthquake on land is bad enough but under the water .... One of the guys was in the [Lermontov's] hospital and he said the walls were billowing in and out,\" he said.

ALEXANDER TURNBULL LIBRARY \nThe Soviet cruise liner Mikhail Lermontov berthed in Wellington Harbour, the day before it hit rocks off Cape Jackson, in the Marlborough Sounds. \nOne person was killed. \nJamison attempted to navigate the ship through a narrow, shallow passage between the cape and an offshore lighthouse, when it struck rocks, tearing a long gash in its port side. \nThe harbourmaster has never spoken publicly about his decision to take the ship through the passage, and there was criticism at the time that no formal inquiry was held. \nLast year, the 30th anniversary of the sinking, McFadden and others attached a plaque to the bridge of the Lermontov, with the line '30 years amazing diving. Thank you Cpt. Don Jamison, pilot'. \n\"As far as wrecks are concerned, it's the most accessible cruise ship in the world, because it's within recreational depths,\" McFadden said. \n\"It's become its own ecosystem, the variety of fish in it is greater than any other dive site in Marlborough.\" - The Marlborough Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:09:32.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
