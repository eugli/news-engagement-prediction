Sir Ivan Rogers' resignation letter to staff in full \nIn December he attracted criticism from some MPs when his warning to ministers that the European consensus was that a deal might not be done until the early to mid-2020s was revealed by the BBC. \nGiving evidence to the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, he said this had come from a briefing he had written for Prime Minister Theresa May in October, based on the views of key figures in the EU and the remaining member states. \nHe said he did not know how it became public. \nThe government says it can conclude all separation negotiations, including a new free trade deal, within two years, having given notice of the UK's departure from the EU by the end of March. \nAsked about the anticipated timescale, Sir Ivan said a comprehensive free trade agreement such as the one Mrs May was seeking would be the most comprehensive ever negotiated by the EU, and previous agreements have taken \"an awful lot of time\". \nHe said he believed an agreement with the UK could be concluded more quickly, but said the Brexit negotiation would be \"unprecedentedly large\" covering \"huge tracts of Whitehall\". \n\"It's a negotiation on the scale that we haven't experienced ever, certainly not since the Second World War.\" \nSir Ivan told MPs the 27 remaining EU states would spend \"an awful lot of time debating with each other\" before negotiating with the UK, agreeing a common position. \nAsked how confidential the negotiations would be, he said: \"I think an awful lot will leak, Brussels is very leaky...stuff will get out, and incessantly in my view.\" \nHe added: \"Expect an awful lot of this negotiation to be conducted very publicly.\" \nSir Ivan has been replaced by Sir Tim Barrow, a former UK ambassador to Russia.
