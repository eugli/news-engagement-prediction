Some Skokie residents are pushing for that village to establish a sanctuary policy. (Patrick Gorski / Pioneer Press) Mike Isaacs residents who said they are part of a newly-formed group called Skokie Citizens for Action are urging village leaders to pursue making Skokie a sanctuary municipality.\nDuring citizen comments at Monday's Skokie Village Board meeting, several residents said the village needs to take this step — even while acknowledging Skokie has been a welcoming town to ethnically diverse residents. \nSkokie resident Jessica Beverly said it was at a recent unity march held in Morton Grove where groups were encouraged to work to try to expand the sanctuary village movement. While the Skokie Village Board was meeting Monday, she noted, the Oak Park Village Board was voting on sanctuary status for its village. \n\"It is up to us as citizens of this great nation and wonderful village to stand for something more than caring about diversity and to make ourselves heard and understood to be a sanctuary village,\" Beverly said. \nSanctuary cities and villages commonly refer to municipalities that provide protection for undocumented immigrants. \nThe subject of sanctuary status for towns moved front and center recently after President Donald Trump signed an executive order restricting or banning immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries — a policy now being legally challenged. Trump has also threatened to withhold federal funding to sanctuary municipalities. \nSkokie Mayor George Van Dusen said the village has had a long-standing hands-off policy regarding residents' immigration status even if it has not adopted sanctuary status legislation. (Mike Isaacs) \n\"The village's policy is and always has been, and it will continue to be, that we do not ask anyone their immigration status,\" Van Dusen said. \"We do not keep immigration records and we are not the immigration police.\" \nWhenever anyone asks for police, fire or human services of any kind, he said, they are not asked about their immigration status — a policy the mayor said will not change. \nBut Van Dusen also said that Skokie relies on federal funding of about $1.5 million annually. \n\"This isn't change,\" he said. \"This is real money and it effects people.\" \nAccording to Van Dusen, some of that money goes toward community block grant funding, which is distributed to projects and social service agencies that help low- and moderate-income residents. Federal funding has also paid for vaccinations, emergency preparedness and even for the hiring of firefighters, he said. \n\"What we're trying to do is strike a balance,\" the mayor said. \nAlthough only a few members of Skokie Citizens for Action spoke Monday, many came to support the group's position. \nCaroline Paulison Andrew said she formed the group after the Jan. 21 Women's March in Chicago . According to the group's Facebook page, there are currently about 150 members. \n\"Skokie Citizens for Action consists of area women and men who are dedicated to fighting to preserve — on local, state and federal levels — the civil and human rights of all U.S. citizens and residents,\" according to the group's social media page. \nSome members Monday asked the village to stand with other cities and villages that have declared themselves sanctuaries. Chicago, Evanston and, as of Monday, Oak Park are among sanctuary municipalities. \nUnder Oak Park's ordinance, no village agency or employee is permitted to accept requests by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or other agencies to support or assist in any capacity with immigration enforcement operations. Should an employee receive a request to support or assist in an immigration enforcement operation, the employee shall report the request to a supervisor, who will deny the request, the ordinance states. \nUnless the village is presented with a valid and properly issued criminal warrant, the village is not allowed to transfer any person into ICE custody, according to the ordinance. \n\"Everyone in our village needs information to make an educated choice because...it's serious,\" said Skokie resident Janice Sackett about whether the village should adopt a similar law. \"We know the background of Skokie. I've lived here for many, many, many years. But there's also the issue of put your money where your mouth is.\" \nThe mayor acknowledged that the threat to take federal funding away from sanctuary cities is not a certainty. \n\"Should the village of Skokie be taking a stand that we should be able to do these things and not risk getting funding?\" Sackett asked. \"Maybe we need to put ourselves out there with other cities like Chicago, like Evanston...and other cities who will all be in the same boat as we are.\" \nVan Dusen and other village officials Monday also emphasized what they considered Skokie's continued reputation for being welcoming to residents of diverse backgrounds. \nThe village hosts the Festival of Cultures and Coming Together in Skokie, the mayor said, and a Niles Township Interfaith Dinner on Thanksgiving Eve draws hundreds of people of different faiths every year. \nHe called the events more than just gatherings. The mayor said they demonstrate support for all of Skokie's residents. \nIn the wake of concerns over controversial national immigration policy, some local community leaders formed a new group, Skokie Cares, the mayor said. The group is supporting a campaign it calls \"Skokie Welcomes Everyone.\" \n\"We are a group of community members who are working on a campaign to welcome and support everyone who lives in Skokie,\" according to the organizations' website. The campaign asks people to display \"Skokie welcomes everyone\" signs in their windows and promises more activities in the future. \nSkokie Village Manager John Lockerby, a member of Skokie Cares, said the group has met only once but will hold another public meeting this month at the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center. \nVan Dusen said this kind of campaign and other initiatives speak loudest about Skokie's celebration of diversity. \n\"Sanctuary cities is a legality,\" the mayor said. \"It's a political statement, and I think what counts as much, if not more than that, is 'what is your conduct? How do you comport yourselves all the time?'\" \nBeverly said she appreciates Skokie's celebration of inclusion and the importance the village places on federal funding, but her group still wants Skokie to take action with \"more teeth.\" \n\"This is a trying time in our nation and Skokie needs to stand up.\" she said. \"We've always stood up for what we believe in this community. We need to have more than just a policy about it.\" \n@SKReview_Mike", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:26:04.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
