The Reason? His Daughter. By VALERIYA SAFRONOVA Continue reading the main story Photo Joseph R. Biden Jr. with his daughter, Ashley Biden, during a fashion event in New York unveiling Ms. Biden’s hoodies collection. Credit Danny Ghitis for The New York Times Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. revealed on Tuesday that for his next act, he would be leading a new initiative at the University of Pennsylvania called the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. But before digging into his new job, Mr. Biden headed to a fashion party, where he turned out be the star guest. The occasion: the unveiling of a collection of hoodies designed by his daughter, Ashley Biden, the executive director of the Delaware Center for Justice , together with the e-tailer Gilt. Proceeds from sales of the organic cotton, made-in-America hoodies ( sold on Gilt.com for $79 to $99) will go to Livelihood , an organization Ms. Biden started along with the line to aid economic development in Wilmington, Del., and Anacostia, a neighborhood in Washington. “Social justice doesn’t come from national movements or Washington politics; it comes from people making changes in their communities, in their day-to-day lives,” Mr. Biden said in an email. “It comes from people demanding change and creating change, every single day.” Or wearing it, anyway. Despite not being a typical fashionista, Mr. Biden nonetheless drew a huge crowd during the event at Spring Place in TriBeCa, putting his Secret Service detail — another unusual presence at New York Fashion Week — on edge. He remained for a full hour and a half, posing with a seemingly endless line of fans, including preening models and a few photographers who briefly swapped their professional cameras for selfie-friendly iPhones.

Credit Danny Ghitis for The New York Times Mr. Biden, it turns out, understands the impact clothes can have on society. “You get dressed every day,” he said. “If you’re using that opportunity to support your community and your neighbors, you’re helping give people a fair shot to do something extraordinary with their lives.” His influence is what led Ms. Biden to a career in social work. “It started with my love of animals,” she said. “My dad used to come home every night and I used to sit by the sink and talk to him about how we have to save these dolphins that were getting caught in tuna nets. He linked me up with then-Congresswoman Barbara Boxer, who I referred to as the dolphin lady, and she had me go onto the Congress floor and talk to Republican senators.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act was passed, and Ms. Biden had her first taste of public service. Now, however, she has teamed up with some other influencers, including the designers Christian Siriano and Mara Hoffman and the socialite Olivia Palermo, who mingled at the party with assorted models, snacked on foie gras puffs and perused a rack of soft, cozy hoodies in black, navy, forest green, blush, cream and slate. “Obviously it’s different from what I do, but they look cool,” Mr. Siriano said. “Me and my husband wouldn’t be married without Joe. It’s nice to kick off fashion week with something that feels good.” Though Mr. Biden was visibly glad to be supporting his daughter’s collection, he was clearly somewhat amused at the situation. “I know I’m being used,” he said, referring to Ms. Biden, “but I don’t mind.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:11:30.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
