First, the award show only announced Lady Gaga’s name when introducing the act. Then, the metal band’s frontman, James Hetfeld, didn’t have a working mic. \nThe rocky start frustrated Hetfeld enough to cause him to kick gear around until he decided to join Gaga on her working equipment. — Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 13, 2017 \nGaGa apparently got a full-back tattoo as a tribute to the band before the show, but it’s pretty unclear whether it’s even real .
