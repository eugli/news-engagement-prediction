This is grossly inadequate to address the emergency humanitarian crisis we are faced with. \n“Except a few Individuals particularly Gen. T. Y Danjuma ,retd, and Aliko Dangote, some organizations and NGOs, Nigerians are just watching us going through this horrific experience in our life time.’’ \n“About 14.8 million people are affected by the crisis. The estimated cost of destructions is put at over $9 billion. Up to 7.0 million people in the North East are in need of humanitarian assistance and 1.8 million people are Internally Displaced Persons (IDPS), out of which more than 80 percent are living in host communities and the rest in camps. \n“About 2.5 million Children are said to be malnourished, majority of them are in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States. Also, about 1.3 million children are without access to education. Over 65,000 children are orphaned due to the crisis.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:37:00.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
