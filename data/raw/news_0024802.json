A mudslide also was reported near Icehouse, and a tree was reported down in the Audrain-Echo Summit area. \nThe closure means that both major Sierra Nevada highways were closed Friday afternoon – prime travel time for snow enthusiasts from Sacramento and the Bay Area heading up for a weekend on the slopes. Yolo County urges motorists to avoid Old River Road due to saturated ground \n4:15 p.m.: Yolo County on Friday imposed temporary vehicle weight limits for for a stretch of Old River Road between the Sacramento Weir and Interstate 5 due to water saturated ground and increased erosion along the Sacramento River, according to a county news release. \nVehicles using the roadway must not exceed 5 tons. \nThe county also encouraged motorists to use alternate routes to avoid entering the shoulders to this portion of Old River Road and South River Road from the West Sacramento city limits to the Freeport Bridge. \n“The water-saturated ground conditions in this area make the road shoulders extremely soft,” Taro Echiburu, Yolo County community services director, said in a written statement. “In addition to being a hazardous situation, any vehicle, but especially heavy trucks, veering onto shoulders could result in levee erosion and road damage.” Avalanche warning issued for Crystal Bay subdivision \n3:50 p.m. : An avalanche alert was issued for the Crystal Bay subdivision, according the the North Lake Tahoe Fire Protection District. \nThe alert was for the area east of Tuscarora Road. Residents were notified via automated phone calls to avoid outdoor activity and to shelter in place until further notice. Public safety personnel were monitoring the situation, according to a fire district news release. \nThe Sierra Avalanche Center issued a “considerable” avalanche hazard warning for the backcountry, cautioning that “large human-triggered wind slab avalanches remain likely today due to gale-force winds and heavy snow.” Water rescue in El Dorado County \n3:35 p.m.: El Dorado Hills Fire Department crews and the California Highway Patrol are undertaking a water rescue near the Salmon Falls Bridge over the south fork of the American River, the fire department reports. Wilton-area residents advised to evacuate areas along Cosumnes River \n3:30 p.m. :The Sacramento County Office of Emergency Services is advising Wilton-ares residents evacuate low-lying areas along the Cosumnes River. \nThe Cosumnes River reached its peak height, over 15 feet, at Michigan Bar, which will result in the river reaching flood stage at Wilton Road on Friday afternoon, according to an OES news release. This will affect major roadway access in and out of Wilton. \nPleasant Grove High School, 9531 Bond Road, Elk Grove, has been identified as an evacuation center. \nResidents area advised to seek updates at www.SacOES.org as well as SacramentoOES on Facebook and Twitter. Information on roadway closures is available by calling Sacramento County 311. Workers continue work to clear mudslide \n3 p.m: Caltrans reported that emergency contractor crews were working to clear the mudslide on Interstate 80 at Baxter, noting that mud and debris was 8 feet deep in some areas, with downed trees. The affected area is about 250 feet long. \nThere is no estimated time of reopening and travel on the roadway likely will be affected through the weekend, according to a Caltrans news release. The eastbound lanes likely will open first with limited lanes available. \nAlthough the forecast is for clear weather Saturday and Sunday, Caltrans reported that rain was falling in the slide area Friday afternoon and affecting cleanup efforts. \nMotorists are advised to be prepared for significant delays and traffic congestion on the detour routes and on Interstate 80 after it reopens to traffic. Cosumnes River reaches flood stage at Wilton \n2:25 p.m.: The Cosumnes River has reached flood stage at Wilton, according to Sacramento County’s flood monitoring system.

The county closed vehicle access on Thursday. \n“It is for visitor safety,” said Kim Nava, Sacramento County spokeswoman. “With all the soaking rains, the ground gets saturated. There could be issues with trees and other debris.” \nThe ban on accessing the parkway includes not allowing bicycling on the multiuse trail, Nava said. \nThe Delta parks include Hogback Island access, the Elkhorn boat launching facility and Sherman Island in the Delta. \nThe Campus Commons Golf Course and its adjacent portion of the parkway bike trail were submerged Friday morning. The Effie Yeaw Nature Center located in Ancil Hoffman Park closed Thursday; it’s unclear whether it will be able to reopen for its usual weekend slate of activities. \nThough the region is expected to enjoy a sunny weekend with highs in the 60s, it may be a rare beautiful weekend in which the American River Parkway will be devoid of endurance athletes. Heavy runoff from the Sierra continues to force high releases from Folsom and Nimbus dams, flooding low sections of the Jedediah Smith Memorial Trail.
