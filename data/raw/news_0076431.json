By: PTI | Los Angeles | Updated: February 27, 2017 10:07 am Oscars 2017: Dev Patel, who was nominated in the best supporting actor category at the 89th Academy Awards for Lion, made the Oscar ceremony a family affair as he arrived here with mother Anita Patel. \nIndian-origin actor Dev Patel, who was nominated in the best supporting actor category at the 89th Academy Awards for “Lion”, made the Oscar ceremony a family affair as he arrived here with mother Anita Patel. Cladded in a white Tuxedo, the 26-year-old star was looking every bit a charming gentleman. Patel’s mother complimented him well in a black sari with minimal make-up. \nDirected by Garth Davis, the true-life inspired movie is based on Saroo Brierley, an Australian-Indian, who tries to find his lost family in India through the help of Google map. “It’s mind-blowing. It’s amazing I’m with my mother and this is very very beautiful and special moment. I’m still trying to absorb it,” Patel said on red carpet. \nWATCH | Oscars 2017: Indian Beauties Priyanka Chopra & Deepika Padukone Together At Pre-Oscars Party \nThe actor even thanked child star Sunny Pawar, who played young Saroo in the movie, saying “He’s a really beautiful little soul and I’m grateful to him.” \nSunny attended the Hollywood’s biggest gala night in a black tuxedo and completed his look with green and yellow sneakers. \nSee pics of Dev Patel, mother Anita Patel, and Lion child star Sunny Pawar: \nThe eight-year-old kid was accompanied by his father and was seen mingling around with a lot of A-list celebrities and even clicked pictures with best actor nominee Andrew Garfield.
