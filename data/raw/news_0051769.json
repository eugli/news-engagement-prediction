Wait for some time. We have not yet decided if an alliance is to be made or not. We will do so soon,\" Thackeray had said at a press conference. \n\"But I can assure that not only the Mayor, even the future Chief Minister will be from the Sena,\" he had said. \nToday, the Shiv Sena, in an editorial in party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, claimed that the BJP used the entire state machinery and all its might of Central leadership to secure unprecedented results in the BMC and other local body polls. \nMaharashtra Civic Poll Results 2017: As it happened on Thursday \n“The Sena has been ruling the BMC from the last 25 years. They (the BJP) used deceitful means to destabilise our rule. This has never happened before when the Congress ruled the state,” it charged. \n“The BJP used all that it had for the BMC polls. But, despite the BJP getting 82 seats, the Mayor will be from Shiv Sena only,” the Sena proclaimed. \nThe party added that it will walk on the path of fire and continue its fight without worrying about the outcome. \n“It is always easier for the party in power to win local body polls. Power helped the Congress and is now helping the BJP. We have decided to walk on the path of fire. We will not worry about the consequences,” it said. \nMUST READ BMC elections 2017: After hung verdict, BJP, Shiv Sena tie up likely, may share Mumbai mayoral post \n“Our fight (with the BJP) will continue. The war that had started was not only for power but for dharma, ideals and the integrity of Maharashtra,” the Sena said. \nThe elections to the cash-rich BMC and nine other civic bodies in the state, which had virtually turned into a battle of prestige for Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, heading the state’s first BJP-led government, and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, were held on February 21. \nAlthough the Uddhav Thackeray-led party emerged as the single largest bloc with 84 seats, it is way behind the halfway mark of 114 required to control the 227-member Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. \nAcross Maharashtra, the Bharatiya Janata Party made major gains by bagging eight of the other nine municipalities.
