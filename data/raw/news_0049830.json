There were 45 days when the water was so contaminated with fecal bacteria that young children and the elderly should not have gone in, although the province only informed beachgoers on 28 of those days.\nProvince didn't follow own rules for water quality at Parlee Beach\nMinister promises new Parlee Beach water-quality regime after public misinformed\nLeBlanc, the federal fisheries and oceans minister, was in Shediac on Monday to talk about a $1.9 million project to upgrade the town's sewage lines on Main Street.\nMayor Jacques LeBlanc believes the project to update the 50-year-old infrastructure is not related to problems of water quality at Parlee Beach, but the Shediac MLA, Victor Boudreau, sees a connection.\nShediac MLA Victor Boudreau says the upgrade to sewage lines is a first step in helping improve poor water quality at Parlee Beach. (Radio-Canada)\n''This is still indirectly a step in the right direction,\" Boudreau said. \"Because indirectly it is one of the main trunk lines that goes through Shediac.\"\nRole of sewage system under study Boudreau, who is also new Brunswick's health minister, said a government committee has started looking at whether any part of the town's sewage system is causing fecal bacteria to end up in Shediac Bay.\nAlthough he admits it won't have any answers by the next beach season, the committee recently outlined a work plan that includes submitting a report highlighting recommended actions to government by June 2018.\nGovernment departments will meet regularly to address Parlee Beach water quality\nDominic LeBlanc said if the town's sewage system turns out to be the problem, Ottawa is willing to lend a hand.\nParlee Beach's water quality was poor on 45 days during last summer's peak tourist season. (CBC)\n''The minute the province, and the sewerage commission — if that's the appropriate body ultimately to participate as well— come up with a specific plan to address any of these concerns that are found to be serious, the government of Canada will be happy to partner with and share the cost,\" said LeBlanc.\nLast update long ago Mayor LeBlanc said it had been more than 50 years since the town's sewage lines were updated.\nThe project, which is receiving half of its funding from the federal government, with the rest of the cost split between the province and the town, will begin in April.\nLeBlanc said the town recognizes the work will be an inconvenience for businesses and tourists, and it will stop in mid-June until after Labour day weekend.\n''We will not affect the core of the tourist season, it's vital to the downtown, it's vital to the economy of Shediac,'' the mayor said.\nThe town is hoping to have the project completed by the end of 2017, or spring 2018 at the latest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:37:46.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
