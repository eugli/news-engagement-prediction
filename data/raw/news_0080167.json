But nothing comes close to the social media storm caused by her look at last night’s Oscars. The actress paired her custom Atelier Versace gown with free-flowing natural curls that gave a fun vibe to her couture look. “I have always marched to the beat of my own drum, and I think this red carpet look encapsulates that,” Halle told Vogue . “The dress is glamorous with a sense of romance that made me feel feminine and fresh. With this look, I celebrate my natural hair by allowing it to be wild and free.” The actress wore a custom gown by Atelier Versace [Photo: One Vision] More Comments appeared all over Instagram and Twitter with people wondering if Halle’s hair really was her own. Others urged her to fire her stylist for allowing her to show off her natural locks. Halle Berry needs to march right back into hair and make up & remove that synthetic wig off her head. She makes too much money for that \n— Oloni (@Oloni) February 27, 2017 Halle’s newest look follows a ‘trend’ in the fashion industry of letting models of colour show off their natural hair; the 2016 Victoria’s Secret show being one such example. For too long, black models (and celebrities in general) have been subjected to hairstylists who have little knowledge of how to deal with their hair, instead forcing them to look the same as Caucasian models. So bravo to Halle for showing younger girls that natural is beautiful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:13:01.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
