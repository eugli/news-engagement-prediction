Her great regret: “Now I have to get it dry-cleaned,” she tells her brother, Michael ( Jeremy Shamos ). The older daughter, Holly (Kate Walsh of “Private Practice”), a homemaker and design hobbyist, goes to services only on High Holy Days. Michael, a professor of Jewish studies, doesn’t go at all. Photo From left, Jeremy Shamos, Kate Walsh and Maria Dizzia in Steven Levenson’s “If I Forget.” Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times If Michael is the least religious character, he is also the one most consumed by questions of Jewish identity. He has just finished writing an incendiary book arguing that the persistence of the Holocaust in the minds of American Jews has hollowed out Jewish life. Michael, who hurls his words like so many Molotov cocktails, insists that the Holocaust has made contemporary Judaism “a religion and a culture of, frankly, death and death worship,” and recommends forgetting it. (This point and others owe a debt to Norman G. Finkelstein’s 2000 book, “The Holocaust Industry.”) \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story These claims don’t sit well with Lou, a World War II veteran who helped liberate Dachau. In a late-night conversation with Michael, he describes, simply and feelingly, what he saw there and why he can’t and won’t forget. “For you, history is an abstraction,” he says. “But for us, the ones who survived this century, this long, long century, there are no abstractions anymore.” This speech, poignantly delivered by Mr. Bryggman, elicited spontaneous applause. But so did the earlier and wholly contradictory tirade loosed by Mr. Shamos. No one in Mr. Levenson’s play gets to make the definitive statement. Not even Mr. Levenson. Like other intellectually rigorous plays about to open — J. T. Rogers’s “Oslo,” Paula Vogel’s “Indecent ” and Lynn Nottage’s “Sweat” — “If I Forget” speaks to both the head and the heart. No condescending sense of playwright-knows-best here. The problems of what we should remember and what we should forget, who we should be and how we should love seem to confuse Mr. Levenson, too. (The current renewal of anti-Semitic rhetoric and the threats to Jewish spaces have only made the play’s quandaries ring louder.)
