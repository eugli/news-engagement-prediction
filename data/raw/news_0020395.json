They hit us on the counter. \n“It will be difficult now. Mathematically, nothing is done but we know that it is going to be very complicated. \n“We need to come back to the quality of our game, our passing, movement.” ALSO READ: 2016–17 Premier League Standings \nWenger started with defender Gabriel on the bench and opted for Hector Bellerin, despite insisting after the defeat to Watford last week that he had played Gabriel in that match as the Brazilian was better able to cope with the Hornets’ physicality. \nGabriel was a first-half substitute against Chelsea after Bellerin was KO’d by Marcos Alonso. \nWenger also opted to start with Theo Walcott and under-fire Mesut Ozil either side of Alexis Sanchez with in-form Danny Welbeck, impressive against Southampton last month, on the bench.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T09:43:10.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
