Ideally, you get him for a late second or early third-round pick. Then, if it doesn’t work out, you draft a QB in 2018.” \nMcCarron didn’t see the field during the 2016 season, but he did play in five games during the 2015 campaign when starting quarterback Andy Dalton was injured. In that five-game stretch, the Alabama product completed 63.5 percent of his passes for 1,044 yards. He threw seven touchdown passes and only three interceptions but struggled during the season finale against the Baltimore Ravens and in the Bengals’ playoff loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. \nWhether or not the Patriots will trade Garoppolo remains to be seen, but if he remains in New England it appears McCarron and Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo will headline the quarterback market. \nThumbnail photo via Aaron Doster/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:58:35.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
