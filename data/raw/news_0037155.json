Starting tomorrow, they will expand availability of their unlimited data offering to all customers. Previously, AT&T’s unlimited data plan was only available to those with DirecTV accounts, but come February 17, all AT&T postpaid customers can get in on the action. \nThe expansion goes live tomorrow and includes unlimited talk, text, and data. Customers looking for 4 lines can get into a package that costs $180. Assuming this unlimited plan is just like the previous plan, only without the DirecTV requirement, that would mean $100 for the first smartphone, followed by $40 per line thereafter. While that brings the bill to $220 for 4 lines, AT&T says that after 2 billing cycles, they will credit you back $40 each month, dropping the price to $180. \nTethering was not included in the previous plan and AT&T is not specifying here if it is or not now. We’ve reached out to AT&T for clarification on that. EDIT: AT&T confirms to us that tethering is not included in this plan. \nIn terms of throttling, AT&T sets a per line limit at around 22GB. Should a line hit that number, they could throttle you for the remainder of a billing cycle, should you attach to a congested network. Also, AT&T doesn’t throttle video, but customers can choose a “Stream Saver” feature that drops quality to conserve data. \nAnd that’s the newish AT&T unlimited plan, which really isn’t new, it just doesn’t require that you get a DirecTV subscription.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:13:48.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
