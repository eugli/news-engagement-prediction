Outside of the space where the presser is being held, a small group of protesters held signs and chanted, while inside, outlets like Reuters and Fox News set up camera crews to capture the action.\n\"Milo Yiannopoulos’s bold voice has sparked much-needed debate on important cultural topics confronting universities, the LGBTQ community, the press, and the tech industry,\" a statement from Breitbart said. \"Milo notified us this morning of his decision to resign as editor of Breitbart Tech and we accepted his resignation.”\nYiannopoulos, who joined Breitbart as technology editor in 2015, has come under fire for recent days after the emergence of a tape that shows him advocating for sexual relationships between \"younger boys and older men.\"\nYiannopoulos is a leading figure of the alt-right movement and a prominent supporter of Donald Trump. He has made a career out of offending liberals and has always weathered past controversies. But the emergence of his comments on pedophilia comments has prompted his conservative allies to turn on him, precipitating a rapid fall from grace.\nOn Monday, Yiannopoulos lost his book deal with Simon & Schuster and was disinvited from conservative conference CPAC , where he previously had a keynote speaking slot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:37:00.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
