Democrats were tough on Mulvaney, Mnuchin, and Pruitt during their confirmation hearings; Mulvaney was caught up in the politics of Trump's first weekend in office, when he was asked by Oregon Democrat Jeff Merkley to identify the larger crowd between pictures of President Obama's first inauguration and the new president's. \nPuzder's hearing has been pushed back multiple times. It's now set to take place before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Feb. 7. \nThe Senate was scheduled to take a procedural vote on Tillerson Monday evening.
