Fri, 24/02/2017 - 3:03pm \nDear Editors, \nBusybodies should be punished with demerit points and a hefty fine for causing congestion and traffic snarls, especially on the expressways. Advertisement \nThis morning, there was a fatal accident along PIE towards Tuas near Adam Road exit on the right lane where a car rammed into a motorcyclist and the motorcyclist died on the spot, guess what happened next? Everybody were there (including traffic from the opposite direction) are either driving at dead slow speed or stopping to see the commotion, I wonder what is so interesting to be nosey about? Is it very fun and interesting to see an accident taking place or when there is fatality? \nNow when these busybodies were confronted either by authorities or motorists on why they slow down or even stopped causing congestion, their trademark answer will be \" I am trying to see if there is anything I can do to help\" and some \"smart alecs\" used accidents as an excuse to excuse themselves from work or event for a day simply by telling their bosses that they are the witness(es) for that accident and the authorities is asking them to assist. \nSo now what is going on? Being a busybody is a trend now? \nBen \nA.S.S. Contributor  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T14:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:44:10.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
