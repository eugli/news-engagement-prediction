Because the committee is controlled by the Republican Party, it is likely that they will kill the resolution. \nThe resolution, which was introduced by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, would require Attorney General Jeff Sessions to provide “any document, record, memo, correspondence or other communication” pertaining to “criminal or counterintelligence investigations.” \nBy contrast, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told Maine Public Radio on Wednesday that the Senate Intelligence Committee is willing to subpoena Trump’s tax returns as part of the committee’s investigation into Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election. Those tax returns could in theory reveal business ties between Trump and Russia, especially considering the numerous proven connections between Trump and his associates and Russia. \nIf Nadler’s resolution had been left unaddressed by a committee for 14 legislative days, Democrats could have called it to the House floor for a vote. \n\nMatthew Rozsa is a breaking news writer for Salon.
