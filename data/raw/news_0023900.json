Some people who are in tune with the WWE’s inner-workings believe this is what is going on with Roman Reigns as he continues on with his WWE career through the boos and jeers. They believe what you see is what you are meant to see with the constant booing of Reigns. \nWhile the trolling of Reigns is one of the biggest to ever come down the pike for the WWE, there is another act of trolling going on and some say it’s even more involved than what the WWE has done to Reigns. Fox News cites how the art of trolling , as perfected by the WWE, is mostly kept to the social media sites and it is done the majority of the time to “get a reaction.” \nWhat you see happening with Reigns is meant get a reaction. Today there’s another reaction coming from fans when it has to do with the trolling of Emma, or Emmalina. WWE’s Emma in her Emmalina vignettes is a bit different than what is seen from Reigns, but they are both done to keep the fans coming back and it is working. As you can see below on a few posts from social media, fans are talking about the broken promises of Emma’s return. They just cannot believe that she is coming back until they actually see her in the ring. I would legit laugh hard if she was #30 on Sunday night. #InstantHeat #Emmalina #WWE #RAW pic.twitter.com/K0s5p6R5qF \n— Wrestling-News.Net (@WN_Net) January 24, 2017 \nIt all started when Emma was cleared by her medical provider to go back into the ring after back surgery. She supposedly waited and waited for the WWE to bring her back, but with each new event, the promise of that seemed further and further away. The perils of Emma started to take shape after she tweeted the message below to her fans. 6 weeks ago I was cleared… Each week I wait, the more frustrated I get. I feel sorry for the person who's going to see it's all about me! \n— EMMA (@EmmaWWE) September 20, 2016 \nEmma, who is the first Australian woman to become a WWE superstar, sounds quite forlorn in this tweet that was posted on September 19. It was on October 3 when the WWE got out their big guns to present even more of the perils of Emma. The WWE started to release short vignettes about Emma that suggested she was embarking on some type of makeover. \n— RingsideCollectibles (@RingsideC) January 26, 2017 \nWhat A Culture suggests, “the longest makeover in recorded human history is almost complete,” when referring to what the WWE has Emma doing these days. The last time Emma was seen at a WWE event was back in May. It was a week after that when the news was released she suffered a back injury during a live event. So, it has been since May of 2016 that the WWE fans of Emma have been awaiting her return. Her return has been teased many times, as seen below in a tweet back from January. While it sounded like she’d be there, she wasn’t. Emmalina can't wait to reward your patience: Raw, Jan. 23, 2017 – https://t.co/wpqeM2oczn #WWE #TNA pic.twitter.com/9qabK4RSRk \n— Daily Wrestling News (@DailyWWENews) January 24, 2017 \nWhen it came to the vignettes, the first one and maybe even the second one captured the attention of WWE fans, but even too much of a good thing can get boring. This is especially true when these short clips would offer up debut dates for Emma, which would come and go without so much as a whisper of the diva. ➡ New Emmalina RP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:25:48.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
