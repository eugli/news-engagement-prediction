This allows us to prepare more digital orders while simultaneously improving the customer experience.\" \nTo further improve the ordering experience, Chipotle is also testing tablets in restaurants that will allow people to order and pay for their food without interacting with employees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:47:20.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
