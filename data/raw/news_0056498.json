Smith and Dion Waiters currently play the role of the NBA’s court jester, Lance Stephenson is trying to make his way back to the throne (or whatever the court jester sits on). I don’t know if it’s because he’s bounced around the league or because he barely plays anymore, but Lance has fallen off the radar and we are all worse for it. In his prime he was one of the most entertaining players in the Association, regardless of how many points he scored. \nSo hopefully this absolutely ridiculous highjacking is a sign that Lance is looking to come back into our lives. I don’t think Lance will ever come close to missing 9000 shots or losing 300 games, regardless of how hard he may try. And if he ends up being trusted to take the game winning shot 26 times, something has gone horribly wrong in the NBA. But nonetheless, myself and countless other NBA fans are happy to have fun Lance back.
