This is scary. Feb 17, 2017: Zlatan scores his 17th treble, 17th goal v St Etienne and his 17th goal/assist in 17 Old Trafford appearances üò≤ pic.twitter.com/cA4Nn2Lisu ‚Äî FOX SPORTS Football (@FOXFootballLive) February 16, 2017 \nAfter 15 minutes his low free kick somehow dribbled through the St Etienne defence and into the wall. \nHis second goal an hour later was a simple tap in, and then he won a penalty with a couple minutes to play. No prizes for guessing who was going to take the spot-kick. \nNo doubt, Ibrahimovic has silenced all of his critics twice over with his 23rd goal of the season, and 56th in European competition for his career. \n‚ÄúThere was a question mark over him playing in the Premier League,‚Äù said former Manchester United and Sydney FC striker Dwight Yorke after the match. Zlatan gifted by St Etienne 0:41 \n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs shown why he‚Äôs such a class act. He‚Äôs brought back personality into the football club. \n‚ÄúHe walks the walk. He‚Äôs doing that consistently and it‚Äôs turning out to be a more than impressive season for him.‚Äù \nBut Ibrahimovic played down the win afterwards. \n‚ÄúWe created good chances. It was important to get a good win at home. It was a good game but I think we can do better,‚Äù Ibrahimovic told BT Sport. \n‚ÄúWe are winning but in a short time everything can change. It‚Äôs important to keep getting the wins we need. Everything can change but we‚Äôre happy at the moment.‚Äù 3 - Zlatan Ibrahimovic has scored his first Manchester United hat-trick.
