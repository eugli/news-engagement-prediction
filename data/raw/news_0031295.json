By Nicki Grihault, Telegraph Travel's Mauritius expert. \nAs most people tend to stay and party within the resorts, the main place on the island with life after dark is Grand Baie. Nightlife on the island is getting more hip at hotels, and there are some great bars and clubs if you know where to find them. Our recommendations take in a few key hotspots island wide, from cool beach parties with international DJs spinning the decks to dancing, live music and jam sessions, and top sports bars to spots for a sundowner. Banana Beach Club \nThe Banana has been “the place” on the island for a night out, beloved of both tourists and locals for over 20 years. The bar surrounds a towering flamboyant tree and is a good place to try a local Phoenix or Blue Marlin beer, or choose from a few international cocktails while listening to nightly live music. Upstairs, Zanzibar Nightclub, re-opened following refurbishment at the end of 2016, has DJs on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights. There’s a decently priced grill, if you want to make an evening of it.

It has an extensive pub-style menu, a ladies night with DJ and karaoke on Wednesdays and live music and dancing on Friday and Saturday nights (when the crowd tends to be older) in its tropical garden.

In a tiny traditional Creole house with wooden beams, it pairs gourmet wines by the glass or bottle (MUR200 corkage) – guided by a sommelier in the well-stocked wine shop - with delicious modern tapas, in elegant but eccentric surrounds. Farmhouse-style wooden tables lie under chandeliers made from upside-down wine bottles, and photographs of celebrities – from Mahatma Ghandi to David Beckham - with moustaches stuck on their faces, line the walls. A favourite main is Chamarel chicken, spiced with cloves and cinnamon, and there’s a small walled patio with comfy chairs and coffee tables, to sup outside.
