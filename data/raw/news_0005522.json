These are the very actions that he campaigned on.\nI support the president for delivering on his campaign pledge and taking decisive steps to put the safety and security of the American people first. For nearly two years, I have been pushing legislation that would do many of these same things, and I am glad we now have a president in the White House who has the courage to take action.\nAmericans spoke loud and clear last November and elected Donald Trump in an electoral landslide because he pledged to suspend these programs while his opponent was promising to increase them by up to 550 percent.\nAs elected officials, our sworn duty is to the safety and security of the American people. To put politics above one's duty is a dereliction of this oath of office, particularly when the lives of Americans are at stake.\nSubscribe today to get intelligence and analysis on defense and national security issues in your Inbox each weekday morning from veteran journalists Jamie McIntyre and Jacqueline Klimas.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

It is important to understand that this is not a Muslim ban. The executive order only pertains to seven failed states identified by President Obama less than eleven months ago.\nThe authority of President Trump to make these orders is well established in law. In fact, President Obama cut off travel for Iraq in 2011 for these same exact reasons. The United States is under no obligation to accept anyone into the U.S. from foreign countries.\nSince September 10, 2001, we have seen several thousand Americans murdered and hundreds more injured by terrorists who have exploited our visa and refugee programs. In spite of his own FBI director and DHS secretary telling him they could not properly vet these refugees, President Obama continued to double down on his plan of bringing in thousands of refugees from terrorist hotspots like Syria.\nSixteen years after the 9/11 attacks, many of the safeguards recommended by the 9/11 Commission have still not been implemented. The American people should applaud the fact that we have a president who has made one of these recommendations a priority.\nAs a compassionate nation, we can and should help refugees. In fact, we can help twelve refugees in safe zones near their home countries for the price of bringing just one refugee to the United States.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Poll: 49 percent support Trump's immigration ban, 41 percent oppose Nearly half of American adults \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" agree with President Trump's executive order.\nBy Anna Giaritelli • 01/31/17 4:47 PM It is shameful – but not surprising – that liberal politicians and the media are spreading misinformation about the president's actions. I believe the majority of Americans understand the president is working to keep them safe. Most Americans agree that we can longer afford to put political correctness ahead of security.\nThat's why I reintroduced my two bills the Criminal Alien Deportation Enforcement Act (H.R. 82) and the Refugee Resettlement National Security Act (H.R. 80). Both these bills would accomplish much the same things as the president's executive orders. I believe they will only strengthen his actions by codifying it in law and preventing future weakening.\nPresident Trump 's executive orders are a breath of fresh air for millions of Americans. His commitment to putting the American people first provides a glimmer of hope for those who have lost faith in their government. President Trump was elected on the exact same agenda he is carrying out – and his actions will ultimately save many American lives.\nBrian Babin represents Texas' 36th congressional district. \nIf you would like to write an op-ed for the Washington Examiner, please read our guidelines on submissions. \nAlso from the Washington Examiner Schumer defends 60-vote requirement for Trump's Supreme Court pick The New York Democrat said Senate Democrats don't regret changing Senate rules in 2013.\nBy Susan Crabtree • 01/31/17 4:35 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:05:38.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
