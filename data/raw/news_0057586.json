So perhaps it should be no surprise that La La Land is such a hot favourite going into this. \nAs always there is the usual chatter about who’s been snubbed this year and the lack of Amy Adams’ name in the Best Actress category for her performance in Arrival seems a little unjust. \nDenis Villeneuve’s sci-fi slowburner however is nominated for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography among others. \nSo whatever you think should win, here is everything you need to know on how to find out. Ryan Gosling When are the Oscars 2017? \nThe 89th annual Academy Awards take place Sunday, 26th February at the Dolby Theatre at the Hollywood and Highland Center in Los Angeles, Angeles. What time are the Oscars 2017? \nAll the red carpet action kicks off from midnight in the UK GMT (which is 7pm in New York and 4pm in LA.) The actual ceremony is slated to begin at 1.30am in the UK (which is 8.30pm in New York and 5.30pm in LA.) \nThe Oscar presentation also will be televised live in more than 225 countries and territories worldwide. Where can I watch the Oscars 2017 in the UK? \nYou can watch the Oscars on Sky Cinema special Sky Cinema’s Oscars channel - but be prepared for a late night! Now TV will also stream the ceremony.

Kimmel is the long-time host of popular late night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! in the US. It’s the first time he’s hosted the Academy Awards, although he’s got a wealth of experience having presented the Emmys, ESPY Awards and American Music Awards in the past. He’s also presented ABC’s post-Oscar shows in recent years. Is the Oscar trophy made from real gold? \nThe Oscar is 13 and a half inches high and weighs eight and a half pounds. It’s made from solid bronze and plated in 24-carat gold. The only exception to this was during World War II, when the gongs were made from painted plaster for three years. After the war, winners were able to swap the plaster statues for gold-plated ones. \nThe iconic statue was designed by Cedric Gibbons, who was the chief art director at MGM. It was then up to LA sculptor George Stanley to make the 3D reality. \nIt takes three months to make 50 statues.
