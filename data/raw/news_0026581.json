A committee headed by former RBI governor Bimal Jalan had recommended a review of the working of MIIs after five years. \n\n\"The five-year period is over. Sebi has come out with many circulars and we would see how those changes can be incorporated in the regulations itself,\" Sebi chairman U K Sinha said. He added that the regulator was committed to allowing options in the commodity derivatives segment. \n\nAmong the other steps, the regulator announced the setting up of a cyber security lab for the securities market and a facility for online registration of market intermediaries. \n\nWhile addressing the board during the customary post-Budget meeting, FM Jaitley said the regulator was evolving in accordance with the needs of the economy and markets. \n\nThe regulator also updated the board on the actions taken with respect to alleged lapses involving the co-location facility of NSE . The board was also briefed about actions initiated against brokers in the National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) scam. \n\nThe notional value of participatory notes to the assets under custody (AUC) of foreign portfolio investments declined to 6.7% in December 2016 from a high of 55.7% in June 2007. \n\nThe special investigation team (SIT) on black money had recommended a slew of measures, including the need for Sebi to come up with stricter norms for participatory notes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T10:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:45:14.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
