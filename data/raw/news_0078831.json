They announced the plans last June, after years of pressure from animal rights advocates who considered the exhibit to be inhumane.

She came to Baltimore after the closure of an aquarium in Galveston, Texas. \nTogether with dolphins named Akai and Nali, she wowed crowds at the aquarium's mammal pavilion opening with flips and splashes in December 1990. \nShe gave birth to several calves while in captivity, two of which, Beau and Spirit, remain at the aquarium. \nAquarium officials said Nani began acting strangely Monday afternoon. Despite receiving immediate emergency care, she died within hours, they said. \nThey are investigating the cause of her death. \nFemale bottlenose dolphins can live to be 50 or older, according to NOAA Fisheries. A dolphin at a Florida aquarium was 61 when she died in 2014, while another of the marine mammals died at 51 at a California theme park in 2011.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T19:31:31.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
