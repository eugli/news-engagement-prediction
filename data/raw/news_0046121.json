Members of the British Parliament had promised to take measures to fight the sometimes-life-threatening infection after Faye's death, but now her father, Neil, is pleading for real action. https://www.facebook.com/NowThisNews/videos/996122... data-width=\"800\"?type=1\"> Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \"They said they would keep pushing for an awareness campaign, but we've heard nothing,\" he told the Daily Mail . \"It's not acceptable, and it's not fair because children are still dying.\" According to the U.K. National Health Service , more than 500 Brits contract meningitis B (an infection that causes inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord) every year, and one in 10 will die from the disease. The vaccine protects against 90 percent of the circulating strains, but NHS still doesn't cover it for older kids. Most Popular \"There is just this massive hole children are falling into,\" Neil told the Daily Mail. \"We feel like we were ushered out of the building and that was that. It's all been brushed under the carpet.\" Although some parents might have to pay out-of-pocket for the MenB vaccine, it's still important to immunize your child and protect them from serious infection, wherever you might live. Visit the CDC website or check in with your healthcare provider for more information on this potentially life-saving vaccine. Original, 2/19/2016: Jenny and Neil Burdett allowed their friend Charlene Reed to post the photos of their 2-year-old daughter , Faye, featured in the above video , after the toddler died of meningitis on Valentine's Day 2016. The Burdetts asked Reed and others to share the images of their daughter, who battled a meningitis infection for two weeks, in order to spread awareness about vaccination . The meningitis B vaccine is recommended for babies aged 2 months, followed by a second dose at 4 months and a booster at 12 months. In September 2015, the shot became available to children born after June 2015 through the U.K. National Health Service â€” but parents of children born earlier, like Faye, still have to pay out-of-pocket for the vaccine. \"No, it's not nice, but it's reality, and it's what this disease did to Faye, which made her sadly lose her life on Sunday,\" Reed wrote in her Facebook post, calling for followers to sign and share a petition that calls on the U.K. government to cover the vaccination of all children against meningitis B, not just newborns. https://www.facebook.com/CharChar82/posts/10156470... data-width=\"800\"\" data-width=\"350\"> Reed also included the parents' account of the tragedy: \nWe were given a 1 percent survival chance, but she proved them wrong and carried on fighting. After a few days she seemed to have turned a corner, but the sepsis started to affect her more and the decision of limb removal was made. The extent of removal was massive, full leg amputation and one arm and plastic surgery. She was getting tired, her little body consumed by meningitis and sepsis (blood poisoning). We had to make the decision, a massive operation and she may die or we let her go peacefully on her own accord. We decided the latter and then watched our little girl slip away. Reed's post now has more than 127,000 shares.
