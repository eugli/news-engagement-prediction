Apparently, Kim Kardashian is under the impression that she needs to lose another seven pounds. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star wants to get to a goal weight of 120 pounds, so she's willing to try anything at this point. Her latest weight loss strategy? Kim is now wearing plastic sweat suits in order to shed the weight quicker. Oh, Kim. \nKim posted a video to Snapchat of a black plastic bagâ€“esque suit during a workout. Her trainer Don told her she looks like Missy Elliot. A post shared by Kim Kardashian Snapchats (@kimksnapchats) on Feb 21, 2017 at 9:55am PST \nClearly, Don is amused. \nMore from CafeMom: Kim Kardashian's Very First Instagram Photos Are a Far Cry From Perfect \nBack in October, Kim revealed to fans that she'd lost about 70 pounds since giving birth to Saint. Why she thinks she needs to lose even more weight is beyond most, but Kim is nothing if not determined. \nApparently, Kim got the idea of the weight loss suit from her younger sister Khloe, who's a fan of using them as well. Late last year, Khloe said, \"I keep getting asked where I buy these sauna suits from -- I get them from any sporting goods store, and basically they insulate the heat so they make you sweat double-time.\" Kim, who's admitted to being seriously impressed with Khloe's \"on fire\" body, figured if it works for her sis, why not give it a try. \nFrom sauna suits to \"waist training corsets,\" it's no secret that the Kardashian girls are willing to try anything in the name of, well, vanity. But hey, it's hard to judge them when clearly whatever they're doing is working.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:15:02.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
