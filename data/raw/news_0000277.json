Conspiracy theorists predict 'doomsday' scenario On January 25, an asteroid the size of a killer whale flew by the Earth at about 17,000 miles per hour, coming 30% closer to the Earth than the Moon.\nEarlier that same month, an asteroid roughly the same size as the one that struck Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 sped past the Earth at about 10 miles per second.\nThis is the latest in a cluster of asteroids to have a close encounter with Earth (Photo: Getty) \"It raises a few eyebrows when we see a number of close approaching NEAs over such a short period of time,\" said Paul Cox, astronomer at Slooh, which operates a number of automated observatories.\nAt the moment of the asteroid's approach, Slooh will point its telescopes at BS32 in an attempt to capture the fast moving space rock as it flies between Earth and the Moon.\nA live stream of the event, together with commentary will be available to view here .\nRead More NASA says mysterious object hurtling towards Earth could be an asteroid or a comet More On The Moon Asteroids", "external_links": ["http://live.slooh.com/stadium/live/asteroid-2017-bs32-flies-by-earth", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=DailyMirror", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://watchers.news/2017/01/31/asteroid-2017-bs32-flyby-february-2-2017/", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech"], "published": "2017-02-02T12:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:39:55.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
