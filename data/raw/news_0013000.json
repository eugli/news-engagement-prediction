Instead, the man she was flying with did all the talking. The second red flag was the travelers' appearances.\n\"He was well dressed, that's what kind of got me because why is he well dressed and she is looking disheveled and out of sorts,\" Fedrick told 10 News in an interview.\nThe flight attendant's instincts told her something bad was happening on that airplane. Fedrick says she was able to tell the teenage girl to go to the bathroom, where she had left the girl a note. The teenager responded on the back of the note: \"I need help.\"\nFedrick worked with the pilot to alert the police, who arrested the man when the flight landed in San Francisco, according to NBC News .\nRELATED VIDEO: Uber driver busts child trafficking ring\nAn Uber driver who suspected child sex trafficking might be taking place in his vehicle tipped off police and help put three people behind bars.\nMedia: MediaOS Video RELATED STORIES Singapore Airlines flight attendant found dead in San Francisco hotel room Repairs uncover cocaine worth $434K in airplane's nose gear Uber driver stops child sex trafficking incident Fedrick is speaking about her experience to spread the word about a new training program.\nThe group Airline Ambassadors is hoping to train more flight attendants to be as vigilant as Shelia Fedrick was on that 2011 flight. The nonprofit is training flight crew to spot signs of human trafficking, like passengers who appear scared or drugged, have visible bruises, or aren't allowed to speak for themselves, NBC News reports.\nFedrick believes without proper training, these warning signs may often go unnoticed by airline staff. \"I've been a flight attendant for ten years and its like I am going all the way back to when I was in training and I was like I could have seen these young girls and young boys and didn't even know,\" she told 10 News.\nAccording to a report by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the department arrested nearly 2,000 people for human trafficking in 2016. In those cases, they say 400 victims were saved.", "external_links": ["http://www.wtsp.com/news/local/flight-attendants-training-to-spot-human-trafficking/398871979", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/14/63/12111065/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/56/65/73/12279542/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/02/42/06/663965/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-arrests-nearly-2000-human-traffickers-2016-identifies-over-400-victims-across-us", "http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/How-an-Uber-driver-stopped-child-sex-trafficking-10824722.php", "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/flight-attendants-train-spot-human-trafficking-n716181"], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:12:06.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
