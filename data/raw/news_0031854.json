A 2-year old boy and a 26-year old man were shot dead while they were driving along a street in Lawndale, Chicago on Tuesday afternoon. According to the Chicago Tribune , the boy who was identified as Lavontay White Jr. was sitting in the backseat while the man and his pregnant partner sat in the front. In the live video, they can be seen enjoying a casual ride and singing along to the radio. Things went south soon afterwards. In a split second, multiple gunshots can be heard and the pregnant woman made a run to safety. https://www.youtube.com/embed/kJT4PMACRZI</a>\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen> The video continues from the woman's smartphone as she ran towards a nearby house asking for help. The broadcast cuts to black but her cries for help are still audible. According to local police reports, both the man and the child were both shot in the head. They also said that, according to the woman, a car blocked their path and opened fire. The 20-year old woman and the baby she is carrying have been reported to be in fair condition in a hospital. Police are already conducting an investigation into the identity of the gunman. Crimes are becoming more visible on the broadcast platform. Earlier, four African-Americans were arrested after they posted a Facebook Live video of themselves attacking a special needs teenager. The platform has also been used by a 14-year old girl to film her suicide according to the Miami Herald . In Sweden, BBC reports a gang of rapists used the platform to broadcast their sexual assault of a woman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T18:54:48.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
