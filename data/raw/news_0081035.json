'Hit her' \nLast May, a hidden camera caught husband and wife carers Maurice and Deborah Campbell assaulting and abusing 86-year-old dementia patient Dora Melton in her Peterborough home. \nMrs Melton's daughter Elizabeth Budnik told the BBC about the moment she had watched footage of her mother being attacked. \nShe said: \"He hit her round the head with real force. \n\"He didn't even stop to think. \n\"He just lifted his hand up and hit her across the head as hard as he could.\" \nLast September, the Campbells both pleaded guilty in court to ill treatment and wilful neglect. \nMaurice Campbell was sentenced to 28 months in jail. \nHis wife was sentenced to 38 weeks in jail, suspended for two years. \nThe Campbells were employed to care for Mrs Melton by Sagecare, through a contract with Peterborough City Council. \nA Sagecare representative said it was \"appalled and shocked\" by the abuse but gratified justice had been done, adding it continued to provide care for Mrs Melton. \nPeterborough City Council said there had been a thorough investigation into the incident. Media caption Hidden camera caught carers Maurice and Deborah Campbell abusing 86-year-old Dora Melton. \nBut File on 4 discovered prosecutions were rare, with just 700 of the 23,428 alerts resulting in police involvement and only 15 prosecutions. \nGary Fitzgerald, from Action on Elder Abuse, said: \"The overwhelming majority of abuse is criminal in nature and never gets prosecuted. \n\"It gets social worked, but it doesn't get prosecuted. \n\"If there's an investigation, rarely will the police be involved. \n\"If the police are involved, they don't actually want to upset that old person, so they won't prosecute. \n\"So you might get a police caution if you're lucky, or there might be no prosecution at all.\" Rise in complaints \nThe vast majority of alerts were raised about elderly people, with more than 9,700 involving people aged over 80 like Dora Melton, and 164 about people who were aged over 100. \nCouncils were asked by File on 4 for the reasons behind the alleged abuse. \nThey included: more than 12,300 alerts concerning neglect 2,400 reports of psychological abuse more than 3,400 alleged incidents of physical abuse more than 400 claims of sexual abuse \nIt is not possible to find out whether all these reports were valid and fully investigated. \nBut the local government ombudsman, Michael King, said there was a growing problem over standards of home care. \nOmbudsman complaints about homecare rose by 25% last year to 372, and 65% of them were upheld. \nHe told the BBC: \"What we see is just the tip of the iceberg. \n\"We see a whole range of complaints: failure to look after people's personal care needs, helping them with eating, with their own hygiene, helping them with medication, all sorts of day-to-day tasks that people should be getting help with.\" \nA Department of Health official said: \"This government has introduced tougher inspections of care services, given councils access to up to £7.6bn of dedicated funding for social care and will continue to challenge local authorities that do not fulfil their duties under the Care Act.\" \nFile on 4: Neglect - The Story of UK Homecare is on BBC Radio 4, 28 February at 20:00 GMT - catch up on BBC iPlayer Radio . \nHave you got something you want investigating?
