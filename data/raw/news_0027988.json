Based off of the initial shipments, Samsung could sell as many as 55 million units this year.\nPerhaps Samsung is trying to make up for the unfortunate Note 7 recall that caused it to take back roughly 3 million phones and dash its hopes of widening the gap between it and everyone else. Or maybe Samsung's banking on the Galaxy S8's hype driving up presales, so it'll need to have more phones ready when the sales begin. (The GS8 is to launch March 29 , with mid-April availability).\nThe Samsung Galaxy S7 reportedly sold 48 million units, but that might not be enough for the S8...\nSarah Tew/CNET So just how many phones are we talking about? Well, the first batch of Galaxy S7 phones shipped with 12 million units, while the S8 is expected to ship with 16 million units. This breaks down to 10 million Galaxy S8 devices being ready to go at sale time, and 6 million for the larger Galaxy S8 Plus, according to The Bell.\nIt has also been recently reported that Apple is buying hundreds of millions of OLED Samsung displays for its upcoming iPhone 8 . Samsung may be preparing for the high demand in curved screens by producing its own Galaxy S8 displays earlier on.\nUntil the phone's details are made official, stay tuned to CNET for all things Galaxy S8 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:54:31.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
