It commenced in January, 2016 and the field data was collected by February, 2016. \n\nThe final report of the survey along with detailed analysis was presented to the Railway Board on June, 2016. \n\nBased on the recommendations and the way forward given in the report for improving cleanliness standards at major stations, the Railways had issued guidelines to all zones in July, 2016 to undertake focused actions in relevant areas for improvement. \n\nAs per the survey mechanism, there will be a sample size of about 50 passengers for premium trains and 30 passengers per journey for other trains. \n\nAt least four rakes for each train should be covered, said the official.
