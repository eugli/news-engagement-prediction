During probe, the police found the thieves were the delivery boys hired by the logistics firm. \n\nOn Monday, two delivery boys Ravikant and Hariom were arrested. The duo revealed that Karan, the elder brother of Hariom, had hatched the plan. \"Karan used to place orders for expensive goods from and choose cash-on-delivery option. He tied up with the delivery boys who handed them over to Karan. The delivery boys then returned the parcels to the company, saying that the address was incorrect. The delivery boys claimed they got 15% of the value of goods as commission,\" said ASI Anil Kumar. \n\nThe police picked up Karan in Gurugram on Tuesday, and another delivery boy Amrit in Delhi on Wednesday. \"They have replaced over 50 parcels and sold them on OLX ,\" DCP (crime) Sumit Kuhar said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:12:14.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
