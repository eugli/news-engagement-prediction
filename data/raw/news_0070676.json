I am ready to fight whoever is my next opponent, I am preparing for whoever is willing to fight.” \nVijender, who is training in Manchester under Lee Beard, had overwhelmed Tanzania’s Francis Cheka in his title defence in December. He is undefeated in the circuit and the April 1 bout will be his third pro fight in the country, the earlier two being held in Delhi. \nVijender has so far eight wins with seven of them being knockouts. \nNeerav Tomar, promoter, IOS Boxing Promotions, said, “Zulpikar refusing to fight Vijender that does not mean that the fight will not take place; it is likely to happen later in the year.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:20:36.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
