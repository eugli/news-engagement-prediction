A Tribe Called Quest can still kick it. On Wednesday night, Q-Tip and Jarobi White held a listening party at MoMA PS1 in Queens for the group's forthcoming album—their first in 18 years — We Got It from Here . . . Thank You 4 Your Service . Famous faces like Consequence and Busta Rhymes, both of whom are featured on the album, cruised through the busy crowd during the night, which ended with D.J. sets from Prince Paul and Questlove. Guests sipped on Courvoisier cocktails with names like Bonita Applebum and Electric Relaxation. Phife Dawg (born Malik Taylor), the group's late founding member who passed away in March , was represented by his mother, who spent the night getting long hugs from Busta and Tip. During a later Q&A, Tip and White spoke animatedly about Phife's influence, even reciting one of his verses from the new album: “Now am I ’posed to be dead/Or doing life in prison?/Just another dummy caught up in the system.” Tip continued, pointing out this particular verse: ”Should I be mentally weak versus being Malik?” “It paused right there,” he adds. “Because you know, Malik, it’s not just his name—it means ‘king.’” While making the album, Tip says he listened to songs like “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen and “Money Trees” by Kendrick Lamar, sifting through sounds to find a “common thread.” The trio, back when Phife was alive, would often work together, reviving “the spirit of, not necessarily competition, but one-upping each other . . . steel sharpens steel,” Tip says. Any worries about ageism or breaking their hiatus didn’t apply any more: “That shit flew out the window . . . we just locked in. We became fucking kids again.” \nConsequence and Busta Rhymes.

As it blasted through the speakers, We Got It from Here felt like beautifully familiar Tribe territory—smooth beats, fast bars, coupled with nods to the new world of rap and “gatekeepers” like Lamar. The album boasts an impressive array of collaborators, from Elton John to André 3000, who pops up for a laid-back guest verse. There's also one song that seems to allude to our current political climate, a world where Donald Trump has become the president-elect . The song's lyrics nod to Mexicans and Muslims, with one particular lyric about the media weaving false narratives about a man who doesn't deserve the attention. “Yo, funny thing is, we wrote a lot about Trump, about what’s going on, kind of foretelling this shit,” White tells Vanity Fair at the listening party. “Especially Phife . . . he had a crystal ball or some shit.” White has a steely reserve now that Phife's futuristic lyrics have come to life. “I knew it was gonna happen,” he says about the grim election results. This weekend, Tribe will perform for the first time ever on Saturday Night Live , making their debut alongside host Dave Chappelle, who will also be taking the S.N.L. stage for the first time in his lengthy career. Though it's easy to imagine they’ll address the nation’s tension on the famous stage, White plays coy. “You’ll find out when you watch S.N.L. ,” he says.
