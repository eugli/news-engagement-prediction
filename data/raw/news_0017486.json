Photo: All Sport \nIn an answer sure to create intense debate, Waugh, who led the team in 57 Tests from 1999 until his retirement in 2004, plumped for Gilchrist. \n\"I always believed it took 11 players to win a Test match and we, obviously, had superstars in our line-up but if we didn't have guys taking catches off those great bowlers or batsmen scoring runs, those great players wouldn't have been able to fulfil their potential as well,\" Waugh said. \n\"All three had a great impact not only on our side but on Test cricket as well. If I had to pick one player, who changed the game more than any other, then probably Adam Gilchrist. He redefined the 'keeper's role and now you have to be top-class batsman to be in the side as a 'keeper as well.\" \nSpeaking in a video on his Facebook page, Waugh said Gilchrist was the ultimate match-winner. The hard-hitting Gilchrist, batting at No.7, had the ability to provide a turbo-charged innings which built on a strong platform already in place, as was the case against England in Perth in 2006, or by counter-attacking in breathtaking fashion, as he did with a brutal 144 in the second innings of a tense Kandy Test against Sri Lanka in 2004.

He had everything you'd want as a captain plus he was a valuable team member. He had a lot of input, he was cool under pressure and he gave a lot of advice.\" \nWarne and McGrath would also have strong support for being the best player. Warne claimed 708 Test wickets and bowled Australia to many a victory. Arguably his greatest series was on the losing 2005 Ashes series under skipper Ricky Ponting when he took 40 wickets. \nMcGrath finished his grand career with 563 wickets and set the tone for many a series by publicly targeting the opposition's best batsman, typically a captain, and successfully bringing him down – as he did regularly when confronting Mike Atherton and Brian Lara. He and Waugh remain good friends. \nWarne is unlikely to be surprised by Waugh's call. The two are no longer friends, with the spin king describing Waugh last year as \"the most selfish cricketer I've played with\" while on an episode of reality TV show, I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here . \nWarne still holds a grudge after he was dropped under Waugh for the final Test in the West Indies in 1999 – a match Australia won. \n\"I don't like Steve Waugh for a lot of other reasons, but that was the reason,\" Warne said. \nWaugh has said the decision to axe Warne, who had recently returned from shoulder surgery, ended their friendship. However, he said in his book The Meaning Of Luck it had helped to shape his captaincy. \nWarne had raised eyebrows in 2008 when he nominated Waugh at No.26 in his book of the 50 best players he played with and against. He had fellow Australians Allan Border, Merv Hughes, Ian Healy, Mark Waugh, Ricky Ponting and McGrath among those ahead of a man who sits in 11th spot on Test cricket's leading run-scoring list (10,927 at 51.06) and was regarded as one of the most fearless cricketers this country has produced. \nGilchrist became Waugh's deputy in 2000 when Warne was stripped of the vice-captaincy following a scandal with a British nurse. Warne and Gilchrist were a fine tandem on the field but had a loveless relationship off it.
