Hundreds of Argentinian women demonstrated topless by the Obelisk of Buenos Aires after topless was prohibited at a seaside resort south of the capital. In the US, a Colorado judge blocked an ordinance that bans women from going topless and showing their nipples in public. AFP \nDENVER, United States — A Colorado judge has blocked a college town’s law against women going topless, saying the law is likely unconstitutional. \nU.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson said Tuesday that Fort Collins’ ordinance is based on gender discrimination and issued an injunction against its enforcement. \nFort Collins’ indecency code makes it a crime for women but not men to show their nipples.

Other cities in Colorado, including Denver, have no gender-specific indecency laws. \nThe plaintiffs’ lawyer, David Lane, said Tuesday that he wasn’t surprised the judge blocked Fort Collins’ law. \n“My clients take a position that any statute with the words ‘Women are prohibited from.’ is unconstitutional, and I agree with them. Apparently so does a federal judge,” Lane said in a statement Tuesday.
