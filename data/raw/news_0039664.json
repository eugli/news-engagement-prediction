After these shows, we’ll be going back to a very different place we left.” \nH er soft-spoken, shy-girl demeanor and idiosyncratic chatter can be disarming, but this Russo-American chanteuse has always had plenty of bite. The same could be said of her songs: beneath their twee baroque veneer lie weighty topics such as love, lust, dreams, femininity, the human condition, and even politics, often relayed with acerbic intelligence.

Since then, though, her versatility and the lyrical complexity of her music has shone through, helping her amass a loyal legion of fans, among them, Barack Obama , for whom she performed at the White House in 2010. \nI wonder what the outgoing President makes of Ballad of a Politician, a sharp vignette in which Spektor likens those who govern to prostitutes. Here, the song from 2012 took on greater relevance, as her beguiling vocals skipped merrily through the octaves with added zing. Before that, perched at her piano, her lipstick glistening, the 36-year-old opened her set with the bouncy 2006 number On the Radio, which was lent ballast by a well-oiled string quartet and some vigorous drumming. Much to cherish: Regina Spektor in concert at the Royal Festival Hall Credit: Marilyn Kingmill \nF rom here, the classically trained pianist sprinkled tracks from her recently released seventh album Remember Us to Life – such as wallflower ode Bleeding Heart and the Wes Anderson-inspired Grand Hotel – into a career-spanning set. When she wasn’t dazzling with virtuoso piano arpeggios and soaring vocal acrobatics, she was charm itself, giggling nervously in front of a rapt audience and effusively thanking them. \nThere was much to cherish: the surging You’ve Got Time (the theme from the Netflix series Orange is the New Black , for which she received a Grammy nomination), a dolorous cover of her hero Leonard Cohen ’s Chelsea Hotel No 2, and a heart-melting rendition of Us, her giddy, chamber-pop paean to a blossoming new romance. But the set’s peak came, predictably, via fan favourite Samson, a biblical, bittersweet ballad that homes in on your heart ruthlessly with a series of perfectly turned bons mots. \n“You are my sweetest downfall,” she sang, piercing plaintively through tumbling piano chords. Emerging from it unfazed was just about inconceivable. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T14:45:29.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
