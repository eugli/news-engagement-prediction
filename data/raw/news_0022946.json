Here the foetus can be seen stretching its legs \nT his world-first technology was developed by researchers and clinicians at iFind – a project granted an Innovative Engineering for Health Award of £10 million funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). \nTheir aim is to \"allow screening of foetal abnormalities in an automated and uniform fashion\". \nAccording to Dr David Lloyd, Clinical Fellow working on the iFIND project, only around half of all congenital abnormalities are picked up by 20-week ultrasound scans. \nThe iFIND project hopes to change this by developing new \"computer guided ultrasound technologies\" using state of the art techniques in ultrasound, MRI, robotics and computing to create \"a multi-probe system for automated ultrasound imaging\". \nThe video above was made possible because computer algorithms automatically \"copes\" or corrects small foetal movements made by the baby during the scan to create clear images.

The foetus fiddles with its umbilical cord \nD r David Lloyd, Clinical Research Fellow at King's College London and part of the iFIND project, said: \"Taking pictures of a 20 week fetus while they're still in the womb really isn't that easy. \n\"For one thing, they're very small. \n\"The fetal heart, for example, with all of its tiny chambers and valves, is only about 15mm long: less than the size of penny. \n\"Ultrasound technology - used in all routine antenatal scans in the UK - is actually fairly good at visualising these tiny structures. \n\"It uses very high frequency sound waves which are reflected back (\"echo\") from the structures inside the body to produce an image. \n\"In foetal ultrasound, the images produced can be excellent; but unfortunately that's not true for every patient. \n\"Importantly, it is also one of the few imaging techniques that is safe to use in pregnancy.\" \nThe team behind the new scan technology are from Kings College London, St Thomas' Hospital, Imperial College London, University of Firenze, the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and Philips Healthcare.
