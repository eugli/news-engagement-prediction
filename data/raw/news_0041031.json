Isn't that an amazing picture? It's been a lot of fun.\" \nHe's frequently commented on the magazine's leadership and staffing , and railed against it after it failed to make him its person of the year in 2015, an honor he received after his upset election win the following year. \n\"I was on their cover four, five weeks ago. They should have picked me for the ‘Person of the Year,’ but they didn’t. No, they should have,\" Trump told a crowd at an Arizona rally in 2015. \n\"I said I’m never going to get it because I’m not establishment. But every panel that I saw on television when Time was — because, you know, it’s sort of cool, even though the magazine’s going down the tubes. No, it’s a cool thing. Most magazines are going down, in all fairness to them. It’s great, isn’t it? To watch these guys go down the tubes? Isn’t it great? I love it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:27:16.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
