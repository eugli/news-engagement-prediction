Article continues below \nAlongside Match of the Day regulars, Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer in the makeshift television studio was ex-Gunner Martin Keown. \nOf course, Keown is actually one of the more experienced pundits around today and yet one comment he made at half-time left everyone completely bewildered. Article continues below Sutton star mugs off Arsenal's Rob Holding with lovely piece of skill \nFollowing a first half of few chances, the BBC panel decided to discuss some of the challenges Sutton put in on Arsenal's Premier League stars. \nThere were certainly a few tackles that would have received a far stricter punishment had it been a game in the English top flight. \nBut when analysing one particular crunching challenge from former Arsenal ace Craig Eastmond on Mohamed Elneny - as the video below shows - Keown said: \"Look at this, bang! 'You're the foreign player that's come over to take my place, and I'm going to let you know.'\" \nIt doesn't really make much sense, does it? \nNow, we don't think we are jumping to conclusions here but it is extremely unlikely Eastmond opted to aggressively win the ball because Elneny was foreign and had effectively taken his spot at Arsenal. \nElneny was actually brought off during the interval and replaced by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who himself avoided a headbutt attempt - albeit a pretty weak one - as he went past the Sutton captain Jamie Collins. \nSee Keown? They weren't just targeting foreign players. \nAs you can probably expect, there were plenty of people who spotted Keown's comment on Twitter.
