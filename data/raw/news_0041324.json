He was sentenced to 24 years in prison earlier this year. \nDrobinski also prosecuted numerous attempted murder cases and was one of the prosecutors in the ongoing case against three defendants, one of whom has pleaded guilty to murder, in the shooting death of 20-year-old Colin Nutter of Highland Park. \nDrobinski said that over time, his experience as a prosecutor showed him the importance of having both qualified prosecutors and defense attorneys in hearing and trial situations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:23:30.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
