It was scary,” he told 9NEWS. \n“It’s been tough, but I’m glad I’m alive.” \nMr Chan was taken to the Austin Hospital and received stitches in his forehead. \nHis alleged attackers are described as having a southern European appearance, with full dark beards. \nThey are both believed to be aged between 25 and 30 years old, police said. \nAnyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:38:13.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
