Korean envoy still ‘delusional,’ diplomatic ties being reviewed by razak ahmad and joseph kaos jr \nPUTRAJAYA: Despite having been kept informed on what is being done to investigate Kim Jong-nam’s murder, the North Korean ambassador continues to be “delusional” in his allegations against Malaysia, says Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Anifah Aman. \n“The ambassador has been informed of the process of the law, but he continues to be delusional and still makes accusations against our Government,” he said, referring to the envoy, Kang Chol. \nAnifah also issued a thinly-veiled warning to Pyongyang, saying that Malaysia’s foreign policy has always been based on friendly relations with countries. \nHowever, Malaysia expects its friendly approach to be reciprocated, he told a press conference at Wisma Putra here Friday. \n“The ambassador must understand and realise the intent and feelings of not only the Government but also the people of Malaysia. \n“As the ambassador to Malaysia, (he) should realise that he must enjoy the confidence of the Government of Malaysia,” Anifah said at a press briefing ahead of Saudi Arabia ruler King Salman Abdulaziz Al-Saud’s state visit to Malaysia this Sunday. \nEarlier in Raub, Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi reportedly said he has instructed the Foreign Ministry to present to the Cabinet an assessment of Malaysia’s diplomatic ties with North Korea. \nThis follows the recent “less-than-diplomatic” remarks by Kang, claiming that Malaysia was in cahoots with Pyongyang’s enemies in the murder of Jong-nam, the older half-brother of the country’s leader Kim Jong-un, on Feb 13. \n“We leave our diplomatic ties to the Foreign Ministry to carry out an assessment and present to the Cabinet to decide. \n“We hope they can be maintained ... but at the same time, respect the laws of our country and respect the professionalism of our experts,” the Deputy Prime Minister said, according to Bernama. \nDr Ahmad Zahid, who is also Home Minister, was speaking after a working visit to the Sungai Ruan Cure and Care Drug Addicts Rehabilitation Centre here Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:19:46.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
