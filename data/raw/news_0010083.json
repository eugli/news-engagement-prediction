We are getting landlords who are just saying, oh, I used to allow dogs, but not any more ... and it's hard enough as it is for people with pets. \n\"Even families with young children, they're great tenants but they do cause damage and if they're not very responsible for it anymore, I think a lot of people are saying, I'm looking twice now at families.\" \nThe odd investor had told King they were so nervous about damage, they were not thinking of letting their property at all. Ad Feedback \n\"It leads to some very perverse situations.\" \nâ€‹Building and Construction Minister Nick Smith has proposed to change the current law so a tenant would be liable for damage of up to four weeks' rent or, if it was more, the landlord's insurance excess. \nKing said that was good news, but it raised other issues, such as whether it was raise insurance premiums for contents cover. \nHe also suggested that the tribunal take the view that if a tenant did not show up to prove the damage wasn't intentional, the landlord should win by default. \nDi Harwood, manager of the Tenants Protection Association in Christchurch said she agreed with the landlord in this case that common sense had prevailed. \nThe tenant had breached her no-pets tenancy agreement. \n\"Ultimately the tenants have a responsibility to look under the Residential Tenancies Act to look after the property that they are renting, and that shows in this.\" \nHowever, it was unclear whether Minister Smith's proposal would mean tenants making initial reparation could still be chased by landlord's insurance companies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:15:26.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
