I've been doing them with my kids in the holidays so I may have inadvertently done one,\" Mr Watson confessed to The Huffington Post UK. \nWith his \"inadvertent\" move, Mr Watson follows in the footsteps of premier league footballers, Prince Harry and Hillary Clinton, who have all dabbed since the craze emerged.
