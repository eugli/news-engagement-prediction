My heartfelt condolences to your family. \n“I have got report from our Consulate in San Francisco. The report says Vamshi was killed by a drug addict on Friday evening at Milpitas. \n“The culprit has been arrested. Our Consulate is in touch with your family. We assure you of all help and assistance.” \nAccording to Vamsi’s family, the incident happened when he was returning home after completing his part-time shift at a local store in Milpitas. \nHis father Mohan Reddy Mamidala, a farmer from Vangapahad, told media that he had received a call from the US police on Sunday morning stating that his son was shot dead from a close range by an unknown miscreant. \nVamsi had completed his B Tech from Vathsalya Institute of Science and Technology at Bhongir in Yadadri district of the state in 2014 and left for the US to pursue his MS. After completing his MS degree recently, Vamsi started doing a part-time job at a departmental store in the US and had been looking for a permanent employment. \n“He was in regular touch with us. He called me on Friday and was worried about the dwindling job opportunities in the US following the restrictions imposed by the new government. I told him to come back to India, if he did not get any job there. But he has now gone forever,” a wailing Reddy said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:42.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
