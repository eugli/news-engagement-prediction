Coit Observatory.\nAdvertisement\n“The earth is going to pass in front of the moon. It’s called a penumbral lunar eclipse,” Sykes said. “The moon will darken, but not entirely like in a total eclipse.”\nThe best viewing time will be around 8 p.m., he said.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

But it will still miss us by about 7.4 million miles as it flies by at more than 51,000 miles per hour, according to NASA.\nAdvertisement\nUnfortunately for sky gazers, the Boston area can expect another 1-2 inches of snow starting around 8 p.m., according to the National Weather Service. This means that the sky will be cloudy, making the moon and comet hard to see.\nAs to the odds of a full moon, lunar eclipse and comet passing by on the same night, Sykes wouldn’t give exact numbers.\n“First of all, lunar eclipses only happen during full moons and comets spend most of their time traveling through the galaxy,” he said. “This one is on a four-year cycle so it’s pure coincidence that it’s happening at the same time.”\nAndrew Grant can be reached at andrew.grant@globe.com .", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F10%2Fcomet-lunar-eclipse-and-full-moon-all-share-sky-friday%2FhVLuuEbhCfDZ2fFmCjQTcP%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F10%2Fcomet-lunar-eclipse-and-full-moon-all-share-sky-friday%2FhVLuuEbhCfDZ2fFmCjQTcP%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tComet", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F10%2Fcomet-lunar-eclipse-and-full-moon-all-share-sky-friday%2FhVLuuEbhCfDZ2fFmCjQTcP%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Comet", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Comet", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F10%2Fcomet-lunar-eclipse-and-full-moon-all-share-sky-friday%2FhVLuuEbhCfDZ2fFmCjQTcP%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Comet"], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:41:36.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
