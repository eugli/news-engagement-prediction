Pics/Bipin Kokate \nVegetarian is the new swag, and paneer has finally broken up with the tikka. The trend was evident last year with the entry of Ranveer Brar's TAG GourmART Kitchen, and more recently, Pravas and TRE lounge. Now, Breach Candy joins the bandwagon with Candy And Green, a 100-seater eatery spread across 2,500 sq ft set to open on Monday with the promise to serve dishes 'free of meat, eggs and any nasties'.\nOwner Shraddha Bhansali has roped in Linesh Pillai of Terra Farms to transform her terrace into a farm. The result: 25 kgs of edible foliage per month. Consultant chef Karishma Sakhrani, runner-up in last year's MasterChef India, reaps the benefits into her menu.\n\nEuropean Bountiful Boards \nThe indoor section has leather-back chairs and decorative lamps. A bar serves cold-pressed juices and cocktails with equal flair. The focus is on both, clean, wholesome and indulgent food. The rooftop al-fresco seating opens into a wooden sun deck.\nThe fresh cold-pressed Papaya Orange Lime Smoothie (Rs 350) agrees with our palate. But we give the pungent Purple Cabbage Apple Ginger House Pressed Juice (Rs 300) a miss.\n\nMoroccan Lentil \nThe European Bountiful Board (Rs 600) has a cottage cheese log, hidden under creepers of edible flowers and microgreens, which we relish with an onion and chives dip. The Kale Crumble Tart (Rs 375) has the finish of an eggy quiche, achieved by a white sauce mixed with broccoli, kale and sundried tomatoes.\nWe wash it down with Vanilla and Hibiscus Bellini ( Rs 700), which has the tart taste of white bubbly and floral notes.\nThe dish that warms our hearts is the Moroccan Lentil Soup (Rs 275). Red lentils are spiced with lemon juice and red chillies, and chickpeas have been given a crunchy treatment in the air fryer.\nWe end the meal with two vegan desserts. No More Depresso Mousse (Rs 295) is light and airy, with a hint of bitter coffee paired with hazelnut. Whipped tofu replaces the egg and cream. The Coconut Pudding (Rs 295) is in the flamboyant company of passion fruit coulis and sliced strawberries.\nWe'll go back to savour the dishes we didn't try, the soup that warmed our tummies and the desserts that won the war against cheat days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:07:33.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
