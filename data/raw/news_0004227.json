In the meantime our man in Gabon, Collins Okinyo with the help of our Afcon editorial staff, have been compiling a list of sound bites, utterances , highlights and flops from the tournament which we now present with a slight sprinkling of African humour. We hope you enjoy the read and not be offended by any item on our list of hits and misses. \nMark Gleason : With his ability to pronounce our African names properly, be they Wolof or Berber, Bantu or Ashanti, as well as his astute knowledge of the game and mind-blowing facts, Gleason has again demonstrated why he is without a doubt Africa’s best play by play commentator. HIT \nSubstitution error : Ghana V Uganda - Andre Ayew substituting Andre Ayew. MISS \nBest substitution: Burkina V Morocco – Aristide Bance who took just four minutes to strike gold. HIT \nBest goal celebration: player Junior Kabananga HIT \nBest goal celebration: team (TIE) DRC’s ‘Lets gyrate and flog’ and Ghana’s ‘Driving the bus together’ dances HIT \nMost vocal fans: (TIE) Burkina Faso and DRC HIT \nBest quote: Coach ‘Micho’s law of relativity quote before Ghana V Uganda – ‘What goes up must eventually, come down’. HIT \nSaddest Moment: An inconsolable Mane being led off the pitch by his coach Cisse (below) , who will be linked forever by history, for both missing the crucial penalty against Cameroon 15 years apart. JUST SAD \nFans favourite snack: Nyembwe. A mouth-watering dish of chicken and spicy palm pulp. It’s so good that it is the national dish not just of Gabon, but of the two Congo’s as well. HIT \nFans favourite drink : Régab beer. Though not allowed in the stadia, it can be purchased within spitting distance even in the morning, and sometimes even cheaper than water. HIT \nMr. Forever Young: El Hadry HIT \nMost common mode of transportation: Taxi Brousse is the usual transport means for many fans while in Libreville they are called Matatus. Here the system puzzled many foreigners, because one has to shout your intended destination, the number of seats you need, and the price you are offering over all the din of traffic at the driver, who can either accept, or simply drive off without saying a word. MISS \nWorst miss: AAubameyang against Cameroon MISS \nBest goal : Bance's bomb against Morocco because of the consequence YOU TELL US! \nBest jersey: Mali (TIE) Mali’s Eagle across the chest and Senegal's roaring Lion kits HIT \nWorst jersey: (TIE) Zimbabwe – unbranded against Algeria and Ghana aimed at mimicking Germany but it was too busy, and they ended up playing like Bangladesh against Cameroon MISS \nTotal Cost for the games: $746m with $3.2m going just on the tournaments mascot Samba (below) YOU TELL US! \nTotal TV audience for the games: 650 million people BIG HIT \nWinner’s purse: $4m up from $1.5 at the last edition BIG HIT \nMost powerful rendition of a national anthem The Cranes. They waited for 39 years to sing it, and came through like canaries. HIT \nBiggest contributor: Total who paid $240m to sponsor Caf events through 2024 YOU TELL US! \nBiggest waste: $6m spent by the Ivory Coast to prepare for the tournament. MISS \nBig noise, least impact: Zaha MISS \nMost unusual request: $5,000 per game demanded by the Brave ( and greedy) Warriors per game…win or lose BIG FLOP \nHeart warming fact : Egypt the seven-time champion, get $850 per game and under $3000 if they win the cup and nobody grumbles. BIG HIT AND now PLEASE STAND A SING Nkosi sikelel' Afrika \nCheapest ticket: $0.80 Big Hit \nMost expensive ticket: $60.00 YOU TELL US! \nNeutral Crowds most favourite player: Aristide Bance Hit \nMost asked question (as of yesterday) : Will Egypt’s 19 match unbeaten run at Afcon that stretches over 13 years finally fall? \nPlease look out for our total recap of Afcon in numbers once the tournament concludes © supersport.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:51:30.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
