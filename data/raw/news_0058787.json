By karthika raveendran | Updated: February 23, 2017 8:33 pm comments \nShe has been in the industry for 15 years now, but even today she is one of the busiest actresses. This year is looking big as she has 7 films in her kitty. There’s a comedy horror, a love story, a light hearted entertainer, a real life based project, an action packed sequel and an edgy part 2 – there’s a little bit of everything for everyone. By now you would have guessed we are talking about Tamil actress – Trisha Krishnan . Apart from these projects, what’s interesting is, she’s teaming up with new actors this time for two -three of her films. They are combos that should have been tried years ago, but now that it’s happening we are looking forward to them. Last year she played a powerful grey character in Kodi and left us stunned with her performance, so much so she stole the limelight away from Dhanush. There’s lots more coming your way this year – Mohini, Hey Jude, Garjanai, 96, 1818, Saamy 2, Sathuranga Vettai 2. Let’s give you a detailed low down of each of these projects: \nMohini \nSo far, the makers have released only the first look, but when it was out, we realised it’s not your typical comedy horror. Trisha’s Nataraj avatar caught everybody’s attention for its minute detailing and striking pose. She reportedly plays a chef and a ghost in this film. She trained under expert chefs to understand better, the basics of cooking. The movie was extensively shot in London. The VFX team that worked with the Harry Potter series is part of this film as well. We sure can expect some amazing visuals, just like the first look.

This is the sequel to the 2014 movie – Sathuranga Vettai 2. While the first one was rural centric, this will be a slick urban centric heist. While certain elements will repeat itself, it will be a brand new story. The first looks have intrigued fans, courtesy the interesting pair. Both have aced grey character before, so we can expect a powerful repeat performance as a team. \nHey Jude \nThis film will mark a debut in Malayalam cinema opposite superstar Nivin Pauly. The film’s tagline reads – Be yourself. love will find out. The film is reportedly about discovery, healing, and transformation. Well, if you are making your debut with The Nivin Pauly in a fun, love story, fans are bound to be excited!

Trisha will play a pivotal role among other stars. She reportedly plays a receptionist of the hotel where the attack took place. The film will showcase a 12 hour hostage period from 6pm to 6am. It’s a bilingual release in Tamil and Telugu. \n96 \nThis is her first project with Vijay Sethupathi. No details of this movie have been divulged, all we kn0w is it will be a light hearted entertainer. To set the ball rolling, the makers released a first look with the movie title logo. The film is reportedly in pre-production stage and will go on floors in June. \nGarjanai: \nThis film is based on Anushka Shetty’s gitty film – NH10. Obviously Trisha is set to reprise her part. Like the Hindi film, this movie will also highlight the prevalence of Honor killings. \nSaamy 2 \nIt was yesterday, Trisha announced her 7th project this year, but her 62nd film in her career – Saamy 2. Yes she’s going back to right where she started. She will reunite with Chiyaan Vikram for this film. It’s going to be hard core and double the action in Part 2. Everyone is excited about the reunion – The Hari-Trisha-Vikram- Harris Jayaraj team. The film will reportedly roll out in June. \n— Trisha Krishnan (@trishtrashers) February 23, 2017 \nSo which film are you excited about? There are so many to choose from.
