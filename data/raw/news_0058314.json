He led the Tigers to five SEC West titles and one SEC Championship in 2004. Tuberville stepped down as head coach of Cincinnati in December following a dismal 4-8 season for the Bearcats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:41:01.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
