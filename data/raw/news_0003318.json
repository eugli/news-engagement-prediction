Michael Oxford \nPublished on Feb. 1, 2017 \nFeb. 1, 2017 \nAnthony Mundine's team has organised for world renowned neurosurgeon Charlie Teo to be ringside for his fight against Danny Green on Friday night at Adelaide Oval. \nMORE: Mundine's latest stand against national anthem \nTeo, who is known for his work on brain tumours deemed inoperable by other neurosurgeons, will fly from his Sydney base to Adelaide before the bout, after being contacted by Mundine's agent Khoder Nasser. \n\"I rang Charlie and I said I want the best neurosurgeon in the country at ringside,\" Nasser told the Daily Telegraph. \n\"And you know what he said … I’m not Australia’s best - I’m the world’s best. \n\"With a medico of his experience, I think Jeff Fenech has nothing to worry about.\" \nNasser was referring to comments made by boxing personality Fenech, who has said previously he believes the fight shouldn't go ahead because of his fears for Mundine's health.
