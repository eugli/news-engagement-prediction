Photo: Peter Braig \nA hearing by the full bench of the Federal Court got underway in Brisbane on Monday. \nBarrister Craig Leggatt SC said Adani withheld findings from the tribunal by its own expert that found the economic benefit of the large coal mine had been \"significantly over-estimated\" in a commissioned report. \nMr Leggatt said the expert also claimed the coal mine would only generate about 500 jobs, compared with the almost 4000 predicted in the report. \nHowever, he conceded the comparisons did not compare \"apples with apples\". Advertisement \nThe court heard the two documents had been tabled in the Land Court during Adani's other proceedings, but only the report that allegedly over-stated the mine's benefits were lodged with the tribunal. \nMr Leggatt said the tribunal directed Adani and the Queensland government to provide evidence about the economic benefit of the coal mine. \n\"The withholding of the material meant that there was a defect in the procedure,\" he said. \nThe bench questioned whether it was necessary for Adani and the Queensland government to table every document that related to the mine's economic benefit. \nMr Leggatt said Mr Burragubba, who is representing the Wangan and Jagalingou Family Council, wanted the tribunal to consider the matter again with the additional material. \nThe hearing has been set down for two days, with the Queensland government and Adani expected to start delivering its arguments on Monday afternoon. \nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:22:40.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
