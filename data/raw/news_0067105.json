It has played down the impact of the 42-day waiting time, arguing that its research carried out two years ago suggests arrears levels fall after three months once tenants get used to the new system. \nBut the former welfare minister Lord Freud admitted to MPs last month that at least a quarter of tenants on universal credit had run up rent arrears as a result, and he suggested that ministers should consider shortening waiting times for payment. \nThe MPs inquiry was announced on the same day that the universal credit full service was rolled out to a handful of new areas , including Poplar in east London and Warrington. The rollout is not due to be complete until September 2018. \nThe inquiry will examine the impact of the 42-day wait for payment – in some reported cases the wait has been up to 60 days when administrative delays are factored in – on tenants and landlords. It will also consider whether more support should be built into the system for low-income and vulnerable claimants. \nField said: “It is bad enough that UC has a built-in six-week wait between someone applying and receiving their first payment, but we have heard that many have to wait much longer than this. \n“The adverse impact on claimants, local authorities, landlords and charities is entirely disproportionate to the small numbers currently claiming UC, yet Lord Freud has told us he thinks it will take decades to optimise the system. \n“We have therefore felt compelled to investigate UC yet again. We will examine what its impact is on claimants and those local bodies which deal with them, and what government needs to do to ease the pressure on those worst affected.” \nThe wait for a first universal credit payment comprises an initial period of seven days, during which claimants cannot make a claim, followed by an assessment period of one month. \nThe 42-day wait is based on the idea that newly unemployed claimants will have a month’s final salary to tide them over, but many are accustomed to being paid weekly or fortnightly. Many have no savings. \nUniversal credit was introduced by the former work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, in 2013 to ensure claimants would be better off in work than on benefits. However, Treasury cuts to universal credit work allowances have reduced the incentive for some claimants to get a job and will leave 1.2 million working families worse off .
