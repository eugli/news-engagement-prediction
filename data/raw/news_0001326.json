Shortly after her selection, Entertainment Tonight, citing unnamed sources, claimed she would be prohibited from mentioning Trump during the performance , but in a statement at the time a representative for the league called that “nonsense.” The history of the halftime show has been largely without controversy, progressing from marching bands to upbeat groups like Up With People and then safe pop acts like New Kids on the Block. The league was forced to try to mix things up when in 1992 the sketch show In Living Color staged an alternative halftime show on Fox that drew more than 20 million viewers and an estimated 10 rating points away from the official performance by Gloria Estefan at the game. The show’s edgy football-themed comedy appealed to younger viewers more than Estefan’s performance, in which she was joined by the figure skaters Brian Boitano and Dorothy Hamill. By 1993, the league had learned its lesson, and had Michael Jackson perform, and in the years that followed they had a string of other top performers including U2, Paul McCartney and Prince. While recent years have seen the league try to go for younger, possibly more relevant performers, the controversies have been few and far between. When the Red Hot Chili Peppers admitted to not having played their instruments live it qualified as a notable event. The one exception to the rule, of course, came in the halftime performance for Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, where Justin Timberlake infamously tore away part of Janet Jackson’s top, thus creating a new meaning for the term “wardrobe malfunction”. It just so happens that the one controversial event happened at Reliant Stadium, which was renamed NRG Stadium in 2014 and will be the setting of Lady Gaga’s performance on Sunday. Gaga insisted there would be no repeat of Jackson’s wardrobe malfunction, saying that everything would be “nice and tight,” but said she wanted to preserve the mystery of her performance other than that. “There will be no meat dress there, so don’t wait for that,” Gaga said. “Get excited to see something that you haven’t seen before.” \nVictor Mather contributed reporting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T21:30:22.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
