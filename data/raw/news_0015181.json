She had become painfully thin over time - she existed on just five cornflakes and a small glass of water a day - but we didn't understand what was wrong. She was depressed, isolated and had uncharacteristic low moods.\nI will never forget the day we found out she had an eating disorder. We had taken her to see a paediatrician and he said: “If you don’t eat you will die – if you don’t drink you will die quicker”.\nOur hearts were broken as we watched on helplessly.\nWe often had no idea what to say. I would range between anger (\"can’t you see what you are doing to yourself?\"); pure frustration (\"for goodness’ sake just eat\"); and exhaustion (\"we’re sick to death of this – you are so selfish. What you’re doing is affecting everyone.\")\nMany parents whose children have eating disorders will find themselves repeating these unhelpful comments. Indeed, last week newsreader Mark Austin spoke about his struggle to cope with his 18-year-old daughter’s anorexia. \nA recent photo of Gemma Oaten with her parents \"What I failed utterly to grasp was that she was seriously mentally ill and could not see a future for herself,” he said.\n“I told her she was being ridiculous. I told her to get a grip and grow up, to ‘just bloody well eat, for Christ's sake’... I even remember saying, ‘If you really want to starve yourself to death, just get on with it.’ And at least once, exasperated and at a loss, I think I actually meant it.”\nL ike Mark, Dennis and became world experts in saying the wrong thing, sighing too loud and looking the wrong way. Family life was a war zone and the anorexia had a profound effect on the whole family. We didn’t always know to react and I know we made mistakes.\nToday, Gemma is a 32-year-old accomplished actress, who has starred in Emmerdale and Holby City . With the right support, we managed to help her recover from her anorexia.\nThe sadness that was always there in Gemma's eyes will be etched into my mind forever W hen writing this article, I asked her if she could remember any unhelpful comments we made, and she told me: “To be honest, the biggest one for me was when relatives would say: ‘You are destroying this family. Look what you're putting us all through. Mum and Dad are a mess.'\n\"I remember once someone said this to me when I was in hospital on a drip and I'll never forget it.\n“It killed me inside. Rather than encourage me it made me feel even more worthless. It's such a vicious circle, as all your family want is for you to wake up and get well, but all the anorexia wants you to do is disappear. Comments like the above only encourage the demons of an eating disorder.”\nWhen Gemma was first diagnosed, Dennis and I had to learn about eating disorders from scratch. We needed to understand that they are not about food at all but that, typically, there is an underlying issue causing the problem. \nWe learnt that our daughter was being bullied. This had undermined her confidence and she felt the only thing in her life that she could control was her food intake. She began to evaluate herself through her body weight and shape. That was when she began to waste away.\nAn old family photo H er personality changed as she became ill and the sadness that was always present in her eyes will be etched into my mind forever. It took her the best part of nine years to recover, but we’re so proud of how far she has come.\nHer illness also inspired us to set up our charity, SEED Eating Disorder Support Services , which provides support for carers of people with eating disorders. Dennis and I set it up after recognising the lack of literature available and huge gaps in services.\nToday, we hold workshops across the country and have helped hundreds of carers. It’s not easy being a parent whose child is being attacked by this devastating illness, but with the right support, they can get through it together as a family, and come out stronger - just like we have.\nMarg Oaten MBE is the secretary and co-founder of SEED Eating Disorder Support Services \nWhat not to say to someone with an eating disorder 'For goodness’ sake, just eat'\n'Can’t you see what you are doing to yourself'\n'We’re sick to death of this – you are so selfish.
