Psalm 19 was reworded to refer to “O Duchess, my butchness”.\nAt Tuesday’s service, much to the horror of many of the devout worshippers, they were invited to respond to the line: “O Gloria make speed to save us,” with the words “O Duchess make haste to help us.”\nThe Principal of Westcott House, Revd Canon Chris Chivers, told The Telegraph that the service had not been vetted beforehand; was not an authorised act of worship; and was “hugely regrettable”.\nCanon Chivers H e added: “The service that was produced was completely at variance with the doctrine and teaching of the Church of England.”\nCanon Chivers said that worshippers – who included staff and ordinands – had not been warned of the unorthodox content in advance and only discovered it when they picked up their orders of service.\n“People found themselves in a situation they hadn’t expected,” he said. He was forced the next day “to deliver an admonishment” in front of the whole of Westcott House.\nHe said: “Theological colleges are a place where experiments are important and mistakes can be made, because hopefully that means they won’t be made in public ministry. But it can’t be a place where we subvert the doctrine and teaching of the Church.\nWestcott House Credit: Alamy “We’ll be reviewing the process by which these things are authorised so it never happens again.” One former student at the college expressed his disgust.\n“This is horrific. As a former Westcott ordinand, I’m appalled,” said The Reverend Tom Lilley on Twitter. The Reverend Andrew Symes, executive secretary of the conservative group Anglican Mainstream, said that the service “brings the Church into disrepute”.\nH e demanded that Westcott House issue a public apology. But Canon Simon Butler, an openly gay member of the Archbishops’ Council, said that while the Polari service was ill advised it could prove a useful “source of learning”.\nHe suggested the choice of liturgy may have been “an inappropriate way of letting off some steam”.\nOrdinands, he added, “often do foolish things, but if it leads to a deeper engagement with things – I’m not saying it’s the right thing to do, [but theological college] is a relatively safe place to make foolish errors.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:08:26.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
