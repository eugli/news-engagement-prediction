I don't care if Costner didn't even attempt an English accent. I don't care that neither the spyglass nor the word \"twit\" had yet been invented during the Crusades (a fact that critics were harping about during the original release). Alan Rickman is the ultimate Sheriff, and Sean Connery makes an awesome Richard the Lionheart. Swordfights, archery contests, quarterstaff duels, a crazy witch, deranged indigenous Celts, and even some high explosives...what a movie! 'Nuff said. Welcome to Sherwood. by ml120 Despite some of the ill received feedback this film got in '91, I say it is a great hero movie. Costner is ok, but a great Alan Rickman makes a true villian (Die Hard). A better than usual surrounding cast providing some added comic relief from robin's merry men is a welcome. Great directing and a cinematic score by Mike Kamen still used to this day, make this a great action treat. The summer of 1991... by I LUV ï£¿ this movie hit the theaters. McDonald's had the Robin Hood Prince of Thieves toys that of course you had to go back to get every one. Bryan Adams had a number one hit song from the movie (Everything I do) I do it for you. MTV was running the music video every hour (when people actually watched MTV for the music) and my aunt's were totally in love with Kevin Costner. Probably the best version of Robin Hood on film and a star-studded cast. If you like this movie you should also check out Willow which came out in 1988.
