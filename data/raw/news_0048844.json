Designed with Connor's future in mind, the room is perfectly playful while cool enough to last well into his toddlerhood and beyond. \nFrom Courtney & Brent: When we found out we were having a boy we decided we wanted to design an outdoor themed nursery. However, we didn't want the room to feel too rustic or too \"campy\" so we decided to put a different spin on it and design a modern outdoor nursery with a neutral color palette and light wood. \nWe designed and built several of the features of the room ourselves. The large chalkboard wall with a mountain landscape that Brent drew in chalk really sets the tone of the room and packs a huge punch. Above the crib hangs a mobile we made with felt pieces and hid a baby camera in the wood slice. \nWe custom built our own changing table to match the style our crib. We designed it to have faux drawers on the actual doors that hide diaper changing supplies as well as a diaper pail because we didn't want our diaper pail out in the open. \nWe wanted to add a whimsical touch that our son could grow into, so we built him his very own reading nook tent. On the shelf in the tent we added a few playful decor pieces. Next to the reading nook tent are bookshelves to display books so they are easy to grab. \nWe couldn't afford the rocking chair that we liked so instead we purchased a chair and replaced the legs with a rocking chair base that we built. We also made the log side table from a stump that we got for free. \nWhen it came to adding color to the room we wanted to incorporate contrasting teal and orange colors and did this through artwork, pillows, and stuff animals featuring foxes. \nOur biggest challenge in the room was that it did not have a closet. We didn't have space for a big dresser, so to utilize the empty wall space we designed and built a vertical clothes rack with dowel rods and baskets to store the baby's clothes. \nWe are pleased with how all the elements came together to create a fun space that can grow with our son. \nSource List: Paint Color: Dovetail from Sherwin Williams Crib: Babyletto Arrow", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:02:44.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
