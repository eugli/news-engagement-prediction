(Carolyn Kaster/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   9:00 PM \nThe Donald returned to primetime television Tuesday — just in time for February sweeps — and bearing a rose, er, gavel for his new Supreme Court pick. \nAnd it was 10th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Neil Gorsuch, 49, who survived the “Apprentice” and “Bachelor”-style elimination round to earn President Trump's undying love: a nomination to join the nation's highest court. \nAll that was missing were the evening gowns. \nDespite what is expected to be a bitter vetting process in Congress, Gorsuch — a former Harvard Law classmate of Barack Obama — is almost all but assured a spot in the Honeymoon Suite, AKA, lifetime appointment. \nPresident Trump nominates Neil Gorsuch to Supreme Court \nHe will likely have the support of millions of viewers, or at least congressional Republicans too afraid to challenge the former reality show host from Queens turned POTUS. \nBefore his decision, Trump had summoned both of his “finalists” to Washington D.C. — a move to confuse the dastardly media who could’ve wrecked the whole thing with their lame “spoilers.” Judge Neil Gorsuch speaks after receiving the nomination from Trump. (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images) \nThe pick came halfway through Trump's second week in office and the opportunity to do so had been a key element of his campaign following the unexpected death of Antonin Scalia in 2016. \n“This may be the most transparent judicial selection process in history,” Trump said. “Millions of voters said this was the single most important issue for them when they voted for me — I am man of my word, I do what I say. This is something the American people have been waiting for from Washington for a very long, long time.” \nSupreme Court nominee Gorsuch's stance on the issues \nLike any good rose ceremony, the announcement of a SCOTUS pick was an obvious ratings grabber. And like any great TV stunt, Trump had been promoting his 8 p.m. telecast for days — mostly on Twitter and Facebook, just like networks and cable channels do. \n“Congratulations to you and your family,” Trump said to Gorsuch. \nAdding to the hype were dueling Twitter accounts for the potential justices. Each one created by the administration promoted the big telecast. Trump bypassed the media and offered his own coverage of the Supreme Court nomination. (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images) \nAll day Tuesday, leading up to the announcement, fake news outlets such as The New York Times and CNN, breathlessly reported how both Gorsuch and Hardiman had secretly been summoned to Washington by Trump. \nSCOTUS pick Neil Gorsuch has troubling views on judicial review \nCNN was even helpful enough to provide viewers with a tiny graphic in the corner of their television screens that provided a countdown to the announcement. \nBut fans of Trump really admired how the President was able to bypass the media entirely and offer his own coverage of the event on Facebook. \nThe pageantry and build-up to the selection was just so much bigger, better and far more exciting and yuge then the time when former President Barack Obama had presided over his deeply dignified Rose Garden announcement when he nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. \nIt was an event held in the morning — not primetime. Obviously that’s why Garland didn’t make it onto the bench — it had nothing to do with Republicans in Congress refusing to do their jobs. \nMorning TV is such a failure. It’s only for losers.
