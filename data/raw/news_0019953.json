The text ended with the laugh-cry emoji.\nMegan Dixon went for a job as a part-time waitress. Picture: Instagram/@megrdixon Source: Instagram \nMegan Dixon, 18, was rejected by a steakhouse. Picture: Instagram/@megrdixon Source: Instagram \nMs Dixon said she had been interviewed by the steakhouse branch’s assistant manager Shantel Wesson.\n“It was so rude. At the end of the interview, I asked when I would hear back. She told me it was never more than a few days and she had my email. But I got the texts a few seconds after leaving,” she said.\n“I was shocked. The least she should have given me was some proper feedback. And the laughing face emoji was so unprofessional. It was a really bitchy thing to do.”\nMegan Dixon, 18, tweeted a screenshot of the message and contacted the Miller and Carter Twitter account. Picture: Twitter/@megrdixon Source: Supplied \nShe said of the interview: “She didn’t even shake my hand, didn’t have my CV out and was just sat drinking a coffee. Maybe because I’m 18 she thinks it’s OK not to be professional with me? I don’t know.”\nMiller and Carter had advertised up to 50 jobs at the new branch in Enderby, Leicestershire, and student Ms Dixon wanted to earn some extra cash for college.\nMegan Dixon said she was interviewed by the branch’s assistant manager, Shantel Wesson. Picture: Twitter/@shantel84 Source: Supplied \nMs Wesson refused to comment but a Miller and Carter spokeswoman said: “We can’t apologise enough to Megan. It was never our intention to be disrespectful or upset her in any way. The texts were sent in error and were intended for our manager, not the candidate.”\nShe added it was being taken “extremely seriously” and would be investigated.\nThis story originally appeared in The Sun and has been republished here with permission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T16:11:24.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
