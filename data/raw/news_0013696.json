It's the worst parking fail I've ever seen - she shouldn't have a licence. 'I've seen some strange driving but nothing like this, when I saw her first two attempts I knew she wasn't going to make it so I quickly grabbed my phone and started filming. 'I was trying not to laugh as I was recording but as the footage shows, even when the other car left and there was plenty of space, it just wasn't her day.' Agonising footage shows the woman take 17 attempts to get in the spot and get out of her car four times to check distance The woman has allegedly hogged the spot over the past six years - though Mr Bhudia claims her fixation with the bay has lasted some 20 years The woman was apparently determined to shoe-horn her car into the spot outside her front door After five minutes the car in front drives off, leaving the woman with a free run at the space - but it still takes her another three and a half minutes to come to a standstill The bus driver said the woman was determined to shoe-horn her car into the spot outside her front door - despite him claiming there were plenty of other spaces on the road. He said: 'She always wants to park in the same spot outside her house and was determined to get in that space but it just wasn't happening. 'Two years ago I parked my car there and she actually came over and asked me to move it.' Mr Bhudia added: 'If I had been one of the cars being blocked I would have just got out of the car and parked it for her just to be able to get past - eight minutes is a long time to be waiting. 'I showed the video to my younger sister who's about to take her theory test and said 'this is someone beyond help'. 'When I first moved from driving a Vauxhall Corsa to a double-decker bus it was scary - I was so nervous. 'But after a certain amount of time your experience and confidence should improve but in her case it doesn't seem to have done.'
