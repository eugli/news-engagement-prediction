Close share panel As US President Donald Trump settles in to the White House, we look at the family members and associates who are part of the team and have key roles in decision-making during his presidency. THE POLITICIANS Vice-President Mike Pence \nThe former Indiana governor is charged with leading the team deciding the key appointments in the new administration. Media caption Trump's VP pick: what you need to know \nHe is a favourite among social conservatives who boasts considerable experience in Washington. \nMr Pence was raised Roman Catholic along with his five siblings in Columbus, Indiana, and says he was inspired by liberal icons John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. \nHe is known for his staunch opposition to abortion, signing a bill in March to ban abortion in Indiana on the basis of disability, gender or race of the foetus. \nHe has said he would favour overturning a 1973 Supreme Court judgement, often referred to as the Roe v Wade case, which bars the US government from prohibiting abortions. \nWomen's rights advocates have mounted online campaigns against his views, including asking people to call his office to tell them about their periods or to make donations to family-planning organisations in Mr Pence's name . \nHe served as the chair of the House Republican Conference, the third highest-ranking Republican leadership position. \nHe also chaired the Republican Study Group, a coalition of conservative House Republicans, which could give him a boost with some evangelicals of the party that have questioned Mr Trump's ideological purity, the BBC's Anthony Zurcher says. Rex Tillerson - Secretary of State Image copyright Reuters \nRex Tillerson, who was described by Mr Trump as \"a world-class player\", ran the world's most valuable, publicly-traded oil company before moving to the State Department. \nThe former head of Exxon Mobil is known for his close ties with Vladimir Putin; in 2013, the Kremlin gave the Texan an Order of Friendship award. \nRepublicans and Democrats questioned Mr Tillerson's links to the Russian president, and his appointment was also criticised by climate change activists, although he did say in his confirmation hearing that he believed climate change was a real threat. \nMr Tillerson had spent his entire career, more than 40 years, working for Exxon. \nHe joined the company as a production engineer, fresh from the University of Texas, Austin, and worked his way up to the top job in 2006. \nMr Tillerson had been expected to retire before being appointed to government. \nHe has made more than $240m just in the past decade as Exxon CEO and took a hefty pay cut as America's top diplomat, earning a relatively meagre $203,700 a year. HR McMaster - National Security Adviser Image copyright Reuters Image caption HR McMaster \nA lieutenant general with the US Army, HR McMaster served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he worked on a government anti-corruption drive. \nHe replaces Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after just three weeks and three days in the job because he misled Vice-President Mike Pence about his calls with the Russian ambassador. \nLt Gen McMaster is not known to have close ties to Moscow. \nTime magazine named him as one of its 100 most influential people in the world in 2014, saying he \"might be the 21st Century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker\". \nHe has a PhD in US history from the University of North Carolina. \nHe is also no stranger to questioning authority. In a 2014 interview, he said: \"The commanders that I've worked for, they want frank assessments, they want criticism and feedback.\" \nHis new role involves serving as an independent adviser to the president on issues of national security and foreign policy. \nWho is Herbert Raymond McMaster? Steven Mnuchin - Treasury Secretary \nMr Trump himself floated the idea of naming his finance chairman for the post of treasury secretary, before ultimately announcing him as his pick. \n\"Steve Mnuchin is a world-class financier, banker and businessman, and has played a key role in developing our plan to build a dynamic, booming economy that will create millions of jobs,\" Mr Trump said in a statement announcing his decision. \nNot all of Mr Trump's supporters have welcomed the idea of handing the levers of national tax policy to a consummate Wall Street insider. \nDuring his time running the OneWest bank, his business oversaw thousands of home foreclosures in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis. \nMr Mnuchin amassed a fortune during his 17 years at Goldman Sachs before founding a movie production company that was behind such box office hits as the X-Men franchise and American Sniper. \nFive things about Steve Mnuchin James Mattis - Secretary of Defence \nAfter meeting the retired Marine Corps general met in November, Mr Trump called him \"very impressive\", adding in a tweet that he was \"A true General's General!\" \nGen Mattis served in the Marine Corps for 44 years, fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. A counterinsurgency expert, he played a key role in fighting in Falluja in 2004. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Gen Mattis retired from the military in 2013 after more than four decades of service \nFrom 2010 to 2013 he led US Central Command, which covers an area from the Horn of Africa into Central Asia and includes all US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nHe is known for his blunt comments. In 2005 he was criticised after saying - in reference to Afghan men who \"slap women around... because they didn't wear a veil\" - that \"it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them\". \nBut he is also described as a popular leader well-liked by those he commanded, and an avid reader of literature on warfare. \nAs Gen Mattis retired in 2013, the law that bans military officers from serving as defence chief for seven years after leaving active duty was waived. \n'Warrior Monk' to head Pentagon John Kelly - Department of Homeland Security Secretary \nThe president nominated the retired Marine General to oversee Homeland Security, which is responsible for a number of security issues ranging from immigration and cyber hacking to airport security and natural disaster management. \nThe former four-star general, whose military career spans four decades, resigned in January 2017 after leaving his post as the head of the military's Southern Command, which oversees military activities in Latin America and the Caribbean. \nMr Kelly is the highest-ranking military officer to lose a child in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nHis son Robert, a first lieutenant in the Marines, was killed in combat when he stepped on a landmine in Afghanistan in 2010. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption US Marine Corps General John Kelly would be the third general Mr Trump has tapped for his administration \nThe seasoned commander had previously clashed with the Obama administration on illegal immigration at the US-Mexican border, an issue Mr Trump vowed to make a priority in office. \nMr Kelly becomes the third retired general to accept a high-level position in the Trump administration. Terry Branstad - Ambassador to China \nThe former Iowa governor has been called an \"old friend\" of Chinese President Xi Jinping. \n\"We welcome him to play a greater role in advancing the development of China-US relations,\" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang. \nThe two have known each other for more than 30 years, going back to Xi's trips to Iowa in the 1980s. \nChina is Iowa's second-largest export market, after Canada, according to the US-China Business Council,. The state sold $1.4bn in crop products to the Asian nation in 2015. \nMr Branstad was the longest-serving US governor, with two non-consecutive terms that began in 1983 and 2011. \nBefore he took Iowa's helm, he was elected to three terms in Iowa House of Representatives and later served as the state's lieutenant governor. Image copyright Pool Image caption Mr Branstad met Chinese President Xi Jinping at a forum for US and Chinese governors in 2015 \nPresident Xi and Mr Branstad first met during the governor's first term, in 1985, when China's future leader visited Iowa as a provincial agricultural official. \nMr Branstad, who has travelled to China four times in the past seven years, also hosted a dinner for Mr Xi during his visit to the state in 2012. \nMr Branstad was an early supporter for Mr Trump, and his son served as the president-elect's state campaign director in Iowa. \nHe shares many of Mr Trump's socially and fiscally conservative views - an advocate for small government and strongly pro-life. \nWho is Terry Branstad? Tom Price - Health and Human Services Secretary \nThe former Georgia congressman and orthopaedic surgeon chaired the House of Representatives budget committee and was an outspoken critic of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reforms. \nPreviously a six-term congressman, he is expected to play a key role in Republican plans to dismantle the Affordable Healthcare Act (Obamacare). \nHaving promised to replace the programme throughout his campaign, Mr Trump said details of an alternative were \"down to the final strokes\" in January 2017. \nThe president has said he favours keeping certain provisions such as allowing young adults to be insured on their parents' policies and barring insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Image copyright Reuters \nMr Price said he aimed to create a new system that worked for patients, families and doctors, adding that it should \"protect the well-being of the country while embracing its innovative spirit\". \nMr Trump praised Mr Price as a \"tireless problem solver\" who was \"exceptionally qualified to shepherd our commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare\". Elaine Chao - Transportation Secretary Image copyright AP \nElaine Chao could wield a great deal of influence in Mr Trump's cabinet if his plan to boost infrastructure spending and rebuild the nation's roads, bridges and other public transit comes to fruition. \nMs Chao, who was born in Taiwan, became the first Asian-American woman to hold a position in a presidential cabinet when she led the Labor Department under President Bush from 2001-09. \nMs Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, served as deputy secretary of transportation and director of the Peace Corps in former President George HW Bush's administration. \nShe came to the US with her family at the age of eight and settled in New York, where her father became a shipping magnate. \nMs Chao becomes the second person to hold the positions of labor secretary, transportation secretary and the spouse of a Senate majority leader. \nElizabeth Dole previously held that title. Jeff Sessions - Attorney General \nMr Sessions had been one of Mr Trump's closest allies throughout the campaign, and his loyalty was rewarded when he became the nation's top prosecutor. \n\"We need a lawful system of immigration,\" Mr Sessions said after he was sworn in by vice-president Mike Pence in the White House Oval Office. \n\"One that serves the interest of the people of the United States. That's not wrong, that's not immoral, that's not indecent.\" \nIn a statement , Mr Trump called the senator from Alabama a \"world class legal mind\". Image copyright AFP \nHe was a supporter of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, which Mr Trump recently called \"a terrible and stupid thing\". \nMr Sessions sat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Judiciary Committee and the Budget Committee. \nAllegations of racism have dogged him throughout his career, and were raised during his confirmation hearing in the Senate. \nHe lost out on a federal judgeship back in 1986 when former colleagues said he had used the n-word and joked about the Ku Klux Klan, saying he thought they were \"okay, until he learned that they smoked marijuana\". In his confirmation hearing, he called the KKK allegation \"damnably false\". \nMr Sessions has also been accused of calling a black assistant US attorney \"boy\" and labelling the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \"un-American\" and \"communist-inspired.\" \nDuring the hearing, he acknowledged \"the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our African-American brothers and sisters\". Mike Pompeo - CIA Director \nThe hardline Republican Congressman is the United States' new spymaster. \nMr Pompeo was offered the job of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director even though he backed US President-elect Donald Trump's rival, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, in the party's presidential primary race. Image copyright AP \nThe three-term tea party Republican from Wichita, Kansas, is a vehement critic of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran and has defended the National Security Agency's bulk data collection programme. \nHe also opposes closing Guantanamo Bay and, after visiting the prison in 2013, he remarked that some inmates who had declared a hunger strike looked like they had put on weight. \nMr Pompeo said in a statement he was \"honoured and humbled\" to accept the nomination, noting that it was a \"difficult decision\" to leave his post. Reince Priebus - Chief of Staff Image copyright Reuters \nMr Trump's White House gatekeeper was chairman of the Republican National Committee, and acted as a bridge between the Republican nominee and a party establishment that was embarrassed by its own presidential standard-bearer. \nBut he has never held elected office and brings no policy experience to the White House in a role serving as a liaison to cabinet agencies. \nMr Priebus is close to House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Wisconsinite, who could be instrumental in steering the new administration's legislative agenda. Nikki Haley - US Ambassador to the UN Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mrs Haley was critical of Mr Trump during his presidential campaign \nIn the Republican primaries, Nikki Haley, then the governor of South Carolina, first backed Florida Senator Marco Rubio and later Texas Senator Ted Cruz before she finally threw her support behind Mr Trump. \nShe was highly critical of Mr Trump's proposal to ban Muslim immigrants, calling it \"un-American\", and also of his refusal to release tax records. \nAnnouncing her as the first woman chosen for his cabinet, Mr Trump called her \"a proven dealmaker\" who will be \"a great leader representing us on the world stage\". \nNikki Haley, the Republican who took on Trump \nThe daughter of Indian immigrants, Mrs Haley was the first minority and female governor of South Carolina, a deeply conservative state with a long history of racial tensions. \nAs the youngest governor in the US and only the second Indian-American to serve at the helm of a US state, she has been characterised as a rising star within the Republican Party. \nBefore becoming the state's chief executive, she served six years as a member of the state's House of Representatives. \nBut her biggest appearance on the national stage came in 2015, when she had the Confederate battle flag removed from her state's Capitol building. Rick Perry - Energy Secretary \nThe former Texas governor heads an agency he proposed to eliminate during his failed 2012 presidential campaign. \nThe recent Dancing with the Stars contestant was a vocal critic of Mr Trump, calling him a \"barking carnival act\" and a \"cancer on conservatism\" before he dropped out of his second unsuccessful bid for the White House in 2015. Image copyright Getty Images \nAs governor of Texas, Mr Perry called for lighter regulation on the oil industry and referred to the science around climate change as \"unsettled\". \nEnvironmental activists are concerned Mr Perry will shift the department's focus on renewable energy toward fossil fuels. \nHe also sits on the board of directors at Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. \nRock Perry picked as US energy secretary Betsy DeVos - Education Secretary \nBetsy DeVos became the second woman nominated for a cabinet position when Mr Trump named her as education secretary. \nMrs DeVos, a wealthy Republican Party donor and a former Michigan Republican Party chairwoman, said she was honoured to accept the appointment. \nHowever, in an interview last March she described Mr Trump as \"an interloper\" who didn't represent the Republican Party. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Betsy DeVos has supported the Common Core education standards that Mr Trump has criticised \nMrs DeVos is an advocate of Republican-favoured charter schools, which are publicly funded and set up by teachers, parents, or community groups, outside the state school system. \nShe also previously supported the Common Core education standards that Mr Trump and many conservatives have pilloried. \nMr Trump called her \"a brilliant and passionate education advocate\" but she was criticised after appearing to struggle at times during her nomination hearing. \nHer support of charter schools and lack of political experience have generated fierce opposition, with two Republicans voting against her nomination.
