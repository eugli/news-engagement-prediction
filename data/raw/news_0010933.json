Maybe same short, tiny fingers tapping the smart phone, different tweets. \nPoint is, Donald Trump is at it again. \nRemember how late Friday night, a Federal judge blocked Trump's Muslim ban executive order? Trump tweeted a bunch about the \"so-called\" judge yesterday to much controversy . \nAnd now, today, here we are again. \nJust look! In the last hour, here's what Trump's tiny fingers have been tweeting out to the world (below): \nJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 \nI have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 \nHmm… \nBut, huckster that he is, Trump wouldn't go through with any of this without tweeting a little self-promotion, too!!! \nRelated: It's A Bad Day To Be A Trump… \nGo for it, Donald: \nI will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor at 4:00 P.M. (prior to the #SuperBowl Pre-game Show) on Fox Network. Enjoy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 \nUgh. \nShameless and ignorant — a horrible, horrible combination. \nDonald, seriously, just go watch the damn Super Bowl and stop tweeting for a few hours. \nToo much to ask?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:24:20.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
