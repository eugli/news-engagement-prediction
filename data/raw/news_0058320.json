Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com \nST. LOUIS • A lawsuit to force a public vote on the city’s $64 million bond for Scottrade Center renovations was unceremoniously withdrawn Tuesday just hours after it was filed. \nThe lawsuit sought to revive a 2002 voter-approved ordinance that was struck down by a circuit court judge in 2015. But the ordinance exempted professional sports facilities built before 2004, and Scottrade Center opened in 1994. \nAfter City Counselor Michael Garvin told the Post-Dispatch the ordinance wouldn’t apply to Scottrade Center, the lawyers who filed the lawsuit withdrew it “in light of this development.” \n“However, they [plaintiffs] are pursuing additional options at this time to ensure voter participation with regard to public funding of sports facilities,” John Ammann, one of the lawyers and a St. Louis University law professor, said in an email Tuesday afternoon. \nLast week Mayor Francis Slay signed a bill approving $64 million in renovations to Scottrade Center, the home of the St. Louis Blues hockey team. With money for renovations coming from a loan taken by the city, the total costs with interest would top $100 million over 30 years. \nThe Board of Aldermen passed the bill Feb. 10 after a contentious meeting , on a vote of 15-12. \nTuesday’s lawsuit was filed on behalf of city residents Jeanette Oxford and Michael Chance, both of whom were involved in the effort to pass the ordinance in 2002. \nThe 2002 ordinance excludes “any such facility which is in existence and accommodating such games on the date of enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter,” according to Section 3.91.010 of the ordinance. \nBlues representatives did not respond to requests for comment. \nIn a decision invalidating the ordinance in 2015, Circuit Judge Thomas Frawley wrote that it was “too vague to be enforced.” \nThe law has so many “uncertainties,” he wrote in his ruling , “their sum makes a task for us which at best could be only guesswork.” \nTeam is prohibited from practicing until late Saturday afternoon and won’t play again until Sunday in Chicago.
