But it wasn't because of any ridiculous loss of form but because their match was postponed. Now they're considering some drastic action. \nZinedine Zidane's team recently broke Barcelona's unbeaten run by going 40 games unbeaten at the start of the year, and it never looked like it would come to an end. \nHowever their run came to an end just three days after they broke the record in a loss to Sevilla in the league and then lost to Celta Vigo in the cup a few days later. \nAt the weekend they again failed to pick up any points but that was because their La Liga game with Celta was postponed for safety reasons after the stadium was damaged. \nAnd, according to Spanish paper Marca , Los Blancos are so annoyed with the league's organisation and the decision to postpone the game that they're considering quitting La Liga for a European Super League. \nThe idea of a European Super League has been floated for quite some time with bigger clubs desperate to make more money, especially to compete with the Premier League's wealth. \nMany believe the league is inevitable in some guise or another and UEFA have made moves to quell the need for such thing with more power to the bigger leagues qualification for the Champions League. \nIt's been thought that a 'Super League' would be more likely to replace the Champions League than national leagues but according to the report Real are thinking about quitting La Liga. \nCheck out our Once Upon a Time in Madrid video, what a team this was: \nAny moves to do so could have a huge knock on effect to the rest of European football and it would be interesting to see if any other Spanish clubs followed suit. \nAlaves are also annoyed at the postponement of the weekend's games as they play Celta in the Copa del Rey semi-final this week and it has given their opponents longer to rest in preparation. \nWhilst the threat of losing Real must be taken seriously dropping out of the league over this would look like a huge overreaction.
