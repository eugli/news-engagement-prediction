Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here BENGALURU: As Karnataka prepares to receive AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala’s surrender and subsequently house her in the Parappana Agrahara jail , the state’s chief minister Siddaramaiah stuck to an apolitical line and said the apex court’s orders were just being followed. Karnataka has had a tough role to maintain in this legal battle as there was tremendous backroom pressure from Tamil Nadu through issues like the Cauvery dispute, to back off. Karnataka, however, went ahead with the against former chief minister J Jayalalithaa and her aide Sasikala, as Siddaramaiah opted to take the case to its legal end. He consistently maintained, all through the trial that the state has no political stake. “I have not seen the verdict.

The trial court judge in Karnataka, John Michael Cunha, convicted all the accused and sent them to jail in 2014. This judgement, however, was overturned by Justice C R Kumaraswamy in the Karnataka High Court in May 2015, paving way for Jayalalithaa to become the CM of Tamil Nadu again.

They dragged us through the wringer on the Cauvery issue, despite it being a severe drought year,” a senior Karnataka bureaucrat said. “The indirect issue was that their CM wanted us to ease off on the disproportionate assets issue. We went ahead despite this pressure, our CM had had committed to the legal course of action,” he added. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!
