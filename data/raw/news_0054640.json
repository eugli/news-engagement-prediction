We have a right to speak up.” \nMr. Trump ’s vast business holdings have been a point of contention for the president’s critics since before he took office last month. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a political watchdog group, sued Mr. Trump three days after his inauguration for alleged violations of the Emoluments Clause, and asked a federal judge to force the president to stop taking payments from foreign governments. \n“President Trump has made his slogan ‘America First,’” CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said when the suit was filed last month. “So you would think he would want to strictly follow the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, since it was written to ensure our government officials are thinking of Americans first, and not foreign governments.” \nRichmond’s City Council is served by seven representatives including Mayor Tom Butt, a Democrat who recently compared Mr. Trump ’s position on climate change to ideas espoused during “the dark ages.” \n“I was reminded that the times we are going through with Trump are not unlike the Dark Ages, when reclusive monks in remote monasteries copied and preserved ancient Greek and Latin manuscripts until they could be rediscovered in the Renaissance,” Mr. Butt wrote in an open letter last month. \n“Every day, the Trump administration becomes more incredibly unbelievable,” he wrote.
