Carr and the Raiders had Super Bowl aspirations in 2016, but losing Carr basically put an end to all of that. Meet the ripped athletes who took down the Atlanta Falcons. \nAt the time of the injury, the Raiders were 12-3 and had a first-round playoff bye all but locked up, but the stunning loss of Carr tripped up the team: The Raiders finished the season with a loss to the Broncos, lost their backup quarterback Matt McGloin to an injury, ended up as the fifth seed in the playoffs, then saw rookie Connor Cook make his first-ever start in the wild-card round loss to the Houston Texans. \nBut the future for the Raiders is very bright. Carr is expected to return to full health after passing for 3,937 yards and 28 touchdowns with a career-low six interceptions last season. Meanwhile, wideout Amari Cooper is a budding superstar, the offensive line is stacked, and linebacker Khalil Mack comes into 2017 after winning the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award. \nCarr is ready for a big 2017—he can’t be stopped, even on leg day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:08:20.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
