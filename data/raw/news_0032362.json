Stay away from them.\"\nFederer won his 18th Grand Slam singles title at last month's Australian Open, beating old foe Rafael Nadal in a Melbourne final few pundits had foreseen.\nMurray, by contrast, suffered a shock fourth round defeat at the hands of the unheralded Mischa Zverev .\nFederer's success in Australia, at the relatively advanced age, in tennis terms, of 35 came following a long spell out with injury and a self-imposed break.\nAnd double Olympic champion Murray, 29, said he might now reduce his schedule in a bid to prolong his career.\n\"It's incredible what he did in Australia after such a long break,\" Murray, a three-time Grand Slam-winner, said. \"We play so much, a lot of the year. Sometimes coming to events fresh can have some huge advantage.\n\"Him and Rafa were both coming back from a pretty significant period of time out and they both played extremely well. Maybe that's something we can all learn from moving forwards.\"\nFederer decided to take up Murray's invitation after the Scot took part in the Swiss ace's charity event in April.\nSuch is Federer's global popularity that sell-out-crowds at Glasgow's 10,800-capacity SSE Hydro are expected.\n\"I saw a little video where he was wearing a kilt when he was announcing that I was going to play in his event over in Switzerland,\" said Murray. \"He's returning the favour in November. It's really good he's doing it.\n\"He's just extremely popular. He's one of the best players that's ever played the game.\n\"It's not just how much he's won, but the way he plays and how he carries himself.\"\nFederer will be helping raise funds that will be shared equally between UNICEF , the United Nations ' children's fund and an as yet unnamed local Scottish charity.\n\"Last year was such a fantastic night and to raise over Â£300,000 for UNICEF and Young People's Futures (a Glasgow-based children's charity) in our first year was amazing,\" said Murray, a UK ambassador for UNICEF.\n\"This year is going to be even bigger and better and I am so pleased to be able to bring Roger to play in Scotland for the first time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:09:11.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
