I don’t want to cite the sources because I don’t want to give them any more attention,” he posted on his Tumblr page.\nPewDiePie “I picked something that seemed absurd to me—That people on Fiverr would say anything for 5 dollars.\n“I think it’s important to say something and I want to make one thing clear: I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes.\n“I make videos for my audience. I think of the content that I create as entertainment, and not a place for any serious political commentary. I know my audience understand that and that is why they come to my channel. Though this was not my intention, I understand that these jokes were ultimately offensive.”\nHighest-paid YouTube stars of 2016", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:44:38.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
