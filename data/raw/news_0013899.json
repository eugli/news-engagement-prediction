(AP Photo/Andres Kudacki) (Photo: The Associated Press) \nNEW YORK (AP) â€” LeBron James had 32 points and 10 assists, Kevin Love added 23 points and 16 rebounds in his return from back spasms, and the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the New York Knicks 111-104 on Saturday night. \nThe Cavaliers won for the ninth straight time against the Knicks and didn't even need Kyrie Irving, who didn't play because of right quadriceps soreness. \nLove was back after missing two games and showed why the NBA champions may have no reason to entertain the trade rumors involving him and Carmelo Anthony that surround the teams. \nBrandon Jennings had 23 points and 10 assists in place of point guard Derrick Rose, who missed his fourth straight game with a sprained left ankle. Anthony and Courtney Lee each added 17 points. \nJames became the youngest player to surpass 28,000 points in leading the Cavs to their seventh straight win at Madison Square Garden. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
