Until now, researchers were unable to examine heavy elements with optical spectroscopy because these elements do not ... Team uncovers fundamental property of astatine, rarest atom on Earth May 14, 2013 \nAn international team of scientists, including a University of York researcher, has carried out ground-breaking experiments to investigate the atomic structure of astatine (Z=85), the rarest naturally occurring element on ... Isotope program provides target material for the discovery of superheavy elements May 18, 2016 \nTwo isotopes of a new element with atomic number Z=117 were created by an international collaboration in the reaction between unique radioactive 249Bk target material produced at ORNL through the DOE Isotope Program and an ... French particle accelerator to embark on 'exotic' quest November 2, 2016 \nLong thought to be the smallest building blocks of all matter, we now know atoms are themselves composed of electrons spinning around a nucleus made of protons and neutrons. Researchers generate proton beams using a combination of nanoparticles and laser light September 30, 2016 \nLight, when strongly concentrated, is enormously powerful. Now, a team of physicists led by Professor Jörg Schreiber from the Institute of Experimental Physics – Medical Physics, which is part of the Munich-Centre for ... The race to find even more new elements to add to the periodic table January 5, 2016 \nIn an event likely never to be repeated, four new superheavy elements were last week simultaneously added to the periodic table. To add four in one go is quite an achievement but the race to find more is ongoing. Recommended for you Unravelling the atomic and nuclear structure of the heaviest elements February 22, 2017 \nLittle is known about the heaviest, radioactive elements in Mendeleev's table. But an extremely sensitive technique involving laser light and gas jets makes it possible for the very first time to gain insight into their atomic ... Scientists create a nano-trampoline to probe quantum behavior February 22, 2017 \nA research group from Bar-Ilan University, in collaboration with French colleagues at CNRS Grenoble, has developed a unique experiment to detect quantum events in ultra-thin films. This novel research, to be published in ... Proposed test would offer strongest evidence yet that the quantum state is real February 21, 2017 \n(Phys.org)—Physicists are getting a little bit closer to answering one of the oldest and most basic questions of quantum theory: does the quantum state represent reality or just our knowledge of reality? Dream of energy-collecting windows is one step closer to reality February 21, 2017 \nResearchers at the University of Minnesota and University of Milano-Bicocca are bringing the dream of windows that can efficiently collect solar energy one step closer to reality thanks to high tech silicon nanoparticles. Engineers overcome a hurdle in growing a revolutionary optical metamaterial February 21, 2017 \nWhen John Crocker, a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering in the University of Pennsylvania's School of Engineering and Applied Science was a graduate student, his advisor gathered together everyone in his lab ... Scientists combine the ultra-fast with the ultra-small to pioneer microscopy at terahertz frequencies February 21, 2017 \nFor the first time ever, scientists have captured images of terahertz electron dynamics of a semiconductor surface on the atomic scale.
