It is motivated by the need to negotiate a better deal for the ordinary Nigerian. \n“I therefore announce the cancellation of the planned protest. \n“We would share further information in due course. We appreciate the massive support. \n“I am convinced our voices have been heard. \n“May God bless you all, may God bless Nigeria.” \nThe planned protest gained traction with several public figures including Gov Fayose of Ekiti State and civil society groups pledging to be part of it on Monday. \nTuface called for nationwide protest against Nigeria’s worsening economic crisis that has seen costs of goods and services skyrocket, with many families struggling to survive. \nBut police warned against the protest after initially promising to provide security.
