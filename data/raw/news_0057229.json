Give the public a break - The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2017 \nW hile his invention of a non-existent terrorist incident was rightly ridiculed, the issue of immigrant integration in Sweden is a real one and bears closer examination . Sweden is seeing record levels of immigration and asylum applications \nSweden has been very welcoming to immigrants over the past decade, with 163,000 people entering the country in 2016 - 100,000 more than the number who did so in 2000. Chart - Immigration in Sweden \nW hile immigrants from EU countries have more than doubled over this 17-year period, the biggest increases have been in people coming to Sweden from Africa and Asia. \nFigures from Statistics Sweden show that 76,145 immigrants from Asian countries came to Sweden in 2016, more than five times the number who came from Asia in 2000. Immigration from African countries has increased by even more than this, however, just 18,000 immigrants came from Africa last year. \nSweden's approach to refugees has been similarly welcoming, with the country receiving 162,877 applications for asylum in 2015 - a record number. Chart - asylum applications to Sweden \nM ore than half of these refugees came from war-torn countries such as Syria (51,000) and Iraq (20,000) - and they include a very large number of unaccompanied children. \nThis generous approach to refugees was halted mid-way through 2016 when the Swedish Parliament voted by 240 to 45 to toughen the rules around asylum to ease the burden on the Swedish welfare system. \nThis rule-change has seen a big drop in asylum applications to Sweden with numbers down by 82 per cent between 2016 and 2015. Integration not crime is the issue facing Swedes \nSweden's crime rates are typically low compared with other nations and - contrary to Trump's belief - there hasn't been a refugee-driven crime wave in recent years. \nIn fact, the latest figures show that the rate of crimes against life and health have actually decreased in recent years. \nH owever, doesn't mean that the large recent influx of immigrants has been without issue. \nSweden's population of just under 10 million is small compared to the number of people it has accepted - consequently it has one of the highest rates of immigration in Europe. \nIntegrating this level of migrants into the general population is an ongoing issue in Sweden, with a recent YouGov poll showing that Swedes think the most pressing issue currently facing their country is immigration and refugee policy. Chart - polls shows immigration is concern for Swedes \nE mployment rates among the native-born population are far higher than among those born abroad, with only the Netherlands experiencing more inequality in this regard according to the OECD. \nThe same is true of the proportion of Swedes living in relative poverty. More than one in four Swedes living in immigrant households are currently in poverty while the figure is 15.4 per cent for those living in native-born households. \nWhile these tensions haven't resulted in an explosion of crime, the problems are bubbling away under the surface and the far-right Swedish Democrats are gaining more support ahead of the 2018 election.
