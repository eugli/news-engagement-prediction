The actor who had been shooting in Dubai since the last few days for Ram Gopal Varma 's 'Sarkar 3', in which he plays the antagonist, the former underworld don Michael Vallya, is back in the Bay in time for his milestone birthday. Jackie Shroff: I have always found Tiger passionate about his work Jackie liked his son's recent film 'A Flying Jatt' for its message on environmental pollution. His 26-year old son Tiger and 24-year old daughter Krishna who have been busy with Sabbir Khan 's upcoming dance film, 'Munna Michael', which has the former playing the protagonist and Krishna as an assistant director, have a few surprises up their sleeve for daddy. \"Unfortunately, we can't celebrate the occasion together this year since Tiger and I will be shooting. But mom (Ayesha Shroff), Tiger, and I are planning to surprise him with a trip to Goa. This used to be a family tradition. Goa is like a second home for both Tiger and me and some of our best childhood memories are associated with the beach state and our parents,\" informed Krishna. Pointing out that her dad, fondly called Jaggu Dada - has never been a materialistic guy having grown up in a chawl in Malabar Hill's Teen Batti area, she admitted that choosing gifts for him was difficult. \"He's happy spending time with the three of us, going out for lunches or dinners. If it's just the two of us, we sometimes go for long drives late in the night since mom and Tiger usually go to bed quite early,\" she shared. When quizzed on whether they had any rituals for the birthday, Krishna revealed that they usually just send out cake and some necessities like stationary and blankets to distribute at a nearby orphanage. \"We do it on the birthdays of every member of the family. Dad doesn't like talking about it, but that's what we do,\" asserted the doting daughter who recalls one particular birthday of her dad's from her childhood years when the house was filled with flowers and loads of guests streamed in. \"I remember telling mom that our house looks like a beautiful garden on this day every year,\" she smiled at the memory.
