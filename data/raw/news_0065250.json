She stuck with the promotion through 2012, but would leave the WWE by the end of that year. \nShe worked the independent circuit following her stint with WWE but focused more on her modeling career, which she was building up before becoming a professional wrestler. Kelly is also one of the cast members of WAGS, an E! reality television series. \nIf Kelly does indeed make a return, it won't be at a full-time capacity. \n“I would come back for like a run, a mini-run or something,\" Kelly told Menounos. \nStill, getting her back in the fold even at a smaller capacity could make for a fun reunion with the former champion. \nWould you be interested in seeing Kelly Kelly make a return to the WWE?
