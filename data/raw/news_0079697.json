Together, they've made a record to file alongside French synth-pop classics by Phoenix and M83 . \nMade using analogue equipment and utilising Bouaziz's own unique recording techniques, Without Warning – the follow-up to Juveniles' 2013 debut album – is an emotional, song-packed affair that grooves wistfully and effortlessly through dance music history: from disco to techno and acid house. \nBefore the album drops, we're premiering the video for the first single from it: Someone Better . \"It's an amorous lament embedded in a catchy straight-to-the-point song,\" explains Sylvain. \"I tend to avoid writing pop songs for the sake of it, instead I aim for a balance, a 'Dancing under a monochromatic mirrorball' vibe you can’t quite get your head around. \n\"As a result this song has a more poetic licence approach to emphasise its 'summer anthem' theme, being an egocentric and unapologetic counterpart to Love Me Forever another song on our second album Without Warning.\" \nWatch the video for Someone Better directed by Rodrigue Huart above – and pre-order Without Warning .
