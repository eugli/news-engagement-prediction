We have rights, we have obligations, and we have Parliament,\" he said, adding that decisions executed by the executive must be \"on the basis of the expressed authority of the Constitution\". \nMojapelo said, if the authority was not expressed in the Constitution, it must go to Parliament. \nGauntlett asked the court to dismiss the DA's case with costs. \nIn his rebuttal, Steven Budlender, for the DA, said the letter the executive had sent to Parliament contained no suggestion that the decision to withdraw from the ICC would be debated. \n\"It does not suggest that Parliament has to approve it. The effect is to bypass Parliament. It is simply telling Parliament for informational purposes,\" Budlender told the court. \nBudlender said it was irrational for the executive to unbind from the ICC because it had no alternative. \nOn October 21, Justice Minister Michael Masutha told reporters that South Africa had initiated the process of withdrawing from the ICC by notifying the United Nations of its intention to revoke its ratification of the Rome Statute, the ICC's founding treaty. It would take a year for the decision to come into effect. \nThe decision followed several court judgments that the government violated the law by not arresting Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir during his visit to South Africa for an African Union summit in June last year. \n24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24 We reserve editorial discretion to decide what will be published.
