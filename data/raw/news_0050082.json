UFC star Conor McGregor (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:24 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:24 a.m. ET \nConor McGregor would “have his hands full\" against Floyd Mayweather Jr., longtime boxing trainer Freddie Roach said Monday on \"The MMA Hour\" podcast ( via MMAFighting.com ), but he thinks the UFC champion won't be the boxing pushover many predict. \nSaying the bout \"looks like it’s gonna happen,\" Roach offered up the best shot McGregor has. \nMORE: Floyd Mayweather fires back at Conor McGregor \n“He is a pretty good striker,” Roach said of McGregor. “The thing is, Floyd is a great boxer. He’s really good at hitting and not getting hit and so forth. I think it would take a long time for Conor to get ready for a boxing match, a pure boxing match. But, y'know, one punch can change everything. It’s the sport we’re in. I’m not gonna count him out completely. I think Mayweather is the favorite, yes, but I wouldn’t count anyone out. Because he throws, he throws hard and he’s not afraid to throw.” \nStill, McGregor's boxing experience is only at the amateur level. Even as an elite MMA fighter, he would need to be trained up to face one of the best pound-for-pound boxers in history. \nAnd that's a job Roach says he'd be interested in. The stumbling block: Roach has a current coaching relationship with Georges St-Pierre, for whom Roach helped broker a new deal to return to the UFC. \n“I would like to try to help [McGregor] to get ready,” Roach said. “That would be an honor for me, yes. Right now, Georges is my main concern. Georges has first priority at this point.” Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:47:20.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
