(Find out what it’s like to have dementia before age 60, from 5 real guys who received the Alzheimer’s diagnosis .) \nWhat’s more, the researchers also discovered that people who slept for a longer duration also had lower brain volumes and poorer processing speeds and functions than those who slept in that 6 to 9 hour sweet spot. \nSo, what does that mean for your love of sleeping in? Importantly, the researchers believe that trying to make long sleeper snooze for a shorter period of time likely won’t do anything to reduce their risk of dementia. That’s because they think that sleeping long is more so a marker of the degeneration in your brain’s neurons that is linked to dementia—not that long sleep is somehow causing the brain changes associated with dementia.
