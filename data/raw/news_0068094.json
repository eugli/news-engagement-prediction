Rec Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports The Indiana Pacers have reached out to multiple teams in an attempt to clear roster spots, according to ESPN.com’s Brian Windhorst . The move to make room could be in relation to a potential Paul George trade to the Boston Celtics . More than a few rival executives feel the Celtics have a legitimate chance at landing George, according to ESPN.com’s Marc Stein . But The Vertical’s Adrian Wojnarowski reports there is no significant progress on a deal between Indiana and Boston. The Pacers currently have 15 guaranteed contracts on the roster and would take back multiple players and draft picks in any deal involving George. Clearing a few spots would be the logical first step. After trade discussions revolving around Chicago Bulls All-Star Jimmy Butler broke down, the Celtics shifted their focus to acquiring the Pacers star. Those discussions ramped up when Boston made the Brooklyn Nets ’ 2017 first-round pick available. George has publicly clamored for the chance to play for a championship , and the 29-28 Pacers’ modest offseason improvements failed to launch the team into contention. Indiana has attempted to add talent alongside its four-time All-Star as the trade deadline approaches, inquiring about Philadelphia’s Jahlil Okafor and Brooklyn’s Brook Lopez. Those discussions have yet to gain traction. George becomes an unrestricted free agent in the summer of 2018, and Indiana has little ability to substantially improve this summer.
