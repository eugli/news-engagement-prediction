Because in Donald Trump's America, the prediction game isn't just about who's going to win, but who's going to make the most politically-charged statement of the evening. Here's a rundown of all the major political moments from the 2017 Grammy Awards. 1. Joy Villa's \"Make America Great Again\" dress Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The political controversy kicked off way before the ceremony itself, when singer Joy Villa made this bold fashion choice on the red carpet : a skintight red, white, and blue number blaring both Donald Trump's name and his campaign slogan in huge letters, which she dramatically unveiled from under a white cape. 2. James Corden raps about Donald Trump's immigration ban Getty The inevitable Trump shout-out came early on in the show: \"With President Trump we don't know what comes next / We sit here tonight, don't matter our race, where we were born or color of face / using this art, remember forever, we can survive by sticking together,\" Corden rapped in his opening number. Most Popular 3. Jennifer Lopez quotes Toni Morrison Getty J.Lo took the stage to remind the assembled crowd of creatives of the value—and responsibility—they have at politically unstable times like this. \"This is precisely the time when artists go to work,\" she said, quoting Toni Morrison. \"No time for despair, no place for self pity, no need for silence & no room for fear. We do language.\" 4. Paris Jackson's Dakota Access Pipeline shout-out Getty While introducing The Weeknd, 18-year-old Paris Jackson told the crowd: \"We could really use this kind of excitement at a pipeline protest, y'all.\" 5. Katy Perry promotes the Constitution alongside hew new single Getty Outspoken Hillary Clinton speaker Perry was always going to make some kind of statement, and her performance was a powerful reminder that visuals can speak louder than words. During her performance of new single 'Chained To The Rhythm', Perry wore a \"RESIST\" armband, and later appeared in front of a backdrop where lines from the Constitution were projected in huge letters. As several people on Twitter suggested, maybe she's hoping Donald Trump will finally read it now that it's on TV. 6. Beyonce's potent 'Lemonade' speech Getty Bey's speech was arguably the most articulate and passionate of the night, and though she kept overt politics to a minimum, her message was clear as she discussed her artistic intentions with 'Lemonade'. \" My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that would give a voice to our pain — our struggles, our darkness, and our history. To confront issues that make us uncomfortable. It's important for me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first through their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House, and the Grammys, and see themselves, and have no doubt that they're beautiful, intelligent, and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race, and I feel it's vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes. \" Amen to that, now more than ever.
