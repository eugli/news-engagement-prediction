Together, they function to provide a system of lawmaking and enforcement based on checks and balances, and separation of powers intended to ensure that no individual or body of government ever becomes too powerful. For example: \nCongress ( legislative branch ) can pass laws, but the president ( executive branch ) can veto them.\nCongress can override the president's veto.\nThe Supreme Court ( judicial branch ) can declare a law approved by Congress and the president unconstitutional.\nThe president can appoint judges to the Supreme Court, but Congress must approve them. \nIs the system perfect? Are powers ever abused? Of course, but as governments go, ours has been working quite well since Sept. 17, 1787. As Alexander Hamilton and James Madison remind us in Federalist 51 , \"If men were angels, no government would be necessary.\" \ncontinue reading below our video Checks and Balances in the U.S. Government \nRecognizing the inherent moral paradox posed by a society in which mere mortals govern other mere mortals, Hamilton and Madison went on to write, \"In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.\" \nThe executive branch of the United States government consists of the president, the vice president and 15 Cabinet-level executive departments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:17:42.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
