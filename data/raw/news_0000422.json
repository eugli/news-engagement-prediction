She said the company has to meet with GE Grid, their client, about new priorities and a new scope of work.\n\"We would certainly not say at this stage that there are any layoffs imminent,\" she told CBC News. \"Pennecon is temporarily demobilizing a crew.\"\n\"We've just had a couple of changes to the scope of work, so we need a couple of days to sit down with the client and clarify what that means for our scope of work and our priorities when it comes to execution.\"\nNo date has been set for work to resume, but Constantine said Pennecon was anticipating the talks to only take a few days.\nGE Canada did not immediately return a request for comment.\nConstantine said that under the terms of the workers' contract, employees are paid hourly, and therefor they are not being paid while they are demobilized.\nWorkers were sent home Friday afternoon. Constantine said they learned about the situation Thursday or Friday.\nWith files from Katie Breen", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/L29hUTxg1pU"], "published": "2017-02-04T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:18:58.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
