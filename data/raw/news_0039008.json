WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE? Crisp, fresh and delicately floral, the fruity aromas of Progrigio are balanced by a dry profile that offers a hint of sweetness at the finish. Designed to be served in a flute glass, the versatility of Progrigio also means it's suitable as the base to a sparkling cocktail. ASDA claim the new Progrigio tastes just like Prosecco but at a lower price point, ensuring Brits will still be clinking glasses with an affordable fizz. Ed Betts, Asda wine buying manager said: 'We always strive to keep prices as low as possible without compromising on quality and we believe Progrigio is the ideal affordable sparkling wine alternative.' 'We want to protect the demand for sparkling wine by offering customers more choice, and by moving slightly away from the Prosecco region we have discovered a great example of quality fizz at an everyday price.'
