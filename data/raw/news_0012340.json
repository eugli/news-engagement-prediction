Boy, five, dies after choking on his food during his lunch break at school \nSupermarkets like Tesco, Sainsburyâ€™s and Morrisons are rationing broccoli â€“ with some only offering three heads of the vegetable per customer. \nEarlier this week, shoppers were faced with empty produce shelves as they tried to snatch the reaming lettuces. Empty shelves at a Tesco store as UK the brunt of the veg crisis (Picture: PA/Rob Gregory) \nAnd these shortages have affected other seasonal veg like courgettes, white salad peppers and cabbage. \nA notice on an empty Tesco shelve read: â€˜Due to continued weather problems in Spain there is a shortage of iceberg lettuce. \nâ€˜To protect the availability to all our customers, we are limiting bulk purchases to three per person.â€™ #FirstWorldProblems Shortage of Icebergs so let's limited everyone to 3 a customer.. even limited supply now! pic.twitter.com/izJhlYCHmo \nâ€” Paul Womble Brewer (@_Brewer_) January 31, 2017 \nBut why has this happened? \nA cold snap across Europe has led to poor growing condition, mostly in Italy and Spain where much of the vegetable stock is imported from. \nThis is down to a combination of frosty weather, flooding and a lack of light. \nMurcia in Spain supplies around 80% of Europeâ€™s vegetables, but the city has suffered its heaviest rainfall in 30 years. \nBuyers are now looking to import from the US and Egypt, but the added distance makes the produce more pricey.

However, other businesses are experiencing shortages and we have seen some bulk buying in our stores. \nâ€˜We have therefore had a cap on sales of broccoli and iceberg lettuce to ensure we maintain good supplies for our regular customers. \nâ€˜As you can imagine, most customers donâ€™t buy more than three broccoli at a time.â€™ \nA Sainsburyâ€™s spokesperson said: â€˜Severe weather has affected crops, but we are working with our suppliers to maintain supply for our customers.â€™ \nAs broccoli becomes the next victim of 2017â€™s veg crisis, people on Twitter canâ€™t contain their frustration (sort of).
