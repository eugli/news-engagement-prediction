Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/828343072840900610 \nTrump’s attack on U.S. District Court Judge James Robart enters its second day, as an appeals court denies a request from the Trump administration to immediately reinstate the president’s executive order barring visa applicants from seven countries. \nRobart had two days before issued a temporary restraining order suspending the travel ban in response to a lawsuit arguing it is unconstitutional because it amounts to religious discrimination. \nDemocrats express dismay at Trump’s comments, saying they suggest the president doesn’t respect the independence of the judiciary. \nMore coverage https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827865957750161408 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827867311054974976 \nTrump targets U.S. District Court Judge James Robart, who hours before had issued a temporary restraining order suspending the enforcement of Trump’s executive order barring visa applicants from seven countries. \nRobart’s ruling, effective nationwide, comes in response to a lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota. The suit argues that the executive order amounts to religious discrimination against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution. \nThe White House says it will appeal Robart’s order , and also seeks an emergency stay against it. In the meantime, the Department of Homeland Security suspends “any and all actions” related to the travel ban. \nTrump’s tweets, particularly his use of the term “so-called judge,” spark a barrage of responses . \nFar from a liberal reformer, Robart was appointed by George W. Bush and is known for his conservative legal views . Friends say he’s unlikely to be swayed by Trump’s comments. \nMore coverage https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/828024835670413312 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/828042506851934209 \nTrump continues his attack on U.S. District Court Judge James Robart, who had issued a temporary restraining order suspending the enforcement of Trump’s executive order barring visa applicants from seven countries. \nThe president again uses the word “ban,” four days after the White House insists the term “misrepresents” Trump’s executive order and demands that reporters stop using it. \nMore coverage Story So Far: What you need to know about the fight against Trump's travel ban https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/828039143318024194 \nIn the interview, Trump calls California “out of control” and threatens to withhold federal funding to the state if it votes to declare itself a sanctuary state. \nMore coverage Feb. 3 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827477947154063361 \nIt’s another shot fired in a war of words between Trump and the former governor of California, who replaced Trump as host of “The Apprentice” after Trump won the presidency. \nAt an appearance the day before at the National Prayer Breakfast , Trump had requested prayers for Schwarzenegger, calling his takeover of the reality television show “a total disaster” and saying that “the ratings went down the tubes.” In response, Schwarzenegger took to Twitter and suggested that he and Trump switch jobs . \nMore coverage Schwarzenegger: ‘We’re going through some difficult moments ... but I guarantee we will work our way out of this’ https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827478751931924480 \nLater in the day, the Trump administration imposes economic sanctions on Iran as punishment for the country’s ballistic missile test and its support for militant groups in regional conflicts. \nThe penalties, which target 25 Iranian companies and individuals, appear calibrated to increase pressure on Iran without jeopardizing the landmark nuclear deal negotiated under the Obama administration, or creating a new international crisis. \nAfter Trump’s election, Obama had warned of imposing new U.S. sanctions on Iran while it remains in compliance with the deal, saying that doing so would open a rift with the other major signatories — Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. \nMore coverage CIA chief warns Trump that scrapping Iran deal would be 'disastrous' https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827480386120929280 \nTrump thanks Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after Turnbull refutes a Washington Post report describing a phone call between the two leaders as a heated exchange. \nIn comments to Australian media, Turnbull denies that Trump hung up on him and characterizes their conversation as “courteous.” \nTurnbull also reportedly says that Trump has committed to honoring a deal for the U.S. to accept some 1,250 refugees from Australia’s offshore detention centers, even though Trump had taken to Twitter to ridicule the arrangement two days before. \nMore coverage Australia doesn’t want them.

School officials blamed the violence on “black block agitators,” self-described anarchists or antifascists who attach themselves to peaceful protests but are intent on causing damage, though there’s no evidence to suggest they are paid for their time. \nTrump’s tweet also comes as protests against his travel ban continue throughout the country. Those are largely peaceful and incident-free. \nIt’s not the first time Trump has blamed “professional” or “paid” protesters for demonstrations against his presidency. He made similar claims in response to a near-riot that prompted the cancellation of a rally along his campaign trail, as well as demonstrations that erupted nationwide after his election. The theory that powerful leftists were conspiring to disrupt Trump’s inauguration by hiring professional agitators was also advanced by some conservative outlets, including Breitbart News, in the days leading up to the ceremony. \nMore coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:13:51.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
