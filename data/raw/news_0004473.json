but has permitted its partial release, allowing the opening scenes of the episode to be viewed by the public for the first time.\nThe newly-released video clips do not show the shooting incident itself, only some of the events leading up to it.\nThe footage begins in a grassy field shortly after two insurgents had been spotted creeping up on a remote British outpost in Helmand Province.\nAn Apache was summoned from Camp Bastion to counter their stealth attack, and Sgt Blackman’s patrol was sent out too.\nThe aircrew spotted one of the gunmen in a cornfield.\nAs the Marines watch, several bursts of loud gunfire can be heard as the Apache unleashes 139 rounds from its 30mm cannon.\nThe newly-released video clips do not show the shooting incident itself, but shots can be heard in the background as the Marine patrol searches for the insurgents\nSoldiers are heard shouting 'shoot the c***' and 'they've f missed', referring to an Apache helicopter firing on the insurgents\nThe Marines, positioned some distance away, can be heard shouting ‘Come on!’ and ‘I think he’s dead’.\nAs might be expected of young troops in a dangerous battlefield, their language is course as they are heard discussing the Apache crew’s aim.\nA voice says: ‘They’ve missed him. They’ve f***ing missed the cheeser.’\nThe Marines accuse the Apache crew of ‘error after error after error’ and suggest they should have fired a Hellfire rocket instead.\nThe next clip from the blisteringly hot afternoon in September 2011 shows Sgt Blackman and Jack Hammond, known as Marine C, walking over to examine the wounded man.\nThey found an AK47, spare ammunition and a hand grenade lying by his blood-soaked body in the 50C heat. The insurgent cannot be seen.\nThe rest of the episode including the shooting will not be shown publicly, but the story of what happened next is well known.\nOther footage shows the patrol moving through a field and holding their positions as they search for the Taliban fighters\nSgt Blackman led his patrol into the cornfield where they found an AK47, spare ammunition and a hand grenade by the insurgent's 'blood-soaked' body\nThe clips were released following a High Court application from media organisations including the BBC\nSgt Blackman shot the insurgent, famously quoting from Hamlet as he said: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil.’\nAfter Sgt Blackman’s court martial, three judges ruled that the video of the shooting incident should not be made public.\nAt the time, government terrorism experts had advised the judges that Sgt Blackman and his family could be at risk from Islamic extremists.\nPaul Mott, the deputy head of the government’s Research Information and Communications Unit, said at the time that the video was 'a gift in propaganda terms’.\nThe court martial’s Judge Advocate General, Jeff Blackett, ruled that the release of the video would ‘generate significant feelings of anger and revenge among certain people and will incite attacks on British service personnel at home and abroad’.\nThe application for the video to be partially released was made on behalf of the BBC, Sky News, ITN, and The Guardian and Times Newspapers.\nWedding day: Sgt Alexander Blackman with his wife Claire when they married in 2009 - but reunion hopes were dashed before Christmas after he was not granted bail\nProud: Claire Blackman was defiant and said that despite the disappointment that her husband won't be freed he still has the chance to appeal against his conviction this year\nThey want to use it to illustrate reports of Sgt Blackman’s appeal, which begins next week on Tuesday.\nHundreds of ex-Marines and other supporters are expected to travel to the Royal Courts of Justice in London in solidarity.\nThey will pack the public gallery of the Lord Chief Justice’s historic court number 4 where five of the most senior judges in the land will preside over Sgt Blackman’s fate.\nHe is serving life for the shooting. Thanks to generous Daily Mail readers who funded a new legal team, he won the right to the new appeal, which is expected to last three days.\nThe court will hear how three eminent psychiatrists now agree he was suffering from ‘combat stress disorder’ at the time he pulled the trigger.\nThe judges could commute his sentence from murder to manslaughter with diminished responsibility, or order a retrial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:37:10.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
