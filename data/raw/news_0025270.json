Pearson School Board Chair Suanne Stein Day.\nEyewitness Derek Defazio, who works at an auto body shop next to the collision site, told CBC News that the woman wasn't driving fast.\nDefazio said she appeared to lose control on a curve before hitting the bus.\nAfter witnessing the crash, Defazio tried to help her out of the car, but he said she was stuck and she wasn't breathing.\nTen minutes later, he said first responders arrived with the jaws of life.\nAll children except 1 released from hospital The bus was travelling on Route 201 in Saint-Clet, about 31 kilometres southwest of Montreal, when the car lost control, crossed into the oncoming lane and hit the bus, Stein Day said.\nOfficials said seven students were brought to hospital as a preventive measure. (Simon-Marc Charron/Radio-Canada)\nSeven children on the bus were taken to the Valleyfield hospital with injuries to their teeth, tongues and knees, according to Julien Sauriol, spokesman for the local ambulance workers (CETAM).\nAs of 1:45 p.m. all of the students except for one had been released from hospital. Day said the remaining child had been vomiting and might have a concussion.\nTwo students lived near the scene of the collision and were picked up by their parents, while the other two went to school, accompanied by a secretary, Stein Day said.\nThe bus driver was also taken to hospital with minor injuries. The Sûreté du Québec is handling the investigation.\nRoads were deemed safe, chair says All parents of students at the school were notified about the incident.\nThe principals of both branches of the school are at the hospital with the parents of the injured children, Stein Day said.\nA trauma team will also be made available should the children need psychological support.\nStein Day said around 4 a.m., the bus companies checked the roads and determined the weather wouldn't be a factor in getting children to school safely this morning.\n\"Accidents happen whether the roads are clear or not. We really don't know what caused this accident,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:31:38.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
