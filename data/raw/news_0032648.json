Alongside the charity venture, Iskra is currently collaborating with American Eagle's Aerie lingerie label for their 'REAL' campaign, which aims to encourage body positivity.

Natural beauty: Iskra swept her blonde locks into a slick ponytail to display her naturally stunning features - which she only enhanced with glowing make-up and a soft pink lip Having a ball: Iskra happily took selfies with Asia Monet Ray (L) backstage at the event - which advocates and spreads awareness of women's heart health with a charity fashion show The runway star can be seen modelling a lilac bralet - showcasing her toned tum before her rounded stomach as she changed angles for the revealing shot. The blonde beauty wrote encouragingly of the change: 'Your fat rolls are beautiful. I made a video about them (link in my bio) And the reason we have been lead to believe they aren't is because we don't see them in the media unless someone's being shamed for weight gain or ridiculed for their body. 'This is NOT the truth and not OK. Having rolls of skin / fat that are soft / squidgy or big / small does not define your beauty. I wanted to show you how my body looks when I'm relaxed and when I'm posing right next to each other so you can see how easy it is to manipulate how a body looks.'

'Which for a long time lead me to believe that's how I should look. 'Because even if I did happen to have a few shots where I'm in a position you can see back fat or rolls someone had decided it's more \"beautiful\" \"aspirational\" or will inspire more customers to buy the product if those so called \"flaws\" don't exist.'
