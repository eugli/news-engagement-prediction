He has four college degrees. And he recently donated $30 million to the Indiana University School of Medicine — the largest gift the school has ever received from an alumnus. \nBut Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, didn't seem very impressed by any of that on Thursday when Brown criticized legislation that threatened to effectively kick electric car maker Tesla out of Indiana . \n\"HB 1592 is nothing but an idiotic sop to the dealership association. Move into the 21st century. This stupid bill is bad for IN,\" Brown said in a Tweet as Soliday's committee took up his measure. \nSoliday later shot back : \"@DonBrownIndy not nearly as stupid as you are!!!!\" \nScreenshot of a Twitter exchange between Rep. Ed Soliday and CEO Don Brown. (Photo: Don Brown) \nBrown then defended his intelligence in a series of tweets. \n\"You earn three degrees in a state, start two public companies, fund a new research center at the med school, and get a puerile response,\" he said in one. You earn three degrees in a state, start two public companies, fund a new research center at the med school, and get a puerile response. pic.twitter.com/U5dFDma6XP — Don Brown (@DonBrownIndy) February 3, 2017 \nCriticism of Soliday's response soon rained down on social media, even as the lawmaker worked out a compromise that grandfathered in Tesla. \nBy Friday, Soliday deactivitated his social media accounts. \nSoliday didn't respond to a phone call from IndyStar about the Twitter exchange, but a spokeswoman emailed a statement on his behalf. \n\"My comment to Don Brown on Twitter was not meant to be a personal insult,\" he said. \"It was a quick reaction and shouldn't have happened. It was made after I spent many hours and much effort to successfully strike a compromise with all stakeholders. His statement on House Bill 1592 seemed counterproductive to the great progress made on the legislation.\" \nBrown said he was surprised by the response — and the reaction it received on social media. \n\"I didn’t mean to stir up that much of a hornet's nest,\" he said. \"It’s just ridiculous to get that kind of infantile response from a state lawmaker. I’m not some kind of flame-throwing liberal. I’m a conservative business guy.\" \nBrown co-founded Software Artistry in the 1980s, which IBM later bought. He then started Interactive Intelligence, which was sold to Genesys for $1.4 billion last year. He is now CEO of a new medical startup, LifeOmic Inc. \nIn December, he gave $30 million to the IU School of Medicine to boost research into immunotherapies, treatments that enlist a patient’s immune system in the quest for a cure for cancers and other diseases. \nHe said he saw the legislation as stifling innovation in an effort to protect car dealers. \nSoliday and other supporters argued that they were simply trying to protect car buyers by banning car makers from selling directly to customers rather than through dealerships with service centers. After recessing Thursday's committee meeting, Soliday introduced an amendment to the legislation that exempted automakers already selling directly to customers, while outlawing any companies that might want to do so in the future. \nThat compromise satisfied Tesla. \n“Tesla applauds Chairman Ed Soliday and the members of the Roads and Transportation Committee for amending this legislation to allow Tesla to continue investing and growing in the Hoosier state,\" the company said in a statement. \nSoliday is just the latest lawmaker to set off controversy on social media. \nTwo other Republicans — Rep. Jim Lucas and Sen. Jack Sandlin — removed social media posts this past week that were widely criticized for disparaging women. \nA Facebook post shared on Sandlin's account called the participants in recent women's marches “fat women out walking.” He later said he did not believe he shared the post. \nLucas apologized for a Facebook post he shared that showed a police officer in riot gear pepper spraying a woman in the face, with the caption: “Participation trophies, now in liquid form.” \nSpeaking to reporters about those posts, House Speaker Brian Bosma said he had to provide his members with a Social Media 101 class. The first lesson, he said: \"You're not Donald Trump.\" \nCall IndyStar reporter Tony Cook at (317) 444-6081. Follow him on Twitter: @indystartony .
