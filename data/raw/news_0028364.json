Twitter Courtesy of Mark Coffey/ABC. It took over 30 combined seasons of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette , but ABC’s reality romance juggernaut has finally , reportedly cast a black lead. The Hollywood Reporter broke the news on Monday, alleging that the identity of next seasons’s Bachelorette will be announced on Jimmy Kimmel Live! tonight. According to the report, audiences of The Bachelor are already acquainted with the lucky woman— Rachel Lindsay , a lawyer from Texas who is “competing” on the current season of The Bachelor . Franchise host Chris Harrison has already reacted to reports, telling Us Weekly that Lindsay “would be incredible.” He continued, “She’s incredibly smart, she’s sweet and caring yet strong and independent, obviously wicked smart and a lawyer and very accomplished, has a lot of attributes.” The casting comes after the franchise endured years of criticism for its lack of diversity. In a notable dig, the Lifetime series UnREAL even cast a black lead before the reality series it parodies did. The Bachelor has recently made some attempts at fixing its diversity problem, including featuring the most diverse cast yet on the current season, with eight out of 30 nonwhite contestants. Although franchise creator Mike Fleiss has not directly commented on the report, he did use Twitter to hint it might be correct.
