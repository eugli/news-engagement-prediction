Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP Image 14 of 14 DeVos ekes out confirmation win as Pence casts historic vote 1 / 14 Back to Gallery President Donald Trump accused Democrats of seeking to torpedo education progress. In a tweet before the vote, he wrote, \"Betsy DeVos is a reformer, and she is going to be a great Education Sec. for our kids!\" Pence tweeted later in the day that supporting DeVos was \"a vote for every child having a chance at a world-class education.\" She now takes the helm of a department charged with implementing laws affecting the nation's public schools with no direct experience with traditional public schools. Her opponents noted that she has no experience running public schools, nor has she attended one or sent her children to one She also will have to address several hot-button issues in higher education, such as rising tuition costs, growing student debt and the troubled for-profit colleges, many of which have closed down, leaving students with huge loans and without a good education or job prospects. Close attention also will be paid to how DeVos deals with sexual assault and freedom of speech on campuses. Ahead of Tuesday's vote, emotions ran high as constituents jammed senators' phone lines. Protesters gathered outside the Capitol, including one person in a grizzly bear costume to ridicule DeVos. Democrats and labor unions vigorously fought the nomination, suggesting that DeVos would defund traditional public schools by diverting taxpayers' money to charter and private institutions. They cited her financial interest in organizations pushing for charter schools, though she has said she will divest those interests. Collins and Murkowski said they feared her focus on charter schools will undermine remote public schools in their states. \"President Trump's swamp got a new billionaire today,\" the Democratic National Committee said in a statement. \"Millions of teachers, parents and students could not have made their opposition to Betsy DeVos' confirmation any clearer — they do not want someone whose only education experience is dismantling public schools.\" DeVos supporters, however, saw her confirmation as an occasion to breathe new life into a troubled American school system and a chance to shift power from Washington to the local level. \"She has been a leader in the movement for public charter schools — the most successful reform of public education during the last 30 years,\" said Sen. Lamar Alexander , the chairman of the Education Committee . \"And she has worked tirelessly to help low-income children have more choices of better schools.\" DeVos has her work cut out. \"She will have to make it a priority to reach out to educators and education policy makers to reassure them that she is committed to working to improve education for all students including the vast majority who attend and will continue to attend traditional public schools,\" said Martin West , associate professor of education at Harvard University . \"My view is that she is committed to doing that.\" In addition to DeVos, Republicans hope to confirm a series of other divisive nominees this week: Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general, GOP Rep. Tom Price of Georgia as health secretary and financier Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary.
