On Sunday he hinted he would break with Westminster convention and be “ lenient ” on those who had opposed him and let them keep their jobs. \nTulip Siddiq, the first member of Corbyn’s team to quit over the three-line whip, was surprised by the apparent lax attitude to discipline. \nShe told the The Huffington Post: “It should have been a free vote. What’s the point of having a three line whip if the consequences are not enforced?” \nLewis, who is often spoken of as a future Labour leadership candidate, said the problem for his party was that while 67% of Labour voters voted ‘Remain’, 75% of its MPs are in ‘Leave’ constituencies. \n“There are swathes of this country, like in Stoke, where we are hanging on by the fingernails to keep Ukip at bay,” he said. “If Ukip make a breakthrough in Stoke, if they make a breakthrough in parts of the county in the north - there will be a rout.” “Once they have one voice they will have a base and it will be a domino effect. I do not want the politics of Trump in Westminster.” Lewis campaigned for ‘Remain’ and his constituency also voted to stay in the EU. However he told the meeting it was wrong to brand all ‘Leave’ voters as “just a bunch of ignorant racists”. “We are deeply deeply divided country, in terms of income, in terms of geography, in terms of culture,” he said. “I kind of the thought the issue of Europe was some crackpot thing. Oh how wrong we were.” \nThe European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, which will give Theresa May the right to trigger ARticle 50 and take the UK out of the EU, returns to the Commons for three more days of debate today. \nIt will be a chance for MPs to amend the legislation after last week’s second reading vote on the principle of the Bill. The Government has sought to restrict the opportunities for change by limiting it to just two clauses. Speaker John Bercow will decide which of the scores of amendments MPs will have a chance to vote on.
