The duo to say the least was a riot in one of the most entertaining episodes of KWK 's fifth season and was exceptionally chatty as they took the show by storm. \nWhile KJo sang praises for the \"hatke\" actress Kangana the episode began with him applauding the \"hatke dukan\" of Kangana and asked her to bear with the \"unapologetic frivolities\" of the show's format. Kangana credited her success to KJo's rejection and derision, the filmmaker constantly tried to make it up to her for underestimating her ability as an actress. \nSaif Ali Khan, on the other hand, was pleasant throughout and being a charmer as he was a delight. The actor, however, confessed that he is nervous on the sets and confident otherwise. \nAfter two serious sessions with the guests, the host moved on to a raunchier segment Koffee shots with Karan, which was all dedicated to sex. The situational round had Saif and Kangana saying a yes or no by drinking or not drinking the coffee shots. \nAs interesting as it sounds, the section was a revelation. With Saif's confession of cheating on his partner a long while back and Kangana opening up on her lesbian encounter, the coffee shots were hilarious, to say the least. \nThe much-hyped rapid fire round during the episode was one helluva ride. While both Saif and Kangana gave a tough competition to each other, the coffee hamper went to the 29-year-old. In an attempt to form a new relationship, KJo was all the more happy to congratulate Kangana on her KWK victory. \nAs the episode neared its end, Shahid Kapoor turned up to accompany his Rangoon stars on the Koffee couch. Talking about his \"simple\" relationship with Saif and a \"complicated\" equation with Kangana, the 35-year-old definitely spilled some beans on his reported cold war with the female lead in the historical drama.
