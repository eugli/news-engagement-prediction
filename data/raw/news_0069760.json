While the U Ultra is a top-tier phone with top-tier specs, the U Play is what you can call a humbler offering from the company in question, something on the lines of an HTC Desire. The U Ultra and U Play belong to the first wave of U-smartphones from HTC that represent a new phase in the company's roadmap. Here's a point-by-point breakdown of the HTC U Ultra and the U Play: Specifications: \nProcessor: The HTC U Ultra is powered by Qualcomm's top-tier Snapdragon 821 processor (quad-core clocked at 2.15GHz) clubbed with Adreno 530 GPU. The HTC U Play is, meanwhile, powered by a Mediatek Helio P10 processor (octa-core clocked at 2GHz) clubbed with Mali-T860MP2 GPU. \nRAM: Both the phones come with 4GB of RAM. \nInternal storage: Both the HTC U Ultra and the U Play come with 64GB of internal memory which is further expandable by up to 2TB via a microSD card slot. \nScreen: The HTC U Ultra is a 5.7-inch phone while the U Play maxes out at 5.2-inch. The U Ultra has a 2K Super LCD 5 screen while its secondary display has a 160x1040 resolution. It also gets Corning's new Gorilla Glass 5. The U play, on the other hand, has a 1080p screen with an older-gen Corning Gorilla Glass up top. \nRear camera: The U Ultra sports a 12-megapixel (UltraPixel) rear camera with f/1.8 aperture, OIS, PDAF and a dual-tone flash. The U Play, meanwhile, sports a 16-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, OIS, PDAF and a dual-tone flash. The U Ultra can do 4K videos, while the U Play maxes out at 1080p. \nFront camera: Both the phones come with a 16-megapixel front-facing camera. \nSoftware: While the U Ultra comes with Android Nougat, the U Play runs Android Marshmallow-based Sense UI. \nBattery: While the U Ultra is backed by a 3,000mAh battery with support for Quick Charge 3.0, the U Play is backed by a smaller 2,500mAh battery with support for 5V/2A charging. Special features: \n-- Both the phones, come with HTC's Sense Companion AI which \"isn't only about machine learning, but also an extension of you, the user,\" according to the company. \n-- The Sense Companion \"can suggest that you dress warmer and leave a little earlier for work if snow is forecast; remind you to take a power bank on longer trips; and even recommend a restaurant when you're away for the weekend and then book seats for you2. Best of all, it's made to evolve and get to know you better over time,\" HTC adds. The company, however, notes that the \"feature will be available for download in early 2017 (via a system update) and may not be pre-installed on the U Ultra and the U Play.\" \n-- To make the phones more AI-friendly, HTC has incorporated four always-on low-power microphones inside them, so they can respond to every command. The U Ultra and the U Play also come with a one-of-its-kind biometric voice unlock and control mechanism so users can securely unlock their phone without even interacting with it. -- The U Ultra, in addition, also comes with a secondary ticker display above the main screen that is a window to the Sense Companion, according to the company. It is capable of prioritising your top contacts, app shortcuts, event notifications and more, that are then delivered to you in a discreet manner without lighting the screen and also the technology inside learns (and evolves) with time, claims HTC. \n-- The U line-up also comes with a new design. HTC calls it the liquid design and it essentially consists of glass and metal that boasts of an all-around symmetrical bending that reflects light differently when viewed at different angles. \n-- The U Ultra and the U Play also come with sonar-based audio system -- called U-Sonic -- over headphones that is claimed to deliver true sound that is also capable of adapting to the user. Both the phones come without a regular 3.5mm audio jack and have a single USB Type-C out for charging, data syncing and high-res audio. HTC U Sonic, however, works only with compatible USB-C headphones. The U Ultra, in addition, also supports BoomSound Hi-Fi sound technology.
