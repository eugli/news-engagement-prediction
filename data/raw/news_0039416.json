So you nap when you can, switch the alarm to snooze mode and skip nights out to go to bed ever-earlier in your attempts to catch up on lost sleep. The key to putting an end to this destructive pattern is simple. You need to shorten the amount of time you spend in bed. It may sound counter-intuitive, but trust me on this. The idea behind so-called sleep rescheduling is that, by consolidating your sleep, you effectively concentrate and condense it to ‘thicken’ it and toughen up the vulnerability points. It makes the dips in the night that render you vulnerable to being woken by bad dreams, distant noises or nagging worries far fewer in number, and your sleep more intense and refreshing. It’s not easy — which is one reason why I’ve left it to last. (And if you’ve been following my plan and have already dramatically improved your sleep, then you don’t need to try it.) The aim is to achieve perfect sleep — the sort of sleep duration and quality that you might have enjoyed before insomnia blighted your life. I can’t tell you whether that will be six hours a night or eight. It’s a very personal issue, but I can help you find your perfect sleep duration, thanks to the personalised element of this plan. And that’s where the power of your sleep diary comes into its own. That’s another reason why we’ve left this very important step to the end. In order to truly personalise this part of the plan, I need you to have completed a week’s worth of diary entries. Do see your GP before embarking on sleep rescheduling if you have any health concerns or illnesses, and be aware, this sleep tool is not appropriate for people with bipolar disorder, psychosis or epilepsy, or if you have a history of seizures, post-traumatic stress disorder, migraine or head injury. I need to warn you now that this is going to involve going to bed later than you probably have done for years and, that because insomnia is conditioned, you might initially wake up during the night. This means you are likely to be even more tired during the day than normal — but just for a few days. I can assure you any discomfort will be short-lived, and your life could change irreversibly for the better. Think of it a bit like sleep training a baby — a few nights of discomfort and a few super-bleary days, but a potential lifetime of blissfully silent nights. This isn’t actually restricting your sleep, it is merely restricting the time you spend in bed. And there are very good scientific reasons why this is a good idea. Still not convinced? Ask yourself how long you’ve had insomnia. If you’ve been struggling with sleep for roughly three nights a week over the past two years, you’ll have had 312 nights blighted by insomnia. Are you willing to trade a few nights of re-ordered sleep now for 312 nights of insomnia in the future? With this in mind, it is a good idea to start this when you have a couple of days without commitments, or at the weekend — tonight! — so you have a couple of days without having to be properly focused for work. Start now and you can spend the weekend adjusting, but be one big step on the road to recovery by Monday. (Be aware that this is not a decision to take lightly, and you should take special care if you need to drive anywhere or operate machinery. If you do, take a moment to work out whether this is realistically manageable for the next seven days, and perhaps delay until you can take a few days off work to focus properly on your insomnia.) Calculate your new, later bedtime 1. Work out how much sleep you actually get each night. At the bottom of your morning diary entry, we have asked you to calculate your ‘total sleep time’ for the night (the total time you spent in bed, minus the total time you spent awake). Use a calculator and add together all the ‘total sleep time’ calculations you have, then divide this figure by the number of days you’ve kept your diary. Ideally, this should be at least seven continuous days. The result will give you an average total sleep time in minutes. This figure shows exactly how much time you are spending asleep each night. If your insomnia is bad, you might be shocked to see how little sleep you are getting. All the more reason for you to be doing this! If your average total sleep time works out at less than five hours (300 minutes), it’s a sign that you really are having a tough time. No matter how low your average total sleep time is, never try sleep rescheduling on less than five hours (300 minutes) per night. 2. Set a firm, unchangeable morning wake-up time. Think long-term: this will be the time you set your alarm and the time you get up for the foreseeable future — weekends and holidays included — because this is the best way to anchor the circadian rhythm, which controls when you wake and when you sleep. Most people set this as the time when they need to get up and get ready for work, or get the children ready for school. Even if you don’t work or you’re retired and have no morning commitments, it’s important to set a non-negotiable wake-up time that works best for you. 3. Work out your temporary new bedtime. To do this, take your total sleep time (the average of all your calculated sleep times) and count backwards in minutes from your new, set wake-up time. So, if you decide that, from now on, your morning alarm will go off at 7am and your sleep diary reveals you average six hours’ sleep per night (360 minutes), your new bedtime — for the period of this sleep rescheduling exercise — should be 1am. Do not, under any circumstances, factor less than five hours in bed. The sleep diary and your preferred wake-up time mean this is a completely individual calculation, but you are very likely to find that your new bedtime is a lot later than you imagined. Trust me here and stick with this. Any compromise now will significantly dilute the impact of this very powerful technique. 4. Stick to your new schedule, going to bed at your temporary new bedtime and getting up when your alarm goes off — with no deviation — for seven nights, and keep religiously filling in your sleep diary while you do so. I urge you not to buckle or even think about adjusting your new bedtime. Bringing it forward even by a few minutes will produce a watered-down effect. Remember, you’ve done the calculations and you know how much total sleep you get each night. Even if your new bedtime seems horribly late, you will still be getting exactly the same amount of sleep as you were before. However, it may take a few days for your body and brain to adjust to your new concentrated sleep regimen. In the first few days, if you still struggle to fall asleep, or you wake up in the night, you’ll find you have to function on a little less sleep even than normal. Keep yourself and others safe, and keep the faith. This is only short-lived. Studies have repeatedly shown that this method really does work. Very swiftly, your body and brain will be forced to accept that bed means sleep the minute your head hits the pillow. Just as important, your sleep will be deep and refreshing. Would you prefer six hours of really good quality sleep or eight hours of really poor quality sleep? 5. No napping, no compensating, no catching up at weekends. The only exception to this rule is if you feel so sleepy during the day that you absolutely need (as opposed to want) to sleep. This could be a sign of other health issues and you must see your GP before continuing. However, most people report that, at first, sleep rescheduling has very little impact on their overall levels of tiredness, since they’re getting exactly the same amount of sleep as they always did. Indeed, you should very soon start to feel better — fresher, more alive and optimistic — than you have for a very long time, because your sleep will be consistent, deep and good for the first time in years. Every night you get it right — falling asleep within minutes of going to bed, sleeping through the night and not waking up ahead of your alarm — you will be sending positive reinforcement messages to all the subconscious mechanisms that have been keeping you awake at night for so long without you realising. HOW TO TURN YOUR LATE NIGHTS INTO A TREAT Some sleep specialists recommend filling the hours until your new late bedtime by doing something calming, relaxing and/or quiet in a dimly lit and comfortable environment When you’re tired, it can be a tough call to stay awake until gone midnight each night. Some sleep specialists recommend filling the hours until your new late bedtime by doing something calming, relaxing and/or quiet in a dimly lit and comfortable environment. They suggest handwriting letters (no computers, remember), reading (books, not on a Kindle or eReader), listening to music, or knitting. As long as it’s not physically, psychologically or emotionally arousing, it ticks the box. But I like to take a more positive stance. I think it’s important that you don’t regard this as a kind of punishment and that you don’t tiptoe around yourself too much. You should avoid any chance of inadvertently sending a signal to your brain that your sleep is fragile and that you should be careful — neither of which would be good for your sleep resilience in the long-term. I prefer to give my patients free rein to do anything they like, with the following main exceptions: no work, food, exercise or computers/phones — and certainly no alcohol. You also shouldn’t spend it in bed. Snacks are OK, but no main meals or vigorous exercise (both of which can affect your ability to sleep later). The main hurdle is the ban on napping and dozing, which must be adhered to until your body and brain have adjusted. Even the shortest snooze will affect your sleep homeostat — the physiological systems that regulate your need to sleep — and weaken your drive to drop off at the right time. Your biggest enemy at this time is the sofa. So, whatever you do in your long evenings, NEVER recline on the sofa! In my experience, the sofa lovers are the ones who are most likely to fall asleep and who, therefore, find sleep rescheduling the toughest. Sit up straight on the edge of the sofa or armchair or, better still, sit on a hard dining-room chair. That’s why I recommend trying to find something enjoyable to do to fill your time, since this means there’s less of a chance that you’ll nod off. Why not start a novel you’ve always said you would read, or compile a list of all the movies you’ve always wanted to watch, but never had time for? This is a not a punishment, and not something to be endured — think of these seven evenings as a handy new opportunity to do a few interesting things with the extra time you have. Reluctant to take the plunge? Sleep rescheduling is tough and you may find that it’s something you feel you simply cannot, or are not prepared to, do alone. That’s OK — you might need to ask your GP to refer you to a specialist in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) to support you through this tricky process. Don’t give up on CBT-I. Without sleep rescheduling, you are not likely to see the full benefits of this course, but it might be something you can come back to at another time. Improve your sleep efficiency The most important aim of sleep rescheduling is to boost the quality of your sleep, and we’ve had to shorten your time in bed in order to get there. But once the penny has well and truly dropped in terms of the mechanisms by which your body and brain fall and stay asleep, it’s safe to start extending your time in bed, bringing your bedtime gradually forwards. In most cases, it takes at least seven days of strict sleep rescheduling to do the trick. So keep checking the ‘sleep efficiency’ score in your sleep diary. This is the measure of how much time you actually spend asleep compared with how much potentially wasted time you find yourself spending in bed. You may need a calculator to work it out. Take your total sleep time and divide it by the total amount of time you spent in bed (the number of minutes between the moment you got into bed at night and when you got out of bed in the morning). FIVE OF THE BEST SLEEP GADGETS 1. Boon Glo Nightlight £45.50, argos.co.uk If you don’t like going to bed in total darkness, this nightlight will help you get to sleep. Three multi-coloured balls glow and gradually dim, before switching off after 30 minutes. If you need to get up during the night, rather than turning on bright lights, the removable balls can be carried with you to light your way. 2. S+ by ResMed £99, amazon.co.uk THIS small unit sits on your bedside table and plays soothing sounds to help you fall asleep, matching the rhythm to the pace of your breathing and slowing down as you fall asleep. The clever device claims to detect your movement to measure sleep patterns and senses light, temperature, noise and breathing, tracking the duration of the different sleep cycles and measuring the number of times you wake up in the night. 3. Withings Aura £149.95, withings.com THIS high-tech device emits a soft light (red to send you to sleep; blue to wake you up) and soothing sounds to help you sleep. It works with a slim mattress pad (£189.99 for the Total Sleep System, johnlewis.com) to track heart and respiratory rate, movement and even your different phases of deep and light sleep. If you like, a gentle morning alarm will wake you during a light period of sleep to avoid the shock of being pulled out of a deeper phase. 4. Lumie Bodyclock Iris 500 £160, lumie.com With a built-in aromatherapy function, this lovely lamp emits relaxing essential oils in vapour form to help you unwind at bedtime, and wake feeling refreshed. Fill the separate chambers with fragrances tailored towards either sunset or sunrise. The light also adjusts throughout the night to keep your sleep cycle on track by emulating a fading and rising sun. 5. Sense Sleep Monitor £149, hello.is This sleek tracker comes with a handy ‘Sleep Pill’ to clip on to your pillow. It monitors your sleep quality and changes in your bedroom — such as temperature, air, humidity, light and noise. These results are then reflected in the changing light, which glows different colours. It also plays relaxing sounds to help you get to sleep. Then multiply this figure by 100 to get a percentage score. Many people with insomnia find their score is around 60-70 per cent, which indicates they are spending 60-70 per cent of their night asleep in bed. That’s super-inefficient. Your aim, by working through my plan all this week, has been to nudge your score up to get it closer to an 85 per cent ideal. If your sleep efficiency score after a week of sleep rescheduling is at 85-90 per cent, keep your bed and wake time constant for another week. This has to be a slow process in order to maintain sleep consistency, and to avoid tipping the balance in the wrong direction and inadvertently allowing yourself too much time in bed again. If your score is still below 85 per cent after the first week, you should consider taking 15 minutes off your total sleep time and going to bed 15 minutes later than before, in order to condense your sleep time even further and encourage the concentrated sleep that defies night-time wakening. But remember not to go below five hours. Only move things by 15 minutes per week, keep to your set wake time and continue your sleep diary every day. Remember, your wake-up time is anchored and should not change unless absolutely necessary. If you sleep solidly and consistently for the next seven nights, then you are ready to start pushing your bedtime forwards again. Bring your bedtime forwards by 15 minutes — one 15-minute adjustment every week. Eventually, you will hit upon your new cut-off point — the set bedtime you can stick to long-term, which will pretty much guarantee a great night’s sleep every time. You know you’ve reached the finish line when you have a sleep efficiency score of 85-90 per cent and consistently feel refreshed in the daytime. This process cannot be rushed, or you risk wiping out all your hard work in the first week of sleep rescheduling. If, at any point, your average sleep efficiency over seven nights starts to dip, or busts the 90 per cent optimum, you could have gone too far. A score higher than 90 per cent indicates very little time awake, which could hint at sleep deprivation. (If you’re a parent, you’ll know that a child is sleep deprived if they fall asleep within seconds of their head hitting the pillow, or even while brushing their teeth! It’s the same principle.) If this happens, just add 15 minutes to your sleep time to see if your sleep efficiency re-settles. Bear in mind that the over-60s or those with illness or who are on regular medication might need to settle for closer to 80-85 per cent to account for the fact that age and medication can cause you to naturally spend short periods of the night awake. Even good sleepers, let alone ‘normal’ sleepers, still take a little time to fall asleep at night — some nights more than others. And many people who’ve never experienced insomnia may, on occasion, spend a small amount of time awake during the night. As you play with restricting your time in bed, it’s very important to keep a constant eye on the five-hour minimum rule. Less than five hours sleep per night is not good for your health, so no matter what your sleep efficiency score, you should never have less than five hours in bed. Sleep well in the long-term Congratulations! You’ve come to the end of my sleep plan and you should now be on the road to enjoying great restorative sleep. But if insomnia has been your norm for many years, you’re likely to be a little nervous that it might return. Please don’t treat your sleep as fragile and worry that, if you stop working with my techniques, your insomnia will come back. That rarely happens. The more you worry about wrapping yourself up in cotton wool, the more likely you’ll for ever be anxious about sleep — never a good recipe for sleeping well. You can work to protect your new-found sleep security by teaching yourself a bit of what we call positive reinforcement. In your insomnia days, you might have involuntarily linked certain behaviours with poor sleep. Simply brushing your teeth, for instance, might have triggered stress as your body anticipated the sleepless night ahead. But now you have control of your insomnia, you can use the same unconscious mechanisms to work in your favour by associating certain habits with good sleep and, thereby, reinforcing your chances of good sleep when you repeat them. When you’ve been sleeping well for a number of weeks, try introducing something new into your sleep routine — such as a certain book, or the application of a delicious aromatherapy oil to your pillow. Each great night of sleep then becomes unconsciously ‘paired’ with that trigger, action or smell. Repeating the pairing will, over time, ‘condition’ that response, strengthening the association between the two. Eventually, with enough pairings, the stimulus will automatically generate the conditioned response. So, if you find yourself having a poor night of sleep, you can pick up that special book, or use a drop of that essential oil, and may find it induces sleepiness. As you move forward into a life without insomnia, it’s a good idea to be alert for risks and apply a little early management to ensure any new sleep disturbance passes as quickly as it came, without ever having the chance to develop into acute or chronic insomnia. Jet lag is a classic example. If you are travelling long-distance across time zones, the key is to alter your schedule a day or two before you travel by aligning light, food and exercise to your destination time. If you are travelling to the U.S., for example, start nudging mealtimes and exercise times closer to U.S. time. At other times, if you find a newly stressful event in your life starts to keep you awake at night, it is important that you do nothing. No naps, no lie-ins, no switching to the spare bedroom. Have faith that this will pass. Insomnia can only properly take hold when we start thinking and acting in different ways to try to compensate for our lack of sleep. You can protect your sleep long into the future by following these rules: 1. Always stick to a set bedtime The odd late-night or lie-in won’t open the insomnia floodgates, but stick to a small (30-60 minute) deviation from your set bedtime and your alarm call, and don’t deviate for more than two days in any week. Even if you have a bad night, do not attempt to compensate with a nap or a lie-in. Also keep your wake-up time the same — every day, irrespective of how much sleep you got the night before. If tiredness makes a small nap unavoidable in the daytime, or you find yourself extending your time in bed (at either end), make sure you pay that time back. So if you go to bed an hour earlier than normal, push your bedtime back by an hour the following night. 2. Clean up your sleep hygiene Good sleep hygiene is important whether you’re a good, normal or poor sleeper, so stay with the darkened bedroom, the quiet evening wind-downs, not too much caffeine or alcohol, and keep the pets off the bed. 3. Keep the bed for sleeping Stick to no computers, TV, eating or phones in bed. Just sleep and sex — and no napping during the day. 4. Time to bring back books Once things have settled, and your sleep efficiency is stable and good, you can start to incorporate some of the fun things you enjoyed back into your bedroom — such as books. But never electronics, work, food, exercise or pets. We would like to know the impact of the Daily Mail’s serialisation on your sleep. Please send us copies of your completed sleep diary.

Yoga, your secret sleep weapon Anecdotally, people have reported longer and better quality sleep, plus feeling refreshed on waking, after trying yoga even for only a short time There’s no doubt that yoga is a gentle way to wind down your day. And, although there isn’t enough reliable data to confirm a really strong link between the practice of yoga and the easing of insomnia, it is an avenue worth investigating. Anecdotally, people have reported longer and better quality sleep, plus feeling refreshed on waking, after trying yoga even for only a short time. Specifically, Kundalini yoga, which is very gentle and puts more emphasis on meditation and breathing rather than the physical exertion, strength or flexibility. Professor Ellis says: ‘We’re not really sure how it works, but our best guess is that yoga is especially effective because it relaxes both the body and the mind — it’s a two-in-one hit that reduces the stress levels so commonly associated with insomnia.’ If you do it right, you combine physical exercises with breathing techniques and meditation. In one study by researchers at Harvard Medical School, people with insomnia were taught basic yoga breathing, meditation and mantra (chanting) exercises in just one session. They were then asked to practise yoga every night before bed for eight weeks, and keep a sleep diary throughout. Improvements in sleep efficiency were significant, and included greater total sleep time, falling asleep more quickly and waking up later in the morning. Another study, this time of post-menopausal women in Brazil, found that two yoga sessions per week could be linked to a reduction in symptoms and severity of insomnia, as well as lower stress levels and an enhanced sense of quality of life. So, it’s worth trying to find a reputable practitioner running a class near you. Alternatively, try making the following simple exercises part of your evening wind-down routine — you could even do them in bed. Bedtime twist Sit cross-legged on the bed and exhale deeply as you twist your body to the left and place your left hand on the bed behind you, looking over your left shoulder. Your right hand should just rest on your left knee. Breathe deeply for a few seconds, then return to the centre and repeat on the right side. Baby sleep Kneel on the bed with your knees apart, sitting on your heels if you can. Exhale deeply and roll yourself forwards, so your forehead is resting on the bed in front of you, with your arms extended. Hold the pose for a few seconds, breathing deeply. Put your feet up Sit on your bed, with your bottom six to 12 inches away from the wall or headboard. Lie back and lift your legs, so your feet are resting on the wall/headboard. Breathe deeply for a few seconds, feeling the stretch along the backs of your legs. Duvet hip opener Bring your legs down and lie back on the bed with your knees bent. Place the soles of your feet together, then let your knees open to form a frog leg shape. Rest your arms out to the sides and breathe deeply for a few seconds. Bed roll Still lying down, hug your knees to your chest, wrapping your arms around your shins. Now rock gently back and forth and side to side for a few seconds, breathing steadily. Roll back, straighten your arms and legs and drift off to sleep. Although many people swear by relaxation tapes as another way to unwind at the end of the day, Professor Ellis isn’t convinced. He says: ‘The ones that involve lots of spontaneous noises (such as rainforest sounds or whale song) could arguably provide distraction from your racing thoughts. ‘But they can also be counter-productive if you find yourself constantly waiting to hear what’s going to come next. ‘A repetitive noise would probably work best, if any sounds do.’ Mindfulness is an increasingly popular form of meditation, and is certainly worth considering, but wait until you have finished Professor Ellis’s plan before trying it. That’s because it takes a different approach, which may confuse you if you combine the two at the same time. Where the insomnia plan guides you to eradicate sleep-related thoughts, feelings and worries, mindfulness teaches you to work with these thoughts to put sleep and insomnia into perspective. AFTER 20 YEARS OF EXHAUSTION, I FINALLY FEEL ENERGISED Anita Whiting, 54, is a career coach. She lives in Weybridge, Surrey, with husband Dean, 57, a sales director, and they have two grown-up children Anita Whiting, 54, is a career coach. She lives in Weybridge, Surrey, with husband Dean, 57, a sales director, and they have two grown-up children. Anita says: There is no rhyme or reason to my sleep problems. They started long before my menopause but, sometimes, I wonder if the trigger was having children. When they were babies, I would be up seven or eight times in the night — and I don’t think I’ve slept the same since. From 2009 until 2012, I had a high-pressure job. I’d come in exhausted at 8pm, then be replying to emails until 4am and only get three hours’ sleep. I’m sure that exacerbated the problem, and menopause might have made it worse. A good night for me is seven hours of uninterrupted sleep, which I haven’t had in years. Sometimes, I go to bed exhausted. But then I lie there and sleep evades me until the small hours. My husband also talks in his sleep at times, which doesn’t help. A normal night is going to bed, then waking up and drifting off about five times. On a bad night, I fall asleep quickly, but wake again three hours later and that’s it — no more sleep. I never drink caffeine after 8.30am and avoid chocolate in the evening. I’ve tried writing down my worries and had sleeping tablets from the doctor, but I’m reluctant to take these, as I know how addictive they can be. I’ve tried herbal medicines and even alcohol to get me to sleep, though too much makes it worse. I sometimes think: ‘I’m not getting any sleep, so I may as well get up and do something.’ I’ve been known to get up in the night and prepare coursework and even designed a website in the early hours. But, since starting the sleep diary, I have had a run of decent sleep. Maybe seeing it all written down in black and white has made my brain learn something subconsciously. Working out the percentage of sleep I was getting was a shock — one night, it was 25 per cent. Other tips I’ve picked up from Professor Ellis are to get rid of my phone from the bedroom. I’d already got rid of the TV in there, but before, as I lay awake, I often checked emails. Now, I leave my phone in the office. I’ve also started going to bed at the same time every night and setting my alarm for the same time every morning. I used to go to bed early — 8.30pm some nights — but would be awake from 10pm. I now go to bed religiously at 10pm and set the alarm for 7am. I’ve also bought new, firmer pillows and a mattress topper to see if they help. I’ll definitely continue with the diary. I want to beat this naturally. It’s unlikely to be a quick fix, either: in studies where mindfulness was shown to cure insomnia, it required six to eight sessions and a half-day workshop. Its main idea is to be completely non-judgmental. Try to stop automatically thinking of being awake at night or sleepy during the day as negative things. Try neither to sleep, nor to stay awake, but instead, just accept your state of being as it is; notice any feelings you might have and move on. Mindfulness also encourages you to have a ‘beginner’s mind’, where you treat each night as a single entity, or a one-off, whether it’s good or bad, and to discard any thoughts about how it compares to previous nights or how you’re going to feel the next day. You are also supposed to trust your body and mind, and accept that they are not deliberately trying to destroy you, but will naturally regulate both your sleep and daytime needs if you let them. Even after a prolonged period of sleep deprivation, it takes a relatively short time for the body to recover and for sleep to go back to ‘normal’. The idea here is that your body and mind have the capacity to self-regulate and correct sleep loss, and you need to ultimately trust that they will do their job.
