But it's not. It's in fact, a modern-day romantic fantasy,\" Ayan told reporters here.\nThe filmmaker also revealed that he will be shooting the movie in August, once Ranbir is done working on Sanjay Dutt biopic.\n\"Ranbir won't do this film and Dutt simultaneously. He has already begun shooting for Dutt and it should be done by August. That's when I will start with him and Alia Bhatt.\" Ayan was speaking at the premiere of Oscar-nominated film, \"Lion\".\nAt the event, the filmmaker was also asked for his reaction to the attack on director Sanjay Leela Bhansali allegedly by members of Karni Sena, who have a problem with the film's script. Ayan said that as someone who looks up to Bhansali, the incident came as a rude shock.\n\"As a young filmmaker and someone, who really respects Sanjay Bhansali, I feel it's sad and shocking. It shouldn't have happened. It was really unfortunate.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:49:49.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
