Sivarasa, he said he was appointed as a deputy principal private secretary to then prime minister Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi in 2003 but he resigned about a year later.\nTo another question by Sivarasa, Khairy said he did not attend Anwar’s sodomy trial but had read its judgments and media reports.\nHe said an event was organised in Kelana Jaya, Selangor, merely to explain the court decision on Sod­omy II case and rebut criticisms by political foes that Anwar’s sodomy charge was a political conspiracy.\n\"We thought it was important to explain its context, dispute the political conspiracy and that this was not about revenge,\" Khairy told the packed courtroom.\nLater, Anwar testified that Khairy had malicious intent in giving the speech defaming him that day.\nKhairy had used sexual connotations to imply there was misconduct on his part, he said.\nThe hearing before Justice Azizul Azmi Adnan will continue on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:13:22.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
