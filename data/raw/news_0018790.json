McDermott opened up on the rise of Starc. (Getty Images) CHENNAI: Even though Australia have picked four spinners in the squad for the upcoming tour of India, former Australia pacer and bowling coach Craig McDermott believes it will be the pace combination of Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood who will play a major role in tackling Virat Kohli and Co during the four-Test series. In an exclusive interview with TOI, the 51-year-old opened up on the rise of left-arm pacer Starc, on Aussie spinners and tactics for Indian batsmen. Excerpts... Which Australian bowler do you think could trouble Virat Kohli & Co? I can't pick one. I think pacers Starc and Hazlewood will play a major role. Both of them are forming a good bowling partnership. Starc is a complete bowler now. He can bowl on flat wickets. He has got great reverse swinging abilities, particularly around the wicket, and has tremendous stamina. While Hazlewood reverses the ball back in, Starc can move it both ways. I'm looking forward to them performing well in India. But I think it's going to come down to whether Australia can get enough runs on the board. What will be the ideal plan for Australian pacers to tackle the Indian batsmen? If you are bowling fast, then you bowl good lines and be patient. Both Starc and Hazlewood are patient and they should make sure they get their lengths right. If the wickets offer bounce, then they should use their pace to stick it up to the batsman's nose. It will be difficult in those conditions. Australia have picked four spinners in their squad. How do you see them faring in India? Nathan Lyon is experienced while the other spinners are all young and they haven't had a lot of exposure. They shouldn't allow the batsmen to step back deep in the crease and cut or play square of the wicket. You have got to make the batsman play down the wicket using their feet, so that they get caught or stumped. Whatever it may be, you have to be more precise and not let the batsman dictate you. There is a general feeling that Australian spinners are under pressure ahead of any Indian tour. One bad tour could see their exit from the team. How tough it is mentally for a young Australian spinner to tour India? They should accept and handle the expectations of the team and the Australian public that they (as spinners) must take wickets in India. They shouldn't be frightened by those expectations. Everybody knows, if you don't play well, then you get dropped. There is no point in worrying about that, you just have to get down and do your job properly. What is the one mistake that teams from Down Under have been doing in India in the past which they need to rectify? I think they need Matthew Hayden to teach them how to sweep. I was just joking! On a serious note, our batsmen failed to get runs in India in the last couple of series. Our top six didn't get runs; Starc, Siddle and Pattison got runs in that trip. Our top six have to stand up and make the bulk of the runs and give our bowlers something to bowl at. Kevin Pietersen recently said: \"You don't need to be on a spinning wicket to play spin properly or practice spin, you can be on any type of wicket.\" Australia at the moment are training in Dubai. What's your take on KP's statement? I think everybody has got their own opinion on how they should train for certain aspects. But I think when you are coming at the back of an Australian summer, it's handy to have some time on wickets that are not like Australian pitches. As they play so much cricket these days, they don't have more lead up games. When I was playing in a tour of India, we would have three or four first-class games before the first Test. So we had time to acclimatize. I feel a week or 10 days in Dubai and one tour match is wise. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.
