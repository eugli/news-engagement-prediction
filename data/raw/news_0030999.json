Read more Chance the Rapper wins Best Rap Album at the Grammys \nOcean, Kanye West and Drake all sat out of the Grammys in a protest against a lack of diversity among its nominees - believing that the ceremony does not fairly represent black or younger artists. \nOcean didn't even bother submitting his 2016 albums - Endless and Blonde - for consideration, explaining: \"That institution certainly has nostalgic impotance. It just doesn't seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down.\" \nOf this year's nominees, Beyonce, Rihanna and Drake were the only artists of colour nominated for Album of the Year, Song of the Year or Record of the Year, and all of them were snubbed in favour of white artists.
