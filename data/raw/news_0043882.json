He plays with a relentless motor to him, does a nice job disengaging, showed a burst off the edge and is a naturally strong kid with a lot of physicality. You should expect to see his stock really soar this spring when colleges can see him up close and personal.\" \nFor the 6-foot-5, 250-pound two-way prospect, the victory is the latest example of his rise after picking up scholarship offers from Oregon,UCLA and USC in recent weeks. \n\"Oregon is a huge football tradition, so it's a big honor,\" he said. \"I'm getting to know the coaching staff over the next year and taking a couple of visits. So far, it's been really good. I've only met coach (Willie) Taggart once. He seemed like a really classy guy. He had an immediate first impression on me.\" \nNot long ago, Pac-12 offers seemed like a distant possibility, but Bynum's quick ascension has caught even him off guard. \n\"There's a big part of me that's excited,\" he said. \"Don't get me wrong, I'm really excited. I'm incredibly excited. UCLA was my first offer, and it took about a week-and-a-half to sink in. I was like, 'I don't have to pay for college now.' \" \nBut Bynum wasn't the only Oregon linemen who had a big weekend. \nBoth Lake Oswego's Dawson Jaramillo and Corvallis' Marco Brewer advanced to the Under Armour camp's OL/DL one-on-one finals, while Jaramillo was also named one of eight finalists (out of approximately 100) for an event that showcased the camps most athletic linemen. \nClearly, it was a banner weekend for the reputation of Oregon high school football.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:33:01.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
