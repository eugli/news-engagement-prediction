The host for the 2017 Academy Awards gets a few inspirational words from the voice of God, a.k.a. Morgan Freeman. The actor delivers quite the motivational speech, relaying that Kimmel has \"the opportunity to be the toast of town\" or the \"chance to bomb so fantastically everywhere he goes people would say, 'Look at Sucky Sucko, he had his shot and man, did he blow it in front of billions.'\" Let's go for the first option and hope that Kimmel puts on a show to remember.\n Kimmel was announced to host the 89th annual Academy Awards in December . The late-night TV personality has had ample experience emceeing awards ceremonies, after helming the Emmys broadcasts in 2016 and 2012, and the American Music Awards several times. Though he's a seasoned host, a pep talk from Morgan Freeman doesn't hurt.\nWatch the commercial below and catch the Oscars live on February 26 on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:09:33.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
