The client list of Trishneet includes companies like Reliance, CBI, Gujarat Police, Punjab Police, Avon Cycles and Amul. \nPresently, Trishneet is 23 and is the head of TAC Security which deals in cyber security. The guy is basically from Ludhiana and from childhood only, he was interested in computers a lot. Slowly, his interest became his obsession and then he started gathering information about hacking. He was totally hooked off from studies and left standard 8 in between. \nSource \nAfter his results of class 8, everybody laughed at him while his parents were very angry with Trishneet but he was not affected by it, as now he was absolutely clear about the goal of his life. He left the school to give all his time to follow his dreams and also got himself enrolled in a correspondence course. \nWhen he was just 22, he started TAC security and today his client list comprises of 50 of Fortune 500 organizations. He has also written three books – “Hacking With Smart Phones”, “Hacking TALK with Trishneet Arora” and “The Hacking Era”. \nSource: Google Images \nThis is definitely an amazing feat on the part of a boy who has not even completed schooling. His business has expanded so fast that he has set up offices in UK and Dubai and the turnover has reached to crores annually. \nThe story of Trishneet is surely inspirational and it also breaks the belief that regular studies are the only route to success. \nDo share your views with regard to the article in the comments section below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T13:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:29:17.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
