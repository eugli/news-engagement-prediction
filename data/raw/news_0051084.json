The song might sound upbeat and easygoing, but the lyrics send a powerful message about the dangers of complacency, which is scarily relevant today. When Perry dropped the single, along with an adorable lyric video of a hamster eating teeny tiny food, we were in.\n Now, she's teasing the full music video for the song and it looks very interesting. The setting is a creepy amusement park called Oblivia, with rides like \"The Wheel\" and \"The American Dream Drop.\" Basically, in case you missed the political undertones of the song, Perry is prepared to slap you in the face with them in the video.\nAdmission is \"free\" See you next Tuesday... #chainedtotherhythm\nA post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on Feb 17, 2017 at 7:26pm PST\nThe full video will be released Tuesday, and honestly, we can't wait.\nFrom: Marie Claire", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BQo0cHHD4vu/", "http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/music/news/a25494/katy-perry-new-chained-to-the-rhythm-music-video-teaser/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/8gsGhdZDC-0?start=0&enablejsapi=1&origin=http://www.harpersbazaar.com&autoplay=0"], "published": "2017-02-19T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:19:08.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
