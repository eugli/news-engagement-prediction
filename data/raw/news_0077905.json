PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Mon, Feb 27, 2017 GETTY Millions will have to work into their eighties \nDreams of easing themselves into old age by cutting their hours and topping up pay packets with their pension are a “mirage,” former pensions minister Sir Steve Webb warned last night. \nHe said about four million people have been wooed into a false sense of security because they have been automatically enrolled into their employers’ pension scheme and save only the minimum eight per cent set by the Government.
