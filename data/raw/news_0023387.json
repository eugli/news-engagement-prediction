Now Drake is over here, in the middle of eight nights at the O2 Arena, and he brings Kyla out every night for her big moment. \nTo say this was unexpected is an understatement. Kyla had never even met Drake when her voice was sampled from a 2008 club track in the dance subgenre known as UK funky. \nDo You Mind, sung by her and produced by DJ Paleface, had also been covered in smouldering style by The xx on a B-side the following year, but after that her focus was elsewhere. \nShe married Paleface, aka Errol Reid, and raised their son. Now she’s well and truly back in business, also featuring on Naughty Boy’s infectious recent single Should’ve Been Me. \nShe’ll perform that with him at an all-star show organised by the BBC Asian Network later this month and, after that, the world is belatedly her oyster. \nDrake, Feb 14-15, March 20, O2 Arena, SE10 (0844 824 4824, the02.co.uk ) \nBBC Asian Network Live, Feb 25, Eventim Apollo, W6 (0844 249 1000, eventimapollo.com ) More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:36:29.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
