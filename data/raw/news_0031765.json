When choosing weights, make sure if you’re sharing a barbell, kettlebell, wall ball, or dumbbells, you choose a weight that both partners can handle for the prescribed number of reps. \nKeep score and come back to these WODs again to see if you’ve improved. WOD 1: Hang in there \nWHAT: 20-minute EMOM (Every Minute, On the Minute): 5 barbell thrusters, 5 burpees \nHOW: You each have one minute to finish the reps. Whatever time is left in the minute is rest time. While Partner A completes the reps, Partner B is hanging from a pull-up bar. Switch every minute. WOD 2: High Five \nWHAT: AMRAP (As Many Rounds as Possible) in 15 minutes: 8 power cleans, 8 overhead presses. \nHOW: Partner A is doing the power cleans while Partner B is completing the overhead presses. Partners must wait for each other to complete the 8 reps before they can start that exercise. Once both partners finish 8 reps of each, they do 10 high-five pushups together. That’s one round. WOD 3: The 50s \nWHAT: For Time: 50 burpees, 50 air squats, 50 hollow rocks, 50 push-ups. Buy-in: 1000m row \nHOW: Must complete in order. One partner works while the other rests. Partners can alternate reps or one partner can finish a number of reps while the other rests. Both partners must complete a 1000m row before starting the rest of the workout. WOD 4: Chipper \nWHAT: For Time: Complete: 30 pull-ups, 50 wall balls, 50 sit-ups, 100 kettlebell swings. \nHOW: Each partner does not have to complete the same number of reps; break up the reps any way you want. (So, you could do 15 pull-ups, 25 wall balls, 25 sit-ups, and 100 kettlebell swings—or one of you could do more pull-ups while the other has to do more sit-ups.) You may work at the same time. Every 2 minutes, on the minute, stop and complete 10 burpees total. WOD 5: AMBAP: As Many Burpees As Possible \nWHAT: In 5 minutes, complete as many burpees as possible with your partner. \nHOW: You cannot go at the same time; Partner A must wait for Partner B to finish their burpee before starting their own. WOD 6: I plank, you plank \nWHAT: Complete a 5K row, 50 front squats, 60 box jumps. \nHOW: Break it up any way you like. Only one partner may work at a time. While one partner is working, the other is holding a plank. If the partner holding a plank drops out, partners switch places. WOD 7: Tag, you’re it! \nWHAT: AMRAP 10 pull-ups, 10 toes-to-bar, 10 overhead walking lunges (barbell or plate) \nHOW: Partner A goes out for a 500m run. While Partner A is gone, Partner B completes as many rounds as possible of 10 pull-ups, 10 toes-to-bar, 10 overhead walking lunges. When Partner A finishes the run they tag Partner B and switch places. WOD 8: Jump around \nWHAT: 15-minute EMOM of dumbbell snatches (8 per side) or barbell overhead press (10). \nHOW: Partners are working on different exercises and switch at the end of each minute. Remaining time in the minute after completing the prescribed reps is the rest period. Every third minute, both partners complete 50 double unders or 75 single-unders. For example: in minute 1, Partner A completes the dumbbell snatches while Partner B completes the overhead press. In minute two, they switch. In minute 3, they each complete the 50 double-unders or 75 single-unders. Continue this pattern for 15 minutes. \n[RELATED4]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T16:25:54.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
