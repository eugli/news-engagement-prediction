The rising cost of social care is a huge burden for councils Credit: PA \nThe extra cash must be spent on social care, however the LGA has warned the money will be \"swallowed up\" by the burden on councils paying the National Living Wage. \nThe continued shortfall, estimated to hit £2.6 billion by 2020, means other traditional services are likely to miss out. \nLord Porter, LGA chairman, said: \"Services supporting the most vulnerable people in our communities are at breaking point and many councils are increasingly unable to turn down the chance to raise desperately-needed money for social care and other local services next year. \n\"But extra council tax income will not bring in anywhere near enough money to alleviate the growing pressure on social care both now and in the future and the social care precept raises different amounts of money in different parts of the country. \n\"Social care faces a funding gap of at least £2.6 billion by 2020. It cannot be left to council taxpayers alone to try and fix this crisis. \n\"Without genuinely new additional Government funding for social care, vulnerable people face an ever uncertain future where they might no longer receive the dignified care and support they deserve.\" \nSo far 108 councils, around three quarters, are considering or have approved introducing the full 3% rise, while a quarter are considering or have approved a 2% rise. \nIt leaves just four councils who will have announced they will not apply the social care precept and they intend to, or have, frozen council tax next year. \nThe Government has said it will prop up services with a £240 million adult social care grant, but the LGA argues this is simply repackaging funding originally earmarked for house building.
