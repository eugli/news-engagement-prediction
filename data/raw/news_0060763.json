Muhammad Ali Jr. in 1999 (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 5:36 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:36 p.m. ET \nMuhammad Ali Jr. was detained by immigration officers for about two hours earlier this month at a Florida airport, the Miami New Times reported Friday. \nAttorney Chris Mancini, a friend of the Ali family, told the New Times that the son of the late boxing champion was questioned about his religion after arriving at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on a Feb. 7 flight from Jamaica. \nMORE: Olympian Ibtihaj Muhammad says she was recently held at U.S. Customs \nMancini said the 44-year-old Ali has a United States passport and no criminal record, but was nonetheless asked about his religion in two separate sessions with officials â presumably as a result of the executive order signed by President Donald Trump last month restricting travelers from several Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S. The measure was subsequently struck down after a legal challenge, and a federal appeals court upheld that ruling Feb. 9. \n\"WhatÂ right does the United States have to inquire about somebody's religion when they enter the country?\" Mancini said. \"There was no other basis for a secondary inspection. This is an instance where the ban has been enforced even though it has been thrown out. The government is still trying to find grounds to keep Muslims out.\" \nAli was traveling with his mother, Khalilah, who reportedly was not questioned by officers after she showed them a photo of herself with her late husband. \nThe Ali incident mirrors that of 2016 U.S. Olympian Ibtihaj Muhammad. The New Jersey-born fencer recently said she was detained for about two hours by customs officials.
