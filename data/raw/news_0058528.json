I think immigration is a big contributor to that.\"\nHowever, immigration attorney Francisco Hernandez told MacCallum that Trump's ordered immigration enforcement changes had \"written a blank check that he can't cash.\"\n\"He’s going to have to get the money from somewhere,\" Hernandez said, \"and we don’t have the money.\" \nIn last year's presidential election, a Fox News exit poll found that 10 percent of Florida voters said immigration was the biggest issue facing the country. Of those voters, 69 percent backed Trump over Hillary Clinton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:40:00.501+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
