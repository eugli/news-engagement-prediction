Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nGarth Crooks has viciously slammed Arsene Wenger and suggested the Arsenal boss should 'take a break from football'. \nThe former Spurs midfielder hit out at the Frenchman over his recent four-match ban. \nWenger received his suspension after pushing a fourth official during Arsenal's home game against Burnley last month. \nThe Gunners boss completed his ban on Saturday by taking to the stands during Arsenal's 2-0 win over Hull. \nBut speaking on BBC One's Final Score , Crooks believes enough is enough.

It happened again with Martin Jol. And again with Jose Mourinho. And then with the referee, or the fourth official. Wenger involved pushing the fourth official (Photo: Sky Sports) \n\"For me these are signs that there is something happening here with Arsene Wenger as he's getting old. The pressure may be getting to him a little bit, the judgement is a little more impaired. He's getting older.\" \nFellow pundit Keown attempted to defend his former boss. The former gunner said: \"He's getting frustrated, Garth. Those are three incidents in 20 years. Three incidents of discipline in 20 years. Maybe one is too many but it's about frustration.\" Wenger celebrates watches from the stands (Photo: Getty Images) \nBut Keown's protestations only further incensed the BBC pundit. \nCrooks added: \"Bill Shankly, Brian Clough never pushed officials or opposition managers, don’t tell me about managers and what they should do. I’ve seen great managers never behave like this. \n\"There is a code of conduct and what that’s indicating to me is here is a man under pressure. \n\"Now, I understand it’s a pressurised game, but at one stage when he pushed that fourth official I thought it’s time for you, Arsene, to take a break from the game.\" poll loading Should Arsene Wenger step down at the end of the season? 3000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T21:46:07.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
