The Beaches \nWhether it's barbecuing or wading into the low tide on Spanish Banks, playing volleyball on English Bay Beach or sunbathing on Kits Beach , summer weather makes Vancouver's already-stunning beaches the place to be. Summer Night Market in Richmond, BC. Image Courtesy of Summer Night Market 4. Summer Night Markets \nAsian-style night markets are a summer tradition in the Lower Mainland, and this year there are three night markets to visit. There are two huge night markets in Richmond : the Richmond Night Market and the International Summer Night Market, plus the Shipyards Night Market in North Vancouver. Both Richmond markets are must-sees; both feature over 300 vendors, amazing food (pork sui mai, Osaka balls, hurricane potatoes and sno-cones at the same time ), live entertainment, and attract nightly crowds of thousands. Celebration of Light Fireworks, Vancouver. Tourism Vancouver/ Clayton Perry 5. Celebration of Light - Vancouver's International Fireworks Competition \nIf there is one event that defines summer in Vancouver, it's the Celebration of Light international fireworks competition: three nights of the best fireworks displays you've ever seen.ï»¿ Lighting up the sky over English Bay in incredible colour compositions, the annual event ( late July - early August ) has become one of the most prestigious fireworks competitions in the world. Kits Pool in Vancouver, BC. Photo by Dana Lynch 6. Swimming in Kits Pool \nWith its white bottom and turquoise water and its spectacular views--of the ocean, the mountains, Kits Beach, and the Vancouver skyline glittering across English Bay-- Kits Pool (open mid-May - mid-September ) is a vacation destination unto itself! For me, just stepping through the gates feels like an escape. Summer wouldn't be summer without a swim in Kits Pool! Bard on the Beach Shakespeare Festival in Vancouver, BC. Image Courtesy of Bard on the Beach 7. Bard on the Beach \nWith the gorgeous summer weather comes lots of outdoor theatre and concerts: there's the Theatre Under the Stars in Stanley Park and the Enchanted Evenings Concert Series at Dr. Sun Yat Sen Chinese Garden . My favourite is the Shakespeare festival Bard on Beach , which stages plays in open-backed tents in Vanier Park : the northern mountains and glory of English Bay become the plays' backdrop. What could be more dramatic than that? Biking the Stanley Park Seawall. Image Courtesy of Tourism Vancouver 8. Stanley Park \nStanley Park may be a tourist destination--it attracts 8 million visitors a year--but it's also cherished by locals, especially in the summer months. When the sun shines, there's nothing better than biking or walking the scenic Seawall or hiking the 27km of forest trails. The Stanley Park Gardens are also a summer must-see! Vancouver Pride Parade in Vancouver, BC. Image Courtesy of the Vancouver Pride Society 9. Vancouver Pride Parade & Festival \nRainbow-coloured balloon awnings, fabulous drag queens, leather daddies: From the scantily-clad to the elaborately-head-dressed, Vancouver's Pride Parade ( July 31, 2016 ) is a magnificent display of diversity, spirit, creativity, and unity, and one of Vancouver's biggest summer events. Of course, the Parade is just the climax to an entire week of celebration: Pride week is packed with parties, art shows, and more. The Fair at the PNE in Vancouver, BC. Photo by Dana Lynch 10. Fair at the PNE \nIf there's one summer tradition that can bring out the kid in anyone, it's the annual Fair at the PNE ( August 20 - September 5, 2016 ). Cotton candy, mini donuts, Playland rides , farm animals, and live performers like Superdogs and the nightly concert series make this end-of-summer extravaganza one of the best family events of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:36:30.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
