The parameters of the deal were simple: The losing brewery had to produce a brew named after the winner. \nSo, after the New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons in epic fashion, Sweetwater was pegged with brewing a “Patriots Pale Ale,” and they certainly lived up to their word. A post shared by SweetWater Brewing Company (@sweetwaterbrew) on Feb 15, 2017 at 11:30am PST \nIt appears Sweetwater was still a bit bitter about the loss, as it describes the brew as “A soul crushing pale ale that will leave you feeling deflated.” They also clarified that no “GOATS” were harmed in the brewing process, despite valiant efforts. \nLuckily for Patriots fans, they won’t have to worry about seeing any Dirty Bird Lagers on the Sam Adams shelves. \nThumbnail photo via Greg M.
