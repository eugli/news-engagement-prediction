In his cover story interview, he broached the subject of his romance with Taylor Swift . \n“Taylor is an amazing woman. She’s generous and kind and lovely, and we had the best time,” he said, failing to address the actual question of whether or not the coupling was destiny or a publicity stunt . “Of course it was real,” he insisted. \nAs for that “I Heart TS” tank top he wore during the “Out of the Woods” singer’s Fourth of July bash at her Rhode Island mansion, Hiddleston said it wasn’t even his. 🇺🇸 A photo posted by Britany LaManna (@britmaack) on Jul 5, 2016 at 12:11pm PDT \n“The truth is, it was the Fourth of July and a public holiday and we were playing a game and I slipped and hurt my back,” he told GQ. “And I wanted to protect the graze from the sun and said, ’Does anyone have a T-shirt?’ And one of her friends said, ’I’ve got this.’ And we all laughed about it. It was a joke.” \nHe wants to be excluded from the false narratives surrounding the TS top. \n“A relationship exists between two people,” he said. “We will always know what it was. The narratives that are out there altogether have been extrapolated from pictures that were taken without consent or permission, with no context. Nobody had the context for that story. And I’m still trying to work out a way of having a personal life and protecting it, but also without hiding. So the hardest thing is that that was a joke among friends on the Fourth of July.” \nLena Dunham recently defended her friend’s relationships during an interview with Howard Stern for his SiriusXM show Monday, saying that dating in the public eye is never easy, especially for a young woman. \n“Not to repeat age-old feminist points, but it’s like, you know, any male actor her age who’s going out and dating is applauded, and to just have a perfectly normal amount of romantic partners but be held to impossibly high standards by the press,” Dunham told Stern, “like, it’s just an unfair and unwinnable game.” Also on HuffPost", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T17:34:32.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
