It was the most pain I’ve ever suffered in my life. \n“When I got to hospital, they did an X-ray and CT scan and I was not allowed to move. They wanted to keep me flat on my back.

He didn’t know if I was going to end up in a wheelchair.” \nLiza's injury occurred on the same day that George Magraw, 21, used the \"tower jump\" attraction and was left with a fractured spine. \nLiza said: “The pain is worse at night and I can hardly move in the mornings. \n“Some days I am really aching to the point where I want to watch telly but can’t sit in the chair to watch it. I just want to lie flat. \n“I can’t lean forwards or bend to pick things up, and I can’t lift things. \n\"It just feels like a massive ache sometimes and it’s difficult because I’m used to doing such an active job.” Read More Taxi driver in hospital after being hit by suspected drink driver in Wythenshawe \nFlip Out, which has voluntarily closed the tower jump, is also being investigated by Cheshire West and Chester Council amid safety concerns after stories of other injuries emerged. \nFollowing the incidents, Flip Out also uploaded a safety video on YouTube titled ‘We’re all about fun!
