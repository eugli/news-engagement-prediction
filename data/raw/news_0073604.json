He ordered Jacob Zuma, the South African president, to withdraw the “invalid” notification to the court of withdrawal. \nPretoria said last year it planned to leave the ICC after receiving criticism for ignoring the court’s order to arrest the visiting Sudanese president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir , who is accused of genocide and war crimes, in June 2015. The Gambia awaits new era of democracy under Adama Barrow Read more \nUnder the Rome statute, the founding treaty of the ICC, countries have a legal obligation to arrest anyone sought by the tribunal. Ministers had argued that the ICC’s obligations were inconsistent with domestic laws giving sitting leaders diplomatic immunity. \nThe clash over al-Bashir was the latest in a series of disputes rooted in deep suspicion of the institution among many leaders in Africa . \nOpened in July 2002, the court has repeatedly faced criticism by some on the continent who regard it as racist or imperialist. Nine out of the 10 cases being investigated by the ICC involve alleged crimes in Africa. \nLast month, African leaders adopted a strategy calling for a collective withdrawal from the court. The non-binding decision came behind closed doors near the end of an African Union summit. \nLate last year, Burundi and the Gambia also announced plans to leave the court, leading to concerns that other states would follow. \nIn a boost for the ICC, however, Adama Barrow, the new democratically elected president of the Gambia, recently reversed that decision – made by Yahya Jammeh, the west African state’s former authoritarian leader. Brawls break out in South African parliament after denunciation of Zuma Read more \nDefenders of the ICC, the first legal body with permanent international jurisdiction to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, say the majority of its investigations have followed an explicit request or grant of jurisdiction from the government in the country where the crimes were committed, as in the case of Uganda. \nWednesday’s decision in Pretoria high court was largely expected as Mojapelo had already told government lawyers during a previous hearing that he was concerned that officials had exceeded their constitutional powers. \nThe application to stop the withdrawal was brought by one of South Africa’s two main opposition parties – the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA). \n“We have seen how our country’s approach to foreign policy under [president] Jacob Zuma has been at loggerheads with the human rights-based foreign policy spearheaded by the late president Nelson Mandela. By irrationally withdrawing for the ICC, South Africa is out of touch with other progressive and democratic nations on the continent,” James Selfe, MP and chairperson of the DA’s federal executive, told reporters earlier this week. \nThe government will decide whether to appeal, officials said.
