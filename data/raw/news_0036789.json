She was full of life, and they are devastated at this loss,” MacDonald said. \nLoved ones filled All Saints Catholic Church in Dallas leaving standing room only. Amid the solemn mass, Claire Greenman took time to remember the light-hearted side of her childhood friend. \n“Even from early on, she was quite the boy magnet. Every boy who met her couldn’t help but fall in love with her incredible personality and beautiful face,” Greenman told the crowd. \n“She was a great friend, honestly. She was so fun to be around, and whenever you were with her, you just felt like you were on the top of the world,” friend and classmate Ben Mason added outside the church after the funeral. \nInvestigators say the Porsche SUV Davis’s friend was driving, sped through a stop sign before crashing into a tree and catching fire. \nCounselors have been available at the girls’ school.
