Smith bricks jumpers Alysha Tsuji , USA TODAY 5:31 p.m. ET Feb. 14, 2017 \nJames Harden to Stephen A. Smith: \"Stick to your day job.\" (Photo: ESPN) \nJames Harden and Stephen A. Smith hung out for a bit on Valentine's Day for a First Take interview. Smith tried to show off his 3-point shot while Harden tossed him passes. It didn't go so well. \nHarden called out Smith by posting video of him airballing and writing, \"Please … stick to your day job,\" with an appropriate number of laughing emojis. — James Harden (@JHarden13) February 14, 2017 \nBut then, the Rockets star, tried to tell people to stop being so harsh because it's Valentine's Day and all. Please people, it's Valentines Day show @stephenasmith some love today. Lol — James Harden (@JHarden13) February 14, 2017 In all seriousness, I had a great time shooting around with @stephenasmith . Good convo, good vibes. — James Harden (@JHarden13) February 14, 2017 \nIt's too late, though. The video has been shared thousands of times on Twitter alone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:43:49.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
