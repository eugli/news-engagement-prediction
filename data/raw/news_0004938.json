A representative from the L.A. Police Department told Billboard the suspects made away with about $175,000 worth of jewelry and other property. \nThe burglary happened while Minaj was out of town recently, and she has not commented on the incident. Meanwhile, police are investigating and have not named any suspects. Here’s hoping whoever’s behind the invasion left some incriminating pinkprints behind.
