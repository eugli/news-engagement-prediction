It’s fair to say that you’d be unlikely to hear this on Coronation Street. \nFor context, the actual storyline is a lot less slapstick and way more serious than the individual line would lead you to believe. As part of Harry’s story, images of his penis were shared with his girlfriend Lily and his dad Chris was horrified to find them as his phone was synced to the tablet. (Picture: TVNZ) \nBut the attention for a long time was purely on Chris’ now iconic delivery of THAT line: Not a fan of Shortland Street, but \"Please tell me that is not your penis\" is hilarious. Hollywood take notes. \n— Jordan Beck (@BeckFiction) February 15, 2017 Home and Away can fuck off, they'll never beat that Shortland Street cliffhanger \"TELL ME THIS ISN'T YOUR PENIS \" \n— SEXTINA AQUAFINA (@lisalovesbacon) February 15, 2017 Shortland Street penis cliffhanger ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:45:33.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
