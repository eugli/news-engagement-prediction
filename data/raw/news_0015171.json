With such developments of the events, on Sunday Tokyo somewhat backtracked on his promise, stressing that no militarily capabilities will be offered by Japan to the US. \n“I told Secretary Mattis that Japan supports the US military’s freedom of navigation operation in the sea. But the SDF will not be sent to the area,\" Inada said Sunday, Jiji press reports. \n“Japan will play its role through defense cooperation and training,” she added, clarifying that Tokyo will also consider increasing its defense budget and reinforcing its defense capabilities. \nOn his first trip to Asia as secretary of defense, Mattis explicitly stated in Tokyo that the Trump administration will honor US-Japan security treaty and protect Japan against any aggression.

The Spratly Islands, or Spratlys, comprise more than 750 islets, atolls and reefs, and lie off the coastlines of Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and China, with all the claimants having their own national names for the archipelago. Beijing continues to claim the reefs in defiance of a Hague International Arbitration Court verdict. \nAhead of Mattis’ visit to Japan, Beijing has once again reminded the US that it will defend the country's territorial integrity. \n“China has indisputable sovereignty over the relevant islands and reefs in the South China Sea and the adjacent waters,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters Friday during a regular press briefing. “China will firmly safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:21:20.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
