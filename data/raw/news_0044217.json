Picture: Craig Wilson A decision to place a power pole at the top of a private driveway has forced the homeowner to give up using his Mercedes sports car Jim O’Rourke, Inner West Courier Inner City February 20, 2017 12:00am \nPETER Gronow bought his sleek black Mercedes Benz SLK 350 as a retirement present to himself. \nThe former film and TV special effects whiz dreamt of touring the country with his wife Lisa in the 11-year-old convertible — until he was poleaxed by bureaucracy. \nMr Gronow has been battling with electricity distributors Ausgrid about the location of a power pole at the front of his heritage-listed cottage in Dening St, Drummoyne since it was repositioned in 1982. \nIt meant that he could not move his car out of the driveway without having to alter course to the left to get round the obstruction. \nTo add to his misery, Ausgrid recently bolted a large steel brace — which juts out 15cms — around the pole making it even harder for the Gronow’s to enter and exit their property. \n“I’m in my 70s now and my wife and I are getting more and more nervous about getting our cars in and out of the driveway without banging into the pole,” Mr Gronow said. \n“It’s really affecting our enjoyment of the car. You just don’t want to risk moving it. Lisa refuses to use the driveway now. media_camera Peter Gronow has damaged his Mercedes Coupe because he has to manoeuvre around an Ausgrid pole at the top of his driveway.

I’m asking Ausgrid for the money.” media_camera The pole at the end of Peter Gronow’s driveway means he has to make a quick turn to the left to avoid scraping his car. Picture: Craig Wilson \nOn January 18 Ausgrid installed a new pole about a metre away from the old one, and further away from the driveway entrance, but didn't to tell Mr Gronow when the old pole would be removed. \nAfter the Inner West Courier contacted Ausgrid Mr Gronow received a notice that the pole will be taken done this week. media_camera Peter Gronow has to manoeuvre around an Ausgrid pole at the end of his driveway.
