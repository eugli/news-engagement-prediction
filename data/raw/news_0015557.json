Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nManchester United's on-loan winger Adnan Januzaj has dropped a hint that he would be willing to be converted into a striker after playing alongside Jermain Defoe at Sunderland . \nThe Red Devils loanee enjoyed perhaps his best performance yet for the Black Cats in the 4-0 thrashing of Crystal Palace at the weekend, assisting two goals for Defoe, report the Manchester Evening News . \nJanuzaj lined up alongside Defoe up front in a 4-4-2 diamond formation and David Moyes' side could keep this formation for the visit of Southampton on Saturday. \n\"I really like playing with him [Defoe] even though he always asks for the ball,\" he told the Sunderland website. \"He’s an unbelievable striker and you can see that with his goals because they weren’t easy chances. Januzaj linked up well with Defoe at Selhurst Park (Photo: Dean Mouhtaropoulos) \nSunderland to jet off to New York as David Moyes looks to inspire relegation candidates \n\"He’s someone I can learn a lot from. In the last few games we’ve linked really well and I think we have a good relationship with each other. We’re enjoying playing together and hopefully he can score many more goals. \n\"Like I said before, it’s much easier for me and JD when the team are playing with confidence.\" \nJanuzaj never played up front under David Moyes or Louis van Gaal but did have a stint as United's playmaker at the start of last term, scoring the winner at Aston Villa. \nVan Gaal said after Januzaj netted against Barcelona in a friendly a month earlier he had the potential to become a striker.
