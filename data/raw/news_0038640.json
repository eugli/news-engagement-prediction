Thank you.” \nThere’s even a love heart on the end, because this is a truly heartfelt V-Day message. \nUntil you get to the cartoon below of it. Brutal. Source: Reddit \nYep. That’s the teacher pushing a poor, helpless young student ... off a cliff. Off a damn cliff, into a giant pit of goals. \nWhich is evidently a grim and painful death. \nThere’s even a little speech bubble coming from his mouth, suggesting he’s screaming. Not to mention, his mouth is open in terror as she throws him down: Miss, no! Source: Reddit No please! Source: Reddit WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? Source: Reddit \nThe post has gone viral since it was uploaded to Reddit, with over 55,000 upvotes in less than 24 hours. \nBut really, you can’t blame the kid for trying. At the end of the day, he couldn’t help ... falling for her . \nSorry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:59:05.910+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
