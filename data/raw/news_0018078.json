The state is ready. The time is now.” \nMI-NORML has conducted this same poll twice before, once in 2014 and again in 2015. In 2014 the question garnered 50 percent support for marijuana legalization. In 2015 the number of residents approving rose to 53 percent. The group says progress reflects the state’s awareness and national advances in law reform. \nFive states passed pro-marijuana proposals during the November 2016 election. MILegalize is currently drafting language for a new petition drive in hopes of getting the issue in front of Michigan voters on the 2018 ballot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T14:22:51.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
