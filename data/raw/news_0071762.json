Murphy said he heard a gunshot, which was aimed at Miracle’s leg. \nAccording to WJXT Jacksonville , Murphy told local police that his pooch might have leaped on the “nightstand where the weapon was placed and it went off.” \nAwakened with excruciating pain, Miracle was taken to a nearby hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. \nMurphy’s neighbors couldn’t imagine how an innocent pooch like Diesel could shoot someone. “I think, either way, there was a weapon involved,” neighbor Donald Hanlon told the news site. “I don’t think it was intentional, but I don’t think the dog could do it.” \nPolice were investigating the incident.
