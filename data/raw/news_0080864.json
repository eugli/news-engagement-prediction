Image copyright AFP Image caption Barack Obama consistently enjoyed healthy approval ratings among French voters \n\"We think we can do something else than the extreme,\" said one of the organisers, who refuse to reveal their names, saying they want the focus to remain on the campaign and not on them as individuals. \n\"We are anti-political, we are not against any candidate in particular, but we are not a big fan of any of them. [This campaign is] a way to say 'Guys, eh wake up - you are uncool, and this campaign is uncool - we'd rather have Obama'.\" \nThe viral take-off of the campaign caught them by surprise - but the French media, said the organiser, has failed to get the joke. \n\"They are very annoyed, people take it all too seriously,\" he said, adding that even the left-leaning newspaper Liberation ended a short piece on the campaign on a sniffy note : \"If that's what amuses them...\" \n\"We want this to stay on the joke level,\" he says.
