But I think we’ll be a lot more aggressive this year. That’s what I’ve picked up from last year.” \nThe key to unlocking that more assertive system could once again fall upon the shoulders of star player Dustin Martin. Only this year, he’s likely to receive more help as a result of the club’s rather productive trade period. \nLive stream EVERY game of the JLT Community Series on FOX SPORTS.

Martin’s tally of only nine goals from 22 games was the first time in his seven-year career that he had failed to notch double figures across a single campaign. \nBut with captain Trent Cotchin in desperate need of help in the trenches — and with Hardwick under pressure to improve team performance — he was left with little choice other than to move Martin into the middle. \nThis season, with additional midfield depth at his disposal, Hardwick will again have the option of rotating one of the competition’s most difficult forward match-ups back inside 50. \nIn the five years preceding last season, Martin slotted 130 goals from 110 games — the type of output some stay-at-home forwards in the competition would be proud of. \nYet he combined that tally with an average of more than 22 disposals per game in each year, proving just how effective he can be when the right balance in where he is best used is struck. \nLast season, the Tigers just couldn’t get that mix right. \nHe played too often through the midfield, winning too many of his possessions in the back half of the field. Given his influence forward of centre, that was a win for opposition sides. \nBut the arrival of both Prestia and Caddy will free up Martin to spend more time forward, where he will again impact games in a way only few in the competition can. \nIn Prestia, the Tigers have an inside machine who not only wins his own footy, but also uses it effectively. According to Champion Data’s AFL Prospectus , the 24-year-old is one of only seven players in the competition to average both 10 contested possessions and 400m gained per game. \nWhile he has dealt with his fair share of injury issues over the last two years, battling a series of knee problems, he looms as an important figure for the Tigers should he return to full fitness. \nCaddy, meanwhile, offers Richmond the perfect foil for Martin — a player who can rotate both through the midfield and up forward and can act as an effective option in both positions. \nConsecutive seasons with an average of more than 20 disposals per game at Geelong was complemented by a tally of 37 goals from 37 matches across that period. \nAccording to Champion Data , Caddy was also ranked first for all mid-forwards in the competition for score involvements last season. \nThe pair give Richmond’s midfield a different dimension in 2017. \nThe two big-bodied options provide the midfield group with ball winners on the inside, but explosive run-and-carry players when they find it in space. \nHowever, one of the most important aspects of their recruitment to Punt Road could be just how much they benefit Martin’s impact on the game. \nAnd, given the likelihood their arrival means ‘Dusty’ spends more time inside 50, that could be pivotal for Hardwick’s Tigers in 2017.
