Draymond Green (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 12:39 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 12:39 a.m. ET \nSometimes, Draymond Green is his own worst enemy. \nThe Warriors star was ejected from Wednesday night's game against the Kings after he was called for a foul on DeMarcus Cousins and subsequently threw a tantrum. \nMORE: Carmelo Anthony to replace injured Kevin Love as All-Star reserve \nGreen was flabbergasted that his clear foul was called a foul in the second quarter, and he shouted expletives at anyone in the vicinity. That earned him his first technical foul. He then continued to talk while Sacramento shot a free throw, resulting in a second technical and an ejection. \nCousins scored on what appeared to be a shot fake, as the ball flew into the air and then the basket. \nGreen now has 11 technical fouls this season, tied for fourth most in the NBA. It so happens Cousins leads the league with 19. \nGreen got the day started making controversial comments regarding James Dolan, stating the Knicks owner used a \"slave master mentality\" while dealing with the Charles Oakley feud. Just another day for Draymond Green. Watch This ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T12:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T08:04:38.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
