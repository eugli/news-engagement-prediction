It could be you or me,\" he said, pointing at past wars and an increasingly uncertain world order. \"The so-called refugee crisis is a human crisis.\" \nOver the past 12 months, Ai and his film crews have visited migrant and refugee hotspots across 22 countries, from the US-Mexican border badlands to the Turkish-Syrian frontier and crowded holding camps on Greek islands. \nNow back in his Berlin studio, Ai talked to AFP about the result of his tour de force, the epic documentary project \"Human Flow\", set for global cinema release in the late northern summer of this year. \n\"The issue really needs to be understood better by the people who are privileged to still have peace,\" the 59-year-old said. \n\"Peace is always temporary. No-one can be guaranteed to always have peace. \n\"If you look at the world's condition today, war still can happen at any moment, there is such uncertainty about our politics, and so many unanswered questions.\" \n'BOAT NOT FULL' \nAi said he viewed US politics now as \"quite sad, quite disturbing ... in many ways going backwards\", pointing at Trump's comments that label entire \"groups of people as terrorists or drug dealers\".

It's not just Mexicans who need the United States, the states bordering Mexico equally depend so much on the low-cost labour.\" \n'SECRET DETENTION' \nAi has staged several high-profile exhibitions on the mass flight of people from Syria and other trouble spots to Europe, often on dangerous Mediterranean crossings. \nLast year he decked out the columns of Berlin's Konzerthaus with 14,000 orange life jackets from the Greek island of Lesbos. In Florence, he hung 22 red rubber dinghies from the facade of a Renaissance palace.

Ai is in Greece to shoot a documentary. REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov \nAi said his personal history has shaped his interest in human flight and displacement. \n\"When I was young, my father was exiled,\" he said about the poet Ai Qing, who fell out of favour with Mao Zedong's regime. \n\"We had to move to a very remote area in China and I grew up in kind of military camps,\" recalled Ai. \n\"So I am very sensitive to people forced by different reasons - it could be political, war, famine, environmental problems -- to seek, willingly or unwillingly, new locations and possibilities.\" \nIn a sense, he too feels like a refugee. \nHaving helped design Beijing's Bird's Nest Olympic stadium, he later drew the wrath of the state for his outspoken activism. \nAi was detained for 81 days in 2011 and then had his Chinese passport confiscated for four years. Many of his fellow activists have been jailed. \n\"I was in China but now I am being almost forced out of China because all those lawyers are still in jail and all those people I know are still in secret detention,\" he said. \n\"I have been put in the same kind of situation and it's very possible it can happen to me again,\" said Ai. \"This is the reality.\" - CNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:15:46.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
