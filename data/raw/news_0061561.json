It’s tracking for a $120 million North American debut, though Disney insiders are staying conservative with a weekend bow closer to $100 million-plus. Either total would give Bill Condon ‘s fairy tale film one of the top spots ever for March , placing it well above Oz the Great and Powerful , and possibly passing Disney’s live-action juggernaut Alice in Wonderland . (The month’s top two earners are currently The Hunger Games and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice , which are likely out of reach for the moment.) THR reported on the bullish box office prediction. \nScripted by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos with music by Disney veteran Alan Menken , the film stars Emma Watson , Dan Stevens , Luke Evans , Kevin Kline , Josh Gad , Ewan McGregor , Stanley Tucci , Audra McDonald , Gugu Mbatha-Raw , Ian McKellen , and Emma Thompson . Beauty and the Beast opens in theaters on March 17th.
