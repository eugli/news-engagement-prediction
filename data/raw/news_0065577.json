(Photo: Provided by Columbia Pictures) 590 CONNECT 9 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nDozens of movies have been filmed in Indiana, and dozens more tell stories that take place in Indiana. \nWe figured it was time to proclaim one of them the \"Best Indiana-centric Picture Ever.\" \nWe nominated 25 films, in six categories. We presented the list to an expert panel of our choosing. Its 13 members, locals all, selected winners in each category and, ultimately, an overall Best Indiana-centric Picture Ever. \nThe nominees: \nDivision I: Hoosier Classics \n\"Breaking Away\" (1979) — Story about pretension and class-based meanness set in Bloomington, where locals, derided as \"cutters\" (Dennis Christopher, Dennis Quaid, Daniel Stern) rise up and compete with college kids — and beat those jerks. \n\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (1977) — Typical, average Hoosier from Muncie (Richard Dreyfuss) sees a UFO; his odyssey commences. \n\"Going All the Way\" (1997) — Coming-of-age/buddy story of cool guy Gunner (Ben Affleck) and geek Sonny (Jeremy Davies); probably the Hoosierest movie ever because: A) the story was written by an Indianapolis-born novelist who is one of our panelists, Dan Wakefield; B) the action takes place in Indianapolis; C) the movie was filmed in Indiana. \n\"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942) — Story of a rich, genteel Indianapolis family that gets crushed by the industrial revolution; story based on the novel by Indianapolis writer Booth Tarkington. \nAnd the winner is \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" \n\"Humankind has yet to concede to the possibility of intelligence in the universe that is superior to our own,\" said panelist Alpha Blackburn, an interior designer, fashion designer and painter, and a director of Heartland Film. \"This is a saga of enduring intrigue and intellectual curiosity.\" \nDivision II: Sports \n\"A League of Their Own\" (1992) — Pro women's baseball team (with Geena Davis and Madonna, among others, and Tom Hanks as their coach) competes with heart; filmed extensively in Indiana: Evansville, New Harmony, Huntingburg, St. Phillips. \n\"Eight Men Out\" (1987) — Chicago baseball players including ones played by John Cusack and Charlie Sheen agree to throw the 1919 World Series; filmed partly at Indianapolis' old Bush Stadium on 16th Street. \n\"Madison\" (2005) — Tale of big-time hydroplane racing on the Ohio River at Madison, where the underdogs, the Hoosiers, in an outdated boat, win; filmed in Madison; written and directed by Indianapolis-born brothers Bill and Scott Bindley. \n\"Hoosiers\" (1986) — A little Indiana town rises up and is counted by winning the state high school basketball championship. \nAnd the winner is \"Hoosiers.\" \n\"No other sports film has the cross-generational appeal or climactic endorphin rush as this 1986 masterpiece,\" said panelist Stuart Lowry, president of Heartland Film. \n(Photo: Provided by Orion Pictures) \nDivision III: Biopics \n\"Public Enemies\" (2009) — John Dillinger, the Indianapolis-born bank robber (Johnny Depp), takes money that isn't his, seduces a woman, gets away from the cops over and over.

Johnny says, 'Black coffee.'\" \n\"Fascinating,\" panelist Pauline Moffat, executive director of IndyFringe Festival, said of \"Kinsey.\" \"Who knew Alfred Kinsey and his students were getting up to such antics in Bloomington, Indiana.\" \n(Photo: Provided by Twentieth Century Fox) \nDivision IV: Tearjerkers \n\"Brian's Song\" (1971) — Biracial buddy story involving Chicago Bears football players Gale Sayers (Billy Dee Williams) and Brian Piccolo in which Piccolo (James Caan) dies of cancer; some scenes shot in Rensselaer, Ind. \n\"The Ryan White Story\" (1989) — A 13-year-old boy from Kokomo is diagnosed with AIDS, bravely faces discrimination and fear; he dies. \n\"The Fault in Our Stars\" (2014) — Hoosier novelist John Green's story about two Indianapolis teenagers who fall in love.
