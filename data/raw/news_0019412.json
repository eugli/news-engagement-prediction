Breach costs \nThe differing views could contribute to the inevitable confusion that follows when firms, both large and small, suffer a breach, said Dr Nish. \n\"That is definitely a weakness and it will lead to organisations not being prepared for oncoming attacks,\" he said. \nThe two groups also differed when asked about breach costs. \nTechnology bosses believed that, on average, a breach would cost a company about $19m (£15m). \nThe estimate included fines, legal fees, remediation expenses and compensation for customers. By contrast, boardroom members put an average price tag of $11.6m (£9.2m) on breaches. \n\"Any business you're in, whether it's media or pharmaceuticals or a charity, your business is involved in tech in some way, shape or form,\" said Adam Thilthorpe, director for professionalism at BCS, the chartered institute for IT. \n\"There are lots of people on the boards who think cybersecurity is not related to being a director of a company. \n\"How many TalkTalks does it take to realise the buck stops at the top?\" he said, referring to a 2015 attack on the telecoms firm. \nOliver Parry, head of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, said businesses should focus on \"preventative measures\" to protect against cyber-threats. \n\"As with other principle risks to a business, responsibility of outlining this strategy should fall with the board. \n\"Lasting cybersecurity only comes from embedding good practice throughout the culture of an organisation, starting from the top. No system or person alone can prevent indefinitely the threat of a cyber-attack.\" Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T20:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T15:58:02.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
