So many of their indie roots/folk rock tracks fit right in with that story's narrative. Or maybe not. Maybe it's because the band's songs are just worn - in a good way. They're a slice of Americana worn to perfection - be it last year's Don't Take Off or 2014's The Patterns . In any event, let's move on because it'll sound like smoke if I gush anymore. \nThe band is the brainchild of Hartford, CT's Connor Zane Millican who honed the sound after traveling out west and returning home. What originally started out as a one-man show with hired guns performing the songs live (three years and over 200 performances) has now turned into a full-fledged band. Speaking of which, at the Music Conservatory of Westchester last week, Millican and that band were on hand to perform \"Day Grifter\" and chat about the band's evolution. Wise Old Moon will next play Port Chester, NY at a special A-Sides show commemorating the series' fifth anniversary alongside Kopps, Whitney Tai, and Faulkner. Get tickets here , and watch the session unfold below. \nA-Sides Premieres Mouth Sounds' New Track A-Sides first met Daniel Howie when he was fronting Charlotte's alt-rock band Sugar Glyder. The band crushed their session, but broke up soon after. Howie is back, thankfully, in the form of Mouth Souths which steers a bit more alt-electro. We're pleased to unleashed his debut single \"In the Night\" off his forthcoming seven-song EP entitled Sing or Swim on Coast Records. The album drops.Feb. 28.

A-Sides focuses on the artist making art in a low-threatening, extremely informal (sometime humorous) way. No bells, no whistles -- just the music performed in a random, low-key setting followed by an unrehearsed chat. In an industry where everything often gets overblown and over manufactured, Jon strives for a refreshing change. From time to time, the series also features humor columns, film/TV personality interviews, and a kid-centric spin-off called \"Lowercase A-Sides.\" Artists featured on the series have included Elle King, Joe Perry, Alice Cooper, James Bay, Jimmy Eat World, Imagine Dragons, Melissa Etheridge, Yoko Ono, Charli XCX, Marina and the Diamonds, and Bastille. Theme song written and performed by Blondfire.
