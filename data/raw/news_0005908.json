Some people are of the view that it should go, some say it should be there. Some have suggested the system at AIR India should be changed. The SC has given its verdict. \n“Hence, the experts committee has been formed to look into these aspects. It will speak to all the stakeholders and soon, we will figure out some way,” he said on asked about the issue of floating global tender for air travel to Haj. \nAccording to sources, the panel will examine implications of various directions of the apex court with regard to the existing Haj policy, and suitable amendments in it. \nThe committee will also review the effectiveness of Haj Committee of India’s management of pilgrims’ accommodation and air travel. \nIt will also assess the aspects of transparency, consumer satisfaction and disclosure requirements for private tour operators to protect interest of the pilgrims with a view to make the policy of greater assistance to the pilgrims, the sources said. \nLast month, in the biggest hike in nearly three decades, Saudi Arabia had increased India’s annual Haj quota by 34,500, increasing it from 1,36,020 to 1,70,520 pilgrims. \nThe Supreme Court had in 2012 directed the Union government to gradually reduce and abolish Haj subsidy by 2022. \nIt had asked the government to invest the subsidy amount of approximately Rs 650 crore a year then on educational and social development of the community. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T15:10:12.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
