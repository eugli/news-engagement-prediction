Joel Embiid (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:24 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:24 a.m. ET \nJoel Embiid had an interesting Valentine's Day. \nThe drama started early when reality TV starÂ Olivia Pierson, featured on E!'s 'WAGs', posted a photo on Instagram with the 76ers big man, lying shirtless in bed next to her. She added a caption that made it pretty clear they were dating as she wished him a happy Valentine's Day. \nMORE: Magic, Raptors both winners in Serge Ibaka trade \nThe photo got attention as no one knew the couple were dating. Many thought Embiid was still chasing after Rihanna or his unknown celebrity crush.Â \nWhile Pierson appears to be under the belief they're dating, Embiid responded pretty strongly. He added a comment to her post saying, \"Old news, I'm not trusting this process,\" and he also uploaded the photo to Instagram Stories with the hashtag \"Fake News.\" \nBoth Pierson and Embiid deleted their posts, so who knows what's really going on here.
