While most celebs looked stunning, not every star found a place on our best dressed list. The following looks were just a touch off. 1. Dakota Johnson \nJohnson's long-sleeve, ecru Gucci with a high neckline is a tad matronly for the starlet. \nIt's a lot of fabric, in a color that doesn't necessarily flatter her complexion. (Photo: Dan MacMedan-USA TODAY NETWORK) 2. Blanca Blanco \nPerhaps you don't know her name, but you will remember this dress. The actress' number with pattern, poufy sleeves, red belt and major slit has a lot going on. \nThough not nominated for an Oscar, she could be the winner for highest slit. (Photo: Dan MacMedan-USA TODAY NETWORK) 3. Felicity Jones \nWhile Jones' glam is on point, the color of the Rogue One: A Star Wars Story star's Dior gown washes her out. \nWould've loved the A-line frock in lilac. (Photo: Dan MacMedan-USA TODAY NETWORK) 4. Leslie Mann \nMann's Zac Posen dress really brightens up the red carpet, but the billowing silhouette overwhelms the How to Be Single actress. \nA sleek column shape would've made this look timeless. (Photo: Dan MacMedan-USA TODAY NETWORK) 5. Olivia Culpo \nThe good news is Culpo's Marchesa dress brought attention to the global water crisis, the bad news is the black belt was distracting. Culpo told E!'s Ryan Seacrest that the dress is made with pieces from a Stella Artois chalice in partnership with Water.org, which when purchased , provides five years of clean water. \nThe bad news is she ended up here. (Photo: Dan MacMedan-USA TODAY NETWORK) 6. Riz Ahmed \nWe applaud men who give the Heisman to a basic black tux, but the bright color of this look by Ermenegildo Zegna verges on costume-y. \nSadly, giving us a touch of the blues. (Photo: Frazer Harrison, Getty Images) 7. Ava DuVernay \nIt's so hard to wear slate, and the director nearly pulls it off. However, a warmer shade would've done wonders for this ensemble by Ashi Studio. \nOne shade of grey. (Photo: Dan MacMedan-USA TODAY NETWORK) 8. Priyanka Chopra \nThe fit and pattern of this number by Ralph & Russo are perfection, but this neckline is a tad severe. Rounded edges or a sweetheart neckline would've been better. \nShe still shines. (Photo: Dan MacMedan-USA TODAY NETWORK) 9. Ryan Gosling \nHey girls (and guys), placing Sebastian on this list hurts us as much as it hurts you. But the ruffled Gucci shirt with contrasting seams is tough to swallow. \nDon't be mad at us, Ryan.
