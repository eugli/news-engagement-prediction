Sibelga has been keeping people updated via Twitter and said it aimed to have power restored just after midnight. The suburbs of Evere, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert and Schaerbeek have all been affected. An earlier power cut is understood to have hit a smaller part of the city earlier in the evening but was 'resolved by 8.30pm'. Residents have been forced to use candles and have posted pictures of their efforts to restore light on social media. Lights are still on in some EU buildings, including the European Council and European Commission headquarters. Some residents are currently seeing the funny side, spelling out 'help' in candles Power firms have confirmed a fault in the network with repair teams 'on site' working to fix the issue Share or comment on this article 32", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:37:19.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
