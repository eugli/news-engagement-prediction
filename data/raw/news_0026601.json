Dressed casually in a striped top and black pants, she did not seem to fit the part of the well-heeled women of Westminster or its dog-sweater-wearing fanciers. On the edge of a green-carpeted show ring, she teetered between anonymity and renown. Hearst Shaw, the 62-year-old granddaughter of William Randolph Hearst, has been a regular on the dog-show circuit for more than decade. Here she is known as Patricia. But history knows her as Patty Hearst, the heiress kidnapped in 1974 by a radical group, the Symbionese Liberation Army, who spent almost two years in prison before President Jimmy Carter commuted her sentence. President Bill Clinton issued a pardon in 2001. Before her French bulldogs, Tuggy and Rubi, entered the show ring at Pier 94, Hearst Shaw mingled in the benching area with two of her granddaughters. The girls smooshed the dogs’ ears and snuggled in close for kisses as their mother, Gillian Hearst, smiled. Once breed judging began, the girls wiggled in their seats, waiting nearly two hours before all 46 Frenchies, one of the largest entries in the field, trotted around the ring. Before the judge made her final decision, Hearst Shaw jumped to her feet. She just knew. Tuggy won best of breed, and Rubi took runner-up honors as best of opposite sex. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “I have quite a record of best of opposite at Westminster,” she said. “I was like, ‘Ahhhh! I broke that barrier.’” Tuggy competed Monday night in the nonsporting group final for a chance at a spot in Tuesday’s best in show.

Credit Karsten Moran for The New York Times The sweep is considered uncommon, given the number of French bulldog entries. Among the 200 breeds and varieties at the dog show, golden retrievers have the biggest contingent with 85, followed by Labrador retrievers and French bulldogs, with 46 each. New Yorkers entered the most dogs, 260 of the 2,798. There were 135 foreign entries from 16 countries. Perhaps it is fitting that Westminster’s top French bulldog belongs to Hearst Shaw, a New Yorker. The breed is the city’s most popular dog, according to the American Kennel Club. “They’re calm,” Hearst Shaw said. “They don’t like to go for long walks or runs, so that makes them a good city dog.” She added, “They are built for Paris, which means they do just fine in New York.” With Westminster being Rubi’s last show, she will join Hearst Shaw in New York with Frida, another retired Frenchie. “Three of my dogs passed away last year — it was really shocking for them to go all at once,” she said. “It’s lonely in my house, but soon I’ll hear the pitter-patter of little feet.” At the moment, Frida is whelping a litter. While Tuggy and Rubi were not far from home, they were joined in the benching area by two bulldogs who had arrived from Japan on Friday. Their two-day journey began on midnight in Gunma, about a two-hour drive from Toyko. It took about four hours for the dogs to clear quarantine before they boarded their flight at 10 a.m. to Kennedy International Airport. Because the airline, ANA, does not allow dogs in coach, the animals, named Nonna and Paris, spent 12 hours in cargo. \nAdvertisement With crates equipped with fans, ice packs and a water bottle, they arrived in New York at 9 a.m. on Friday.
