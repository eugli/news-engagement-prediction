Opera Off Grand production at REDCAT, Ted Hearne’s The Source felt as much like immersive installation art as opera or oratorio. Individual performances by the four singers embedded in the audience are not as memorable as the overall effect of this politically charged, affecting piece that tells a nonlinear version of Chelsea Manning’s WikiLeaks intelligence dump story. \nThroughout the piece, the singer’s voices were processed in real time through computers (think Auto-Tune) while massive, up-close video shots of human faces were projected on 360-degree screens. The impact of this piece was not in actually watching the atrocities these men and women were observing in the videos but in the intimate, extended observation of the witnesses’ facial expressions as they grimaced and their eyes welled with tears, the images of people dying in war zones on screens in front of them reflected, ever so faintly, in their eyeglasses and pupils. \nComing up next in this series (in June) is another politically poignant work, this time by composer Kamala Sankaram. Thumbprint explores gang rape and justice in Pakistan. Like The Source , it is yet another Beth Morrison Projects production. \nInvisible Cities I didn’t live in L.A. in 2014, so I missed t he Industry’s much-lauded premiere of Invisible Cities , a complex performance that took over Union Station and was performed live for audience members wandering the station wearing headphones. But I did go down to San Pedro this fall to see a beautifully produced film of the piece shown in a historic movie theater. \nComposer Christopher Cerrone’s melodies were haunting and sensuous and protagonist Kublai Khan’s story was eerily pertinent. While the innovative format of this piece was its most defining characteristic, like any good opera, beautiful, intricate music is what sustained it even outside of its original setting. I left that theater engrossed in a magical sound world that settled around me like coastal fog and stayed with me for hours. \nThe screening I saw doubled as the announcement event for the Industry’s next project. (Its last was Hopscotch , the nomadic 2015 opera that took place literally on the streets of L.A.). In 2017, the Industry will produce a new operatic adaptation of Brecht’s Galileo . According to Yuval Sharon, the Industry’s artistic director, who teased the upcoming project before the San Pedro screening of Invisible Cities , the company is still working out the details for next fall’s “Galileo,” which may or may not involve a bonfire on the beach and/or a helicopter entrance. \nVireo This opera is yet another radical experiment in form. It’s the world’s first streamable, binge-able opera, and it won’t be available in its entirety until spring of 2017. The brainchild of composer Lisa Bielawa, Vireo: The Spiritual Biography of a Witch’s Accuser is a wild, imaginative exploration of young women’s mysterious experiences with hysteria and visions throughout history and the powerful male figures (doctors, priests) who have sought to explain them. \nOne of its 12-minute episodes was produced in a Boyle Heights warehouse earlier this spring, and I snagged a free ticket to the filming . Standing in a cramped corner behind an atonal instrument of giant, hanging glass vessels, I was impressed by both the complexity of Bielawa’s vision and the improbable seamlessness of its execution. The opera’s star — 17-year-old Rowen Sabala from Orange County — is a smart musician and actor whose young age and extreme dedication to this role heightens the entire work’s impact. \nPacific Opera Project’s innovative takes on the classics From Captain Kirk belting out Mozart as he battles Klingons in the Hollywood Hills, to a bearded lady’s appearance in a modern telling of Stravinsky’s Rake’s Progress at Occidental College, Pacific Opera Project’s fresh takes on the classics are consistently affordable, hysterical and terrific fun. I wrote about what makes this company so special last month , but my favorite POP memory from this year was watching my sister and brother-in-law experience their first live opera at the company’s recent “Barber of Seville” at the Ebell Club in Highland Park. Featuring a ridiculous set, simple piano accompaniment and talented cast, this production was campy and over the top, and we laughed until we cried. POP’s next performance — of Donizetti’s L’elisir d’amore in February — also will run at the historic Ebell Club. You can snag tickets and a table for four (with a bottle of wine and a spread of snacks) for $120. Not a bad way to accomplish your Los Angeles operatic New Year’s resolution.
