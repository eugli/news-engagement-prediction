Cuomo Kills Plastic Bag Fee, Calling it 'Deeply Flawed' By Leslie Albrecht | February 14, 2017 6:04pm View Full Caption Jody Reiss \nPARK SLOPE — Gov. Andrew Cuomo dashed environmental advocates' hopes of ridding the city of plastic shopping bags Tuesday by signing a bill that blocks a 5-cent fee on the bags. \nThe City Council approved the fee on plastic bags last year and it was supposed to go into effect Wednesday, but the Senate and Assembly both voted to halt the fee in recent weeks. \nCuomo could have vetoed the Legislature's move, but opted instead to let the fee die, calling it a \"deeply flawed\" idea in a lengthy statement released Tuesday. \nCuomo questioned why store owners would be allowed to keep the 5-cent fee, saying the money would be a \"$100 million windfall\" to merchants that should be used instead to \"solve the problem of plastic bags' environmental impact.\" \nCuomo said he'll form a statewide task force to come up with a plan for addressing the \"plastic bag problem.\" \nNew York City spends $12.5 million year sending some 9.37 billion bags to landfills, according to City Councilman Brad Lander, who co-sponsored the city's bag fee bill along with City Councilwoman Margaret Chin. \nLander and Chin said in a joint statement Tuesday that they were disappointed by Cuomo's move to kill the fee, noting that the fees have dramatically reduced bag use in other cities. \n\"Despite this loss, we are proud of the coalition we have built, which took the issue of plastic solid waste — over 9 billion plastic bags every year, adding up to 91,000 tons of solid waste, trucked through our neighborhoods to landfills, polluting our trees, parks, and oceans along the way — and raised it to the very highest levels of New York State government,” Lander and Chin said. \n\"Someday, not soon enough, but someday, we will win action to get rid of them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:54:38.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
