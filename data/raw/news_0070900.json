Not as a political commentator, conservative or “that girl from facebook.” She remarks that people like her family are struggling to survive right now thanks to the big meat packers and lobbyists who are replacing our beef with foreign meat. \nTomi feels we should care where our food is coming from. She explains that four big meat packing companies control over 83 percent of the industry which keeps livestock prices low and sometimes forces smaller ranchers out of business. Tomi states that most of our meat is now coming from overseas, and Americans should be able to eat imported meat if they choose to, but concerned consumers should also be able to easily find out the origin of their food. \nTo see more from Tomi, visit her channel on TheBlaze and watch full episodes of “Tomi” live weeknights from 7–8pm ET or anytime on-demand at TheBlaze TV .
