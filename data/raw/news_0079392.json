A former senior intelligence official told Fox News earlier this month that he suspects ex-CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper – among others – were connected to leaks. \nSome of those officials have pushed back. A Clapper spokesman, in a recent statement, appeared to distance the former intel boss from any leaks, voicing support for a probe while urging the new administration to take a sober approach to the investigation. \n“Leaks need to be investigated, but those investigations should be conducted in a manner that is not disparaging of our dedicated IC professionals, nor destructive to the entire community,” spokesman Shawn Turner said. \nBen Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser, also denied any involvement in leaks in an email to The Atlantic. \n“It’s totally absurd and doesn’t make any sense,” he wrote. \nBut the assertion that Obama – who began his political career as a community organizer – is actively aiding protests against Trump is new. Though, Trump added, it doesn’t necessarily bother him. \n“But I also understand that’s politics,” Trump said. “And in terms of him being behind things, that’s politics. And it will probably continue.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:57:23.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
