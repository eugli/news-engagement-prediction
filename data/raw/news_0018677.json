I did draw a quick conclusion I think that many others would, based on the circumstances,\" Clark told CHNL.\nShe did not offer an apology, however, and went on to repeat her party's claim that there is evidence tracing the alleged hack back to a computer IP address at the provincial legislature.\n\"We should all be concerned that, you know, somebody is trying to subvert our democratic process, just like what happened in the United States,\" she said.\nThe Liberals have not provided any evidence of the IP claim publicly. Staffers said it was discovered during an internal investigation into what happened.\nThe information that was allegedly hacked was gathered through a public consultation on Vancouver Island, but the NDP has maintained it was publicly accessible on the Liberals' website.\nThe opposition has also suggested the data was published publicly by the Liberals' own staff by accident.\nThe NDP said it's consulting a lawyer about Clark's accusation, and leader John Horgan has called on the premier to apologize to all British Columbians.\n\"When your leader thinks it's OK to pull things out of thin air for a few days and run with it, it's troubling,\" he said. \"It speaks to the premier's character.\"\nWith the provincial election looming, Clark is likely to face more questions about her credibility. James Lawson, a political scientist with the University of Victoria, said voters shouldn't be surprised to hear more unproven allegations during the campaign either.\n\"We shouldn't deceive ourselves in Canada… that somehow Canadians are too nice for this kind of politics,\" Lawson said.\nIt's unclear whether the Liberals have contacted the RCMP about the alleged hack. Communications staffer Emil Scheffel said the party was preparing a police report Monday, but the Liberals did not respond to CTV News’ repeated questions about the status of that report Thursday.\nB.C.'s Privacy Commissioner has confirmed it was notified about an alleged breach of the Liberals' website.\nWith a report from CTV Vancouver's Bhinder Sajan   \nRelated Stories Allegation that BC Liberals' website was hacked 'embarrassing': NDP Christy Clark dials back stunning hacking allegation against NDP Photos B.C.
