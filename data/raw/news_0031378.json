Photo: Daniel Munoz \nMayors from Hunters Hill, Strathfield, Ku-ring-gai, Mosman and Woollahra all confirmed their councils would not abandoned their legal challenges, which are due to be heard in the coming weeks and months. \nHowever, Lane Cove and North Sydney councils will vote to decide whether to maintain their appeals at council meetings on Monday. \nIn North Sydney, where residents will soon go to the polls for the North Shore by-election, mayor Jilly Gibson said was now \"very despondent\" about the council's legal challenge, but acknowledged some her of fellow councillors did not share her view. \n\"The courts can't save North Sydney council. Only the premier Gladys Berejiklian can. There was one opportunity for our council to be saved and that was when Mike Baird stepped down and Gladys Berejiklian stood up.\" \n\"We'll really have to seek some advice and make a very carefully considered decision about whether or not we proceed.\" \nLane Cove mayor Deborah Hutchens was also circumspect about the council's ongoing attempt to fight the merger with Ryde and Hunters Hill councils. \n\"I've got very mixed feelings today, following what happened yesterday,\" she said. \"Is it worth pushing through. Is it worth fighting?\" \nHowever, in Mosman Council, opposition to the proposed merger with North Sydney and Willoughby councils remains unequivocal, Mayor Peter Abelson said. \n\"In Mosman Council, every single council resolution on whether to take legal action has been unanimous. There is complete solidarity we should be taking these steps.\" \nThe legal challenges will also add to the uncertainty over when council elections can be held. \nOn Tuesday, Ms Berejiklian said she wanted all pending councils to hold elections by council elections by March 2018. \nBut the appeals for Mosman, North Sydney and Lane Cove are set down for April, with a judgment expected to delay any decision by weeks or even months, leaving a small window to achieve Ms Berejiklian's timeline. \n\"The whole thing gets very messy. To claim uncertainty is finished is a big claim,\" Cr Abelson said. \nAggrieved mayors also took aim at the premier's concession that a \"one-size fits all approach for NSW\" was the wrong approach, and one which had failed to appreciate the differences between the city and country. \nKu-ring-gai mayor Jennifer Anderson said a similar blanket rule had been applied to the city councils. \n\"Clearly, a one size fits all model across Sydney is equally problematic in our case,\" Cr Anderson said, noting that the council had no intention of abandoning its Supreme Court Appeal which begins on Thursday, \nShe said the proposed merger with Hornsby would force together \"quite different communities of interest\", with Hornsby Shire \"largely rural and river land\" whereas Ku-ring-gai is an urban area with strong links to the city.
