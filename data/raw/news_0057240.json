This would in turn see its debt fall. \nRome has already committed to adopt new measures. The new warning is meant to put pressure on Italy to deliver on its promises. \nA disciplinary decision would only be taken, a Commission's note said, after Brussels has all data available for its next economic forecasts, which are expected in May. \nA sanction procedure could end up with hefty fines, although this has so far never happened. It would, however, send a warning to markets which have already started to ask higher yields for Italian bonds.
