But without revealing any major spoilers for you non-book-readers, suffice it to say that Jamie and Claire Fraser will not be spending all of next season in the foggy fields of Scotland. They are, in fact, headed to South Africa. To learn why (or, in fact, how these time-traveling, star-crossed lovers find each other again), you’ll have to tune in to Season 3 when it returns in September 2017. Even without any huge revelations about how the Frasers have traveled through time and space to see each other, this video from stars Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan is a joy to behold, mostly for the sheer, giddy chemistry these friends exude on screen. Fans will, yes, have to endure a bit of separation at the beginning of Season 3 as Claire and Jamie go their own ways, thanks to the quirk of time travel that tore them apart at the end of Season 2. Calling in from the set in Scotland late last year, Heughan told Vanity Fair that being apart from Balfe was like “having a death in the family. Well, I don’t know. I mean, it’s just like a different show. It’s hard to separate yourself from the character. It’s always hard when we’re apart, actually, because she’s a great person, great to come to work with, and a very good actress. But I think it all adds to the reunion—if there’s a reunion, or when there’s a reunion—well, you know there’s one in the books. It should be very special.” Balfe jokingly responded , “Och! He’s already killed me in his mind. Gone. Too sad.” Balfe also had a little insight about what Claire will be wearing as she and Jamie set sail for South Africa: “ Outlander costumer Terry [Dresbach] came up with this great, fun idea for the costume that Claire takes back to the 17th century with her. That’s much more traditional. It melds both the Parisian world with the Scottish world a little bit, but it’s going to be very different to other seasons. In Season 3, I think I have one costume for the back end. Before, I had 17, 18, 19 different looks. It gets quite simplified towards the end, because we obviously go on a ship.” Sadly, Balfe confirms, she will not be going full pirate. “I don’t think that’s what we were going for, but that would be quite funny if I just showed up with a patch and a parrot.” In the video above, Balfe and Heughan joke that they will be able to ditch a few layers of costume once they leave the harsh climate of Scotland for the sunnier shores of South Africa—but fans can also read something a little more risqué into that statement if they like. In response to the general outcry over the lack of sex between the somewhat stressed and estranged Frasers in Season 2, Balfe promised: “I think the reunion and everything that’s going to happen once Jamie and Claire see each other, I think it’s really special. Maybe [fans will] have to wait a little bit, but I don’t think the sex going to be as scarce as last season, shall we say.” The third season of Outlander —which will include 13 episodes based upon Voyager , the third of eight books in Diana Gabaldon’s best-selling series—will premiere in September. Fans eager to get an early taste can also catch the Outlander panel at San Diego Comic Con this summer.
