But all signs point to Simmons getting on the court before the end of the season. Part of that assessment comes from Simmons' ramped up participation in both team practices and workouts, evidence of which has been recorded by beat writers and displayed on Simmons' own social media channels. \nRELATED : LeBron James and Ben Simmons Are Getting After It in the Gym Together \nSimmons' latest sneak peek into his training process comes in a video he posted to Instagram showing the Australia native getting after it on the VersaClimber at the 76ers' practice facility. This workout tool happens to be a favorite of LeBron James, who is not only signed to the same agency as Simmons, but spent time working out with him last summer. Perhaps the Cavs star passed on some of his training habits, too. \nIt's still uncertain when Simmons will return, if at all, and the 76ers have been mum on the topic; but from the looks of it, Simmons is more than ready. It appears his team is being extra cautious with one of its franchise centerpieces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:07:30.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
