Sessions was confirmed Wednesday with a 52-47 vote, vowing in his subsequent speech to \"defend the lawful orders\" of former Apprentice host Donald J. Trump. But accusations of racism aren&apos;t the only potential shortcomings of Sessions, as anyone currently reading this whilst packing a bowl in the Bible Belt already knows. Sessions is also staunchly anti-weed .\nRelated Here's the Coretta Scott King Letter About Jeff Sessions the Senate Doesn't Want You to Hear Jeff Sessions Confirmed as U.S. Attorney General MIT Professor Says Republicans Are Threatening Humanity Frank Cikutovich, an attorney in the weed-friendly city of Spokane, told the Spokesman Review Wednesday that Sessions&apos; previous comments on marijuana should (unfortunately) be taken seriously. \"He could not be more clear about what his position is,\" Cikutovich said. \"Unfortunately, he has the power to â€¦ say from this moment, &apos;We will start enforcing the federal law to the letter.&apos;\" This stance, of course, could put booming businesses in states like Washington in peril.\nSessions, while seemingly performing a belated O Brother, Where Art Thou audition, infamously said in 2016 that \"good people don&apos;t smoke marijuana.\" At the same Senate hearing that April, Sessions also declared weed to be a \"very real danger.\" Damn. Sounds like someone needs to smoke some goddamn weed .\nIn an emailed statement to Complex Wednesday night, National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) political director Justin Strekal outlined the fears of weed-legal states under an attorney general like Sessions. \"Jeff Sessions&apos; views are out of step with mainstream America and they are in conflict with the laws regarding marijuana in over half of the states in this country,\" Strekal said.\nMarijuana policy, Strekal explained, is \"at the forefront\" of voters&apos; minds and should be respected as such. \"We will never stop fighting for further marijuana reforms at the state level and much needed federal policy changes,\" he said. \"With Americans throughout the country organizing and taking action, the fight for cannabis freedom will continue with renewed energy.\" Notably, Sessions was also given a failing grade in NORML&apos;s 2016 Congressional Report Card.\nTags: News , Videos , Alabama , Donald Trump , Marijuana , Republicans , Weed , opinion , Jeff Sessions", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsDyc38MstQ", "http://www.youtube.com/user/complexmagazine?sub_confirmation=1", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fXt5V4W5-E", "http://twitter.com/tracecowen", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/18/that-time-the-senate-denied-jeff-sessions-a-federal-judgeship-over-accusations-of-racism/?utm_term=.2ab08a715a66", "http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/02/sen_jeff_sessions_being_sworn.html", "http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/feb/08/ag-nominee-jeff-sessions-could-send-washingtons-ma/", "http://norml.org/"], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:39:33.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
