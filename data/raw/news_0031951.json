To avoid getting your feelings squashed by all the couples in love around you, it’s necessary to have a definite plan. So, we tell you how you can plan Valentine's Day better if you are in a long-distance relationship . 1. Start Off With A Simple ‘I Love You’ Call Thinkstock \nDon’t mess this one up. Pick up your phone and let your significant other know what you mean to them. There’s no better feeling in the world than hearing those three letters first thing on Valentine’s Day and it’d put you on a nice pedestal for the rest of the day. 2. Don’t Make Each Other Feel Miserable By Discussing Your Friends’ Plans © Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images \nThe more you discuss about other couples, the more you sabotage your own plans. So, take our word for it and don’t start a discussion over how your roommate is spending this Valentine’s. Instead, try and make an effort to ensure that the focus of every discussion is your relationship and how you would love to make it special for each other. 3. Take Out Time For Hand-Written Notes And Deliver Them By Mail This Valentine’s Weekend Thinkstock \nDon’t be a lazy ass and instead try to make a genuine effort by making hand-written notes. If you can make it a surprise and deliver those notes through his/her friends at different times during the day, then there’s nothing better than that. It’s a sureshot way to let your significant other know how much you care. 4. Plan The Whole Day And Try Out A Movie Marathon On Phone © Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images \nBrowse the romance section under Netflix and try out a movie marathon over phone. There are plenty of titles there to keep the mood light and you can actually talk about a lot of other stuff while avoiding feeling alone on V-Day. 5. Stop Cribbing About The Distance And Arrange For A Virtual Dinner Date © Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images \nE-Dates are actually easier and hassle-free, thanks to Skype. Order food that both of you like, put on some music and switch on your webcam to make the best of this situation. Distance is temporary and don’t let it dictate terms of your relationship. 6. Talk And Plan About the Time When You Actually Get To Meet Each Other © Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images \nBeing away can be hard and Valentine’s Day gives a perfect opportunity to make plans in advance for when you get to meet each other. Girls love to talk and plan stuff in advance, and it’s actually a good way to spend quality time with her even if you are seven seas away. 7. And If All Of This Is Too Mediocre , Then Plan A Surprise Visit And Sweep Her Off Her Feet Thinkstock \nNow, some of you might be looking for a next-level idea for this Valentine’s Day and it can’t get any bigger than this. If you are just fed-up with all the miles in-between and can actually afford it, then go ahead and make the trip.
