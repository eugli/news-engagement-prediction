PA 1 of 12 Issued by the Supreme Court of (top row, from the left) Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance, Lord Kerr, Lord Sumption, (bottom row, from the left) Lady Hale, Lord Clarke, Lord Wilson and Lord Hodge, who agreed with the majority decision that the Government could not trigger Article 50 without Parliamentary approval. \n“People who say there will be no economic impact of leaving other than a kind of ‘happy pills for all’ are delusional.” \nHe added: “The language of the debate, polarised between catastrophe and liberation, is part of the problem. GETTY Ex-EU Commissioner Lord Hill speaks out about Remoaners \n“For me a catastrophe was the Black Death or the Second World War.” \nIt comes as Theresa May faces another legal challenge from the High Court with a judge being told MPs must vote on leaving the European Economic Area (EAA). GETTY Theresa May faces a fresh challenge from the HIgh Court Brexit is not a disaster like the Black Death or Second World War Lord Hill \nThe Government will welcome comments from Lord Hill and Sir Paul Marshall, a hedge fund chief and ex-Brussels official, who is co-organising a conference for leaders from British universities, finance, business, industry and trade. \nSir Paul said: “I go into the business world and people are just getting on with it. And that’s what we need to do for the country. \n“My motive in organising this conference was to bring a lot of people from finance, universities, manufacturing togetherwho are focusing on the opportunities that lie ahead”. \nLord Hill said he was “obsessed by the fact that we should be putting our intellectual capacity in Whitehall, in politics, in business, in universities, into thinking about the future and thinking as well about some of the things the British government could do to enable business to flourish”. \nThe new legal row comes just a week after the Supreme Court ruled only an Act of Parliament could take the UK out of the EU.
