The LeEco Le Pro3 is the company’s flagship handset, while the Le S3 is their mid-range offering. Both of these phones were introduced in the US a while back, following their launch in Asia, and both are quite affordable, actually. That being said, this new update brings a number of changes, and the biggest one is the addition of the app drawer, read on. \nMost of you are quite probably most interesting in the app drawer icon, well, it has been added in this update and it is placed above the apps dock, just above the ‘home’ button. LeEco has also improved the Le S3’s camera to an extent, it is now able to do much better in low-light, according to the company, and there’s even a photo included down below in order to prove that. The LeEco Le Pro3, in specific, can now take better HDR images, as LeEco improved HDR photo processing on the device, and the phone will now capture such photos quicker as well. The company has improved a fingerprint scanner on both devices, so that the devices will now vibrate only once if the fingerprint scanner does not pick up your fingerprint properly. Parental Control functions have been added, and the streaming has been improved in the LE app. Bluetooth is now far more reliable it seems, and the company has also increased Wi-Fi download speeds with this update when using both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, though this latter improvement applies only to the Le S3. \nThat’s pretty much it as far as new features and improvements are concerned. LeEco said that this update will be rolling out to both devices over the next couple of days, so if you don’t have auto updates enabled, you should go in your settings menu and check if the update is available manually, of course. In case you’d like to know more about each of these smartphones, we’ve already reviewed both the LeEco Le Pro3 and Le S3 , and if you’d like to take a look at LeEco’s official press release regarding this update, follow the source link down below.
