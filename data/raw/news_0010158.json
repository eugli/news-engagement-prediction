Ad Feedback \n\"Not only that, but New Zealand also has a strong used import sector, that affects depreciation rates,\" says Motor Industry Association chief executive David Crawford. \n\"So my opinion is you've got to take the study's results with a grain of salt. I'd pitch our depreciation rates somewhere between USA and Australia.\" \nBut if the depreciation rates suggested by the study are true, these are what some of our most popular new vehicles should be worth after four years of average use: \nToyota Corolla GX hatch: $33,590 RRP, $15,562. \nKia Sportage LX AWD: $41,990 RRP, $19,453. \nMazda CX-5 GLX: $39,745 RRP, $18,413. \nHyundai Tucson 2WD: $42,990 RRP, $19,917. \nSuzuki Swift GLX: $23,990 RRP, $11,114. \nHolden Commodore SV6: $55,990 RRP, $24,940. \nMitsubishi Outlander XLS AWD: $47,490 RRP, $22,002. \nNissan Qashqai Ti: $43,990 RRP, $20,380. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:56:03.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
