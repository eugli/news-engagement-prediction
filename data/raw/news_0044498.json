Photo: supplied. All this week we're featuring King Gizzard's Flying Microtonal Banana . Subtitled 'Explorations Into Microtonal Tuning, Vol. 1' it's the Melbourne band's ninth album in five years and the first of several LPs the band have plotted for 2017.So what else is up the wizard's sleeve of this restlessly creative ensemble? triple j got some tasty album teasers while chatting with the band about Flying Microtonal Banana . Here's the TL;DR skinny: expect Gregorian chant and a 21-track narrated opus. You might've caught the band performing 'Nuclear Fusion' live at Laneway and seen guitarist Joe Walker pulling off that pitch-shifted intro on-stage and wondered if there's some vocal trickery going on. Nope, it's au naturale.\" We weren't using a vocoder. I can do really bad Gregorian throat singing ,\" Joe says; \" …I gotta get my shit together and practise that - it takes its toll .\" Practising for what? Bandmate Stu Mackenzie adds: \" There's going to be quite a lot of throat singing in our next record, actually. It sounds like we're being sarcastic but it's true. \"Stu also spoke about another future LP that's really gonna tickle the 'Gizzverse' theorists and sounds like a spiritual successor to the band's second album: the psychedelic spaghetti western audiobook Eyes Like The Sky .\" We're actually making this record at the moment which is completely narrated throughout but it's not related to Eyes Like The Sky at all. It's kind of more related to Nonagon Infinity but it's three distinct stories… kind of short stories that interlink but don't follow in a linear sense. I think it's going to be 21 tracks, so a lot of shorter pieces… \"\" It's Eyes Like the Sky-esque in the sense that it's narrated and visual but it's not really that kind of music ,\" says Stu.\" Like the worst nightmare of Eyes Like The Sky - it's pretty dark ,\" adds King Gizz's Harmonica-wielding vocalist Ambrose Kenny-Smith. Ambrose's father, Broderick Smith, wrote and narrated Eyes Like The Sky : telling the tale of savage anti-hero Miguel O'Brien slaughtering his way to freedom in the Wild West. While King Gizz don't have immediate plans for a sequel, Papa Smith has designs on continuing the adventures of the character. \" Dad has written the sequel to Eyes Like The Sky anyway. We'll get there; he wanted to take Miguel O'Brien to the Middle East… \"Stu chimes in: \" I think he's going to go to India and help build the railways there, maybe learn a bit of Kung Fu. It's going to get a bit funky I think further on .\" posted 20/02/2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:36:26.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
