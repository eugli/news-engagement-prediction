(PTI) \nCaretaker Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerselvam was never loyal to the party, his opponent and AIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala said on Monday, alleging he was removed by the party because he was too close to opposition DMK. \nSpeaking to cadre and media in Chennai, Sasikala alleged many were scheming to break the AIADMK when she was busy arranging for late CM Jayalalithaa’s final rites, an indirect reference to Paneerselvam.

But several leaders from her faction have joined OPS in the past two days.
