Watch | Kellyanne Conway: I'm not a feminist in the classic sense 01:18 \nI n a letter to the Washington DC Office of Disciplinary Counsel they listed occasions on which they argued Mrs Conway had \"brought shame upon the legal profession\" and engaged in \"dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\". \nThey cited as an example her references in a TV interview to the \"Bowling Green Massacre\" to justify Mr Trump's executive order banning immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries . \n\"Not only was there no 'massacre' in Bowling Green, Kentucky (or Bowling Green, New York for that matter) but Ms Conway knew there was no massacre,\" the professors said. \nThe complaint also accused Mrs Conway of making a \"false statement that President Obama had 'banned' Iraqi refugees from coming into the United States for six months following the 'Bowling Green massacre'.\" Watch | Kellyanne Conway 'counselled' after promoting Ivanka Trump's products on TV 00:39 \nT he letter said that was a \"clear violation of government ethics rules about which a lawyer and member of the Bar should surely know\". \nThe professors added: \"We do not file this complaint lightly. We believe that at one time Ms Conway understood her ethical responsibilities as a lawyer and abided by them. \n\"But she is currently acting in a way that brings shame upon the legal profession. She is a lawyer and her conduct, clearly intentionally violative of the rules that regulate her professional status, cries out for sanctioning by the DC Bar.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T13:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:18:32.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
