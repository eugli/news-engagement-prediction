Ron Lewis, who had been a three-star general and top aide to the then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter, used his government credit card at strip clubs in Rome and Seoul, drank in excess and had 'improper interactions' with women during business travel, a military investigation concluded. Lewis, an attack helicopter pilot who served in the Army for 30 years, was reprimanded by General Daniel Allyn, the vice chief of the Army, but will not face any fines, Fox News reports. Ron Lewis, a top aide to the then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter, has been demoted and will retire as a one-star general as a result of a scandal that involved gentlemen's clubs and booze The demotion will cost him $10,000 a year in pension payments, USA Today reports. Lewis had reached the three-star rank of lieutenant general while working for Carter, but was demoted to major general after he was fired in November 2015 after allegations of an improper relationship with a female subordinate. The Defense Department Inspector General's devastating 50-page report last October showed that Lewis spent more than $1,100 on alcohol in April 2015 during a visit to the Candy Bar in Seoul and lied to have it expunged from his government-issued credit card. Lewis had reached the three-star rank of lieutenant general while working for Carter The Candy Bar is located in an area of Seoul the report calls 'Hooker Hill', deemed off limits for US military personnel. When questioned about the charge in April 2015, Lewis denied that it was his and the Pentagon gave him a new credit card. Six months later, Lewis ran up another bill, this time for $1,755 at the Cica Cica Boom club in Rome, the report said.
