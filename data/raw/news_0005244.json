In fact, we encourage and we celebrate the results of this incredible Reddit Photoshop battle. Thank you for spreading this happy corgi everywhere it seemed appropriate, and even some places where it wasn't appropriate. We first travel to Spain, where this pupper is about to teach some bulls how actual running is done. \nImage: stupidphotoshop/reddit This pup is so photogenic that Reddit made it the spokesdog for its new dog food. \nImage: KrombopulosJeff/Reddit Someone imagined this puppy as the next city-wrecking monster. With a face like that, we should just let him do it. \nImage: ]workingat7/reddit His cuteness is so overwhelming, even cheetahs can't handle it. \nImage: useingatlin/reddit This doggo is also active in the community, doing his part to promote equality for all. \nImage: albo_underhill/reddit You never know what cute beasts live deep in the desert. \nImage: AttackPony/reddit We would risk the zombies to pet this pup. \nImage: ]smudgyboar/reddit This corgi truly loves everyone, even letting Putin hitch a ride. \nImage: gnostic_cat/reddit With a smile like that, this pup is ready for Hollywood. He looks right at home in Forrest Gump. \nImage: goodboyotis/Reddit ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:03:18.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
