Akeredolu and his deputy, Agboola Ajayi, will take their oaths at the Akure Township Stadium. Yesterday’s handing over at the Cocoa Conference Hall was attended by officials of the outgoing and incoming administrations. Akeredolu said: “Today is not about speech making, speech will be made tomorrow (today). “We are here for a short ceremony, the governor and other members of the team who are responsible for this seamless transition have done well. “I remember on one occasion that the governor told me that the swearing-in is a state affair and that the state cannot afford to fail. “I must admit your efforts in ensuring that we have a seamless transition. The team led by Jide Olujuyigbe has been very cooperative. “I have said it once, and I will repeat, you have done your best and I am sure you have satisfied yourself. “The moment that satisfaction comes, you go to bed knowing that you have handed over to another person. “I know the task is not something you can take for granted, the governor and I have discussed. I know it is not going to be rosy, you have done your bit, history, no doubt, will judge you. “It is left for me to do my best. All we want to do is to serve this state, let us serve this state. The outgoing commissioners, we will need your help, just help your state with your service anytime we need you, you are not helping Aketi , you are helping your state with your service once more.” Mimiko said he had no doubt that he was handing over the state into safe hands. His words: “ It is only one that God favours who will live to see a day like this and be the beneficiary of a day like this. “ Aketi and I are soulmates, way back in Ife (University of Ife). I have no doubt in my heart that the state is in good hands with you as governor. “I pray that this spirit of cooperation will continue in our state as government will witness seamless transition. “I pray to God to help you so to sustain the peace in this state. “It is one of the major achievements of this administration in eight years.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:47:41.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
