She could not describe the severity of the injuries or say whether the staff members sought medical attention. \nOfficials contacted the student’s parents, Ms. Pugh said, and he was taken home. \nShe did not provide the name, age or grade of the student. She also would not say whether the student will face disciplinary action. \nA witness who called the Post-Gazette said nine city police cars came to the school, and a short time later a student was led out in handcuffs. Ms. Pugh said the student was detained, but she could not confirm whether he was placed in handcuffs. \nA spokeswoman for Pittsburgh police referred questions to the school district. \nAndrew Goldstein: or 412-263-1352.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:56:03.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
