And yet, so much about the year ahead for him is cloaked in unfamiliarity. \nPeralta has no guarantee of a starting job. He's no longer viewed as the solution at shortstop. There are questions about whether his offensive decline in 2016 had at least something to do with expected age regression. And there's the nearing uncertainty about his baseball future. \nâ€¢ Spring Training: Info | Tickets | Schedule | Gear \nPeralta enters the final season of a four-year contract with the Cardinals in murkier waters than when he started in 2014. He was signed then to stabilize things at short, which Peralta did from 2014-15. He was to be the Cardinals' shortstop again in 2016 until a thumb injury during the spring left Peralta sidelined until June. \nThe scars lingered much longer.

Going to third base so quickly, that was tough. The swing, sometimes it would not feel right. But I learned from last year. I feel different now.\" \nIt started with regaining full strength in his surgically repaired thumb, and that came with weeks of rest during the offseason. Understanding his fit defensively has also allowed Peralta to tailor his spring to prepare for the demands ahead. Those practice reps he couldn't get midseason are now a focus during workouts. \nWith six-plus weeks to prepare, Peralta hopes to show that he's the right fit for the position. Jedd Gyorko is also in the mix for starting consideration.

In fact, this is the first spring in which he has ordered a third baseman's glove since 2010. \nThe Cardinals always envisioned the possibility that third base could be a better fit for Peralta as he aged. The position doesn't require the same side-to-side range as shortstop, and the decreased reaction time shouldn't be an issue for Peralta, who will be 35 in May. \n\"The majority of work he's doing right now is to make sure he's moving well,\" manager Mike Matheny said. \"He's healthy. He's swinging the bat well. And he's going to take as many ground balls [as he needs] to feel comfortable on the infield.\" \nProduction at the plate will factor into the Cardinals' third-base decision, and Peralta does have something to prove after an uneven offensive season. He finished with a .260/.307/.408 slash line and his lowest OPS (.715) since joining the organization in 2014. \nAs for Peralta's future, the long-term outlook is nebulous. \n\"Hopefully, I can play for a couple more years,\" he said. \"I feel my body can do that. If I can play a couple more years, I'd be happy.\" has covered the Cardinals for MLB.com since 2012, and previously covered the Pirates from 2007-11.
