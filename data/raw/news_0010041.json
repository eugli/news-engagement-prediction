Authorities said that Rhodes, who is already a registered sex offender, was taken into custody on January 25 during a disorderly protest against President Donald Trump. Micah Rhodes detained, taken away in squad car near SW corner of pioneer square #portlandprotest pic.twitter.com/v3DmpRHCUM \n— Dave Killen (@killendave) January 25, 2017 \nAfter interviews with Portland Police Bureau officers, Rhodes allegedly admitted to having sex with an underage male and an underage female, but said he didn’t know their ages until after he had engaged in the sexual activity. But police said when they contacted the alleged victims, both of them contradicted Rhodes’ story, claiming he knew they were minors before the sexual acts occurred. \nAccording to KOIN , Rhodes allegedly admitted during a follow-up interview that he probably knew the victims were 17 before the crimes took place. Police records stated that after meeting the underage male on the dating website Grindr and learning his age, Rhodes told the boy he was concerned about their activity together because “he has [a] sex crime history and would get in trouble.” \nWhile he was a juvenile, Rhodes had to register as a sex offender when he was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse and first-degree sodomy, according to court records. Because he was a juvenile at the time of conviction, further details are not available and his previous case was settled in juvenile court. \nRhodes was arraigned on Monday in Portland where he pleaded not guilty via video appearance. His bail was set at $20,000 and his next court date is February 7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:15:55.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
