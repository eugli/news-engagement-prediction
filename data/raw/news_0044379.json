'I refuse to be a struggling artist trying to make it' \nFlorence, who has never been scared to voice her opinion, took to Twitter on Monday to lambaste the organisers of the upcoming Marula Jazz and Gospel Music Festival for including American R&B singer Syleena Johnson on the bill. I don't see why the Marula Festival needs Syleena Johnson or any other overseas act. We need to get over this obsession. https://t.co/qTFR8wUd3F — Mme a Masakona (@FloMasebe) February 20, 2017 It's so unnecessary. https://t.co/BCYs8uVCC9 — Mme a Masakona (@FloMasebe) February 20, 2017 \nShe went on to suggest that the government may have scored an \"own goal\" by supporting the festival. Such an own goal this. All those logos at the bottom but 1 have zero business paying to bring Syleena Johnson to this festival. pic.twitter.com/3EZ3la5VAB — Mme a Masakona (@FloMasebe) February 20, 2017 I don't even know. I'm just bothered by what is a wholly government supported festival spending to get her here. We need to grow up. https://t.co/NgHIUsLjYO — Mme a Masakona (@FloMasebe) February 20, 2017 \nFlorence's plea for people to put the focus on local talent and not international acts has been repeated several time by artists in Mzansi. \nIn 2015, rapper AKA hit back at US musician Ace Hood's headline performance in South Africa by shading him on Twitter and suggesting that Ace should instead be the supporting act for the more popular local musicians.
