I actually missed it in real time because award shows nowadays run 7 hours and I needed to get my beauty sleep. Many people are saying it was the biggest blunder in Oscars history. That’s all fine and dandy but the real story from this weekend should be how John Mulaney and Nick Kroll absolutely CRUSHED their monologue at the Spirit Awards. You won’t find a funnier 9 minutes and 44 seconds. I honestly can’t even come up with the right combination of adjectives to describe how awesome that monologue is. You really have to watch it and experience it for yourself. Jokes on jokes on jokes on jokes. Just ripping the room apart. The Steve Bannon stuff was great but I don’t think I’ve ever laughed as hard at a joke as I did when Mulaney talked about Shia LaBeouf taking a hard left turn in his car. Real tears rolling down my face. I’m a big fan of Mulaney’s stand up and Kroll has always been a funny dude but holy shit. Jimmy Kimmel did well last night but let these two host every award show going forward.
