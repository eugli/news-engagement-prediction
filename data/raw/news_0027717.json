(Photo: Sumisha Naidu) A \nKUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia and Singapore authorities have thwarted four syndicates behind an \"Africa scam\", where more than 100 victims - mostly women - suffered total losses exceeding S$6.4 million in fake online relationships. \nThirty-four people have been arrested in various states, 13 of whom were Nigerians, according to the authorities on Monday (Feb 13). Malaysia's Commercial Crimes Department and Singapore's Commercial Affairs Department said they successfully cracked down on the \"Africa scam\". (Photo: Sumisha Naidu) The scammers got to know their victims in Singapore and Malaysia through social media , usually under the pretext of entering a relationship. At some point along the way, the scammers would tell their victims they were sending them gifts or even coming to visit them. That was when things would go wrong - the victims would be asked to transfer money to bank accounts supposedly belonging to customs or immigration to secure the release of the gifts or the person themselves. David Chew from Singapore Commercial Affairs Department said: \"These guys are on the internet, posing as doctors, professionals, making friends with people around the world. The third one is once I become good friends with you, I can ask you to make investments, to give me loans. Of course, they never intend to return the money and when it's time for them to pay back the money, they're suddenly uncontactable. The modalities in which I can cheat a person who I trust is multifaceted.\" Singapore's Commercial Affairs Department on the modus operandi of these scammers.
