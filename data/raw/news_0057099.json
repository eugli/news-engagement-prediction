A young boy who became a viral sensation earlier this month when he told a local newsman that he wanted to be interviewed by Lester Holt instead actually got to meet the NBC Nightly News anchor Tuesday. \n“Finally I got to meet Jaden!” Holt tweeted this afternoon, adding a photo of him and his young fan posing at his desk. “He paid a visit to our newsroom today. Great kid. His airport interview still makes me smile.” \nThe precocious 7-year first made headlines a few weeks ago when he was interviewed at Portland International Airport by KGW reporter Drew Carney while waiting for a flight to California to go to Disneyland. Unfamiliar with Carney’s work, Jaden told him, “I was wondering, I didn’t really see you on TV that much. Lester Holt? Usually you see him more on the news than you.” \nAfter repeatedly walking away from an amused Carney, Jaden added that he’d like to meet Holt and “see all the things he has reported.” \nFortunately for Jaden, he and his family were in New York today, and Holt arranged a visit to NBC Studios. While there, Jaden toured the studio, learned how to operate the cameras and read from the teleprompter, and sat in the director’s chair. An avid violin player, he also performed for Holt, who returned the favor by showing the boy some tips on the electric bass. A brief segment about the visit will air on Nightly News tonight. Finally finally I got to meet Jaden! He paid a visit to our newsroom today. Great kid. His airport interview still makes me smile. pic.twitter.com/duSRSy0bUh \n— Lester Holt (@LesterHoltNBC) February 21, 2017 Show Full Article ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:17:21.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
