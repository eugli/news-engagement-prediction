The moment everything is done, arrests shall take place.”\nOn Wednesday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the fake currency.\n“A Prime Minister who can’t even print notes properly; how can he run the country? He has reduced the whole nation into a laughing stock,” the Aam Aadmi Party leader tweeted.\nRohit, a customer care executive who got the notes, reported the matter to the police.\nIn his complaint, Rohit said he tried to withdraw Rs8,000 at around 7.45pm from the ATM at the T-Point at Tigri in Sangam Vihar but all the four 2,000 rupee notes turned out to be fake.\nAfter informing the ATM guard posted there, he made an official complaint to the police which sent a sub-inspector to the ATM.\nThe sub-inspector withdrew another 2,000 rupee note from the ATM which too turned out to be similarly fake, after which the police registered an FIR.\nA case of cheating and related offences has been filed against unknown persons under sections 489-b, 489-e and 420 of the Indian Penal Code, the police said. Experts say it is possible for an ATM to dispense even a simple sheet of paper if its size is the same as the currency notes.\n“Technically, yes. ATMs are not equipped to read the security features of notes. Only the size needs to be the same,” K.
