Photo: PA \nA single mum from Shipley is celebrating winning £14.5million in the EuroMillions draw. \nBev Doran, 37, from Shipley, was one of three lottery jackpot winners to scoop multimillion-pound windfalls. \nShe gave up work two years ago to look after her children, two of whom have autism, and said her first priority will be to move from her council house to a bigger home. \nShe celebrated by spraying prosecco - she's allergic to champagne - at a Bradford hotel, at the same time that best friends Paula Barraclough, 45, and Lorraine Smith, 54, from Tyne and Wear, were explaining how they won £7.6million each in Saturday's Lotto draw. \nHer daughter, five, and her youngest son, nine, have autism diagnoses and another son, 10, is also going through testing. Her oldest son is 17. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:05:48.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
