Government to pay for reburial \n\"We are upset the child's grave was disturbed and the child's body taken away with nothing being said to APY anthropologists or traditional owners,\" he said. \n\"We want protection for our heritage ... not people from Adelaide digging up old graves and taking away the bodies of our people without telling us. \n\"I have asked my solicitor to write to the coroner requesting an inquest.\" \nSouth Australia's Aboriginal Affairs Minister, Kyam Maher, has also called on the coroner to review policies around the removal of bones from sacred burial sites for examination. \n\"To avoid any future incident that may cause this type of distress,\" Mr Maher said. \nMr Maher said the Government would cover the costs of reburying the remains. Coroner says he was told bones might not be ancient \nCoroner Mark Johns said that he found out about the remains in December 2016, when he was contacted by forensic pathologist Roger Byard, who was in the cave at that time. \nMr Johns said Professor Byard reported the date of death may have been as recent as 10 years beforehand. \nThe coroner said that because of that and having been told there were Indigenous community members at the scene, who had alerted police and who appeared to support forensic examination, he authorised the removal of the bones. \nMr Johns said that it was not until 10 days later that he became aware of Mr Tjami's concerns and that he asked for a report from the police, which he said he still had not received. \nThe coroner said each case of removal of bones from sacred sites must be considered on its merits and \"it is not always possible to know the age of remains from a preliminary examination\". \n\"The circumstances of the finding of these remains certainly caused the police and Professor Byard to have reason to think the bones may not be Indigenous, nor that they were ancient,\" Mr Johns said. \n\"After proper examination of the remains, Professor Byard is now of the opinion that the remains were Indigenous.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:29:01.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
