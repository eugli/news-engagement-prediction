She was her father’s favourite and yet always had to play second fiddle to her older sister. She was expected to live a perfect existence and never let the side down. In Mustique, she was treated with respect but without the stuffy social strictures she faced back home. She used to get up quite late and then loved to picnic on the beach, which I would organise. Island life: Princess Margaret at Lord Glenconner's 50th. Basil said she was treated with respect but without stuffy social structures in Mustique There was no television and so she would do jigsaw puzzles, play the piano or read, swapping books with her guests. She knew everything that was happening in Mustique, and she was always the centre of attention, although so many other super-rich and famous people would be arriving daily on small planes, or in their luxurious yachts. It gave Mustique a mystique unlike anywhere else. PIPPA - MY PERFECT DOUBLES PARTNER The Middletons are regular visitors to Mustique and the first time I met them was on a tennis court. They’re a very athletic family and often asked me to join them for a game of doubles. And, believe me, they all play to win. Pippa, above, is a particularly strong player, so when I partner her at doubles we normally do pretty well. I would say she is more consistent than Kate. Prince William is quite steady, too. He and Kate used to play a lot more before they had children, sometimes showing up for the round-robin games which start at 5pm, when you just play with whoever is there. It may sound slightly surreal that you can turn up and find yourself playing with or against the future King and Queen, but that’s Mustique for you. I’m proud to call the Middletons my friends. They tend to spend most of their time on the island in whatever villa they are renting, but they come to the bar and seem to enjoy the ‘Wednesday Jump-up’, when a band flies over from St Vincent. I recently gave up control of Basil’s Bar, but have remained in an ambassadorial role. There aren’t many places where William and Kate can just get up and dance without being photographed. Perhaps William likes Mustique for the same reasons his great-aunt Princess Margaret did, a chance to be himself away from people watching his every move. His brother Harry only comes to Mustique when William is here. Their security people warn us when they are coming, and we set aside a table for them opposite the stage and dancefloor. They know lots of people, but no one bothers them. Like Mick Jagger, they are supportive of the Mustique Blues Festival, which supports the charity I’ve set up to help kids in St Vincent. I was pleased and a little surprised to be invited to William and Kate’s wedding at Westminster Abbey in 2011. It was a wonderful occasion, quite humbling. The Middleton family set up camp at the Goring Hotel in Victoria in the run-up to the wedding and afterwards, Jeremy Goring, the hotel’s owner, asked me what I thought about the idea of setting up a ‘pop-up’ Basil’s Bar a little while later. I was delighted, and made sure that I flew in for it. It was one Basil’s Bar celebration I was glad I did not have to organise — especially the bringing in of ten tons of white sand. I have no doubt William will make a fine king, but it depends on what Prince Charles wants to do. How long does he want to be King; when will he let his son take over? I think after ten or 15 years he should pass it on to William — it would be good to have a young King. William has been raised for the job and it would be sad if he has to wait until he becomes an old man before taking on the role. Over the years, I have found myself mixing with everyone from Mick Jagger and David Bowie to Lord Lichfield (the photographer) and three generations of royals. It is a world so different to that which I had grown up in — in a house that didn’t even have running water. I was just 24 and working behind the bar at the Cotton House Hotel when I met Colin Tennant, the future Lord Glenconner, in 1971. He’d bought the Caribbean island — part of the island chain of St Vincent and the Grenadines, reached via nearby Barbados or Saint Lucia — in 1958 for £45,000. We became great friends, this Old Etonian and me, and used to have breakfast, lunch and dinner together at the hotel. It was sometimes a volatile relationship. He had a famously explosive temper and there were times when I stood up to him — with violent results. Once, I was serving a guest at the beach bar, where I also worked for him. A rustic shack overlooking the small sandy beach that is Britannia Bay — named after the Queen’s visit in the Royal Yacht in 1966 — it would soon become known as Basil’s Bar, when I took it over. It was just before Colin’s 50th birthday celebrations. He came in and asked for a drink and I told him he would have to wait. Colin was so angry that he threw a glass of water over me — so I threw one back at him and then jumped over the bar and punched him. We didn’t talk to each other for a couple of days, despite Princess Margaret trying to intervene. Eventually, Colin asked me to come to his office, where he greeted me with an outstretched hand and said: ‘I don’t want to talk about the past. Let’s forget what happened. ‘I want you to help me with the bar and with my birthday party.’ Our backgrounds could not have been more different. I was from a poor family on St Vincent and my mother died when I was nine. I quit school at 14 to support my grandmother who brought me up. My parents were never married and my father, who was a fisherman, played little part in my childhood. Colin and Princess Margaret had an amazing relationship. She respected him and he respected her — he would do anything to make her happy. When she got engaged to society photographer Tony Armstrong-Jones (who later became Lord Snowdon) in 1960, Colin asked her if she would like ‘something in a small box from Aspreys, or a piece of Mustique’ as a wedding present. She chose the land and even made a detour to inspect it during her honeymoon on the Royal Yacht Britannia. That was the only time Snowdon, who died last month, ever set foot in ‘Mustake’ as he called it. I never met him, but I knew he always resented the wedding present because he saw it as a gift to the Princess rather than to them both. He frequently referred to Colin as ‘that s***’. Colin gave the Princess 12 acres on the south-west coast with spectacular views, just above Gelliceaux Bay where she later built Les Jolies Eaux (‘Beautiful Waters’), the only home she ever owned, and which meant more to her than a hundred palaces. He used to get very anxious before the Princess visited. Colin wanted it to be perfect, so to calm himself he used to sip vodka throughout the day. By the evening he had drunk quite a lot. I think in a different life Princess Margaret would have been a great actress. She loved to sing and dance and let her hair down — and when she was in the mood she could talk about anything. Where she loved to talk the most was in the sea. She would swim for hours, a slow breast stroke, chatting to whoever was around at the time. There was never anything sexual or even flirtatious between Princess Margaret and me. We were friends and I made her laugh. MY LOVE AFFAIR WITH BEAUTIFUL ARISTOCRAT While Colin Tennant played a role in Princess Margaret’s illicit love life, he also had a hand in a romance which changed my life. It began in the summer of 1975, when Colin invited Virginia Royston — Viscountess Royston — to a house he owned on Mustique called The Gingerbread. A former debutante of the year, Virginia had married Viscount ‘Pips’ Royston at a lavish ceremony in London. But five years later, he died from a rare heart condition at just 34, leaving his wife with two young children, Jemima, four, and Joe, two. Virginia Royston and barman Basil, who were together from 1975 until 1982 after meeting in Mustique During her visit, Colin invited Virginia for dinner at the Cotton House Hotel. I was seated across from her. She was absolutely stunning, with blonde hair and blue eyes. We were immediately attracted and began playing footsie under the table even before the main course arrived. After dinner, we sat with each other — and that was it. We fell deeply in love. She was 35, six years older than me, and she wrote me a letter every day when she returned to England. Soon she came to live with me in Mustique. It caused a scandal in the papers, but we just got on with it. We travelled a lot and at one time my two kids lived with us as well. They were close in age and went to the local school together with Virginia’s children. One year we went to Disney World in Orlando. We arrived in Miami and I handed over the six passports. The man couldn’t work it out. He said: ‘We have here a Basil Charles and two other Charleses [my children], a Viscountess Royston, a Viscount Royston [Viriginia’s son Joe] and a Lady Jemima Yorke [her daughter], what’s going on?’ I said: ‘It’s a British thing!’ I was with Virginia until 1982. She was a wonderful person, but started to drink too much. There was one occasion when we were invited to dinner with Princess Margaret. I went home to pick up Virginia, but found her so drunk she couldn’t walk. I couldn’t get her to sober up, so I went on my own. I apologised to the Princess for being late, although of course I did not tell her why. I tried everything to help Virginia, but in the end it was too much and she went to rehab. It didn’t work. Tragically, she died in 1988 aged just 46 from liver failure. Somehow, I became part of her circle. There is a famous photograph that Patrick Lichfield took of us all at Gelliceaux Bay in 1972. After a picnic one day we grouped ourselves around her under various parasols; she was seated in the middle wearing a bathing dress and looking happy. She was happy. Patrick told me shortly before he died that this one photograph made him more money than any other he had taken in his whole career. It was two years later, in March 1974, that we heard for the first time that a certain Roddy Llewellyn had been invited to stay at Les Jolies Eaux. Roddy was 26, 17 years Princess Margaret’s junior. He was a cute-looking boy, but I never saw the relationship as long-term. He was part of the escape for her. The Princess first met Roddy after he was recommended as a suitable ‘spare man’ for a weekend house party at Glen, Colin and his wife Anne’s estate near Innerleithen in the Scottish Borders. LEG WRESTLING WITH JERRY HALL In 1976, Mick Jagger decided to buy land on Mustique and build an Oriental-themed house on L’Ansecoy Bay. He has returned almost every year since and has been a great supporter of my annual fund-raising Blues Festival. Once, he invited me to his birthday party in the South of France, and if we are ever in New York at the same time we meet for a drink at the Carlyle Hotel. Jerry Hall (pictured with me) used to come to the island with her then lover Bryan Ferry, but after a while she wanted to be with the bigger star — and that was Mick. Jerry’s big thing was leg wrestling. You would lie down next to her on the beach, head to toe and wrestle just with your legs. She was the champion again and again. Once, in the Eighties, Mick came into Basil’s Bar and there was an acoustic singer with a harmonica on the stage. Mick just pulled up a chair and began singing with him. That wouldn’t happen anywhere else in the world. Anne, who had never met Roddy before, issued an invitation. She told him that his flight north would be taken care of and that he should report to the Cafe Royal, just off Edinburgh’s Princes Street, at 1pm sharp, where Margaret and her children would be having lunch after coming south from Balmoral. Colin always said the attraction between Margaret and Roddy was immediate, that she ‘devoured’ him at the lunch. In return, Roddy told Anne that he thought Margaret had the most beautiful eyes. ‘Tell her,’ Anne advised. And he did, later that weekend at Glen, where they played the piano together, lit each other’s cigarettes and made love for the first time. It was only on Mustique that Margaret and Roddy could truly relax away from the Press. But, ironically, it was here in what became my bar that a grainy picture of them in their bathing costumes was taken in March 1976. There were others there, but they were cropped out, providing the first intimate photo of the couple. It appeared in the News Of The World, igniting the scandal of the Queen’s sister and her much younger lover. It was the final straw for the Princess’s marriage. Margaret and Roddy never flaunted their relationship; they were discreet. I remember watching them, hand in hand on the beach, as if they were the only people in the world. Later that year, Princess Margaret returned to the island for Colin’s 50th birthday on December 1. Colin was a showman who believed that if you are giving a party you have to enjoy it the most, or no one else will. But I was the one who organised them. His birthday celebrations lasted almost a week, culminating in a gold-themed extravaganza on the white sands of Macaroni Beach, where young locals formed a guard of honour wearing gold-painted codpieces made from coconut shells, their bodies glistening with oil for dramatic effect. The trees and grass were sprayed gold and guests walked through arches of gold palms. Flaming torches lined the route to the beach, which itself was flooded in light with the help of a generator. Mick and Bianca Jagger, who in those days used to rent a house on the island, both wore gold and added an extra element of glamour. But it was Princess Margaret who, as guest of honour, stole the show in a gold-sequined turban and kaftan, with her skin darkened. She looked out of this world — but then she always did.
