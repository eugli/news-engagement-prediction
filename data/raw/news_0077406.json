Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA mum detained indefinitely for killing her three-year-old daughter has been allowed back into the community just days later. \nParanoid schizophrenic Iman Omar Yousef, 32, admitted killing little Alia Ahmed Jama in February 2010 and told a court she was “driven by voices in her head”. \nThe mum, previously of Milverton Road, Erdington, Birmingham was charged with murder later that year but was unfit to stand trial because of her mental illness. \nThe Birmingham Mail reports Yousef was finally deemed fit to plead this week and admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. \nShe was detained under the Mental Health Act since her arrest and a judge has ruled she will continue to be detained indefinitely in order to protect the public. The three-year-old was discovered inside the family home in Birmingham (Photo: PA) \nBut it emerged during sentencing that Yousef has already been permitted unescorted visits in the community from the Birmingham mental health unit where she has been living. \nShe has been subject to “intensive treatment and therapy” at the hospital, but has been permitted escorted visits in the community since September 2014 and unescorted visits since May of last year. \nYousef wiped away tears as a judge outlined details of the attack, which she said was entirely a result of Yousef’s mental illness. \nThe court heard she feared Alia would be taken away and that she was hearing voices that said Alia would be “safe in death.” \nShe stabbed her dozens of times before dousing her body in a highly corrosive liquid that corroded her skin, bones and internal organs. Iman Omar Yousef outside court (Photo: PA) \nConsultant forensic psychiatrist Dr John Croft told Worcester Crown Court that Yousef continued to suffer from a long-term condition that was liable to relapse. \nHe added: “Because of the nature of her symptoms, that involve delusions about other people, should she relapse there could be significant risk of serious harm in the future. \n“The mental disorder entirely explains her actions at the time.”The court heard Yousef had been a “loving and over-protective mother” but her mental state had deteriorated since 2001. \nMrs Justice Carr said Yousef began to suffer from schizophrenia in 2001, characterised by “bizarre delusions and auditory hallucinations”. \nShe said: “Your schizophrenia went untreated for some eight years prior to the death of your daughter.“Voices were telling you that your family was not your real family. Yousef was sentenced at Worcester Crown Court this week (Photo: Getty) \n\"You feared that your daughter would be taken away from you and harmed. Your offending is directly and wholly attributable to your paranoid schizophrenia. \n“There is no indication that you did anything other than love your daughter and, at the time, in killing her, you believed you were protecting her.” \nAlwyn Jones, on behalf of Yousef, said: “The entirety of the medical evidence demonstrates the extent of the mental illness she was suffering from at the time of the tragic events. \n“There was nothing else to suggest this defendant would have harmed her daughter. Voices told her it would be in her daughter’s interests to be killed and she would be safe in death. \n“There is evidence of this lady being a caring mother, who was overprotective of her daughter, but unfortunately the illness manifested in 2001 and she had received no treatment by 2010. She accepts full responsibility of the tragic death of Alia. \n“Whatever sentence the court passes she knows she is responsible for the death of her own daughter and that is something she will have to struggle with.” \nYousef was detained indefinitely under Section 37 of the Mental Health Act and restricted under Section 41 of the act.
