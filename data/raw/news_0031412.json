Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY Sports WINSTON-SALEM — Wake Forest led NC State nine minutes into the game by four points, 14-10. Over the final 11 minutes of the half, Wake pulled away to make the contest effectively over, outscoring NCSU 30-14 to take a 44-24 lead at the break.\nWake would end up winning 88-58.\nBoth NCSU head coach Mark Gottfried and redshirt sophomore wing Torin Dorn both reflected back to that stretch as the moment that the contest got out of hand for the Pack.\nGottfried broke it down in simple terms: NC State lost its poise.\n“Poise means executing the offense, getting a better shot,” Gottfried explained. “Poise means fixing something defensively without dropping your head a little bit. I think that was probably the biggest difference … then you down 20-something and now you are swimming uphill and trying like crazy to get out of hole.”\n“It kind of got away from us and we just stopped competing,” Dorn added. “We came back in the second half, competed, but it was already a foregone conclusion by then.”\nNoticeably struggling in the first half for the second-straight road blowout loss (NC State lost 95-71 at Florida State on Wednesday night) was star freshman point guard Dennis Smith Jr. Against the Noles, Smith went scoreless before halftime for the first time season. He was not much better against Wake Forest.\nSmith went 2 of 6 from the field, missing his one three-point attempt, and had four points with two assists and three turnovers in 16 minutes.\nSmith would finish the contest with a much better second half. He made 5 of 7 shots after halftime to finish with a team-high 17 points. He also did not turn it over in 18 second half minutes before reportedly removing himself from the game with 2:38 left.\nTeam Morale Being Challenged NC State is in an undeniable spiraling skid. It has lost five straight since winning at Duke in Cameron Indoor Stadium on Feb. 23. Three of those losses have been by 25, 24 and 30 points, all on the road. They also blew a second half 16-point lead to lose at home in overtime against Syracuse in that span.\nThus it is understandable that team morale may begin to become an issue for NC State, something Gottfried did not deny after the game.\n“It’s a concern, there’s no question about it,” he said.\nGottfried said that he and his staff will try to set the example by make sure the players see that the coaching staff is not laying down. Gottfried also expressed confidence that his team will follow that lead.\n“We are going to keep fighting, and we got to kind of eliminate some of the other things that are kind of around us, and got to try to draw in a little closer as a team, stay together,” Gottfried said. “We are the same team that went into Cameron and won. We are the same team that beat Virginia Tech couple days after they beat Duke 20. That same group is in that locker room.\n“We got to figure it out. We got to get better, tougher. Got to get to the foul line more, get more stops, all those type things, but there is not going to be anybody laying down in our group. I don’t believe that at all.”\nDorn added that it almost feels like the Pack has reached its rock bottom.\n“With five straight losses, the only way to go is up,” Dorn said. “We just have to come with better energy, better focus, try to turn this thing around.”\nDorn Has Best Game In Long Stretch If there was any bright spot for Wolfpack nation besides the gorgeous weather for a mid-afternoon February, it may have been the play of Dorn. He finished with a double-double of 14 points and 11 rebounds in 29 minutes off the bench. He shot 5 for 11 from the field and made 4 of 5 free throws.\nIt has been a prolonged struggle for Dorn after a strong start to the season. He scored at least 16 points in all but one of the first eight games (and had 12 in that lone other contest) and two double-doubles in that stretch.\nIn the next 17 games, he has scored in double figures in just five games with a high in that period of 13 points twice, ironically one of them in the loss at home to Wake Forest.\nIn the last five games, Dorn has a combined total of 19 points and 11 rebounds.\n“We need him,” Gottfried said. “I thought today he was really good. I thought he was just competing really hard. He started off the year really, really well, and then he got where he wasn’t. We need him to play well. We are going to keep fighting, and he needs to be a big part of it. He was today.”\n——\n• Talk about it inside The State of Basketball\n• Subscribe to our podcast on iTunes\n• Learn more about our print and digital publication, The Wolfpacker\n• Follow us on Twitter: @TheWolfpacker\n• Like us on Facebook\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/fmqpa5rdpxkusktbotqi", "https://www.facebook.com/TheWolfpacker/", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-wolfpacker-podcast/id452105230?mt=2", "http://thewolfpackeronline.com/the-wolfpacker-magazine-2/", "https://twitter.com/TheWolfpacker", "https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/fmqpa5rdpxkusktbotqi)"], "published": "2017-02-11T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:45:28.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
