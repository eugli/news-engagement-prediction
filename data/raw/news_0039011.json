It’s unclear when Robertson, 25, who was being treated at a local hospital, died.\nRobertson was taking a bus from Memphis to Minneapolis and was on a stopover at Union Station, Chicago’s main transit hub, when the shooting occurred Wednesday evening.\nAccording to family members, the transit officer fired at Robertson as he ran during an encounter near Union Station, Chicago’s main transit hub. The officer reportedly fired twice, striking Robertson once in the left shoulder, authorities and relatives said.\nThe officers involved remained on administrative assignment in accordance with department policy, an Amtrak spokesman said last week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:10:27.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
