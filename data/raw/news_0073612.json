During his election campaign, Trump branded immigrants from Mexico rapists and criminals.\nPena Nieto last month canceled a meeting after Trump insisted he would make Mexico pay for the wall.\nThe US State Department said in a statement the officials will discuss \"border security, law enforcement cooperation, and trade, among other issues.\"\nMexico, which announced the visit last week, said it was aimed at building \"a respectful, close and constructive relationship between the two countries.\"\nTillerson and Kelly will also meet with Mexico's ministers of the interior, foreign affairs, finance, defense and the navy, US government statements said.\n- Border security -\nUS immigration authorities have arrested hundreds of people across the country as part of Trump's pledge to crack down on people, mostly Latinos, who are in the country illegally.\nKelly on Tuesday issued new orders to authorities to begin arresting and deporting illegal immigrants.\nMexico could use border cooperation as a card in negotiations.\n\"We have been a great ally to fight problems with migration, narcotics,\" warned Mexico's economy secretary Ildefonso Guajardo in an interview with Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail.\n\"If at some point in time things become so badly managed in the relationship, the incentives for the Mexican people to keep on cooperating in things that are at the heart of (US) national security issues will be diminished.\"\n- Trade -\nTrump has vowed to end Mexico's privileged trade relationship with the United States, blaming Mexico for the loss of American jobs.\nHe has threatened to block remittances sent home by Mexican workers in the United States.\nPena Nieto has vowed to defend Mexico's interests and called for respect from the United States.\nHe said in January that Mexico would reach out to other countries to seek alternative trade accords.\nEconomists at Spanish bank BBVA said in a research note that uncertainty over Trump's economic policies is damaging investor confidence in Mexico.\nIt forecast the uncertainty would curb investment in Mexico and slow down its economic growth to one percent this year from two percent last year.\n- Series of talks -\nKelly was scheduled to leave on Wednesday for Guatemala to discuss migration and trade before heading to Mexico to join up with Tillerson.\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Kelly will meet with Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales as well as the ministers of government and foreign affairs.\nHe will also observe the arrival of a DHS flight repatriating undocumented migrants to Guatemala from the United States.\nNo detailed agenda has yet been released for the Mexico visit.\nThe US officials start their trips on Wednesday. The Mexican foreign ministry said last week that the meetings would take place on Thursday.\nMexico's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said the meeting would be the first in a series.\nHe met with Tillerson last week in Germany at a G20 gathering.\n\"Mexico wants to build bridges, not walls,\" Videgaray said.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:22:33.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
