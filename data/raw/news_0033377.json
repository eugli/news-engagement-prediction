Both men smiled, but said very little to one another during the photo op, which lasted less than two minutes. President Trump to @JustinTrudeau in Oval Office: \"I think they might want a hand shake.\" pic.twitter.com/47Lkj5Z4SU â€” CSPAN (@cspan) February 13, 2017 \nThe two leaders had a one-on-one chat followed by bilateral discussions at 11:25 a.m. \nTrump and Trudeau joined female business leaders for a roundtable discussion on the advancement of women at 12:15. Trump's daughter, Ivanka, sat next to Trudeau for the chat, and was first to speak after the two leaders. \nThe PM and the POTUS sat down for a working lunch shortly before 1 p.m. \nThe two leaders will participate in a joint press conference and media availability at 2 p.m. \nThat will wrap up Trudeau's time with Trump, but not his time in Washington.
