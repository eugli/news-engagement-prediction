It’s an increase from only four locations in B.C. that offered this service. \nOver 15,000 customers registered their decision on organ donation during the pilot program in North Vancouver, Abbotsford, Kelowna and Vancouver in 2016. Story continues below \nICBC says 51 per cent of British Columbians think they have made a registered decision on organ donation, but in fact only 21 per cent have. \n“More than 600 people are desperately waiting for organ donation in B.C.,” said Greg Kyllo, MLA for Shuswap. “We saw tremendous success through ICBC and BC Transplant’s initial partnership. The government of British Columbia is thrilled to see the program expanding. We believe it can make a real difference.” \nBC Transplant says the program will help boost the number of organ donors in the province. \n“The conversation around organ donation and registering your wishes is so important, and we need to create opportunities for these conversations to happen in communities, workplaces, and with family and friends. The expansion of the ICBC program does just that,” said Leanne Appleton, BC Transplant’s provincial executive director. “Talking about organ donation has a direct impact on organ donor registrations, and can lead to more British Columbians receiving life-saving transplants.” \nYou can also sign up to be an organ donor online at BC Transplant’s website . \nThere are currently just over one million registered donors in the province, but hundreds are desperately waiting for transplants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:41:29.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
