We absolutely have to be united or we have no chance to do it,\" said the Frenchman, in comments that were plastered across the sports pages of British newspapers on Friday. \n\"You have Tottenham, everyone is in the fight and everyone is behind their team. We have to do exactly the same, even if we had two disappointing results.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:07:08.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
