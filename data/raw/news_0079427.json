By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Tuesday, February 28, 2017 - 00:01   Black holes and their behaviour have long since been no less than an enigma for scientists to decipher. \nFound in abundance in the universe, these gravity-pulling black holes have always been known to exist in distant galaxies. \nIf that wasn't enough, a research released on Monday suggested that supermassive black holes rip up and devour hapless stars a hundred times more frequently than thought. \nScientists had previously calculated that such cosmic cannibalism was extremely rare, happening once every 10,000 to 100,000 years per galaxy. \nThese so-called \"tidal disruption events\" had only been witnessed in astronomical surveys canvassing tens of thousands of galaxies. \nNASA captures never-seen before image of echoes of black holes eating stars! \nBut the authors of a new study said they spotted a star being destroyed by a black hole in a survey of only 15 galaxy collisions – an extremely small sample size by astronomy standards. \nThe chances of a star disappearing into the maw of a black hole go up a hundredfold when galaxies crash, they concluded. \n\"Our surprising findings show that when two galaxies collide, it dramatically increases how often stars get ripped apart and swallowed,\" co-author James Mullaney, an astronomer at the University of Sheffield, told AFP. \nSupermassive black holes are millions to billions times more massive than our Sun. \nAstronomers agree they reside at the centre of almost all known major galaxies. The Milky Way's own black hole – currently dormant – is tucked inside the constellation Sagittarius. \nBut exactly how these monsters form is still hotly debated among scientists. \nFor the new study, a team led by astronomer Clive Tadhunter, also from Sheffield, analysed 15 colliding galaxies, each containing billions of stars. \nIn 2015, they noticed a startling change in one of them – galaxy F01004-2237, some 1.7 billion light years from Earth – compared to a decade earlier. \nSifting through historical data collected by the Catalina Sky Survey, the researchers traced the transformation to 2010. \nThe brightness flared that year in a way consistent with the death throes of a star being ripped apart. \n\"Our study shows that galaxy collisions play an important role in causing stars to fall toward black holes,\" Mullaney said. \nOnce in the danger zone, the doomed star is sucked in by a black hole's gravitational pull. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Tuesday, February 28, 2017 - 00:01 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:38:34.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
