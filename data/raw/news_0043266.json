The newly-released – and perhaps somewhat “beta”– application, called “SMSGear,” was created by Senior Member James St-Pierre and was uploaded to the site on February 15. The idea behind the app was to solve a problem with SMS messages between the Samsung’s Gear S3 and non-Samsung Android smartphones. \nAt the root of the problem that SMSGear is built to solve are the limitations that Samsung’s Gear S3 smartwatches have when used with Android devices that are not made by Samsung with integration in mind. Samsung has added a couple of partners since then, such as WatchMaker , to improve other aspects of the device. However, despite the company also finally allowing the Tizen-powered device to be used with other manufacturers’ smartphones, beginning with the Gear S2, one limitation still experienced by those users has been the lack of any kind of Android SMS integration with the smartwatch. “SMSGear,” as its name suggests, seeks to solve that very limitation. While the app in its current form doesn’t allow for new SMS conversations to be created via the watch, it does allow for the viewing and sending of messages. SMSGear also allows the user to set limits to the number of conversations handled by the user’s Gear S3, as well as control over how many messages will be sent to the device from each of those conversations. The developer acknowledges in the listing that there may be unforeseen quirks and glitches – in addition to seeing the potential for many more SMS-based features. He has also made the application completely open source so that the community of developers at XDA can set to work improving and refining the app. Unfortunately, there are also a couple of limitations on the Android side of things. The developer lists both the ability to delete messages and to delete conversations through the smartwatch in that category, as those are things that no Android smartwatch can currently do. \nIf you want to try SMSGear out, you should be forewarned that the application is not yet ready for what many users would call a “straight forward” installation. Although basic instructions are included with the listing, you will need to have knowledge of – or be ready to learn – how to install applications using both Android Studio and Tizen Studio. It is possible that the application will gain an easier method of installation, such as through a simple APK, in the future. Although there is certainly no guarantee, whether or not it does will most likely depend on the feedback and popularity it generates on XDA Developers.
