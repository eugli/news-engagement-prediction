Credit: Brooke Wehr on Instagram Credit: Brook Wehr on Instagram \nThe Calvert-Wehr drama began when Brooke shared a meme reading, \"Yes my love, I love you. I swear I won't cheat on you tonight,\" over the image of a side chick grinding on a shady teen boy, RadarOnline.com reports. \nThe single mom’s caption dragged a TM2 producer into the infidelity accusations. Mandi (@mAnDi06) April 4, 2016 \n\"Sounds about right. Too bad he f****d the producer @mandi06,\" Brooke wrote below the now-deleted meme, tagging Chelsea Houska ’s field producer Mandi Venturino. \nAnother ‘Gram posting reveals how, exactly, Leah Messer ’s ex-husband, 28, supposedly cheated on his latest love interest. Credit: Brooke Wehr on Instagram \n\"You just talk to bitches for hours on end everyday until 2am,\" she captioned another critical meme before erasing the message. \n\"Haha I don't know who the hell you think you're fooling, but you're a terrible liar.\" \nSomehow, the deception goes even further than this. Credit: Brooke Wehr on Instagram \nBrooke also alleged her husband-to-be listed a mistress as “Tim” in his phone to hide the other woman in plain sight, adding, “Guess Leah was right. I should have listened.” \nDespite all of these damning claims, Jeremy has yet to directly respond to any cheating speculation. \nInstead, he’s shared a few eyebrow-raising Instagram posts about single life. \nKeeping with the meme theme, the Adalynn’s dad shared one reading, “Single AF? D—k still big tho [sic].” \nCredit: Jeremy Calvert on Instagram \nAt least Jeremy’s next upload hinting towards his apparent breakup is a little more family-friendly. \nOn Sunday, February 19, Leah’s ex shared a sweet photo of Addie, writing, “The only girl i need in my life only thing she complains about is the wrong color bug juice lmao.” Credit: Jeremy Calvert on Instagram \nAlthough Jeremy is apparently too busy to deny any supposed infidelities, accused other woman Mandi is ready to do so. \nThe MTV producer tweeted, “#Alternativefacts #fakenews have a lovely day everyone,” in response to the rumors.
