You got: Wrong! \nAlthough iconic, Kim’s vampire selfie only got 150,000 likes making it the least popular of the bunch. You got: Wrong! \nKim’s ~belfie~ became instantly iconic and inspired a whole book of selfies. However, with 1.1 million likes, it’s not the most popular of these pics. You got: Wrong! \nKanye directed this fur bikini shoot, but his work only received 980,000 likes. You got: Wrong! \nBut so close! This is the second most-liked picture on Kim’s Instagram – and, at one point, was the most popular Instagram post of all time, with 2.4 million likes. You got: Wrong! \nThe “just married” jackets were nothing short of iconic, but this image isn’t the most liked here, with 738,000 double-taps. You got: Wrong! \nRemember Kim caused when she cropped North out of this photo because “her eyes were shut and I was feeling my look!” All of that furore for just 685,000 likes. You got: Wrong! \nKim and Kanye had North West baptised in the birth place of actual Jesus Christ, but this iconic photo only amassed 832,000 likes. You got: Wrong! \nKanye’s proposal to Kim was an OTT affair involving a baseball stadium, 50 piece orchestra, fireworks and a 15 carat ring. This photo from the occasion received 965,000 likes, so it’s not the most popular here. You got: Wrong! \nKim’s naked selfie became an international talking point, but it’s actually the third most liked photo here. You got: Correct! \nAfter her horrific robbery ordeal when she was held up at gunpoint, Kim stayed completely off social media for an unprecedented 3 months. She returned with this family portrait – and it became her most liked photo ever, with 4.2 million double-taps. You got: Wrong! \nKim’s vacation to Mexico was thirst-trapping at its finest, and this iconic beach selfie proved pretty popular, with 1.2 million likes. You got: Wrong! \nThis snap of Kanye in bed, and her caption: “Side chicks be like” was iconic af, but this pic isn’t the most liked of the bunch, with 1.2 million.
