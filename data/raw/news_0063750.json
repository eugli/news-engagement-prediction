MUST READ Tamil Nadu power tussle: MK Stalin-led DMK begins hunger strike against CM Palaniswami's trust vote \nOn the other hand, DMK Working President MK Stalin along with several party leaders is staging a hunger strike protest in Tiruchi to protest against the forceful eviction and manhandling of party MLAs by Speaker P Dhanapal during the trust vote in Tamil Nadu assembly on February 18. \nThe decision to sit on a hunger strike came after a special meeting of MLAs was convened by Stalin at the party headquarters in Chennai on Sunday. \nThe meeting was held after police filed an FIR against members of the party for holding a protest on Marina Beach the previous day. The police said the FIR was filed for unlawful assembly and violation of public order. \nPalanisamy had won the trust vote 122-11 in the 234-member Assembly, aided by the eviction of DMK and walkout by its allies last Saturday. \nDMK has 89 MLAs in the Assembly. \nThe division vote was taken up after two adjournments following uproarious scenes as opposition MLAs insisted on a secret vote, which was rejected by Speaker P Dhanapal. \nEarlier, the DMK moved a no-confidence motion against the Assembly Speaker, with the party`s working president and leader of opposition in the Assembly, MK Stalin accusing the Speaker of deliberately harping on his community to malign the party.
