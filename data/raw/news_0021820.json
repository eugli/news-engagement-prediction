Since last June’s massacreat Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, the coalition has seen a 25-percent rise in demand for its services. The $100,000 grant will cover housing and counseling. \n“This really helps us create a safe space for our youth,” said Earl Johnson, the organization’s development manager. \nOther grants ranged from $20,000 to $75,000 apiece for after-school and literacy programs and agencies serving at-risk youth, foster teens and kids with disabilities. \n“It’s a very emotional day — for everybody,” said Magic CEO Alex Martins . “These are organizations that don’t have big budgets and that work incredibly hard all year long. So to get a $100,000 grant really has an impact.” \nThe money comes from donations and fundraising events hosted by the youth fund and is matched 50 cents on the dollar by the Robert R. McCormick Foundation. This is the ninth year it has distributed $1 million in grants. \nor 407-420-5503.
