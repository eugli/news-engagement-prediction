Slot to Philadelphia Links \nThe Philadelphia Eagles have made their first crucial decision of the offseason. \nAccording to an ESPN report , the Eagles approached longtime left tackle Jason Peters about taking a pay cut for 2017. Peters, 35, has a cap hit of $11.2 million and a base salary set at $10.45 million. Both are the highest on the team. \nThe Eagles are expected to start a salary cap purge this month in order to create enough salary cap space to sign a wide receiver or two in free agency. Restructuring Peters's contract is the first step. \nThe Philadelphia Eagles have a crucial offseason ahead of them as the franchise looks to return to the playoffs for the first time since 2013.

He earned a $500,000 roster bonus for making the Pro Bowl in 2016.
