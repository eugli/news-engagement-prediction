Allocations have been increased for affordable housing, infrastructure, rural development, social sectors across the board,” the minister said. “I think this is a budget that will satisfy the demand of every section of society. To give a growth-oriented budget without burdening people with taxes but giving relief to large sections of society and thrust to infrastructure spending is truly a fantastic job.” \n\nGoyal said the announcement on cleansing political funding was long awaited. “It is one big measure which will help more and more people to join the political process without fear, donate liberally so that bad money can be removed from politics and only honest money will help finance politics in the future,” he said. \n\nThe minister said most of the power sector is self-sufficient. “Through honest, transparent bidding we have been able to bring down the cost of renewable energy. Power sector through the UDAY (Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana) programme is fast moving towards profitability and self-sufficiency. The power and mining sectors have received all that we had requested,” he said.
