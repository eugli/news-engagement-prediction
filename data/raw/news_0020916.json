Donner The Washington State Opportunity Scholarship – chaired by Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith – is giving out $6 million in grants to help three Washington state universities expand science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs. The grants will go directly to schools to train more K-12 STEM teachers and expand computer science programs for low- and middle-income students to help fill the state’s estimated 23,000 unfilled technology jobs. Microsoft's Brad Smith chairs the program, which helps low- and middle-income Wash.… more Marcus R. Donner “We all lose out when an inspired student can’t pursue a science, technology, engineering or mathematics degree,” Smith wrote in a LinkedIn post announcing the grants . “We need creative, efficient programs that remove barriers to higher education and enable students to go from an interest in STEM to a degree, a job and a career in these growing fields.” Central Washington University will use $2.2 million for a new program to recruit STEM undergraduate majors and prepare them to become teachers without adding time and cost to their degree programs. The university plans to double the number of graduating STEM teachers in the next five to seven years.

Western wants to increase computer science graduation rates 25 percent by 2019. The University of Washington will use $2.2 million to boost advisers and faculty for a program aiming expand the university’s capacity to boost the success rate of disadvantaged students through computer science and engineering degrees. Smith helped create the scholarship program, which mainly helps low- and middle-income students in the state earn bachelor’s degrees in STEM and health care. In the past five years, the program has helped more than 5,500 Washington students with up to $22,500 in grants. The idea behind the program is to help disadvantaged residents get a college education while supplying the state’s talent-starved companies with workers. So far, it’s working. Around 90 percent of the 1,500 students who have graduated through the program have remained in the state. The scholarship has raised $97 million – including $35 million from Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), plus donations from Boeing (NYSE: BA), and the state plans to match the funds.
