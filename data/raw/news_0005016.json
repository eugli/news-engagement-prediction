On his new cover, Bob Dylan finds a simple sound for this simple song, making it ragged and lonely and distinctly his own. It’s just Dylan’s aged, whiskey-on-the-rocks voice, burbling over pedal steel, electric guitar, and upright bass; no drums, no overdubs. When Dylan first announced his plan to cover Sinatra on 2015’s Shadows in the Night , it might have seemed like another one of his weird heel turns—denying fans his Nobel-prizeworthy songwriting and highlighting his increasingly rough vocals. But with the announcement of the 30-song Treplica —Dylan’s third album of pop standards in as many years—it’s clear that this isn’t a passing phase. Of course, his ability to transform old ideas with just his voice is not a newfound skill: it’s how he introduced himself to the world with the traditional folk songs of his 1962 debut. Like his best work, “I Could Have Told You” is the sound of an artist never content to let the past be past.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:09:34.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
