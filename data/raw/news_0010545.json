Addressing a rally in Aligarh, Modi said that BJP will bring Vikas which stands for Vidyut (electricity), Kanoon (law and order) and Sadak (roads) if elected. He trained his guns on the state government for failing to maintain law and order, saying women cannot venture outside their homes after the sun sets. \"The law and order situation in UP is the worst in the country. More than 7,650 crimes, including 24 rapes, 21 attempt to rape, 13 murders, 33 kidnappings, 136 thefts and 19 riots take place every day,\" he said. Launching a scathing attack on the Akhilesh Yadav government for \"doing nothing\" to develop the state, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the chief minister was desperately seeking whatever support is coming his way to retain power. \"The wave of BJP is so strong that the Uttar Pradesh CM is grabbing whatever support he gets as he fears of being washed out,\" PM said, taking a dig at the SP-Congress poll alliance. Claiming that the \"corrupt\" politicians and political parties were ganging up against him and issuing \"fatwas\", Modi said, \"These people are scared as I am tightening the screws to teach those supporting black money a lesson. They don't want the BJP to get a majority in the Rajya Sabha as they fear that if that happens I would make laws from which they would not be able to escape.\" Referring to demonetisation, Modi said it led to a chaos amongst these corrupt people, as they were forced to deposit their ill-gotten wealth in bank accounts. \"We want this money to be used for the good of the people,\" he said expressing gratitude to \"the 1.2 billion people who supported the move\". Attacking the SP government, Modi said, \"Past governments in UP worked in such a manner that it led to the closure of famous Aligarh lock industry as they could not provide enough electricity.\" Mocking the state government, Modi said if electricity was supplied, people can enjoy that power. The Prime Minister had taken a similar jibe during his election campaign for Bihar last year. He attacked the state government for \"doing nothing for development\" and accused it of neither checking corruption, casteism and nepotism, nor clearing the cane farmers' dues. \"Youths were asked to pay bribe and bring recommendation for interviews by MLAs and Ministers. Poor have to mortgage land and assets to pay. This has to be stopped. Our central government had stopped interviews for class three and four. The selection has been computerised on the basis of marks earned by a candidate,\" the Prime Minister said. He said people will be surprised to know that what magic Modi has done which has resulted in Rs 10,000 crore of annual saving. \"By introducing cheap LED bulbs, we have reduced electricity bills,\" PM said. Playing the Dalit card, PM Modi accused the Congress of \"insulting\" Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar by using his name to use Dalits as a vote bank. He said Babasaheb was not given the \"Bharat Ratna\" till the Congress was in power. Claiming that neither the Congress nor the \"supporting party\" have any right to play politics in the name of Babasaheb, Modi said BJP is developing five places as \"Panchteerth\" in his honour at his birthplace in Mhow, the place in London where he stayed while studying in UK, 'Deeksha Bhoomi' in Nagpur where he got education, 'Mahaparinirvan Sthal' in Delhi and 'Chaitya Bhoomi' in Mumbai. He said he had even launched the BHIM app in Ambedkar's name. \"People who say what right does Narendra Modi have to use BR Ambedkar's name, I want to remind them that he was the economist under whom the Reserve Bank of India was formed. He was a great man and his contributions will never be forgotten. I don't care if people are jealous, but I will always honour him and hold him in highest regard,\" he said.
