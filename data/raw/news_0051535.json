At Northwestern, where an Asian-American studies major will likely begin in the fall, the program has been agitated for since the 1990s, student newspaper The Daily Northwestern reports. \nMany others are still works in progress. \nAt the end of May, 120 Dartmouth College students joined forces with the hashtag #fight4facultyofcolor on behalf of longtime English professor Aimee Bahng, who was denied tenure earlier that month despite receiving unanimous support from her department, The Dartmouth reports. \nFrom 2007 to 2012, according to a 2013 Dartmouth Ad Hoc Committee report , minority faculty left at a disproportionately higher rate than white faculty at Dartmouth. \nAccording to a change.org petition created by “concerned faculty” following Bahng’s tenure denial, her absence would be be a devastating blow to Asian-American studies at Dartmouth. The petition so far has amassed more than 3,600 signatures.

It is unclear whether the timing of the release was coincidental or if the plan was issued in response to the protests. \n“Pending approval by the Board of Trustees, Dartmouth will award tenure to at least four faculty of color this year,” Dartmouth spokesperson Diana Lawrence tells USA TODAY College. “Additionally, seven non-tenured professors of color will join Dartmouth’s Arts & Sciences faculty in the fall.” #Fight4FacultyOfColor bc my classes with these professors were the only classes I didn't have to educate my peers in pic.twitter.com/W6pzlhht0j \n— ps (@89pearls) May 10, 2016 \nOn April 28 at Williams College, the Asian American Students in Action (AASiA) group started a petition calling for Williams to hire another Asian-American professor at the college as well as establish an Asian-American studies concentration — noting that the call for such a program is now 25 years old. \nAccording to the petition, students are upset that the upcoming academic year will have only one course on Asian-American culture — an English class called “Reading Asian American Literature.” This class is limited to 15 students, and will be taught by the English department’s only tenured Asian-American professor, Dorothy Wang. \n“There is no institutional opposition at Williams to an Asian-American studies program,” Williams spokesperson Mary Dettloff tells USA TODAY College. “Faculty must propose a new curricular unit or program to the Curricular Planning Committee first and, so far, that has not happened.” \nWang, however, thinks there’s more to it. \n“I’ve actually had white senior professors tell me ‘Asian Americans haven’t suffered as much as African Americans, so why should we study their literature?’” she says. “The perception is that Asian Americans either haven’t suffered, or that people really don’t want to discuss the U.S. racism against Asian Americans, (like) Chinese Exclusion (or) Japanese American internment. \n“The students are actually realizing that there’s not anyone there that can speak to this really crucial aspect of their history (and) American history, because Asian-American studies is a vital part of thinking of American history,” says Wang. “It’s not just a topic to serve Asian-American students.” \nSome students, like AASiA member Suiyi Tang, are growing tired of waiting for change. \n“(The administration tells us), ‘You’ll have to be patient, change comes slowly at an institution like this,’” says Tang. “And that’s something they’ve been telling us for 25 years.” Grace Li is a student at Harvard College and a USA TODAY College correspondent.
