On Sunday, though, any postgame shrieking she did was in pure joy. \nFox cameras caught Bundchen in the moments after the Patriots’ shocking 34-28 victory was complete. The Brazilian was seen screaming into her phone while recording it then briefly fumbling it after her celebration was complete. \nShe has yet to upload the video to her social media feeds, but we await patiently.
