I got it for you.” \nUngjae holds hands with his crush in his teaser with the caption, “Don’t walk around on your own late at night, I’ll take you home now.” \nTaeho’s café date-themed teaser features the text, “When I’m done drinking this coffee, will we be officially dating?” \nJeup holds up a sketchbook (which reads “Please Be My First Love”) like in the famous scene from the film “Love Actually” in his teaser photo. The caption reads, “You said you were envious when you watched the movie, right? That’s why I planned this.” \nLastly, Leesang looks studious in his teaser as he bends over a workbook, and the caption reads, “Once this question is solved, I’ll confess my feelings for you.” \nWhat do you think of IMFACT’s new teasers?
