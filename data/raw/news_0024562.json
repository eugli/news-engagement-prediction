Really like those guys. Coach Pete Nochta, is real cool, too.\" \nLacey will return to The Ville early next month to visit with Cardinals new defensive coordinator Peter Sirmon and visit the University's Speed School of Engineering. \n\"Yesterday was about meeting Coach Summers and continue growing my relationship with Coach Scott,\" he said, adding that he'll return on March 4. \"I'll meet the new defensive coordinator and spend time with him. I'm also going to take a tour of the engineering department because that's what I plan to study. So I'm looking forward to March 4.\" \nLouisville was one of the first to extend a scholarship offer to the 6-foot-2, 300-pound prospect and has since been joined by Cincinnati, Michigan State, Notre Dame, Purdue, and Tennessee.
