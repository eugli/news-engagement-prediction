The Oscars 2017 was a glittery night for Hollywood, with this awards season favourite, La La Land, going on to sweep the ceremony with six Oscars. The event saw a major goof-up when La La Land was mistakenly announced as the Best Picture winner before it was rectified and Moonlight was presented with the trophy. Apart from this, we had Desi Girl Priyanka Chopra on the Oscars red carpet, dazzling in a white and silver Ralph and Russo gown. Dev Patel lost his Best Supporting Actor Oscar to Mahershala Ali, who won it for Moonlight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:26:41.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
