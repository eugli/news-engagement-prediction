The couple’s fans can no longer experience the thrill of looking at their photos together. Gonzales’ Instagram is left with nothing more than her solo adventures. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe Kapamilya couple went public with their relationship back in 2015 and since then, many had thought they were altar-bound. Now they’re asking, “Are they indeed breaking up?” \nMany of the duo’s fans have barraged Matsunaga’s Instagram account with questions asking what’s happening. \nTo finally give concerned fans and bashers alike a glimpse of the real deal, the actor revealed via a post that they were indeed going through “some personal things.” He did not elaborate. \n“Guys I would like to ask a favor pls…we are talking and going through some personal things…all we need is your support and love…not people talking trash… we love you all with no limit and we just need some respect and time. Thank you. God bless you guys…,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T16:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:14:44.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
