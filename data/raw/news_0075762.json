Auburn men’s basketball may have lost to Arkansas Saturday, but Auburn student Ben Bode won big: Layup ☑️ — Auburn Tigers (@AuburnTigers) February 26, 2017 Bode, a junior, was called to the court at halftime to do a series of increasingly difficult shots. After sinking the layup, free throw and three pointer, he got to halfcourt. He decided to try a perfect granny throw, and he sunk the shot to win $5,000 towards his tuition. The crowd went extremely wild, and Bode celebrated in the most heartwarming way: The SEC Network even showed footage of head football coach Gus Malzahn asking Bode for a picture. Then he got to meet and take a picture with @CoachGusMalzahn . pic.twitter.com/PqxhZIjGu7 — Justin Ferguson (@JFergusonAU) February 26, 2017 If you’re going to have 15 minutes of fame, earning $5,000 towards your tuition is the way to do it.
