I’m fat, but I’m losing it.”\nThe motivational speaker told The Sun that patients who were struggling with their health and needed to lose weight would often go to see a GP or dietitian.\n“Don’t get me wrong, a lot of these guys do a great job, and they are role models, but if the dietitian’s fatter than the patient, how on Earth is that going to motivate them?” he said.\n“I want NHS [National Health Service] staff to volunteer to wear it to inspire not just the patient but themselves to take action. I want them to be proud that they are losing weight. I want that communicated to the patient. I think it’s a very fair message.\n“Package it right, and fat shaming can be really constructive — because shame has been proven to be an emotion that can really motivate people. It creates the ‘ouch’ factor, but then what we do is give some aspiration to the person to drive them forwards.”\nSteve Miller wants government workers to wear these badges.

Source: The Sun \nIn response, NHS staff began posting their own “badges” on social media , with handwritten phrases including “I’m fat and I don’t care!” and “I’m chunky and I like pizza and wine”. Many blamed the combination of shift work and the lifestyle associated with the career for being overweight.\nIn 2015, a major international study found that obesity awareness may actually be causing overeating , due to people who believe they are overweight resorting to “comfort eating”.\n“It certainly goes against all the common wisdom that you must find all the overweight people and tell them,” University of Minnesota psychologist Traci Mann told The Guardian . “This suggests that is not a good strategy.”\nWriting in The Independent , “fat positive activist” Fran Hayden said the study confirmed that “fat acceptance is good for our health” . “Fat acceptance does not encourage people to be unhealthy: fat acceptance gives people the opportunity to cast off those constant negative jibes,” she said.\n“It offers a space where fat people are allowed to be comfortable with their bodies, and to work from there — whether that means maintaining the same shape or changing it.”\nIn 2015, popular social news site Reddit banned a number communities under new anti-harassment rules, including “Fat People Hate”, a forum dedicated to posting pictures of overweight people for ridicule.\nMr Miller, however, argued the government should “ban any promotion, directly or indirectly, that says ‘fat is beautiful’.”\n“How can they say that to somebody? Because what you’re really saying to somebody is, ‘It doesn’t really matter if you die early’,” he told The Sun .\n“My view on fat acceptance is that those people are riddled with poison. Anybody out there that is promoting fat as acceptable are driving poison down people’s throats that will potentially kill them early.\n“It’s totally unfair on the responsible people that pay their tax, and do eat well, and do a bit of exercise. Because they are having to subsidise the irresponsible.”\nIn 2007, the cost of obesity to the UK economy was estimated to be £15.8 billion ($25.6 billion) per year — including a £4.2 billion ($6.8 billion) direct strain on the NHS.\nIn Australia, 63 per cent of adults are either overweight (35 per cent) or obese (28 per cent). Experts believe by 2025, that figure will rise to 41 per cent overweight and 34 per cent obese, or three quarters of the population. In 2008, the cost to the Australian economy was estimated to be $58.2 billion annually .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:39:25.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
