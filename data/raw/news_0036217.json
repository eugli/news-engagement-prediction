He took a hat-trick here in 2001 , not to mention 13 wickets in a historic Test that India won after being forced to follow on. \nOn February 18, 2010, the Turbanator produced another bowling masterclass which helped India maintained their No. 1 spot. \nAFP \nSouth Africa had to survive the day to clinch the series 1-0 and India needed to win at all costs. \nEven as Hashim Amla engaged them in a long vigil, Harbhajan slowly began to chip away at the wickets. \nAs the day's play neared its end, India were facing a race against time and then the moment came. \nHarbhajan trapped Morne Morkel plumb infront of the wicket and it was all over. India won by an innings and 57 runs and the off-spinner took 5 for 59. \nWhat a day it was for India and Harbhajan was the toast of the team as they remained the top Test side. They would hold on to the top spot till 2011. Don't Miss ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T07:38:00.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
