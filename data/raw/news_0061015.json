(Chuck Burton / AP) Meg Kinnard and Tom Foreman Jr. Associated Press \nBecause he had to leave his day job late, the pastor of a South Carolina church canceled his weekly Bible study class. That move may have averted a second round of deadly shootings after nine worshippers had been killed at another black church. \nAccording to federal court documents unsealed Tuesday, Dylann Roof , who was convicted of killing the nine worshippers during Bible study at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, exited an interstate and drove approximately 30 miles northwest toward the Branch AME Church in Summerville, where another Bible study was advertised on a church sign. That was based on GPS evidence, and prosecutors said Roof shut off his GPS device, which they said indicated he stopped the car. \nBut Branch AME pastor the Rev. Rufus Berry told The Associated Press he called off Bible study that night because he was going to be late leaving his job at a cement company. He said he was shocked when he learned through news reports that his church, which has 70 members, had been targeted by Roof. \n\"I'm still trying to digest this. I'm trying to get through it,\" Berry said Wednesday, moments before heading to the very Bible study class that was canceled the night of the shootings. \n\"I would hate to know what the outcome would be. I dread to even think about that,\" he said. \"I thank God that he had us protected\" from a second attack. \nIn December, a jury convicted Roof on 33 federal charges for gunning down nine people as they prayed at the end of a Bible study at the historic Charleston church known as Mother Emanuel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:48:11.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
