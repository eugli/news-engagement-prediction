Janelle Monae played Mary Jackson onscreen in the historic biopic 'Hidden Figures'. \nJohnson calculated many space flight trajectories, including early NASA missions of John Glenn and Alan Shepard, and the 1969 Apollo 11 flight to the Moon, through the Space Shuttle program. \nHer calculations were critical to the success of these missions. Johnson also did calculations for plans for a mission to Mars. \nToday, NASA embraces their legacy and strives to include everyone who wants to participate in its ongoing exploration. \nFirst Published: Monday, February 27, 2017 - 09:31 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:10:25.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
