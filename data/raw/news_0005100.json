I didn’t see this as a full autobiography at first. But I have so much that’s happened in my life already. There was no room for fantasy. I wanted it to be entertaining, but everything from my life seemed to be so strong. It’s all reality. There’s nothing from my life I didn’t want in there.” \nNas recently lent his pen to the Netflix series “The Get Down,” writing raps for one of the show’s main characters .
