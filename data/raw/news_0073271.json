Typically, the daily briefing is televised and open to all news organizations credentialed to cover the White House. \n\n\"The AP believes the public should have as much access to the president as possible,\" Lauren Easton, the AP's director of media relations, said in a statement. \n\nOn Friday, hours after President Donald Trump delivered a speech blasting the media, Spicer invited only a pool of news organizations that represents and shares reporting with the larger press corps. He also invited several other major news outlets, as well as smaller organizations including the conservative Washington Times, One America News Network and Breitbart News, whose former executive chairman, Steve Bannon, is Trump's chief strategist. When the additional news organizations attempted to gain access, they weren't allowed to enter. \n\nThe White House said it felt \"everyone was represented\" by those in the pool and the invited organizations. \n\n\"We decided to add a couple of additional people beyond the pool. Nothing more than that,\" said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders. \n\nWhen asked by a reporter attending whether he was playing favorites, Spicer said the White House had \"shown an abundance of accessibility,\" according to an audio recording of the briefing later circulated by the pool. \n\nThe pool included Reuters, Bloomberg, CBS, Hearst Newspapers and CBS Radio. Others in the briefing were Fox, NBC and ABC. Bloomberg reported that its reporter was unaware of the exclusions until after the briefing. \n\nJohn Roberts, Fox's chief White House correspondent, told anchor Shepard Smith on the air Friday that Fox supports complaints being filed by the White House Correspondents Association and pool TV networks. \n\n\"You can speculate, Shep, that there might be some extenuating circumstances as to why those people were not invited, we're going to look into that further....\" Roberts said. \n\nIn a statement, the correspondent association's president, Jeff Mason, said the group was \"protesting strongly\" against how the briefing was handled by the White House. \n\nCBS News said in a statement that it was the pool's radio and TV outlet Friday. \n\n\"We recorded audio of this event and quickly shared it out of an obligation to protect the interests of all pool members,\" the news division said. \n\nWhen Spicer was asked by a reporter at the briefing whether he was playing favorites, he said he \"disagreed with the premise of the question,\" according to the audio. \n\n\"We've brought more reporters into this process. And the idea that every time that every single person can't get their question answered or fit in a room that we're excluding people. We've actually gone above and beyond with making ourselves, our team, and our briefing room more accessible than probably any prior administration. And so I think you can take that to the bank. \n\n\"We do what we can to accommodate the press. I think we've gone above and beyond when it comes to accessibility, and openness and getting folks _ our officials, our team.\" \n\nDuring a panel discussion last December, Spicer said that open access for the media is \"what makes a democracy a democracy versus a dictatorship.\" \n\nReaction to Friday's events from the barred outlets and others was swift. \n\nDavan Maharaj, editor-in-chief and publisher of the Los Angeles Times, called the newspaper's exclusion \"unfortunate.\" \n\n\"The public has a right to know, and that means being informed by a variety of news sources, not just those filtered by the White House press office in hopes of getting friendly coverage,\" Maharaj said in a statement. \"Regardless of access, the Times will continue to report on the Trump administration without fear or favor.\" \n\nDean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times, said that \"nothing like this has ever happened at the White House in our long history of covering multiple administrations of different parties. We strongly protest the exclusion of The New York Times and the other news organizations. Free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest.\" \n\nCNN's Jake Tapper took aim at the White House as he kicked off \"The Lead with Jake Tapper\" hours after the briefing. \n\n\"A White House that has had some difficulty telling the truth and that has seemed to have trouble getting up to speed on the basic competent functioning of government, and a president who seems particularly averse to any criticism and has called the press the enemies of the American people â€” they're taking the next step in attempting to avoid checks and balances and accountability. \n\n\"It's not acceptable. In fact, it's petulant, and indicative of a lack of basic understanding of how an adult White House functions,\" Tapper said. \n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists also condemned the move by the White House. \n\n\"We are concerned by the decision to bar reporters from a press secretary briefing,\" CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon said in a statement. \"The US should be promoting press freedom and access to information.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:59:08.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
