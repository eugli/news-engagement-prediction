More than good, they gave us a hard game and congratulations to them,\" Mourinho, who won the Cup 10 years ago with Chelsea, said. \n\"Their approach was brave, strong. They had real competitors and if we didn't have the right attitude from everybody we would be in real trouble.\" \nBrilliant goal \nMourinho even graciously applauded as Rovers took the lead with a goal of real quality in the 17th minute. \nThe lively Marvin Emnes did superbly to work some space before slipping an astute pass to Graham who finished superbly into the far corner with an angled shot. \n\"We conceded a brilliant goal,\" Mourinho said, although it was matched by the quality of United's equaliser. \nThere looked little danger when Henrikh Mkhitaryan received the ball inside his own half but he dissected the Rovers defence with a pass played with the outside of his left foot and Rashford rounded Steele before sliding home. \nUnited dominated thereafter but still needed some inspired intervention from their substitutes to seal victory. \nBlackburn never gave up the cause, though, and thought they had scrambled a late equaliser when Anthony Stokes poked the ball home but a linesman's flag cut short the celebrations. \nUnited's success means the fixtures are coming thick and fast as they prepare to visit St Etienne in the Europa League last 32 on Wednesday, protecting a 3-0 first leg lead, then face Southampton in the League Cup final at Wembley next Sunday. \n\"Southampton is sleeping, is eating and resting and working for the League Cup final and we have had to play three tough games,\" Mourinho said. \n\"It is so much more difficult for us, but for good reasons,\" added Mourinho, who can now also look forward to visiting his old club Chelsea in the FA Cup sixth round.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T14:58:12.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
