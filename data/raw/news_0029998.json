Red roses were the most popular and we had orders coming through all day.\" \nLawrence had two extra staff on to cover the busiest day of the year for florists. \nBloom Supply was selling roses for $15 each, $75 for a bunch of six, and $145 for a dozen. \nDespite the rush Lawrence said her shop would open tomorrow as per usual. \nSentimental spending using credit, debit and prepaid cards increased by 17 per cent over the past three years, with the number of items bought up by almost 60 per cent, according to Mastercard. Ad Feedback \nUnsurprisingly flowers were the most popular gift bought by men with almost half of Kiwi blokes planning to treat their partner to a bouquet. \nFor women, a simple card was the most popular gift, followed by chocolate or lollies. Only one in 10 women bought flowers for their partner. \n\"When it comes to Valentine's Day, Kiwis are sticking to traditional favourites including flowers and going out for a meal. The popularity of these gifts shows that Kiwis appreciate classic gestures,\" Mastercard New Zealand and Pacific Islands manager Peter Chisnall. \nBeing a weekday the majority of people surveyed said they would rather spend time at home, while a third of New Zealanders would splash out and treat themselves to a meal out. \nThe majority of Valentine's gifts were bought during the last minute dash on February 13. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:51:19.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
