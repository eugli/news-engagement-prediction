[SCIENCE] Meet Efi Oladele—winner of the Adawe Foundation's genius grant for her achievements in AI and robotics! SEE ALSO: 'Overwatch' hero Doomfist may be coming soon, evidence suggests \nIn the faux interview, Oladele says that she became obsessed with putting together little drones and has tried building robots to do her chores for her. \n\"I want to create things that make our lives better,\" she said. \"And someday, my dream is to build something that can keep us safe, like the new OR15s! I think that would be great.\" \nThe OR15 is something that has never been mentioned in the Overwatch universe. Considering her interests in robots and artificial intelligence, the OR15 could be some sort of RoboCop-esque machine whose goal is to keep the peace. Maybe Oladele's OR15 is the next Overwatch hero. \nIn a small thumbnail image, Oladele appears to be holding some sort of power cell and is wearing gloves and a hat that looks like something a pilot would wear. It's possibly that she is piloting a robotic hero from a distance. \n'Overwatch' character Efi Oladele. \nImage: blizzard entertainment \nThe only reason that she is not likely a hero herself is her age. Putting an 11-year-old into battle doesn't seem like something Blizzard would do. \nOf course, they could just reveal that Oladele is Doomfist, based on some hints that were found last week regarding the reveal of that character. \nThere's also a possibility that Oladele could be a plot point that leads to the reveal of a different hero, like one of her parents that she mentions in the interview. More details will likely be revealed in the coming weeks, similar to how Sombra and Ana were teased for a period of time — although don't expect it to take quite as long as Sombra.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:20:38.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
