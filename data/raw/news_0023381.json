Why? Because someone thought she was trying to compete with Bonang and a full out fan war erupted. Somizi's super sweet tribute to his daughter Twitter remembers Fana Mokoena's acting roles after #SONA2017 'beating' Ntsiki Mazwai takes jabs at Bonang's 'ask a man' radio feature Zinhle had no time for the haters and gave it one person who littered her Instagram page.\nIn the meantime, her Bond said that love doesn't wait for a big occassion.\n\"LOVE must be celebrated everyday. Does it not give us strength, courage, motivation and determination to move in the direction of our dreams? Does it not inspire greatness within us and mould us into better humans? So why do we wait for one day in the year to celebrate something so powerful and beautiful? We don't believe in V'day. We believe in EVERYDAY❤️ May LOVE overflow in our hearts and souls. May we always see the world and all it's beauty through the eyes of LOVE.\"\nHe posted the message next to a collage and, well, it was enough to warm even our hearts.\nA photo posted by Brendon (@brendonnaidoo) on Feb 9, 2017 at 7:05am PST", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?app_id=162804257120529&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.timeslive.co.za%2Fentertainment%2F2017%2F02%2F10%2FScrew-Valentines-Day-Zinhles-bae-is-going-to-celebrate-her-errday&send=false&layout=box_count&width=95&show_faces=true&action=recommend&colorscheme=light&font&height=65", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQS5SAKDD9S/", "http://www.reddit.com/static/button/button3.js"], "published": "2017-02-10T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:56:58.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
