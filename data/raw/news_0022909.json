The Ras Al Khaimah Police, in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior and RAK Customs, have foiled an attempt to smuggle a large quantity of morphine into the country. Col Adnan Ali Al Zaabi, director of the anti-narcotics department, RAK Police, said they were alerted that an Asian drug dealer would be trying to bring in the drugs. \"Armed with the prosecution permission, a team was formed in coordination with the anti-narcotics directorate-general and the RAK Customs to set a trap and nab the suspect.\" The anti-narcotics team tracked down the suspect when he arrived at the RAK international airport. \"The suspect tried to mislead the team but he was arrested.\" The officials seized morphine worth Dh100,000 from his possession. A few days ago, the RAK Police apprehended one of the biggest drug dealers in the country. \"The Arab suspect used nick names to cover his real identity.\" A large amount of drugs were found on the suspect, and some other narcotics and white weapons were extracted from his car, Col Zaabi explained. He said the RAK Police will show zero tolerance to drug smugglers and dealers . \"They are mainly targeting the young people, especially the Emiratis.\" Parents should take responsibility for protecting their children from the drug dealers, Col Al Zaabi stated. He said a drug abuser can be easily identified from a set of indications, spanning regular absence, staying outdoors for long hours, abnormal response and reactions, laziness and reddish eyes.
