Kaka Bag-ao ended her own interpallation of the bill, where she sparred with Deputy Speaker Fredenil Castro on the floor. \nLawmakers argued whether House rules were being followed with the move to terminate the plenary debates. \nIn the end, Presiding Officer Deputy Speaker Sharon Garin adopted the position of Bondoc. \nNorthern Samar Rep. Raul Daza, an anti-death penalty lawmaker, appealed Garin’s ruling, prompting Bondoc to move that this appeal be put to a vote. \nBondoc, however, clarified that the motion is to adopt a substitute bill. \nAlbay Rep. Edcel Lagman, who is against the death penalty, slammed efforts to railroad the bill in the lower chamber. He also questioned the vote, pointing out that no committee hearing has been called to approve a substitute bill and the chairman of the committee has no authority to amend the bill on his own. \n\"We should not be railroading this measure although it is a retrogressive bill because the hallmark of a deliberative assembly…is to give free reign to debates, extensive debates, so that differing positions can be heard,” Lagman said. \n“There are still so many interpellators who are ready to interpellate, provided there is a quorum. With the circulation of the list of interpellators the House leadership is estoppel.\" \nLagman said the amendments to the bill are invalid and possibly illegal because they do not have the concurrence of the House committee on justice, which he said did not have a meeting to effect the wholesale amendments. \nGarin insisted they are now in the period of voting in refusing to recognize Daza and Buhay party-list Rep. Lito Atienza who wanted to speak up. \nGarin also put the amendments to a vote despite the objections of Atienza and Daza. \nIn a \"viva voce\" vote, the amendments were adopted. \nBondoc said the majority already approved the adoption of the substitute bill. The session then adjourned. \nShare ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:20:13.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
