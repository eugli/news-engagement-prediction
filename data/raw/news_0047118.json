Maeve McDermott , USATODAY Published 12:57 p.m. ET Feb. 21, 2017 | Updated 41 minutes ago 4 Shares A post shared by CR Fashion Book (@crfashionbook) on Feb 21, 2017 at 6:04am PST \nWhile she's dabbled in music in the past, Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson won't be following in her superstar father's career footsteps. \nIn her cover story for CR Fashion Book 's new issue, Paris talked to director Lee Daniels about millennials, her Standing Rock tattoo, and most notably, her job prospects. Unfortunately for MJ fans, the 18-year-old's plans don't include pursuing music in a professional capacity. \n\"I write music for myself,\" she said. \"I use it as a way to get stuff out. It’s not something I see myself following career-wise. There are so many amazing artists in my family. If I were to do it as a career, it would change how I feel about music and I don’t want that to happen.\" \nHowever, Jackson's music-making plans may have changed in the time since she conducted the interview. Jackson told Lee Daniels that she's in a band with boyfriend, who plays drums while she sings. The quote is likely referring to her now-ex boyfriend Michael Snoddy, a drummer in the percussion ensemble Street Drum Corps. Earlier this month, Jackson and Snoddy broke up after less than a year together, E! and People reported. \nPerhaps she's referring to her rumored new flame, musician Michael Oller, with Jackson sharing a snap of their matching tattoos on Instagram.

Jackson (@parisjackson) on Feb 3, 2017 at 1:20am PST \nSpeaking of ink, Jackson also shared the stories behind some of her tattoos with Daniels, including a piece in support of Standing Rock . \n\"It’s on my ankle,\" she said. \"A member of the Sioux tribe, who is an activist and was protesting the pipeline, made the design.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:30:46.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
