(Photo: Daniel Zuchnik, WireImage) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThis may be the first time in nine years that Chris Paul wasn't voted into the NBA All-Star Game, but that doesn't mean the superstar point guard won't have a busy weekend down in New Orleans. \nPaul, who was snubbed from the Western Conference roster due to the NBA's absurd guard depth and a hand injury he suffered before the All-Star voting periods were over, is going to spend the weekend giving back to the community where he began his NBA career. \nOn Saturday, Paul, along with State Farm and the Chris Paul Family Foundation, will unveil a new technology center at the New Orleans Dryades YMCA as part of the State Farm NBA Cares Assist Tracker program. \n\"A lot of times over the years, you see different people, different guys, whoever it may be, they do endorsement deals where they just advertise their different products and that is what it is. But with State Farm, it's been a real partnership, talking about giving back,\" Paul said in a phone interview with USA TODAY Sports on Friday. \"It's more than just the Chris and Cliff commercials ... it's really about trying to get in and impact the neighborhoods and the community. \n\" ... Being in New Orleans, it's the city that sort of raised me and where I grew up. It's all about the story of coming back here and the importance of giving back and showing how to make a difference in your community.\" \nGALLERY: CHRIS PAUL THROUGH THE YEARS Facebook   2004: Wake Forest's Chris Paul, right, gives high fives to cheering students.
