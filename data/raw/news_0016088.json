Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThese days there is always the risk of a celebrity coming into the changing room after games to congratulate players. \nAnd if you play for Chelsea there is a chance that celeb could be Will Ferrell, who is well known to be a Blues fan. \n(Even though he was recently pictured at Anfield for Liverpool vs Swansea) \nBut Blues star Pedro clearly was not ready for the Anchorman star to burst into the dressing room after their 3-1 victory over Arsenal ...as the photo above shows. \nPedro is all smiles with the former Saturday Night Live legend - and Marcos Alonso - but in just his pants . \nClearly, he doesn't seem to care! \nFerrell was also snapped meeting other Chelsea stars including N'Golo Kante, Eden Hazard and Nemanja Matic; all of who remembered to wear trousers or shorts.

Reilly, who looked like he had come dressed as Sherlock Holmes' long lost step brother.
