Instagram/@joshgad \nIf you follow actor Josh Gad on Instagram you have been getting numerous entertaining videos recently of him attempting to get \"Star Wars\" spoilers out of Daisy Ridley, as the two are currently shooting the reboot of \"Murder on the Orient Express.\" \nBut his latest is his most ambitious yet. He invites Ridley (who plays Rey in the \"Star Wars\" saga) into his living room to find it filled with Hollywood A-listers who also want Ridley to dish \"Star Wars\" secrets. \nThose in on it include Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, their \"Jurassic World\" director Colin Trevorrow (who will direct \"Star Wars: Episode IX\"), as well as \"Orient Express\" costars Pen√©lope Cruz, Leslie Odom Jr. (of \"Hamilton\" fame), and Lucy Boynton. \nThough the most important question comes from Ridley's old \"The Force Awakens\" director J.J. Abrams, who really hopes Luke Skywalker has some lines in \"The Last Jedi.\" \nWatch the hilarious video below: A post shared by Josh Gad (@joshgad) on Feb 20, 2017 at 4:59am PST on Feb 20, 2017 at 4:59am PST \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:38:36.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
