(Pic: Jason Edwards) Twenty years and 20,000 deaths later, has anything really changed? \nMy son Damien died of a heroin overdose 20 years ago. The pain of his death goes on. It is a sad reality that I share with the families of around 20,000 other young Australians who have died from drugs since Damien’s death. \nThis is a national tragedy which is overlooked because, apart from their families and friends, nobody seems to really care. \nIn my case, it was devastating to see how little families were engaged by those working in public health and in particular at the time, the drug and alcohol sector. \nI will never forget the frustration and disbelief at the way I was treated while trying to somehow comprehend what had happened to my son. I was simply unprepared for the lack of information, compassion and support available for families in my situation. The stigma and shame I felt from the way I was treated was debilitating at times. But I used this to make sure that others in my situation would have their pain acknowledged and be treated much better. \nThis was the beginning of Family Drug Support and its uncompromising commitment to advocate for families. The loss of his son Damien in 1997 set Tony Trimingham on a crusade to improve the treatment of drug users’ families, and evidence based drug policy. (Pic: Supplied) \nSince then there’s been some real and progressive changes for the better of our children, families and communities. From the establishment of Australia’s first (and only) facility where people injecting drugs could do so without the high risk of overdose and death that led to Damien’s early passing, to the increased funding and recognition under John Howard for drug and alcohol services; and most importantly for me, the much greater recognition and engagement of families from people working in drug and alcohol services. \nWhat has not been so good has been the erosion of government support for not only policies and programs that reduce the potential of harm from drug use but also the support and funding available for services that help people and families with drug problems. \nThe language of a “war on drugs” that has pervaded into Australian politics since the 1990s has also been disappointing and has become unwelcome rhetoric from governments on both sides of politics. \nAustralia has moved from being a world leader in the development of drug policies and programs to one that is led by the politics of looking tough rather than accept the evidence of what works. This positioning seemed to begin in earnest when John Howard, ignoring all the available evidence, stepped in to stop a trial of heroin prescriptions for people with long term dependence. Police in Richmond, Victoria, dispose of a used needle near a primary school. Sex Party MP Fiona Patten has called for establishment of a safe injecting room in the suburb with the support of some residents. (Pic: Jason Edwards) \nSome simple and effective changes would lead to real progress. \nWe need to decriminalise the personal use of drugs so people with problematic drug use are able to engage with our health services rather than hide for fear of prosecution. \nWe must establish and build upon the innovative lifesaving programs that we know already work well — programs such as heroin prescription, injecting facilities and easier access to treatment to name a few. \nThe theme of this year’s National Family Drug Support Day is ‘See the person — not the drug’; this is what families struggling with drug issues and problems want the police and community to do. \nLet’s speak about and address drug use in the way we have learned to accept mental health, disabilities and other conditions. The impact this could have on the tens of thousands of families and lives affected by drug use would be incredible. \nTony Trimingham AO is the CEO and founder of Family Drug Support. \nFor advice and support call the 24 hour FDS toll free support line on 1300 368 186 or visit fds.org.au More News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T10:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:52:46.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
