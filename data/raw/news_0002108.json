Any time they have a problem with something, they create another problem,” she said.\n\nTrump picks Gorsuch for Supreme Court By Shane Goldmacher , Josh Gerstein and Matthew Nussbaum \nAt one point, Pelosi had an emotional exchange with a mother in the audience who said her son was killed by an undocumented immigrant. The woman wanted to know how Pelosi could support so-called “sanctuary cities,” which help shield undocumented individuals from federal immigration authorities. \n“Which one of [your children] could you look in their eyes today and tell them that they’re expendable?” the woman, Laura Wilkerson, asked Pelosi while fighting back tears. Wilkerson appeared in a campaign ad supporting Trump for his stance on immigration. \nTrump signed an order last week stripping funding from sanctuary cities as part of a broader immigration crackdown. \nPelosi, while offering sympathy for the woman’s loss, defended sanctuary cities, which she said don’t shield violent individuals, undocumented or not, from the law. \n“These are law-abiding citizens. It enables them to be there without being reported to [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] in case of another crime that they might bear witness to,” Pelosi said. \nWhite House \nHow Trump got to yes on Gorsuch By Shane Goldmacher , Eliana Johnson and Josh Gerstein \nLater, Pelosi divulged additional details about her meeting with Trump and other congressional leaders last week during which the president insisted he was robbed of the popular vote due to widespread voter fraud. \nThe California Democrat spoke up during the meeting, telling the president his widely debunked claim just wasn’t true. Trump’s response, according to Pelosi's retelling the episode on CNN: “And I’m not even counting California.” \n“You’re the president of the United States and you’re so insecure. This isn’t even true, it’s like the size of your inauguration,” Pelosi said. \nIn discussing Gorsuch, Pelosi called Trump’s Supreme Court pick “well outside the mainstream of American legal thought,” echoing criticisms of other Democrats. Trump’s announcement, also seen live on CNN, came less than an hour before her town hall, leading Pelosi to joke that he was trying to \"upstage\" her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:27:58.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
