Organized by Arun Sivag and NH Subhash Gowda ' the 18-day residency and concert tour programme will see female musicians from the US, Sweden, Spain and Nepal engage in music with independent Indian artistes, along with those from native Soliga tribe of Biligirirangana Hills. The participants will attend various workshops by musicians, entrepreneurs and photographers. The residency will take place in one of the tribal villages in Biligirirangana Hills ' at BRT Wildlife Sanctuary.\nMalabika and Sanjay of BrahmaKhyapa, who are curating the project, said, 'It will be a confluence of Indian urban and tribal and international female artistes. Five Soliga tribe women will collaborate with five female musicians from across the world to create unique music. We are waiting to see how this collaboration shapes out. G Malleshappa, working on retaining the music and tradition of Soliga tribe is the leading support of this project. The Soliga women are very excited about this project.'\nMalabika added that the Soliga tribe was chosen because it is an old tribe with a rich musical tradition.\n'Music is a mode of communication for this tribe and we want their music to reach the urban audience, and offer them the possibility of lending a unique sound to world music, and in the process go international. Apart from singers, the team comprises violinists, accordionists and flautists. As part of the project, we will create teams comprising one tribal musician, one Indian and one international musician and entrust them to compose their original music. The idea is to connect through music and not language,' she said.\nAt the end of the programme, tour concerts will be held at educational institutions in Bengaluru and Mysuru.", "external_links": ["http://www.happytrips.com/topic/nepal"], "published": "2017-02-26T16:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:50:22.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
