The lingering effects of a concussion in the 2011 Winter Classic left the Pittsburgh Penguins captain's once bright future uncertain at best.\nFor the first time in his life, the preternatural vision that helped make Crosby a star couldn't see the next move.\nReaching a thousand points? Heck, Crosby would have settled for the chance to score just once more.\n\"A lot of things go through your head as far as playing again, getting to the level you think you can get to,\" the two-time MVP said. \"A lot of sitting time around kind of waiting. It's hard for that to not kind of cross your mind.\"\nNo longer. Not with Crosby healthy and at the height of his powers for the defending Stanley Cup champions. Crosby's 30 goals lead the league and his 59 points are second only to Edmonton's Connor McDavid, who is now where Crosby was a decade ago: at the forefront of the next wave of superstars.\nThe 29-year-old Crosby remembers those giddy early days. Yet he doesn't hold them as close as the ones that left him wondering if he would ever get back on the ice with his teammates, let alone return to the form that made him the torchbearer for an entire organization as a teenager.\nSo whenever Crosby becomes the 86th member of the NHL's 1,000-point club — he had 997 heading into a visit by Calgary on Tuesday night — he'll make sure the puck ends up in his father Troy's hands for safekeeping. And with it comes an appreciation that Crosby admits he didn't always have for his own talent and the historic company he keeps.\n\"I don't feel old but I feel like there are times maybe when you're younger it's kind of an extension of junior hockey where you're used to getting certain milestones and it seems to come easy,\" Crosby said. \"I think you look at it differently as you get older. It's just something you try to enjoy a little bit more.\"\nIn a way, Crosby has come almost full circle. On Monday, Crosby and the rest of the Penguins practised in the throwback yellow helmets the team will wear during a Stadium Series game at Heinz Field against Philadelphia later this month. The game will mark the team's first visit to the home of the NFL's Steelers since Jan. 1, 2011.\nCrosby skated onto the ice that rainy night as the league's leading scorer and overwhelming frontrunner for a second Hart Trophy. He left it with his career at a crossroads following a blindside hit by Washington's David Steckel. Crosby didn't play again that season and just 22 games the next.\nIn Minnesota at the time, veteran forward Matt Cullen watched Crosby from afar and feared the worst.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/eUQziwabMKk", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/oZWBFKZ33sw"], "published": "2017-02-08T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:30:02.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
