Pictured with son Jaxon, 5, and daughter Madison, 13 \nSince first using cashback site Topcashback.co.uk two years ago, the single mum from Manchester has earned £1,200 by buying her household bills through the website, getting hundreds of pounds back on gas and electricity bills, insurance, broadband, and even takeaway food. \nThese savings, she says, allows her to push the boat out at Christmas and for birthdays, with the money saved being spent on treats for her children, including an iPad mini. \n“I’m very good with my money and apart from a car loan I don’t have any debt, and I have decent savings. \n“As a single mum I need to be careful with what I spend, and cashback sites allow me to earn money on bills I’d be spending money on anyway. \n“I’m not fickle. I won’t buy anything I don’t need, so just because there might be a good cashback offer on the website I won’t buy anything that isn’t essential.” SHOPPING DISCOUNTS How to save money off your weekly food shop, including £13 Asda cashback and £20 off Waitrose 'BLACK FRIDAY BROKE US' Cashback website Quidco crashes under surge of shoppers going online for Black Friday CONSUMER CREW Our experts tell you how to save money whether you’re buying a phone or a house best 'non cr*p' tips Parents share household secrets on Mumsnet to save you time and money Save on your shop Mumsnet reveals how YOU can cut your food bill...including having a meat-free day and eating porridge \nPaula, 40, hopes to instil this thrifty attitude towards money in her children, who both have savings accounts which aren’t allowed to be touched until they’re 17 – when the money can be used for driving lessons or their first car. \nWhile Jaxon, 5, isn’t yet old enough to properly understand the value of money, Madison, 13, gets a monthly allowance which she’s allowed to spend it on what she wants. \nEverything Madison buys, unless essential, must come out of her own bank account, her mum says. 2 Paula hopes to instil her savvy attitude towards money in her children \nPaul first came across Topcashback.co.uk in February 2016, and although skeptical at first, she soon realised that she could earn significant sums on bills she had to spend money on anyway. \nA widget on her computer means that whenever she’s shopping online, a pop-up message will let her know if she can get cashback from that retailer. \nThe only things she doesn’t get cashback on are holidays and grocery shops. \nAs a self-employed travel agent, Paula already knows how to find the best holiday deals. This year she spent £1,800 for an all-inclusive two-week trip to Benidorm for the family. How do I sign up and get cashback? \nIT’S easy to start earning casback on your bills and purchases. Just follow these simple steps: Sign up to a cashback website. Topcashback.co.uk and Quidco are two of the best. Click the ‘Join now’ option and enter your email address and password Make sure you click the free / basic membership option, otherwise you’ll be charged. If you want premium membership, both websites charge £5 a month for this. The premium membership will reward customers with bonus cashback, ad-free shopping and quicker payouts Find a deal that you want to purchase, whether that’s a home insurance policy, a new laptop from Currys, or a Tesco grocery shop. Instead of going directly to the retailer, you can access the shop through a link in the cashback website, and any purchase made will be registered with the cashback site. You still receive your item directly from the retailer, and the casback earned will be added to your online account. Once it’s there, you can withdraw it and transfer it to your bank account, or you can turn your cashback into a gift voucher or code to spend at a retailer. Bear in mind that it can take a few days or even weeks for the cashback to appear in your account on the website. \nShe also does her weekly grocery shop in Aldi, but bulk-buys items including toilet paper and washing-up liquid to keep costs down. \nShe said: “Having children is expensive, so it’s important I do what I can to keep my expenses low. I’ve now encouraged my mum to start using cashback sites and she’s already earned £39.” \nAccording to Topcashback.co.uk, which has six million users, members earn an average £325 a year with an average rate of 7.5 per cent across retailers. \nSome of the cashback currently being offered includes up to £200 cashback for BT broadband, up to 15 percent cashback on Argos purchases, and up to 12 per cent cashback on Groupon. Three cashback safety rules \nTHERE are certain things to be aware of when buying on a cashback website. Cashback isn’t guaranteed. Sometimes link tracking problems occur and customers (and sometimes the cashback site itself) isn’t paid by the retailer. If you’re expecting to be paid and you aren’t, make sure to contact the cashback site Cashback sites should be free – don’t use one that charges for use Once the cash is in your online account, withdraw it straight away (once you’ve hit the minimum amount at which you can withdraw funds) and transfer it to your bank account. That’s because if the company goes bust, your money goes with it. \nWe pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?
