Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email The company behind a viral video apparently showing a cat-calling victim ripping the wing mirror from a white van man's vehicle has admitted not everything is as it seems.\nIn the video, the van driver shouts over to a female cyclist: \"Alright, want my number?\" - and she is later asked: \"You on your period?\"\nThe 'enraged cyclist' later responds by pulling up alongside the vehicle, with two men inside, and yanking its wing mirror off.\nBut after witnesses began claiming the video was actually staged by a camera crew, the company responsible for distributing it made a humiliating admission.\nPaul Beiboer, the boss of Jungle Creations, which claims to \"create and curate the best content on the internet\", said his firm handed out the footage \"under the impression that it portrayed real-life events\", but now believes the video may be \"factually incorrect\".\nThe woman grabs the wing mirror and tears it off the van (Photo: Viral Thread) The footage is made to look as though it was filmed by a motorcyclist's helmet camera (Photo: Viral Thread) Jungle Creations said in a statement: \"It has come to our attention that a video distributed on our Facebook channel Viral Thread on February 21, 2017 may be factually incorrect.\n\"Contrary to reports, we want to make clear that we were in no way involved in the making or production of this video.\n\"The video was received from a third-party content provider and it was distributed on Viral Thread under the impression that it portrayed real-life events.\n\"We rigorously vet all content received from third parties to ascertain its credibility, but unfortunately our usual high standards were not met on this video.\nThe woman asks the men in the van to leave her alone (Photo: Viral Thread) \"We are committed to ensuring and protecting the integrity of content on our channels and take matters of this nature extremely seriously. We’ve since started an internal investigation to make sure it doesn’t happen again.\"\nJungle Creations refused to name the \"third-party content provider\" that supplied the footage.\nKareem Naaman said on social media after the footage went viral: \"This is fake and was filmed by actors. Mate of mine saw it all being filmed. \n\"Not sure who or why, but interested to find out what it was for.\"\nThe incident, which was reportedly caught by the helmet camera of a motorcyclist travelling behind the woman on the bike, appears to start when the van stops at a set of traffic lights.\nThe man leans out of the van and tries to touch the cyclist (Photo: Viral Thread) The woman immediately tells the men to go away after they ask for her number and hits the side of their van, knocking the wing mirror out of place.\nIn reaction to the cyclist , the man says: \"That's not very ladylike is it? What charm school did you go to?\"\nHave your say on this story Comment Below Moments later, he adds: \"Shut up you old dog, you on your period?\n\"Listen don't be like that, come on. Give me your number.\"\nAt one stage, the man even leans out of the van and attempts to touch the cyclist on the arm.\nThe passenger asks the cyclist if she is on her period (Photo: Viral Thread) Read More Driver SCREAMS in horror as he collides with 'drunk' man in middle of unlit road As the light changes to green, the van sets off with the woman on the bike pursuing them furiously.\nAs they pull up in a lay-by, the woman brakes sharply, grabs their wing mirror and tears it off the van.\nWatching the whole incident, the motorcyclist then also pulls up alongside the woman and shouts to the two men inside the vehicle: \"That's exactly what you deserve, you scum!\"\nThe woman appears infuriated with the man's comments (Photo: Viral Thread) The woman appears at first to ignore the comments made by the men (Photo: Viral Thread) Jungle Creations initially denied the clip was a staged 'social experiment' and claimed the footage was supplied by an unnamed third party, which insisted it was real.\nJungle Creations is described on its website as \"an online media house\", adding: \"We create content and distribute it to our online followers.\"\nBut Christopher Robert Wilson said on social media: \"Staged beyond belief, another 'social experiment' people have [fallen] for hook, line and sinker. Jungle Creations have got themselves a nice little money maker!\"\nThe woman throws the wing mirror on the floor (Photo: Viral Thread) The clip was posted on Facebook where it has been watched more than 10 million times .\nOne viewer wrote in a comment: \"'You on your period?' Sure, because the only POSSIBLE explanation for this (or any) woman not swooning at your car door from your disgusting, sexually predatory actions and words is her menstrual cycle.\"\nAnother added: \"The guy on the motorcycle had it right. They deserved it. And it's just a van. It is property. They were trying to touch and intimidate her. She's a human being.\"\nThe motorcyclist tells the men they got what they deserved (Photo: Viral Thread) Read More BMW passenger hurls bottle at a driver's windscreen in 'unprovoked road rage attack' But one viewer disagreed, writing: \"Jail her! Criminal damage to property.\"\nA spokesman for Jungle Creations said earlier today, before making its humiliating admission: \"The syndication arm Jungle Creations asked the content creator for verification that this incident was true and they received this confirmation.\"\nPolice were unable to find the incident on their records.\nLike us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Daily newsletter Enter email Subscribe Comments Show more comments More On Viral Cyclists Vehicles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:23:01.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
