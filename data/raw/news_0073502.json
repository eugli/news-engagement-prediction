Image: larry busacca/Getty Images By Emma Hinchliffe 2017-02-25 22:45:43 UTC \nPresident Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that he won't attend this year's White House Correspondents' Dinner for, uh, no reason. \nMaybe the White House foresaw that Trump's skills might not lie in his comedy routines ? Maybe Trump remembered how the last few dinners that mentioned him went? Or maybe he wanted to be the one to back out before every other media organization could cancel ? I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 \nWhatever the cause, Twitter was pretty happy: . @realDonaldTrump PARTY'S BACK ON! \n— Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) February 25, 2017 Lol. That's like not being asked to go to the prom and then telling everyone you didn't want to go anyway. https://t.co/q0UIfDB6Uq \n— Katie Jacobs Stanton (@KatieS) February 25, 2017 @realDonaldTrump Can President Bannon come in your place? \n— Kristina Wong ❄️ (@mskristinawong) February 25, 2017 i also will not be attending the white house correspondents association dinner please wish every body well and have a great evening ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:51:39.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
