I want to put an end to his career.\" Photo: Danny Green says he wants to retire on top. (AAP: David Mariuz) \nGreen has hosed down talk of a rematch, saying he is happy to retire a winner. \nMundine says he is keen to fight Green with the right referee who will allow the two veterans to go at it on the inside and the outside. \n\"Ninety per cent of the people that know boxing know that I won the fight,\" Mundine said. \n\"Even his fans were coming up to me after the fight saying I won the fight. \n\"I'm not talking one or two people, I'm talking everyone that I run into.\" \nMundine said he wants to fight Green at 83 kilograms, four heavier than what he weighed during the Adelaide bout. \nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:28:08.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
