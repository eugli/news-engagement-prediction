Literally. \nAccording to Florida Today , local fishermen have become so pissed off at other anglers invading their space and tangling their fishing lines that they have resorted to some rather barbaric tactics to keep them away, and that apparently includes…wait for it…taking a dump and then wiping their feces along the pier railing. Florida Men Are Apparently Smearing Their Own Poop On Pier Rails So Nobody Will Fish Next To Them Photo: Moment Open (Getty) \n“We’ve had reports of people defecating and spreading it on the rail to mark their territory so nobody will fish next to them,” said Martin Smithson, administrator for the Sebastian Inlet District. “There have been several citations for public urination.” \nAnother “territorial tactic” is the flinging of lead fishing weights not only at boaters who come too close to pier but also other fishermen on the pier, and some of those sinkers have wound up being direct hits that resulted in people getting injured. \n“There’s been two that I know of in the last six months where people have been treated and gone to the hospital,” Smithson said. \nStill, nothing seems to be as disturbing as taking a shit and then smearing it along the railing. I mean, even for Florida Man , that’s pretty fucking gross.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:46:49.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
