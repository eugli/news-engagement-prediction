starting to cost the Palm Beach Sheriff's Department a pretty penny.\nIn an interview with the Palm Beach Post , Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said that just over $1.5million has been spent by the department on overtime to pay police officers when President Trump is in town.\nHe also said that the Palm Beach Sheriff's Department has not been reimbursed for any of this money by the federal government.\nAt the same time, there are complaints that businesses at the Lantana airport are losing tens of thousands of dollars each time President Trump comes to town as the airfield has been shut down by Secret Service.\nThat could ultimately cost these businesses as much as $2million a year according to one estimate.\nMeanwhile, President Trump will reportedly be returning to Palm Beach this weekend.\nScroll down for video\nWinter White House: President Trump has made four trips to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach since he won the election (above arriving in Florida with First Lady Melania and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last Friday)\nExpensive endeavor: The visits have cost the Palm Beach Sheriff's Department over $1.5million in overtime (police above guarding President trump's route on Saturday)\nKeeping the streets protected: Sheriff Bradshaw was quick to point out that local law enforcement is not compromised when President Trump comes to town\nPresident Trump's first visit to Mar-a-Lago after winning the election occurred over Thanksgiving and lasted five days.\nSheriff Bradshaw said that this trip was initially thought to cost $250,000, but that has now been adjusted to roughly $300,000.\nThat is how the Sheriff's Department was able to estimate that it would cost about $60,000 a day when President Trump is in town.\nWest Palm Beach Chief Financial Officer Mark Parks also estimated that city police and fire-rescue personnel crews have incurred about $26,000 in overtime costs.\nSheriff Bradshaw was quick to point out that local law enforcement is not compromised when President Trump comes to town, hence the overtime payments to those who have not already been scheduled to work at that time.\n'We don’t take anybody off the road that handles normal calls for service,' said Sheriff Bradshaw.\nHe did however admit that he has not actually spoken to anyone at this time about being reimbursed for President Trump's visits.\n'I’m very confident that we’re going to get reimbursed,' said Sheriff Bradshaw.\n'There’ll be a point in time where I’ll have a conversation, I hope, with the president personally or with someone high up in the administration.'\nBig Apple: New York City is in an even more difficult position, and reportedly spending $1million every single day to protect the First Lady and son Barron while they live in the city\nCostly: President Trump's visits cost approximately $60,000 a day, and the Sheriff's Department has not been reimbursed by the federal government (police at a rally on feb.4 in Palm Beach)\nMore money: West Palm Beach Chief Financial Officer Mark Parks also estimated that city police and fire-rescue personnel crews have incurred about $26,000 in overtime costs\nNew York City is in an even more difficult position, and reportedly spending $1million every single day to protect the First Lady and son Barron while they live in the city.\nThose with business ties to the Lantana airport are a bit more concerned however, and hoping that President Trump figures out a new way to travel soon.\n'What are we going to do here when he’s here for two weeks? Thanksgiving? Christmas and New Year’s?' said private plane owner Kelly Gottlieb .\n'If he’s here for a long period of time, I think this airport is in dire straits.'\nTrump was in Palm Beach for over two weeks during the holidays, arriving on December 16 and not departing until New Year's Day.\nSome say that their livelihoods are now in danger because of President Trump.", "external_links": ["http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/local-govt--politics/pbso-overtime-million-and-growing-trump-set-return-again/vHLcu2XCR2XgLZ9Clzr8hP/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-14T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:30:41.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
