So I decided to stop and rest awhile at the Bukit Gantang Rest and Service Area. \n“The last thing I remember, I kept the engine and air-conditioning on as I wanted to close my eyes for a bit,” she said. \nThe former Behrang Polytechnic student could not have expected that she would only wake up three months later. \nShe was first sent to Taiping Hospital, where her struggle to gain consciousness started, before being transferred to Sultanah Bahiyah Hospital, Alor Setar, when it was confirmed that she was suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning. \n“All along when I was in a coma, I could hear and see whatever transpired. But I could not give any response. My whole body was locked,” said the youngest of six siblings. \nShe said although she was not responding, her parents did not give up and kept talking to her, , asking her to blink, cry or grip their hands if she came to. \n“I don't know how, but I fought the lock shackling me and eventually regained consciousness,” she said. \nShe said doctors were shocked, as during the period she was in a coma, medical specialists did not expect her to live long, especially after seeing the results of a scan. \n“What’s more, when I was found unconscious, the oxygen level in my body was only 20%. Doctors said my case was a miracle because I have no permanent brain damage except for some slightly affected nerves, especially in the leg. I also lost my voice for awhile,” she said. \nShe said to date, doctors still could not identify what had happened to the nerves on her leg. \nHaving to use a walking stick and suffering the occasional pain has not prevented Ummi Diyana from leading a normal life as a first-year student in entrepreneurship at UUM with 515 other students, from Feb 6. \nIn fact, she said she has no qualms about going back behind the wheel and had already done so without problems after being confirmed healthy. \n“The experience of coming back from the dead has clearly changed my perspective on life. \n“So I will use this opportunity to do my best. I want to succeed in studies and change my life,” she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:52:22.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
