Sunday morning brought the East-West Line breakdown between Joo Koon and Boon Lay. Today, the breakdown is at North-South Line from Jurong East to Ang Mo Kio. \nThought the government recenty announced that the MRT had all sleepers replaced in the East-West and North-South Lines? How come breakdown again? How are they going to explain it this time? Cunstomer satisfaction at the highest level in recent years? What a joke! \nAnd still, transport costs will keep rising, while breakdowns will still happen freqeuntly. 'Surveys' will still show high level of customers satisfaction. What a joke! \nRoger Low \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
