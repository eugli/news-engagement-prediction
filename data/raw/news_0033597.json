Frank was killed on Feb. 9 inside a bedroom at the home he shared with Malissa, according to a probable cause statement, the paper reported. According to authorities, Malissa Ancona said that her biological son shot her husband, who was sleeping, in the head.\nAuthorities obtained a search warrant and found extensive blood in the master bedroom on Feb. 11, the Daily Journal reported.\n© Facebook Frank Ancona, the self-proclaimed “imperial wizard” of a KKK chapter near St. Louis, was found dead in a Missouri river on Saturday, Feb. 11, 2017. Officials first learned of the 51-year-old's disappearance on Friday, a day after a United States Federal Forest Service employee discovered Ancona’s car on Federal Forest Service Property, Jacobsen said in a Facebook post.\nAuthorities searched the area, but Ancona’s body was not found until Saturday when a family that was fishing found his remains on the river bank, The Park Hills Daily Journal reported.\nLeadwood Police Chief William Dickey told the Daily Journal that Ancona was last seen by his wife on Wednesday morning. Dickey said Malissa Ancona told authorities that husband told her he was driving across state lines to deliver a part for work.\n© Provided by New York Daily News The Daily Journal reported that Malissa told authorities her husband packed a bag and said he wanted a divorce when he returned from his work trip.

Let me tell you they are the haters. They have engaged in a campaign to destroy our Race, culture, and heritage.”\nFollow Mary Bowerman on Twitter: @MaryBowerman\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmRa2S%3focid%3dst&text=KKK+leader+found+dead+in+%27senseless+act+of+violence%27%3a+police&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmRa2S%3focid%3dst", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmRa2S&lang=en-us&flow_id=67ce772c-6137-4b1d-8b5a-158d80355ef3", "https://twitter.com/MaryBowerman", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmRa2S?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmRa2S?blobrefkey=104&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1280&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;720&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://dailyjournalonline.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/authorities-recover-remains-of-ancona-investigation-continues/article_1121f39f-1a26-5134-855b-e1f0e3743c81.html", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmRa2S?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmRa2S?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmRa2S?blobrefkey=103&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1024&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;576&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/29b2aba5-", "https://traditionalistamericanknights.com/Imperial_Wizard.html", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmRa2S%3focid%3dsl&title=KKK+leader+found+dead+in+%27senseless+act+of+violence%27%3a+police&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmRa2S%3focid%3dsl", "http://www.time.com/", "http://feed.timeincvideo.com/f/Qa0iQC/msn_time&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerName&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA3e1oO.img", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmRdwv.img&quot;}}", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/29b2aba5-ea20-4e0f-93a3-4f0e1a3f5591/7adee121-d3f8-4684-b114-fcf4be7cae2c.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonCoSheriffsOffice/?fref=nf", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA2oHEB.img"], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:02:52.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
