Hunters who accidentally shot one another blamed illegal immigrants \nMatthews struck Miss Bi, who moved to the UK from China to study aged 15, with dozens of blows after seeing what he wrongly believed to be a message from Tinder on her phone. \nMiss Bi, also 24, suffered 41 injuries including massive bruising and multiple fractures in the prolonged assault that started at 1.30am on August 19 last year at their flat in Llandaff, Cardiff, South Wales. \nBy 8.30am she had collapsed due to her injuries, which included a broken jaw and ribs – only then did Matthews call 999.

Peru Two Michaella McCollum hits the beach for some informal unposed bikini photos \nMatthews’ claim he had not intended to hurt Miss Bi was dismissed by a jury who found him guilty of murder. \nSentencing at Cardiff Crown Court, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies said the assault was the ‘tragic culmination’ of physical and verbal abuse over a number of months. \nShe said of Miss Bi’s inability to speak out about what was happening to her, even while in hospital with injuries inflicted by Matthews: ‘Nothing better demonstrates the fear that you engendered in this educated and intelligent young woman than her inability to tell of your abusive conduct.’ Xixi’s family say they have lost their heart (Picture: Wales News Service) \nMatthews and Miss Bi met in April 2015, when he was unemployed. The court heard how Xixi, the daughter of wealthy parents in China, provided him with a home, clothing, and even a car. \nMrs Justice Davies described how as the months went on, Xixi become quieter, thinner and more withdrawn and how neighbours heard Matthews shouting at her. Peggy, 96, has been volunteering at a homeless shelter for 80 years \nThey told the court they heard him say things such as: ‘I don’t want to do this, I’ve got to punish you for what you have done’ and: ‘If you don’t suck my dick I’m going to hit you.’ \nMiss Bi was seen to have black eyes and was forced to resit a year of her course after missing deadlines.
