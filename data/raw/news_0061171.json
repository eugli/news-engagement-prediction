What she loves is that it bounces, and keeps on bouncing. \nDogs have many things to teach us humans. They take things in their stride, they shake off the past as though it didn't happen, and they're powered by the high-octane fuel of optimism. Lessons to us all! \nBut one of their best and wisest lessons is to take pleasure in simple things. A simple thing like a stick, a simple thing like a ball. Endless fun can be had in the company of the most unsophisticated object - there's just no need to complicate things. \nHere's a collection of reader photos of their dogs wrapped up in the joy of simple things. Scroll and enjoy - the final one will make your day. Four Legs Good - Nick Barnett writes about pets \nThanks to all for sharing pictures.

Ad Feedback \nThe ball thuds a little on the wet sand, but Jess couldn't be happier anyway. \nSometimes you need to give the ball a rest, let it get its breath back. Joss gives it a minute. \nOh yeah, Bow (left) is fully ready to play. And Jilly's just getting to know her ball - it'll seem smaller soon. \nToday's pictures are full of classic dog expressions, and here are two. Diezel (left) and Kya are super-proud of their toys. \nHappiness tinged with pride: Rusty (left) and Sid. \nA ball is still a wonderful thing even when air has left its body. Mollie (left) and Skye honour the lost bounciness. \nThere's a species of simple dog toy that has one main quality: it won't come apart when pulled. Quinn and Grievous subject such a toy to their rigorous testing regime. \nThree rangy canines who adore their simple toys: Gus with his rope toy, Luca with his two chews, and Ralph with his bone toy, frozen in ice to keep him cool on a summer day. \nCoby (left) and Indy make it clear which is their favourite toy. \nWhat is happiness? It's a rubber burger for Jasper and a sturdy rope knot for Otis. \nLatte (left) stole a chew during a visit to the vet. Lulu bestows affection and a little drool on her best ball. \nKovu's owners don't know where that Kong came from. It just appeared one day, in Kovu's mouth, where it has spent a lot of time since. \nTo Isla it's all the same: a shop-bought soft toy, or the core of a toilet roll. She's an equal opportunity chewer. \nAnother toilet roll lover is Simba (left). Izzy is a stick obsessive - even a twig can get her excited. \nFor some dogs a mere stick is insufficient - they need a significant chunk of tree to be happy. As Luna is. \nBrina has her prize. Now she's looking for Tom Walsh or Val Adams to throw it. \nZinny has to do some rebalancing to move with that hunk of driftwood. \nMore unfeasibly large chunks of wood and their proud owners: Brutus (left) and Loki. \nHey Meg, Gandalf wants his wizard staff back. \nToday's disproportionate stick champion has to be Stanley. \nFinally, a dog whose name I don't know. A reader sent this photo last night that represents true devotion to a loved pet. A dog who can't walk gets taken each day to the beach, lifted up and down the steps and then pushed along in a cunning carriage. Doggy gets to take in the smells and feel the waves. And of course, the stick comes too. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:02:25.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
