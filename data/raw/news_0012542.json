For each of this chemotherapy, the patient has to travel all the way to hospitals,\" said Ramakant Deshpande, Oncosurgeon and Vice Chairman of Asian Cancer Institute. \nAccessibility to quality cancer care is a challenge in our country and smart cancer centres intend to address the same,\" Deshpande said.
