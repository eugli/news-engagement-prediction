And what is happening here should be seen in the context of a wider backlash in Europe against Muslim migrants. In France, the Right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen is riding high in the polls ahead of the election in April. In Holland, the Right-wing, anti-Muslim Geert Wilders is leading the polls just weeks before a general election. These are disturbing, if sadly not surprising, developments in the agonised debate over the great migration of recent times. Viktor Orban, the country’s prime minister, has positioned himself as the defender of Europe’s Christian tradition It is a debate in which Hungary is utterly uncompromising. To understand why, one must understand how Hungary’s bitter opposition to Muslims, stretching back centuries to the invasion and occupation by Ottoman Muslim rulers for 150 years until 1699. Ever since, it has seen itself as a bulwark against Islamic inroads into Europe. The recent mass migration of people from the Middle East and beyond has now inflamed those deep-rooted cultural tensions once more. Along with the crackdown on the border and the banning of Muslims, Hungary is also planning to hold all migrants not sent back to Serbia in detention centres until their legal claims have been assessed. ‘We are going to introduce new measures: no migrants, not even those who have already issued their request for asylum, can move freely, whether they are entitled to political asylum, refugee status or anything else,’ said Zoltán Kovács, a Hungarian government minister. Predicting that Hungary’s crackdown will go down ‘like a bomb’ in Brussels, the government has vowed to defy the Schengen agreement, which allows the free movement of people in the so-called Schengen area, of which Hungary is a part. Hungary is also planning to hold all migrants not sent back to Serbia in detention centres until their legal claims have been assessed The move to detain migrants will spark a huge battle with the European Union, which states that claimants should ‘not be held in detention for the sole reason that he or she is seeking international protection’, and can only be detained under ‘clearly defined exceptional circumstances’. This week, Hungarian ministers laughed off such claims, saying that migrants would be free to leave Hungary after being arrested — as long as they were heading back to their home countries, which would mean they were not, technically, being detained. In the meantime, the police and the mayor’s patrols are doing their utmost to make life as grim as possible for anyone who attempts to cross the border illegally. The result of this implacable attitude has been that thousands of migrants, stuck in Serbia, have congregated in its capital city, Belgrade. There, as distressing pictures over recent weeks have revealed, adults and children alike are struggling to survive in the freezing depths of a Balkan winter. However, the most intrepid young men are determined to prevail, and this week I found a large group of them sheltering in an old brick-making factory near the Hungarian border. A new law in Hungary says that anyone caught within five miles of the border on the Hungarian side will not be allowed to claim asylum After paying smugglers to take them from their homes in Pakistan and Afghanistan, more than 130 of them had congregated around fires to keep the bitter cold at bay and to cook food over open flames. Like hundreds of thousands before them who have made the journey successfully, these young men — there are no women or children with them — are a determined bunch: they have their hearts set on a new life in Britain, France or Germany. In between cooking and chatting on their smartphones to relatives back home, these men told me they were utterly convinced that, as long as they kept trying, they would soon be enjoying free housing and all the attendant benefits of Western Europe. No one I spoke to was fleeing war or imminent death. Instead, they were simply hellbent on reaching ‘rich’ countries where they believe they will be miraculously provided with a life beyond their wildest dreams. Most had paid fortunes to people smugglers to make the journey to the Hungarian border. The going rate from Pakistan and Afghanistan ranges from £5,000 to £8,000 — the price varies according to the laws of supply and demand — and is part of an elaborate and highly organised network that takes them to Europe. ‘I paid 10,000 U.S. dollars to a man whose name I was given by relatives, who had also made the journey,’ said another man who gave his name as Amir and said he was 25. In one year, just 16 people have been allowed asylum in Hungary out of more than 180,000 claims These men are all too aware of a new law in Hungary which says that anyone caught within five miles of the border on the Hungarian side will not be allowed to claim asylum, and will instead be sent back to Serbia. Camps are being built to detain those who make it further. Not surprisingly, such moves have prompted much controversy, with leftist groups, human rights organisations and liberal politicians all condemning the crackdown, which has seen just 16 people allowed asylum in Hungary in one year out of more than 180,000 claims. ‘Once, we were surrounded by an iron curtain that prevented people from crossing the borders,’ one pro-migrant activist told me. ‘Now we are putting up our own new walls and stopping others crossing the borders. Everyone knows migration is a huge issue, but this is not humane and is not the solution.’ Yet ordinary people I spoke to in Asotthalom appeared to be overwhelmingly supportive of their mayor’s stance, and are pleased that their government is also increasingly copying his policies. The mayor’s own heavily fortified house sits on a plot of land directly opposite the new border fence which runs between his town and Serbia — and has a sign, beside a picture of a pistol, warning in three languages that the area is protected by guns and dogs. Ordinary people in Asotthalom appeared to be overwhelmingly supportive of their mayor’s stance His wife, Mihaela, a Romanian, told me the mayor was out of the country. I asked her what she thought of migrants. With three giant boerbull guard dogs at her side, she smiled and said: ‘You must ask my husband.’ At the town’s only cafe, people told me they did not want foreigners coming to their town and spoiling their way of life. ‘These Islamic people are no good,’ one man in overalls told me, as his friends sipped beer and nodded. ‘They should go back to where they are from.’ But there is little chance of that. Back at the brick-making factory, the migrants were determined to do all they could to get through the steel fence and security patrols. One man said he had tried to get through the fence 21 times in recent weeks. Along with a group of fellow migrants from Pakistan, he bought boltcutters and sliced through the razor wire as recently as last week. He was caught and, he says, beaten up by police, lifting his shirt to show me where he said his ribs had been broken. ‘I won’t give up,’ he smiled grimly. ‘There is nothing for me in Pakistan, and my life will be good in Europe.’ As others asked me for advice on how to claim asylum in Britain, a man from Afghanistan told me that his friends and family sent him cash by Western Union money transfer any time he ran short — but that all he wanted to do was get into Europe via Hungary and then on to London, where food vouchers, accommodation and free health care are provided to those seeking asylum. ‘I have people there that I know,’ he said. ‘I will wait here as long as it takes. One day, the guards will not catch me and I will be gone from here for ever. Maybe I will see you in London one day, my friend.’ I didn’t have the heart to tell him, but the truth is that he may never get anywhere near Britain. Not if Mayor Toroczkai has anything to do with it.
