Yahoo said in its September announcement that “an unauthorised third party accessed the company’s proprietary code to learn how to forge cookies.” \nYahoo’s spokesperson sent the following statement in response to this story: \n“As we have previously disclosed, our outside forensic experts have been investigating the creation of forged cookies that could have enabled an intruder to access our users’ accounts without a password. The investigation has identified user accounts for which we believe forged cookies were taken or used. Yahoo is in the process of notifying all potentially affected account holders. Yahoo has invalidated the forged cookies so they cannot be used again.” \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
