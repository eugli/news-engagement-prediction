If electricity is given uninterrupted in Ramzan, then it should be given in Diwali without a break. Bhedbhaav nahin hona chahiye (there should be no discrimination.” \nIt was obviously meant to underline the ruling Samajwadi Party’s alleged minority appeasement policy.

The SP is strong and the BSP is trying to gain an edge through Dalit-Muslim consolidation in its favour. The Ansari brothers – jailed gangster Mukhtar and Afzal – have influence in parts of Mau, Varanasi and Ghazipur. They are helping Mayawati this time. \n4) With demonetisation as a poll plank not showing expected results and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav -- in alliance with Rahul Gandhi -- perceived to be appealing to the youth, the BJP has been forced to rake up its old Hindutva rhetoric. \n5) The BJP is banking on its traditional supporters among upper castes and consolidation of non-Yadav OBC votes. Appeal to Hindutva sentiments is expected to help the BJP in bringing different castes under a Hindutva umbrella.
