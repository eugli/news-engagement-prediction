Player Ratings: Liverpool v Tottenham Saturday, 11th February 2017 LIVERPOOL beat Tottenham 2-0 at Anfield this evening, but how did each individual get on? 1 / 15 Liverpool FC Liverpool: Team average - 7 “It was almost an ‘us against the world’ type of attitude and we will do anything for each other” Liverpool player Adam Lallana \n“We were backs against the wall. It was the team captain who got us together. Big credit to Jordan. He wanted it to happen and it was great responsibility from him, acting as a captain. \n“It wasn’t just him who spoke, the senior players spoke, the non-senior players, everyone. It was good, it was refreshing. \n“Yes we are in a difficult place and, at times, it feels like it is us against the world when things aren’t going well. \n“It was very open and I came out of that meeting knowing that every one of those players are together and intent on turning things around as quickly as possible. \n“It was almost an ‘us against the world’ type of attitude and we will do anything for each other, work our socks off, for it to change as quickly as possible. \n“We knew things would change, it was just a matter of time, it was up to us to show when it would change. There can be no more excuses.” \nThat change was evident from the start at Anfield on Saturday as the intensity the Reds have been missing in recent weeks was back. \nThey were ahead in the 16th minute after a stunning pass from Georginio Wijnaldum put Mane through and he lifted the ball over Hugo Lloris. \nJust two minutes later and Mane found the net again, this time after a mistake from Eric Dier with Lloris blocking twice before the ball eventually fell to the Senegal star to lash home. \nThe one big criticism remains though – they can do it against the big teams yet their attitude playing the so called smaller sides is still in question.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:35:36.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
