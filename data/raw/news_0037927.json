Wall Street has celebrated President Trump's stimulus plans as well as strength in the American economy. \nBut the latest gains have come in the face of drama in the White House that threatens to derail or at least delay Trump's promises for huge tax cuts and deregulation. \nLast week, Trump's immigration executive order was dealt a legal blow, and the president has been dogged this week by the controversy over the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn. \nAnd then just as U.S. markets were closing at record highs on Wednesday, restaurant CEO Andrew Puzder withdrew as Trump's labor secretary nominee amid resistance from the U.S. Senate. \n\"So far, you have to conclude the market doesn't care,\" said Yardeni. \"But at some point the market might care.\" \nRelated: Nasdaq notches longest record streak since '99 \nWall Street is apparently betting that tax cuts and deregulation are still coming, because despite Trump's troubles, Republicans still control the White House and Congress. \nFederal Reserve chief Janet Yellen agrees that Wall Street is reacting to these stimulus plans, especially on the tax side. \nU.S. stocks received another boost on Wednesday after Trump said at a meeting with retail CEOs his administration is \" doing a massive tax plan . It's going very well.\" \nAsked on Wednesday why stocks have gone up, Yellen said investors are \"likely anticipating shifts in fiscal policy that will stimulate growth and perhaps raise earnings.\" \nWall Street is also hoping that a corporate tax overhaul will encourage companies like Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) and Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) to bring that money sitting overseas back to America for dividends, mergers and real investment. \nRelated: Trump isn't killing the bull market. Here's why \nBut how long can this rally really last? \nRyan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, warned that in the short term, \"things could have gotten a little overdone\" in the markets. \nBut he said the \"broad-based strength\" of the rally, which includes small and medium-sized stocks, \"bodes well for future gains.\" \nFor now, investors don't seem bothered by Trump's less business-friendly campaign ideas. That includes a tough stance on trade that could spark a trade war, promises to break up the banks and threats to the independence of the Federal Reserve. \n\"Love him or hate him, the market is focusing on the bullish aspects of Trump's plan,\" Yardeni said, \"and dismissing the potential bearish ones.\" CNNMoney (New York) First published February 15, 2017: 4:59 PM ET", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:15:38.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
