He said on At The Races: \"I've a collapsed lung and six broken ribs on my right side. \n\"I'm obviously devastated to miss the festival - there were so many good horses to look forward to, as JP's team all look in particularly good shape this year.\" \nDescribing his current state, he said: \"Last night was pretty rough. I've broken ribs individually before but never had six go all at the same time. I'll be in hospital for a few more days but once the lung improves my recovery should be straightforward and I expect to be back for Aintree.\" \nGeraghty will be denied the opportunity to choose between Stan James Champion Hurdle market leaders Buveur D'Air and Yanworth on the opening day of the festival. \nMcManus's racing manager Frank Berry expressed his disappointment at the news of his injuries, but suggested that it was too early to consider who might replace Geraghty on the various big-race fancies. \n\"It's bad luck on Barry,\" Berry said from Naas. \"I've only just heard myself. We were hoping it would be good news we would be hearing, so we haven't had a chance to digest it. \n\"Barry hadn't even made up his mind as to what he was going to ride in a lot of the races, so we have no idea at this stage who'll ride what.\" Unowhatimeanharry: one of the plum rides Barry Geraghty will miss PICTURE: Mark Cranham (racingpost.com/photos) \nMark Walsh, who operates as McManus's second choice rider in Ireland, is likely to be one of the chief beneficiaries of Geraghty's misfortune when it comes to the raiding party, with Jessica Harrington's 2014 Champion Hurdle hero Jezki due to take in either the Champion Hurdle or the Sun Bets Stayers' Hurdle. \nThat said, it is the choice Champion Hurdle mounts Buveur D'Air and Yanworth who will have Geraghty's potential replacements salivating. \nNoel Fehily, who rode Buveur D'Air throughout last season and who has called upon by Henderson to deputise aboard Altior when Nico de Boinville was injured, is an obvious contender to regain the ride on the 7-2 market leader. \nAidan Coleman, who rides regularly for McManus and partnered Buveur D'Air in both of his starts during his aborted chasing career, is also sure to be in the mix for many of the British-based McManus horses. \nFehily may also be in the front rank for Stayers' Hurdle favourite Unowhatimeanharry, as he was the regular partner of Harry Fry's charge last term. Defi Du Seuil: is favourite for the JCB Triumph Hurdle PICTURE: Edward Whitaker (racingpost.com/photos) \nOnly Geraghty and his predecessor AP McCoy have ridden Yanworth over hurdles, while the mount on King's Ryanair Chase-bound Uxizandre is also now up for grabs. \nThe plum mount on Defi Du Seuil, hot favourite to stretch his unbeaten record over hurdles to six in the JCB Triumph, may well return to champion jockey Richard Johnson, who partnered Philip Hobbs's classy four-year-old to Grade 1 success at Chepstow on December 27. \nGeraghty had been cut for the Festival's leading award, which he has won twice before, in recent weeks. He traded at as low as 7-4 before he was hurled into the ground at Kempton, but Ruby Walsh has since hardened from 4-7 to 2-5. \nPaddy Power cut Johnson from 25-1 to 16-1, and the same firm now have Coleman as clear second favourite at 7-1 from 12-1. Power introduced Mark Walsh at 12-1. \nGeraghty's absence means his remarkable festival record will be temporarily stalled. With 34 winners amassed at the four-day bonanza, the County Meath native is the second most successful rider in the history of the meeting, behind Walsh. \nA dual Gold Cup winner aboard Kicking King and Bobs Worth, he has won five Champion Chases (twice on Moscow Flyer and also on Big Zeb, Finian's Rainbow and Sprinter Sacre) and two Champion Hurdles, taking the opening day feature aboard Punjabi and Jezki. \nSince plundering his breakthrough success on Moscow Flyer in the 2002 Arkle Trophy, Geraghty has ridden at least one winner at 15 consecutive festivals. Sadly, he won't be able to add to that remarkable sequence next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:30:21.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
