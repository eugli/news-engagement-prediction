Article continues below \nThe International Olympics Committee (IOC) has ordered Carter and Bolt, as well as teammates Asafa Powell and Michael Frater to return their medals last month after Carter’s sample was re-tested. \nBolt could be forgiven for being a little upset considering he's lost a medal and his special 'triple triple' tag, but he has refused to dwell on the situation. Article continues below Twitter goes crazy after Suarez's incredible solo goal for Barca vs Atleti \nHe has said : \"Initially I was disappointed, of course, but in life, things happen. I'm not sad... I'm just waiting to see what's going to happen but I gave up my medal.\" \nBolt has also commented on his reputation in athletics considering the loss of a gold medal, but he doesn’t believe his reputation will be tarnished despite having to hand back one of his medals. \nHe added: \"I think I've still accomplished a lot - it hasn't changed what I have done throughout my career, I have worked hard and pushed and done things that no-one has done before.\" \nCarter, 31, has confirmed he will be appealing the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but as it stands, Trinidad and Tobago have been awarded the gold medal for the event some eight years later. \nWe will now wait and see whether Bolt decides to enter the 2020 Olympics, just so he could have another shot at earning the 'triple triple' tag.
