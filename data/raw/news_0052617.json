(Vision courtesy: Seven News Melbourne) More videos Minister: Power surplus, but please don't use it. \nNSW Energy and Utilities Minister Don Harwin has requested the public to make restrictions to their power usage between peak times, in order to prevent potential rolling blackouts, despite claiming we have a power surplus. \nThe failures, coming about 6pm local time on the Friday, combined with a drop in solar and wind capacity – in line with forecasts – to overload NSW connections with Queensland and Victoria, \"creating an insecure operating state\". \nThe AEMO report is likely to stoke concerns about the stability of electricity supplies during crunch times even in a state such as NSW, which draws the vast bulk of its electricity from coal- and gas-fired power stations. Related Content Red hot: NSW smashes February statewide heat records two days in a row \nSouth Australia, which draws about 40 per cent of its electricity from wind energy, had power outages two days earlier in the same heatwave, when available gas supplies failed to be tapped and wind energy dropped more than predicted. \nDon Harwin, the new NSW Energy Minister, on Tuesday named Mary O'Kane, the state's chief scientist, as the chair of an energy security taskforce to examine how NSW can better prepare for extreme weather conditions. Advertisement \nNSW avoided a repeat of SA's power cuts - which took about 90,000 homes offline for about 40 minutes - in part because the state's biggest power user, Tomago Aluminium, could be asked to turn off its smelter potlines. \nTomago's demand dropped 290 MW as each of its three potlines were turned off in sequence. AEMO also intervened to order the third of the potlines to be turned off earlier than expected, meaning that for a period at the height of the power peak, some 580 MW of demand was shaved off.
