No one on the ground was hurt. \n“Five on the aircraft and looks like no one has survived the crash,” said Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Stephen Leane. \n“Looking at the fireball, it is incredibly lucky that no one was at the back of those stores or in the car park of the stores, that no one was even hurt,” Leane said of the conflagration and thick plume of smoke. \nThe US Embassy in Canberra confirmed that four victims were US citizens. \nTexans Greg Reynolds De Haven and Russell Munsch were identified by their families on social media as two of the victims. \nDe Haven’s sister Denelle Wicht posted on Facebook that her 70-year-old brother was among the victims. \n“Dear friends and family, my handsome athletic big brother was killed today in a plane accident while on his ‘once in a lifetime’ trip to Australia,” she wrote. \nMelbourne’s Herald Sun identified De Haven as a retired FBI agent . \nMunsch, a lawyer, was the founding partner of the Munsch Hardt Kopf & Harr firm in Austin, according to his LinkedIn page. \nThe Herald Sun named a third American as Glenn Garland. He retired in 2015 as the CEO of CLEAResult Consulting Inc. in Austin, a green energy firm, according to the Austin Business Journal. \nThe fourth American has not been identified. \nThe pilot was Max Quartermain, the 60-year-old Australian owner of the charter company Corporate and Leisure Travel. He made a mayday call and tried to return to the airport before crashing. \nThe plane had taken off from Melbourne’s second-biggest airport at Essendon for a golfing trip to King Island in Tasmania, about 160 miles to the south, officials said. \nA witness who gave his name as Jason told Australian Broadcasting Corp. that he was passing the mall in a taxi when the plane crashed. \n“I saw this plane coming in really low and fast. I couldn’t see the impact but when it hit, the building there was a massive fireball,” he said. \n“I could feel the heat through the window of the taxi, and then a wheel — it looked like a plane wheel — bounced on the road and hit the front of the taxi as we were driving along,” he said. \nVictoria Prime Minister Daniel Andrews described it as “the worst civil aviation accident that our state has seen for 30 years,” Agence France-Presse reported. \nPolice Superintendent Mick Frewen said investigations were focusing on a “catastrophic engine failure.” \nAnother witness told Sky News he saw “the fireball go up into the air,” adding that it “felt like a bomb had gone off.” \n“The fire was just so hot we could not get anywhere near it,” said the man, who gave his name as Ash, AFP reported. “We could see the wreckage, or what was left of it.” \nPlumber Michael Howard, 29, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. he saw a “blue flash.” \n“I was … just looking out the window … and then all of a sudden I just saw a blue flash come down and then all of a sudden there was a massive fireball,” Howard said. “It was like something from a movie.” \nWith Post wires ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:34:30.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
