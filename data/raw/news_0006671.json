Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. \n\nKalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order \"and its issues for our community\" and told the president he would not join the economic council. \n\nThe CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States . \n\n\"There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,\" he wrote in a note to employees. \"Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.\" \n\nThe White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump \"understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation's economy stronger.\" \n\nThe move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. \n\nOthers expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. \n\nMusk said he would attend the meeting. \"In tomorrow's meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy,\" he said in a tweet on Thursday. \n\nKalanick's departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. \n\n\"There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,\" said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. \"They (the Trump administration) clearly don't value the economic activity generated by tech.\" \n\nMicrosoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump's travel limits. \n\nTechnology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world . \n\nAmazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.
