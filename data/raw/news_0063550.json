Its net profit fell 32 per cent to $59 million and revenues were down 3.7 per cent at $458m. \nThe result was released under the shadow of a ruling from the Commerce Commission, which will announce on Thursday whether it will allow Sky TV to merge its business with Vodafone NZ. DAVID WHITE/FAIRFAX NZ \nSpark boss Simon Moutter says he has dropped Sky's broadcaster service fully this time. \nA commission spokesman said it would not release the reasoning for its pending decision until a later date. \nREAD MORE: \nSpark managing director Simon Moutter had a dig at Sky on the eve of the results, tweeting that he had ditched Sky's broadcast service, and this time that appears to be a clean cut. \nSpark launched a rival internet service, Lightbox, in 2014 and is opposing Sky's proposed merger with Vodafone. Cut the cord on my last Sky TV box, it's sitting on my desk while I think of what to do with it... watch this space! pic.twitter.com/iI19YkvrS8 — Simon Moutter (@simonmoutter) February 21, 2017 \nMoutter had tweeted in September that he had sent his Sky box back to Sky, not mentioning that he had kept one decoder, which he used to watch Sky Sports. Sending my box back to Sky TV. So much better value with Lightbox and other on demand streaming services nowadays. pic.twitter.com/TlYleHeTmD Ad Feedback \nMost Sky Sports programming can be viewed without a decoder through Sky's standalone FanPass online service. \nSpark and 2degrees are set to find out on Wednesday whether the High Court in Auckland will grant them a legal stay which would prevent Sky TV and Vodafone NZ enacting their merger until 36 hours after the commission releases the detailed reasoning for its decision – in the event it gave approval for the merger. \nThe companies say they might need the delay so they could seek a judicial review before the possible merger became a fait accompli. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:38:08.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
