He cited Tuesday's announcement by Humana to pull out of Obamacare's health exchanges as another sign that the current system is failing.\n\"It will keep getting worse unless we act,\" Ryan said.\nHe said the replacement bill would give consumers the power to choose their own health care plans in a more competitive marketplace. Ryan indicated that tax credits for consumers are likely to replace the government subsides currently provided to about 85% of Americans who purchase their health coverage from the Obamacare exchanges.\n\"A tax credit is a fixed amount (for consumers) to go buy the health plan of their choosing,\" Ryan said. \"What we're proposing is a patient-centered system where patients get to decide what to do.\"\nThe speaker said Republicans \"would love to have support from the other side,\" referring to Democrats. But he said it's clear Democrats don't want to support the GOP plan.\n\"They want to go down the socialized medicine path,\" Ryan said, referring to some Democrats' support for a \"public option\" that would create a government-run health insurance agency to compete with private companies. \"That is not something we're interested in doing.\"\nRyan acknowledged that Senate Republicans in more than a dozen states that expanded their Medicaid programs with federal help under Obamacare are worried about working-class families losing their coverage if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.\n\"We're going to have to find solutions that accommodate (those) concerns,\" he said.\nRepublicans made the repeal and replacement of Obamacare a major promise of their election campaigns last year. Although GOP leaders can pass legislation without Democratic support in the House, they will need help from Democrats to pass a replacement plan in the Senate.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:52:07.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
