Some people went back. Some people were held (detained) for long periods of time even after the order was issued. Lawyers had to meet with Border Patrol, US Marshals, US Attorneys, numerous times to get a clear answer as to whether the government felt the ruling applied nationwide and whether they would follow it.” \nIn San Francisco, the legal battle extends to fighting the threat to its status as a sanctuary city, an issue Trasvina is following closely. \n“It’s a well-crafted lawsuit,” Trasvina said. “ It does not suggest that SF can ignore US immigration policy, nor does it attempt to give SF its own independent policy. It simply states that the federal government cannot tell SF how to deploy its police department or public health workers in its own city and that the federal government is a bad partner.” \nBy that, Trasvina means the city is not equipped or funded to do the feds enforcement job. The real fear is the potential liability if cities get it wrong in enforcing the law. \n“If (the city) gets sued by people who should not be detained, the federal government is nowhere in sight to defend the lawsuit or pay the bills,” said Trasvina. \nHe added that San Francisco’s sanctuary suit simply aims to protect the city and put responsibility back on the feds. \nEmil Guillermo is a veteran journalist and commentator based in Northern California.
