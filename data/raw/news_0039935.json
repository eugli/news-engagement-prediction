He was released three months later by the Tis Hazari Court after the Delhi Police failed to file a chargesheet against him due to lack of evidence.\nLater, on the basis of his call details that allegedly proved he was in touch with LeT operatives, the Delhi Police chargesheeted him. Besides facing the charge in Sarojini Nagar Market blast in which 50 people were killed and over 200 injured, Dar is also a prime accused in Paharganj and Kalkaji blast which took place the same day.\nThe court had framed charges against Dar, and the other two for waging war against the state, conspiring, collecting arms, murder and attempt to murder.
