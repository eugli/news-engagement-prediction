You can understand if he’s a little emotional. In the middle of the field, there wasn’t anywhere Brady could go. Instead, he knelt down and took some time to process his emotions moments after completing a 25-point comeback that ended with 31 unanswered points. Bill Belichick joined the kneeling party, along with LeGarrette Blount, on the field. Belichick and Brady have been along for the entire ride. Of course this is a poignant moment for the duo. You can see how important it is for them. Gisele Bundchen, Brady’s wife, was absolutely thrilled with the win, too. Can you tell? Congratulations to Bundchen, Brady and the Patriots . They are a dynasty in every sense of the word.
