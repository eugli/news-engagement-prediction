First he was disinvited from CPAC , the Conservative Political Action Committee. Then he lost his lucrative book deal with Simon & Schuster. \nNow, despite still having many conservative defenders, he has now resigned as senior editor at Breitbart, saying, \n“Breitbart News has stood by me when others caved…I would be wrong to allow my poor choice of words to detract from my colleagues’ important reporting, so today I am resigning from Breitbart, effective immediately. This decision is mine alone.” \nas MSNBC’s Kyle Griffin tweeted the news: Milo resigns from Breitbart. pic.twitter.com/gtSfTRIi1l \n— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) February 21, 2017 \nAs is typical with Yiannopoulos, the whole affair quickly took on something on the surreal. CNN’s Tom Kludt reports that at a press conference Yiannopoulos held yesterday in New York City: \nMilo shifted seamlessly from contrition to defiance to outright self-aggrandizement. For about a half-hour, he spoke and took questions from reporters ranging from NBC to the Gateway Pundit to, well, me. I asked if Alex Marlow, Breitbart’s EIC, had asked for his resignation; he declined to answer, saying he preferred to keep those conversations private. At times during the hastily organized presser, he seemed genuinely bothered that his remarks gave many the impression that he had endorsed pedophilia. But invariably, Milo remained Milo. “I don’t think this has done any harm for my profile,” he said of the controversy that cost him a prominent speaking engagement, a book and his job in the span of 24 hours. \nAdam Rothberg, a spokesman for Simon & Schuster, said via Twitter “After careful consideration @simonschuster and its @threshold_books have cancelled publication of Dangerous by Milo Yiannopoulos.” \nDon’t cheer Simon & Schuster, though. Apparently, their careful consideration didn’t enter into their decision when Yiannopoulos was saying campus rapes weren’t real. And keep in mind Threshold also publishes Donald Trump, Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh. \nThere are no heroes at Simon & Schuster. If they had a problem with Milo Yiannopoulos it should have surfaced long before now. For his part, Yiannopoulos is certain somebody else will publish his book. He is probably right. \nThe self-styled provocateur provoked too much, revealing in the process the hypocrisy of conservatives who will tolerate attacks on the transgenders, Muslims, women, and Jews but not pedophilia. Unless that pedophilia is heterosexual in nature. \nWe well remember Duck Dynasty’s Phil Robertson fantasizing about marrying 15-year-old girls without consequence. \nYiannopoulos celebrated his trollish behavior, attacking others with wild abandon and other than a brief banning from Twitter for his attacks on SNL and Ghostbusters’ Leslie Jones, had escaped without consequences. \nAccording to Fox News , “Yiannopoulos said he will focus his work on entertainment and education rather than journalism,” which should be easy for him since harassing and trolling people online isn’t really journalism.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:38:27.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
