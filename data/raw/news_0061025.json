At one point the line stretched well around the corner of the building. \nBefore the opening, the first 50 people in line received sunglasses, wrist bands and a Shake Shack T-shirt designed by John Varvatos, a Detroit native and menswear designer with a menswear store on Woodward. \nThe first customers in line were four Grosse Pointe North students on mid-winter break.The four -- Maddie Macconnachie, Stephanie Roy, Adam Schade and Madison Delas -- all 17, said they’d been in line since 9 a.m. Buy Photo \nA huge lunch crowd gathers as Shake Shack celebrates its Grand Opening in downtown Detroit, Thursday, Feb. 23, 2017.

A vegetarian, Macconachie’s planned on ordering the ‘Shroom burger, a crisp-fried Portobello mushrooms filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato and shack sauce. \nIt’s the shack sauce that is Macconachie’s favorite. \nMatt Meyer, area director for the Midwest region, said today’s opening was “especially exciting being in the “D”. \n“It’s the energy and excitement of having us be a part of the rebirth here,” Meyer said. “We are fortunate and happy ... this never gets old,” Meyer said. \nZach Koff, Shake Shack chief operating officer, echoed Meyer’s sentiment. “This building is an amazing building,” Koff said. “This area is where Detroit comes together. We are happy to be part of the resurgence. “ 47 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:48:45.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
