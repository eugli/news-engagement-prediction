Bruce Rauner has introduced a full state budget plan. Feb. 16, 2017 (John Byrne / Chicago Tribune) John Byrne and Monique Garcia mocked Gov. Bruce Rauner in a lengthy rant Thursday, saying he would donate $1,000 to charity if a reporter could provide evidence the governor has presented a full state budget plan while in office.\n\"I've asked the Police Department to get the hound dogs out to go find it. I'm giving you a thousand dollars to the charity of your choice. Find me the governor's budget,\" Emanuel said after a reporter asked him to comment on Rauner's spending plan. \"Produce it, line by line, like every chief executive has to do.\" \n\"I'll stand here, with bathroom breaks, until you produce it,\" Emanuel said during a five-minute dissection of what he said were Rauner's shortcomings as a chief executive. \"No. Because you're asking me to comment on something that doesn't exist.\" \nA day after Rauner had to stop for two minutes after a teleprompter glitch during his annual budget speech, the mayor also offered an alternate theory on the pause. Bruce Rauner for the first time laid out his terms for potential tax hikes to dig the state out of a historic morass even as Democrats openly mocked his leadership.\nBefore the governor had entered... \nIllinois' broke and broken down state government was on full display Wednesday as Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner for the first time laid out his terms for potential tax hikes to dig the state out of a historic morass even as Democrats openly mocked his leadership. \nBefore the governor had entered... (Monique Garcia, Kim Geiger and Haley BeMiller) \n\"The teleprompter didn't have a problem. It got to the budget section and it wasn't there,\" Emanuel said after talking to new recruits at the Chicago Police Academy. \"There is no budget. Line by line, he hasn't produced one in three years. Three budget presentations. It does not exist.\" \nA Rauner spokeswoman could not be immediately reached for comment. \nWhile Thursday's takedown was Emanuel's most baroque recent commentary on the governor's state government stewardship, it followed his theme this week of hammering his onetime vacation friend in the run-up to and aftermath of Rauner's budget speech. \nJust before Rauner spoke Wednesday, Emanuel appeared at a Northwest Side child care center to blast him for not getting a state budget passed while such facilities suffer, saying \"it's not like the third's going to be the charm here, OK?\" \nOn Tuesday, the mayor's school board sued Rauner, accusing him and the Illinois State Board of Education of violating the Illinois Civil Rights Act for maintaining what the school system termed \"separate and unequal\" systems for funding school districts and pension obligations. \nThe mayor also told a group of business leaders Tuesday that Rauner's failure to deliver a balanced budget was \"the biggest adverse effect\" on the city's economy.

(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) \nMeanwhile, at the Capitol, Senate Democrats spent hours dismantling Rauner's budget proposal, hammering administration officials about the exact size of the plan's multi-billion dollar deficit. \nBy the end of the contentious hearing, Rauner budget director Scott Harry acknowledged the spending plan is $7.2 billion out of whack without various savings and revenues built into the proposal that rely on changes in law which are far from fruition. The Chicago Tribune reported that figure Wednesday evening. \nKey to Rauner's plan is the expectation that the Senate can pass a controversial package to raise taxes, a proposal Rauner has said he could embrace if lawmakers first make some major tweaks. Without that, Rauner wants legislators to give him the power to make unilateral cuts, an idea he pushed last year that went nowhere. \n\"He makes a lot of assumptions, the governor,\" said Sen. Michael Hastings, D-Tinley Park. \nRepublicans also questioned Rauner's math, with Sen. Kyle McCarter of Lebanon saying \"the unbalanced nature of this budget is obvious to all of us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:48:53.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
