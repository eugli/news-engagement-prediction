because the future of Europe is at stake, as is the future of Franco-British relations, which have a structuring effect on so many issues, over and above economic and financial matters - issues of defence, homeland security and immigration.\"\nAsked why he has visited London three times in six months, Mr Macron said: \"This is the sixth city in France, as Boris Johnson put it so well.\"\nEmmanuel Macron, candidate in France's 2017 French presidential arrives at 10 Downing Street Credit: STEFAN WERMUTH/REUTERS H e said it was important to \"convince a young and enterprising electorate\" about what he wants to \"do for the country and Europe\".\n\"I will give my vision of Franco-British relations, my strategy for Europe, and I what I want to do in France,\" he told journalists.\nThis is the first time a British Prime Minister has met a French presidential candidate since Tony Blair received Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007. \nMr Macron was due to go onto to meet Philip Hammond, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\nWith rivals claiming he doesn't have the experience (he has never held elected office) or the mettle to deal with the likes of Vladimir Putin or Donald Trump, his unexpected meeting with Mrs May - announced via Twitter by his team on Monday afternoon - will help bolster his statesman credentials.\nHowever, he cannot afford to appear too gushing towards the Prime Minister, whose party many in France accuse of having placed a spanner in the works of the European Union and bolstered Ms Le Pen's argument that France should stage a \"Frexit\" referendum of its own.\nHow the French presidential election works M rs May would normally be politically closer to Mr Fillon, who wants to enact a radical overhaul of the public sector and has previously expressed deep admiration for Margaret Thatcher, but he has made no indication he intends to visit the UK.\nOn Monday, Mr Fillon unveiled watered-down public healthcare reforms after earlier plans to part-privatise the system saw him nosedive in the polls.\nThe meeting comes at a crucial moment in Mr Macron's presidential run ; whose promise to enact a \"democratic revolution\" on a \"neither Left nor Right\" ticket has hit turbulence in recent days.\nAfter a spell out in front, one poll now sees Mr Macron neck and neck in the election's knock-out first round with the embattled conservative candidate François Fillon, who has been embroiled in fake jobs allegations involving his British wife. \nPolls suggest that whichever candidate makes it to round two of the election on May 7 will go onto beat Marine Le Pen, the far-Right Front National leader , who is widely tipped to reach the run-off only to lose. However, the gap between the FN leader and either rival has also narrowed - rattling markets.\nProfile | Emmanuel Macron M eanwhile, Mr Macron's support base is by far the most volatile, the same polls suggest, meaning a major faux pas could see him drop behind.\nAlthough critics accuse Mr Macron of sitting on the fence by remaining woefully short on policy details, he can expect a warm welcome from around 4,500 people, many working in the financial sector, registered to attend the London event organised by his youthful grassroots campaign En Marche! (On the Move!).\nWhile other candidates have blasted globalisation and big business, Mr Macron embraces the \"liberal\" market economy and a start-up mindset He has pledged to help \"outsiders\" locked out of France's generous system rather than the minority of \"insiders\" who reap its cosy benefits and block any change.\nAround a third of the 300,000 globally minded French nationals living in London have registered to vote in the upcoming election as part of the Northern Europe constituency, meaning that their support could prove significant given the unpredictable outcome.\nFrench presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron speaks to the media outside 10 Downing Street on Tuesday Credit: Stefan Rousseau/PA M r Macron is staunchly pro-European and recently warned he would advocate a \"pretty tough\" line in Brexit negotiations with Britain.\nFrench expatriates due at the event at Central Westminster Hall on Monday night may seen him as the antidote to the soak-the-rich policies of his former boss, Mr Hollande, whose 75 per cent tax on millionaires Mr Macron himself derided as turning France into \"Cuba without the sun\". The measure drove many to move o the UK.\nThis week, Mr Macron is finally due to start revealing hard policies, starting with his budgetary plans on Friday. He has already said he wants to cut state spending by €60 billion over five years. He will then outline around ten main manifesto \"themes\" as part of a \"contract with the nation\" on March 2.\nMr Fillon was forced to show much of his hand far earlier in party primaries, promising to cut more than half a million jobs from the state sector and force civil servants to work longer hours for the same pay.\nMs Le Pen, meanwhile, this month outlined 144 proposals to the French electorate, which include leaving the eurozone, slowing immigration and calling a referendum on leaving the European Union.\nProfile | Marine Le Pen M r Macron has raised several million euros in campaign funds from dinners and invitation-only meetings with expatriates in London and other capitals at which guests are invited to contribute as much as €7,500 (£6,400) to support his candidacy.\nHis team said he was due to meet high-level contacts in London in the search for fresh donations.\nAnother key event for Mr Macron this week is whether François Bayrou, a high-profile centrist who came third in the 2007 presidential election, decides to run or throw his weight behind his younger, more urbane alter-ego.\nFrench media suggest Mr Bayrou has been horse-trading for the conditions of his support but has not ruled out running for president for a fourth time.\nHis candidacy could deprive Mr Macron of vital votes in the centre ground.\nMr Bayrou is due to make an announcement on Wednesday afternoon in Paris.\nProfile | François Fillon", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:06:18.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
