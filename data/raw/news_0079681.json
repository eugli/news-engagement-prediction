Samantha has since gone on to become one of the topmost heroines in Tamil and Telugu having starred opposite the bigwigs, Vijay, Mahesh Babu, Suriya, Junior NTR, Vikram, Pawan Kalyan and many others. She has written this emotional letter to all those who have been part of her eventful journey so far. \"It's been 7 years and I am in a talking mood. So like any rags to riches story, I have had my fair share of hardships, insecurities, failure, rejection, pain, sadness, success, fame and wealth. But that does not mean I became happier as I became more successful. Oh, happiness isn't so simple.It took me only 7 years (pun intended) to understand how to crack the art of normalcy.. understand that 'if I don't shoot every single day of the year I am not a failure,' that people who abuse me on social media spend less time thinking about me than I about them,\"that I will not have a heart attack and die over time there is a problem,''that there always is a next time,' and most importantly, `your story is a success only when you make other people a part of it.' I guess what I am trying to say is... what I have learned in this time is that all the fame, all the wealth, and all the success does not necessarily mean all the happiness. The greatest blessing cinema has offered me has been the people it has introduced into my life. People who have influenced my entire being. And it gave me your love, love that I hung onto dearly and desperately in hard times... and fondly and gratefully on sunny days. Thank you so very much. Will keep loving you all back all my life. \" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:40:19.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
