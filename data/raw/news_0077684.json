The actress, who is nominated for a record-breaking 20th Academy Award this year, has responded to false claims made by the designer (and originally published by WWD) that she commissioned a couture gown from the designer only to cancel when another house offered her money to wear its dress to the Oscars instead. According to WWD , both Lagerfeld and Chanel have since admitted that the claim was false.\n In a statement to WWD, Streep said:\nIn reference to Mr. Lagerfeld's \"statement,\" there is no \"controversy\": Karl Lagerfeld, a prominent designer, defamed me, my stylist and the illustrious designer whose dress I chose to wear, in an important industry publication. That publication printed this defamation, unchecked. Subsequently, the story was picked up globally, and continues, globally, to overwhelm my appearance at the Oscars, on the occasion of my record-breaking 20th nomination, and to eclipse this honor in the eyes of the media, my colleagues and the audience. I do not take this lightly, and Mr. Lagerfeld's generic \"statement\" of regret for this \"controversy\" was not an apology. He lied, they printed the lie, and I am still waiting.", "external_links": ["http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/streep-fires-back-at-lagerfeld-wwd-10820959/"], "published": "2017-02-27T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:19:41.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
