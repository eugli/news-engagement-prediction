Israel is expected to gain over a billion NIS from its taxation, according to recent research,” Kisch added.The government statement announcing the vote said it could take months for the legislation to make its way through parliament.In the United States, 28 states have legalized cannabis for medical use and since 2012, Colorado, Alaska, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington have approved marijuana for recreational use. The market there, by some estimates, will reach $50 billion over the next decade.Israel is widely regarded as one of the world leaders in medical cannabis research, even though the local market is small.
