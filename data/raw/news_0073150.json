The last several days have been eventful for Apple AAPL . The company was the subject of countless rumors surrounding its upcoming plans in the tablet and smartphone markets, and found itself once again at the center of a debate with the White House over equal rights. This is Fortune’s weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news this week. To see last week’s roundup, click here. Along the way, the company was the focal point for a discussion on EU taxes, and also announced details on its new campus, Apple Park. There was even some talk of an exploding iPhone. Read on to learn more about the week that was in the Apple universe, and all the biggest news surrounding the Cupertino, Calif.-based giant. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Apple is planning a big iPad event in March, according to Japanese Apple-tracking site Mac Otakara. The company could unveil four new iPads at the event, including updates to its 9.7- and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models. The other two models could feature screen sizes measuring 7.9 inches and 10.5 inches, the report says. Apple’s new iPads will likely come with improved designs, better processors, and better battery life. Another week, another iPhone rumor. This time around, Reuters is reporting that Apple could offer several improvements in an iPhone released later this year, including higher-resolution screens, wireless charging, and 3D sensors. The news comes after a slew of rumors have surfaced in recent weeks saying Apple is planning a major iPhone update this year that could offer a curved screen, all-glass design, and more. Apple this week was said to have acquired the iCloud.net domain name. An Asian social network was living on the site but will be taken down. Apple apparently acquired the site domain so there would be no confusion for users who want to access its cloud-based synching service iCloud and instead find themselves on an unknown social network. Apple’s ongoing fight with the European Union over allegations the company illegally benefited from state aid to the tune of $13.7 billion took a turn this week. In a filing in the EU, Apple argued that its “fundamental rights” had been violated by the EU’s competition watchdog, the European Commission. It added that the investigators failed to conduct “a diligent and impartial investigation.” Apple will carry that argument to court when the company and the EU face off this summer. It’s official: Apple Campus 2 officially has a final name. Apple Park will open to Apple employees in April, the company announced this week. The sprawling campus spans 175 acres and will have more than 9,000 trees when complete. It also features the 2.8-million-square-foot Apple ring where the company’s employees will be housed, and offers a state-of-the-art 100,000-square-foot fitness facility. The on-site auditorium will be named Steve Jobs Theater in remembrance of the company’s iconic co-founder. And yes, Tim Cook is moving in to Apple Park in April with the rest of his staff. Apple spoke out against President Donald Trump’s decision this week to end federal protections for transgender students using bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity. In a statement, the company said that it “believes everyone deserves a chance to thrive in an environment free from stigma and discrimination.” Apple added that it takes issue “with any effort to limit or rescind their rights and protections.” Apple is preparing to build a new $50 million data center project, Fortune learned this week. It’s believed that the complex, known as Project Isabel, is a response to growing demand for the company’s iCloud services, including photo, document, and file storage. Apple hasn’t yet commented on the possible construction of its new facility. In other Apple building news, Apple is reportedly planning to expand its footprint and workforce in Seattle. The company will reportedly rent more floors at Seattle’s Two Union Square, a 56-story skyscraper in downtown where it already leases two floors. The employees will apparently work on artificial intelligence and machine learning. In the same week Apple said that software update iOS 10.2.1 could address many iPhone 6 battery troubles, the company is reportedly investigating a video that surfaced online showing an iPhone 7 Plus burning up. Apple has yet to comment on the iPhone 7 Plus problem and whether the reported explosion was user error or caused by a defect within the device. For more about Tim Cook, watch: One more thing…To commemorate the late Steve Jobs’ 62nd birthday on Friday, Cook shared some famous Quote: s from his former boss.
