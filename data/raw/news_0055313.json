Formerly known as the Fox Writers Intensive, the program was launched in 2011 to train experienced writers who have diverse voices, backgrounds and life experiences and build a field of talent for potential staffing on Fox television, feature film and digital entertainment productions. \nThis year's finalists, and their respective representatives are: Erick Castrillon and Esteban Arango (Valor Entertainment), Arielle Diaz (CAA), Tania Lotia (CAA & Laurelmont Management Group, Jennifer Graham Imada (Independent), Brad Marques (Laurelmont Management Group), Elizabeth Oyebode (Independent), Keely MacDonald (Grandview), Nicky Young (Independent), Lauren Tyler (Art/Work Entertainment), Mellori Velasquez (Independent) and Yasemin Yilmaz (Independent). \nThe participants will spend 14 weeks brushing up their craft and establishing connections with a wide range of Fox staff writers, showrunners, creative executives, screenwriters and directors. Selected writers will have the chance to receive specific feedback on their scripts through interactive \"master classes\" and will participate in intimate guest speaker sessions with showrunners, writers, executives and directors to discuss case studies of their film and television shows. \n\"Fox Writers Lab is a great tool to open the door and create meaningful opportunities for these future writers, producers and creators,\" says Fox comedy head Suzanna Makkos. \nAdds network drama chief Terence Carter: “Having been closely involved with Fox Writers Lab, it has been wonderful to see the impact its participants have made on a number of our dramas. While learning from the best auspices in the business, they bring new and fresh ideas to the writing room and bolster a creative process that thrives on diverse perspectives.” \nThe winning fellow will be awarded a purchase and development deal on their original script or a first-look deal with Fox network or any of its affiliated entities. They'll also get one-on-one creative meetings with network and other business heads, as well as priority staffing efforts across Fox properties.. All of this year's participants will receive staffing meetings for current Fox series and a first-look agreement to option their original and new scripts. \nParticipants from previous years have gone onto write for Fox shows including Lucifer and Star .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:59:57.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
