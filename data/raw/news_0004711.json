She took charge of the post on December 31, pledging to take forward the legacy of Jayalalithaa. \n\nIn December last year, four state ministers had asked Sasikala to become the Chief Minister, besides AIADMK General Secretary. \n\nA resolution to this effect was passed at a meeting of Tirunelveli Urban Jaya Peravai (Forum), led by state AIADMK secretary and revenue minister R B Udhayakumar on December 17. \n\nThe other ministers who participated in the meeting were V M Rajalakshmi, Sevoor Ramachandran and Kadambur Raju. \n\nSasikala, 62, had been a close aide of Jayalalithaa for three decades and was always seen as a power centre in AIADMK.
