Read More Should Leicester City sack boss Claudio Ranieri? Hear former Foxes star Robbie Savage hit out at haters Leicester's Demarai Gray and Shinji Okazaki show their disappointment after their loss to Swansea (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nPaul Bates (#MUFC) @Paul_Bates_: Think Leicester City need to get #GaryLineker out of retirement. In fact even @RobbieSavage8 would be an improvement \nSAV SAYS: “Steady on, Paul – Gary Lineker is a Leicester legend, and I won the League Cup with them in my playing career, but our time has come and gone. We've both got jobs in the media now. It's awfully kind of you to suggest that I might be able to help them out when the chips are down, but I'm 42 now, you know...” \nLee Marlow @LM_Marlow: Dear @RobbieSavage8, You are not one of us, You ceased to be one of us when you kissed the badge of our rivals, stop pretending you are. Gary Lineker is a Foxes legend, but it's a bit late for him to save their season (Photo: Getty) \nSAV SAYS: “You're boring me, Lee. If you don't know how much I loved playing for Leicester, and how much I admired Martin O'Neill as a manager, you don't know me at all.” \nRichard Booker @booko67: @RobbieSavage8 has to be the least liked ex-LCFC player. I can't actually think of another ex-player I don't like. \nSAV SAYS: “That's fine, Richard. You're entitled to your opinion every bit as much as I'm entitled to mine. You may not like me now, but there must have been a few Leicester fans who did – or they wouldn't have voted me player of the season, would they?” Some Leicester fans might not love Savage, but plenty do (Photo: Birmingham Post and Mail) \nDaithi O'Laohgaire @Cunionsandphey: Champions to a relegation dogfight. @RobbieSavage8 nails it on what's gone awry. \nSAV SAYS: “Unfortunately, nothing about Leicester's performance in the 2-0 defeat at Swansea suggested anything has changed. That display at the Liberty didn't tick the boxes I was talking about in terms of energy, passion, spirit and attitude. It was just more of the same. I still believe they might – just might – have enough experience and quality to hang on in the Premier League, but it's going to be desperately tight.” (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nM Curtis @markleecurtis: Players gotta play, Kante is good but one player, Vardy can't score without the ball \nSAV SAYS: “I agree – it's time for the players to stand up and be counted. As I observed in my column last week, N'Golo Kante has been a huge miss as the minesweeper who protects the back four. He was so good last season that he made Robert Huth and Wes Morgan look like Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini at times, and he also gave Danny Drinkwater a platform to shine in midfield. I do have some sympathy with Jamie Vardy – his body language has not always been great, but in terms of service, he has been feeding on scraps. It's absolutely incredible that, seven weeks into 2017, Leicester still have not scored in the Premier League this calendar year.” Ranieri and captain Wes Morgan pose on behalf of Leicester with their Laureus Spirit of Sport Award (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nDavid Cann @drwhofan_194: There's no patience in football any more – not even for a man who performed a miracle. Unbelievable. \nSAV SAYS: “No arguments from me. They should erect a statue of Claudio Ranieri in the centre of Leicester, to stand alongside King Richard III, in recognition of what he's done for the city. I could not believe it when a fellow pundit on Radio 5 Live, Chris Sutton, suggested that Ranieri would lose his job if Leicester had finished 12th last season and they had gone on the same run of results now. But that's the whole point – they didn't finish 12th last year, they won the title! He gave Leicester City the most magical moment in their history. It was the most extraordinary football story ever told. And if you go back over the last nine years, out of 92 places in the top four divisions, in order they have finished 42nd, 45th, 25th, 30th, 29th, 23rd, 21st, 14th and 1st. Where is the precedent that says they are fighting to become champions of England every year? In my opinion, if Leicester go down, Ranieri should be given the chance to bring them back up.” Sav says Leicester should put a statue of Ranieri next to King Richard III (Photo: Getty Images) \nSteven Terrett @StevenTerrett: #motd Leicester v Derby. Is that Donald J Trump or Robbie Savage? \nSAV SAYS: “Haha - like me, Mr Trump has also risen to a position of considerable prominence!” \nAnd finally... \nOllie Wedgbury @ollie_wedgbury: Why the **** is Dion Dublin presenting Homes Under the Hammer?
