Credit: Natalia Spencer The mother of a five-year-old girl who died while suffering what seemed like a simple cold is coming to the end of a charity walk around Britain's coastline in her daughter's memory.\nNatalia Spencer from Cheltenham began the challenge last February to raise money for the Grand Appeal to buy new equipment for Bristol Children's Hospital where her daughter Elizabeth was treated.\nElizabeth died after her organs failed in December 2015. So far her mother's efforts on the 6000-mile walk have raised more than Â£100,000.\nNatalia is expected to finish the journey this afternoon back where it started at Durdle Door beach - the last beach she visited with Elizabeth.\nElizabeth Spencer died of what seemed to be a common cold. Credit: Natalia Spencer When Elizabeth first fell ill it appeared she only had a common cold but within 24 hours she was rushed to hospital and died.\nNatalia decided to call her fundraising effort ' Elizabeth's Footprint' and has used the symbol of a rainbow to reflect the dazzling personality of her little girl.\nDuring the sponsored walk Natalia has taken on part of the challenge with other bereaved mothers including Heidi Loughlin and has since been nominated for a Pride of Britain award .\nShe's expected to complete the challenge this afternoon.\nNatalia has called her fundraising effort 'Elizabeth's Footprint' in memory of her.
