Cravalho, who voiced Moana 's titular Polynesian princess, has boarded Jason Katims's NBC pilot Drama High , EW reports . \nFrom the brilliant mind that gave us Friday Night Lights and Parenthood , Drama High will go inside the high school drama department in a blue-collar town. It's based on a book of the same name from Michael Sokolove, which follows the incredible true story of how a drama teacher and his young thespians completely revitalized a struggling town. Per Deadline , Cravalho will play a student named Lilette who has \"big dreams, and joining the drama department is one of them.\" \nKatims will write and executive-produce the project with Hamilton producer duo Flody Suarez and Jeffrey Seller. Cravalho is no stranger to Hamilton ; the Hawaiian teen previously worked with Hamilton creator Lin-Manual Miranda on the Oscar-nominated song \"How Far I'll Go\" for Moana . \nThe song increasingly seems incredibly fitting for Cravalho, a girl from the small town of Kohala, Hawaii. The effervescent and exuberant teen has a long Hollywood career ahead of her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T19:18:26.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
