They cited unnamed intelligence and law enforcement sources. \nAt his press conference with Netanyahu, Trump was not asked directly about the report (he took questions from Town Hall and Christian Broadcasting Network), but he tweeted early on Tuesday that “the real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy. Very un-American!” \nTrump said that he was open to a one- or two-state solution when it comes to peace between Israel and the Palestinians, while Netanyahu talked of seeking a regional solution.

Netanyahu responded that the issue was “not at the core” of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. \nNetanyahu also signaled a much warmer relationship with Trump than with his predecessor. \n“There is no greater supporter of the Jewish state than President Donald Trump ,” he said. \nTrump also was asked about anti-semitic incidents in the United States since the campaign. \nAfter talking about his electoral college victory, Trump said, “We are going to do everything in our power to stop long simmering racism and every other thing that is going on.” Filed Under:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T20:12:55.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
