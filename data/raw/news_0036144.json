External Link: Should Shaun Marsh be picked for the first Test? \nThe 33-year-old is yet to speak with coach Darren Lehmann or chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns regarding their plans for the first Test, which starts in Pune on Thursday. \nBut he has every reason to feel bullish about the prospect of playing his first Test since breaking a finger at the WACA three months ago. \n\"As individuals and a team it always gives you a bit of confidence when you have a good day in the warm-up game,\" Marsh said. \n\"It (batting with Smith) certainly does calm your nerves, he's a fantastic player. \n\"It was nice to spend some time out in the middle ... it was a pretty good wicket.\" Photo: Steve Smith got among the runs as well with a quick century. (AP: Rajanish Kakade) \nAustralia was 5-327 at stumps, recovering well after the early loss of openers David Warner and Matt Renshaw. \nSmith and Marsh, the only two Australians to score hundreds during a miserable 3-0 series loss last year in Sri Lanka, both enhanced their subcontinent reputations in a 156-run stand. \n\"It (the subcontinent) is a place I've always enjoyed coming to ... I feel comfortable,\" Marsh said. \nThe green-tinged pitch represents the antithesis of what the visitors expect to encounter in the four-Test series opener. \nLikewise, the bowlers were not nearly as threatening as India's spin aces Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja - the best and second-best Test bowlers in the world according to the ICC's rankings. \nIt had been unclear if and how selectors would fit the veteran into the XI for the first Test. \nThe answer seemingly came when Khawaja was the one specialist batsman in Australia's 16-man touring party left to run drinks in the tourists' only tune-up before the first Test. \nKhawaja was dumped after two Tests in Sri Lanka last year, while Marsh scored 130 in Colombo on the same tour. It appears selectors still harbour concerns about Khawaja's ability to play spin bowling - especially in Asia, where the left-hander averages 19.16 from four Tests. \nAAP ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:36:40.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
