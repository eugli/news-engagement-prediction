It is a fact that the elites in every country are making money. There are rich people everywhere, and yet they do not contribute to the growth of their own countries.\" More » Government Spending \nClinton has raised concerns about the federal deficit and growing national debt during her tenure in President Barack Obama's administration. \nKey quote on the national debt: \"It poses a national security threat in two ways: it undermines our capacity to act in our own interest, and it does constrain us where constraint may be undesirable.\" \nClinton did not blame Obama, however. Instead, she accused his predecessor, Republican President George W. Bush, of running up the debt by launching two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan , in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks at the same time he successfully pushed through tax cuts that benefited the wealthiest Americans. \nKey quote on Bush\" \"It is fair to say that we fought two wars without paying for them and we had tax cuts that were not paid for either, and that has been a very deadly combination to fiscal sanity and responsibility.\" Gun Control \nClinton has said she supports the right to bear arms as spelled out in the Constitution's Second Amendment. But she has called for limits on who is able to obtain firearms. For example, Clinton has supported tougher laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally unstable. Immigration Reform \nClinton has said she supports \"comprehensive\" immigration reform measures that include tougher security along the nation's borders and issuing stiffer penalties on employers who hire immigrants who are in the United States illegally. In 2007, Clinton said she supported the idea of fining immigrants living in American illegally, making them pay back taxes, learn English and then \"stand in line to be eligible for legal status in this country.\" \nAs a U.S. senator, Clinton supported a 2007 measure that would have granted immigrants living in the United States illegally a path to citizenship and established a new guest worker program. As First Lady, Clinton supported the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which expanded the use of deportation and made it tough to appeal. More » Wal-Mart \nWal-Mart's controversial employment practices have come under fire over the years. Clinton was asked whether she thought the giant retailer was good or bad for America. \nKey quote on Wal-Mart: \"Well, it's a mixed blessing ... because when Wal-Mart started, it brought goods into rural areas, like rural Arkansas, where I was happy to live for 18 years, and gave people a chance to stretch their dollar further. As they grew much bigger, though, they have raised serious questions about the responsibility of corporations and how they need to be a leader when it comes to providing health care and having, you know, safe working conditions and not discriminating on the basis of sex or race or any other category.\" Abortion \nClinton supports a woman's right to have an abortion but has said she is personally opposed to the procedure and that it is a \"sad, even tragic choice to many, many women.\" Clinton has repeatedly spoke out against government interfering with the reproductive rights and decisions of women and families, and has she supports the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade . \nKey quote on abortion: \"There is no reason why government cannot do more to educate and inform and provide assistance so that the choice guaranteed under our constitution either does not ever have to be exercised or only in very rare circumstances.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:06:23.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
