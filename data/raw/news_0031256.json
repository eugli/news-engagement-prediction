It is that serious thought is being given to dropping his £42.5 million record signing from a match that will go a long way to determining both their futures. \nUpset Bayern and the narrative surrounding Wenger’s future again shifts. \nYou have to go back to 2008 and AC Milan since Arsenal eliminated a team of Bayern’s stature in the Champions League. Lose, and the season will end at the very best with the same top-four finish and FA Cup run that might currently delight any rival other than Chelsea but which has done so little to appease restless Arsenal fans. \n“It’s important that we protect the second game,” said Wenger, clearly conscious of the pattern of six straight exits at the last-16 stage. “We must go there, not hide, but defend well as a team.” \nThe question, then, is whether that wish is really compatible with leaving Özil in his usual free role in front of a two-man midfield? Özil represents the luxury oil rather than the engine of any team. He often becomes anonymous if the rest of the team are stuck in neutral – as they often were even in beating Hull City by a flattering 2-0 margin on Saturday – and so there is a persuasive argument against Bayern for a third central midfielder.

He did things that he is not used to doing. He needs to find confidence again. He misses chances that don’t look unfeasible.” \nWenger was reassured after speaking with Özil on Friday but the decision against Bayern is further complicated by the availability and superior form of Olivier Giroud, Lucas Perez and Danny Welbeck. All three were on the bench again on Saturday and must surely be starting to question how Özil is getting more game-time . \nT here will no such feelings toward Alexis Sánchez, whose work rate, as much as quality, was decisive in a win that temporarily eases rather than ends the tension that surrounds Arsenal. \nWenger had made an appeal in his programme notes for support from the fans and, while conscious of their anxiety right up until Sánchez’s penalty in added time, he felt that they did “unite” and “show that they care”. Yet with his future still so uncertain – and just two points separating positions second to sixth in the Premier League table – Wenger will know that the relief he felt can be only fleeting. \n“Experience helps to anticipate the problems that you face when it doesn’t work,” he said. “You know that if you do not win the confidence drops even more. That is not what is needed to go into a game like Bayern in the Champions League. I know we have not been brilliant but we had to win.” Arsene Wenger's Arsenal face Bayern Munich on Wednesday \nT here was also some needed perspective when asked whether he was enjoying his job amid such scrutiny. “Yes,” said Wenger. “You have to enjoy football. It’s true that it’s not always easy but it is important that you feel happy. What we want is to do well and qualify against Bayern Munich. It’s a good opportunity.” \nSuch optimism was natural given the result, even if Hull City deserved to take most heart from the respective performances. They actually had the majority of the possession, plenty of chances and felt aggrieved with two key decisions by referee Mark Clattenburg. Most contentious was the decision to allow Sánchez’s first goal after it cannoned in off his arm. “The referee has told us he missed it and has apologised,” said defender Harry Maguire. “He spoke to his linesman and he said he didn’t get a good view on it and if he gave anything he would be guessing. Everyone makes mistakes so we don’t point any fingers at Mark at all.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:03:23.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
