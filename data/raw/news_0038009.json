Share via Twitter Gilbert Carrasquillo / Getty Images Actress Scarlett Johansson has some ~thoughts~ about monogamy—aka the practice of having a relationship with one person at a time. In a new interview with Playboy magazine, The Avengers star talked candidly about love and marriage. When the mag asked Johansson about monogamy, she revealed she doesn't think it's natural: \"I think the idea of marriage is very romantic; it’s a beautiful idea, and the practice of it can be a very beautiful thing. I don’t think it’s natural to be a monogamous person. I might be skewered for that, but I think it’s work. It’s a lot of work. And the fact that it is such work for so many people—for everyone—the fact of that proves that it is not a natural thing.\" Johansson isn't alone in feeling that way. For many men and women, monogamy just doesn't feel right —and that's totally OK. Johansson told Playboy she definitely respects monogamous relationships—and yes, she's participated in them—but she just feels it isn't \"natural\" for her. \"I think it definitely goes against some instinct to look beyond,\" she said. Johansson, being the famous star that she is, has had her love life play out in the media. She's been married twice, first to Ryan Reynolds from 2008 to 2011, and second to Romain Dauriac, with whom she has a daughter. She married Dauriac in 2014, and last month the couple announced they're splitting . As for her thoughts on marriage, Johansson told the mag it's something she's seen change relationships. \"Being married is different than not being married, and anybody who tells you that it’s the same is lying,\" she said. \"It changes things. I have friends who were together for 10 years and then decided to get married, and I’ll ask them on their wedding day or right after if it’s different, and it always is. It is. It’s a beautiful responsibility, but it’s a responsibility.\" Whether you agree with Scarlett Johansson or not, it's great to hear her speak so candidly about a topic we can relate to: relationships. Monogamous relationships, open relationships—it's all about different strokes for different folks. And it's important to find what feels right and \"natural\" for you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:32:21.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
