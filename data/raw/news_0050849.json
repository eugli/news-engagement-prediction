He says the phrase \"eeny meeny miny moe\" before wielding the bat, which he calls \"Lucille,\" on his victims: Credit: Screener TV \nWhen a UK couple saw the shirt, though, they did not appreciate the reference: they called the shirt \"offensive.\" \nMethodist minister Ian Lucraft and his wife, Gwen , claimed that the shirt was racist. According to The Mirror he said, \"It was fantastically offensive and I can only assume that no one in the process of ordering it knew what they were doing or were aware of its subliminal messages.\" \nLucraft said this is because the \"Eeny Meeny Miny Moe\" rhyme originally included a racial slur. He said \"everyone knows\" the \"tiger\" was initially \"n \" in the common rhyme. \nCheck out Twitter reactions to the shirt 7 PHOTOS Social reactions to 'racist' Primark shirt See Gallery Social reactions to 'racist' Primark shirt Primark has had to pull this Tshirt from its stores cos it was deemed offensive and Racist..
