The transformation of nearly 150 acres, which is expected to start later this year, cleared one of its final hurdles when directors from the Erie County Industrial Development Agency and its affiliated Buffalo and Erie County Industrial Land Development Corp., agreed to purchase the property from Tecumseh Real Development Inc. for $6.7 million. In all, the 147.7-acre Lackawanna parcel that sits along the Route 5 border of the… more Jim Courtney In all, the 147.7-acre Lackawanna parcel that sits along the Route 5 border of the Bethlehem Steel site will be remediated at an estimated price tag of $10.78 million. The deal, many years in the works, has been a top economic development priority for Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz. “This is the type of project that when we look back 20 or 30 years from now, we will see it has had a big impact,” Poloncarz said. “This is a game changer.” Once the property is made shovel-ready, which should happen by early 2018, it will be marketed by the ECIDA and county staff along with other agencies including Invest Buffalo Niagara and private real estate firms. Because of its geography, the site can be serviced by trucks, rail or lake freighters. That is considered a major plus, the county executive said. “There are very few large, industrial sites like this in the Northeast,” Poloncarz said. A portion of the property will house the ECIDA’s Zero Net Energy building. The parcel also neighbors Welding Tube’s four-year-old plant. It is also near the Buffalo Lakeside Commerce Park, another fledgling industrial park off Route 5 that was developed on a former brownfield property. Poloncarz said there is some preliminary interest from would-be tenants for the property. “The project is a legacy project,” said Maria Whyte , Erie County deputy executive who served as the point person in the lengthy negotiations with the Amsterdam-based Tecumseh. “It has the potential for setting up an advanced manufacturing climate that will carry us into the next generation.” Part of the project includes bringing a one-mile long bike and walking trail that parallels Route 5 and will take people to the Smoke’s Creek Bridge and connects with other walking trails heading into Woodlawn and Hamburg. Poloncarz and Whyte estimate slightly more than 100 acres will be available for redevelopment purposes. “This is about restoring an old industrial site, one based on smoke stack industries, and turning into a high-tech, green site,” Poloncarz said.
