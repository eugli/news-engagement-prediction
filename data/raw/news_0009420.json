But Issa said he could not support a rule \"deliberately done at the end of the administration.\" Issa also said the effect of the weeks-old rule was \"catastrophic\" to the coal industry, and said Obama left them a \"landmine\" the new Congress was clearing. However, the move from Congress to revoke the rule means the interior department can not pass similar regulation again -- regardless of timing. It would instead take an act of Congress to impose a new coal regulation rule like the Stream Protection Rule. Given the overwhelming Republican opposition to the regulation, such a move is unlikely.
