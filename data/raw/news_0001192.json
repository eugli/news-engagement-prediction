The Tigers were 8-0, and Florida State would visit Death Valley the next day. And Swinney was breaking down as he spoke at the groundbreaking for the new football operations facility.\nTigerillustrated.com You might have read this account of his speech before. Even if you have, it’s important you read it again:\n“I’ve just been full of emotion the whole year,” Swinney said, alluding to his father’s passing a few months earlier. An extended pause followed as he tried to compose himself. Someone in the audience shouted, “We love you Dabo!” Applause followed, and Swinney began to lose it again before turning his back to the crowd. He used his suit jacket to wipe away the tears.\n“It takes a lot of people,” Swinney said before another pause. “It’s rare in college that you have everything kind of working in the same direction. I’ve seen where the president doesn’t like the AD, the AD don’t like the president. The head coach thinks he calls all the shots, he doesn’t understand the chain of command. The Board of Trustees don’t like whatever. I’ve seen that. It’s an ugly thing. Everybody worries about who gets the credit. But I’ve never been a part of a better situation than the one we have right now at Clemson as far as the synergy, the unity of spirit. Clemson has a determined spirit. And that’s why we’re having success.”\nSo here we sit, 15 months and 142,500 completed sparkling square feet later, and the task is to put into perspective the football program’s move into an opulent paradise that puts Clemson miles ahead of the competition.\nTigerillustrated.com At the moment of the groundbreaking, things were going pretty darned well for the Tigers during a magical season. It was all new and surreal, the sight of that team outlasting Notre Dame and pillaging Miami and putting itself atop the heap.\nThe outlook seemed grand at the time. But grand enough to include back-to-back national title prize fights against Alabama, and a championship trophy to include among the new furniture?\nThe timing of all this is what’s so exquisite and almost dream-like. Just when you think things can’t get any better, they get better with the latest commitment of a sought-after recruit.\nAnd, really, commitment is what this incredible story is all about. Not the commitment of Johnny 5-star. But the commitment of school to coach, and vice-versa.\nIf you were sitting there for Swinney’s emotional speech at the groundbreaking, or if you weren’t there and you merely read the words, the most important takeaway had to be: This guy is going to be at Clemson for a long time.\nFor so long Clemson couldn’t figure out who and what it wanted to be. Yes, they wanted to win at football. But they didn’t want to create the appearance that they wanted to win at all costs. Because the cost of the messy divorce with Danny Ford , and the NCAA issues that contributed to it, was deemed too much for the school to live with.\nTigerillustrated.com They were seemingly so close at points under Tommy Bowden , but ultimately they were a big tease during those years. That flirtation with prominence, coupled with a complete flip in the rivalry with South Carolina, led the bigwigs to get serious about football.\nAnd they had to show some serious faith in a young former receivers coach who was leading the program. There were flashes in those first few years, reasons to believe. But there were also ample reasons to doubt. Because before the 2009 team found its stride and claimed the Atlantic Division, it was losing three of its first five games and finding a way to fall against a putrid Maryland team. Because after the 2010 team outplayed an Auburn team that would win it all, after it finally knocked off Georgia Tech, it would lose to Boston College and get smashed by South Carolina and fall to South Florida in a no-account bowl.\nEven in 2011, after the 8-0 start that created such a wonderful sensation that the Board of Trustees committed to making Chad Morris the richest coordinator in the game, they lost four of their last six games and had to get lucky at home against Wake Forest just to win their division. And, yeah, the 70-spot in the Orange Bowl.\nThe point is, signing off on whatever Swinney wants now is the trendy thing to do. Not signing off on what he wants would be a truly stupid thing to do, given the 28 wins in the last 30 games and the national title and all.\nTigerillustrated.com But this hasn’t always been the case. Six years ago, the university and athletics department announced a major facilities expansion that would include finishing off the West End Zone. This came after that ugly loss to South Florida in front of all those blue seats in Charlotte. This came as Swinney was firing assistants Billy Napier and Andre Powell , and as Chris Rumph was bolting for Alabama. This came when there was considerable reason to doubt whether Swinney could be a successful coach, let alone a coach who could rise to the peak of his profession.\nSwinney had established himself as a successful coach at the point when the idea of this operations facility was hatched. But soon a $30 million idea became a $55 million idea, and there was reason for skepticism. Because, well, uh, weren’t all those donors who stroked those huge checks for the West End Zone told that was football’s forever home?\nThe vision made perfect sense to Swinney and Thad Turnipseed , the man who came from Alabama and put his fingerprints all over this new endeavor. To get ahead, you don’t do what the competition is doing. You do more than what they’re doing. You bring everyone else to their knees with big ideas, and the fruition of this live-work-play concept for coaches and players – DaboLand, as it’s called now – is staggering even to those who have been part of the planning all along.\nSo even though Swinney was winning when he pitched this idea to the heavy hitters, even though everyone believed he was the guy who’d bring the glory days to the present, it still took some faith for everyone to sign off on this palace.\nTigerillustrated.com And you don’t get that faith without the remarkable alignment and cohesion and camaraderie up and down the chain of command at Clemson. Heck, this idea even required faith from AD Dan Radakovich . Because normally it’s the AD and his people who are presiding over such a monstrous project. Instead, Radakovich and right-hand-man Graham Neff basically signed off on allowing Swinney, Turnipseed, Woody McCorvey and others control of it. Folks, this doesn’t happen everywhere.\n“Everything we’ve asked for, we’ve gotten,” Turnipseed has said about a million times over the past few months as he’s showed off the progress of the ops facility.\nSince Clemson knocked off Nick Saban’s empire, you’ve probably heard a few national pundits say Alabama’s list to replace Saban when he decides to leave should contain one name and one name only.\nGoing after Swinney is a no-brainer given his enormous achievement at Clemson, given his Alabama roots and all. But whoever’s in charge of that search, whenever it happens, would be wise to have more than one name on the list.\nBecause anyone who is paying any attention has to know that Swinney could turn down everyone, even his alma mater, to remain at the place he’s built into a monster that’s showing no sign of weakening.\nIs it a slam-dunk that he stays? Probably not. But it’s neither a slam dunk that he goes, and that’s quite a remarkable fact given his ties to the Crimson Tide.\nTigerillustrated.com Swinney will speak again tomorrow at the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and again he’ll probably get emotional. Because, well, it’s been an emotional week after he lost his close friend and agent Mike Brown to cancer.\nHe’ll also be emotional about the same thing he got weepy over less than 15 months ago in front of those people and those shovels.\nOn the eve of National Signing Day, the most important binding commitment of all is the one between coach and school. It goes both ways, and that is hard to beat.\nNot a subscriber to Tigerillustrated.com ?
