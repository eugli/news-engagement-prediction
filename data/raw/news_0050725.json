This is the jail from which outlaw John Dillinger escaped in broad daylight in 1934.\nAlcatraz (Credit: AP) Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in San Francisco Bay on June 12, 1962, the day three prisoners escaped. The men crawled through holes they'd cut in their cell walls, climbed to the roof and left on a raft fashioned from prison raincoats and rubber cement. They were never found; officials surmised they may have drowned before reaching shore. \nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISE HERE (Credit: AP) An exhibit about a 1962 prison escape made famous in the movie \"Escape from Alcatraz\" in the cell house museum store on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco in 2007. The three escapees, Clarence Anglin, John Anglin and Frank Morris, were believed to have escaped using an inflatable raft and were never heard from again. The FBI has never determined if they lived or died.\nFrank Abagnale (Credit: spielberg-ocr.com) One of the most famous con men in American history, Frank Abagnale, was known for elaborate forgeries and schemes, leading to his portrayal by Leonardo DiCaprio in Steven Spielberg's \"Catch Me If You Can\" in 2002. Abagnale's most famous escape came in April 1971, when, after a U.S. marshal forgot his detention papers, he convinced guards he was an undercover prison inspector.\n(Credit: AP) Tom Hanks, Jennifer Garner, Steven Spielberg, Frank Abagnale and Leonardo DiCaprio, from left to right, at a special screening of the film \"Catch Me If You Can,\" Monday, Dec. 16, 2002, in the Westwood section of Los Angeles. \nT.J.
