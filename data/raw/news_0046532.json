(Debra L Rothenberg/Getty Images) Monday, February 20, 2017, 5:24 PM \nDavid Cassidy announced Monday that he’s suffering from dementia. \nThe singer revealed to People that he’s battling the same disease from which his mother and grandfather suffered. \n“I was in denial, but a part of me always knew this was coming,” he told the magazine. \nThe news comes after the former “Partridge Family” star’s disastrous performance at The Canyon Club in Agoura, Calif., on Saturday. The actor and singer, shown here in 1972, said he “was in denial” about his diagnosis. (Garrett, Jim) \nCassidy, 66, was slurring his words throughout the show, even falling off the stage at one point. \nHe also reportedly told crowds that Sunday night at the Santa Barbara Performing Arts Center would be his last show, but BB Kings confirmed to the Daily News that he is still scheduled for his March 4 show. \n“I want to focus on what I am, who I am and how I’ve been without any distractions,” Cassidy told People . “I want to love. I want to enjoy life.” \nThe former teen heartthrob has struggled with alcoholism in the past, including a rehab stint in 2014 after his third arrest for driving under the influence.
