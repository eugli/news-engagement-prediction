It is the biggest terrorist and it has continued to play the 'terrorism card' to delegitimise the revolution,\" said Hariri.\n\"Until this moment, we have not found a serious partner for peace and stability in Syria.\" \n'1,161 civilians killed' Air strikes and ground battles have steadily increased over the past month as pro-government forces press offensives on key opposition areas such as besieged East Ghouta in the Damascus countryside, the besieged neighbourhood of al-Waer - the last rebel-held area in Homs - and the province of Deraa in the country's south.\nDuring Monday's press conference, Hariri accused the government of killing 1,161 civilians - including 216 children and more than 150 women - since a nationwide ceasefire went into effect on December 30. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the figures.\nRebel leader and negotiator Mohammed Alloush, who led talks last month in Astana but has kept a low profile since arriving to Geneva, told Reuters earlier on Monday that the uptick in violence was a sign that the Russians have failed to enforce the truce despite promises from the \"highest levels of the Russian delegation\".\nWhile the lineup of Russia's delegation for Tuesday's meeting has not yet been finalised, it could include Russia's Middle East director Sergei Vershinin, who attended the talks in Astana, and possibly Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov, who arrived in Geneva on Monday to take part in the annual UN Human Rights Council meeting.\n\"We sincerely hope to persuade Russia to stand by the Syrian people,\" said Hariri. \"We hope that Russia will bet on the Syrian people instead of one person who has decided to destroy the whole of Syria so as to remain in power.\"\nDe Mistura, who is charged with keeping the talks alive, has so far met with both sides in separate meetings, and is set to meet again with the government delegation on Tuesday.\nWhile bilateral meetings thus far have primarily only covered issues relating to the format of the talks, the UN's goal is to bring government and opposition delegations together to discuss elements of a \"transition\" in Syria, including governance, a constitution and elections.\nFor the Syrian opposition, the only route for lasting peace remains a political transition that ensures Assad's removal, but the government in Damascus has consistently refused to consider the president's removal an option.\nFollow Dylan Collins on Al Jazeera: @collinsdyl \nDo talks on Syria serve any purpose? – Inside Story \nSource: Al Jazeera \nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:14:12.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
