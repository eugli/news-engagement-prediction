I am sure as volumes (of digital transactions) are increasing, the charges will come down,\" the Finance Minister told members of the Rajya Sabha during the Question Hour. \n\nJaitley said that under the Payments and Settlements Act, the RBI has held that for cash transactions upto Rs 1,000, the MDR rate would be 0.25 per cent while for transactions upto Rs 2,000 it has been fixed at 0.50 per cent. \n\nHe said that for transactions above Rs 2,000, the RBI is considering the rate to be applied and this is a \"work in progress.\" \n\nJaitley also said the rate for debit card transactions in petrol companies, the charge is being absorbed by oil companies, while it is being absorbed by the government for digital transactions for rail travel. \n\nNewer technologies are making digital transactions cheaper and it is expected that more people would move towards them, he said, adding that the government has also advised its officials to use digital money. \n\nResponding to another question on the demonetisation decision, Jaitley said the RBI had begun printing the new currency well in advance but it was the process of recalibration of ATM machines that took time. \n\nRecalibration could not be done in advance for reasons of secrecy, he said. \n\nHe was asked as to why the government had issued Rs 2000 notes if the aim to discontinue the Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes was that people were hoarding cash. \n\nThe Finance Minister said demonetisation was one of the steps that the government has taken to curb the menace of black money and there have been many others right since the government took charge, including formation of an SIT to tackle this problem. \n\nHe also said that the government has taken steps to ensure that round-tripping of black money through some countries can be curbed.
