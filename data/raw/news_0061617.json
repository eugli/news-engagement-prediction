A sign of where the focus of the series lies for now, perhaps …? \n( Rogue One is entirely absent from the poster, unless you count a Death Star appearance. Similarly, there are no sneak peeks at the cast from the just-started-shooting Han Solo stand-alone to be found, either.) \nStar Wars Celebration runs April 13-17 at the Orange County Convention Center.
