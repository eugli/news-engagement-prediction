Less than a fortnight in, Trump’s administration is already having an impact on the way Britons think about Brexit. by Donald Trump holding hands with Theresa May along The Colonnade at the White House on January 27, 2017 following May’s two-day visit to Washington, D.C. By Christopher Furlong/Getty Images. If forced to choose between Europe and America at any time in the last 70 years, a majority of the British people would have opted for America. We bonded through two world wars; we share a language and many aspirations. While most Americans are unaware of what Britain calls the “special relationship” between the U.S. and U.K., successive governments in London have believed it to be the keystone of foreign policy. Yet, in truth, it is the hero worship of a kid trailing in the wake of an oblivious older brother. In the weeks after Donald Trump’s inauguration, and his subsequent executive order banning travelers from seven majority Muslim countries, the dynamic appears to be changing. Last week, British prime minister Theresa May became the first world leader to visit Trump, and the occasion has already backfired on her. The visit, itself, appeared hasty and a touch desperate. There was also an unfortunate (and slightly bewildering) photograph of the two holding hands, which brought to mind the mouth-to-mouth embrace shared by Leonid Brezhnev and East Germany’s Erich Honecker in 1979. Trump and May didn’t go that far—thank God!—but the intimacy of leaders has the power to churn millions of stomachs, and so it was in the U.K. After departing America, May subsequently flew to the quick-setting dictatorship in Turkey to discuss a £100 million arms deal. That was also not a particularly good look. Worse, while she was in the air, Trump’s controversial executive order came into force. And so May, who took off in relatively triumphant mood, landed to a press conference where reporters laughed and smirked when she was asked about the order and repeatedly refused to condemn it. Things got even worse for May when it became known that she had offered Trump a state visit, which would mean that the Queen would host the Trumps for an extended stay. There was even mention of Trump wanting to play the private golf course at Balmoral Castle , Her Majesty’s Highland residence, while she looked on. (You can imagine her face.) The former head of the Foreign Office, Lord Ricketts , wrote a letter to the Times of London suggesting that the whole visit would put the Queen “in a very difficult position,” and May would have to move fast to protect Her Majesty from controversy. For Americans, this has all the importance of a Ruritanian tea party, but it is a big deal in Britain. One wonders if May ruthlessly used the Queen as social bait in order to become the first foreign leader permitted to see Trump. Notions that May clinched a great trade deal in the States, and thus provided a crucial market for British goods in its post-Brexit landscape, was quickly disparaged. And the idea that Trump would be asked to address the House of Parliament, as part of the visit, has almost had some M.P.s projectile vomiting. Nearly 80 members signed a motion deploring the executive order and calling on the parliamentary authorities and the May government to withhold the invitation. The debate on his state visit will be held in the House of Commons on February 20 . Meanwhile, across the country, a new generation of demonstrators, inspired by the women’s march, took to the streets in surprisingly large numbers to protest the executive order. Trump is proving quite a unifying force here, even in these days of division, and if he comes, hundreds of thousands may demonstrate. Feelings are running high—not against America, as was the case during the Vietnam War demonstrations of the late 60s, and the Iraq marches in 2003—but specifically against the very bad odor that arises from the White House. To many, Trump looks and smells like a tyrant, and they are not going to sit idly by—not, as they would have it, like their European forebears did in the 30s. May now appears to be isolated by a very large group of decent-minded Brits, who accept that she must find new trade deals but don’t want her running into the arms of an avowed protectionist. Particularly one who does not appear to give one solitary hoot about British jobs—and may be happy to watch May hurt the European Union as best she can. Alex Salmond , the former Scottish first minister, called her visit to the White House and state visit invitation an “embarrassment.” Less than a fortnight in, Trump’s administration is already having an impact on the way Britons think about Brexit. Would they rather stay with Europe or go with America—and a man who, let’s face it, has never proved the easiest of business partners, as a number of lawsuits against him attest? This could affect opinion over the coming months, but probably not in time for the British to avoid committing one of the greatest follies in their history. It was just agonizing to watch the start of the two-day House of Commons debate on the triggering Article 50, which would trigger Brexit, and began on Tuesday, knowing that the government could not even be bothered to produce the standard “white paper” policy document on its proposals for leaving the E.U. The fact that two-thirds of M.P.s were in favor of remaining, but are so hexed by the narrow populist margin in favor of leaving, was even more depressing. The hero of the hour was Conservative Kenneth Clarke , a 76-year-old Conservative M.P. and the sole remaining “big beast” of British politics, who has represented the same constituency for 47 years. Clarke rose early to speak in the debate, and with wise and good-natured words he tore into the arrant stupidity of the government’s position. He is one of the very few to respect the truth, and he did not mind pointing to his younger colleagues, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove , and the lies that were told about Britain’s prospects outside the E.U. by the Leave campaign. By the time he rounded on Mrs. May, she had scuttled from the chamber. Referring to Alice in Wonderland , this is how he characterized her government’s policy: “Apparently you follow the rabbit down the hole and you emerge in a wonderland where suddenly countries around the world are queuing up to give us trading advantages and access to their markets that previously we had never been able to achieve as part of the European Union,” he said . “Nice men like President Trump and President Erdoğan are just impatient to abandon their normal protectionism and give us access. No doubt there is somewhere a Hatter holding a tea party with a dormouse.” Some will argue that M.P.s are keeping their powder dry in order to fight during the long process of Britain’s negotiation to leave the E.U. Others may note that they are also waiting to see the results of elections in Europe—particularly in Germany and France, where the far right is making ground. But watching these politicians during the debate—some crazed with a romantic and nationalist dream, others silenced by fear—doesn’t give you a lot of hope. What does give you a lift are not only the Clarkes, but also the people protesting on the streets and the restless citizens who refuse to stand idly by. A woman named Gina Miller took the government to court and won an action that compelled May to obey democratic precepts and debate a bill. Slight and absurd though it is, Miller has more guts than many of those M.P.s.
