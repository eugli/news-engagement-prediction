Take #smoking out of child & youth rated movies: https://t.co/s11HxUlNeW #NotSmokingHot pic.twitter.com/D1guwXLBsS \n— BC Lung Association (@BCLungAssoc) February 22, 2017 \nBC Healthy Living Alliance says there is compelling international and Canadian evidence linking youth smoking to smoking imagery in films. \n“Most people who smoke started smoking when they were young,” said Scott McDonald, Chair of the BC Healthy Living Alliance and CEO of the BC Lung Association. “Very few people start smoking after the age of 21 — 98 per cent of smokers are smoking by the time they are 17.” \nMcDonald says many film producers choose to feature smoking in their productions to achieve a certain character portrayal. \n“It shows that the person who is smoking is not controlled by societal norms – a tough guy or woman who has a mind of their own,” he said. “Young people may relate to that. They may also want to be rebellious and part of that rebellion may be to smoke.” \nHe says their goal is to have movies rated differently depending on whether they feature smoking. \n“We’d like to see the classification system think about smoking depictions in films, such that films where smoking is depicted are rated R, so that young people are not exposed to the use of tobacco by their idols.” \nMcDonald does not believe a revamp of the rating system would equate to censorship. \n“If the directors and producers feel that they need to include smoking in the film, then they should also understand that the film might be rated such that the audience will be restricted to adults only – it would be a commercial and artistic choice.” \nMcDonald says, compared to B.C., there are more restrictions on tobacco depiction in movies in other provinces and the U.S. \nHe says they have expressed their concerns to the B.C. government, but have not heard anything back yet. \n“We are going to continue to pressure the government to try to have the film classification rating changed to include depictions of tobacco use,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:34:31.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
