Sponsored 13 realities of going wedding dress shopping \nThe 90-minute long programme has been caught in a wave of controversies today. \nThose who weren’t outraged by chef Anna Haugh’s raw chicken and cross-contamination issues were instead not happy about seeing a whole octopus being boiled. Distressing scenes (Picture: BBC) \nChef Nieves Barragan cooked her recipe for Gallacian octopus which involved ‘scaring’ the animal, a process where the mollusk is tenderised by being dipped in boiling water. \nPresenter Matt Tebbutt made a point of reassuring viewers that the octopus was not alive during the process. \nBut fans were not satisfied and many took to Twitter to broadcast their disagreement: A beautiful octopus butched live on bbc1 10am 😲 #SaturdayKitchen \n— Rob Walker (@robwalker909) February 11, 2017 #SaturdayKitchenpoor old octopus! Worse thing I've ever seen on Saturday kitchen! \n— Sian Morgan-Lloyd (@SianMorganLloy3) February 11, 2017 @SaturdayKitchen just been watching saturday kitchen was horrified that they have just put a live octopus in boiling water on live tv. \n— Shirley Durance (@sellbynow) February 11, 2017 #SaturdayKitchen WHY dip such an HUGE octopus in boiling water just to use a couple of the ends of its tentacles??? Is this a joke ??? #BBC \n— Syed Abdul Razak (@tweetfeelsgood) February 11, 2017 \nSome took a stand against the programme not for animal rights reasons but for being out of touch with every day cooks: #SaturdayKitchen gets more pretentious every week. Who in the U.K. Is going to cook octopus 🐙 \n— Paul Kirk (@PaulBKirk) February 11, 2017 Used to be much more homely. Who is going to cook that octopus 🐙 dish? Looked vile anyway. #saturdaykitchen \nAnd for others it was just vomit territory: When the chef dunked that massive octopus in the pan #SaturdayKitchen pic.twitter.com/w7US1imCir \n— ✨🌜ash🌛✨ (@ashlienicolee) February 11, 2017 \nFor a light-hearted morning cooking show Saturday Kitchen has had its fair share of controversial moments. \nFrom Will Young being blasted for swearing on the show in 2015 to Jamie Oliver being criticised for his innuendos in 2016 the show has often prompted a reaction. \nThe BBC have been contacted for comment. \nFor more Entertainment stories, like Metro Entertainment on Facebook.
