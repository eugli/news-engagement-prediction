I love you so much. To my family, mama , papa, Jeff [unintelligible], you kicked this off, and Damien Chazelle, for standing on your shoulders… We lost, by the way. But, you know. There’s a mistake.” \nThere was obviously a lot of confusion up there and frustration on Berger's, part and it must have been an infuriating and humiliating thing to be put through, but a lot of people weren’t impressed with him ploughing on with his acceptance speech.\nFred Berger really stood there, KNOWING his movie did not win the #Oscars , & said I'm giving my speech anyway. That is the essence of ASS.\n— Carmen Santos (@revealingmia) February 27, 2017 Be a Jordan Horowitz (\"there's a mistake\" guy), not a Fred Berger (\"we lost by the way, but you know\" guy). #Oscars #BestPicture https://t.co/wa2DMz0hxI \n— Nic Mayne (@maynenic) February 27, 2017 Fred Berger knew he had lost but gave his speech anyway.
