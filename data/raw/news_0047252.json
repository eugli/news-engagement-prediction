Fans React To DeMarcus Cousins Trade February 20, 2017 8:31 AM   (Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images) \nSACRAMENTO (CBS13) â€“ After years of talk about possible trades, the end of the DeMarcus Cousins era has come for Sacramento. \nNews broke Sunday evening that the Kings traded their All-Star center to the New Orleans Pelicans. The Kings are reportedly getting Buddy Hield, Langston Galloway, first and second round picks in 2017, and former Kings top draft pick Tyreke Evans in return for Cousins (and Omri Casspi). \nIn the eyes of many Kings and NBA fans around the league, however, Sacramento was robbed. The Nuggets got more first-round picks for Timofey Mozgov than the Kings got for DeMarcus Cousins. \nâ€” devin kharpertian (@uuords) February 20, 2017 \nConsidering how Cousins is one of the most talented â€“ if not the best â€“ big men in the league, many joked about how underwhelming the trade was.

Pistons attempted a deal with Andre Drummond to the Kings for DeMarcus Cousins. Kings said no.
