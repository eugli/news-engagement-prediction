She also had two different identities. \nMalaysian authorities have identified her as Siti Aisyah, 25, from Serang, Indonesia, based on the passport she was holding when she was arrested.\nAccording to Indonesian news portal Kumparan, based on identification records held by her village in Angke, Jakarta West, she had two separate entries, complete with different photos.\nIn the first one, her name is spelt as “Siti Aisyah,” with information saying she was born in Serang, Indonesia, on Feb 11, 1992. In the accompanying picture, her hair is tied in a ponytail.\nIn the second entry, her name was written as “Siti Aisah” and her date of birth is listed as Nov 1, 1989. In this picture, her hair is worn loose.\nKumparan reported that the ID (identification) numbers as well as her occupation on both entries differed.\nAs “Siti Aisyah,” she listed her occupation as entrepreneur; as “Siti Aisah,” she listed her occupation as housewife.\nKumparan quoted Angke village head Dwi Ariyono as saying that he did not know why Siti Aisyah had two separate IDs.\nSiti Aisyah was also divorced, according to Indonesian news portal Detik.com.\nHer mother-in-law Lian Kiong or Akiong, 56, told Indonesian Foreign Ministry officials on Friday that she and her family had no relationship with her since she divorced her husband Gunawan Hasyim.\nA sealed handwritten letter dated Feb 1, 2012 was presented to the Foreign Ministry on Friday.\nSigned by Siti Aisyah and Gunawan, with Lin Kiong as witness, the letter said that the couple had opted for a divorce as they no longer “possessed the compatibility and harmony of husband and wife.”\nLian Kiong said that following the divorce, Siti Aisyah hardly visited her in-laws in Tambora in West Jakarta, and only came around once a year to meet her seven-year-old son Rio.\n“After the divorce, she never came around. The last time she came was on Jan 28.\n“She came and stayed for the night. She spent the night with my grandson and left the next day,” Detik.com quoted Lian Kiong as saying.\nShe added that Rio had previously even refused to meet his mother because he knew she would leave eventually.\nKumparan reported that Siti Aisyah’s involvement in Jong-nam’s murder began when she was approached by a mysterious man at the nightclub that she worked at in Kuala Lumpur.\nThe man reportedly offered her US$100 (RM445) to carry out the act, which she believed to be a prank.\nShe is said to have accepted the deal because “she needed the money,” despite not knowing who Jong-nam or her other accomplices were.\nShe previously worked as a domestic helper in Jakarta before moving to Malaysia in 2013 with her then-husband.\nSiti Aisyah was arrested by Malaysian police at 2am on Thursday after she was identified based on CCTV footage from KL International Airport 2 (KLIA 2).\nJong-nam, 45, was killed by two women who splashed his face with a chemical at the KLIA2 departure hall at about 9am on Monday. He was about to leave for Macau.\nThe women later got into a taxi and fled.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:23:35.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
