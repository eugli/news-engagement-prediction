The new 3-layer CMOS sensor — an industry first — can capture slow motion video about eight times faster than its competition with minimal focal pane distortion, according to Sony.\nThe sensor can also take 19.3MP images in 1/120th of a second, which Sony says is four times faster than other chips, thanks to high-capacity DRAM, and a 4-tier construction on the circuit section used to convert analog video signals to digital signals. \nAll of that fancy camera talk basically means this sensor blows every camera currently in a smartphone out of the water. Although the iPhone 7 and the Google Pixel can shoot 1080p slow-motion video at 120fps, they are still miles behind what Sony has reached with its latest sensor. At 1,000fps it even surpasses the Sony RX 100 V , which can only shoot at 960fps.\nGiven that both Apple and Google use Sony sensors in their cameras, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to capture even more incredible slow-motion video on your phone in the next couple years. And hopefully 32GB phones will be a thing of the past by then as well, as 1,000fps full HD video would eat up your storage space in an instant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T18:35:11.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
