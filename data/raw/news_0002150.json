Of course, the movement didn’t start with the events of 2016; white supremacy has existed in this country as long as the United States itself, though that ideology didn’t really codify into the faction we know now until much later. The birth of white nationalism, and the role it played in the nation’s most infamous act of domestic terrorism, are the subject of the latest American Experience film, Oklahoma City —a chilling examination of the events that led to the titular bombing, which killed 168 people (including 19 children) in 1995. Get a glimpse of the film in the exclusive clip above, which begins to connect the dots between the 1992 standoff at Ruby Ridge with Timothy McVeigh, the eventual bomber. It’s a chilling examination of not-so-distant history—and a sobering reminder that radical rhetoric can have real consequences . Oklahoma City hits theaters in New York and Los Angeles this Friday, February 3, as well as select theaters nationally. It also airs February 7 on PBS.
