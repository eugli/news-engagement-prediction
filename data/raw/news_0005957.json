They should be out in the middle of America saying ‘what do we need to know from you?’ rather than sitting in Washington reelecting Nancy Pelosi after they lost the House three different times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T21:24:07.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
