Nick, Leeds \nI think Manchester United look very strong. I’d be very surprised if they didn’t win it. Mourinho has a fantastic record in this competition. 13:49 Wenger says he will go for a top European job if he quits Arsenal – where could you see him going? Simon, London \nWhen a person reaches this age, the assumption is that his story is tied to Arsenal. In that press conference he showed defiance and intelligence. It’s put it out there that his career is not reliant on Arsenal. It was very telling. \nHe is a black belt survivor. Wenger is going to carry on – he’s saying ‘if you want me, I’m here’. He’s not prepared to end his career. Wenger has made it clear that he will not be retiring from football management this year 13:42 What did you make of the Wayne Shaw eating a pie on the touchline for Sutton? Do you feel sorry for him now? Rudy, Las Vegas \nHe’s got a little bit carried away with himself. But you have to look at what he’s done for the club. He’s not just a goalkeeper, Wayne also manages the pitch. It’s a community pitch at Sutton – he spends hours and hours in an almost voluntary capacity running it. \nHe wasn’t best advised linking up with The Sun and SunBets. They have taken advantage of him, he’s been naive but he’s lost his job and his livelihood over this. He has a young family. It was a tongue in cheek thing. Yes, he was stealing the limelight slightly, it should be about the team. \nMaybe SunBets should be giving him a job. Without their influence he would never have been tied up in this. Sutton United's reserve goalkeeper Wayne Shaw has been sacked by the club 13:36 Does the constant Wenger in/out debate damage Arsenal as a whole? Reece, London \nNo, not at all. Wenger’s longevity gives the club a sense of respect, people know that longevity is rewarded. That is their philosophy. \nThe board and Arsene Wenger now need to decide whether he is the right man to go on. It’s as simple as that. Is it right for the club? Is it right for the owners? \nI’ve got a sneaking suspicion that if they qualify for the Champions League and do alright in the FA Cup, it’ll be status quo for next season. Why wouldn’t it be? \nThe only problem is that he hasn’t been able to put the flag on the summit recently – winning the Premier League. \nWhat really needs to be fixed is figuring out what changes need to be made to get Arsenal back to boiling point? What is the missing ingredient? The spotlight shines on Arsene Wenger at Sutton United on Monday night 13:31 Why do Arsenal players constantly seem to be out injured longer than first feared? Cazorla is the latest to be out for season. Luke, Brighton \nIt’s not really on Arsenal. It’s his achilles, which takes a long time to recover from. It’s the first thing that the weight is going through. The pitches they train on these days are very hard. If a player is not comfortable, he’s not really rid of it. \nCazorla’s injury is a time one, it just needs time. It’s a really tricky injury. There is nothing wrong with the medical team at Arsenal. He will be getting the best possible care. Arsene Wenger treats these guys like they are his sons. He will make sure that they have everything they need. \nArsenal’s injury problems actually seem to have improved this season. But it is costing Arsenal a lot – they need him. Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla has been ruled out for the rest of the season 13:24 What do you think of the Mustafi/Koscielny partnership? From @RianRosendaal \nThey have looked good in the main. Mustafi got caught out against Bayern Munich. There’s no shame in being caught out, but it’s fine lines that takes you from good to great. \nKoscielny has proven he is a top talent – he just needs the trophies. \nThere are one or two issues that need to be ironed out and they all revolve around crossing. Lewandowski scored a brilliant goal but it could have been eradicated. \nPeople remember the finished article and not the beginning – Mustafi is still at the beginning of his road at Arsenal. He needs to build the determination to ensure it doesn’t happen again. He needs to be more on red alert when he plays. Shkodran Mustafi (right) was exposed in the 5-1 defeat by Bayern Munich last week 13:18 Is Mourinho right to complain about fixture congestion? Ollie in Canterbury \nJose was always going to complain. I would not have been happy playing Monday night and Thursday. He has got a point. \nThis was always going to be a difficult one. The BBC were going to want to show that game. Looking at it selfishly, we now have a chance to see this on terrestrial TV. It’s a mouthwatering game. Manchester United are on fantastic form. \nAt first it seemed as though he was at war with his squad, but it’s now all gelling. It’s Mourinho going back to Chelsea. Conte has done what he’s done. Jose’s bigger concern will be getting Mkhitaryan and Carrick fit again. Jose Mourinho is not happy with Manchester United's fixture schedule 13:12 What did you make of City’s defensive performance against Monaco – how could it be improved? Chris in Reading \nWe should really be marvelling at the splendour of what we saw. In the game there were individual mistakes, but this is the theme of modern football. Everybody wants to attack. It makes for a much better spectacle. \nMost teams in the Premier League now go out to play and offer something both going forward and defensively. Chelsea are top of the table because they represent the best balance between attack and defence. \nCity’s brilliance in attack was enough to win them the game. That’s probably Pep Guardiola’s ideal game. \nIn an ideal world, you’d have had Vincent Kompany playing alongside Stones. It’s always nice when you’re a youngster when you have someone beside you nursing you through games – every so often an experienced call keeps you right. John Stones would benefit from having the experience of Vincent Kompany alongside him 13:07 How will he be remembered in England – where does he rank in the Premier League list of greats? \nI don’t think we should be writing him off or starting the tributes. I think there’s still a footballer in him. It’s all about desire now. \nThere’s still a tiger in him that needs to be let loose. Now is not the time to make a knee-jerk reaction to him. He’s one of the all-time great players, but he’s still got a lot to offer. \nWhen is the Wayne Rooney we know from years ago going to start fighting back? 13:00 What should Wayne Rooney do next? Dave in Manchester \nI have been aware for some time that Wayne has hardly been used when it really matters. \nIt’s a difficult one, but he has remained dignified and mature. Clearly Mourinho does not want to use him. I feel that he has still got a lot to offer. \nI wouldn’t be surprised if he ended up back at Everton. He’s 31-years-old! If I were him I wouldn’t accept the situation I find myself in. It’s far too young. \nYou could say he has a lot of mileage, but he’s pretty healthy. He’s not had a history of problems or injuries, he’s just got on with it. Wayne Rooney is set to leave Manchester United after falling out of favour {\"id\":\"4252468\",\"channel\":\"/sport\",\"pageUrl\":\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4252468/Arsenal-news-Arsene-Wenger-next.html\",\"status\":\"running\",\"greenBox\":{\"body\":\"\"},\"modifiedOrder\":1} 0 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:18:46.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
