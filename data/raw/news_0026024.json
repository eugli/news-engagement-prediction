Blue line banners honoring police hang along Main Street in Bel Air as the one-year anniversary of the deaths of Harford County Sheriff's Office deputies Patrick Dailey and Mark Logsdon approaches. The pair were shot to death on Feb. 10, 2016. (MATT BUTTON | AEGIS STAFF / Baltimore Sun) Staff report The Aegis Privacy Policy \nFriday marks one year since Harford County Sheriff's Office Senior Deputy Patrick Dailey and Deputy First Class Mark Logsdon were murdered, responding to a call for a suspicious person as the lunch hour was beginning at the busy Panera Bread Cafe in Abingdon's Boulevard at Box Hill shopping area. \nIt was only the fourth time in the 242-year history of the county that a law enforcement officer had died at the hands of another person, the first time it had happened in 30 years and the first time ever that two officers had died under those circumstances on the same day from the same incident. \n\"It is difficult to believe that it has been one year since our Harford County community and our brave men and women of the Sheriff's Office were shaken to the core by senseless acts of violence. On Friday, our Sheriff's Office family will mark the one year passage of time since our heroes, Senior Deputy Pat Dailey and Deputy First Class Mark Logsdon, were taken from us,\" Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said in a statement. \n\"Our agency is strong. On Feb. 10, we will stand together, in solemn remembrance, with Pat and Mark's families, offering them all the love and support of their Sheriff's Office family strengthened by the countless acts of kindness and generosity from our beloved community,\" Gahler continued. \"The men and women of our great agency continue to have such unwavering support, love and prayers from so many; I know those acts of kindness will help see us all through the difficult days ahead. For that we are eternally thankful.\" \nThere will be a number of observances during Friday's \"Day of Remembrance\" proclaimed by County Executive Barry Glassman. \nA moment of silence will be observed at noon at the memorial to the fallen deputies at the Boulevard at Box Hill Shopping Center, near the site of the shootings. Emergency sirens will also sound. Similar observances are planned at the county government administrative in Bel Air and on the campus of Harford Community College. \nIn the past year, many young people have graduated from local high schools, joined the work force or the military or gone on to college. Babies have been born, loved ones have died. \nLife has gone on, but for a few moments today, Harford and its residents will pause and remember where they were on Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016, reflecting on the events of that day and the loss of the two men who were career law enforcement officers, men whose deaths \"devastated their colleagues,\" as Gahler said at the time. \nOn that day, at about 11:45 a.m., Senior Deputy Dailey, a 30-year veteran of the Sheriff's Office assigned to the court services division, walked into Panera Bread in Abingdon in response to a call for a suspicious person. He was fatally shot where he sat as he tried to talk to the man.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T12:37:42.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
