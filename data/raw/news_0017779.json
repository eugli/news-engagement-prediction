Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) called out President Donald Trump in an interview posted online Thursday for failing to deliver on his campaign pledge to “ drain the swamp .” Trump had performed what could be “the most impressive 180 degree switch that you’ve ever seen” following his presidential election win in Nov. 2016, Warren told Attn: editor-in-chief Matthew Segal. Citing Trump’s promise to voters that he would “drain the swamp” and “get rid of those Wall Street guys,” Warren took issue with the new president for almost immediately bringing in Goldman Sachs bankers , lobbyists and CEOs of giant companies to help him govern. In doing so, Warren said Trump had turned over the country “to the very people that he had railed against during the campaign.” Check out the full interview above.
