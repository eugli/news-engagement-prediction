The film was a huge success at the box office and so was their on-screen chemistry. Filmmakers had found their new hit jodi in Priyanka and Akshay and within a year, the two signed three more films together. \nALSO READ: 5 things we didn't know about Akshay-Twinkle relationship \nBut as much as their on-screen romance was loved by the audience, their off-screen chemistry found its way into juicy tabloids. Their closeness sparked the rumours of an alleged affair. However, the two never publicly admitted to being in a relationship but what further strengthened the buzz was Twinkle's intervention. And reportedly that's when Akshay put a lid to all the speculation and vowed to never work with Priyanka again. \nAnd 12 years after their last film together, Akshay opened up on his fallout with Priyanka on Aap Ki Adalat . On being asked if Khiladi Kumar ever swore to never work with Priyanka again, he said, \"There is nothing like that. I have worked on five films with Priyanka. It's not like I don't want to work with her. Except for Rani Mukerji, I have worked with every heroine. If there is an opportunity, I will surely work with Priyanka Chopra.\" \nWhen further probed, the 49-year-old actor said, \"Let us call Priyanka Chopra and check if she has an issue with me. That way you will know for sure.\" \nWhile Akshay might refute any of the allegations but his rumoured love affair with Priyanka was the talk of the town back in the early 2000s. \nHow it all began \nWhile Akshay had objected to Priyanka's closeness in 2004 film Aitraaz, but the two couldn't keep themselves away from each other off the camera. Buzz has it that it was during this brief phase that two were believed to be together and very close. \nWhen Akshay-Twinkle almost called it quits \nBut Akshay's wife Twinkle was not ready to take things lying down. If a report in Times of India is to be believed, Twinkle soon reprimanded Akshay for his closeness to his co-actor. In fact, their report suggests that Akshay and Twinkle had a major showdown back in 2004 in Goa and it is believed that the reason for this public spat was Priyanka. However the couple rubbished the reports. \nAkshay vowed to never work with Priyanka again \nAkshay soon began to see cracks in his marriage. And buzz has it that Twinkle made Akshay swear to never take up any project with Priyanka. As a family guy with a two-year-old son, he immediately terminated his contacts with Priyanka. \nA lull for a decade \nIt was 2005 film Waqt: Race Against Time whem Akshay and Priyanka were seen together on screen for the last time. It been almost a decade, but the two have never worked together in any film. \nPriyanka's disinterest in working with Akshay again \nIn 2014, when Priyanka was told about Akshay's wish to work with her again, she was surprised, \"First of all, I don't think he said that.\" She later added that she is more interested in good scripts than her co-actors. \"I am just saying that I am not somebody who sits and wonders who my co-actors will be for a film. I always pick my films based on the script. If something interesting comes by, it does not EVER matter to be who my co-actors are,\" she added.
