This report outlines national and international requirements to reduce the risk of child-trafficking, extremism and modern slavery,\" Nikita Malik, a senior researcher at Quilliam, told the 'Observer' newspaper. \n\nThe report found that ISIS had offered up to 2,000 dollars to recruit within camps in Lebanon and Jordan. \n\nLast year, Jordanian special forces reportedly found what they described as an ISIS sleeper cell inside a refugee camp near Irbid, north Jordan. \n\nAdditional reports indicated that ISIS had tried to recruit refugees by supplying food previously withheld from camp residents, the newspaper reports. \n\nThe report said: \"Young unaccompanied refugees are more vulnerable to radicalisation if they are separated from their parents, who remained in the country of origin at risk to violent and radical groups, or in a new host country\". \n\n\"There is no question that militant groups target refugee youth for recruitment. It has also been argued that refugee youth can become autonomously radicalised, through online content, for example,\" the report said.
