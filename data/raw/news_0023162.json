It is to change the nominee who can garner the 60 votes. Because 60 votes means that it is almost definitionally a bipartisan, mainstream nominee.” \nMcConnell has repeatedly declined to say what he will do if Democrats filibuster, although he has also vowed that Gorsuch will be confirmed. \nEight Democrats could vote with the 52 Republicans to advance Gorsuch, but Schumer’s declaration suggests it’s unlikely. And if McConnell makes good on his pledge, it may well require the nuclear option to break a filibuster.
