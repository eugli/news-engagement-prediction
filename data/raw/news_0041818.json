A bill to this effect has been approved by MPs and is now under consideration in the House of Lords. \nMr Russell said the government had applied to intervene \"given the significance of the case for the UK's constitutional arrangements and the effect on devolved competence\". \nLord Advocate James Wolffe put forward arguments that the so-called Sewel convention of legislative consent was activated by the \"significant changes\" that Brexit would make to Holyrood. Image caption Lord Advocate James Wolffe put forward arguments for the Scottish government at the Supreme Court \nHe was supported in the preparation and presentation of his argument by external counsel, representing the bulk of the cost of the case, as well as Scottish government officials. \nLawyers for the UK government rejected Mr Wolffe's claims, saying the argument was \"fatally undermined\" by the fact powers over foreign affairs were reserved to Westminster. \nThe court unanimously found that the principle of legislative consent \"does not give rise to a legally enforceable obligation\". \nThe judges did note that the Sewel convention plays \"an important role in the operation of the UK constitution\", but said it was not a matter for the courts. They added: \"The devolved legislatures do not have a veto on the UK's decision to withdraw from the EU.\" \nThe full breakdown of the costs provided by the Scottish government was: External legal fees: £128,877.09 Court fee (application to intervene): £800 Room hire and catering at the Supreme Court: £510 Travel, accommodation and subsistence for government officials: £6230.84 \nThe Scottish Parliament subsequently held a non-binding vote on the matter of Article 50, which members voted by 90 to 34 to say it should not be triggered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:31:10.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
