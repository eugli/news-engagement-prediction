If you heard some faint sobbing in the distance Sunday night, it might have been your friendly neighborhood Walking Dead fans, trying to recover from a beautiful reunion: that of Daryl Dixon and Carol Peletier. These two have shared a unique, unbreakable bond since Season 2, when Daryl helped Carol cope with the loss of her daughter Sophia—and since then, their friendship has only grown stronger. In fact, with Glenn gone, Daryl and Carol’s relationship has in many ways become the most important and symbolic one in the entire series. That might be why the scenes Norman Reedus and Melissa McBride shared were by far the most powerful and meaningful moments of Sunday night’s episode. More discussion ahead, but beware the spoilers. Daryl and Carol’s screen time together was short, but significant. Daryl first learns about Carol’s whereabouts from Richard, who plans to incite war with Negan and force King Ezekiel into action. Predictably, Daryl is not a fan of this plan once he found out that the woman Richard planned to use as a sacrificial lamb for this plan was Carol—whom the main group hasn’t seen since before Glenn and Abraham’s deaths. “Living on her own like that, she might as well be dead right now,” Richard tells Daryl. Let’s just say Daryl doesn’t take it too well: “She gets hurt; she dies; she catches a fever; she gets taken out by a walker; she gets hit by lightning—anything. Anything happens to her, I’ll kill you.” Once he learns where Carol has made her new home, it’s no surprise that Daryl decides to swing by. The two share a wordless hug, as Daryl casts a rare, vulnerable look over her shoulder. Both are teary-eyed. His voice breaks just a little as he asks, “Why’d you go?” Her voice, too, is soft, as she murmurs, “I had to.” The next time we see them, enough time has passed for the sun to set and for Carol to make a crackling fire. “I couldn’t lose anyone,” she says. “I couldn’t lose any of them. I couldn’t lose you.” At this point, Daryl, Carol Rick, Carl, and Morgan are the only original Walking Dead characters left—and that history is what gives the conversation Daryl and Carol share next such significance. Carol explains that staying with the group may have meant being forced to kill again—and that if if she did that, she couldn’t live with herself. Then, she asks the question that’s somehow been avoided until now: did the Saviors come back for retribution? Daryl admits they did. Carol can barely get the words out, “Did anybody get hurt? Is everybody O.K.? Did the saviors—is everybody back home O.K.?” And that’s when Daryl makes the most interesting choice of the episode: he lies, saying that while the Saviors came, they were able to strike a deal with the opposing group. “Everyone’s alright.” He cracks a feeble joke, and the two sit down to eat some soup. Well, he eats—she mostly just watches him. (Shippers, enjoy—but remember, sometimes mood lighting and romantic vibes can be a bad sign.) Later on, once Daryl has returned to the Kingdom and left Carol to her self-imposed solitude, Morgan tells Daryl that lying to Carol shows that he—like everyone else—is still holding onto some shred of the way the world once was. Daryl could have told Carol what happened to Glenn and Abraham, Morgan observes—and she would have come back to fight Negan, just like Daryl wants to. But she seems to believe that another violent confrontation would destroy her—and Daryl isn’t ruthless enough to be O.K. with that outcome. He, better than anyone, knows that Carol has been through enough: abuse from her former husband, who eventually died; the disappearance and then loss of her daughter Sophia; disappointment after disappointment from the post-apocalyptic world. Through it all, he’s been there for her—and vice-versa, as he suffered his own tragedies. Their relationship has become a reminder of the most important thing at stake during the apocalypse: human connection and empathy. As the fight against Negan ramps up, that’s going to become increasingly important. As we saw on Sunday, Rick has found a new ally in the junkyard group —a clan that is entirely unique to the show. (This group does not appear in the comics.) The conceit is somewhat goofy: they appear to be a band of thieves who dress in all black and navy, have weird names, speak in stilted English, and keep a barbed zombie named Winslow in what is basically a trash-filled Sarlacc pit . But, much like the surface silliness of the Kingdom, it all sort of works—or, at the very least, at least it’s way more fun than an incessant parade of doom and gloom. We’ll have to wait and see how effective these guys can be as allies—but either way, it’s clear that Rick is ready to fight. Let’s just hope this time doesn’t bring too much collateral damage.
