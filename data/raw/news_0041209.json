Called Capital, the concept room is a posh sanctuary for clubbers who prefer to spend the night away smoking cigars in plush sofas while sipping on some of the world’s finest whiskies, including a bottle of Dalmore that costs $36,000. If that’s not up your alley, the whisky bar has up to 48 different types of whiskies for you to choose from, with a glass starting from $16. Entry to Capital costs $40 for men and $35 for women. (Photo: Zouk Singapore) More Zouk CEO Andrew Li said that the new opening aimed “ to encourage exploration and growth of taste in music through different concepts, each catering to different target groups and clubbing habits.” He added that Capital had been conceptualised with the sophisticated and affluent guest in mind. “While the space will present a very different climate from Zouk and Phuture, the DNA will still be deeply anchored in the music programming and beverage offerings that are unique to Zouk,” said Li. (Photo: Zouk Singapore) More Luxuriously planned by design studio Charnley Stadworth, the 640sqm space can accommodate up to 540 guests and will feature a dance floor, DJ console, island bar, whisky bar and cigar room. Several installations on the premises include works by Japanese artist Tetsuya Toshima and Indonesian sculptor Abdi Setiawan. The signature lighting was designed by the same Barcelona-based lighting firm LEDSCONTROL who conceived the light centerpiece in the main Zouk room.
