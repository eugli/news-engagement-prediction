Arsenal have completely disintegrated. An utter shambles and rudderless after koscielny went off. — Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) February 15, 2017 Martin Keown to @btsport \"It was embarrassing. This is his (Wenger's) lowest point.\" — Simon Stone (@sistoney67) February 15, 2017 \nP redictability is hardly restricted to their European campaigns; the Gunners' meek surrender away to Chelsea earlier this month was seen as yet another example of Arsenal fading when it mattered most that they stand up and be counted. \nAs an impressive Bayern set about Arsenal with a combination of flair and efficiency, the deepest flaws of the Wenger-assembled side were laid bare for all to see. \nFormer Arsenal forward Ian Wright tweeted his despair mid-game, before appearing to give up watching entirely as the goals to leak through the visitors' porous defence. \n\"We are a *", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:16:41.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
