Saudi Arabia admits it used UK-made cluster bombs in Yemen Read more \nWeapons sales to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations have faced intense scrutiny since the March 2015 start of a Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen , which has been accused of killing thousands of civilians and triggering a humanitarian catastrophe in one of the region’s poorest countries. \nSaudi Arabia is the UK’s most important arms client: since the start of the Yemen campaign government ministers have granted export licences for more than £3.3bn of aircraft, munitions and other equipment. \nUnder UK and EU arms sales rules, export licences must not be granted if there is a “clear risk” that the equipment could be used to break international humanitarian law. Licensing is overseen by Liam Fox , secretary of state for international trade, in consultation with the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence and Department for International Development. \nA spokeswoman for the Department for International Trade told the Guardian: “The UK is playing a leading role in work to find a political solution to the conflict in Yemen and to address the humanitarian crisis. \n“We operate one of the most robust export control regimes in the world and keep our defence exports to Saudi Arabia under careful and continual review. Given the current legal proceedings we will not be commenting further outside of court at this stage.” Saudi Arabia and UK-supplied cluster bombs: what do we know? Read more \nThe government’s arms sales to Saudi Arabia have come under sustained criticism from sources including MPs on the business and international development parliamentary select committees. \nLast year the two committees recommended that weapons export licences to the country should be suspended until an independent international inquiry into allegations of breaches of international law was completed. They found the government had failed to conduct credible investigations into how British weapons were being used. \nThe foreign affairs select committee, which refused to sign up to the committee recommendation, published its own report saying any decision on exports to Saudi Arabia should wait until the outcome of this week’s case. But it also called for an independent UN investigation into claims Saudi Arabia has broken international humanitarian law. The sales are overseen by Liam Fox, secretary of state for international trade. Photograph: PA \nThe government had said it cannot investigate individual allegations, but that the Ministry of Defence monitors claims to “form an overall view on the approach and attitude of Saudi Arabia” to the laws of war, which forbids indiscriminate targeting of civilians or civilian infrastructure. \nThe UN estimates that at least 4,619 civilians have been killed in the two-year conflict, and 19m people have been left needing humanitarian assistance. Allegations of war crimes have been made against both sides, and last January a leaked UN report described “widespread and systematic” targeting of civilians in Saudi-led strikes, including the bombing of health facilities, schools, wedding parties and camps for internally displaced people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:31:02.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
