(Jody Porter/CBC)\nForestry expert and CESO volunteer mentor Bill Pollock worked with the First Nations on a feasibility study for harvesting the trees.\n\"Go slowly — that was my whole theme of working with them,\" Pollock said. \"You work with what you've got and go from there. Work from the bottom up with the resources you've got.\"\nThat work is still proceeding slowly, according the Matawa economic development advisor, Jason Rasevych. Meanwhile, the discussions around economic development in each of the nine communities has inspired many people to consider small scale businesses.\nFrom taxis to pizzas to movie rentals \"So we see anything from a taxi business, to a pizza bakery, to a mechanic shop, to even DVD rentals\" as potential businesses,\" Rasevych said. (Slow internet connections in remote First Nations means demand for movie rentals remains high).\nWith unemployment rates of 80 to 90 per cent in some First Nations, small owner-operated businesses can make a big difference for families struggling to make ends meet, he said.\nCESO is confident its volunteers can make a meaningful difference during the three-year project.\n\"These are all highly experienced professionals from both the public and private sector,\" said CESO's chief executive officer, Wendy Harris. \"On average they have 25 years of experience in the field in which they're going to volunteer.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:16:27.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
