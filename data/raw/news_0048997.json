TCS has Rs 43,100 crore cash on its book, which is roughly 10 per cent of its market capitalisation. \n\n“The share buyback is proposed to be made from the shareholders of the company on a proportionate basis under the tender offer route using the stock exchange mechanism in accordance with the provisions contained in the SEBI (Buy Back of Securities) Regulations , 1998 and the Companies Act, 2013 and rules made thereunder,” the company said. \n\nThe buyback size does not include any expenses incurred or to be incurred for the buyback like filing fees, advisory fees, public announcement publication expenses, printing and dispatch expenses and other incidental and related expenses, the company said. \n\n“The buyback is subject to shareholder approval by way of a special resolution through postal ballot. The public announcement setting out the process, time lines and other requisite details will be released in due course in accordance with the buyback regulations,” the company said. \n\nThe company had last Thursday informed stock exchanges about the board meeting, which was held on Monday. \n\nReacting to the news, the company's shares rallied over 4 per cent to settle the day at Rs 2,506 on BSE.
