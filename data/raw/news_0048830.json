He picked me up at my hotel like a gentleman, then we came over here, he brought me a nice little gift and he enjoyed the game courtside,\" she said. \nThe tennis player, who is currently ranked 44th in the world, admitted that she was \"so lucky\" Mr Goehrke is \"normal\". \nBouchard, who has also reached the semi-finals of the Australian and French Opens, said she had been nervous before the first date. \n\"After all the media attention it got, it was something I could, first of all, not back out of. There was no chance,\" she said. \n\"I was worried, however, when I looked at his Twitter profile as soon as I lost the bet and his profile picture was a picture of Tiger Woods. I was like, 'It's one of those Twitter fans. I don't even know what he looks like. What is going to happen?' \n\"But it turns out he seems to be a very nice boy.\" \nThe student said it was \"amazing\" that Bouchard had agreed to the date. \n\"The most amazing part is that she agreed to it without knowing who I was,\" he explained. \n\"I thought maybe there was a chance she would respond, but I thought there was no chance she'd actually agree to it.\" \nIt is not the first time celebrities or sports stars have agreed to dates with strangers. Tupac Shakur took a teenager to her prom night after she wrote to him explaining her boyfriend had dumped her. \nIn 2011 a US marine made a YouTube video asking Mila Kunis to be his date to the Marine Corps ball - she agreed. \nAnd a Justin Bieber fan made a website asking him to be her date to her prom night. He replied saying his schedule was too packed to be able to make it - but made up for it by inviting her to be his 'plus one' at the Billboard awards. \nThe Telegraph, London", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:37:47.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
