Loads of people have lost everything,” she told the Daily Telegraph from London \nFire expert teams are heading to the region to assess the sheer scale of loss from the weekend’s blazes, as more than 80 bushfires continue to burn across the state.

Thanks to all our fire fighters, emergency services, media and community. Our thoughts are with all those that have suffered losses @NSWRFS https://t.co/hHX0stG31M — Shane Fitzsimmons (@RFSCommissioner) 12 February 2017 \nRural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said 25 fires were still uncontained this morning, after blazes burnt across “a very large area” consuming everything in their path. \nBut cooler temperatures on Monday, after Sunday’s catastrophic conditions, will help crews gain an upper hand. \n“We know there is clearly losses. Losses in homes, losses in buildings, losses in livestock and other agricultural assets,” he told the Nine Network. \n“The extraordinary effort of firefighters. What they saved yesterday will far outweigh the losses that we report today. I know that is cold comfort for those who have lost so much and I don’t mean any disrespect or being insensitive, but we cannot take away from the amount of property, people, livelihoods that have been saved under yesterday’s conditions.” A wall of smoke can be seen in the background between Merriwa and Cassilis in the central west.

Mr Fitzsimmons said critical backburning and patrol work will be undertaken in the coming days. The massive bushfire near Dunedoo in the state’s Central West has burned more than 40,000 hectares.
