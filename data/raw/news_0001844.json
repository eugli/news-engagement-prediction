Bernstein, Getty Images Trump update: UC faculty sends president warning on climate change 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nThousands of University of California faculty members are warning President Trump that deviating from the Paris Climate Agreement — as administration officials have recently hinted he might — would undermine the “future of our children and grandchildren.” \nMore than 2,300 faculty members throughout the UC system signed an open letter to Trump released Tuesday . The president has in the past called climate change a “hoax.” He once famously tweeted that climate change was “ created by and for the Chinese .” \nTrump’s administration has also scrubbed the White House website clean of mentions of climate change, and he and other Republican officials have argued that federal climate regulations have unnecessarily harmed U.S. businesses. \nIn the “most urgent terms possible,” the academics urged Trump to: \n•Meet the carbon emissions target underlined in the Paris Agreement signed by former President Barack Obama. \n•Ensure that America becomes the “global leader on climate action.” \nPresident Trump is expected to sign an executive order within days that will pull America out of the Paris agreement, which aims to combat climate change. The news was made public by Myron Ebell, a former climate change adviser to Donald Trump who took charge of the President’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) transition team. \"[The US would] clearly change its course on climate policy...[Mr. Trump is] pretty clear that the problem or the crisis has been overblown and overstated...He could do it by executive order tomorrow, or he could wait and do it as part of a larger package. There are multiple ways and I have no idea of the timing. Media: Wibbitz \n•Invest in clean energy and technologies that remove carbon gases from the atmosphere. \nIn a series of media op-eds and interview in his last weeks in office, Obama reaffirmed the importance of his policies on climate . He most notably penned an op-ed in Science Magazine that outlined his argument on how the U.S. economy would benefit from an investment in clean energy. \nGov. Jerry Brown has also promised that California will fight attempts by the Trump administration to roll back progress on climate change, even if the state has to launch its “own damn satellite” to track global warming. \nMichael Bodley is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
