Reuters Pop superstar Beyonce has said she and her husband, rap star and entrepreneur Jay Z, are expecting twins, sending social media into a meltdown. \n\"We would like to share our love and happiness,\" Beyonce, 35, posted on her Instagram page on Wednesday. \n\"We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes,\" she added. \nThe announcement came with a photo of the \"Crazy in Love\" singer stripped down to her lingerie, caressing a noticeable baby bump, and wearing a veil over her head. \nThe news became the top trending item on Twitter with more than 500,000 tweets in the first hour. \nThe birth of the couple's first baby, Blue Ivy, caused a paparazzi storm in 2012 with New York's Lenox Hill hospital shutting down part of its maternity wing to accommodate music's royal couple. \nBeyonce did not say when the twins were due to be born nor did she give any details about her pregnancy. \nThe news came less than a year after the release of Beyonce's album \"Lemonade,\" in which she appeared to address long-standing rumours of trouble in her eight-year marriage. \nThe lyrics of several songs spoke about being cheated on, and regretting being married. But Beyonce made clear in the final tracks of the album and in music videos featuring Jay-Z that she had decided to stay in the relationship. \nThe couple have never directly addressed the rumours. \nIt was not clear whether the pregnancy would affect plans for the Grammy Awards on Feb 10, where Beyonce has a leading nine nominations, mostly for \"Lemonade,\" and would be expected to perform. \nShe is also due to headline a concert at the Coachella music festival in southern California in April.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T12:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:46:20.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
