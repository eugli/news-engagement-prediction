Romney and his son Tagg are expected to bid around $25-30 million for each percentage point of the teams’ shares. \nThe Steinbrenner family owns the Yankees, which Forbes valued in 2016 at $3.4 billion — the highest of any Major League Baseball team. \nHeyman also reports the Romneys offer Florida Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria $1.4 billion for the club last year, but the sale never happened. \nRomney declared himself to be a Boston Red Sox fan during his time in Massachusetts. That didn’t stop him from investing in the Yankees in 2007 and pursuing a larger stake in the team 10 years later. \nBusiness trumps loyalty for some sports fans. \nThumbnail photo via Bob Donnan/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:47:40.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
