The deputy president said the opposition leaders are only interested in sharing political seats. He hit out at Kilifi Governor Amazon Kingi, saying he had failed to work with the Jubilee administration to develop the county. Advertisement More by this Author \nDeputy President William Ruto has dismissed the show of unity by leaders of the National Super Alliance (Nasa). \nThe deputy president has said the opposition chiefs only want to remove the Jubilee administration in order to get power but not to develop the country. \nAddressing a rally in Kaloleni, Kilifi County, on Wednesday, Mr Ruto said the opposition leaders are only interested in sharing political seats. \nHe said that unlike the Jubilee Party, which he said is keen on developing the country and had the interests of Kenyans at heart, Nasa is only keen on sharing positions. \n\"The difference between Jubilee and the opposition is as clear as day and night. While Jubilee is for [the] development of the country, our competitors are only good [at] empty rhetoric and organising demonstrations,\" he said. \nThe deputy president urged Coast residents to join Jubilee and re-elect its leaders during the August polls.
