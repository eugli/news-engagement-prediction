Lawton The Kilsheimer family has seen the sign industry go through major shifts in three generations. When Gunther Kilsheimer founded Art Display Co. in 1947, the process was tedious — all signs were created by hand. That process changed in 1990, when computer generation became more accessible. That’s when Doug Kilsheimer , Gunther’s son, and Arthur Goldberg , a longtime employee at the company, stepped in to lead the business. The Kilsheimer family includes, from left, Todd Rosenthal, Casey Kilsheimer, CEO Douglas… more Joanne S. Lawton Although Doug, now CEO, and Arthur, executive vice president, have embraced new technology like digital printing and energy-efficient LED lights, there’s much about the sign industry that hasn’t changed. That includes the need for tight-knit, long-lasting relationships with clients. Some of Art Display’s longest-running relationships include Charles E. Smith Cos., which became part of Vornado Realty Trust , and Bethesda-based Miller & Long. “Everyone grew together,” Doug said. “It’s a growing town, but still a small town. Personal relationships are key.” Now, visitors can see the company’s work adorning and illuminating National Harbor and Circa’s Foggy Bottom location. In Baltimore, Art Display was contracted to install the 12-foot-plus lettering crowning Legg Mason’s headquarters. Doug attributes much of Art Display’s success to its employees, many of whom have been working with the company for decades. “You really can’t go to school and learn how to make signs,” he said. “We have people here who retire after 40, 45 years.” That success has also led to growth. The company has doubled in size since it moved its headquarters to Capitol Heights more than a decade ago. As the company continues to grow, the next generation of Kilsheimers are taking key roles, including Doug’s daughter and son, Project Manager Casey Kilsheimer and Director of Purchasing Brandon Kilsheimer , respectively. In addition, son-in-law Todd Rosenthal acts as director of communications. That bodes well for keeping the family’s ownership of the company, Doug said. Although he said there’s more competition than ever in the sign industry in the D.C. area, he said the company’s commitment to its clients and to making sure that all aspects of its business are running smoothly, from manufacturing to project management to sales, sets it apart. “If one piece of this falls apart, the whole system falls apart,” Doug said. “There are a lot of pieces that have to fall into place.” A closer look Description: Sign manufacturing, construction and installation company Revenue: $18 million", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:09:16.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
