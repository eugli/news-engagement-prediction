Alessia added, “ Zedd was really hands on and made sure I was involved in every part of the process.” \n“I think this song is right in the middle between where Alessia is musically and where I am and that’s what’s so exciting about it,” Zedd continued. “I’ve been trying to knock down barriers around music genres and this is another step for me to walk towards a musical future where I can create any genre I want without people putting me in a box.” \nAlessia said, “It still feels like me, just an elevated pop sound. I don’t know that I would be in this bold on my own stuff so it’s cool to try these things with collaborators.” \nCheck out the song on iTunes right here! \nClick inside to read the lyrics to “Stay”….
