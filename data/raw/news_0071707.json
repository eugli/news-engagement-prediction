One pair even replied in a condescending tone of \"I hope God will make you become a believer\" after being told I'm not interested. \nNothing you say will make me change my beliefs. Why not move on upon receiving the first \"no\"? Do you know how offensive it is for you to impose your religion randomly on others even after getting rejected several times?
