Relationships between staff, parents and governors are said to have become ‘toxic’ since Michelle Brindle took over Bollin Primary School in Bowdon, Cheshire. The row reached a head this week when teachers staged a strike. Around 70 parents also protested outside the school. Problems are said to have begun when Mrs Brindle paid for a mock Ofsted inspection. It led to new rules being brought in which teachers say greatly increased their workload. Children reported seeing teachers crying in corridors, and a long-serving member of staff was allegedly suspended. Fourteen teachers and two assistants lodged grievances with the governing body, which are so far unresolved. Eight governors also resigned. Worried parents then set up a WhatsApp online messaging group to discuss what was going on at the school, which was rated ‘outstanding’ in 2007. But when Mrs Brindle, 40, heard they were talking over the internet, she sent letters to the parents of all 450 pupils, warning she would sue if her reputation was harmed. Parents held a protest outside the school this week, complaining about Mrs Brindle's leadership The headteacher has been likened to Miss Trunchbull, from Roald Dahl book Matilda She wrote: ‘A number of social media posts have been made which are damaging to the reputation of the head and the school. Some are potentially libellous and leave individuals vulnerable to legal action.’ Businessman Howard Morris spoke to the Mail after hearing about problems at Bollin. He claimed his wife, Caroline, was driven out of her job as deputy head of Mrs Brindle’s previous school, Golborne St Thomas, in Wigan, by her ‘bullying’ style. He compared Mrs Brindle to Roald Dahl’s Miss Trunchbull, who terrorises the school in Matilda. ‘She is threatening and a bully – she’s almost like Miss Trunchbull,’ he said. Sinead Barry, 45, who has two daughters at the school, said issues began within weeks of Mrs Brindle’s arrival. She said: ‘Children were coming home saying teachers were crying.’ Kate Mazzag, 44, has taken her daughter out of school after a teacher was allegedly suspended. She said: ‘When we asked questions we were told not to say she was suspended, but “absent”.’ Erin Cherneski, 41, whose son is at the school, says Mrs Brindle has made a ‘toxic atmosphere’. On Thursday, 17 of Bollin’s 21 teachers walked out in protest. By yesterday 889 people had signed a ‘no confidence’ petition and Trafford Council last week issued a warning about the way the school is run. Peter Middleman, from the National Union of Teachers, said members had met with the head, but reached no compromise. Last night Mrs Brindle said: ‘I am 100 per cent committed to the school, and astounded at the behaviour of a small group of vocal parents.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:44:40.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
