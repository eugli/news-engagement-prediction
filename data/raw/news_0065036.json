Yes, mate, that’s about it. Although everyone gets the right of reply – they just don’t get the right for me to not reply to their reply – and you have overlooked how much time I also spend laughing, particularly when I think of you, each morning, fretfully scouring the column for any reference to West Ham. You missed two on Monday, by the way. Gianfranco Zola (ex-West Ham manager) and Rio Ferdinand (ex-West Ham player). You’re slipping, Jon; or maybe your infatuation is waning. It’s got to get boring after a while. Also, I put a lot more thought into the music than you think. There’s all sorts of layers at work although, I admit, some inferences are more obvious. Five points up next. Point one: about foreign referees in the Premier League A Spanish referee would give too many penalties in the Premier League, an English ref would be criticised in La Liga for not giving them. Balotellitubbie, Mechelen. I think referees feel that they have to abide by pundit law. Ex-footballers who often don't know the nuances of the laws decree what is right and wrong and the referees are hung out to dry. They will use claims about two footed or reckless tackles as evidence a red card should be awarded. The laws say no such thing, referring only to excessive force. ‘There was contact, so it's a penalty’ is more nonsense. Our game can never be refereed properly at the top level whilst the officials don't have a big enough voice. Mancsaint, Fareham. So, English teams, managed by non-English managers, played for by non-English players, owned by non-English owners, cheered on by non-English fans, can't have non-English referees? Whatever you say, Precious, whatever you say. A Gentleman Poster, Kansas. So, Mr Little Englander, where is the evidence for your story? Such nonsense - foreign referees could bring a wealth of experience to the Premier League, or they could flop – their nationality has nothing to do with it. Theusednation, Manchester. I don’t think two people have ever missed the point as much as this last pair. The column concerned the idea that foreign referees could provide very adequate replacements if English football did suffer a brain drain, in the light of Mark Clattenburg’s departure to Saudi Arabia. The conclusion, however, was that our game is insular and would not take kindly to outsiders enforcing some of the rules we find inconvenient. We wouldn’t want our blood-and-thunder battles touched. So it took the opposite of the small-minded, Little Englander, or precious stance. Anyway, back to those who comprehend. I think the presence of referees in the pages of newspapers – such as my colleague Graham Poll – or on television, like Howard Webb, is giving us greater insight into how the rules are interpreted by officials. I agree, Manc, our understanding and the reality can be different. Equally, I do think two-footed challenges or recklessness are covered by the phrase excessive force, and both could be worthy of red cards. I included the first comment because of its irony. Manchester City fans will not feel Spanish referees give too many penalties after Tuesday night’s travesty involving Sergio Aguero. Point two: about the Arsenal manager, and not just the current one I think under the modern qualification rules, George Graham would have won at least one Champions League. Moreover, he galvanised Arsenal into becoming a serious force and a trophy-winning team, after eight years without silverware. It’s odd that he's overlooked as one of the great Arsenal managers, just because of the bung scandal. WOZ69, Liverpool. Funny how the other week you leapt to the defence of Claudio Ranieri, hailing him a genius, and now this week, Arsene Wenger, a true genius, a game changer and a manager widely regarded as one of the best isn’t afforded the same courtesy. I think it borders on sadism how some of the established journalists have behaved towards a man we probably won’t see the likes of again. The loyalty he has shown Arsenal over the years is a rarity. He could probably still walk into most of the top jobs in Europe, and could probably have done so in the past had it not been for his love of the club. The style of play he has implemented over the years has forced others to adopt the same or a slightly different approach, and made others rethink the game. It wasn’t even two seasons ago that he won the FA Cup and to be consistently in the top four with the budget he has, is what you should be highlighting. Iheartfootball, Manchester. Who is Martin Samuel to criticise and disrespect the greatest manager in football history? Wenger revolutionised the game and is responsible for bringing skill to its modern form. He is the only manager to take a team through an entire season unbeaten. And he made Arsenal into one of the best-run clubs in the world with one of the finest stadiums in the world, and financially secure, unlike other clubs that are hugely in debt, or, reliant on sugar daddies. Itzhak Stern, United Kingdom. Arsene Wenger (2nd left) isn't sitting quite as comfortably as he has been during his reign All of which was acknowledged in my piece about Arsenal last week, after the 5-1 defeat in Munich, save for him being solely responsible for bringing skill to the modern game, which might have come as a surprise to the Ajax team of the 1970s, the country of Brazil, Diego Maradona, Barcelona or Sir Alex Ferguson. There was a bloke called Finney who could do a bit I’m told, too – and another called Best – although if football has engaged you for 20 years or so, yes, you probably think Wenger invented it. As for Wenger’s loyalty, while admirable, do you not also think it might be because other clubs would not let him have the control he enjoys at Arsenal, and would not be so indulgent of failure? Do you think a manager could go more than a decade at Barcelona or Real Madrid, even Manchester United and Chelsea, without winning the league? Wenger has been brilliant for Arsenal, but they have also been brilliant for him – every bit as steadfast through the lean years, every bit as strong and supportive of his methods. As for the boast about successive Champions League appearances, as I wrote in Monday’s column , that is also very much a product of the modern age. Had Wenger lived by the qualification rules that governed his predecessors, he would have played nearer 12 European Cup matches, rather than 190 via the Champions League. This is not to decry the achievement - I’d hate to be accused of sadism again – merely to point out that Wenger’s record is very much of the times. As for George Graham starting it all, I agree. Wenger’s early triumphs were still achieved with the remnants of Graham’s defensive personnel and philosophy, but I don’t think he would have won the Champions League. In 1991-92, his Arsenal team were outplayed and eliminated by Benfica in the second round, 4-2 on aggregate, and in 1989-90 when Arsenal were part of the English club ban the competition was won by Arrigo Sacchi’s AC Milan team. Maldini, Baresi, Ancelotti, Rijkaard, Van Basten, Gullit – Arsenal weren’t better than that. Diego Maradona knew a thing or two about playing the game - before Wenger came along Point three: a rare request granted Still waiting for Martin to discuss the effect of West Ham moving less than a mile from Leyton Orient. This broke Premier League rules and will obviously have a long term, detrimental effect on the club. I fear that if they lose league status Orient will just wither and die. He doesn't care about that, but many do. Orient have won the same amount as West Ham for the last 40 years: nothing. Why is this being allowed to happen with not a word said? Footydad1, United Kingdom. Well, wait no longer, Footydad – discuss it, we will. You’re talking rubbish, I’m afraid. Orient’s predicament – which I covered in a recent column , and in several smaller items through the last two seasons – is nothing to do with West Ham’s move, and everything to do with the appalling owners. They took a squad they had achieved Orient’s best league finish in 32 years and turned it to one whose Football League status is now seriously threatened after 112 years. It wasn’t as if West Ham were 100 miles away and now they are on the doorstep; they were always the biggest club in east London, Orient were always in their shadow. That didn’t matter, because Orient had their loyalists and their niche following. The problem will come if Orient drop into non-League when the tickets available at the London Stadium may hold more appeal than an away match in North Ferriby. But that isn’t West Ham’s fault. That is down to Orient’s owner. Also, West Ham won the FA Cup in 1980 – maths isn’t my strong point, but that’s definitely within 40 years of 2017. I hope your offspring aren’t home schooled, Dad. Point four: about media treatment of managers At this time each year, the conjecture cartel spend time with Arsene Wenger and Arsenal. Next week, they will move on to another manager. Not Jose Mourinho this time round, he’s doing OK – maybe Claudio Ranieri, maybe Slaven Bilic, David Moyes, Mauricio Pochettino. They will advise that something needs to be done, that things can’t go on like this. Some will say they’re not in the business of getting managers the sack. But they are complicit. The wound festers and worsens until lanced or drained. It is down to Arsenal’s level-headed approach that the Wenger witch hunt remains just that. Then, at some other point in the season, the same cartel will wax lyrical about Arsenal being a feast for tired eyes. Last season, despite other teams dropping off, it was Arsenal that received most criticism for failing to grasp the opportunity. Mr Bannister, London. This would be a more accurate appraisal of my stance on the managers you mention if I hadn’t this season defended Ranieri at every opportunity and supported Bilic against Dimitri Payet. I’ve also spoken in favour of just about every other manager you list, not least Moyes at Manchester United and Mourinho last season. As far as the rest of it goes, I agree. I have said on many occasions – and it is a running joke on the Sunday Supplement – that every result turns into a referendum at Arsenal, which is ridiculous. Coincidentally, I was only remarking when discussing Ranieri with a Leicester fan the other day – OK, it was Gary Lineker – that in what would now be termed the good old days, a manager could take a club down, and get the chance to bring them back up. John Lyall did it at West Ham and it never occurred to us, as fans, that he should have been sacked for going down. He was a good manager, he merited another chance. That’s how I feel about Ranieri. Even if Leicester went down, who is out there who more deserves the chance to win promotion? Burnley are now reaping the reward of recognising the talent in Sean Dyche and standing by him. Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri is in the spotlight for very different reasons this season Point five: You knew it was coming...Piegate Profiting from a bet is a gambling issue, so take appropriate action by all means. But I suspect Wayne Shaw didn’t have any idea about that. He was just playing along with the same sense of fun that we all were. It’s hardly a betting conspiracy. Sporting integrity? Damaging the occasion? Come on, the bloke is 45 and well over 20 stone. You can rent out Sutton’s plastic pitch on the same day as they play their games. The manager vapes on the touchline, another player eats his pre-match meal at McDonald's and claims he’s never had a salad in his life. It is pub team stuff, isn’t it, and we all lapped it all up beforehand. The game, the result and the sense of occasion was unaffected on the night. Adam10, Derby. Shaw was in a lose-lose here. If he ate the pie he’s fixing it for the gamblers, but if he didn’t eat the pie he's fixing it for Sun Bet. So whatever he did the guy couldn't win. Tifa Lockheart, United Kingdom. There are two elements: the goalkeeper had to eat the pie and the BBC had to broadcast it. Why are the BBC not being investigated, as they could have simply kept their cameras focussed on the pitch? Coldblowlane, Bromley. Wayne Shaw's pie turned out to be a costly one at Gander Green Lane on Monday night This article is laughable. This man eating a pie was funny, entertaining and relatable. Things like this keep a smile on our face. This is now ruining football. Overpaid players with massive egos, stewards over-policing fans, getting them to sit down and not use certain words. Extortionate fees to go and watch a game or have Sky Sports have all made it worse. This banter is great for the game – jog on PC police, you're not wanted. Peregrine Smythe Pye, United Kingdom. They put this bet up as a loss leader to attract people to open accounts and to get publicity. He ate the pie for a bit of banter. So his mates made a few quid, so what? It's not like they offered 100/1 he would score an own goal and he came on as substitute and threw the ball in his own net. Dave, Sunderland. If everyone had just laughed it off then it would have become part of a great spectacle, Arsenal nearly beaten at Sutton. But oh no, we can’t have the little man getting one over on the greedy bookies can we? Leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Lennon83, Monmouthshire. This whole issue is ridiculous. A man has lost his job over the most stupid thing, hounded out by the press who need their pound of flesh for the week. Who cares how small the incident they just need someone, anyone, to take down to sell a few newspapers with no consideration for the people involved. Who will it be next round – a tea lady at Lincoln who offered Arsenal the wrong biscuits? Ledley King, London. I don’t know – maybe Sun Bets could offer 8/1 that she’s tips a cup of coffee into Arsene Wenger’s lap? Don’t worry it’s only a bit of banter. I feel sorry for some of the folk on here, really I do. Imagine being so starved of mirth in your life that you think a fat bloke eating a pie constitutes humour. There are proper comedians out there, you know. Really funny people. Maybe try to widen your circle of friends, too. There’s more to a gag than pie-eating. You see, at first I thought what had happened was funny. The Arsenal fans were singing, ‘Give us a wave, and we’ll buy you a pie.’ First, he gave them a wave. Next moment, he was eating a pie. I thought someone had got one to him. Good gag. But it wasn’t a gag. It was a betting scam – and the Gambling Commission is investigating because, clearly, they suspect the bookies were in on it. That is the point being missed. There was nothing spontaneous or innocent about it. It was a cold-eyed publicity coup in which Sun Bets got to control Sutton’s reserve goalkeeper for the day. He said he got the pie at half-time. It was 1-0 to Arsenal then, and he could still have been used as a substitute. Shouldn’t he have been in the dressing-room, rather than scouting the club bar for a prop for his stunt? So let’s not pretend that it had no chance of influencing the game. As for the BBC cameraman and producer, they were simply hoodwinked. Shaw stepped out from the dug-out, very ostentatiously, to eat the pie and they were obviously unaware of the meaning and went with the colour again. Unless you follow daft betting markets you wouldn’t have known the significance. I didn’t at first; but as soon as I was told there was a bet available I understood the ramifications. And I wasn’t alone. The FA were already aware on Monday night. I also see a lot of people parroting Piers Morgan’s argument that Shaw was damned even if he didn’t eat the pie. No he wasn’t, because to not eat a pie would constitute normal behaviour. Let’s say Sun Bets make a market that the next time Wayne Rooney scores he produces a pair of chopsticks from his Y-fronts and pretends to eat a Chinese takeway. He has never done that before. So if he didn’t do it, his behaviour wouldn’t be considered collusion in any bet. He would just be behaving as normal. So if it wasn’t normal for Shaw to eat a pie, if he didn’t eat a pie, where’s the problem? It’s not his responsibility to ensure a bet comes in – he took the decision to make it so, and we can only speculate why. And Lennon – the little man didn’t get one over on the greedy bookies, if the bookies turn out to be complicit. Do you understand? It was their market, they created it, for whatever motive. And while he didn’t throw the ball in his net, Dave, don’t you see where this leads? It’s the thin end of the spot-fix wedge. And funnily enough, when the News of the World – owned by the same folk who brought you Sun Bets – uncovered irregular behaviour in the Pakistan cricket team, they seemed very happy with the resulting prison sentences. Now they’re the enablers. Fail to recognise that and you’re gullible. Until next time. Here, have a song.
