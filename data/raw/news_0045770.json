United Voice has not been consulted about any changes either. \n\"If it is the case, it is a sad reflection on multinational corporations and the distain they've shown for their workers.\" \nThe company has been contacted for comment. \nThe South Australian Government said it had also contacted the company to find out about tomorrow's meeting, but had not had a response. \nIt said it will make sure it provides whatever support is needed for workers.
