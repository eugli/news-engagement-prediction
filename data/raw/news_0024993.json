Within hours, hundreds of farmers, tourists and teenagers were racing to keep the surviving 140 or so whales alive in one of the worst whale strandings in the nation’s history. \nMs. Morrison, a magazine writer and editor, stumbled upon the whales after taking a pre-dawn trip with a photographer and a guide to capture the red glow of the sunrise. \nThe young ones were crying \n“You could hear the sounds of splashing, of blow-holes being cleared, of sighing,” she said. “The young ones were the worst. Crying is the only way to describe it.” \nThe adult and baby whale carcasses were strewn three or four deep in places for hundreds of yards, often rolled over on the sand with their tail fins still aloft. \nMs. Morrison’s group alerted authorities, and volunteers soon began arriving in wetsuits and carrying buckets. Dressed in her jeans and sand shoes, she waded into the water and did what she could to try to manoeuvre the surviving whales upright so they could breathe more easily. \n“I walked away crying my eyes out,” she said. “We knew there were limited things we could do.” \nVolunteer rescue group Project Jonah said a total of 416 whales had stranded. When high tide came, volunteers managed to refloat about 50 the surviving whales while the other 80 or 90 remained beached. \nHuman chain in the water \nThe volunteers then formed a human chain in the water to try to stop the creatures from swimming back and stranding themselves again. It will likely take a day or so to determine how successful their efforts have been. \nVolunteers plan to refloat more whales on Saturday. \nFarewell Spit, a sliver of sand that arches like a hook into the Tasman Sea, seems to confuse whales and has been the site of previous mass strandings. \nThe Department of Conservation said about 500 volunteers had joined conservation workers on the beach. \nCommunity ranger Kath Inwood said the volunteers were continuing to keep the stranded survivors damp and cool by placing blankets over them and dousing them with buckets of water. \nThe high tide allowed volunteers their one shot of the day to help some of the whales. Many plan to return for the high tide on Saturday to try to refloat more of the whales, including any that strand themselves again. \nJust why whales do it? \nThere are different theories as to why whales strand themselves, from them chasing prey too far inshore to them trying to protect a sick member of the group. \nThe community ranger said whale strandings occur most years at Farewell Spit, but the scale of this event came as a shock. \nSometimes described as a whale trap, the spit’s long coastline and gently sloping beaches seem to make it difficult for whales to navigate away from once they get close. \nThe beach is remote. Getting there from the nearest provincial airport in Nelson takes a three-hour drive followed by a 15-minute hike. \nConservation workers said many of the surviving whales were likely to be in bad shape given the number of deaths, and that their conditions would likely deteriorate the longer they remained stranded. \nKiwi’s dubious record \nNew Zealand has one of the highest rates of whale strandings in the world, and Friday’s event is the nation’s third-biggest recorded stranding. \nThe largest was in 1918, when about 1,000 pilot whales came ashore on the Chatham Islands. In 1985, about 450 whales stranded in Auckland. \n“It was just heartbreaking,” Ms. Morrison said. “Utterly heartbreaking.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T12:07:28.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
