Sport builds character and instils belief. The can-do spirit that sport imparts is an essential ingredient in career building and therefore it is important that every child realizes the need to play.\nMore so in this automated world of sedentary lifestyles that lead to lifestyle disorders. Fateh Hyderabad AFC , a team that plays 2nd Division Football in I-League , has realized the importance of a minimum 60 minutes of physical activity in every child's life, daily. Their joint venture with UK's Premier Education Group (PEG) to launch Sports and Performing Arts Programme in India, which was unveiled in Hyderabad on Wednesday, is an effort to this end.\nPEG is the largest scholastic physical education provider in UK and delivers physical education in sports, health and performing arts programmes for children of all ages. PEG will provide technology, systems, personnel and various other expertise to Fateh Hyderabad.\nPEG employs over 1,000 qualified professionals and last year their activities received over 9 million visits. PEG is UK's leading sports-coaching and education brand with 84 franchisees and 1,000 coaches and tutors around the UK.\n\"Premier Education Group is the leading provider of various physical education programmes in schools in the UK and has been expanding its footprint internationally. We are thrilled that they have chosen to partner with Fateh Hyderabad to commence their India journey,\" said Yogesh Maurya, Technical and Sporting Director of Fateh Hyderabad. \"Improving grassroots opportunities for boys and girls across sports is central to our football club's plans and PEG is the perfect partner to help us make a larger impact across the Hyderabad community,\" he added.\n\"We found great synergy in Fateh Hyderabad, which is building a strong grassroots eco-system in this city and in India, said David Batch, CEO of PEG. \"We deliver over 25,000 events a month to schools, children and parents with innovative programmes and have been doing this since 1999. We are confident we will be able to strengthen the grassroots sports and performing arts eco-system with early age talent discovery, development of their flair as well as exploit the potential that exists in India,\" he added.\nDavid was the youngest UEFA 'A' level qualified coach in the world when he was just 20-year-old.\nThe partnership entails the organisations create activities in different sites that have a meaningful, measurable impact, which includes helping grassroots talent development and improving physical and mental health of children from pre-school to higher education groups.\nFateh Hyderabad has engaged schools on an outsource model for their activity programmes. These are conducted on a daily basis, after and before school, and on weekends, including summer camp offerings.\n\"We want to give as many children as we can an opportunity to get physically active and learn about health,\" Yogesh explained about the result-oriented everyday PEG programme. \"We will talk about this in classrooms, community clubs, sports halls and boardrooms.\"\nThe preparation to introduce PEG programmes in schools for activities like cricket, badminton, cycling, basketball, football, gymnastics, hockey, dance, drama, and performing activities are already underway. The programme will be on a chargeable basis and is also working with benefactors to expand the programme to government schools.\n\" Arsenal player Jack Wilshere was a part of our UK programme in the under-7 group. Whether children go on to excel, like Wilshere does, is totally for them. But they have every right to enjoy sport. Our mission is not to unearth the next superstar in sport, but to engage and give children a start,\" Batch explained.\n\"We have realized that a child specializing in a sport when very young is not good for the player. Our programme, which is multi-sport, multi-skill gives them an opportunity to try their hand at different avenues before they make up their mind. Our educators were recently invited by the Manchester United to address their U-13s because we're not just football,\" said Batch.\nDaniel Melling, a resource person with PEG, was excited by the prospects on offer. \"We went to a school in the morning, where we taught them different techniques of running. The kids were shy to start with, but by the time we finished they were helping each other, comparing techniques and trying to get better. If one session of activity can make them so competitive, I'm sure it'll help them do well in academics too, apart from impacting their health positively,\" he said.\n\"This programme is a blueprint for life, for kids and the development of the club, fans, parents and educators. All of them are impacted and is a great model for all centres in India,\" Yogesh said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:30:59.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
