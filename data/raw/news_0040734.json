Footage aired on state media showed him grim-faced, reported South Korea's Yonhap news agency, and he did not wave when he left, as is customary. No request from North Korea \nSelangor Police Chief Abdul Samah Mat told the BBC the examination of Mr Kim's body was completed on Wednesday evening, but there has been no indication of whether the results will be made public. Image copyright Reuters Image caption North Korean embassy vehicles were seen leaving the Kuala Lumpur hospital late on Wednesday \nReports on Wednesday said North Korea had asked to claim the body, but Mr Samah said that while officials from the embassy did visit the hospital they had not officially asked to remove the body. \nHe said Malaysia had no objection in principle to releasing the body to North Korea, if such a request were made. Woman due in court \nMr Kim is believed to have been attacked by two women, using some form of chemical.

He spent most of his time overseas in Macau, mainland China and Singapore. \nHe had spoken out in the past against his family's dynastic control of North Korea and in a 2012 book was quoted as saying he believed his younger half-brother lacked leadership qualities. \nBut he had said he was not interested in assuming the leadership himself. \nUnnamed US government sources have said they believe he was poisoned by North Korean agents. \nSouth Korean spy chief Lee Byung-ho told South Korean MPs that Pyongyang had wanted to kill Kim Jong-nam for several years, but that he was being protected by China. \nBut some analysts question what motive Kim Jong-un would have to kill his estranged half-brother, given the risk of the operation and possibilities for embarrassment, added to the fact that he was not seen as a threat to Mr Kim's leadership. \nStill, Mr Kim was reportedly targeted for assassination in the past. A North Korean spy jailed by South Korea in 2012 is said to have admitted trying to organise a hit-and-run accident targeting him. \nThe secretive state has a long history of sending agents overseas to carry out assassinations, attacks and kidnappings.
