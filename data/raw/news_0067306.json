You know when this would be appropriate? After your friend got their wisdom teeth taken out, not after they've had an abortion. How offensive to think a comedy would be a good antidote for the pain your friend might be feeling.\" \nAutumn was particularly disgusted at the language used in the magazine's second gift idea â€” period panties. \n\"These revolutionary panties allow you to free-bleed like our fore-mothers wished they could. Technically they are made for your period, but that's no reason not to rock em for post-abortion woes, especially because there will be blood,\" the article states. \n\"Do I even need to explain why this is so deplorable?\" Autumn asked. \"The language and flippant tone is appalling! Who would even consider 'rocking' underwear after experiencing an abortion? Yes, there will be blood because that's what happens after a pregnancy ends and it's traumatizing. And cool underwear won't fix it or make it all better.\" \nFurther lambasting the \"GRL PWR\" hat gift idea, Autumn posed, \"Is this really the time for that?\" \n\"I just ended my baby's life. Girl power! Are they insinuating that girls that celebrate their abortions understand girl power more than girls who regret them or refuse to have them? And by the way, how many aborted babies have been girls? What about their rights? When do girls begin to have power? And how powerful do you have to be to destroy the most helpless of people? To me, abortion seems like the opposite of girl power. It is the most invasive and degrading thing that could happen to a girl. \n\"This is a human rights issue, not a girl power movement.\" \nThe pro-life student activist said that articles like the one from Teen Vogue contribute to the acceptance of abortion by some sections of society. \n\"No wonder our culture has become so desensitized at the idea of taking the life of a baby,\" she lamented. \nAutumn insisted that teens who have had an abortion need a friend to talk to, to pray for them, and to take their pain seriously. \n\"I want them to know that there are organizations out there that will help them where they are at,\" she stressed. \nStudents for Life praised Autumn's response, and said that Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortions provider, should be \"terrified\" of the pro-life generation. \nThe group described the young pro-life generation as \"a generation that cares deeply about human rights and equality of all people, which extends to the preborn. A generation that has successfully incorporated the mission to help women facing unplanned pregnancies into the mainstream pro-life movement through the Pregnant on Campus Initiative. A generation that is truly fearless in the face of Planned Parenthood and their allies.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:51:50.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
