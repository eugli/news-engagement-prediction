Think about a \"Charles Oakley Night\" at the Garden, as Jeff Van Gundy suggested Friday. \nInstead, Dolan banned Oakley from the Garden. \nInstead, he accused Oakley of having anger management issues. \nInstead, he suggested Oakley may be an alcoholic. \nInstead, he said Oakley was shouting things with \"racial and sexual overtones.\" \nInstead, Dolan opened himself up to defamation lawsuit. \nInstead, he gave an interview that felt like an extended Donald Trump tweet with its bullying. \nIn the backwards world of MSG, Phil Jackson, the man with a 71-147 record as an executive, is allowed to stay for as long as he wants. That's according to Dolan. But Oakley, the All-Star power forward who helped the Knicks win 70 playoff games and advance to the NBA Finals, isn't allowed in the building. In the same interview, Dolan, while reading off a paper as if to ensure he got to all the insults, said he wants to help Oakley with his issues but doesn't want him around. This was after Dolan targeted a different scapegoat by firing the Garden's head of security. \nDolan thinks everybody else is the problem, unless it's untouchable Phil. \n\"To me, I think that Charles has got a problem. I've said this before. We've said this before. We said it one time that he's his own worst problem. He has a problem,\" Dolan said. \"People need to sort of understand that. He has a problem with anger. He's both physically and verbally abusive. He may have a problem with alcohol, we don't know. But those behaviors of being physically and verbally abusive, those are personality problems.\" \nIf none of this makes any sense, it's because very little of Dolan's Knicks seems logical. All-time greats have come to Dolan's Garden and plummeted spectacularly, like Jackson, Isiah Thomas and Larry Brown. \nAnd maybe Dolan felt entitled to announce on radio that Oakley, \"may have a problem with alcohol,\" because Dolan himself is a recovering alcoholic. \nBut it was classless. It was insulting. It was completely unbecoming of an NBA owner. \nDolan would've been welcomed by the public if he spoke about fixing all of Jackson's mistakes. Instead, he granted Jackson immunity and assassinated Oakley's character. \n\"I do think that Charles needs help,\" Dolan said. \"He can't want to have the things that have happened to him, particularly since he retired as a player, they aren't good. He has had many physical altercations, right. He has been arrested. He's had a lot of trouble. And it all seems to stem from his anger. That can't be something that he intended to have happen. Maybe he doesn't remember it. I think he is somewhat in denial.\" \n\"Very disrespectful and insulting,\" Oakley's representative and friend Akhtar Farzaie responded to the News. \"Deliberately made up outrageous false accusation of a beloved Knick/NBA legend and more importantly a great all-around person.\" \nProminent New York civil rights attorney Earl Ward, who represented former Mets trainer Brian McNamee, told the News that Oakley has a libel case against Dolan. So this probably isn't over. Unfortunately, we heard the Nets don't have any intention of bringing Oakley to the Barclays Center to stick it to their neighbor. \n\"Those comments rise to the level of defamation,\" Earl said. \"You're saying you don't know (if Oakley has alcohol problem), it still raises the idea that he's an alcoholic. It is defamatory. It's a strong statement to make. You don't know where it's coming from. If you're going to go and say that, you better have the support to back it up. It is a defamatory statement.\" \nIf for no other reason, you'd think the Knicks would want to squash this situation because it stains their reputation with players and free agents. As one longtime NBA executive told the News: \"They were already wary of playing for Dolan. But this stuff with Oakley takes it to another level.\" The same executive said that Dolan was a big reason Kevin Durant never considered coming to New York this summer. \nAnd that was before the franchise managed to alienate its current star (Carmelo Anthony) and former star (Oakley) in a span of 24 hours. \nAt one point during the interview, Dolan made some sense when he said that he passed off all responsibility to Jackson because, \"I recognized some three-plus years ago that running a basketball operation is not my skillset.\" \nGood to hear that there's some humility remaining in the Garden. But the Oakley stuff was just vindictive nonsense. \nDolan said that Oakley is banned because, \"the number one concern always has to be the safety and the comfort of the fans.\" So please explain why these same fans were chanting his name. \nDolan said Oakley arrived at the Garden on a \"mission\" and with an \"agenda.\" He said of the former power forward, that \"from the moment he stepped into the Garden, and I mean the moment he walked through the first set of doors, he began with this behavior -- abusive behavior, disrespectful behavior.\" So please explain why the only evidence the Knicks provided was testimony from Garden employees and a video of Oakley sitting down until approached by security. \nIt felt like the continuation of a dirty smear campaign lobbied against a beloved Knick.
