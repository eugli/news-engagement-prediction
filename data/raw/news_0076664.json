One thing we can be sure of – this year’s Oscars belongs to one and only La La Land. The musical romantic drama is most likely to get away with most of the awards, especially some of the major ones here. But apart from La La Land, most of the other movies nominated for the major categories are something we call as Oscar bait – moving human dramas with some heartfelt performances and heart-wrenching moments that you can only watch once. \nWhile some of the best entertaining movies have been ignored by the jury this year, most hurtful snubs being Deadpool, 20th Century Woman, Sully, Captain America: Civil War. However, there is no point in crying over spilled milk, so instead let’s look at who is going to win among the chosen ones.
