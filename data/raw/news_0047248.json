But Donald Trump supporters were on hand as well being just as vocal. \nAnd that opened the door to some spirited exchanges: \n“You have a few isolated people here. So he spoke a bout stopping illegal… He’s not the voice of immigrants.. He’s the voice of legal immigrants… We’re all the voice o f legal immigrants.” \nDespite what the calendar said, for many this was a ‘Not My President’s Day’ and many here say they will raise their voices each and every day to voice their displeasure. \nIn New York City, Gurnal Scott, FOX News.
