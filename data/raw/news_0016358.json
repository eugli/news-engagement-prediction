Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nShe had absolutely EVERYONE talking during the latest series of Celebrity Big Brother thanks to her fiery personality and penchant for rowing, so it’s no surprise Kim Woodburn could get very own TV show. \nThe 74-year-old - who first found fame on How Clean Is Your House? - has reportedly been in talks with telly bosses about fronting a chat show or recording her own reality series. \n“A number of channels are interested and she’s having talks this week,” a source told The Sun .

She would be the perfect host of her own chat show as she’s not afraid to say exactly what she thinks.” \nNo doubt the sudden interest has come as a surprise to Kim, who admitted just yesterday her days on TV were probably numbered given her age. \nDuring an explosive interview with Phillip Schofield on This Morning, the outspoken star had told him: “I’m 74 years old. You have a long time left to work on TV, if I never got another TV show I couldn’t give a toss.” \nFans of Kim will be thrilled by the news as many spoke out during CBB to urge a TV channel to give the star her own show. \nOne wrote: “Kim is TV gold. Needs her own show. She’s hilarious!” \nAnother said: \"Kim needs a talk show. Jeremy Kyle style. IMAGINE IT.\" \nKim hasn’t commented on the rumours so far, but she did take to Twitter overnight to defend her much talked about interview on This Morning. She hit the headlines after the frosty chat with Phillip Schofield, which ended with her branding him a “phoney”. \nShe tweeted: “I’m a nice person. Anybody I know will tell you this. If somebody pushes my buttons. I push back just as hard.” \nSeveral viewers were left cringing in disbelief after the chat descended into a row between Kim and Phillip while Holly Willoughby sat silently and tried not to giggle. \nReacting on Twitter, one viewer wrote: “This has got to be the most awkward interview I've ever witnessed on #thismorning my lord!” \nAnother said: “Kim Woodburn vs Philip Schofield on @thismorning right now.. so awkward to watch but so funny.” \nA third added: \"THE MOST uncomfortable tv interview EVER!!!\" Kim's interview with This Morning had everyone talking (Photo: Rex Features) Video Loading  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:05:21.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
