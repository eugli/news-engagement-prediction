Fans of Alfie should fear not – the character is just taking a break and he will return next month. But we have now seen the last of Kassius Nelson in her role as tragic Jade. (Picture: Lime Pictures) \nWith Tabby having helped Alfie to finally let go, he paid an emotional and final goodbye to Jade before climbing into Tabby’s limo to head off for a great adventure. \nMeanwhile, Marnie Nightingale faced a dramatic day too as her vengeful actions almost led to the death of Mac. Marnie set fire to the restaurant, unaware that Mac was sleeping inside but as Marnie insisted that he and Lisa Loveday had been having an affair and that they were involved in Nathan’s death, no-one seemed to believe her and she was taken away for treatment. (Picture: Lime Pictures) \nMarnie will be back though – and she has vowed revenge on Mac that viewers just know will have far reaching consequences for all concerned . \nSo with Alfie and Marnie only off screen for a while and Hollyoaks an Linda both open to future returns for Tabby, the heavy set of Nightingale goodbyes tonight aren’t quite as bad as they seem. (Picture: Lime Pictures) \nWhich is great – as we have recently been gushing about just how brilliant the family are at the moment. \nAnd you can guarantee even more big drama to come in the very near future. \nHollyoaks continues on Tuesday 28th February at 7pm on E4. You can see tonight’s scenes again beforehand on Channel 4 at 6:30pm.
