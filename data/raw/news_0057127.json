Boxing Bear is in the running to be one of USA Today's best brewpubs. The Albuquerque-based company was recognized as one of the top 20 breweries in America by a panel of brew experts, according to USA Today. Now, it's up to voters to decide the brewery's ranking on USA Today's 2017 Readers' Choice list. Boxing Bear Brewery Co. is currently in the top five brewpubs on USA Today reader's… more Christopher Ortiz | Albuquerque Business First Head brewer Justin Hamilton says he is excited and proud to have been nominated. \"New Mexico is quickly becoming known for producing some of the best beer in the country and we love being part of that progressive movement. We encourage all of our patrons and New Mexico beer fans to keep voting for us daily. Cheers to local beers,\" said Hamilton. On Wednesday, the brewery is maintaining a top five ranking but there are still 18 days for people to vote for their favorites. Great Lakes Brewing Company in Ohio is sitting at No. 1 while Michigan's Brewery Vivant and Oregon's Ecliptic Brewing are the other brewpubs that are ahead of Boxing Bear, putting it at No.1 4. Voters are able to weigh in every day and can cast their votes here. The brewery might be used to the recognition by now. Last year, it earned two gold medals and was named Mid-Size Brewpub and Mid-Size Brewpub Brewer of the Year at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver. Boxing Bear also won Albuquerque Business First's Battle of the Breweries last year after thousands of readers cast their votes. Boxing Bear opened in Albuquerque in 2014 and will celebrate its third birthday in July. Co-owner Kevin Davis told Business First last year that owning a brewery takes a lot of strategy and money. Davis also said that Boxing Bear produced about 2,000 barrels of beer. According to an economic impact report , New Mexico's beer distribution facilities directly employ 937 employees who earn $51 million in wages and salaries. The report also found that New Mexico beer distributors added $334.8 million to the nation's gross domestic product.
