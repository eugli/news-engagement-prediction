Texting while walking makes you 'zombie-like,' says Montreal researcher \n\"We're asking for the government to take the necessary measures to save lives,\" said Aref Salem, the executive committee member responsible for transport. \nToronto made a similar request of its provincial government last year, but was turned down. Councillors in Vancouver have also proposed banning cellphone-use while walking in crosswalks and on roadways. Ontario quickly turns down Toronto's request to ban pedestrian texting on roads \nMontreal's proposal found some support from a lobby group for the province's trucking industry. \n\"If pedestrians are texting while they're crossing streets, they could certainly be involved in a car or truck accident,\" said Marc Cadieux, president of the Quebec Trucking Association. \n\"This is where we have to find a bit of dissuasion towards pedestrians.\" Beware of the 'zombies' \nLast year, a study conducted by HEC Montreal's Pierre-Majorique Léger found that 30 per cent of people who text while walking make bad decisions because they're not concentrating. \n\"They're in a zombie-like state,\" Léger said at the time. \"They're so concentrated on their phones, but blind to their external environment. They're like zombies.\" \nHave an idea how to make Quebec roads safer? Now is your chance to weigh in \nThe consultations on road safety are being held around the province. Lobby groups, businesses, politicians and the public are able to make recommendations on the issue. \nAmong the other ideas floated on Monday was a renewed appeal by some Montreal-island mayors to allow motorists to turn right on red lights. \nMontreal is the only jurisdiction in the province where the manoeuvre is illegal, but in his presentation Salem reiterated the city's opposition to revising the rule.
