The wannabe photographer mingled with a slew of stars at the bash including Holly Willoughby, Charli XCX, Doutzen Kroes and Abbey Clancy. Looking fan-tache-tic! The eldest child of David and Brooklyn Beckham seemed to be growing a moustache as he sported a few hairs on his upper lip Happy display: Brooklyn sported a slight smirk on his face, which only seemed to emphasis his new look further Going solo: Brooklyn appeared to be heading into the bash alone 'I held him as a baby and now he's a big man!': His appearance at the BRITs seemed to shock former Spice Girl Emma Bunton (Far R) Wannabe: Emma sported black trousers and high heels as she posed for snaps with partner Jade Jones Frank Lampard and Christine Bleakley were also among the attendees, with Christine looking striking in a silky emerald green top and black trousers. His appearance at the BRITs seemed to shock former Spice Girl Emma Bunton who revealed on the ITV2 after show party: 'Brooklyn is here! 'I’m like, \"I held you as a baby and now he’s a big man!\" It’s frightening! He looks very handsome,' the songstress gushed. Going green: Christine Bleakley looked pretty in a slinky emerald shirt teamed with black trousers as she posed with husband Frank Lampard Behind the decks: There was no relaxing for BRITs host Dermot O'Leary who spun some tunes at the bash My other half: Dermot brought along wife Dee Koppang who cut an eye-catching figure in a black dress and fluffy coat Coordinated couple: Peter Crouch sported a velvet dinner jacket while wife Abbey Clancy sported a stunning one-shouldered black and white frock All the glamour: Nicole Appleton shimmered in blue while Ashley Roberts wore a black and white patterned number and Caroline Flack an LBD with leopardprint coat The teen star seemed in great spirits despite suffering a painful accident after he hit the slopes in Whistler. He shared a video of the moment he injured himself on Instagram where he showed his impressive snowboarding ability leading up to the accident, smoothly carving through the powder in the scenic setting. After seemingly negotiating the trickiest part of the descent, he falls forwards while on an innocuous wide expanse, cracking his bone in the process. Starry affair: Ed Sheeran and Noel Gallagher were among the guests at the Warners bash Two different looks: Zara Martin sported a leather-look black and orange striped frock while party-girl Amber Le Bon wore a semi-sheer top and maxi-skirt Fringe benefits: Pixie sported a metallic ensemble with fringed skirt Model behaviour: Doutzen Kroes sported a black dress teamed with padded jacket and chunky boots In their glad rags: Natalia Vodianova looked a striking sight in a pink embroidered and feathered gown while Holly Willoughby dazzled in a sequinned mini dress Party girls: Maisie Williams, Charli XCX and Louise Thompson all looked very different with Maisie going flouncy, Charli sporty and Louise sporting a classic little black dress Unlikely pair: James Blunt had a catch up and a photo with former footballer Frank, while Niall Horan was also at the bash in a suit and trainers The video, which was viewed almost 400,000 times in the first four hours, was simply uploaded with the caption: 'Broke my collarbone at the end.' Hours later, he shared an image of his X-Ray, displaying his collarbone ripped apart, putting him out of action for the rest of the trip. The family appear to be have spent some quality time together in the winter hotspot after a hectic and fraught few weeks. Ouch: The second-generation star also shared the X-ray confirming the injury on his social media Man down: The model lost control of his body, leading to the a violent impact on the snow Slope master: Prior to his tumble, Brooklyn navigated the mountain with precision Not only was Victoria busy preparing for her A/W17 showcase in New York City, emails were then leaked of David reportedly reacting angrily to not being given a knighthood. The former England captain allegedly branded the Honours Committee ‘unappreciative c***s’ in the messages, and dismissed lower awards. According to the revelations, the Honours Committee had already agreed that Beckham's nomination – almost certainly proposed by his PR advisers – was well 'merited' before a routine check of his tax affairs.
