It’s feasible, study finds ] \n“People on this side of the river will continue to have conversations for the next year or so, and if a coalition of regional leaders decide to go forward, we’ll try to re-engage Arlington at that point,” Sternlieb said. “By no means is this a death knell.”\nA cable-propelled transit system, like those in Portland, Ore., and connecting New York City’s Roosevelt Island to Manhattan, could serve as an alternative to a Metro station, Sternlieb said.\n\n\n\nThe six-tenths of a mile between Georgetown and the Rosslyn Metro station attracts 50,000 vehicles per day over the Key Bridge. The bridge’s sidewalks are Arlington County’s busiest, and bicycle commuters often use the bridge as well. Currently, DC Circulator buses, Georgetown University and hospital buses, and Metro and Arlington County buses shuttle over the river multiple times per day.\nIn truth, the participation of the Arlington County Board was extremely unlikely. Even when the board agreed a year ago to kick in $35,000 for a feasibility study, several board members expressed deep skepticism.\nThe study , which came out in November, estimated an $80 million to $90 million construction cost for the system over the Potomac at the Key Bridge, as well as $2 million to $3 million in annual operating costs. That weighed heavily on the board, said Vice Chair Katie Cristol (D). But she said it couldn’t compete with more-pressing priorities.\n“We want to send a strong signal to folks that Metro and Columbia Pike — that’s where our priorities are in the years ahead,” she said. “If this going forward with private investment money, we’d be happy to have a conversation about easements, et cetera.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:33:47.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
