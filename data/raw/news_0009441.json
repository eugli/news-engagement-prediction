Advertisement \nAfter your article about the racist Candice Hong who made inflammatory comments about Middle Eastern women dressed in burqa at MBS, she still refuse to back down from her racist attitudes towards people's choice of religious wear. Rather than apologise for her insensitivity to other religions, she insisted that she was right to suspect the lady of being a potential terrorist and told muslims to \"go n read your koran again, it never ask you to dress like this\". \nPeople went to her facebook post to correct her misconception but she arrogantly replied \"So what? Religion wasn't mention, only you guys perceived so...\". However they failed miserably and Candice Hong insisted that she was right to suspect them for being potential suicide bombers. She accused those who debated with her of inciting emotion impulsively without thinking. \nWhen an exasperated netizen threatened to file a police report against her, she brushed his words off and confidently said his report will be thrown out by the Singapore Police Force. I think a strong message needs to be sent to Islamophobes like Candice and the police needs to invite her for coffee. As Minister Shanmugam said, our religious minorities should be protected right? \nMatthias Lim", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T06:19:09.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
