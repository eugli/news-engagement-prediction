In an improvised speech at the Roma Tre public university, the pontiff warned against the death of face-to-face conversations. He called on young people to get off their phones during family meals, saying it could have dire consequences for society. Pope Francis said: 'When we're at the table, when we are speaking to others on our telephones, it's the start of war because there is no dialogue.' The 80-year old also chastised juniors for their lack of manners, accusing them of swapping a cheery 'good morning' for an 'anonymous \"ciao ciao\"'. He added that it appeared standard in today's society for people to 'insult' strangers. 'We need to lower the tone a bit, speak less and listen more,' he said, adding that 'dialogue which brings hearts closer together' is 'a medicine against violence'.
