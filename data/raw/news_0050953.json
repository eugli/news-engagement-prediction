She and her family moved to Northland from Australia four years ago. They would like to be able to buy a home but the heat in the market shocked her. \"I wouldn't have been surprised if it was in Auckland but I never would have thought Whangarei would get as high as it is.\" Rufus-Ellis recently started her own business and her husband receives a student allowance, so money is tight. \"We are trying to sort our finances to buy.\" READ MORE: Where have property prices increased the fastest? \nNow, she's hoping that signs Auckland's property prices are cooling might spread further afield. \nTrade Me's Property Price Index shows the average asking price in New Zealand's biggest city dipped to $895,000 in January, the second consecutive monthly decrease. 123RF \nAuckland sellers' price expectations may be cooling. \nHead of Trade Me Property Nigel Jeffries said Auckland's average asking price dropped 1.5 per cent in January, and it was the first back-to- back monthly decrease since June 2012. \n\"We're seeing definite signs that the Super City is taking its foot off the gas after a very wild ride. Homeowners in Auckland don't need to panic though, and will take some comfort that the average asking price in the city is still up almost 12 per cent over that past year.\" \nBut buyers in other parts of the country are not in luck yet. \nJeffries said Auckland's year-on- year growth was still \"incredible\" but was overshadowed in January by a neighbour. \n\"The Waikato region smashed its own record average asking price this month, hitting $511,750. That's a staggering increase of more than $100,000 in the past 12 months.\" \nThe average asking price in Waikato has soared by 43 per cent since January 2012. \nNorthland's average is up 20.9 per cent. Ad Feedback \nFor the whole of New Zealand, excluding Auckland, the average asking price was up 0.2 per cent to $475,700 since December. \nJeffries said, outside the City of Sails, the New Zealand property market remained extremely strong and the average asking price around the country was up 11.4 per cent over the last year, amounting to a $48,500 increase since January 2016. \nSix powerhouse regions reported strong double-digit increases in average asking price: Northland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Nelson, Wellington and Otago. \nJeffries said the dollar increases for each of these regions were \"eye-popping\". \"When you look at the jumps around the country you can understand the Kiwi preoccupation with investing in property - the increase in expectations over just 12 months has been incredible.\" \nCrystal Jobe-Roberts is another buying who has felt the heat of the \"halo effect\" pushing up prices around Auckland. \nShe decided to buy land at Maungakaramea and relocate a house on to it because it was the only way she could afford to get into the property market. \nShe said she first started looking in 2014 when prices seemed reasonable. But by the time the bought land in October 2015, things were already getting tight. \n\"We couldn't afford to do it, the prices were just too high for the amount we could borrow.\" \nHer partner's father had previously worked with relocatable houses, which gave them the idea. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:28:56.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
