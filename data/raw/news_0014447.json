Now, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies on Capitol Hill have recast their ambitions for a rapid-fire repeal, talking privately and publicly about a more deliberative process that could be phased in over weeks or months. “The political uncertainty surrounding repeal is growing,” said Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action for America, the advocacy arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation. “If the House has not passed a repeal bill and sent it to the Senate by mid-March,” Mr. Holler added, “that would be serious cause for concern.” Photo Representative Tom Price of Georgia at a confirmation hearing last month to become secretary of health and human services. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times The uncertainty is already reflected in the way Republicans talk about the health care law. Some now talk about “repairing” the law, rather than repealing it entirely. And in a twist of fate, many are facing tough, angry questions at town hall meetings — the mirror image of 2009, when Tea Party activists assailed Democrats who supported the law. A crowd of protesters gathered outside a town meeting in California held over the weekend by Representative Tom McClintock, who was escorted by police officers as he left the event, according to news reports . Representative Gus Bilirakis of Florida faced 200 angry supporters of the health care law at a meeting on Saturday. In the interview that aired on Sunday, Mr. Trump appeared to admit that his get-it-done braggadocio about a swift repeal of President Barack Obama’s signature legislation was instead becoming a drawn-out Washington process that could stretch for months or even years. Mr. Trump’s comment prompted what is becoming a ritual on Capitol Hill: trying to interpret the words of a president who is not steeped in the rhythms of the legislative process. “I don’t really know what he’s referring to in terms of a year,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican. He added that Republicans hoped to get their replacement plan in place “well before that.” \n  Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Republican in the chamber, said the Senate hoped to work “systematically, in a step-by-step way.” But he conceded “that may take longer than, you know, than people at first thought.” He expressed hope that “at some point,” if Mr. Trump has a health care proposal, “he’ll engage and that we’ll be able to work together with him on it.” Few of Mr. Trump’s campaign promises rivaled the one he made to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. He repeatedly called it a “disaster” and vowed that, if elected, he would immediately replace it with a new and better overhaul of the health care system. Mr. Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office directing agencies to do what they could to provide relief from the health care law to people and businesses. But his power to unravel the law unilaterally is limited. Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.
