By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 5, 2017 5:55 PM Sasikala Natrajan is selected as the new legislative leader of AIADMK. (Source: twitter) \nThe newly elected Legislative leader of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), Sasikala Natarajan is set to be the new Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu after O. Panneerselvam, a long-serving member of the party and trusted aide of former Chief Minister Jayalalitha resigned from the post on Sunday afternoon. He took over the post December 6, 2016 when Jayalalithaa succumbed to a major cardiac arrest and according to the PTI reports, he himself presented Sasikala’s name for the CM post. \nHowever, the announcement didn’t go well the people who took on to Twitter to criticise the move and remind the fact that they voted for Jayalalithaa and not Sasikala. People who also questioned her leadership abilities and vision on the social media networking sites. Here are some reactions on the appointment of Sasikala: \nIs This Really #Democracy ? People Of Tamil Nadu Voted For #Amma ,Not For #Chinnamma .Who Is She To Lead Them? #TNSaysNo2Sasi #AIADMK #sasikala pic.twitter.com/HIi9PAYPrx \n— Sir Ravindra Jadeja (@SirJadeja) February 5, 2017 \nWith what credibility is she taking the power of being a CM of such a well-established state in India?!

(@MyloMegha) February 5, 2017 \n\n— Saket Aloni (@SaketAloni) February 5, 2017 \nSasikala didn’t hold a specific position in the party but her decisions and advises were always taken seriously by Jayalalitha who declared her udanpirava sagodhari which means a sister not related with blood. However, on December 29, she was appointed as the General Secretary of AIADMK in the aftermath of Jayalalitha’s sad demise. She placed a copy of the party resolution appointing her as the AIADMK general secretary at the burial site of Jayalalitha with teary eyes.
