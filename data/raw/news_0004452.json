The complicated pride of three mixed-ancestry Indigenous women \nIn a statement, Bennett called it a \"historic step forward in achieving lasting and meaningful reconciliation for the benefit of the Métis Nation of Ontario and all Canadians.\" \nMargaret Froh, the president of the Métis Nation of Ontario, said Friday's memorandum has been 150 years in the making, as her people have long been forgotten in the discussion around Aboriginal rights, which has principally focused on First Nations and the Inuit. \nThe Constitution Act, 1982 recognized the Métis as a distinct and separate people, with rights and title, but little has been done to put those principles into practice, Froh said. Margaret Froh is the president of the Métis Nation of Ontario. Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett and the Métis Nation of Ontario signed a landmark agreement Friday, a deal that could result in new benefits for Indigenous people of mixed heritage, pending the outcome of negotiations. (Facebook/Métis Nation of Ontario) \n\"We know that Métis, in terms of the socioeconomic indicators, we know that we fall behind Canadians, on every single marker — education, health, housing,\" Froh said. \nMétis leaders have argued their people \"fall through the cracks\" when it comes to health services, employment and training, and education, supports that are offered to First Nations. \n\"Over the last 150 years, other Indigenous Peoples have had access to, for example, federal government policies, programs and services. The Métis have been excluded, and so with this signing of the memorandum … we're finally going to begin to move forward to define the relationship,\" she said in an interview with Rosemary Barton on Power & Politics . 'Political football' \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during the last election campaign to more adequately address Métis rights claims, which have been recognized by the Supreme Court in a number of recent decisions, including the Daniels case, which definitively ruled that tens of thousands of Métis and non-status Indians are the responsibility of the federal government. \nPrior to that ruling, the court found, Métis and non-status Indians were a \"political football,\" passed between federal and provincial governments, a situation that deprived the communities of significant federal funding for programs and benefits. \nThe Supreme Court did not specify what particular benefits Métis stood to gain from this status — if any — leaving it up to the two parties to negotiate on a nation-to-nation basis, hence the push to more clearly enunciate Métis rights. \nBoth sides will also have to accept who exactly a Métis is for negotiation purposes, something that has been a source of contention. \nThe Métis National Council has long said the only people who can rightfully claim to be Métis are those who are accepted by the larger community, and can trace their ancestry to someone who lived in the \"historic Métis homeland,\" which includes the three Prairie provinces and extends into Ontario, B.C., and the Northwest Territories. \nThis definition thereby excludes people who live east of Ontario, or those who cannot trace their roots back to an ancestor descended from a mixed European and First Nations marriage, in this area, from the 1700s onwards. \nOthers, including the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, a group that represents Indians living off reserve, and some Métis peoples, have said that definition is too restrictive.
