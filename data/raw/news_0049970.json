Le Pen wants to extend this ban to all public places, a measure that would affect Muslims most of all. \nHARIRI’S VEILED MESSAGE \nBuoyed by the election of President Donald Trump in the United States and by Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, Le Pen’s anti-immigration, anti-EU National Front (FN) hopes for similar populist momentum in France. \nLike Trump, she has said radical Islamism must be faced head on, although she has toned down her party’s rhetoric to attract more mainstream support and possibly even woo some Muslim voters disillusioned with France’s traditional parties. \nAfter meeting Hariri on Monday, Le Pen went against current French policy in Syria by describing President Bashar al-Assad as the “only viable solution” for preventing Islamic State from taking power in Syria. \nLebanon has some 1.5 million Syrian refugees. \n“I explained clearly that ... Bashar al-Assad was obviously today a much more reassuring solution for France than Islamic State would be if it came to power in Syria,” she told reporters. \nHariri, whose family has close links to conservative former French President Jacques Chirac and still has a home in France, issued a strongly-worded statement after their meeting. \n“The most serious error would be to link Islam and Muslims on the one hand and terrorism on the other,” Hariri said. \n“The Lebanese and Arabs, like most of the world, considers that France is the home of human rights and the republican state makes no distinction between citizens on ethnic, religious or class grounds.” \n(Additional reporting by Angus McDowall; Writing by John Irish; Editing by Tom Heneghan) MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:45:53.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
