The middle-aged driver can be seen grabbing the drunk by the shoulders from behind and shouting 'I don't take no **** from you!' The lout is dumped on the pavement beside the bus, which is stationary. Then the driver then addressed the shocked passengers and apologised 'for the disruption' before returning to his seat to resume the journey. The man had slurred 'there's a bit of DNA all over your face' before trying to walk away It's gone viral - the video has been viewed more than 4.3 million times. People quickly took to social media to support the bus driver's actions. One man wrote 'That bus driver is a legend. He stood up for what he thought (and was most probably brought up to believe) was right. 'You sir, have my utmost respect and I would like to shake your hand. You showed self control (which many of us most probably wouldn't have) to protect yourself and your passengers.' Heather McGauchie added 'He's lucky that's all he got getting thrown off the bus - well done to the driver staying as calm as possible. Shouldn't have to put up with that in any job.' An investigation has now been launched by Dorset Police and Yellow Buses but so far no arrests have been made. Paul Wren, commercial director of Yellow Buses, said 'We are aware of the video that has been posted on social media. 'The incident was reported to the police and we have launched our own internal investigation. It would therefore not be appropriate for us to comment further at this time.' It's understood the drama happened at 1pm last Saturday. The driver then addressed the shocked passengers and apologised 'for the disruption' Unite union regional officer Bob Lanning said 'Unfortunately, spitting by passengers at bus drivers does happen and can't be tolerated in any circumstances. It is completely unacceptable.' Norma Fisher, a 74-year-old tourist visiting Bournemouth with husband John, said she fully supported the driver's actions. 'Spitting is absolutely disgusting - it's just disgraceful' she said. 'I've seen people do it to policemen on the telly but never a bus driver. 'It's so disrespectful. I don't even like watching footballers do it.' John, 76, said 'If he had spat at me and he had come back, I would have given him a smack. That's just not on. I don't like it and I never have done.' On social media today Bobby Blue Eyes posted 'Fair play to the driver. What sort of person would be inebriated at 1pm in the afternoon? Scum! I hope he gets charged with common assault. Pathetic low life is a waste of skin and bone.'
