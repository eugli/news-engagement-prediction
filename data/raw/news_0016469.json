Flying high on his success, Hrithik speaks about the success of Kaabil, how the biggest compliments, for him, were those of his sons, Hrehaan and Hridhaan, and more.\nKaabil has garnered positive response and is also going strong at the box office. Were you expecting this kind of response?\nI always felt that it’s a good film and I was expecting a good response but this has truly been unexpected. The kind of praise that’s coming in, is mixed with a lot of dignity and respect. It added so much more to a simple success. I just love the way people are noticing all the minute things.\nWhich has been the best compliment that you have received so far for your performance in Kaabil?\nEvery student of cinema needs that pat in the back. So the praises of all my mentors and people that I look up to was amazing. Having said that, the best compliment has been from my sons. They saw the film and they said this is the best Hindi film ever made. That was so nice to hear. They are very honest critics of mine; they have never given me more than 7.5 on 10. So this was a great compliment.\nYou have always been touted as the stylish actor in Bollwyood what’s style for you?\nI don’t know much about style but I do have the idea about what looks good on me. Basically, style is about confidence and that confidence makes you comfortable with whatever you wear. I think style is about individual expression of what you are.\nWho do you look up to when it comes to fashion?\nI would say my stylists are the ones I look up to because they support me. Rekha is someone else that I look up to, not just in terms of style but just her charismatic persona. I have no words for the kind of love and support she has given me. She has been an enormous support in my life.\nDo you crave for awards?\nAwards are important to motivate the young aspiring stars and it’s the acknowledgment of your work, so of course it’s a cause for celebration. But it’s important to respect them, never crave for them because it’s given by human beings and not by God.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:10:22.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
