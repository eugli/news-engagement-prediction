Photo: Louise Kennerley \nHe was due to retire from the position later this year but it is understood Mr Scipione will now bring forward his departure from the force. \nThe 58-year-old joined the NSW Police Force in 1980, became a deputy commissioner in 2002 before succeeding Ken Moroney as police commissioner in August 2007. \nHe will have been the longest serving police commissioner in NSW since Normal Allan held the post between 1962 and 1972. \nMr Scipione's contract as commission was extended by two years in 2015 after a police bugging scandal plagued the upper levels of the force and involved his two obvious successors - Nick Kaldas and Catherine Burn. Advertisement \nThe two year extension was aimed at securing a smooth transition to appoint the next commissioner. \nSince then Mr Kaldas has retired and the government has announced a restructure of the police hierarchy has increased the number of deputy commissioners from three to five. \nMs Burn and Dave Hudson remain as deputy commissioners but the government is yet to fill the other three vacant positions. \nMORE TO COME", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:02:34.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
