Article continues below \nVan Persie scored the winning goal in the 72nd minute at the Vodafone Arena, but Besiktas will feel that justice wasn’t served on this particular occasion. \nWhy? Because they were reduced to 10 men just before half-time when Dusko Tosic was shown a straight red card for a ‘headbutt’ - if you can call it that - on Fener’s star striker. Article continues below Watch: Griezmann's questionable reaction after Torres scored against Leganes Video: Van Persie and Tosic incident \nReplays showed that although Tosic had put his head towards Van Persie - a daft move, admittedly - the former Premier League star exaggerated the contact. \nBasically, his theatrics deceived the referee. Tosic's wife hits out at Van Persie \nNeedless to say, Van Persie’s actions sparked a fierce reaction from Besiktas fans, and not just those watching from inside the stadium. \nTosic’s wife, the pop star Jelena Karleusa, couldn’t hold back her anger and slammed the Dutchman by posting an X-rated tweet. \n\"R. van Persie is one stupid motherf**ker,” she tweeted, “Brake a leg a**hole!\" \nJelena then removed the tweet after her husband had a quiet word. \n“Dusko asked me to remove my tweet about Persie, and I did,” she added. “What can I say, I don't like dirty players. Kisses to all Besiktas fans!” RvP involved in more controversy during second half \nVan Persie was involved in further controversy in the second half with his goal celebration. \nAfter scoring, he deliberately celebrated in front of Oguzhan Ozyakup - his former Arsenal teammate, no less. \n\"I have a lot to say about the incidents on the field. But I won't say them,\" the 24-year-old told reporters, per Goal . \n\"Just one thing: I was very good friend with a certain player on the field. That changed today. Sometimes you see the real face of a footballer on the field.\" \nOh, Robin… \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
