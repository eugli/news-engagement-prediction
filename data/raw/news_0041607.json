But it's actually FIFA 17 that Romelu Lukaku is focusing on. \nThese days there's multiple reasons to keep an eye on which players of performing well in the Premier League from week to week that are outside of the results. \nFirst there's Fantasy Football, there won't be many fans who have had the blow of seeing their team concede slightly lessened by the goal being scored by someone in their 'Fantasy' team. \nAs well as Fantasy Football there's also FIFA 17's Team of the Week to keep an eye on and the improvement for certain player's ratings because of their form. \nThis week FIFA released some boosts and decreases in certain players ratings from the Premier League based on form for the whole season: Over 60 @premierleague players have had their ratings updated! Next league on Sunday.
