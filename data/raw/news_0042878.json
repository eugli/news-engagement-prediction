Man who stalked wife caught when phone hidden in bonnet to track her started ringing \nImages of the grisly injury were captured by Sam’s colleague Mathew Meagher, 30, while the pair were working on a site outside Swansea, Wales. \nSam, from Port Talbot, was rushed to A&E and needed minor surgery to remove the nail, which was embedded nearly three inches into his body – missing a major artery by just millimetres. \nConstruction worker Sam said: ‘I was using a nail gun outside and unfortunately I was using it to fire something towards me and the nail just ricocheted and went into my groin. Sam Rees was apparently unfazed by the accident (Picture: Facebook/Mercury) The builder accidentally shot himself with a hydraulic nail gun (Picture: Mercury) \n‘The nail was 90mm long and it was embedded 70mm deep. Doctors said it missed my artery by 10mm. If I had pulled it out myself I would have bled to death. \n‘I didn’t really realise how serious the whole thing was until I got to the hospital. I had to have minor surgery to take it out – but having the drip in my arm hurt more. \n‘I have been having a bit of stick from my colleagues. But if you do something stupid you expect it.’ Criminal justice blogger tries to kill himself as he’s jailed for being a paedophile \nStunned Mathew said Sam ‘wasn’t fazed’ as he stood in front of him with the heavy-duty nail embedded in his nether regions. \nHe said his colleague asked him whether he should pull the nail out himself but advised against this straight away for fear of it causing even more damage. \nAfter a gruelling hour-long drive from the site to A&E in Swansea, Mathew delivered Sam to the hospital doors and he was rushed straight to surgery but has since made a full recovery. \nMathew, who runs his own building company and has been a builder for 15 years, said: ‘For want of a better phrase, the nail was pretty much through his d**k. Ouch (Picture: Mercury) \n‘He came over to me and said he’d shot himself. It’s something that shouldn’t happen, and at first I couldn’t see anything. And then I saw it. I just went white. I couldn’t believe it. \n‘When we got to A&E we were told to wait, but when we showed them where the nail was his was rushed straight to surgery.’ \nHe added: ‘It makes your eyes water. Even looking back I’m flinching. I’m very relieved it wasn’t me. I had a couple of dates coming up that weekend.” \nA spokesman for the Health and Safety Executive confirmed the incident had not been reported to them.
