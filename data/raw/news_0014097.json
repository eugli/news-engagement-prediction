Barack Obama and Neil Gorsuch were obviously on different sides of those issues,” Brad Berenson, a Boston-based corporate litigator who was one of Harvard law’s class of 1991 alongside the former president and the new supreme court nominee , told the Guardian. Neil Gorsuch: a look at Trump’s supreme court pick \nEven though a typical Harvard law class is a sea of 500-plus ambitious, scholarly faces, Berenson said both Obama and Gorsuch stood out – for some contrasting but also similar reasons. \n“They were both well-liked across the ideological spectrum and they were not obnoxious. I enjoyed being around them. Both were reserved, genial and respectful, but with a sense of humor. And they were both conspicuous talents at the time, in terms of legal intellect, but it was very clear then that Barack was a philosophical liberal and Neil was a conservative, much more straight-laced, a straight arrow,” he said. Originalism: Neil Gorsuch's constitutional philosophy explained Read more \nHarvard Law professor Laurence Tribe called Gorsuch “a very, very bright judge” whom he also recalled from his university days was not just learned but “very personable”. \nHe says he knew Obama better at the time, as he was his research assistant, and got to know Gorsuch better later on, after he became a judge. Tribe also taught current supreme court judge Elena Kagan, class of ’86, who went on to become Harvard law school’s first female dean. \nHe recalls the young man who became the first black editor of the Harvard Law Review and then America’s first black president as “an incandescent intellectual, who was much more articulate than almost any student I have had in over 40 years”. Obama drew attention as one of just a handful of minority students, of course, but Tribe said he was such a distinctive character and intellectual luminary that he would have stood out at Harvard regardless of skin color.

Obama went back to the South Side, the conventional Gorsuch went off to clerk on the Washington DC circuit and then for supreme court justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, before a stint in corporate law. Gorsuch also won a scholarship to Oxford University in 1992 and began his PhD, in a formative trip where he met his British wife and further crystallized his conservative views. \nIn later years, as a rising judge, Gorsuch would go to Tribe for suggestions for bright and independent-minded star students from the law school who would make good clerks for him. \n“The people I can think of that I have recommended in the last 10 years or so have enjoyed working for him a great deal and liked him – and some of them were even liberal,” Tribe said. It was very clear then that Barack was a philosophical liberal and Neil was a conservative, much more straight-laced Brad Berenson, former classmate at Harvard law \nHe believes that the intellectual and political ferment at Harvard at the time made both Obama and Gorsuch stronger characters with more rigorous skills to examine their own ideas. \nKeith Boykin, the author and commenter, studied with the two men and, perhaps unsurprisingly, as a budding progressive activist in the Black Students Association, he has stronger recollections of the liberal Obama, whom he recalls giving a stirring speech at an association rally. \nBut what Boykin does recall about Gorsuch is that, while “some conservatives there were very outspoken in a negative way to me, he was not one of them”. \n“It was a tense atmosphere on campus, a polarized environment, there were big issues being fought over like lack of diversity in the faculty and the new dean at the time [Robert Clark] was very conservative and pro-business,” Boykin recalled. So Gorsuch was not amongst the loud anti-liberal provocateurs, but he was unmistakably, staunchly conservative. \nAt Oxford, he studied under John Finnis, the controversial Catholic conservative professor and strident proponent of natural law. \n“That’s telling,” said Harvard law professor Charles Fried. Fried had taught Obama and knew Gorsuch because he was a prominent member of the Federalist Society at the university, of which Fried was a faculty adviser. Obama and Gorsuch’s careers diverged after law school – Obama followed his passion for community work while Gorsuch became a clerk in Washing DC.

He has spoken out since about his strong belief in the “inviolability of life”, which has been taken as a signal, in addition to Donald Trump’s repeated assertions that he intended to nominate a supreme court justice who is against Roe vs Wade, that Gorsuch is anti-choice. \n“I would suspect he would join opponents [of Roe vs Wade] that have chipped away at the edges of the abortion right. Maybe it will be a case of ‘you have the right but you may not be able to get it [a termination] anywhere’ because of all the regulatory hurdles,” said Fried. \n“Having said that, Texas tried that and the supreme court reversed it,” he added.

But Fried drew contrasts. \n“He’s not like Scalia in that he writes very well but he does not … there is not a sarcastic or aggressive remark from Gorsuch. He tries to ties things to precedent and isn’t trying to make the newspapers with quotes. And there is no instinct to belittle or insult people who criticize him,” said Fried. \nHe also pointed out that the two men are of opposite opinions on the so-called Chevron deference, which can easily come into play on the administration of immigration, health or environmental laws, for example. \nScalia firmly believed federal government agencies have the overriding power to interpret statutes and the courts should “greatly defer” to that, said Fried. \n“Gorsuch thinks that’s wrong. And that is ominous,” said Fried. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:03:21.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
