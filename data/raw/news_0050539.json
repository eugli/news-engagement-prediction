The design was inspired by the reflections of the colourful boats found in Mġarr harbour which also reflects Għajnsielem’s vibrant community. \nIn fact, the community had the time not only of mosaicking but also in making personalised clay fish with the help of ceramic artist Hermine Sammut, who also fired and glazed the fish. These are now integrated in the 47 mosaic risers. Thus, Għajnsielem’s community is co-creator and owner of the mosaic stairs as much as the artists themselves. « Book signing Seminary fundraiser » Advert \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
