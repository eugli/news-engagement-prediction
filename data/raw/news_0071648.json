It was the unofficial name of a four-block long dirt lane that formed the nucleus of Vancouver's first concentrated African-Canadian community.\" (Canada Post)\n\"We don't have a cultural centre, we don't have a place where people meet and talk ... a place where we can have courses, training, all sort of learning exchange activities.\"\nThe city has produced an \"emerging directions\" document , based on rounds of feedback thus far. A final plan and vote is expected to take place by the end of the year. \nMugabo is hopeful events like the one he hosted will help the city consider the need for a new space for his community. \n\"We'll continue to push. History is on our side. A wrong was done to our community, and we need to find a way to move forward. We've given so much to the city, and we feel the city should give something back.\"\nWith files from Megan Batchelor", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:44:18.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
