Since my family isn't here, I like to be in an area where most of my friends live. It's nice to be in a place that's near restaurants and museums, so you can take advantage of what a city like this has to offer. But because I also want to go to brunch and travel, I have a small business as my side job.\" \"I created my consulting business when my roommate wanted to move back home to St. Louis. I needed the extra income. I could afford my apartment by myself but not if I still wanted to save, invest, travel, shop, eat out, and see Broadway shows. I work for my clients in the morning before work, during my lunch break, in the evenings, and on weekends â€” basically, anytime I can fit it in.\" 2. $3,000 for a 1-Bedroom in Brooklyn Name and Age: Genevieve, 33 Location: Fort Greene, Brooklyn Occupation: Writer at a tech company Salary: $125,000 Apartment: 1-bedroom apartment in a high-rise building Roommates: None \"This is more than I ever thought I'd pay in rent.

This is just what places like this cost in New York.\" Getty 3. $470 to Share a 3-Bedroom in Atlanta Name and Age: Lavon, 34 Location: Atlanta Apartment: 3-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom townhouse Roommates: Two \"I wanted roommates because it makes rent so much cheaper.

I've had five different roommates here and eventually I got tired of sharing the space. Once I started making more money, I decided I wanted to live here alone. Right now, I'm using the extra room as a walk-in closet. I love having a separate space to get my look together in the morning. This place has a huge kitchen and a wonderful living room. I lived in New York for a few years before I moved here but this was the first apartment that felt like home to me.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 5. $800 to Share a 2-Bedroom in Phoenix Name and Age: Jennifer, 26 Location: Phoenix Occupation: Small business owner, event planner Salary: $60,000 Apartment: 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom townhouse Roommates: One \"I could afford a nice one-bedroom in this city, but I hit the jackpot and found an amazing place and a great roommate.

I love having a doorman and concierge. I want to feel safe and I like that no one can just walk up to my door. I also feel safer having a gym in the building and not going out late to the gym. I spent all this money on school to get degrees and you want to have something to show for it. It's worth it to pay a little bit more and have your own space.\" 7. $950 to Share a 2-Bedroom in Burbank, California Name and Age: Whitney, 33 Location: Burbank, California ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:50:10.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
