As we sift through the evidence, here’s what the people who were there are saying about the most memorable Oscar moment of the year. Warren Beatty \n“I want to tell you what happened,” Beatty said as he retook the stage after presenting the Best Picture Oscar … and after everyone realized what had transpired. \n“I opened the envelope and it said ‘Emma Stone, La La Land ,’” Beatty explained. “That’s why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn’t trying to be funny.” Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP \nBeatty was overheard at an after-party telling someone, “It was nice La La Land got to give speeches and then Moonlight did.” Emma Stone \n“I f—— love Moonlight . I’m so excited for Moonlight, ” Stone told reporters backstage after the show. “It was an amazing thing to hear La La Land . We all would have loved to won Best Picture.” \n“I also was holding my Best Actress in a Leading Role card the whole time. I’m not sure what happened, but I really wanted to talk to you guys first,” Stone said adding, “I think everyone’s in a state of confusion still. Excitement but confusion. I think everyone is just so excited for Moonlight . It’s such an incredible film.” Naomie Harris \n“It is really surreal. I went up on stage with this weird expression on my face like, ‘What is happening?’” Harris said at the Governor’s Ball. “I don’t know what I’m going to look like on screen, I started shaking. I thought, Is this a prank or something?” \nShe continued, “It’s a shame it happened like that in a way, because it was such a beautiful moment. What is important is that we won and it’s a huge honor and we are totally and utterly thrilled. And we are going to celebrate big time tonight.” Barry Jenkins \n“I think all the movies that were nominated were worthy, so I accepted the results, I applauded like everyone else,” Jenkins, Moonlight ‘s writer and director, said in the press room after the show. \n“I noticed the commotion that was happening, and I thought something strange had occurred. I’m sure everybody saw my face, but I was speechless with the result. I had always watched the Academy Awards, and I had never seen that happen before. It made a very special feeling even more special, but not in a way I expected. MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty \nJenkins added, “I will say, I saw two cards, and so things just happen. I wanted to see the card, and Warren refused to show the card to anybody before he showed it to me. And so he did. He came upstairs and he walked over to me, and he showed the card. Everyone was asking, ‘Can I see the card?’ And he was like, ‘No, Barry Jenkins has to see the card, I need him to know.’ And I felt better about what had happened.” \n“I will say, the folks from La La Land were so gracious,” Jenkins said. “I can’t imagine being in their position and having to do that. We spent a lot of time together over the last six months, and I can’t imagine being in their position. It’s why I was speechless — I wasn’t speechless because I won, I was so speechless that they had to do that.” Mahershala Ali \nIn the press room after the show, the Oscar winner explained how things went down for him. “When their name was read, I wasn’t surprised, I was really happy for them.” Ali said. “It’s a group of really extraordinary people. When I did see security or people coming out on stage, and their moment was being disrupted in some way, I got really worried.” Christopher Polk/Getty \n“And then when they say, ‘ Moonlight wins,’ it just threw me a bit,” Alie continued. “It threw me more than a bit. I just didn’t want to go up there and take something from somebody. \n“It’s very hard to feel joy in a moment like that, but I feel very fortunate for all of us to have walked away with the best picture award. It’s pretty remarkable.” Jordan Horowitz \nIt was Horowitz, a La La Land producer, who first announced the flub to the audience. He later described the moment to E!, saying, “There was a guy, a stagehand guy, who started kind of buzzing around, looking for the envelope” while the musical’s cast and crew where celebrating onstage. \nWhen the envelope was found, the stagehand “opened it, and it said ‘Emma Stone, La La Land’ on it,” Horowitz said. “At that moment, it was clear there was a problem. They eventually found the best picture envelope.” Show Full Article More People Logo", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:33:40.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
