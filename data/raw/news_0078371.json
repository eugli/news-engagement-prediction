Ricardo Bofill The building started life as a concrete factory Ricardo Bofill 12 What was once a brutal structure is now dripping with greenery \nOver the decades Bofill and his team added lush vegetation and turned it from an industrial shell into a unique work of art – La Fabrica. \nBofill said: “Seduced by the contradictions and the ambiguity of the place, we quickly decided to retain the factory, and modifying its original brutality, sculpt it like a work of art. \n“Presently I live and work here better than anywhere else. It is for me the only place where I can concentrate and associate ideas in the most abstract manner.” Related stories Forget the London property bubble - house prices are rising MORE in Liverpool and Birmingham MAKING ROOM ON THE BUS Family of five tired of pricey rents convert school BUS… but have to cope with frozen pipes LIGHTHOUSE FAMILY Stunning lighthouse on remote Scottish island that comes with three family homes on sale for £275,000 HOME FIT FOR A QUEEN Church clock tower once owned by the Queen and now converted into a family home goes on the market for £1.8million HOUSE OF GOD Inside the divine £600,000 home converted from a CHURCH - and it comes with its own stained glass windows Ricardo Bofill It has been a project in the making for more than four decades Ricardo Bofill “It is for me the only place where I can concentrate,” he said Ricardo Bofill The awe-inspiring property is near Barcelona Ricardo Bofill 12 The interior is elaborate but retains the bare concrete walls \nThe exterior is covered by grass, eucalyptus, palm, and olive trees and gives the impression that the property has been partially reclaimed by nature. \nEvery room is uniquely furnished but he kept the raw concrete walls as a “memory of the structure’s former use”.
