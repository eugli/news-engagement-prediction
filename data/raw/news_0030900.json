The first eight episodes of Season 7, which aired last fall, put the immediate, brainless horror of the zombies themselves on the back-burner. Instead, it played like torture porn, intercutting brutal scenes of human-on-human physical violence with brutal scenes of human-on-human psychological violence. It was neither fun to watch nor interesting. But at the very least, last year’s midseason finale ended on a promising note, as Rick Grimes finally got his groove back and decided to lead a rebellion against Negan and the rest of the Saviors. \nFollowing that tack, the back half of Season 7—which begins with tonight’s \"Rock in the Road\"—should play like The Dirty Dozen , or maybe a heist movie, as Rick assembles a crew for that daring assault on the Sanctuary, an old factory that serves as the Saviors’ compound. But before we reach that climactic standoff, I suspect the rest of Season 7 will be spent contending with a different enemy: Time. Specifically, the seven hours of television The Walking Dead will need to fill before we can actually get to the all-out war we’ve been promised. \n\"Rock in the Road\" isn’t a terrible episode of The Walking Dead , but it’s a pretty uneventful one (despite an unnecessarily extended runtime, in what’s quickly becoming the show’s new norm). Over Gregory’s objection, Maggie quickly secures an alliance with the residents of the Hilltop community. Meanwhile, Jesus leads Rick to the Kingdom, where he tries (and, at least for now, fails) to get King Ezekiel to join the resistance. \nThe Kingdom is Season 7’s most ridiculous new addition to the Walking Dead universe, which makes it my favorite new addition to the Walking Dead universe. The medieval code of chivalry followed by the Kingdom’s various residents—the kids learning archery, the \"knights\" running around with their horses and their body armor—are exactly the splash of color that The Walking Dead ’s grimly monotonous world needed. And, of course, there’s King Ezekiel himself: grandiose and theatrical, perched atop his \"throne\" with a pet tiger stalking around behind him. \nBut as he once revealed to Carol, Ezekiel isn’t the goofy lunatic he seems to be. All the medieval pomp and circumstance is an act, designed to keep his followers optimistic and inspired, while he quietly makes more pragmatic decisions that will keep them happy and safe. \nSo Rick might be a little misguided when he appeals to Ezekiel not with logic, but with a fairy tale from his own childhood, about a little girl who ripped a large and dangerous rock out of the road. Once the rock was finally gone, Rick says, she discovered a large bag of gold—placed there by the king, to reward the person who sacrificed their own time and effort for the good of everyone else. \"The king put that rock in the road because he knew the person who dug it out—who did something—they deserved a reward,\" Rick explains. \"They deserved to have their life change for the good forever.\" \nIt’s a cute little story—but does it stand up to scrutiny? Of course not. Negan wasn’t \"put in the road\" by some benevolent force. He rose to power, and came to dominate every other faction in the area, because he chose to be more ruthless than anybody else. And there’s no guarantee of a reward at the end. In the best-case scenario, a bunch of people die while successfully toppling Negan and his followers. In the worst-case scenario, Negan and his followers slaughter everyone who participates in Rick’s rebellion, and everything gets that much worse for the \"lucky\" survivors. And there's certainly no reason to believe that even a total victory against Negan would lead to a lasting peace. Ezekiel, to his credit, rejects Rick’s simplistic parable, refusing to lend the might of the Kingdom to the cause. There’s a very good case to be made for standing up against Negan, but \"everyone will live happily ever after\" is not it. \nSo what are we supposed to make of the fairy tale that gives the episode its title? As usual, I can’t quite decide if Rick is stupid, and The Walking Dead knows it and wants us to recognize it—or if The Walking Dead is simply stupid on its own terms and doesn’t know it. Before the end of the season, the Kingdom will undoubtedly join Rick’s cause—there wouldn’t be a much of a story if they didn’t —but it’s going to take a better argument than the one Rick gives in \"Rock in the Road.\" (It might come from Ben, who urges Ezekiel to be a hero, or Morgan, the pacifist who may eventually realize that a war now could lead to a longer-lasting peace later.) \nIn the meantime, Ezekiel grants Daryl asylum. The remaining survivors head back toward Alexandria (and, along the way, end up mowing down dozens of zombies in a very cool action sequence involving a steel cable strung between two speeding cars). Our heroes arrive back home just in time to greet Simon, Negan’s second-in-command, who happens to be hunting for Daryl. \nThanks to Ezekiel, they don’t find him—but they do discover that the all-important pantry has inexplicably been emptied. Once Simon leaves, Rick discovers the explanation: Father Gabriel has been dragged away by the mysterious figures whose houseboat Rick and Elliot raided in last year’s \"Hearts Still Beating.\" Rick leads a small contingent of Alexandrians toward the houseboat to recover both Gabriel and the supplies, but the rescue attempt is thwarted almost immediately, as the group is surrounded by dozens of armed survivors. Maybe that’s how The Walking Dead will flesh out this half-season’s worth of stories; like whack-a-mole, you can never be sure when a brand-new threat will suddenly pop out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:22:23.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
