The gym said it would close the location at 1120 E. Kennedy Blvd., in a Facebook post on Tuesday evening. Memberships for the downtown gym will be honored at the second Powerhouse location, at 3251 W. Hillsborough Ave., which is about a 15-minute drive away. John Sanguinetti, Eddy Midyett and Matt Midyett will close Powerhouse Gym's downtown… more Nola Laleye \"Regretfully, due to dramatic rent increases and continuing issues, it no longer makes economic sense for Powerhouse Gym Downtown to continue business in this location,\" the gym said in a statement. Mercury Advisors , which owns the space Powerhouse leases, is the original developer of Grand Central at Kennedy. Principal Ken Stoltenberg was not immediately available for comment Wednesday morning. Brothers Eddy Midyett, Matt Midyett and John Sanguinetti opened the gym on the ground floor of Grand Central at Kennedy in 2009. At 40,000 square feet, it is one of the largest occupiers of retail space in Tampa's urban core. None of the owners were immediately available for comment Wednesday. It is not the only large tenant to vacate Grand Central. In early 2016, BoConcept, a high end furniture store, shuttered its location in the development, citing disappointing sales . The closures come at a time when the northern end of the Channel district is beginning to blossom. Construction is under way on a 21-story apartment tower on the vacant block directly north of the gym, and an adjacent Publix Super Markets Inc. store will break ground once the tower tops out. Across the street from the gym, the Fitzgerald, a luxury apartment development, is about to open on a site where derelict warehouses previously stood. In subsequent comments on its Facebook announcement, the gym told concerned members that it was still in \"heated negotiations\" with Mercury Advisors. \"We are not even done negotiating with the developer, so we are notifying you before we even know for sure but are being proactive because we don't see anything positive going to happen,\" the gym wrote in response to a comment. \"We are closing Friday because the remaining time we will need to remove items and shut it down.\" In 2015, the owners of Powerhouse took issue with the Grand Central courtyard along Madison Street that provides outdoor seating for patrons at Cena, Pour House and City Dog Cantina. The courtyard, they said, was costing the gym business. With the courtyard in place, all traffic from the Grand Central parking garages must exit onto Kennedy Boulevard, causing traffic jams and delays.
