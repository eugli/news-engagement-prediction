The film is an incredibly lighthearted take on a traditionally bleak comic book mythos, and now it seems that McKay sees this project as a possible stepping stone towards working within the live-action DCEU . The LEGO Batman Movie 's director recently spoke with Juan Fernandez-Paris from De Pelicula TV and told him: \nThe movie, obviously, works as an audition for the kind of filmmaking that I would want to bring to the table. And if you don't think that I'm not hanging outside of Geoff Johns' office when I'm on the lot every week, hanging out, hoping that he's going to notice me... yeah, I definitely would love to do a live-action DC movie. I love these characters and this world. So yeah, I'd love to be a part of it. \nIn an attempt to make sense of this fantastic development, we have put together a few possible projects that would perfectly suit Chris McKay's offbeat sensibilities as a filmmaker. Because as it turns out, the DCEU has a strong need for directors! Check out our list and let us know what DCEU adventure you would like to see McKay take a crack at. Now let's kick this list off with a DC project that just cannot seem to keep a director in place. The Flash \nIf you have followed the news related to The Flash's solo movie, then you probably already know that it has experienced an insanely tumultuous development process over the course of the last year. Between the departures of Seth Grahame-Smith and Rick Famuyiwa , The Scarlet Speedster's first silver screen outing has gone through disheartening setback after disheartening setback. \nThat's where Chris McKay comes in. The Flash is an inherently light-hearted superhero, and McKay's ability to deliver rapid fire, DC-inspired comedy in The LEGO Batman Movie serves as a reliable indication that he could represent the perfect choice to handle Barry Allen's quick-witted sensibilities for this project. Arguably no other member of the Justice League is better suited for direct comedy than The Flash, so DC should embrace this opportunity to inject some much-needed humor into the hero side of the DCEU.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:20:00.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
