But he left the band in 1974 to start making solo albums, billed as Junie. Except for orchestral arrangements, Mr. Morrison usually sang, played and produced every part, as another Midwestern prodigy — Prince — would do a few years later on his debut. On his solo albums, Mr. Morrison sang flirtations, dance invitations, philosophy and social commentary in tunes that drew on funk, ballads, jazz, blues, rock, reggae and Latin styles. He was also an early experimenter with technology like synthesizers, vocoders and drum machines. And he had a humorous streak; quacking duck sounds turn up across his discography. From 1978 into the early 1980s, he joined Mr. Clinton’s funk empire, working with Funkadelic, Parliament and the P-Funk All-Stars and on Mr. Clinton’s solo debut album, “Computer Games.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Morrison was credited both under his own name and as J.

He collaborated on John Tesh’s “Give Me Forever (I Do),” which became a wedding perennial with James Ingram’s vocal, and went on to produce much of Mr. Ingram’s 1999 album “Forever More (Love Songs, Hits & Duets).” In the 2000s, Mr. Morrison revitalized his solo career on his own new label, Juniefunk. He recorded as Junie Morrison, with the 2004 album “When the City,” and under aliases including Micronagual, Algorithm and BoyinSea. Last year, determined to combat what he saw as an “all-time high” of negativity, he released ambient music both as Junie Morrison and as BoyinSea . “Musicians, if they choose to, can drive a tonal wedge through the noisome pestilence; the stench that often accompanies our contemporary societal lifestyles,” he said. “I wanted to conceptualize an escape from the tensions and atmospheric pollution, even if it’s only a temporary psycho-acoustical one.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:23:04.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
