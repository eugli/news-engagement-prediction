(Jeff Chiu/Associated Press) \nA federal appeals court decided late Thursday to take no further action on President Trumpâ€™s travel ban while the administration prepares new, more limited restrictions designed to mollify legal objections. \nIn a brief order, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said a vote on whether to reconsider the court's Feb. 9 decision to continue blocking the ban will not be held pending further action from the Trump administration. \nTrump announced Thursday that his administration would not appeal the earlier. Instead, he said his administration plans to unveil a new executive order designed to limit the ability of people who might be associated with terrorism to enter the United States. \nThe ban blocked by the 9th Circuit prevented citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. for three months, leading to the cancelation of at least 60,000 visas. \nA federal judge in Seattle federal judge earlier this month issued a temporary restraining order nationwide against enforcement of the ban in response to a suit brought by the states of Washington and Minnesota. The government appealed to the 9th Circuit. \nA three-judge panel of two Democratic appointees and one appointed by a Republican unanimously agreed that the ban was likely to violate constitutional guarantees of due process. \nFollowing that decision, an unidentified 9th Circuit judge asked that an 11-judge panel be convened to review the ruling. \nBut in an order late Thursday, the court said that In light of the upcoming new executive order, it would pause its proceedings \"pending further order of this court.\" Latest updates", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:55:26.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
