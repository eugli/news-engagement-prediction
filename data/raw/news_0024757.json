It's dismal and I think it's pretty embarrassing that we are behind other the states.\" \nMr Clifford said up to 3,000 WA businesses could also benefit, allowing their battery storage assets to be depreciated over three years rather than 15, which could pay off their battery storage unit within 10 years. \nThe scheme would be co-funded from the removal of federal fossil fuel and mining subsidies. \nGreens supporter Rowena Skinner powers her home using solar panels but said she could not afford to install battery storage. \n\"For most people, the price is the issue, it is the main barrier,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:06:32.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
