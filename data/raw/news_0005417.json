Ad Feedback \nRolinson, who was the subject of an internal party complaint in 2013 and charged with cannabis possession in 2015, said the group was \"not a one-man band\", with many NZ First members concerned about Jones. \n\"From everybody I've talked to, we're talking dozens and dozens of people, I'm yet to hear anybody say anything actually positive...so it's about making sure those people actually have their voices and their concerns heard.\" \nSome current NZ First MPs and board members were also worried about Jones, Rolinson claimed, although he would not name them. \nJONES: NO WAITANGI ANNOUNCEMENT \nJones said he did not want to comment about the Facebook page, or whether he was a member of NZ First. However, he ruled out any announcement of a political comeback at his Waitangi Day party, saying it was about \"simple hospitality\". \n\"There will most certainly be no announcements from myself on anything to do with politics.\" \nNZ First leader Winston Peters said \"the source in the NZ First Leader's Office is no source at all\" in reference to claims by Rolinson the media had a source there. \nJones was a Labour MP for nine years, serving as Immigration Minister, Trade Minister and Building Minister. \nIn 2010, he was forced to admit to using his Crown credit card to rent pornographic films while at hotels on government business, apologising and describing himself as a \"red-blooded, robust dude\". \nHe made an unsuccessful bid for the Labour leadership in 2013, before jumping ship ahead of the 2014 election to take up a Pacific economic ambassador role created by Foreign Minister Murray McCully. \nBut that contract ends in May and he does not plan to renew it - opening the way for him to link up with his old friend Peters. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:01:11.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
