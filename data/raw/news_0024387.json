(Supplied: William Grace) \nWA's South West Interconnected system (SWIS) — which provides power as far north as Kalbarri and as far south as Bremer Bay — is fuelled largely by a mixture of gas and coal, providing much-needed baseload power for periods when the sun is not shining. \nSince 2010, the amount of solar power produced on the SWIS network has grown to 650 megawatts, and Professor Grace predicted it could rise to 9,000 MW by 2035. \nHe said that scenario made baseload power almost redundant. \n\"The impact will be felt by about 2025, when there will be so much solar energy being exported from private houses that it will start to impact on the generation on the network, particularly coal-fired generation or baseload power,\" he said. \n\"The private solar from houses and businesses exported onto that network effectively reduces the demand below the level that baseload coal can operate.\" Regulator's modelling flawed: professor \nAEMO oversaw the electricity market in Western Australia and makes predictions about future power demands on the network.

(ABC News: Andrew O'Connor) \nIts modelling predicts rooftop solar energy will grow at a linear rate, meaning the market will grow at the same amount each time step. \nHowever, Professor Grace said that modelling was flawed because the market was growing at an exponential rate — with uptake doubling in each successive period. \nHe said AEMO modelling of linear growth in solar uptake inadequately assessed the growth in demand, and in turn the amount of solar and storage that would be on the grid and the impact it would have on the conventional generation network. \n\"So one of two things can happen. Either the coal-fired power generation is switched off or alternatively, the private solar will have to be switched off,\" he said. \nThis scenario was realised by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) in 2013 in their analysis of the impact of solar on network generation. \nCalifornia now produces around 20 per cent of its power from renewable sources. \nCAISO analysis identified the risk of overgeneration, when more electricity is supplied than needed to satisfy real-time electricity requirements. Minister Nahan dismisses concerns \nThe State Government said it trusted the AEMO projections and advice regarding future power demands in WA. \n\"AEMO is the trusted authority on providing forecasting and security advice as it draws information from a range of experts, including industry and governments, and I have total confidence in its advice,\" Energy Minister Mike Nahan said. \n\"The latest Australian Energy Market Commission report confirms West Australians continue to pay among the lowest in Australia for electricity.\" \nThe AEMO was contacted by the ABC about Professor Grace's report and said everyone was entitled to their opinion, but declined to comment any further.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:47:34.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
