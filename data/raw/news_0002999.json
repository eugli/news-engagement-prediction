The excerpt of the call did not detail who exactly Trump considered \"bad hombres,\" nor did it make clear the tone and context of the remark, made in a Friday morning phone call between the leaders. It also did not contain Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's response. Mexico denies that Trump made the threat. Still, the excerpt offers a rare and striking look at how the new president is conducting diplomacy behind closed doors. Trump's remarks suggest he is using the same tough and blunt talk with world leaders that he used to rally crowds on the campaign trail. A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. The Mexican Foreign Relations Department told The AP: \"The negative statements you refer to did not occur during said telephone call. On the contrary, the tone was constructive.\" The phone call between the leaders was intended to patch things up between the new president and his ally. The two have had a series of public spats over Trump's determination to have Mexico pay for the planned border wall, something Mexico steadfastly refuses to agree to.

I think your military is scared. Our military isn't, so I just might send them down to take care of it.\" A person with access to the official transcript of the phone call provided only that portion of the conversation to The Associated Press. The person gave it on condition of anonymity because the administration did not make the details of the call public. The Mexican website Aristegui Noticias on Tuesday published a similar account of the phone call, based on the reporting of journalist Dolia Estevez. The report described Trump as humiliating Pena Nieto in a confrontational conversation. Mexico's foreign relations department denied that account, saying it \"is based on absolute falsehoods.\" Americans may recognize Trump's signature bombast in the comments, but the remarks may carry more weight in Mexico. Political analyst and former presidential spokesman Ruben Aguilar notes Pena Nieto had enjoyed an apparent spike in his low approval levels, as Mexicans rallied around him for publicly challenging Trump in the border wall dispute. The latest remarks could undercut that, if Pena Nieto is viewed as \"weak,\" he said. Trump has used the phrase \"bad hombres\" before. In an October presidential debate, he vowed to get rid the US of \"drug lords\" and \"bad people.\" \"We have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out,\" he said. The phrase ricocheted on social media with Trump opponents saying he was denigrating immigrants. Trump's comment was in line with the new administration's bullish stance on foreign policy matters in general, and the president's willingness to break long-standing norms around the globe. Before his inauguration, Trump spoke to the president of Taiwan, breaking long-standing U.S. policy and irritating China. His temporary ban on refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, aimed at reviewing screening procedures to lessen the threat of extremist attacks, has caused consternation around the world. But nothing has created the level of bickering as the border wall, a centerpiece of his campaign. Mexico has consistently said it would not pay for the wall and opposes it. Before the phone call, Pena Nieto canceled a planned visit to the United States. The fresh fight with Mexico last week arose over trade as the White House proposed a 20 percent tax on imports from the key U.S. ally to finance the wall after Pena Nieto abruptly scrapped his Jan. 31 trip to Washington. The U.S. and Mexico conduct some $1.6 billion a day in cross-border trade, and cooperate on everything from migration to anti-drug enforcement to major environmental issues. Trump tasked his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner - a real estate executive with no foreign policy experience - with managing the ongoing dispute, according to an administration official with knowledge of the call. At a press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May last week, Trump described his call with Pena Nieto as \"friendly.\" In a statement, the White House said the two leaders acknowledged their \"clear and very public differences\" and agreed to work through the immigration disagreement as part of broader discussions on the relationship between their countries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T13:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:47:07.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
