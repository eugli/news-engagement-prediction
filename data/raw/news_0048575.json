Highlight of the day \nOn Saturday, Trump returned to one of his favorite places for one of his favorite activities: giving speeches in front of adoring crowds. As the theme from the movie Air Force One blasted through the speakers, the presidential airplane itself rolled up to the rally just after 4:30 p.m. \nAfter a quick introduction from first lady Melania Trump, the president continued his blistering critique of a favorite enemy: the news media. \n“The dishonest media, which has published one false story after another, with no sources, even though they pretend they have them — they make them up in many cases — they just don’t want to report the truth,” Trump told the cheering crowd. \nTrump worked to further the wedge between his supporters and journalists, positioning reporters, not Democrats or even the establishment he has railed against, as the untrustworthy opponent. \n“They could not defeat us in the primaries and they could not defeat us in the general election,” Trump said, about reporters. “They have their own agenda, and their agenda is not your agenda. In fact, Thomas Jefferson said ‘nothing can be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself,’ he said, ‘becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle.’” \nAlthough Jefferson did once write those words, in a letter to a friend in 1807 , Jefferson was also a staunch defender of the free press. \nIn 1787, in another letter, he wrote: “Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.” Trumpspeak “Life is a campaign. Making our country great again is a campaign.” — President Donald Trump to reporters on Air Force One, explaining why he wanted to hold a campaign-style rally so early in his term Tweeter in chief \nEarly Saturday, Trump took to Twitter to blame his predecessor, President Barack Obama, for the challenges Trump is now facing. Trump did not specify the challenges to which he was referring. Don't believe the main stream (fake news) media.The White House is running VERY WELL. I inherited a MESS and am in the process of fixing it. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2017 \nTrump also took time to plug his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, as the “Southern White House.” The cost of membership at the club recently skyrocketed, given the president’s penchant for bringing foreign leaders and high-powered executives to dinner at the resort: It now costs $200,000, plus annual fees, according to The New York Times . Will be having many meetings this weekend at The Southern White House. Big 5:00 P.M. speech in Melbourne, Florida. A lot to talk about! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2017 What’s next \nAccording to press secretary Sean Spicer, the president will remain in Florida on Sunday, where he will meet with candidates in contention to replace Michael Flynn as national security adviser. Trump will be meeting with Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, acting national security adviser Keith Kellogg, and West Point superintendent Lt. Col. Robert Caslen, Spicer said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:20:07.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
