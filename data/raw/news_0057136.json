The Prime Minister has been coming under heavy pressure over her rates shake-up Brighton Pier faces a rate rise of 17% (Photo: Getty) \nTory MPs' anger had forced Theresa May into what first looked like a climbdown over her far-reaching shake-up of business rates. \nThe campaign began when it emerged some web giants would be let off more lightly than small high-street shops. \nIt is feared struggling firms will go to the wall when bills start arriving ahead of April. \nGreen MP Caroline Lucas warned world-famous Brighton Pier is facing a 17% increase - while a nearby hotel faces a 400% hike. \nShe said at Prime Minister's Questions today: \"The government's business rates hike could devastate the local economy in my Brighton constituency.\" Mrs May faced anger over the business rates row at PMQs \nMrs May replied: \"Business rates, of course, are based on the rental values of properties. And the rental values of properties do change over time, they go up and down. \n\"And it's right that rates change to recognise that. That's the principle of fairness that underpins the business rates system. \n\"We also though want to support businesses, and recognise that for some, business rates will go up when these revaluations take place. \n\"That's why we've put significant funding in place for transitional relief. \n\"But I recognise there has been particular concern that there will be some small businesses that will be particularly adversely affected by the result of this revaluation. \n\"That's why I've asked the Chancellor and the Communities Secretary to make sure there's appropriate relief in those hardest cases.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:11:46.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
