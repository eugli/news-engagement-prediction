Slovenia’s Ilka Stuhec was second, followed by Austria’s Michaela Kirchgasser in third.\n“The problem (with the course) right now is that it’s not cold enough to freeze, and it’s not warm enough for the salt to work,” Vonn said.\n“If we get a little cooperation with the weather and the salt works, I think it could potentially be okay (for racing Saturday and Sunday).”\nWith Shiffrin on the sidelines, Stuhec moved 80 points closer to the American's overall Cup lead but is still 338 points back in third place. Switzerland's Lara Gut remains second, but is out for the rest of the season.\nFive speed and four technical events remain on the calendar, plus another combined on Sunday.\n(Reporting by Larry Fine in New York; Editing by Clare Fallon)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:16:29.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
