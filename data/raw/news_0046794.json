All the passengers escaped safely, although three were treated for minor smoke inhalation. \nPreliminary investigations suggested an electrical problem in the engine bay was to blame for the incident. \nA final report into the fire will be released in the next fortnight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:44:23.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
