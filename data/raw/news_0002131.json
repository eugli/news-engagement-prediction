Unsurprisingly, the post rode the wave of internet excitement for hours, and now, with around 6,306,000 likes and climbing, it has become the most-liked post on Instagram to date.\nBeyoncé, with 92.6 million followers, bests previous record-holder Selena Gomez, whose 2016 sponsored post of her slurping down a Coke garnered more than 6,305,000 likes. Gomez, with 108 million followers, still has the most popular account on Instagram.\nWe would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters\nA photo posted by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST\nAs Beyoncé’s like count climbed, the comments on Gomez’s reigning Instagram post were overtaken by ecstatic members of the Beyhive, buzzing about the impending takeover. But if tonight’s coup has taught us anything, it’s that Instagram users love pop music and famous babies — two things that will probably always be in great supply.\nCongrats to Beyoncé!
