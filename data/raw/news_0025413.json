Both actors surprised their fans in their respective films as they were seen in a new avatar. We are talking about Rana Daggubati’s terrifying villainy act as Bhallaladeva and Taapsee Pannu deglam yet gutsy character as Meenal. The two are coming together for yet another intriguing film – The Ghazi Attack. It’s based on the mysterious events that took place around the Indo-Pak war of 1971. While they were set to talk about this upcoming movie, Bollywoodlife wanted to know if Rana Daggubati had managed to catch Taapsee’s Naam Shabana trailer! The high octane actioner had released the previous evening and had opened to a rave response. So did her co-star (who has already acted with her in three films across different languages) manage to catch it? The answer is yes! but the bigger surprise was when Taapsee let out a big secret,” Sometimes he tweets my trailer even without watching it.”Whoa! She has let the cat out of the bag! Rana sheepishly agreed and said there was this one time, she asked him to do it. They both had a good laugh over it. So next time he tweets out a trailer, we will never know if he has actually watched it or not (Haha). Does this include the Naam Shabana trailer as well? Their camaraderie was evident throughout the interview. They were even colour co-ordinated as both chose to wear navy blue. You can check out the video and see for yourself! \nTheir upcoming movie – The Ghazi Attack also stars Atul Kulkarni and Kay Menon. The movie is based on an incident in history when a Pakistani submarine PNS Ghazi had set out to destroy the one and only aircraft carrier – INS Vikrant. It was a classified mission, so very few knew about it. This incident happened just before the war broke out. The project has been headed by a newcomer – Sankalp Reddy who has tried to piece this event in history with all the resources he could find. The movie is set to release on Feb 17th. It will be releasing in Hindi and Telugu. \nThe trailer received rave reviews, as we got to see a submarine based war film for the first time. We can’t wait for this war story to unfold on the big screen in 3 days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:23:03.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
