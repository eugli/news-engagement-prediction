Because of its huge size, it takes longer to show any change with regard to climatic patterns. But there are instances of indirect impact which have been caused due to the prevalence of small glaciers situated above Gangotri. When temperatures rise, these glaciers melt fast due to their small size and the water generated from them flows down and seeps into the crevasses of the Gangotri glacier, causing them to melt from the bottom.\" \n\nHe added that since the small glaciers are situated on the right side of the Gangotri glacier, it is the right side of the base that is most impacted. \n\n\"We are not much concerned about the receding of the glacier since it is not so drastic. Our concern is more about the mass loss. Due to thinning of its shape, Gangotri glacier has become vulnerable to fragmentation which would ultimately lead to breakage and loss of water.\" \n\nThe scientists are yet to work out the short-term and long-term implications that the thinning of the base will have on the water flow from the glacier. \n\nEminent environmentalist Chandi Prasad Bhatt , one of the pioneers of the Chipko movement , told TOI that the findings need to be carefully studied and understood since they involve the water flow of the Ganga river.TOI that the findings need to be carefully studied and understood since they involve the water flow of the Ganga river. \n\n\"Scientists should conduct precise studies on how the receding and mass thinning of the glacier will impact the water outflow. Generally, higher snowfall will curb the receding and loss of volume in a glacier while less snowfall will indicate otherwise. But these are factors that need to be properly studied since they concern the important issue of water availability which affects people's lives directly.\" \n\nAcknowledging that more studies need to be conducted before a conclusion can be drawn on the impact of the receding and base-thinning of the glacier, DP Dobhal, a scientist at the Dehradun-based Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, said, \"Gangotri glacier is a dynamic structure -- tectonic activities below its surface keep happening and creating fissures. Therefore, there are multiple factors that impact its health like its gradient, bed slopes, volume, sources, etc, each of which has to be studied in detail before arriving at a firm conclusion.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:43:04.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
