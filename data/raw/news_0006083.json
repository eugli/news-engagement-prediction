The frequently confusing (and critically contentious) prequel to Lynch’s frequently confusing hit TV show , Fire Walk With Me recounts the last week of teen beauty queen (and eventual plastic-wrapped murder victim) Laura Palmer’s life. \nShowtime will start streaming the film on March 1, ahead of the May 21 arrival of Lynch’s revival of the show. The film stars the show’s Sheryl Lee, Kyle MacLachlan, and Ray Wise, plus some suitably weird appearances from Chris Isaak, Kiefer Sutherland, and the aforementioned Bowie. Also, it’s full of spoilers for Twin Peaks proper, so if you’re still getting caught up on the series—also streaming via Showtime—steer clear until you’re done. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:47:10.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
