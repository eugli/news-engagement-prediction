Kefir contains several major strains of friendly bacteria and yeast, making it one of the most diverse and potent probiotics available. YOGHURT Eating yoghurt has been associated with numerous health benefits, including improved bone health and keeping you fuller for longer. Yoghurt may also be better than milk for people with lactose intolerance as some of the bacteria turn some of the lactose into lactic acid. This is also why yoghurt is sour tasting. Always read the label though, as not all yoghurt has live bacteria and some brands tend to include a significant amount of sugar in the products, with such processing often destroying any live bacteria. WHAT IS 'GUT HEALTH'? We all have trillions of different microbes in our guts. The latest thinking is that this microscopic community, known as the microbiome, acts like an organ in the body, performing various vital functions. A healthy, balanced microbiome helps us break down foods, protects us from infection, trains our immune system and manufactures vitamins, such as K and B12. It also plays a role in regulating blood sugar and metabolism, and sends signals to our brain that can affect mood, anxiety and appetite. A bad diet, stress, alcohol and lack of sleep can upset your microbiome, creating imbalances that are increasingly being linked to conditions ranging from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to diabetes, high blood pressure, depression and obesity.

A study in older Japanese men found that that consuming natto beans on a regular basis was associated with higher bone mineral density. This is attributed to their richness in vitamin K2. SAUERKRAUT This is shredded cabbage that has been fermented with lactic acid, and it's very popular in continental Europe. In addition to its probiotic qualities, sauerkraut is rich in fibre, as well as vitamins C, B and K. It is also high in sodium and contains iron and manganese. Do be wary though of processed varieties, and opt for unpasteurised versions instead. The pasteurisation kills the live and active bacteria.
