The ad shows an array of diverse faces, with text flashing over the faces reading: \"We believe no matter who you are, where you’re from, who you love or who you worship, we all belong. The world is more beautiful the more you accept.\" And it ends with the brand's campaign hashtag, #weaccept. It may sound like a simple concept, but the ad makes one powerful statement. The ad comes on the heels of President Donald Trump's currently suspended executive order on immigration . The order indefinitely banned refugees from Syria from entering the U.S., it blocked refugees from any country from entering the U.S. over the next 120 days, and it blocked citizens—refugee or otherwise—from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entering the U.S. over the next 90 days. Right after the order was signed on January 27, airports began detaining refugees and residents trying to enter the U.S. from those seven countries, and some people were denied entry to the U.S. Yesterday, a federal judge temporarily halted the order . According to the New York Times , AirBNB wasn't planning on running an ad during the Super Bowl—until Trump's executive immigration order came into play. AirBNB's chief executive, Brian Chesky, shared his thoughts on Trump's order last week in a company-wide email. \"This is a policy I profoundly disagree with, and it is a direct obstacle to our mission at Airbnb,\" Chesky wrote in the email, obtained by the Times. The company's founders reportedly heard there was still space for Super Bowl ads, and they put together the powerful #WeAccept ad in just three days. The ad coincides with AirBNB's new commitment to house refugees. The company's founders explain on the AirBNB website that the Super Bowl ad marks the start of their new goal, which is to \"provide short-term housing over the next five years for 100,000 people in need,\" including refugees, disaster survivors, and relief workers. On top of that, the company also plans to donate $4 million to the International Rescue Committee over the next four years. AirBNB is taking serious action to fight for what they believe is right—and we couldn't be more on board. Watch the powerful AirBNB ad below.
