These pale male parliamentarians, including several knights of the shires and the schools minister, Nick Gibb, are sitting on solid Tory majorities. It’s not the sort of territory where uprisings are commonplace, but that seems to be what they are facing. Heads and governors in this quintessentially English rural area are revolting, taking their concerns about school funding directly to parents and Whitehall. Governors are threatening to down tools unless their voice is heard.\nOn the surface this campaign, WorthLess , appears to be in response to the second stage of the government’s consultation on a national funding formula . Calls for an end to the historical inequalities in funding between different local authority areas have been going on for a decade or more. It finally translated into firm proposals on the watch of the former education secretary, Nicky Morgan.\nHowever, Brexit and the changing of the political guard intervened. Details about how the new formula will work were delayed and the government is now up against the clock to implement a promise to eventually fund all schools from Whitehall, bypassing local authorities, before the next election.\nThe plan involves redistributing resources from better- to worse-off schools at a time of punishing austerity . But extra funding for deprivation, and transitional arrangements that restrict the losses to any one school, mean historical differences are locked into the final allocations. The losers aren’t losing as much as they had feared; some gainers aren’t gaining as much either.\nBetter schools, no money required? The Tories’ maths doesn’t add up | Lola Okolosie Read more \nIt may suit the government to pit local authorities against each other over how the cake is sliced up. This is a useful distraction from the real problem: the cake isn’t big enough.\nThe “flat” cash settlement that the government boasts is generous at a time of austerity is anything but flat. Escalating costs, particularly higher pension   payments, mean a forecast real-terms cut of 8% per pupil over the next few years.\nThe ramifications are huge. The National Audit Office says schools need to find £3bn just to stay even. Mrs May’s just-about-managing families won’t just see their children being educated in just-about-managing schools, but in ones facing insolvency.\nSubjects, teachers, professional development and support for areas such as mental health will be in scope for schools to stay afloat. No wonder the private schools are luring better-off families, and the empire-building academy chains are seeing an opportunity.\nOne giveaway line in the new consultation states that ministers have been warned against being too generous with schools in case it removes the incentives for them to “form partnerships and find efficiencies”. In other words, if you can’t drive academisation by the front door, go through the back.\nJudging by the rumblings of discontent from Conservative MPs , the grassroots rebellion might be about to spread to parliament. But another tweak to the funding formula isn’t really the answer.\nThe idea of finding a better way to distribute money is sound – anomalies and inequalities in the system have gone on too long. But reform can’t work fairly without a huge injection of cash to even out winners and losers.\nAnd it is unlikely ever to be fair without a clearer understanding of how much a high-quality education, taking into account context and background of each child, actually costs. The expert witnesses to last month’s education select committee were clear. No one really knows how much it takes to run a school optimally, or at which point the system will become so broke that it is no longer viable. The government appears to be driving in the dark.\nIt is inconceivable that this dire state of affairs won’t affect standards and equity. Local areas are rife with stories of parents in the richest schools being asked for donations to subsidise core provision.\nMeanwhile, new campaigns are popping up all over. The latest, Educ8% , led by headteachers in Essex, goes straight to the point. Until someone takes a year-zero approach to school funding, works out how much money schools really need and a formula that is fair, the missing 8% needs to be funded. The sooner ministers and MPs grasp this, the better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:53:27.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
