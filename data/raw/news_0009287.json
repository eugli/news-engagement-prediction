Recent research suggests that healthy, intact coastal wetland ecosystems such as mangrove ... New paper explains consequences of plant disappearance in salt marshes on the Atlantic coast January 25, 2017 \nAn important new research paper, titled \"Response of Sediment Bacterial Communities to Sudden Vegetation Dieback in a Coastal Wetland,\" examines the consequences of plant disappearance and changes in salt marsh soil communities ... Farming carbon: Study reveals potent carbon-storage potential of manmade wetlands June 24, 2013 \nAfter being drained by the millions of acres to make way for agriculture, wetlands are staging a small comeback these days on farms. Some farmers restore or construct wetlands alongside their fields to trap nitrogen and phosphorus ... Study finds restoring wetlands can lessen soil sinkage, greenhouse gas emissions October 30, 2014 \nRestoring wetlands can help reduce or reverse soil subsidence and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, according to research in California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta by Dartmouth College researchers and their colleagues. Restored wetlands rarely equal condition of original wetlands January 24, 2012 \nWetland restoration is a billion-dollar-a-year industry in the United States that aims to create ecosystems similar to those that disappeared over the past century. But a new analysis of restoration projects shows that restored ... Study: Tropical wetlands hold more carbon than temperate marshes October 8, 2008 \nIn one of the first comparisons of its kind, researchers have demonstrated that wetlands in tropical areas are able to absorb and hold onto about 80 percent more carbon than can wetlands in temperate zones. Recommended for you Wetlands play vital role in carbon storage, study finds February 2, 2017 \nHuman activity and development are correlated with reduced carbon storage in wetland soils, a new study published in Nature Communications shows. Plan to reduce air pollution chokes in Mexico City February 2, 2017 \nDecades ago Mexico City's air pollution was so poor, birds would fall out of the sky—dead. Locals said living there was like smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, according to one report. In response, Mexico City took ... Research examines for the first time the benefits and costs of novel water reuse systems February 2, 2017 \nThe \"decentralized\" water system at the Center for Sustainable Landscapes (CSL) at Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, which treats all non-potable water on site, contributes to the net-zero building's recognition ... Low level of oxygen in Earth's middle ages delayed evolution for two billion years February 2, 2017 \nA low level of atmospheric oxygen in Earth's middle ages held back evolution for 2 billion years, raising fresh questions about the origins of life on this planet. Coal mine dust hastens Arctic snow melt February 1, 2017 \nDust released by an active coal mine in Svalbard, Norway, reduced the spectral reflectance of nearby snow and ice by up to 84 percent, according to new University of Colorado Boulder-led research. High levels of black carbon found at remote site in Siberia January 31, 2017 \n(Phys.org)—A team of researchers with members from Sweden, the U.S., Russia, Norway and Austria has found higher than expected levels of black carbon at a remote test site in Siberia.
