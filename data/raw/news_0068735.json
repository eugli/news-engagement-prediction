Varoufakis stressed that he obtained the information from Schauble himself. \n“Merkel simply wants to extend and pretend until the German election is out of the way. The Greek government pretends it’s going to fulfill its target… but won’t do it. Yet again. It’s Europe.” \nWhen asked whether the current Greek government plans to leave in case it doesn’t make any progress, Varoufakis said that it would depend on the negotiations between Merkel and Schauble. \n“Schauble wants Grexit, Merkel doesn’t want Grexit. They haven’t worked it out… Until they make up their mind, this government is going to stay in power,” the minister noted.

He stressed, however, that Greece on its part should stick to the obligations in the agreements it signed up to. \nOn Monday, Greece and its international lenders agreed to a new set of reforms that would deal with Greek pensions, income tax and the labor market in exchange for a new tranche of loans, Reuters reported. The new reforms are to be enforced from the beginning of 2019, according to Greek authorities. \nExperts from the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the euro zone bailout fund ESM and the IMF are to visit Athens to discuss the details of the deal, the chair of the Eurozone Finance Ministers group Jeroen Dijsselbloem said. \n“There will be a change in the policy mix, moving away from austerity and putting more emphasis on deep reforms which is also a key element for the IMF,” he said. \nIn August 2015, Greece with its struggling economy agreed to a bailout deal closed with international creditors that provided Athens with about €32 billion ($33.7 billion) from the total of €86 billion ($90.7 billion).
