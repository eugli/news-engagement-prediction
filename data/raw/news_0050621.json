(Photo by Prasit Tangprasert) - + NAKHON RATCHASIMA – A housewives group in Muang district has found early success with a new income earner - selling strawberry plants in pots on social media. \nThe small group, about 15 of the wives in tambon Pho Khlang, experimented with several varieties of strawberry before settling on one best suited to the climate of this lower northeastern province in mid-2016. \nTheir endeavour has been supported by the municipality and the 23rd Infantry Regiment's Suratham Phithak Camp. \nBefore going with strawberries they had dabbled in several other means to boost their incomes, but none were outstanding in a market where the competition is tough. They had tried making clothing, growing rice berry, making wreaths, and hairdressing. \nSupitcha Thiparphorn, 51, leader of the wives group in Pho Khlang, said she had learned about strawberries and realised there could be a niche market, as the fruit is mostly grown in the North where the weather is cooler. \nThey discovered that all varieties can be grown in the province, but the plant needs proper care and handling. Once they had succeeded in growing strawberries, the group expanded cultivation and shared their knowledge with friends. \nLater, they began selling the plants in pots on Facebook and Line at 20 baht for a small plant. Mature plants ready to yield fruit fetch 200-300 baht each. \nMs Supitcha said the business had grown and they currently had more 1,000 orders. Most buyers wanted the plant as a decoration, either in the house or in the garden. \nThe group plans to expand their operation and experiment with foreign strawberry varieties from the US, Belgium and Japan. They will seek permission to expand their garden inside Surathm Phithak Camp and look forward to an improved lifestyle in the future. \nPho Khlang Municipal councillor Jeeranan Khunchanthuk said the the council normally allocates a budget to help groups of housewives find additional work. With the wives' success with strawberries, the municipality will in the future support the processing of strawberries, to add value to the fresh produce. \nMeanwhile, a strawberry garden in Khon Kaen has reported a good yield this year, thanks to the morning temperature averaging only 8-20°C this month. \nSarayuth Donkhamchaimongkol, owner of Nattaporn strawberry garden in Khon Kaen’s Kranuan district, said he harvested berries five times bigger than those he grew in 2016. He has around 20,000 plants and his fields are attracting both local people and tourists, all eager to buy his fresh strawberries. \nA visitor to Nuttaporn Garden in Khon Kaen's Kranuan district buys a container of plump, ripe strawberries.
