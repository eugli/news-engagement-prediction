It’s a spectacular piece of music, sadly neglected, and I’d be delighted to learn it and reintroduce it to today’s audiences. \nWhat’s your musical guilty pleasure? \nMy guilty pleasures are usually not musical! Does not practising count? I’ve gone on holiday a couple of times without my violin and although I try to convince myself that bringing it would have been useless, because sunbathing and practising don’t coexist well, guilt usually strikes after a couple of days.\n\nIf you had time learn a new instrument, what would it be?\n\nI would learn to sing. The Italian opera tradition, especially as to how it relates to phrasing on the violin, inspires me enormously. \nDid you ever consider a career outside of music? Doing what? \nMy father is a writer , and literature has always been my other great passion so it would probably have been my alternative course of studies. I am an avid reader and I think nothing is more stimulating than to immerse myself in the cultural and artistic background of a composer whose music I’m studying. When I first performed Shostakovich’s Violin Concerto No 1 , I discovered that one of his greatest literary inspirations was Mikhail Zoshchenko, an author I didn’t know. I ordered his short stories and was completely entranced. It was a bit like joining Shostakovich’s book club!\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nIf you had to pick one work to introduce someone to classical music, what would it be? \nA comic opera by Rossini, maybe The Barber of Seville. Abbado’s edition with Hermann Prey, Luigi Alva and Teresa Berganza is how I fell in love with opera as a kid; I used to watch it so much that the video’s paper cover gradually disintegrated. My Rossini obsession was shortly followed by a fixation with Tosca, which led to many awkward moments for my mother, who had to creatively answer a seven-year-old’s questions about sexual blackmail and torture. So maybe not Tosca, if we’re talking about a child. And if the language might prove a barrier, I’d instead suggest one the great Tchaikovsky ballets – The Nutcracker or Swan Lake. \nWhere is the most unusual place you’ve performed? \nFirst, a planetarium for a Valentine’s Day recital. The repertoire was solo Bach – couples sat “under the stars” and listened in total darkness. Which meant I had to play in the dark, too, which at first I thought would be no trouble because I was performing from memory. But I realised pretty soon that everything, from my balance to sense of direction, was being affected and I was inadvertently turning round and round while playing. Too bad I don’t know my constellations or perhaps I could have located the North Star and held my course!\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nThe second was the Volterra Fortress in Verona, among Italy’s most notorious maximum-security prisons. I played Mozart with the Orchestra della Toscana , and the deep sense of uneasiness started as soon as we left our mobile phones at the entrance and barred doors started slamming behind us. The conductor and I were given cells as changing rooms and armed guards accompanied us everywhere. Some prisoners got to sit in the courtyard for the concert; some were behind a fence. High-risk inmates and those with restricted status listened from behind the tiny windows of their cells. Leaving that place made me dizzy with relief, and for the first time I think I fully grasped the meaning of freedom.\n\nWhat’s been your most memorable live experience as an audience member? \nMy parents took me to the Verbier festival in Switzerland when I was nine, and it was an eye-opening summer. I remember having to duck the backstage guards as I was running around after autographs from performers who included Evgeny Kissin, Hilary Hahn, Martha Argerich, Sir Neville Marriner – as well as Sir Peter Ustinov, the incomparable narrator of the Saint-Saëns Carnival of the Animals . \nMore recently, it would definitely have to be Anita Rachvelishvili ’s recital at La Scala a few weeks ago. When someone is blessed with a voice like hers, hardly describable without resorting to hot chocolate or lava metaphors, it can be compared to the finest Stradivari or Guarneri Del Gesù violins – exceptional and so rare.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nWe’re giving you a time machine: what period, or moment in musical history, would you travel to and why? \nThe 19th-century Italian statesman Massimo D’Azeglio recounted a carnival masquerade I would have loved to witness. In 1821, Nicolò Paganini was in Rome to replace the conductor who was supposed to lead the premiere of Rossini’s Matilde di Shabran . The horn player had also fallen ill and Paganini even played a horn obbligato on the viola. That must have been a night to remember, but what followed definitely makes it top of my time-travelling priorities: “We decided to disguise ourselves as blind paupers and sing requests for charity. After jotting down some horrendous verses, Rossini immediately put them to music and made us rehearse again and again. He and Paganini had to act as the orchestra, strumming two guitars, and they decided to dress as women. Rossini filled out his already abundant form with bundles of straw, looking absolutely inhuman! Paganini, as thin as a door, and with a face that seemed to be the neck of his violin, appeared twice as thin and loose-limbed when dressed in drag. We had an enormous success.” Priceless.\nWhat was the last piece of music you danced to? \nWith my husband, to Bridge Over Troubled Water – our first dance at my wedding last year. But we were making such a hash of it that it wasn’t more than 30 seconds before we asked other couples to join us on the dance floor. I used to listen to Simon and Garfunkel as a kid in the car with my mum, and although at the time I found that particular song overly sentimental, it has grown on me and now it always brings tears to my eyes.\nWhat’s the most overrated classical work? Is there a warhorse whose appeal you really can’t understand? \nI hate to say this, but my brain just sort of shuts down as soon as I hear a Strauss waltz.\n\nWhat do you sing in the shower? \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nMusicals! I know all the words to Oklahoma, West Side Story, Evita and Chicago and have been to see The Phantom of the Opera live at least 10 times.\nFrancesca Dego performs the UK premiere of Wolf-Ferrari’s Violin Concerto with Daniele Rustioni and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra on 8 March .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:43:32.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
