Smooch: In the accompanying shoot, the Blondie star teases a kiss with her pal Pam Hogg Twinning: The American rock icon and her British designer pal also don identical ensembles Twin Peaks: The singer rocks a T-shirt bearing reference to Sheryl Lee's Twin Peaks character Pals: The Heart Of Glass singer and Pam have been close pals since meeting in the 1980s In the January issue of i-D magazine, American beauty Debbie and Scottish-born Pam spoke about how they first met in London's King's Cross in the 1980s. Recalling meeting Debbie and her bandmate Chris Stein through a mutual friend, she said: 'It was the first time I'd ever felt star struck. You reduced me to a five year old going, \"I love you, I love you.\" And you're looking at me going, \"Who IS this!\"' Pam added: 'I thought you hated me! I was holding your hand telling you I loved you and it seemed you were looking at me like, \"when is she ever going to stop,\" then Chris took my hand and dragged me to the dance floor and we had this marvellous moment. And then I left, with my tail between my legs!' On sale now: The spring 2017 issue of Wonderland magazine is on sale now During the interview, Debbie spoke with Pam about how they rarely get to hang out, saying: 'I never get to see you - we're both so busy but that's good. It's good we are busy. I love seeing your shows online. One day I'll be in town when your show is on. I saw Siouxsie Sioux in New York wearing one of your cat suits.' In 2015, the Debbie admitted to MailOnline that she doesn't put up old photographs of herself around her home, because it reminds her how much she has aged. ‘It’s horrifying seeing photos of myself from when I was younger,’ she said. 'It makes me realise how old I’ve become. I still get really surprised when I see myself and realise I’m not young any more. ‘Ageing is scary, and it’s particularly hard for women because we depend on our looks so much, especially if you’re in the public eye.’ She added: ‘I don’t have any photos of myself on the walls at home because I would find that strange... that’s where I escape.’ Blondie's next album, Pollinator, is set to b released on May 5 - two days after they're scheduled to play an anticipated show at London's Roundhouse, for which tickets are currently on sale.
