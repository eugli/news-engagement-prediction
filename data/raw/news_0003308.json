(AFP Photo) NEW DELHI: Victory over England on Wednesday in Bangalore has completed a hat-trick of series victories for Virat Kohli 's Indian cricket over the visitors in all formats, with this 2-1 Twenty20 international series win following the same scoreline in the ODI leg and a 4-0 sweep in the Tests late last year. Leading the way with the bat were Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh to push India to 202/6, but the star of the evening turned out to be 27-year-old legspinner Yuzvendra Chahal , who took 6/25   for eight runs.

Overall, India have contested 13 such T20I series dating back to 2009, of which they had won four before the deciding third match with England at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. And of these, three have come in the last 12 months. ALSO READ: Chahal's career-best 6/25 seals resounding series win for India India first won a bilateral T20I series in Zimbabwe in 2010, when a weakened squad led by Raina beat the hosts 2-0. The next series win was in January 2016, a landmark 3-0 sweep of Australia in Australia under Dhoni. Soon after, Sri Lanka visited and were beaten 2-1. Last summer, Dhoni led a revamped team to Zimbabwe where the result was a 2-1 victory. And now, having lost the opening match in Kanpur, Kohli's team has rebounded with victories in Nagpur and Bangalore. The other bilateral series contested were either lost or drawn. In New Zealand in 2008-09, India lost both T20Is; in 2009-10, they leveled 1-1 with Sri Lanka at home; ditto in Australia in 2011-12 and against England and Pakistan at home in 2012-13; on another tour of Zimbabwe in 2015, the series was shared 1-1; a few months later, South Africa toured India and won 2-0; the last series before the ongoing one was a two-game affair in Florida which West Indies won 1-0 after the second T20I was washed out. In purely one-off T20Is, India have beaten South Africa in 2006 and 2011, Australia in 2007 and 2013-14, West Indies in 2011 and Sri Lanka in 2012. Their defeats have come against Australia in 2007-08, England in 2011 (twice) and 2014, South Africa in 2011-12 and New Zealand in 2012. When it comes to T20I tournaments, India won the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in 2007 and since then have made it to the final once, losing to Sri Lanka in 2014. Dhoni's team last year lifted the Asia Cup with an unbeaten 5-0 run in Bangladesh.
