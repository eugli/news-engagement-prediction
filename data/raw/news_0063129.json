And that is perhaps a big score for the Kwid, which has already been on a roll. The SUV like design was very well liked in the Indian market, so much that the Kwid went on to be a major sales volume driver for the French car maker. The company has maintained that the Kwid is based on innovative customisations that keep the customers engaged. The RXL is available in a 1-litre engine and is available in both manual and AMT gearboxes. \nRenault has attempted to make the Kwid more approachable in the market and hence has kept pricing for the new variant extremely competitive. It is, in fact, Rs 22,000 more than the corresponding 0.8 litre version, while the new Kwid RXL AMT variant is priced at an introductory price of Rs 30,000 more than 1.0 litre manual transmission version. \nThe Alto K10 AMT comes with a price tag Rs 4.10 lakh, ex-showroom Delhi, and hence the new Kwid RXL is about Rs 26,000 cheaper. The Kwid RXL AMT is powered by the1.0 litre SCe engine, and comes with a 5-speed Automated Manual Transmission. Maruti Suzuki Alto K10 \nThe Alto K10 AMT was once one of the most affordable small cars with automatic transmission in India. It was first introduced in November 2014 and was the second AMT offering from Maruti Suzuki after the Celerio. \nPost introduction of the Kwid, sales for the Alto K10 were affected, and now with the launch of the RXL variant, Maruti sales may be hurt furthermore unless it comes up with a strong competition to the Kwid. \nThe Kwid takes an upperhand in this battle owing to its SUV stance, an aspect that is gathering a lot of attention in India. There is a massive liking for SUVs in the country, and compact crossovers like the Kwid are easy to drive and cheaper to buy. \nRenault recently announced that the small car had crossed the 1.3 lakh sales mark within a span of less than two years. It has been on sale since September 2015 and has been a major breakthrough for Renault in India.
