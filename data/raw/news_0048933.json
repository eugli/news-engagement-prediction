Late Night with Seth Meyers \n\"It turns out, what Trump was referring to was not a terror attack in Sweden, but a segment he saw the night before on Fox News about refugees in Sweden,\" Meyers said to his audience, which Trump himself explained in a tweet . \"So Trump literally saw something on Fox News and confused it for reality,\" the talk show host continued. \"Next thing you know, he's gonna lament the terrible treatment of people with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.\" \nAfter showing a clip of a reporter in Sweden who said people there were \"making jokes,\" Meyers comically explained to his viewers, \"That's how bad things have gotten under Trump, we're getting roasted by Swedes now.\" Referencing a Muppet character, Meyers joked, \"The Swedish Chef is like, 'Dude, even I don't understand a word you're saying.'\" Trevor Noah, Seth Meyers, more blast 'Hurricane Trump' for press conference antics The Late Show with Stephen Colbert \nAnswering Trump's question from the rally when POTUS asked \"Sweden, who would believe this?\" Colbert chimed in with, \"No one. No one would believe that,\" the Late Show host said. \"Well, not no one, but maybe someone who skips their intelligence briefings.\" \nHe then sarcastically deduced that \"Trump only accepts intelligence reports with the logo 'As Seen on TV.'\" \nBut just because Sweden had a low-key Friday night, doesn't mean Colbert passed up the opportunity to produce a good in memoriam segment. \"Tragically, Sweden is the third not-a-terrorist attack that has not shocked the world in the last month,\" Colbert said citing \"the Bowling Green Massacre\" and Atlanta . \n\"And just because this attack didn't happen, folks, doesn't mean we don't stand in solidarity with all the people who did not suffer.\" Colbert reasoned before paying tribute to Sweden's beloved gifts to the world like Swedish Fish, ABBA, and Ikea. #NeverFjorget.
