By Anusha Iyengar | Published: February 26, 2017 1:01 pm Batman Vs Superman: Dawn Of Justice Screening: Celebs Including Hrithik Roshan And Mandana Karimi Couldn’t Miss It! \nOne of most highly anticipated and flop movies of 2016, Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice, made it to Hollywood’s hall of shame. Well, we can’t really blame them. The film was a disappointment for everyone who loves watching superhero movies. Not to mention, it did make way for a lot of memes. Another film that tied with BvS to win a lot of Razzies was a documentary called Hillary’s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party, which was based on Hillary Clinton, of course! These two films won four awards each for their poor acting, direction, screenplay and writing. Though BvS walked away with the ‘Worst Picture’ award. \n“It all came down to two decidedly different examples of cinematic sludge: The $250 million comic book oop-us Batman v Superman and the faux right wing ‘documentary’ Hillary’s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party,” according to a statement by the Razzies. Dinesh D’Souza, the creator of Hillary’s America, got the worst actor for his narration and the worst director award. ” D’Souza lets scenes drag, jumping through history in ways that quash any sense of discovery and creating an overall sense of boredom” was what a critic posted on Rotten Tomatoes.

Jesse Eisenberg also took an award as the worst supporting actor for BvS. Batman v Superman also got the honours of winning the worst screen combo for duelling superheroes, Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill, as well as worst screenplay and worst remake, rip-off or sequel. \nThe Razzies started in the 1980s and is often called the anti-Oscars. They even organise a small ceremony to award the winners but most nominees never turn up. This year, however, there was no ceremony. In 2010, Sandra Bullock had turned up to collect the Worst Actress award for All About Steve just a day before she won the Best Actress Oscar for The Blind Side. The annual Razzie Redeemer Award went to actor-director Mel Gibson for Hacksaw Ridge.
