The project is collecting 100 anti-Trump anthems for his first 100 days in office, and today’s new addition is “Omaha” from Toro Y Moi.

Also, all of the proceeds are going to “organizations working on the front lines of climate, women’s rights, immigration, and fairness,” so you can probably handle giving $30 to some good causes anyway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:56:59.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
