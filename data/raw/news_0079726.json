When you see Azpilicueta break up another opposition attack... \nThe Spain international has been a first team mainstay since arriving from Marseille in 2012 but may be enjoying his best ever season, this term and is now being hailed as one of the world's best defenders by his boss. \nSpeaking at the Chelsea Pitch Owners gala dinner on Thursday night, the Blues' boss exclaimed, \"He's incredible in his new role. one of the best in the world in this role.\" \nThe Â£7m Chelsea spent on Azpilicueta has proven to be one of the club's finest ever pieces of business, with the former Osasuna youngster turning out 213 times over the past four and a half seasons, lifting a Premier League title, a League Cup and a Europa League in his time at Stamford Bridge. Here they are, all the lads.
