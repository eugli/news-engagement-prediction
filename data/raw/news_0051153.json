Their strategies have led to an oversupply of seats and depressed ticket prices, which are weighing heavily on the profitability of their services. \nEmirates, based in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, is the only one of the trio that discloses detailed earnings information. It suffered a 64% year-on-year plunge in group net profit to 1.3 billion dirhams ($353 million) in the April-September period of 2016. The airline blamed the profit decline on \"downward pressure on prices\" and \"dampened travel demand.\" \nIndustry analysts say the other two airlines -- Abu Dhabi-based Etihad and Qatar -- are on a similar binge. \nTo make matters worse for them, European budget carriers are entering the long-haul market. \nGermany's Lufthansa Group is increasing the number of long-haul flights operated by its no-frills unit, Eurowings. \nInternational Airlines Group, which counts British Airways among its members, is also considering a bet on a low-cost long-haul business. \nNorwegian Air Shuttle plans to expand its flights to North American destinations. \nThe Middle Eastern carriers are now worried about losing customers to such low-cost competitors. \nGrowing concern \nAlarmed by the inroads of budget carriers in the long-haul market, which no doubt will make it increasingly difficult for full-service airlines to survive on scale alone, the Middle Eastern powerhouses are now seeking greater operational efficiency through alliances with their European rivals. \nEtihad CEO James Hogan said the company's agreement late last year on joint flight operations with Lufthansa has surprised many people who have seen the two carriers competing fiercely for many years. \nEarlier this month, Etihad struck a four-year business deal to receive catering services from a supplier of Lufthansa Group in 16 cities around the world. \nEtihad and Lufthansa have also signed a memorandum on maintenance support for the UAE airline provided by a subsidiary of the German group. \nIn August, Qatar raised its stake in IAG to 20%. In an effort to cater to travel demand in Europe, Qatar has expanded joint flight operations with BA on European routes as well as between Doha and London. \nEmirates, the largest airline in the Middle East, is bucking the trend. Armed with massive financial muscle, the UAE-based carrier has decided to continue going it alone. \nBut the airline known for its fleet of large aircraft is also showing signs of a strategy shift. It is looking at buying smaller, single-aisle jets. \nThat means the company is reassessing its traditional and hitherto successful business model, which is designed to use large-capacity airliners like the Airbus A380 superjumbo to carry big crowds of passengers. \nEuropean airlines also see substantial benefits in partnerships with Middle Eastern rivals. Joint operations and other forms of cooperation among them will help curb capacity growth and excessive competition, which hurt their profitability and financial health. \nAnalysts say the current business environment may trigger a wave of alliances between Middle Eastern and European airlines in the coming years.
