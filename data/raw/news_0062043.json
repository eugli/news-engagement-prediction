She said, “I will be worried if she plans to be an actor. I don’t think it is as easy as it looks. You have to work extremely hard, especially if you are a woman. And I wonder if she has in her to bear with all of it. Also, there is a lot of failure involved, which many people don’t see. The failure is personal, your acting skills… the way you look on screen is slashed out in open.” \nCheck out Navya Naveli Nanda’s recent post: \nShe continued to say that she does not like her daughter being objectified as ‘hot’ or ‘wild’, saying that she is as normal as any teenager of today. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:56:17.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
