She says one of her supervisors told her not to “detonate on patrol” and others said she was a “moving target.” She said the abuse went on for years. \nShe says one of the lowest points came while working on Christmas Day 2012, when fellow officers tried to rip the hijab off her head. \nThe city’s law department said it was reviewing the lawsuit. The NYPD has about 1,300 Muslim officers and has made public pronouncements seeking more recruits. The department recently loosened its restrictions on beards for officers requesting a religious exemption. \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.   rewritten or redistributed.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:22:00.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
