Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDavid Luiz will be carefully nursed through the rest of the season – because he is still feeling the effects of Sergio Aguero’s horror tackle three months ago. \nChelsea star Luiz has yet to fully recover from the knee injury he suffered when he was taken out by Manchester City striker Aguero’s wild, red-card challenge on December 3. \nBlues boss Antonio Conte branded the knee-high shocker “dangerous” and admitted he feared for the Brazilian after watching re-runs which revealed just how bad the tackle was. \nLuiz, 29, has been able to feature in every league game since but is still being troubled by the injury and requiring treatment. He played against Burnley with strapping on his right knee. \nConte has rested his key defender when he can, leaving him out of Chelsea’s three FA Cup games so far, including last week’s win at Wolves.

If you have a family, you solve the situation and then can go forward. \n“This is very important to win the league: to create a team, to create a good spirit with your team, and for sure to have good players.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:00:16.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
