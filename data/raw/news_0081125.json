It's an important one. It's a big one. Maybe we should have been. But surely if the West Australian Nationals are going to be put to that scrutiny, that everyone would be put to that scrutiny.\" \nMr Grylls said Mr Turnbull's promise to help solve the state's low GST share had amounted to nothing. \n\"To come to Western Australia in August, promise a floor in the GST, to come back in February and crab-walk away from that promise … the 2019 federal election will be Armageddon for the federal Liberal Party,\" he said. \nHe reiterated his call for state and federal Liberals to back the Nationals' plan to raise $7.2 billion through a mining tax, and to quarantine that revenue stream from the normal GST calculations, ensuring it did not further reduce WA's share of GST. WA MPs not delivering GST reform: Davies (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor) \nNationals Deputy Leader Mia Davies told those at the breakfast the biggest political obstacle to quarantining the mining tax revenue for WA was the political \"bloody-mindedness and ideology\" of the Liberal Party at a state and federal level. \nShe said strong West Australian representation in the federal Cabinet had delivered little more than talk on GST reform. \n\"We've never had more representation from Western Australia sitting around the top table in Canberra,\" she said. \n\"They take their pay check, they fly over there, and they sit there and think about everything save the state that they come from,\" she said. \n\"You should be bloody angry about it. You should be angry about it. We are being smashed.\" \nMs Davies said the Nationals' plan to quarantine the extra revenue from the GST distribution process, was not an \"unfair ask\". \n\"We are still trying to do the right thing by the state,\" she said. \n\"Apply that critical thought to what has become a really hackneyed and horrible environment to operate in.\" \n\"You should have greater expectations of the people who seek to be your representatives. \n\"It is actually gutting when you have some of the conversations we have on a daily basis.\" \nDespite the mining lobby's extensive campaign against the tax, which cost more than $2 million, Mr Grylls said he remained confident of holding his seat of Pilbara, and believed the Nationals' primary vote would increase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:54:13.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
