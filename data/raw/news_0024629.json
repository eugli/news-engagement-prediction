Source: ABC 11 Mum watches daycare worker breastfeed her baby on CCTV \nKaycee Oxendine, of North Carolina, recorded the footage inside Carrboro Early School on Friday. \nIt shows a woman adjusting her top and bringing a child, claimed to be Ms Oxendine's baby son, to her chest to breastfeed. \nMs Oxendine is also an employee of the daycare, as a pre-kindergarten teacher. \nShe claims her son’s teacher told her he was constipated on Friday. \nShe also claimed when she was asked by an employee in the nursery if she could breastfeed her child, Ms Oxendine said no, twice. \n\"She said that she had a son and did I want her to put my child to her breast and breastfeed?” Ms Oxendine told ABC News. \n“And I said no, that's nasty. We don't do things like that.” \nMs Oxendine claims the video showed the woman pick up her baby and breastfeed him for several seconds. \n\"As a mum, you've taken something from me, because I wasn't able to defend my child,\" Ms Oxendine said. \n\"I wasn't there.\" \nAfter the incident Ms Oxendine claimed she rushed her baby to hospital because he had fallen ill and was throwing up. The video shows a woman bringing a young child to her breast and it's claimed the child in the footage is Kaycee Oxendine's son. Photo: ABC 11. \nShe said her son is lactose intolerant and can't have any milk products. \nThe director of the childcare centre told ABC News an employee had reported the incident. \nHe said the woman who breastfed the child no longer works at the centre. Ms Oxendine said she was fired on Friday. \nIt’s claimed the woman involved had been working in childcare for more than a decade. \nMs Oxendine has since demanded the woman face criminal charges. \n\"To me, a criminal act was committed against him,\" she said. \n\"Not only did you put your breast to my son, you also made my son sick because he's lactose intolerant. So you've put something in his body that his body can't digest.\" \nNo charges have been filed against the woman so far, according to ABC News.
