Howell Ave. The building formerly home to longtime south side Milwaukee eatery Dino's Italian Restaurant will likely be occupied by another restaurant serving up pizza. Marsel's Pizzeria, a Greenfield restaurant, is planning to open a location in the former Dino's, 4252 S. Howell Ave., according to documents filed with the city. The owner of Marsel's, Marsel Feto, is seeking to buy the building from the city, which acquired it through a property tax foreclosure in January 2016 and had since been advertising the property on the Department of City Development website. Enlarge The former Dino's Italian Restaurant at 4252 S. Howell Ave. The price for the 3,060-square-foot Howell Avenue building is $38,500 and Feto is planning to pump $100,000 in renovations and repairs into the facility, which has a defective sewer lateral and has experienced considerable deferred maintenance over the years, according to documents. An interior build-out of the dining spot is among the planned improvements. The restaurant — which is seeking a Class B liquor license so diners may order a drink with their meals— will serve pizza, Italian cuisine, seafood, chicken dinners and Greek specials. Marsel's Pizzeria will be open from 11 a.m. to midnight, according to city documents. Marsel's Pizzeria in Greenfield is located at 6131 W. Cold Spring Road. The Milwaukee Business Journal could not reach Feto by the time this story was published.
