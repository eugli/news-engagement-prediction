Already taking home a win at the Costume Designers Guild Awards earlier this week, the film's costume designer, Mary Zophres , is nominated for Best Costume Design at the Oscars, just one of the musical's impressive 14 nominations . And while Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's performances were nothing short of amazing, mixed with Damien Chazelle's direction, a catchy soundtrack and dreamy cinematography, fans haven't been able to stop gushing over the stunning, elegant ensembles displayed onscreen -- Stone's, specifically. Now, ET's breaking down our favorite celebrity looks, inspired by La La Land . Stone's Style Statement: Making Yellow Trendy Again! Photo: Getty/Lionsgate The bright yellow floral dress Stone's character, Mia, wore while dancing with Gosling (Sebastian) atop Los Angeles' Griffith Park, unsurprisingly became one of the most iconic costumes from the movie. Ever since its debut on Dec. 25, 2016, the red-headed beauty hasn't been shy about rocking the vivid hue. She wore an almost identical version of the frock to a Golden Globes pre-party , and opted for mustard yellow look at her and Gosling's hand and footprint ceremony at Grauman's Chinese Theatre. It may not be spring just yet, but Stone (and her character!) prove yellow can be worn year round. Lovely in Yellow Photo: Instagram/Getty And now, all the lovely ladies of Hollywood are following suit! Just this week, This Is Us star Mandy Moore donned a long-sleeved Victoria Beckham number, complete with black heels and a punchy red pout. Actress Halston Sage recently paired her yellow dress with metallic heels for a Dior beauty event, while Fences star Viola Davis shined on the Golden Globes red carpet . At the SAG Awards, Salma Hayek gave us major Mia vibes in an eclectic yellow Gucci gown, which featured pops of pink. Flowy Blue Dresses With Strappy Open-Toed Shoes Photo: Getty/Lionsgate Who could possibly forget the scene where Mia's gal pals talk her into getting all glammed up for a night on the town? While all the actresses were dressed in shades of jewel tones, Stone's cobalt blue knee-length dress, which featured a sheer overlay, was the sure standout. Blake Lively was inspired by the classy look while supporting her husband, Ryan Reynolds, at his Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony, and Sarah Jessica Parker was even more spot on when she wore a similar dress and metallic blue heels while out and about in New York City. A Pretty Purple Dress Paired With Pointed Toe Stilettos Photo: Getty/Twitter Emma Roberts could totally pass for a blonde version of Mia in this feminine ensemble, which reminded us of the royal purple number Stone wore in another romantic scene with Gosling. While Stone's footwear featured an iridescent color, the Scream Queens star opted for classic black ankle-strap pumps. Pure Elegance Photo: Getty/Lionsgate Most of the dresses Stone wore in La La Land featured jewel tones, but there were a few classic numbers that didn't need a flashy color to make a statement, like this white one, a gorgeous off-the-shoulder dress which was paired with silver heels. Arrival star Amy Adams put her own unique take on the look for the BAFTA nominees party in London, England, styling her dress with a black-and-white clutch and strappy stilettos. \"I do love the yellow dress, but I think that my very favorite dress, which has been a surprise for everybody, is the white dress that Emma wears in the Paris backdrop,\" Zophres told ET on Tuesday. \"It's everything I wanted it be. It sort of floats on air, and it makes me cry when I see that dress on film. Everyone's surprised by that answer because the movie is so known for its color, and that dress is white, but I love that dress.\" Sexy and Sophisticated Photo: AKM-GSI/Getty Maisie Williams seemingly took a style cue from Mia when getting dressed for EW's SAG Awards Pre-Party. The Game of Thrones star styled her strappy black dress, cut right above the knee, with a rectangular clutch and black heels, very similar to the classy ensemble Stone dons in one of the final scenes from the movie. A Delightful Dress for the Ones Who Dream Photo: Getty/Lionsgate Gorgeous in green! As fans of the film may recall, Mia wore an emerald green dress to meet Sebastian for movie night, which was arguably Stone's second most iconic look from the movie. Alexa PenaVega sported a similar olive green version of the costume to the Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour, while Lily Collins adapted the look with a floor-length frock, which featured a tiered skirt and crossover bodice, for the Producer's Guild Awards. Chic and Sweet Photo: Getty/Lionsgate The coral shirtdress Mia sported while walking around Los Angeles with Sebastian was the perfect mix of comfy and chic for a casual date night. Country singer Jessie James Decker was seemingly inspired by the dress' hue, as she rocked a ruffled, off-the-shoulder version to a fashion event in New York City. And actress Greer Grammar appears to have pulled style inspo from two of Mia's looks -- this coral number, as well as the sheer overlay featured on Stone's blue dress -- while choosing an outfit for HFPPA and InStyle's annual Miss Golden Globes party. Perfect Party Theme Photo: Getty Images Although all the aforementioned celebs looked fabulous in their La La Land inspired looks, no one did it better than Nina Dobrev, who celebrated her 28th birthday with a party set to the musical's theme. The Vampire Diaries star donned a baby blue dress, while Julianne Hough went with lush yellow and Lauren Paul sported bright red. Others in attendance included Kenny Jamez, Samantha Marq, Aaron Paul, Riawna Capri, Morgan Beau and Derek Hough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:02:16.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
