People were looking for some sensation‚ so I gave it to them and warmed them up‚” Erasmus told HeraldLIVE. \nHe recently made headlines after the SPCA took him to task over the poor state of “rescued” horses at his horse ranch‚ Featherfoot Farm. \nErasmus‚ who said he was the victim of a personal vendetta and unjust treatment by the SPCA‚ said he had taken his new horse “for some beer” and to show him off to friends at the Grand Prix bar‚ before he decided to go to a liquor store – where he was not that warmly received – before going on into the supermarket. \nResidents of the small coastal town recognised him from the cellphone footage filmed by other shoppers - and were not complimentary about the exploit. \nSuzanne Kruger‚ who works at Animals in Need according to her Facebook page‚ shared the video and commented: \"I have no idea what this guy was thinking (John Wanye's brother i think).... these tiles are sooo slippery and to ride with a horse in Spar.... lucky it turned out alright....\" \nElmien Geldenhuys agreed‚ saying: \"...That horse could slip! And looks scared!!!\" \n\"This man should NOT have horses‚ or dogs or anything that breathes. eish!\" \nThe locals were clearly aware of the SPCA action‚ with several commenting on the farm and one posting: \"Well‚ I guess Featherfoot doesn't need any more bad publicity‚ they're doing a good job all by themselves??\". \nErasmus has no regrets about the incident‚ he told HeraldLIVE. \n“At least he had manners and he did not mess in the store.” \nHe won an endorsement from shopper Lisa Sipika. \n“The incident really made my day – in fact‚ it has already made my year‚\" she said. \n“Who would ever have thought they would see a horse in a shop? It was a fun experience.” \nThis story originally appeared on HeraldLIVE Share Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
