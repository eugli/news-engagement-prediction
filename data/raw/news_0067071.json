For some time before that, Lee had forced Ms Elsie to go to a Catholic church for exorcism and made her carry a bible in a bulky waist pouch which she wore even at work. \nThe couple had started living together in June 2011, 2 months after they met online. Lee was then undergoing divorce proceedings with his wife. \nIn December 2011, Lee started to believe that his rented room was haunted and that his fiancee was possessed. \nOn 30 March 2012, Lee gave his wife a shower in the kitchen bathroom at about 6PM. A housemate heard Lee groaning and loud conversation between the couple. When he returned home, the couple were still in the bathroom.

When the couple went to their room, loud groaning noises could be heard until 11.08PM, after which one of the tenants dialed for the police. \nWhen officers arrived at 11.17PM and knocked on Lee's door, Lee opened the door and said that he had a quarrel with Ms Lie. Ms Lie appeared to be weak and lying on the mattress on a floor, but told officers she was just weak from a recent abortion. \nWhen the first two officers left at about 11.40PM, Lee continued to make loud groaning and shouting noises in the room. \nBy 6.30AM, tenants awoke to a horrible sight of blood seeping from the door of the couple's room. The police were again called in. \nA paramedic who arrived found Ms Lie topless and covered in blood lying on top of Lee, who was naked, on the mattress. The paramedic could not perform any emergency life saving procedures as he assessed the situation was unsafe. \nRealizing that his game was up, Lee gouged out Ms Lie's eyes. Police officers arrived at 6.55AM and found Lee kneeling and chanting while holding a yellow object that resembled a cross. He ignored the officers' orders to stop and continued chanting. He was subdued and arrested by police shortly after. \nMs Lie's eyeballs and clumps of hair were recovered at the foot of their block. \nLee was jailed 10 years today after he pleaded guilty to culpable homicide. He was originally charged with murder but a psychiatric report found that he had a brief psychotic disorder. \nMs Lie's mother, Madam Chen Yoke Mooi, 54, blasted the judgement and cried inconsolably: \"My daughter died so horribly... 10 years for a life, it's too much, it's not fair,\" she told reporters in Mandarin.
