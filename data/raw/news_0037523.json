It’s all hands on deck for the Dingles – and Cain is giving the task of intervening as Adam and Paddy fail to keep Aaron from heading back to the pub before it’s time. Seriously guys, one job. (Picture: ITV) \nIn a wonderful throwback to many key moments in the Robron story, Aaron finds himself locked in a boot while Robert and the team put the final pieces in place. \nAs Robert opens the boot and invites his groom to marry him, what will happen next? \nYou can find out by tuning in to ITV on Monday 20th February at 7pm. \nCheck back on our soaps homepage on Sunday 19th February from 7am (we know, early rise on a Sunday!?) for brand new interviews, storyline gossip and maybe even a sneaky new picture or two.
