Here's her WhatsApp number Anushka Sharma has got a phone number registered in the name of her Phillauri character Shashi, and will interact with fans through WhatsApp. IndiaToday.in | Written by Samrudhi Ghosh A + A - \nGone are the days when film promotions were only about an actor giving a few interviews. The makers of Phillauri are the latest to join the bandwagon of out-of-the-box promotions. Anushka Sharma , who plays friendly spirit Shashi in the film, has got a phone number registered in the name of her character and will interact with fans through the messaging platform WhatsApp. \nShe will call her fans every week using the app's video calling feature. To directly chat with Anushka, one has to add Shashi's number 9867473178 to their WhatsApp contacts. Not just this, they will also get exclusive access to Phillauri's promotional content. \nIn a statement, Shikha Kapur, Chief Marketing Officer of Fox Star Studios said, \"The unique storyline of Phillauri where the lead actor plays a friendly spirit who cannot be seen by people, gives us the opportunity to create a campaign that is imaginative and differentiated with 'invisibility' taking centre stage as the unique proposition... What's up with Shashi is one such idea on WhatsApp where we tap into the reach of the chatting platform in the country (160 million monthly users) and encourage engagement with Shashi in a never been done before manner.\" \nAnshai Lal-directed Phillauri, which also stars Diljit Dosanjh and Suraj Sharma, will release on March 24.
