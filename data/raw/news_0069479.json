And while Philly wasn’t spared from the marinated ahi tuna craze, by late summer the city only had two stores with a primary focus on the fish dish (although a few more featured lone iterations of the dish on their menus). Come 2017, the trend is still rolling on — one more spot just for poke has already arrived ( Philly Poke ), in addition to it appearing on other new menus — not to mention the expansion of Poi Dog into a brick and mortar operation. These are the places you can pick it up. Poke Bowl Open since last May, this Northern Liberties spot was Philadelphia’s first dedicated poke stop. It partly subscribes to the Subway/Chipotle “add your own fillings” model, although four set house favorites are available, with tuna, salmon, and octopus, for those who want somebody else to make the decisions. 958 N 2nd Street, Philadelphia — open 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily (10 p.m. Friday and Saturday) Oishii Poke With a beefed-up (although not entirely Hawaiian) selection of what most poke stores label “proteins” (i.e. meat and meat substitutes), Oishii’s options include eel, chicken, crab, and boiled shrimp, beyond the classic ahi tuna. They also do “poke burritos”, although they’re closer in form to a very large sushi roll. 938 Arch Street, Philadelphia first floor (at the back) — open 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily (11 p.m. Friday and Saturday) PokeOno PokeOno Open since October, this is the Main Line’s sole dedicated poke slinger, started by a longtime surfer who wanted to bring the dish over from Hawaii. It doesn’t go as unnecessarily wild with the toppings, but there are a few interesting kicks available from wasabi peas to citrus ponzu dressing. 59 West Lancaster Avenue, Ardmore — open 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily (9 p.m. Thursday to Saturday) Philly Poke The newest addition to Philly’s poke scene, inside the brand new Chinatown Square food hall. There’s also some sushi and Hawaiian specialties like Spam musubi on offer, too. 1016 Race Street, Philadelphia (inside Chinatown Sq Food Hall) — open 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily (11 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 8 p.m. Sunday) Tradewinds This pan-Asia-Pacific BYOB opened in Chestnut Hill in January, from a pair who recently arrived in Philly from Maui. There’s three pokes available — two fish, one tofu, or you can sample all three in a trio. 8630 Germantown Avenue, Philadelphia — open lunch and dinner Tuesday to Sunday (brunch on Sunday) Poi Dog Poi Dog This all Hawaiian food truck has a vegan poke bowl, with small-batch tofu, alaea salt, Hawaiian ogo, sesame, and green onion — they’re also opening a storefront on S 21st Street very soon. Often at Love Park or Head House Square, but check their Facebook . Hai Street Kitchen At Liberty Place and King of Prussia mall (as well as via their food truck), Hai Street has three sweet ‘n’ spicy pokes, as well as a range of other not-quite-poke bowls on the menu. Cheu Noodle Bar The popular ramen seller now has a spicy tuna poke, complete with soy egg. They’re also expanding to a second location in the near future. 255 S 10th Street, Philadelphia — open 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. (11 p.m. Friday) weekdays, noon to 11 p.m. Saturday, noon to 10 p.m. Sunday Maya J Craig Wilson’s very international Manayunk restaurant has a tuna bowl on offer with avocado, cashews, roasted garlic, sesame, soy, lime, and chili. 4371 Main Street, Philadelphia — open 4 to 10 p.m. Tuesday to Sunday .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:50:01.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
