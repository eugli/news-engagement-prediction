Just before Super Bowl Greg Toppo , USATODAY 8:58 p.m. ET Feb. 5, 2017 A customer complaint tweeted Sunday after cable TV service was interrupted for customers in the Washington, D.C., area. (Photo: USA TODAY) \nWashington, D.C.-area Comcast cable TV customers saw their service go down at the worst possible moment of the year: just before Super Bowl LI began Sunday evening. \nCustomers in parts of Arlington and Alexandria, Va., just outside D.C., lost service just before 6 p.m. ET, about 40 minutes before kickoff. \nAimee N. Metrick, a regional Comcast spokeswoman, said \"unfortunate issues beyond our control\" resulted in two separate outages: one due to a fire at an Arlington mall and a second in Alexandria due to a fire on commercial power lines that burned fiber lines. \nMetrick said Comcast had \"multiple crews on site to repair services as quickly and safely as possible.\" \nThe number of customers affected was not specified, but those that took to Twitter were not amused. One, in Alexandria, said she was told her service was expected to be fixed by 10:20 p.m. “Perfect, just in time for the game. Oh wait...” \nAnother tweeted , all in caps, just after 7:15 p.m. EST: “COMCAST OUTAGE ON SUPERBOWL SUNDAY I WANT A REFUND!!!! WHAT AM I PAYING FOR?!?” \nFollow Greg Toppo on Twitter: @gtoppo Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2kDm3PC NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.
