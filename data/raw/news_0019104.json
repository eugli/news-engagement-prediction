(Mizzou Athletics photo) TownNews.com Content Exchange \nCOLUMBIA, MO. • The University of Missouri Board of Curators approved the hiring of an architect to design the south end zone facility for Memorial Stadium by a 5-1 vote during Thursday’s meeting on Mizzou’s campus. \nIn passing the measure, the board authorized design costs of $4.31 million that have already been raised by the athletics department through private donations. MU has set an initial budget of $96.7 million for the project. Athletics has raised nearly half that total through fundraising. MU is expected to seek the board’s approval for the total project in June. MU hopes to have the four-story facility and south end-zone reboot completed for the 2019 season. \nThe board approved MU to hire Populous, Inc., a Kansas City architectural firm, to design the facility. Populous has handled similar football facilities at Colorado, Kansas State and Oklahoma. \nPamela Quigg Henrickson (Jefferson City) was the only curator who voted against the measure. She didn’t voice any opinions about the proposal during the public discussion. \nIn discussing the measure, Curator Phillip Snowden of Kansas City noted that Mizzou has raised approximately $45 million for the project. MU athletics has planned to cover the balance of the costs through revenue bonds financed through the university. \nRyan Rapp, the UM System’s chief audit executive, formally introduced the measure before voting took place. \n“The project is important to MU athletics to remain competitive in the SEC,” Rapp said. “It’s an important part of the recruiting process. Additionally MU athletics is a self-sustaining operation that supports the campus. The success of MU athletics has a direct impact on MU’s ability to not only recruit student-athletes but helps the campus grow and maintain enrollments.” \nBy putting off the full project approval to this summer, Rapp described the athletics department’s approach as “a measured approach” that “allows us to better understand what our fiscal picture is going to look like going forward.” \n“It allows for further fundraising reducing the potential bonding needs for the project,” he added, “and will allow for further refinement of the costs of the project, including potential savings prior to the project being brought to the board for approval in June.” \nThe board is scheduled to next meet April 27-28 at Missouri S&T and again at Mizzou June 22-23. \n“If in fact we approve this, (athletics fundraising is) not slowing down,” Snowden said. “They’re going to continue to raise private dollars to add to the number as we go forward. That’s an important aspect to recognize what Jim Sterk and Brian White and his staff have been able to do in a very short period of time in regards to that. Some of you don’t know this. Football is really about 90 percent of the total budget of (athletics) out of about 100 million. They’re responsible for about 90. It literally pays for all the other athletics that go on at the university. And we compete at a very high level. I think (the facility) is something that’s needed to keep pace.” \nSterk, MU's athletics director, attended Thursday's voting session at Memorial Union on the MU campus. \nCurator John Phillips of Kansas City said he was reluctantly in favor of the project in light of the fiscal challenges the board faces. \n“I think it might be helpful to say a lot of us raise our eyebrows at the amount we devote to athletics, myself included,” he said. “But I’m convinced this particular project would benefit the entire university, particularly the MU campus. There’s such private support for it, it’s had to say no. So, I’m a reluctant yes I do appreciate in this time where we have restricted funds we can have a project that’s well-funded at this point privately. I think we have to explore it.” \nCurators Donald Cupps (Cassville), Maurice Graham (Clayton) and David Steelman (Rolla) also voted in favor of the proposal but did not speak during the public discussion. \nSTLtoday.com will have more on this story. \nDave Matter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:11:45.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
