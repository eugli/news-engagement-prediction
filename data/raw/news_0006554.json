After All? Melania Trump Has Picked a White House Decorator February 3, 2017 5:00 PM Photographed by Mario Testino, *Vogue*, February 2005 With Melania Trump living in New York, a swirl of speculation as to whether she will ever move in to the White House has surfaced . However, there is one clear indication of late that suggests that the First Lady does indeed intend to move into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Mrs. Trump has officially selected interior designer Tham Kannalikham as White House decorator. Traditionally, the First Lady selects an interior designer, whose primary focus is to revamp the First Family’s private quarters. The Obamas opted for well-known designer Michael S. Smith, who filled the residence with personal touches, as well as art by modern and contemporary artists such as Alma Thomas. And while it’s easy to imagine what a gilded Trump White House could look like , Kannalikham is known for a more streamlined aesthetic. The Laotian-American designer is the principal of her own firm, Kannalikham Designs , which puts an emphasis on client privacy. This reputation may have been part of Kannalikham’s initial appeal, but there is another reason why Melania Trump may have consciously chosen her for this commission. Kannalikham, a relatively unknown designer, previously worked at Ralph Lauren Home. Coincidently—or not—this dual identity mirrors Melania’s wardrobe choices for Inauguration weekend. The First Lady opted for a powder-blue look by Ralph Lauren to wear during President Trump’s swearing in, and then selected a series of outfits by lesser-known American designers to wear to the other scheduled events . As for whether First Lady Melania Trump will champion up-and-coming designers like former First Lady Michelle Obama? Only time will tell.
