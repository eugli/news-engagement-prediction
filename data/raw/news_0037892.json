Jong-nam, 45, was killed by two women who splashed his face with a chemical at the KLIA2 departure hall at about 9am on Monday as he was about to leave for Macau. <>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T15:48:16.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
