Topics: Donald Trump , Sweden , Twitter , Media News , News (Credit: AP) \nIn 2011, Curators of Sweden — a project administered through the Nordic country’s cultural institutions — had an idea. Each week, a different Twitter user would take over the country’s Twitter handle, @sweden, to show off the country’s multiplicity to the world. The rules are simple: You need an active Twitter account and, to either be a resident of Sweden or have Swedish citizenship abroad. Hate speech and promoting one’s personal brand are frowned upon. \nBut 22-year old Max Karlsson, the self-professed “nerd” and “fire starter” who’s running the country’s social media account can’t stop talking about President Donald Trump . \nIt started with Trump’s comments Saturday about “what’s happening last night in Sweden,” but continued when the president doubled down on his claims about the Swedish crime rate. \n\nWhen Karlsson took over @sweden Monday, he wasted no time dispelling Trump’s alternative facts. We have around 100 murders per year. Thats like two days in the US. Two. Days. \n— @sweden / Max (@sweden) February 20, 2017 \nDuring the time Sweden received 250.000 refugees, unemployment has fallen with 1,2%-points. https://t.co/aZkMfoeOUc — @sweden / Max (@sweden) February 20, 2017 Hey Don, this is @Sweden speaking! It’s nice of you to care, really, but don’t fall for the hype.
