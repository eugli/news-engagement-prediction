He did not respond when a reporter shouted a question to him from outside the fence of the police station. \nThe car, an MPV, left the station half an hour later. \nReporters had rushed to the car hoping to get comments from the embassy staff. The car drove off without stopping. \nNorth Korean embassy officials have protested at the way the murder of Kim Jong-nam has been handled. Jong-nam, half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was assassinated at KLIA2 on Feb 13.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:33:08.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
