If you've got that, you've got a re-book status.\" \nHe said the policy helped to avoid issues with large numbers of people turning up at the camp on the same day. \n\"We'd have queues right down the road if everyone came in on a Saturday.\" \nThe move has seen some families, who have enjoyed holidaying at Kaiteriteri for decades, lose their priority status. \nPeople like Annette McKenzie, of Wakefield, who has stayed at the motor camp on the same days for 23 years, have now been told that they don't qualify for \"priority re-book\". She said the problem was that while she came on the same days each year — from late January to early February — the dates were always slightly different. \n\"I just think it's unfair. After 23 years, how can you not be classed as a loyal customer?\" she said. \n\"We won't be returning and I can name a lot that are thinking about the same thing who have been going for years.\" \nMcKenzie, 57, said she had been camping at Kaiteriteri since she was 17. She and her husband started bringing their youngest son when he was just three months old. \nShe said the motor camp was \"alienating\" loyal customers, and she would be holidaying over in Pohara in Golden Bay next summer. \nRoss said, under the Reserves Act, the board's directive was to safeguard Kaiteriteri Reserve for the enjoyment of New Zealand families. \n\"We want to be open to as many people as possible. There are so many who can't get in here because, I guess, to a degree it's locked up by families.\" \nPetch said the same site, same dates re-book policy was \"industry standard\" in New Zealand. \nSome campgrounds, like Totaranui in Abel Tasman National Park and Momorangi in the Marlborough Sounds, had scrapped re-booking altogether. \nLast summer, the board stopped the \"priority re-book\" policy for new people, but have allowed existing priority customers to continue. \nPetch said he \"absolutely\" sympathised with McKenzie and others in her situation. \n\"They've still got a chance of actually getting back in.\" \nPeople like McKenzie were able to apply for a site in May on a \"first in, first served\" basis. \nHowever, with 95 per cent of the motor camp already taken by \"priority re-book\" customers, there will be strong demand for the limited remaining sites. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:38:32.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
