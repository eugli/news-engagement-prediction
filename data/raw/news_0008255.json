They needed the next great Bulldog ball carrier. \nAll signs point to D'Andre Swift being that guy. Swift and fellow Pennsylvanian Mark Webb were the first to send in their National Letters of Intent on Wednesday, giving UGA coaches the ability to discuss them publicly. When Georgia offensive coordinator Jim Chaney was asked about him, he didn't hold back. (Photo: Tony Morano, 247Sports) \n“His ball skills are unbelievable as far as a running back goes,\" Chaney said of Swift. \"His ability to detach (move out of the box) and do things that other can’t do at that position will be fun to utilize as we watch him grow in our offense. I can’t wait to get him in here this summer and see what he can do.\" \nIt's tough to fault the long-time assistant. There's a lot to like about the nation's 33rd overall prospect according to the industry-generated 247Sports Composite. He had an incredible week of practice at the U.S. Army All-American game and played well in the game. \nHe was also the MVP of the North American Championship just last weekend with over 100 yards rushing and a pair of scores.

You bring him to a camp, he’s going to compete. He’s not going to be a five-star kid out there watching. So you absolutely love his competitive spirit. He comes from that. Mom and dad are that way. He’s that way. So I love that. He’s walking into the door expecting to play and is probably going to try and do it.” \nWhile the likelihood is high that Swift, at worst, has a rock-solid UGA career, it won't be easy to see the field early on. Chubb and Michel stand in his way as do talented rising sophomores Brian Herrien and Elijah Holyfield . \nBut as Chaney said, there are things the 5-foot-9, 220-pound playmaker can do that most tailbacks can't. But before he does any of that, he'll have the challenge of moving over 700 miles away from home and into a completely different climate. \n\"It’ll be fun to watch them play,\" Chaney said with a laugh. \"They’ll enjoy this Georgia heat that first month.” \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
