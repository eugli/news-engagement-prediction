After some environmental cleanup (of the fallout), the forest moon would return to its idyllic state,' she told Tech Insider. Disney/Lucasfilm Responses after that, however, were grim. Disney/Lucasfilm Matija Cuk, who studies orbital dynamics, said the Death Star's reactor blows up the artificial satellite in about 1 second. This would eject huge chunks of debris at 220,000 mph, or six times faster than humanity's speediest spacecraft. Disney/Lucasfilm \nSource: SETI 'The energy carried by the debris would not be enough to destroy the moon,' Cuk told Tech Insider, 'but it would heavily erode the side facing the Death Star.' Disney/Lucasfilm The high-speed chunks would obliterate '(a)ll ships close to the Death Star, imperial or rebel,' Cuk said. 'This is particularly true for Millennium Falcon and Luke's shuttle' -- both would be goners. Disney/Lucasfilm 'Since the rebels on the Forest Moon are just underneath (the Death Star) ... I suspect that they would be dead from radiation released by the explosion before the debris even reaches them,' he said. Disney/Lucasfilm After the radiation bath, high-speed debris would hit the ground, throwing rocks to the far side of the moon. 'Extinction of (the) Ewoks appears inevitable,' Cuk concluded. Disney/Lucasfilm Planetary physicist Erik Asphaug, who studies giant impacts with moons and planets, refused to believe most of the Death Star would vaporise or turn into tiny bits upon exploding. Disney/Lucasfilm 'Nuclear explosions in rock tend to vaporise the stuff nearby, melt the stuff a bit further away, and then break stuff farther away mechanically. The farther away, the less broken the bits become,' Asphaug told Tech Insider. Public domain 'So, I predict there will be huge chunks of the Death Star raining down on the Ewoks that might make their life unpleasant,' he said -- plenty big enough to reach the ground and make craters. Yet Asphaug said the biggest problem for the Ewoks on a dense forest moon might be fire. EPA/Noah Berger 'If thousands of wildfires go off at once, even if limited to one half of the planet, much of the surface will be a charred ruin,' he said. 'Their parties and celebrations will quickly change into emergency procedures to survive what could be a horrible nightmare.' Disney/Lucasfilm The white paper is based on a detailed, to-scale hologram projected in 'Return of the Jedi.' Disney/Lucasfilm From that image, Minton used physics equations to extrapolate diameters, masses, velocities, and orbital paths of Endor and the Death Star. Disney/Lucasfilm 'I estimate that the bulk density of Endor is about 14,350 kg/m3,' he told Tech Insider. 'This is more than iron (8000 kg/m3) and less than uranium (19,100 kg/m3), so while the composition of Endor must be quite unusual, it is not impossible.' Minton figured out that the Death Star is in a bizarrely stable orbit, since it's too near the moon and moving too slowly. Disney/Lucasfilm 'So I have to assume that the Death Star is being maintained in its position using something like (anti-gravity) repulsorlifts,' he wrote. Disney/Lucasfilm When the rebels and Ewoks destroy the shield generator on Endor -- a device that protected the Death Star -- Minton assumes the repulsorlifts there got destroyed, too. Disney/Lucasfilm He also assumes, like Asphaug, that the Death Star is not vaporized and mostly shatters into a field of loose rubble.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:05:55.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
