Although only a snippet is shown, the girls already look confused out of their minds as they try to figure out their formations. \nIt doesn’t stop there, as they also let loose later on while dancing to songs by BIGBANG and TWICE, as well as show off cute antics that are both adorable and cringeworthy at the same time. \nMeanwhile, Lovelyz will be making a comeback on February 26, with their second regular album “R U Ready?,” although member Yein may possibly have to sit out their promotions. \nWatch the preview below and stay tuned for when it airs on March 1!
