Xavier Christopher attacked staff whilst wearing a balaclava \nIt left two staff needing hospital treatment and Christopher sent to a segregation block. \nBut last week officers learned of plans to move the dangerous con back to a standard wing at Feltham Young Offenders’ Institute, West London. \nAnd they were stunned when they were handed a string of staggering “do’s and don’ts” in readiness for his return. \nAmong them were orders not to “stare at him or hold eye contact for too long”. Getty Images 4 Christopher fashioned the balaclava out of a t-shirt, and hospitalised two wardens during an assault \nAnd they were warned not to be “forceful or overly authoritative” or call him “dangerous” while he was in earshot. \nFemale officers have also been asked to “take more of a lead” with Christopher because he “engages better” with women. \nBut the advice has sparked fury among staff dealing with the thug, who is serving eight years for torturing his victim by carving letters into his arm with a knife. \nIncredibly, staff were also warned they should not take away Christopher’s mask when he returns to the wing. \nSources said experts suggested the policy because they fear Christopher would get upset and make ANOTHER if officers seized it. PA:Press Association 4 Now staff at Feltham Young Offenders’ Institute have been told they should allow him to keep it \nInstead he must keep it in an “agreed location” in his cell while staff must try to be “collaborative and supportive” at all times. \nOne source told The Sun: “Part of a prison officer’s job is to help rehabilitate prisoners – it is not to appease them.” \nIt is understood the plan is yet to be rubber-stamped and could yet be ditched when officials meet next week to discuss Christopher’s future. Shocking videos of prisoners in UK jails being punched and tortured \nHe has been in segregation since December 17, when he launched his attack. \nIt eventually took a further six officers to bring him under control. \nrelated stories IT'S LAG-ON-LAG Time added on to prisoners' sentences for attacking each other more than doubles in five years 'I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT' Cop relives the dramatic moment he found Shannon Matthews tied up under bed 'FINISH HIM BLUD' Shocking moment lag knocks out fellow inmate during prison fight club as baying mob of prisoners egg them on in LAG DEATH PROBE Investigation launched after death of prisoner at Category B Manchester prison 'GOD, PLEASE HELP ME' Epileptic prisoner wrote plea for help on cell walls in own blood 'after being raped by guards' THE BRIT FRITZL The disgusting ‘hidey-hole’ behind a fridge guarded by Alsatians where monster held runaway teen captive so he could repeatedly rape her lags to riches 4 Chairman of the Prison Officers' Association Mike Rolfe hit out at the decision \nMike Rolfe, Chairman of the Prison Officers' Association, blasted: \"Ensuring good discipline is instilled into every custodial environment is essential to maintaining a safe and decent workplace. \n\"Allowing prisoners to keep instruments of crime and terror such as masks undermines the basic principles of security and control and makes the job of a prison officer almost impossible, not to mention damages the credibility of the Prison Service as a whole.\" \nThe Prison Service declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:17:52.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
