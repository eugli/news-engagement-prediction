Getty Images 7 Mark Hughes has accused Baggies of leaking Saido Berahino’s drug ban \nHe said: “They were able to keep it under wraps discreetly for six or seven months and lo and behold, just before a game against his new club, it comes out. Keep up to date with ALL the Stoke news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \n“It is shame because people would suggest West Brom had something to do with that… \n“That would be an unfair thing to happen, wouldn’t it? \n“I could get myself into trouble.” \nHughes is still seething that West Brom failed to tell Stoke about Berahino’s drugs problem at the start of negotiations over his £12million transfer last month — despite Potters boss Pulis’ claim his club were “open and honest”. PA:Press Association The Stoke boss hinted West Brom intentionally leaked it before their match West Brom 1-0 Stoke City : James Morrison early strike is enough to clinch three points Getty Images Berahino has already served his eight-game ban for recreational drug use PA:Press Association 7 Berahino lined up against his former side on his second Stoke appearance \nAnd Welshman Hughes also had a dig at Pulis for failing to shake hands before or after yesterday’s game, which West Brom won 1-0. \nBerahino, 23, failed to make an impact as a 58th-minute substitution and Hughes is still angry they discovered about the player’s problems from his advisors. \nHughes added: “We weren’t told by West Brom about it, in fairness. Not at all. \n“There was talk West Brom had made us fully aware but they didn’t. We knew the situation anyway. We told them we knew.” Getty Images 7 Hughes insists West Brom did not clearly inform Stoke about the ban \nPulis refused to talk to the media after a tetchy game, which saw Hawthorns stewards forced to separate warring rival fans. \nHughes added: “I didn’t see him to shake hands. I was on the touchline some time at the end. \n“He didn’t shake my hand before the game, either. \n“I would have thought he might have come and welcomed me but for some reason he didn’t want to. \n“Maybe he does not like shaking hands. With most managers you have disagreements during games but usually after you have a beer.
