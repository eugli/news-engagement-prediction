Credit: AP \nHuman rights lawyers are seeking to put Australia on trial for crimes against humanity over the treatment of refugees at its UN-condemned offshore detention camps. \nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague has been asked to examine the use of the camps on Pacific islands Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus after receiving harrowing accounts. \nHundreds of men, women and children are detained indeterminately on the islands after arriving in Australia by boat without a visa and seeking asylum. \nThe International Human Rights Clinic at the Stanford Law School in the US and the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN) detailed a decade of worsening conditions in a 100-page submission to the ICC. Refugees are forced to remain on the island camps, which are run by private companies. Credit: AP \nThey allege self-harm is at epidemic proportions at the camps. One man who died by self-immolation in April last year while a woman suffered 70% burns days later after setting herself on fire. \nReports on conditions on the islands, which were leaked last year , also claimed seven child sexual assaults and 59 physical assaults had taken place. 390 Men, women and children detained on Nauru. 872 Men, women and children detained on Manus. \nAround 390 people, including 45 children, remain detained on Nauru and 872 on Manus, about 3,000km (1,864 miles) and 1,000km (621 miles) from Australia respectively. \nHundreds of others who were sent to the islands since 2008 are no longer in formal detention but have been forced to remain on the islands. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull received an angry response from Donald Trump over a deal for the US to resettle refugees in Pacific island camps. Credit: AP \nThe asylum seekers are told they will not be settling in Australia but are not offered any other viable resettlement alternative. \nDr Ioannis Kalpouzos, lecturer at City Law School, University of London and GLAN chairman, said: \"We are witnessing the normalisation of crimes committed against the world's most vulnerable population - refugees. It is a physical and mental suffering they are going through.\" \nThe United Nations and human rights groups including Amnesty International have condemned the use of the islands, where private companies run the detention camps. \nAustralia last year made a commitment to close the detention centre on Manus island.
