High-School Throwback. \nMarkle’s yearbook picture was circulated widely last week, after news of her relationship with Harry broke. Meanwhile, Kate (who is one year younger than Markle) was probably about the same age, when this shot was taken. (The way Kate has that jacket draped casually across her back is downright inspirational.) Photo: Left, From Seth Poppel/Yearbook Library; right, By Stephen Lock/Rex/Shutterstock. Life’s a Stage. \nMarkle is most famous for her role on Suits as lawyer Rachel Zane (viewership for the next season of the show promises to increase by at least 200 percent, right?). Kate, you may be surprised to learn, once hit the stage, as well, performing in a school production of My Fair Lady at age 11. Photo: Left, From Getty Images. Blazing Ahead. \n“Oh hi, we both look more effortlessly glam in a blazer than you will ever look in anything your entire life.” Photo: Left, By Ray Tamarra/GC Images/Getty Images; right, By Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images. Compliments to the Chef. \nMarkle has a lifestyle blog, the Tig, and is a cooking obsessive (she listed a number of culinary types—plus Gwyneth Paltrow —when asked whom she’d invite to her dream dinner). And Kate may not love cooking, per se (William once said her cooking was the reason he was “so skinny”), but you wouldn’t know it from her glee at donning this chef’s outfit.

Seeing Red. \nYou just know Us Weekly is going to be publishing these two looks side by side for an upcoming “Who Wore It Best?” Photo: Left, by Ray Tamarra/GC Images; right, by Pool/Sam Hussein/WireImage. On the Court. \nAt some point soon, it seems safe to bet Kate and Meghan will have to play a mixed doubles tennis match with Harry and William, no? (“I finally have a partner to play with,” Harry will joke, as, all the while, George will sit on a small throne “officiating” on the side of the court.)

These two seem destined to get along famously—and perhaps will soon be re-creating these similar expressions, over the holidays, when Prince Charles decides to stand up and sing an impromptu carol for everyone.
