We’re not young and free.\n“My people are still being oppressed. Nothing’s changed ... the anthem isn’t right. It’s not for all of Australia. I just can’t stand up for something I don’t believe in.”\nWhile Thompson said he understood both sides of the argument, he declared “it is time for us as a nation to unite and come together”.\nThompson did not want to comment on whether the anthem should change.\n“That is someone else’s decision,” he said.\nmedia_camera Joel Thompson understands both sides of the national anthem argument\n“I respect everyone’s opinion. I think it is time for us as a nation to unite and come together. There is so much divide across Australia.\n“I can understand where Choc is coming from and I respect his opinion. I can definitely understand what he is talking about.\n“If people actually did research into the song and when the song was written, people are still hurt by what happened. But everyone has their own opinion on it.\n“I think it is time that we stand together and make some decisions where we can unite.\n“I respect the anthem and what it represents for me as a person. For the people who have served our country and the people who have died for us as a nation. I understand both sides.”\nmedia_camera The NRL World All Stars and NRL indigenous All Stars during a team photo in Sydney.

I think it is time to fight all the issues as one.”\nHe said to be selected in the Indigenous All Stars “means a lot”.\n“Not just to me but my family and what it represents,” he said.\nMeanwhile, Canberra’s Jarrod Croker, Gold Coast’s Chris McQueen and Cronulla’s Gerard Beale have been called into the World All Stars squad.\nThe trio will replace Joseph Leilua, Jarryd Hayne and Sosaia Feki, who were ruled out through injury.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/49fe5ee596ce3a2ea628ac0f7754ac6b?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/e1267b99dffbf7134df6b795707eacd5?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/bea13eddb92c34098e3faf1089d586a8?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e8a35d6411bfefc9d3f40ed37d1d776a?width=650"], "published": "2017-02-06T01:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:49:29.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
