The January arrival lasted less than 20 minutes at the Vitality Stadium after appearing to roll his ankle during the match on the south coast. He did seem keen to continue but manager Pep Guardiola signalled for Sergio Aguero to warm up and he was then thrown into the fray. Aguero has lost his place in the starting XI to the Brazilian in recent weeks despite having scored 154 goals for the club during his time at the Etihad. “I would like him to remain but I don’t know what is going to happen,” City boss Guardiola said of Aguero before the game as rumours swirl the Argentine will leave the club. \n— Manchester City (@ManCity) February 13, 2017 “Even in my career I would not know what would happen at the end of the season, so I do not know. “My advice for all the players is, ‘ keep going, guys’. Keep going, fight and show me again how good you are.” The extent of Jesus’ injury is not yet known.
