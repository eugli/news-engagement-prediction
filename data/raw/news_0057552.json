In truth, the third-largest Canary Island is a fabulous destination. The capital Las Palmas offers elegant culture at its Centro Atlantico de Arte Moderno – but saves its best for the beach in the shape of Playa de las Canteras. While the rest of Europe wears a sweater in March, Gran Canaria dons shorts and t-shirt Credit: AP/FOTOLIA A five-night stay at the Sheraton Gran Canaria Salobre Golf Resort, in the south of the island near Maspalomas, costs from £549 per person via Inspired Luxury Escapes (0333 222 3222; telegraph.co.uk/tt-gran ). Essaouira \nWhere once, Morocco only really gleamed on the map – for British tourists at least – via the (admittedly alluring) souks of Marrakesh, now it can suggest Fes, Agadir and Tangier as accessible reasons to visit. And Essaouira. Pinned to the country’s Atlantic coast 110 miles west of Marrakesh, here is all the food and market frenzy you may expect of any Moroccan city – but also long beaches which are oases for surfers and windsurfers. Essaouira's beaches are oases for surfers, windsurfers and, of course, camels Credit: AP/FOTOLIA A seven-night stay at the Sofitel Essaouira Mogador Golf & Spa, offering a Gary Player-designed 18-hole golf course, costs from £745 for selected departures in March via Kuoni (0800 044 8581; kuoni.co.uk). Las Vegas \nIf you take the line that it doesn’t matter when you visit Sin City – for you will be locked in the casino trebling your life savings – then the temperature outside is irrelevant. But Nevada’s big beast is arguably near its best in March – not so hot that you cannot brave the poolside, not given over to the desert chill either. A brief flight away in Arizona, however, the more elevated Grand Canyon may be dusted with snow – which is all the more reason to visit one of the world’s greatest natural wonders. Vegas is arguably best visited during March, when temperatures are tolerable Credit: AP/FOTOLIA America As You Like It (020 8742 8299; americaasyoulikeit.com ) sells a 15-night “Bright Lights, National Parks & Deserts” road trip that visits California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona, including Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon, from £1,592 per person with flights included. 25-29C Adelaide \nWhat to make of South Australia’s capital? True, it cannot match Melbourne or Sydney for glamour, nor Perth for surfing beaches. But it rewards investigation – the waterfront districts of Glenelg and Semaphore, the wineries of the Barossa Valley, the wildlife-laden outcrop of Kangaroo Island, the calm seascapes of the Yorke Peninsula. It’s all wrapped in mid-20s Celsius warmth in March. Case closed. Intrepid Travel (0808 274 5111; intrepidtravel.com ) offers “Eyre Peninsula Overland” – a six-day group jaunt which covers much of South Australia, including Adelaide. From £483 per person (no flights) for departures on March 8 and 22. Dubai \nSometimes it is hard to imagine Dubai as it was barely more than a century ago – a fishing village gazing at the Persian Gulf. Certainly, it was a place far removed from the metropolis that beckons travellers today – its Atlantis The Palm and Burj Al Arab resorts smiling for the cameras. But then, if you come for the luxury to be found in both, or the reliable warmth outside, such back stories scarcely matter. The Persian Gulf laps upon the sultry shores of Dubai Credit: AP/FOTOLIA A three-night stay at the five-star Jumeirah Mina A’Salam hotel costs from £1,436 per person, including flights from Heathrow departing on March 6 or 13 via Kuoni (0800044 8581; kuoni.co.uk ) Florida \nYou know you can count on a destination for winter warmth when it goes under the nickname of “The Sunshine State”. Florida lives up to this boast in all areas of the calendar – and in all corners of what, with 1,350 miles of sandy flanks to its portfolio, is the portion of the United States with more coastline than any other, Alaska excepted. For all that, it can be difficult to resist Orlando, whose theme parks and hotels guarantee holiday fun. 'The Sunshine State' lives up to its name come March Credit: AP/FOTOLIA A seven-night break at the Reunion Resort Orlando – which offers self-catering options with four bedrooms – costs from £2,093 per villa (based on eight people sharing) in March via James Villas Holidays (0333 122 7429; telegraph.co.uk/tt-florida ). Cuba \nFor all its notoriety, at least in terms of the 20th century, it is sometimes forgotten that Cuba is big. The largest island in the Caribbean, it stretches from verdant Pinar del Rio in the west to historic Santiago in the south-east. So where to start in this country of 42,426 square miles? Certainly the crumbling, chaotic capital Havana – before the beach resorts of north-coast Varadero issue their loud siren call.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T12:52:53.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
