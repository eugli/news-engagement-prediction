(Youtube/Midwest Gardener)\nStore manager Jeff Scott said his shop sold about 25 packets of the seeds over \"two or three\" days, and that the store normally wouldn't sell any of the $1.89 gardening packets in February.\nScott told CBC News he became aware of the issue after a concerned parent phoned the store to tell him about the practice.\nAn employee confirmed all the customers who bought the morning glory seeds were teenagers and young adults.\n\"This is strange this time of year, so I looked further into morning glory seeds. We went online, and then we found out it can be used for other purposes that we … weren't too pleased with, so we notified the Renfrew OPP, and we pulled them off the shelf at this time,\" Scott said.\n'They may put themselves in danger' The seeds can be ingested or steeped in water to make tea in order to get a high, according to Renfrew OPP Const. Janice Sawbridge.\n\"I think young people may feel that a seed is a natural product, so maybe they think that's safer than consuming illegal drugs. But our concern is the fact that it causes hallucinations. And then, you know, they may put themselves in danger … something bad may happen when they're hallucinating,\" said Sawbridge.\n\"It can also cause extreme nausea — ingesting the seeds — because there's an outer coating on the seeds, apparently, that can cause extreme nauseousness,\" she said.\nSawbridge said so far she's not aware of any other reports of stores in the area selling an abundance of morning glory seeds.\nNeither Ottawa police nor Ottawa Public Health have received reports of people in this city abusing the seeds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:54:31.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
