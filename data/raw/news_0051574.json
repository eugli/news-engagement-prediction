However, it took one kilogram of plant bud to make one milligram of extract.\nPandey, along with his UWindsor research team of graduate and undergraduate students, partnered with researchers James McNulty from McMaster University and Tomas Hudlicky from Brock University.\nDr. Hudlicky synthesized and patented seven compound variations and the UWindsor laboratory team tested them on animals with tumours as well as 20 varieties of cancer cells, including breast, prostate, melanoma and bone.\nBy chemically synthesizing versions for this study, the researchers created a more potent cancer-killing compound.\nThese compounds are non-toxic because instead of targeting the protein tubulin or DNA, which are the same for cancerous and healthy cells, they target only the mitochondria of the cancer cells.\n“This is the first time we got a compound which can distinguish between cancer and normal cells,” Pandey says. He says the next step toward making a treatment available would be to have a company develop a clinical trial of the patented drug compounds.\nThe study’s results appear in Nature ’s online publication, Scientific Reports , in the article, Cancer Cell Mitochondria Targeting by Pancratistatin Analogs is Dependent on Functional Complex II and III .\nRelated Stories Dandelion root extract approved for clinical trials of cancer-fighting benefits", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:34:16.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
