He is definitely an option. But I will not tell you whether he fits into our scheme of things or not. Ideally when you take in a player, you bring him in with the understanding that he will be available for all games,” Gujarat Lions' CEO Harvinder Singh told New Indian Express. \nThe same report also quoted Pune Supergiants CEO Raghu Iyer saying, “If English players (and Ben Stokes is certainly one) make themselves available for the entirety of the tournament, they are bound to create a flutter or two.” \nBesides Stokes, Eoin Morgan, Jason Roy, Chris Jordan and Tymal Mills have also expressed their interests in IPL. \nYesterday, it's confirmed that the auction of 10th edition of IPL will be held in Bengaluru on February 20. Initially Feb 4 was confirmed as the auction date. \nA maximum of 76 players, including 28 overseas, will be available in the auction.
