It certainly makes Chaudhary persona non-grata as far as decision-making of the internal board matters are concerned. \nIt was around 12 noon Chaudhary was told that he has to wait as he is eligible to attend the meeting. It was Rahul Johri, the CEO who convened the meeting by video conferencing with skipper Virat Kohli joining from Bangalore via Skype. \n\"Amitabh Chaudhary had called a senior selection committee meeting in Delhi today to select the squad against Bangladesh. Vinod Rai and Co have immediately swung in and barred him from doing anything. The CEO is directly convening the meeting via video conference from Mumbai,\" a BCCI source, who was witness to every incident here, told PTI today. \nAll was not well was understood when BCCI mandarins broke for lunch with one of the selectors Sarandeep Singh was not even around. \nSome of the waiting media members were told that meeting will start at 3 pm but then around 3:30 pm Sarandeep was seen entering the hotel and looked clueless about when the meeting will start. \nAround 4 pm, he went up and joined his colleagues as the meeting was presumed to be started but at around 5: 30 pm, BCCI GM (Cricket Operations) MV Sridhar came down and said that they are still getting a few clarifications before starting at around 6 pm. \nToday's incident proved that Chaudhary probably is not authorised to function as joint secretary and will go to Dubai as BCCI representative only as he has a thorough background knowledge that investment banker Vikram Limaye will be needing for future meetings.
