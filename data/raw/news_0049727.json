By: FE Online | Updated: February 21, 2017 4:47 PM Allahabad West is constituency No. 261 of Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly. It comes under the Phulpur Lok Sabha constituency. It is an open constituency. (Source: PTI) \nThe third phase of voting in the politically crucial Uttar Pradesh ended on February 19 in 69 constituencies and as many as 826 candidates contested in this phase. The voting exercise were conducted at 12 districts during this phase and nearly 62 per cent voter turnaround was recorded by the end of the day. The key parties to watch out for during the elections are Samajwadi Party (SP), Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ), Congress , Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). Over the past few months, UP has witnessed some high-decibel rallies and roadshows where all major political parties have tried their best to lure voters. The ongoing polls are considered to be a crucial test for the ruling SP and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is leaving no stones unturned to retain his government. Looking at the current situation, Akhilesh has managed to build an image of ‘leader for youth’ and have gained a huge vote bank. His ‘kaam bolta hai’ campaign has gained a good response in rural as well as the urban areas of the state. But at the same time, there has been a little anger against him because of the law-and-order failure in the state. Yes, there is no ‘Modi wave’ like it was during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but the BJP, backing on its star campaigner PM Narendra Modi , has successfully managed to create a strong foothold in some particular casts and communities. BJP is largely betting upon its mission against corruption and black money that has well connected to the mass. The saffron party has blamed SP of acting as a roadblock to the development of the state for years. \nInterestingly, Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has emerged as a strong contender in this political run. But the party is still behind in terms of vote bank apart from some particular communities. Even the votes of Muslim community have gone to her in limited areas where the candidates fielded are very strong. With such high voter turnout in all the three phases of the polls so far, it clearly indicates that the electorate is turning out to vote to effect a major change. \nAllahabad West is constituency No. 261 of Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly. It belongs to Allahabad district which is situated in Upper Doab region of the state. It comes under the Phulpur Lok Sabha constituency. It is an open constituency. \nNumber of voters As per the election commission data, Allahabad West has 3,42,693 registered voters out of which 1,91,187 are male and 1,51,495 female registered voters. The constituency also has 11 voters in the Others category. \nWhat are the key issues Development and law-and-order are some major issues in this region. \nWho was the winner last time During the 2012 Assembly elections, BSP won this constituency by 8,885 votes. Pooja Pal from BSP bagged 71,114 votes followed by Atiq Ahamad of Apna Dal who got 62,229 votes. The total voter turnout was 51.74 per cent. \nYou might also want to see this: \nWho are the competing candidates Pooja Pal (BSP), Richa Singh (SP), Sidharth Nath Singh (BJP) and Sunil Kumar (RLD). \nWhy this constituency is important? The constituency has been one of the easiest bets for BSP as the party has secured it for 2 consecutive years so far. However, during the 2014 Lok Sabha election BJP buoyed by its performance by securing more than half of the total votes. This time the saffron party is expecting the same response here.
