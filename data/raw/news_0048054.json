But if that's the case, why not just let whiteboards be optional? If a student doesn't find them useful, or is worried about offensive messages, he can take his down.\nNo, no—they all must come down. There's too great a danger of someone saying something that someone else doesn't like, according to administrators. The Free Press 's article details the numerous strategies MSU deploys to prevent such an occurrence:\nThe university also has an anti-discrimination policy.\nStaff, including resident assistants inside buildings, file reports with MSU's Office of Institutional Equity when they come upon offensive language on whiteboards. That office investigates the issues when reported, through the people who write the offending words or images are rarely identified.\n\"Any student found in violation of the university's Anti-Discrimination Policy can face sanctions ranging from a warning to suspension,\" Ande Durojaiye, director of Office of Institutional Equity, wrote in an e-mail.\nHere's a theory: maybe the behavior of MSU students isn't worsening—maybe people aren't suddenly more prone to engage in harassment. Rather, the university has defined harassment in increasingly subjective terms, and encouraged members of campus to report each other anonymously. Students aren't abusing the whiteboards: administrators are abusing the students' free expression rights.\nIn such an environment, I'm sure it makes more sense for MSU to simply shut everyone up.\nPhoto Credit: Lovelac7", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:06:24.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
