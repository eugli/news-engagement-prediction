A former beauty queen, Aden first hit the radar of the fashion set when she competed for the title of Miss Minnesota USA wearing a burkini and a hijab—a first for the pageant world. But she’s really hit the style stratosphere this month with a string of major fashion gigs. Last week, she announced her contract with IMG Models (home of Gisele, Gigi and Bella Hadid, and Hari Nef, NBD) and walked in the Yeezy Season 5 show , making her official fashion week debut. Today, she's taken her runway dominance overseas with a surprise appearance at the Alberta Ferretti show at Milan fashion week.
