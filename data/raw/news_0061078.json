Don Huffines, next year's state elections could double your pleasure, or double your pain. \nHuffines' twin brother, Dallas businessman Phillip Huffines, is considering running for a soon-to-be vacant Collin County seat in the Texas Senate. \nSenate District 8 is currently represented by Plano Republican Van Taylor, who has said he's running for Congress to replace retiring Republican Sam Johnson . \nIf Johnson serves out his full term, Huffines could land on GOP ballots in the March 2018 primary. If Johnson leaves early, Taylor would run in a special election for that post, and Huffines could be a contender in a special election to replace Taylor. \n\"The whole dynamic is interesting,\" said conservative radio talk show host Mark Davis of KSKY-AM (660), who has heard the buzz that Huffines is considering a Senate run. \"He makes an instant impact the moment he decides to get in the race. The question: Is it the kind of impact that resonates in Collin County, where you could have two candidates who are already serving in the House?\" Rep. Jeff Leach, R-Plano.(Louis DeLuca/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer \nHuffines is chairman of the Dallas County Republican Party and is wrapped up with planning a Reagan Day Dinner fundraiser next month that will feature Donald Trump Jr. and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz. \nLast year when Huffines campaigned to lead the party, he promised not to run against incumbent Republicans , most notably U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions of Dallas. \nTaylor's departure would leave an open seat. \nSeveral veteran contenders are expected to tussle to replace Taylor, including state Reps. Jeff Leach and Matt Shaheen of Plano. Both candidates are familiar to Collin County voters and the county's Republican network. They are considered conservatives in touch with the latest incarnation of Texas Republicans that's heavily influenced by tea party activists and other movement conservatives. State Rep. Matt Shaheen, R-Plano. \nIf he gets into the race, Huffines would boast high name recognition, thanks to his car dealer brother, Ray Huffines. He'll have to move into the district; just a small part of it is in Dallas County. And he should expect carpetbagger charges from rivals, even though his family has business interests there.

John Corona, a Huffines can raise considerable campaign cash. Those resources would be guided by Jeff Roe and the team of consultants that propelled Don Huffines to his upset victory over Carona. \nIt was a brutal campaign. Early in the contest Huffines scrapped as if he was in an alley fight, while Carona's team was serving up ice cream and cake. \nA competitive Collin County contest featuring Huffines would be one to watch. Heck, just competition would be out of the ordinary for Collin County. The last two men to hold the District 66 Senate seat, Taylor and Ken Paxton (now the attorney general), ran unopposed. \nUnshackled from the fringes of the GOP, the Huffines brothers are libertarians who want to shake up government. It isn't always pretty. \nDuring his first legislative session, Don Huffines alienated members of his own party with his aggressive style. \nUndaunted, he returned this year with a full legislative agenda. It includes abolishing the mismanaged bus service confusingly called Dallas County Schools. He also wants to end unnecessary or questionable asset seizures by law enforcement officials. \nOn Tuesday, Huffines introduced a resolution calling for congressional term limits. He also has legislation that would create term limits in the Legislature, where some members serve for 40-plus years. \nTwin brothers have never served together in the Senate. Phillip Huffines, as a senator, would be a partner in Don Huffines' drive to transform government â to the delight of libertarians and the horror of Democrats.
