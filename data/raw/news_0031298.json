The hollers are louder due to the Wolfpack losing their fifth straight game, an 88-58 disassembling at the hands of Wake Forest (15-10). \nNC State is 14-12 with a 3-10 ACC record. The loss was State's third of the year by at least 25 points. \nThe Wolfpack haven't won since their shocker of a road upset at Duke on Jan. 23. An NCAA Tournament at-large bid is off the table, and the Wolfpack are collapsing into the reality of being quite possibly the most disappointing team in college basketball this season. \nWhen asked about his future with the program and calls for his job, NC State coach Mark Gottfried didn't give credence to the outside noise, and added that his status as coach has not been addressed directly to him by anyone at NC State. \n\"Truthfully, I'm not paying attention to any of that,\" Gottfried told CBS Sports. \"I haven't had any discussions with anyone at NC State about that. I plan on being here for a long time.\" \nGottfried is in his sixth season in Raleigh. The team was 16-17 a season ago, but Gottfried did make four consecutive NCAA Tournaments prior to that. His record at the school is 122-81. The Wolfpack had high expectations this season, due in good portion to having freshman point guard Dennis Smith Jr. , who is projected by most as a top-five NBA Draft pick this June. \nSmith finished with 17 points, three assists, three fouls, four turnovers and no steals against Wake Forest. \nGottfried said the team has lost its poise since the Duke win. \n\"I don't think it's just one thing; it'd be nice if it was just one thing to fix,\" Gottfried told CBS Sports. \"Defensively we've been really good -- at times. At times we lose our poise, whether it's our rotations or getting to somebody on the break, our transition defense ... it's always something. That's probably hurt us more than anything. But today, our offense not scoring early, we were not being very productive offensively and that affected our defense. We got down, down on ourselves quick. That's where the lack of poise comes in.\" \nState has allowed 91.1 points in its 12 losses, and only one of the opponents -- Boston College (9-16) -- failed to crack the 80-point barrier. NC State ranks 218th at KenPom.com in defensive efficiency. \n\"There's no easy way to get out of the hole,\" Gottfried said. \"It's going to be difficult because of who we play. That's just life in the ACC right now.\" \nState's next game is Wednesday at home against North Carolina . On Jan. 8, UNC defeated NC State 107-56, signaling one of the biggest margins of victory/defeat in the history of the conference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:32:28.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
