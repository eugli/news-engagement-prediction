PUBLISHED: 22:02,  19, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 TWITTER Ronald Fiddler, known as Abu Zakariya al-Britani \nThe depraved terror group released a photo of what is is believed to be Ronald Fiddler, known as Abu Zakariya al-Britani , who detonated a car bomb at an Iraqi army base near the Iraqi city of Mosul. \nIt has now emerged that his release from the American detention was secured in 2004 by the then-Home Secretary David Blunkett. \nFiddler, also known as Jamul-Uddin al-Harith, was reportedly handed £1million in compensation on his return to the UK from the infamous detention centre.

BBC journalist Steve Swann has now claimed he is the Mosul suicide bomber. \nIt comes after ISIS released a statement saying al-Britani had carried out an attack in Mosul. The BBC said it had seen ISIS registration papers signed by Fiddler in April 2014. \nChilling footage shows a group explosive-laden death car as they drive towards an Iraqi forces base in the ISIS stronghold. Later, clouds of smoke can be seen for miles after the car drives off-screen. \nISIS later released a statement saying: “The martyrdom-seeking brother Abu Zakariya al-Britani — may Allah accept him — detonated his explosives-laden vehicle on a headquarters of the Rafidhi army and its militias in Tal Kisum village, southwest of Mosul.\" \nA Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, and against all travel to large parts of Iraq. \n\"As all UK consular services are suspended in Syria and greatly limited in Iraq, it is extremely difficult to confirm the whereabouts and status of British nationals in these areas.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:26:02.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
