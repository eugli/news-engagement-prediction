(Darryl Dyck / THE CANADIAN PRESS) The Canadian Press   10:59AM EST Last Updated Thursday, February 23, 2017 11:26AM EST \nOTTAWA -- The Supreme Court of Canada has granted Delta Air Lines leave to appeal a ruling that found a Halifax passenger rights advocate should be able to stand up for obese people even though he isn't overweight himself. \nThe court ruled today it would look at an earlier Federal Court of Appeal ruling involving Gabor Lukacs and a complaint he had originally filed to the Canadian Transportation Agency in 2014. \nThe complaint was over Delta's practice of bumping obese travellers or making them buy two seats on a plane, which Lukacs argued was discriminatory and should be banned. \nThe agency dismissed the complaint because it found that Lukacs had no private or public standing in the matter because he wasn't directly affected by it. \nThe appeal court disagreed in a ruling last September and ordered the agency to take another look at Delta's policy. \nThe Supreme Court of Canada only said that the leave to appeal was granted without costs.
