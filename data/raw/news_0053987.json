ADVERTISEMENT \nISIS, which has mostly targeted Egypt’s security forces since the army overthrew Egypt’s Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, warned on Sunday it would set its sights on the country’s Christian minority. \nOn December 11, the jihadists claimed a suicide bombing during a service in a Coptic church in Cairo killing 29 people. \nMasked assailants on a motorbike on February 12 gunned down a Coptic vet at the wheel of his car also in El-Arish, where gunmen killed a 35-year Christian civil servant at the end of January.
