Three draws in their opening four games has seen the Euro 2016 semi-finalists fall four points behind Group D pacesetters Ireland. \nWales’ predicament has been compared to that of Premier League champions Leicester, who are staring relegation full in the face just nine months on from the crowning moment of their own underdog fairy tale. Bale scored on his last appearance for Wales in November’s 1-1 draw against Serbia (Picture: Getty) Wales are unbeaten in their World Cup qualifying campaign but are four points adrift of Group D pacesetters Republic of Ireland (Picture: Getty Images) \nBale admitted that, as in the case of Leicester, maintaining momentum has represented a significant challenge for a squad whose exploits are about to hit the silver screen in the form of Jonny Owen’s latest documentary ‘Don’t Take Me Home’, which can be seen in cinemas from March, 3. \n‘It’s very difficult from coming off such a high,’ he told Metro.co.uk when asked if Wales faced a similar challenge to Leicester, who take a break from their domestic struggles tonight and face Sevilla in the Champions League. \n‘We haven’t performed badly in any of the games. The Serbia one comes to mind. We dominated most of the game and had a lot of chances and they scored in the last minute to equalise. \n‘I still think we’re performing very well. We are still trying to reach those standards we set for ourselves and we’ll continue to keep working hard together to be united as a team and country and try to qualify for the World Cup. Bale’s goal opened the scoring in Wales’ 2-1 defeat to England, which Bale said spurred his team on to make history (Picture: Getty). Bale also scored in the 3-0 win over Russia which he rated as Wales’ best performance of the tournament (Picture: Getty) \n‘We always said as a team speaking about qualifying we don’t just want to qualify for one tournament we want to qualify for every tournament that we possibly can. \n‘The next one is a World Cup and everyone wants to test themselves there and to be involved in it. We’re no different, our mindset is focused on qualifying and we’ll continue to fight until the end.’ \nSpirit, unity and pride were pivotal in helping Wales overcome the odds in the summer, but Bale feels that sense of togetherness was solidified by defeat to England which he picked out as his surprising highlight of the tournament. \n‘I think it (defeat to England) was probably the best moment to be honest. You don’t like losing but it gave us the hunger not to feel like that again in the tournament,’ Bale added. \n‘We wanted to keep battling on and after the England game I think we played our best football. Bale crowned his comeback from injury with a goal in Real Madrid’s 2-0 win over Espanyol last weekend. (Picture: Getty Images) Bale and his Wales teammates are the subject of a new film ‘Don’t Take Me Home’ which can be seen in cinemas from March 3 (Picture: Metro) \n‘Russia was probably our best performance in the whole tournament. Against Northern Ireland we showed the passion and how hard it was to break them down. I’d say that England loss was the one thing that kicked us on and inspired us.’ \nBale’s own performances in the tournament solidified his status as one of the world’s greatest players and has become well accustomed to all that that entails both on and off the pitch. \nSuch is the fame and adulation he now attracts, there is very little that can shock Bale, although he conceded it was strange to see his face adorn a movie billboard. \n‘It’s a bit surreal. It just shows how well we’ve done as a nation. I think the film shows both sides of the story and how we all connect as one.
