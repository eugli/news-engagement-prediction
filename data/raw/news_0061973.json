In fact, she suggests applying it before a foundation with SPF. “My mother was so strict on wearing sunblock,” she says. “She always said, ‘the skin you take care of in your 20s is the skin you have in your 40s’.” Skin-care aside, we were also curious to know if Longoria had any hair hacks, favorite hair products (it's L’Oreal Paris Hair Expert Color Vibrancy Intensive Ultra Recovery Mask BTW) and any insight on a cool air drying technique. She did, and of course she didn’t disappoint. “Thanks to my mom who I inherited gray hair from, I have to color grays every two weeks,” she shared with Allure . “So I’ve been using L’Oreal’s root cover up because it conceals them in three seconds. I like to put a comb in the middle so you don’t lose your natural part, but it’s so easy. You shake, spray and go.” Her number one tip on air dying her hair? “While your hair is wet, twist the front and pin it back for an hour,” she says. “when you let it go it gives you a beautiful wave.” The L’Oreal Paris Hair Expert Color Vibrancy Intensive Ultra Recovery Mask will cost you $6.99 and the Root Cover Up is $10.99. Both can be found in drugstores or at lorealparisusa.com .
