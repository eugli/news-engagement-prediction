Article continues below \nOn Tuesday's live episode of the Rich Eisen Show , broadcast from Houston ahead of Super Bowl LI, Irvin recounted the hilarious story, which can be seen in the video below: \nThe Cowboys went on to win the game 52-17 in one of the biggest blowouts in Super Bowl history, so Irvin's decision to skip out on the speech clearly didn't hurt the team. Article continues below Adam Lallana reveals exactly what he eats in 24 hours - and it's ridiculous \nIrvin also finished with six catches for 114 yards and two touchdowns, so missing Johnson's intermission talk apparently didn't have much impact on the star receiver's production, either. \nMany still consider the Michael Jackson halftime show the best in Super Bowl history, so Irvin and his teammates clearly don't regret their decision. \nIrvin noted that he wasn't upset at Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Antonio Brown's Facebook Live snafu in the locker room after a win in this year's playoffs, since he didn't exactly take the whole \"sanctity of the locker room\" thing seriously back in his day. \nOne thing is for sure, though - Irvin and his teammates would have been ripped by fans and the media for weeks had Twitter been around back in 1993. Fortunately for them, Twitter didn't come around for another 13 years following Dallas's beatdown of the Bills in Super Bowl XXVII. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
