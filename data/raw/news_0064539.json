Had he been on American soil, there’s no question constitutional principles could be invoked in seeking justice for his death. Should those principles not apply because he was standing on the other side of the border? That was the question the Supreme Court considered on Tuesday , during oral arguments in a lawsuit brought by Sergio’s parents, who believe they should have a right to get justice for his killing. The court’s decision in this case could have implications for President Trump’s travel ban, which targets noncitizens who are outside the country.

Credit Associated Press On the day he was killed, Sergio, a Mexican citizen, was playing with friends in the culvert separating El Paso, Tex., and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. The agent who shot him, Jesus Mesa Jr., claimed it was self-defense, but cellphone videos of the shooting refuted that account, showing that Sergio was 60 feet away, and unarmed, when Mr. Mesa shot him in the head. American prosecutors declined to charge Mr. Mesa because his bullet hit Sergio in Mexico. Mexican prosecutors charged Mr. Mesa with murder, but the Obama administration refused to extradite him. Sergio’s family filed a civil suit against Mr. Mesa for violating Sergio’s rights under the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits the unreasonable use of lethal force, and the Fifth Amendment, which bars the taking of life without due process. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In 2015, a federal appeals court in Texas threw out those claims because, it said, Sergio was not an American citizen, and didn’t have enough “voluntary connections” with the United States to be covered by the Constitution. But core constitutional rights aren’t so easily cordoned off — the Supreme Court said so in 2008 when it ruled that noncitizen prisoners held in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, had the right to challenge the legality of their detention.
