He always talks rubbish to me. I don’t have a clue about what’s on his mind. Please help me. What can I do about his doubts? — Kasturi B \nWhat sort of doubts does he have? I’m not sure what you can do, apart from speaking to him as often as possible to try and figure out why he thinks the way he does. Is there something you do that makes him suspicious? Is he naturally suspicious? Do you try and get him to open up about why he feels about some things the way he does? These are issues that can only be solved with open channels of communication. You will never know what he is thinking until you can get him to open up to you, which can only happen when you open up to him and encourage him to reciprocate. As for him speaking rubbish to you, again, I don’t have a clue about what you mean. What I do know is that relationships are about mutual respect. If you are respectful towards him, you deserve that same treatment in return. If he doesn’t respect you, I’m not sure if he’s as in love with you as you claim to be with him. If you don’t like things he says about you, tell him about it. Don’t assume that he knows how you feel until you tell him.\nThere are some things my girlfriend does that annoy me a lot, but I don’t say anything because I don’t want her to start hating me. Am I doing the right thing?\nIf you keep doing this, without letting her know how you feel, you will begin to resent her. When that happens, you will start to hate her instead. How do you think that will make her feel, when it happens? Do you think that’s the right thing? If something bothers you, speak up. It’s not rocket science.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:44:24.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
