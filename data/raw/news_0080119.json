It will probably continue.” \nTrump has a long history of subscribing to unfounded conspiracy theories about Obama. In 2011 he became notorious for promoting the racist conspiracy theory that the 44th president hadn’t actually been born in the United States, a charge that was entirely without merit. \nOne of the Fox News hosts interviewing Trump said that Obama’s political group (possibly Organizing for Action) was helping organize the protests and asked Trump if he blamed the former president personally. Former congressional staffers have been involved with organizing some protests under the “indivisible” banner. \n“I think he is behind it,” Trump said. “I also think it’s politics. That’s the way it is.” \nTrump also blamed Obama for leaks coming from the White House , telling Fox: “I think that President Obama is behind it because his people are certainly behind it. And some of the leaks possibly come from that group, which are really serious because they are very bad in terms of national security.” \nThis isn’t the first time that Trump has blamed protests against him on non-existent left-wing conspiracies. As recently as last week he insisted that the “so-called angry crowds” protesting pro-Trump congressmen were fabricated. The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists. Sad! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2017 \nTrump also infamously blamed protests at one of his Chicago rallies on Bernie Sanders’ campaign , without proof. During his presidential debates against Hillary Clinton, he cited videos by notorious right-wing propagandist James O’Keefe as proof that Clinton’s campaign was paying people to be violent agitators at Trump’s rallies — even though O’Keefe’s production company had been paid $10,000 by the Trump Foundation less than one month before he began his presidential campaign. \nWatch the full video above.
