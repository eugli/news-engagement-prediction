Ben : Personally, I still think the idea of replacing Medicaid with $100 in cash and a kitten for everyone has merit. The challenge for Republicans is that they focused so much on Obamacare that they ignored the fact that we hadn’t had a real marketplace for health care that serves people well for a reasonable price for a long time. Long before Obamacare, we had a health care system distorted by artificial barriers and monopoly power. Democrats need to find a way to exploit that. Gail : Ben, health care is not a commodity that you can improve through the magic of the marketplace. Like I said: Medicare for all. Ben : As my former colleague Avik Roy likes to put it , “Liberals believe that health care is treated as a market commodity today but should not be, and conservatives think that health care is not treated as a market commodity but should be.” Both sides are wrong! But that’s a longer discussion. Gail : And possibly several bottles of wine. Ben : I will bring the bourbon! The bigger problem for the resistance is what Rahm Emanuel laid out last week in California, where he basically gave Alec Baldwin ’s “Glengarry Glen Ross” speech: “ Always be closing .” \n  Gail : Ah, Alec Baldwin. Used to be on stage, now he’s Trump to the world. It’s getting weird but when I hear the president, I subconsciously revert to “Saturday Night Live.” Baldwin is one Trump resister who’s really done his job. But go on. Ben : If only he were still playing Jack Donaghy on “30 Rock,” so we could get that perspective on Trump. Donaghy did admire Willy Wonka for having slave labor and an indoor boat, so perhaps that’s an indication. Back when he was head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Emanuel recruited a bunch of moderate, even conservative Democrats in 2006 to win back the House majority. Is there any willingness to do that right now in the party base? I don’t see it yet. Gail : No, the base is not in any mood to listen to Rahm Emanuel right now, thank God. The real message of the post-Trump Democratic Party will probably be hammered out by the next generation of presidential candidates. But there are spectacular numbers of people out there organizing right now, and I hope they’ll be looking for smart, progressive candidates to run for the state legislatures. That’s where the Republicans really won the game. When the next census is done and it’s time to redraw congressional districts again, the Democrats should be ready to go to war against the gerrymandering. Ben : I agree with you about the need for localism. The other day, Slate’s Jamelle Bouie was tweeting actively about a problem facing Democrats in Virginia on exactly this front: a failure to recruit candidates for many state legislature races, including districts where Hillary Clinton won. Local politics should absolutely be the focus of the Democratic Party and the resistance folks. Instead, it’s been abandoned in favor of shouting at other people about national politics on social media or at town halls. That can be fun and entertaining and make for some sick burns, but as the Tea Party learned, it doesn’t change things. Gail : I spent a decade covering the Connecticut General Assembly and I don’t remember a single party at which anybody said, “Wow, you spend your time in the state legislature! That must be fun.” It’s not, admittedly, a glamorous place. But you ignore it at your peril. Let me draw you back to Washington for a minute. Trump has gone to war with the courts over immigration. What’s your take? \n  Ben : One of the biggest uncertainties about Trump’s presidency is how he will respond to the courts telling him no on something significant. We know how strong presidents like Franklin Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson threatened to pack the courts or ignored them entirely. This will be a much bigger than just this one executive order — it could be a sign that the next four years could be a constant furious battle between the executive and the judiciary. And if there’s anything we know about this president, he doesn’t like to be told something can’t be done, or that he can’t do it. Gail : Well, that sounds pleasant. You know, last week we ended up by agreeing that things were weird in Washington. And here we are again, joining hands and crying, “Yipes!” It’s been great talking with you these last two weeks Ben. Hope we can converse again in the future. If the country’s still standing. Ben : Thank you, Gail. Until we speak again, I have in mind an old C. S. Lewis line that seems apt for today’s social media. In a letter to a friend, he wrote: “It is one of the evils of rapid diffusion of news that the sorrows of all the world come to us every morning” because it can “become an escape from the works of charity we really can do to those we know.” Let’s all keep trying to talk with our neighbors (whether or not we disagree), focus on our neighborhoods, and do what we can do where we live. \nGail Collins is an Op-Ed columnist; Benjamin Domenech is the publisher of The Federalist. \nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up   newsletter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:49:20.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
