But the multilateral sanctions are done.” \nRyan said he doesn’t think the government is “going to go back and reconstitute the multilateral sanctions that were in place.” \n“I think we should expend our effort where it can pay off the most,” Ryan said. “And that’s why I think what they’re doing now does make a lot of sense. So I think the key is to rigorously enforce this deal.” \nRyan also suggested increasing sanctions, a step the Trump administration took on Friday. \nThe US Treasury issued a new wave of sanctions against Iran , targeting 13 people and 12 entities days after the White House put Iran “on notice” over its recent ballistic missile test and alleged involvement in an attack on a Saudi ship near Yemen. \nThe Treasury said the sanctions are “fully consistent with the United States’ commitments” under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the Iran nuclear deal. \n“I think what this administration is doing, which I agree with, is saying, ‘We have a new administration, and we’re going to hold you, Iran, to account.'” Ryan told NBC. “This last administration did not do that. This new administration needs to do that. And I think that’s what you’re getting here.” \nGen. James Mattis, Trump’s secretary of defence, is also at odds with Trump over the nuclear deal. He said during his confirmation hearing that he supports leaving the deal in place. \n“It is an imperfect arms control agreement — it’s not a friendship treaty,” Mattis said. “But when America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies.” \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
