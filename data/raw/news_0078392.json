One of the goals they set last year was to create a healthy, safe school,\" principal Sue Jury said. \nREAD MORE: \nThis year's council would continue on the work and make an orchard a reality. \nHowever, orchards were expensive so the school also reached out to KidsCan for funding. \nOn the KidsCan website she found an \"Orchards in Schools\" programme, encouraging children to plant and grow fruit trees. \nKidsCan has planted 28 orchards in schools since the programme began, with more than 840 fruit trees growing on school grounds. \nJury wanted St Claudine Thevenet School to be a part of that so she signed the school up for funding and the school is now on the waiting list. Ad Feedback \nAlthough she expected it would take some time to get funding, Jury was already looking forward to having fresh fruit and planned on planting basic trees such as apple and pear varieties. \nThe vegetable garden was planted last year and the students had been growing fresh vegetables for the school and their families ever since. \n\"We have a sharing table - vegetables are put out for students and families to use. For example, we've used pumpkins to make pumpkin soup,\" Jury said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:48:46.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
