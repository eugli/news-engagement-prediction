Photo: Australian War Memorial \n\"By the end of January last year six of us were going. That's all it was going to be - a small family paying a personal tribute to a long lost aunt.\" \nBut then Mr Noyce emailed the Australian War Memorial pointing out this could be the last opportunity for many of the first generation of relatives of the murdered nurses to pay their respects. The email was referred to the Australian Embassy in Jakarta and the next thing he knew an official ceremony and service was being organised on Bangka Island. \nAbout 80 people will attend, including friends and relatives of the nurses and civilian internees and existing members of the Australian Army Nursing Corps. \"It's been phenomenal.\" \nMr Noyce had some unusual excess baggage this trip: a 20 kilogram bronze plaque dedicated to those killed on Radji beach. \"This beach is hallowed ground,\" it says. \nThe 75th anniversary event on February 16 is important for a number of reasons. \"First of all to invigorate the memory of the nurses and build their story so it is more widely known,\" he says. \nThe relatives also want to do something that will help their memory endure on the island - a nurse education centre possibly, that would incorporate their names. \n\"There is a developing closeness between the people of Muntok and Australia and elsewhere connected with what happened 75 years ago.\" \nOnly one nurse, Sister Vivian Bullwinkel, survived the Bangka Island Massacre. She was shot in the hip but feigned dead in the surf until the Japanese executioners walked away. \nWhen Sister Bullwinkel returned to Australia she contacted all the families of the nurses who died. She conveyed some of their remarkable final words before they were slaughtered. Mr Noyce will read these on Radji beach on Thursday. \n\"Girls, take it, don't squeal,\" said Sister Esther Sarah Jean Stewart. \"Sends shivers down you, doesn't it?\" says Mr Noyce. \"The nurses knew their fate. Don't squeal, by God.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:02:04.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
