But rice is known to contain up to ten times more arsenic than other foods due to the way it was grown. Generally, brown rice has higher levels because the arsenic is found in the outer coating or bran, which is removed in the milling process to produce white rice. Rice is known to contain up to ten times more arsenic - which can cause cancer in frequent exposure - than other foods due to the way it was grown Industrial contaminants and pesticides used to grow the food in the past can remain in the polluted paddy fields for decades - meaning the rice in supermarket shelves often contains higher levels. THINK TWICE ABOUT HOW YOU COOK RICE You may not think there's anything wrong with how you cook rice - but there probably is. If you're not using enough water then you're at risk of heart disease and cancer, a scientist warned last week. Cooking the grains in excess water helps to flush out arsenic, preventing any possible chemical poisoning. While soaking rice overnight slashes levels of the industrial toxin by around 80 per cent, a contamination expert claimed. Researchers from the University of Illinois at Chicago assessed the urine of 73 participants from a previous nutrition survey they conducted. They ranged from between six and 80 years old and had all reported eating gluten-free food over a period of five years. However, those who consumed the most had higher concentrations of arsenic in their urine, they found. Their levels of the toxic metals was almost twice as high, according to the study published in the journal Epidemiology. While traces of mercury was almost 70 per cent greater in those restricted to a gluten-free diet. Study author Dr Maria Argos said: 'These results indicate that there could be unintended consequences of eating a gluten-free diet.' However, she added that further research is needed to determine the health effects of consuming both metals.
