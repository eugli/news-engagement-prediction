Aarey is threatened by the proposed Metro III project, for which the government has proposed to build a car shed after cutting down hundreds of trees. Calling this a \"crime\", actor-director Farhan tweeted: \"Urban development should include creating more green spaces, not getting rid of existing ones.\"\nGreen activists have also appealed to citizens to vote to save the forest, irrespective of the ward they live in, as Aarey is a precious green lung that generates clean air for all of Mumbai and is also an important recreational space where Mumbaikars can experience rich biodiversity. These messages have been circulating on Facebook and WhatsApp, and the topic #VoteToSaveAarey was trending on Twitter yesterday. In the messages, activists are taking potshots at the BJP government.\n\"All major political parties from Mumbai understand the importance of saving the Aarey forest except for BJP. It is the only party that has not committed to save Aarey,\" said a member from the #VoteToSaveAarey campaign. MNS chief Raj Thackeray, Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray have supported the cause from the beginning, and now the NCP and Congress too have expressed support.\nTweet talk \nRiteish Deshmukh @Ritieshd: No trees = No Oxygen = No Life. Basic lesson I learnt in school. Why do we forget this when we grow up\nJaaved Jaaferi @jaavedjaaferi: AAREY can soon become JAA REY.. Mumbaikars need to come together to save our lungs for the future generations. Hardly any green spaces left\nDia Mirza @deespeak: With density of population, pollution levels, is it not imperative to protect our green spaces, if not add more?\nVishal Dadlani @VishalDadlani Mumbai, for your own sake, vote in big numbers tomorrow. And don’t vote for anyone who hasn’t committed to #SaveAarey!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:49:30.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
