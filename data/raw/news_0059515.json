Fallon’s Trump began reporting on “Friday’s incident” in Sweden “that absolutely did happen,” before turning to his pick for national security adviser and “a new study” that finds “golf totally counts as work”— accompanied by a photo of the real Trump with a putter in hand. \nFor the record, that “incident” in Sweden Fallon joked about absolutely did not happen. During POTUS’ post-inauguration rally in Florida, he referenced “what’s happening last night in Sweden” and “we’ve got to keep our country safe. Trump later clarified his statements on Twitter. My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017 \nFallon also introduced a “Bad Things Button” generator to report on the actual bad things and not the bad things mainstream media has been discussing. “There’s been a Godzilla attack in Finland,” he declared. “Finland, can you believe it? And Godzilla of all people.” \nWriter and comedian Jo Firestone reprised her Betsy DeVos impersonation to report the weather as a “weatherman” for TNN. “I like the sun. Whenever it comes out, I say, ‘Hello, sun!’ and look right at it and sometimes my eyes burn,” she said. \nDuring the election, rumors floated around that the real Trump had thought about starting his own Trump-run media conglomerate, a la Fox News. Trump later quashed those rumors by telling Cincinnati radio station 700WLW that he had “no interest in Trump TV.” \nWatch Fallon’s TNN in the clip above.
