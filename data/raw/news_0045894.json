REUTERS TV/File Photo A US-based designer said he hoped to cash in on the assassination of the North Korean leader's half-brother by selling T-shirts emblazoned with \"LOL\" in the style worn by his alleged assassin. \nThe designer said \"human rights abuses\" by North Korea's leaders outweighed any arguments against making such T-shirts. \nPolice believe a woman captured on video wearing a shirt with the letters \"LOL\" poisoned Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Malaysian police have made a series of arrests. \n\"I thought she looked very stylish. Iâ€™m also always looking out for newsworthy designs - things that are easily made into memes,\" the designer, who gave his name as Joel and said he lived in the United States, told Reuters in an online message. He declined to give his full name. \nA chief executive of online marketplace Redbubble, where several T-Shirts with the LOL (laugh out loud) label are being offered, did not immediately comment. A representative at the company's San Francisco office declined to comment. \nRedbubble produces and sells merchandise made by independent designers who get part of the proceeds, often about 16 percent. Joel's LOL shirt was offered at about $35 on Saturday. \nThe designer said sales were slow so far but that he saw the shirt appealing to feminists, internet \"trolls\" and anyone who opposed North Korea and other \"fascist\" regimes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T08:47:21.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
