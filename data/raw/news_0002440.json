Lin-Manuel Miranda ’s hip-hop Broadway hit about founding father Alexander Hamilton won’t arrive until sometime in the 2018-19 theatrical season. No one’s coughing up the exact date, but we’re looking at a wait time of 20 months — minimum. ... (Matthew J. Palm) \n• “The King & I,” Sept. 12-17: A young British governess goes head to head with the king of Siam in this 1951 Tony-winning Rodgers & Hammerstein classic that was revived on Broadway in 2015. \n• “On Your Feet!,” Oct. 17-22: This 2015 musical uses the songs of Gloria Estefan — “Conga,” “Rhythm Is Going to Get You” and more — to tell the pop singer’s story. \n• “Love Never Dies: The Phantom Returns,” Nov. 26-Dec. 1: Andrew Lloyd Webber’s sequel to his record-setting “Phantom of the Opera” finds the masked one up to new tricks. After disappointing response to the original 2010 London run, the show was reworked and a planned Broadway production never happened. \n• “School of Rock,” Dec. 26-31: Also from Andrew Lloyd Webber, this musical comedy is based on the 2003 movie in which Jack Black plays an unconventional music teacher. The stage adaptation, written by “Downton Abbey” creator Julian Fellowes, opened on Broadway in 2015. \n• “Waitress,” March 20-25, 2018: Pop singer Sara Bareilles wrote the music for “Waitress,” based on the 2007 film about an unhappily married woman whose future rests on winning a pie contest. It made its Broadway debut in 2016. \n• “Something Rotten!,” April 24-29, 2018: This 2015 Broadway show takes a comic look at the creation of the world’s first musical — back in the Renaissance, where William Shakespeare reigns supreme. \n• “Rent,” June 5-10, 2018: The Tony-winning rock musical is celebrating its 20 th anniversary with this tour. The show follows a diverse group of young friends coping with poverty, AIDS, relationships and more. \nIn addition to the series, two theater favorites will make return engagements. \n• “The Book of Mormon,” Dec. 12-17: Two missionaries learn a lot about religion and life in this Tony-winning comedy from the creators of TV’s “South Park.” \n• “The Lion King,” Feb. 14-March 11, 2018: Another Tony winner, “The Lion King” roared onto the stage in 1997 and is now the third-longest-running production in Broadway history. The show uses inventive puppetry to bring Disney’s animated cartoon to life. \nThe season is presented by the arts center, Florida Theatrical Association and Broadway Across America.
