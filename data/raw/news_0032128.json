We all got to see another side to you that you don’t always let us see, and we appreciate that. All us artists here f**king adore you,” she said, marking her second f-bomb of the night (after using a previous speech to apologise for her first).\n“You are our light. The way you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel, is empowering. You make them stand up for themselves, and I love you. I always have, and I always will,” she told Beyonce, who herself was fighting back tears.\nAdele even snapped the coveted award in two, apparently so she could give half to Bey:\nmedia_camera Snapped in two: They just don’t make Grammys like they used to.

I adore you, you move my soul every single day and you have done for nearly 17 years. I want you to be my mummy, alright?”\nAdele was more blunt backstage after her Album of the Year win, telling reporters of Beyonce: “I thought it was her year. What the f**k does she have to do to win album of the year? ... The other artists who mean that much to me are all dead.” See her candid backstage comments below (language warning):\nShe really doesn't want this award Lol pic.twitter.com/49CNbPqDKj\n— horace (@sounderemployed) February 13, 2017 It was a triumphant end to the night for Adele, who suffered an embarrassing setback earlier in the evening when her surprise George Michael tribute went off the rails. The star looked despondent after she stopped the performance one minute in , unhappy with her performance.\n“I know it’s live TV, I’m sorry,” she interrupted before a series of expletives that were bleeped for viewers watching at home.\nAdele praises Beyonce during her Record of the Year acceptance speech: \"I adore you. you move my soul every single day.\" #GRAMMYs pic.twitter.com/vmS0PXxsml\n— Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 13, 2017 “I need to start again.
