Moree, in northern NSW, had a record breaking 54 consecutive days with the mercury above 35C.\nYet parts of Western Australia have seen near record breaking rainfall.\nmedia_camera Highest maximum temperatures observed from 1 January to 14 February 2017. Tasmania reached the high 20Cs and was significantly cooler than the mainland.: Bureau of Meteorology\nWARMEST JANUARY EVER\nIn a Special Climate Statement, released on Wednesday, the BoM said three distinct heatwaves had rolled through the eastern states during January and February.\nBut even between the heatwaves temperatures were still well above average.\n“As a whole, January 2017 was the warmest month on record for Sydney and Brisbane, ” the report stated.\nSouth Australia also recorded its highest ever February temperatures. In contrast, WA has seen an “extraordinarily wet start to the year,” the BoM said.\nRavensthorpe, in the state’s south, recorded 240.8mm for February, its wettest such month in 116 years as moisture from the Australian monsoon stretched through WA.\nWhile, overall, Summer 2017 wasn’t quite the hottest ever — January 1939 pipped it at the post — the sheer length of time people have had to put up with the heat was remarkable.\n“It was the consistency of high temperatures more than the extreme temperatures themselves that made early 2017 an exceptional event,” the report stated.\nFebruary has seen 11 days where at least one-third of NSW had maximum temperatures eight degrees or more above average.\n“Not since the summer of 1938—39 has such a large area of NSW — more than one third of the state — recorded 50 or more days of 35C or above during summer,” said the BoM.\nOn 11 February, almost the whole of New South Wales — more than 93% — was ten degrees warmer than average.\nmedia_camera Maximum temperatures in Autumn are likely to be above average. Picture: Bureau of Meteorology.\nABOVE AVERAGE HEAT FOR AUTUMN\nIf you can’t stand the heat you might want to get out of the NSW and Southern Queensland kitchen as it’s all set to continue.\nBoM Senior Climatologist, Robyn Duell, said temperatures were likely to stay stubbornly above average well into Autumn while fewer rain-bearing systems will cross the coast.\n“In terms of temperatures days and nights are likely to be cooler than average in parts of the far north but warmer than average over the rest of Australia [and] further heatwaves are possible,” she said on Thursday.\n“The rainfall outlook for March to May indicates below average rainfall for much of Australia [which means the] rains could be late,”\nThe only areas where it’s possible — but by no means guaranteed — that average levels of rain could fall are Western Australia, the Top End and coastal Queensland,\nOne of the culprits behind the heat is the almost complete falling away of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) weather system.\nmedia_camera Rainfall is likely to be below average in the south east. Picture: Bureau of Meteorology.\nWith El Niño petering away last year, a La Nina could have been expected to take its place bringing wetter conditions to the east coast. But it hasn’t eventuated.\n“[El Niño and La Nina are] the two biggest drivers of our climate and they’ve been nothing to write home about, so when they are not doing anything you go to the second tier of climate divers,” Dr Andrew Watkins, Senior Climate Predictor at the BoM told news.com.au last week.\nmedia_camera The Southern Annular Mode is having a dramatic effect on Australia’s weather bringing hot winds and low rainfall.\nThis has allowed secondary weather systems, such as the Southern Annular Mode, or SAM, to exert themselves.\nThe SAM is characterised by westerly winds that originate in the Antarctic.\n“Since November, SAM has been a negative phase which means the weather system is further north than usual, bringing westerly winds to areas usually spared.\n“What happens through summer is a big high pressure system sits over the centre of Australia and starts to cook and these westerly winds come along and blast it over NSW, Queensland and northern parts of Victoria and South Australia.”\nWith SAM in full swing, and no La Nina to push it back, this coming Autumn is shaping up to be a continuation of our long hot summer.\nbenedict.brook@news.com.au\nWhat's Wrong With Our Weather? 50:43 Across the world weather seems to be becoming more extreme.
