The stories are wrong in many cases, but it's the overall intent. Look at that paper over the last two years. In fact, they had to write a letter of essentially [sic] apology to their subscribers because they got the election so wrong,\" the president said in an Oval Office interview with Breitbart News, a sympathetic conservative news site. \"They did a front page article on women talking about me, and the women went absolutely wild because they said that was not what they said. It was a big front-page article, and the Times wouldn't even apologize and yet they were wrong. You probably saw the women. They went on television shows and everything.\"\n\"For instance, when people read the story on the women â€” first of all, the reporter who wrote the story has a website full of hatred of Donald Trump . So, he shouldn't be allowed to be a reporter because he's not objective. It's not all, but it has many negative things about Donald Trump,\" Trump added. \"But that's one of many. So, when you read the Sunday New York Times, it's just hit after hit after hit. And honestly, I think people are wise to it because if you look at the approval rating, you see it's down. You know, it's gone. There's very little approval.\"\nTrump told Breitbart another issue of concern to him is the mainstream media's control of the market after being asked if those outlets' being owned by a few corporations presented a problem.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

You have to have competition in the marketplace and you have to have competition among the media,\" Trump said. \"And I'm not commenting on any one deal, but you need competition generally and you certainly need it with media.\"\nTrump granted the interview to Matthew Boyle, the Washington political editor of Breitbart.
