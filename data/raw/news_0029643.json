What did the President know and when did he know it?\" Mr Coons said, echoing a question made famous by the Watergate scandal, which forced president Richard Nixon to resign in 1974. External Link: @SenSanders: Michael Flynn leaving the administration isn't enough to clear up questions that many of us have about the Trump team's ties with Russia \nTwo leading Republicans in the Senate — Bob Corker and John Cornyn — also said the intelligence committee should investigate Mr Flynn's contacts with Russia and that he may need to testify. \nRepublican senator Roy Blunt, a member of the same committee, told a local radio station that the panel should interview Mr Flynn \"very soon\" as part of its investigation into attempts by Russia to influence the US election. \n\"General Flynn's resignation also raises further questions about the Trump administration's intentions toward Vladimir Putin's Russia,\" said Senator John McCain, a leading Republican voice on foreign relations. \nBut the highest-ranking Republican in Congress, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, sidestepped questions about whether legislators should look into Mr Flynn's Russia ties, adding he would leave it to the Trump administration to explain the circumstances behind Flynn's departure. \nMr Flynn, an early and enthusiastic supporter of Mr Trump, was a strong advocate of a softer line toward Russian President Vladimir Putin , and his departure from the key post could hinder Mr Trump's efforts to warm up relations with Moscow. Trump worried about continued leaks from Washington Photo: Mr Flynn's conversations with the ambassador reportedly occurred when the Obama administration slapped sanctions on Russia. (Reuters: Carlos Barria) \nThe Washington Post reported last week that the issue of sanctions came up in the conversations with the ambassador, although Mr Flynn told Mr Pence they had not. \nIn his first public comment about the Flynn issue since the resignation, Mr Trump deflected the focus to leaks from his administration. External Link: @realDonaldTrump: The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc? \nIn his resignation letter, Mr Flynn acknowledged he had \"inadvertently briefed the Vice President-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador.\" \nA US official familiar with the transcripts of the calls with Mr Kislyak said Mr Flynn indicated that if Russia did not retaliate in kind for Mr Obama's December 29 order expelling 35 Russian suspected spies and sanctioning of Russian spy agencies, that restraint could smooth the way toward a broader discussion of improving US-Russian relations once Mr Trump took power.

(The World) \nTo the surprise of some observers at the time, Mr Putin did not take retaliatory measures — Mr Trump praised his restraint. \nMr Flynn's discussions with the Russian diplomat could potentially have been in violation of a law known as the Logan Act, banning private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments about disputes or controversies with the United States. \nHowever, nobody has been prosecuted in modern times under the law, which dates from 1799. \nVice Admiral Robert Harward, who served under Defence Secretary James Mattis, is the leading candidate to replace Mr Flynn, two US officials said. \nThe scramble to replace Mr Flynn began on Monday evening and continued with phone calls and meetings into the early hours of Tuesday in an effort to enable Mr Trump to make a decision and put the matter behind him as soon as possible, said an official involved in the effort. \nAlso under consideration was retired General David Petraeus, a former CIA director whose reputation was tainted by a scandal over mishandling classified information with his biographer, with whom he was having an affair.
