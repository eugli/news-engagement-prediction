According to reports, he's plotting a surprising move for Gaston Ramirez. \nThe Middlesbrough midfielder was hellbent on leaving in January during the transfer window but failed to secure his move away. (Ramirez made the permanent switch following a successful loan spell) \nIn spite of handing in a transfer request. Though it appears his days at the Riverside are numbered with Liverpool plotting a summer swoop. \nPremier League champions Leicester City were hoping to tie up a deal but Aitor Karanka didn't succumb to the Foxes or the players pressure. (Ramirez joined the Saints for a reported ÂŁ12 million in 2012) \nKaranka has firm on this stance that the 26-year-old was not for sale as he remains an important player for the club. \nYet, if a big-money offer is tabled in the summer, they may eventually sell up. And per TuttoMercatoWeb , Klopp has already held informal talks. \nThe Uruguayan only joined them on a permanent deal last summer but could potentially be in line to appear for his fourth English side following spells with Southampton, Hull City and Boro.
