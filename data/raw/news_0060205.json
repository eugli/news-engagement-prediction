Mundelein Village Trustee Dawn Abernathy, as pictured during a Nov. 9, 2015 Village Board meeting. (Rick Kambic / Pioneer Press) Rick Kambic trustee referred to a mayoral candidate's campaign funds as \"Korean money.\"\nThe thread, which has since been deleted, appeared in the private Mundelein Village Issues Facebook group. The group has about 1,500 members. \nThe debate began when current village trustee and mayoral candidate Holly Kim responded to comments by Dawn Abernathy, an incumbent trustee seeking reelection. \nKim is running with the A Mundelein United Party, a slate that includes non-incumbent candidates for three trustee spots and a clerk seat. \nA question arose as to whether or not Abernathy was on a slate of her own with Mayor Steve Lentz, Village Trustee Ray Semple, trustee candidate Scott Black and Village Clerk Katy Timmerman. \n\"Again you fail to see I am not part of a slate,\" Abernathy commented. \"We have to work together to counter the $14,000 in Korean money you have funding your race. We are pooling our money together. That is called being fiscally responsible.\" \nThe reference to \"Korean money\" set off a string of comments criticizing Abernathy's wording and questioning her intent. \nLater in the thread, Abernathy apologized for the comment and wrote that Kim placed an advertisement in a Korean newspaper outside of Mundelein and received a large sum of money because of it. She said that her comment was meant to highlight that ad. \nAbernathy said by phone that she should have more clearly described her thought process. She insisted that she doesn't think less of Korean people. \n\"As an avid volunteer, mother and public servant; anyone that knows me or has worked with me, can attest to my lifelong dedication to improving the lives of all people in our community,\" Abernathy said in a statement Thursday morning. \nIllinois State Board of Elections records show that as of the last quarterly filing of Kim's campaign on Dec. 31, Residents for A Mundelein United had an available balance of $12,590. Donations ranged from $200 to $2,000 and were from individuals and businesses in numerous north suburban communities, records show. \nAt the end of the same period, Abernathy's committee had $5,597 in cash on hand, records show . Semple's campaign committee was formed just last month while Lentz had a balance of about $14, records show. \nKim said Wednesday that Abernathy's comment was troublesome. \n\"To be honest, it stings. I was born here, lived here all my life, serve in my community, and it's comments like this that remind me that some will always view me as different,\" Kim, who is Korean, said in an email. \"What message are we sending our young people when public officials make divisive comments like this and judge someone by their ethnicity instead of their character?\" \nKim said her father is an officer in a few Korean business associations and that he relayed her accomplishments and aspirations to some of his colleagues. \n\"These business owners, and positive members of society, were like an extended family to me, and they want to see 'their daughter' succeed,\" Kim said in an email. \nWhen reached by phone, Abernathy said she wrote her comment too quickly and was merely referencing a factual event. She said she doesn't have a problem with campaign contributions coming from outside of Mundelein. \n\"That's how she raised a lot of her money,\" Abernathy said. \"It is what it is. I'm not alarmed by it and I meant no disrespect.\" \nSemple said he is not on a slate with Abernathy because several of the incumbents have differing opinions on a few topics. However, he said they agreed to limited joint efforts in light of Kim's fundraising power. \n\"When I saw that she had $12,000 by September, I took a big gulp because that's a lot of money for a local election,\" Semple said. \"I was alarmed by the sum. I didn't distinguish where it came from, though.\" \nWhen shown Abernathy's Facebook comment, Brandon Lee, a communications coordinator for advocacy group Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said he couldn't think of a reasonable context for identifying Koreans as the source of Kim's fundraising. \n\"We have a candidate who's running for mayor and raised a lot of money, and there's another person drawing a conclusion that it's Korean money,\" Lee said. \"Would that same accusation or labeling come up if it was a Caucasian candidate who received large sums of money from Koreans? No, I don't think that connection would be made or voiced publicly.\" \nLee said several immigrant populations struggle with a perception known as \"perpetual foreigner,\" which classifies people as different even after several generations as U.S. citizens. \n\"A report we put out in 2012 says 50,622 Asian Americans live in Lake County, which is a 77 percent growth from 2000 to 2010,\" Lee said. \"Every person has a right to participate in the democratic process, and I think this comment is pretty dismissive of the Korean people in the region.\" \nMayor Steve Lentz said he's not affiliated politically with Abernathy other than sharing a few campaigning expenses. \n\"Dawn Abernathy posted on Facebook a poorly expressed idea that she immediately apologized for,\" Lentz said in a Thursday morning email. \"It was heartfelt, sincere and should put the issue to bed so we can continue with our campaign to keep Mundelein moving forward.\" \nTwitter @Rick_Kambic", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:04:07.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
