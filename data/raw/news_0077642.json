However, certain comments from friends or family members can be highly triggering to those that are suffering. \nWhen a loved one is battling with an eating disorder, it can be hard to know what to say. As a therapist in private practice in Rockville, Maryland, specializing in helping those struggling with eating disorders, I’ve seen the negative impact that these statements can have on people in recovery. \nIn honor of National Eating Disorders Awareness week, the following are five statements that you shouldn’t say to someone with an eating disorder. \n1. You look so healthy. \nSaying “you look so healthy” is often a well-intentioned effort to tell the person that you are supportive of their recovery. However, often their eating disorder voice will twist any appearance-related comments into a negative sentiment about their body. \nIt is generally a good rule of thumb to avoid making any comments about the person’s weight, body, or appearance. Someone with an eating disorder is usually entrenched in negative thoughts about their weight and body. \nTherefore, it can be helpful to pay them a compliment that has nothing to do with their outward appearance. A more helpful statement might be, “You look much happier,” or “You seem to be more at peace with yourself.” \n2. You look way too thin. \nOn the flip side, telling a person with an eating disorder that they look “too thin” can also be triggering. At their core, eating disorders are not really about a person’s weight. Often a person who is suffering is engaging in eating disorder behaviors, in an effort to feel more in control of their lives, cope with past trauma, or to numb difficult emotions. Further, it is a common misconception that you have to be emaciated in order to have an eating disorder. A person can be struggling with an eating disorder at any weight . \nTelling someone that they look too thin may be exactly what their eating disorder voice wants to hear. It’s important to understand that often there is no weight that their eating disorder voice will deem to be “too thin.” \nA more helpful statement could be one where you point out your concern over the person’s behaviors and how it is impacting their life, rather than focusing on their weight. An eating disorder is a mental illness, and therefore it is impossible to determine someone’s level of suffering based upon their physical appearance. \n3. You don’t look like you have an eating disorder. \nTelling the person that they “don’t look like they have an eating disorder” only serves to fuel their disordered thinking. Their eating disorder voice will tell them that they are “not sick enough” to seek help. Denial is an integral component to eating disorders and this statement insinuates that the person does not “look sick enough” to have an eating disorder. \nAn eating disorder is a mental illness , and therefore it is impossible to determine someone’s level of suffering based upon their physical appearance. \nEveryone who is struggling with an eating disorder deserves to seek treatment, regardless of his or her weight. Eating disorders come in one size: miserable. \n4. I need to lose some weight. \nEngaging with your loved one in a discussion about your latest diet program is counterproductive and can also be highly triggering. Discussing how you are on a low-carb diet with someone who has an eating disorder is akin to talking about your drinking binge with a person who is recovering from alcoholism. \nInstead, try to engage in discussions with the person about things that are unrelated to food, weight, and exercise. The person likely already spends a huge amount of time thinking about these topics and could probably use a mental break. \n5. Why can’t you just eat that? \nAsking someone to “just eat” insinuates that they are choosing to have an eating disorder. If treatment for an eating disorder was as simple as telling the person to just “suck it up and eat,” we would have no need for residential centers, therapists, or nutritionists. Telling someone with an eating disorder to “just eat,” is like saying to someone with a broken leg to “just walk.” \nEating disorders are not a choice. No one would choose to watch in terror as their hair falls out, to lose their friends because they cannot go out to eat, to exercise despite physical pain, or to binge eat until they feel like they are going to explode. If you find yourself wanting to make this kind of statement, I would encourage you to educate yourself on eating disorders and the devastating impact that they can have on people’s lives. \nTry to express to the person that you understand they are not choosing to feel and behave this way. However, they can choose to work towards recovery, and you are here to support them every step of the way. \nRather than shaming them, encourage the person to seek professional help from a therapist, psychiatrist, or dietitian — preferably one who specializes in eating disorders and health at every size. \nThe Bottom Line \nIf we can begin to eradicate some of the triggering and unhelpful comments that are made to those with eating disorders, we can fight back against the misconceptions and stigma that surround these life-threatening illnesses. \nWith access to appropriate treatment and support, individuals with eating disorders can go on to lead productive and meaningful lives.
