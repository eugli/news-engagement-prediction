They’re now becoming more aligned, which likely shows how Instagram is diversifying their content and purpose. Which, in itself, is an interesting trend to note. \nAs always, Facebook has also included Hot Topics listings for: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:41:17.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
