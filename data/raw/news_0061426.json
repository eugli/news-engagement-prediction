By Cole Delbyck \nNewsrooms across the country came to a grinding halt on Thursday when photos of Justin Bieber sporting a curious stain surfaced online. Naturally, the image of the world’s biggest pop star strolling around Los Angeles in soaked sweatpants raised some of the most pressing questions of our time. \nIs bladder control like so 2016 ?

(VIDEO) https://t.co/FfJdrWF18H — TMZ (@TMZ) February 23, 2017 \nAlas, all good rumors must be put to rest. The “Purpose” singer later set the record straight with a poetic tweet explaining that the stain on his “dick area” was actually water from some flowers he had in the car. Someone got me flowers and I was driving, made a turn, and the water spilled on my dick area...Didn't bother me if it made ya laugh nice! — Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) February 24, 2017 \nBut the ever so self-aware Bieber has apparently developed a sense of humor about himself and didn’t pass up the opportunity to poke fun at the situation. He followed up the tweet with a side-by-side comparison of himself and Billy Madison, perhaps the most famous pee-in-pants-er (the official term) in the world. \n“You aint cool ... unless you pee your pants,” he wrote alongside the photo. A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Feb 23, 2017 at 12:58pm PST \nFinally, this long national nightmare has been put to rest.
