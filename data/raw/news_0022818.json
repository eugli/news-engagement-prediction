(You can read King’s letter here .) \nWarren was initially warned not to impugn another senator’s motives by Senator Steve Daines , the presiding officer tonight, in violation of Rule 19 of the Senate, which, in part, says this: \nNo Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator. \nWarren expressed some bewilderment that quoting King and Kennedy “is a violation of Senate rules.” \nDaines said that it is, and he just warned her to be aware of this rule. \nWarren continued, but a little over 20 minutes later, as she kept reading, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell interjected and said she has “impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama.” \nHe invoked Rule 19, and Warren immediately responded, “I am surprised that the words of Coretta Scott King are not suitable for debate in the United States Senate. I ask leave of the Senate to continue my remarks.” \nMcConnell immediately objected and Daines told Warren to take her seat. Warren immediately appealed the ruling. \nThe Senate eventually took a vote tonight and voted 49-43 upholding the ruling that she violated Rule 19. \nEarlier in the night, Warren took to Twitter to denounce what occurred, and her Democratic colleagues joined in to get #LetLizSpeak going: Tonight on the Senate floor, I tried to speak about why @SenatorSessions is totally unfit to serve as Attorney General. \n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 On the floor, I read a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing @SenatorSessions 's judicial nomination: https://t.co/mnACXekh8f \n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 I spoke out about @SenatorSessions – until @SenateMajLdr McConnell decided to silence me. https://t.co/qbty7x0iLl \n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 I will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory & racist comments that have no place in our justice system. \n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 I will not be silent while the Republicans rubber stamp an AG who will never stand up to the @POTUS when he breaks the law. \n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 Tonight @SenateMajLdr silenced Mrs King's voice on the Sen floor –& millions who are afraid & appalled by what's happening in our country. \n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 8, 2017 . @SenateMajLdr won't #LetLizSpeak because he can't deny what Coretta Scott King had to say about Senator Sessions #StopSessions pic.twitter.com/pS1l6CklTJ \n— Senator Mazie Hirono (@maziehirono) February 8, 2017 It’s unacceptable & inappropriate that @SenWarren was stopped from reading a letter by Coretta Scott King on the Senate floor #LetLizSpeak pic.twitter.com/etP0ZCQlAy \n— Sen.
