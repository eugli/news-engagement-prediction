The woman slowed, rolled down her window and was just about to ask if the policeman needed help.\nThat’s when the man jumped at Amie, grabbed his baton, and began beating the officer over the head, said Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie at a Monday press conference.\nWilliams-Tillman slammed on her brakes and called 911. She jumped from her car and onto the back of a 28-year-old male suspect, the chief said.\nShe also was able to get the man’s hand off the cop’s handgun, Dabadie said. She and Amie grappled with the suspect until back-up officers arrived.\n“I can’t think of … very many people on one hand that would have not just rode by, or maybe made a phone call to 911,” Dabadie said. “But Mrs. Tillman went above and beyond.”\nBeckoned to the microphone, Williams-Tillman was overcome. She gestured for Amie, who was standing behind her, to come forward. He wrapped his arm around the woman and held her close.\n“I’m just glad that he’s here,” said a crying Williams-Tillman. “He was in a struggle. He needed help. I said ‘I can’t leave him.’\n“I looked in his eyes, and he looked back at me,” she said.\n“I’ve always been a tough cookie, my husband always told me.”\nRead: Cop Dies from Inhaling Liquid Nitrogen While Rescuing Worker at Sperm Bank \nOfficer Amie was overcome as well. “This a true here right here that saved my life,” he said.\nThe suspect was identified as Thomas Bennett.
