SUPPLIED \nThe sale includes a four-bedroom vicarage and the church hall. \nBayleys Auckland Daryl Spense said the property had a CV of $3.25 million. \nREAD MORE: \nHe did not say what he thought it might sell for. SUPPLIED \nThe former Church of the Ascension in Point Chevalier has a CV of more than $3 million. \nThe church comes with stained glass windows and a bell tower while the four-bedroom one bathroom vicarage is a 155sqm Californian-style bungalow. \nThe adjacent 240sqm Rattray Memorial Hall was built in the 1940s. \nBoth the church and the hall had been used in recent times by Girl Guides and Boy Scouts. SUPPLIED \nThe main church has glass stained windows and a bell tower. \nThe church was a \"blank canvas\" with the potential for redevelopment into character homes, Spense said. \nThe homes were built in the post-war era and had a solid foundation, he said. \n\"It's like the old cliche…. 'they don't build 'em like this anymore',\" Spense said. \n\"Admittedly, there are no toilets or bathroom facilities, and minimal kitchen amenities in the main church. \n\"But the stained-glass windows and native timber walls and flooring just ooze with character.\" \nThe vicarage, although habitable in its current state, would benefit from an interior renovation. \nIt is zoned mixed housing suburban and backs onto the Pt Chevalier Tennis Club courts. \nBayleys Auckland Karen Spires said it was a \"spiritual experience\" walking through all three structures. \n\"You can definitely feel there is a very positive aura and energy emanating from within the walls – walls which have witnessed hundreds of Christenings, marriages, wedding celebrations, and wedding anniversaries.\" \nThe site is two titles, being sold together by the Anglican Church. \nTenders close on March 9. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:02:35.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
