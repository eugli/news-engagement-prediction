GETTY IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said Greece will not get a 'sweetheart' deal \nCountries paying less than 10 per cent income tax included Ireland, France, Slovakia and Estonia. \nThe country closest to the Greek figure is Finland at around 20 per cent. \nDespite some countries being small in comparison to Greece - Mr Tsipras’ country has the biggest debt pile in Europe relative to the size of its economy. \nThe IMF has been pushing for Greece to enact long-term reforms of its income tax and pension systems to avoid deficits. \nDespite resistance in the country it is hoped they will be able to come to a suitable arrangement.
