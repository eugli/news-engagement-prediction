Not at all,” he said. \n“I’ve got a thick skin and I’ve been in this game for 30-odd years. I’ve been called a lot worse and been through tougher times. \n“But I think it’s completely inappropriate for my children, my family. On top of that, all those young kids that turned up to the game with their parents to watch the game. I don’t think it has any place in Australian sport. The offending banner is set to land the Wanderers in plenty of trouble. Source: Supplied \n“My family were upset, to the fact where my girls have come to every game of football that I’ve coached and played since I can remember and they don’t want to come anymore. \n“It’s a strong statement from the girls and my wife, my wife is extremely upset. \n“But (I’ve had) no apology, we just have to get on with it. \n“Apology? “I would probably have liked one by now. I haven’t heard from them for four days so I don’t want one now. At the end of the day I would have hoped I would have got an apology, but I didn’t get one. That’s life and we just move on.” Sign up for Sportsmail  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:38:58.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
