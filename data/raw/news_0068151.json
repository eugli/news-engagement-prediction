Related 5 Things We Learned Hanging Out With Paris Jackson Michael Jackson's daughter shares personal anecdotes of life with her late father \nIn the initial lawsuit, which has occupied the courts since 2013, former Jackson associates Broderick Morris, Qadree El-Amin, Adean King, and Raymone Bain claim that the singer promised them a combined 15-percent stake in his company. \nWhile Katherine Jackson has a 10-percent ownership and the role of officer in the Michael Jackson Company following her son's 2009 death, in a motion filed to the California Superior Court in early-February, she asserts that important estate matters have been made without her input. \nThe defendants, John Branca and John McClain, are the executors of Jackson's estate. Lawyers for Branca did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\"Although I am a principal beneficiary of the Michal Jackson Family Trust, I was not informed by the Executors of Mr. Al-Amin's December 20, 2012 letter; nor did the Executors keep me informed on the progress of this action or the progress of the Estate of Jackson case,\" Katherine Jackson wrote in her brief. \nEl-Amin, a \"close friend and confidant of Michael Jackson,\" said in a statement, \"Mrs. Jackson deserves her ownership of The Michael Jackson Company and to make decisions on major company issues. It's what Michael wanted—he trusted her more than anyone. She was left 40 percent of the Michael Jackson Estate and can make Branca and McClain pay her what she is entitled to and demand to be involved in decision making—if they don't she has the power to fire them. They're an amazing disgrace.\" \nAt the crux of Morris, El-Amin, King and Bain's argument against the Jackson estate is a document from May 1st, 2006 meeting in Tokyo with the King of Pop. At the meeting, the first of the \"Board of Directors of the Michael Jackson Company,\" the singer, as chairman of the board, gave himself a 75-percent stake in his own company, with Katherine Jackson and Bain receiving 10-percent. El-Amin, King and Morris were all handed a 1.6-percent share. \nJackson also expressed his desire for his son Prince Jackson to take over as chairman when he completed school. \nIn the lawsuit, the four plaintiffs argue that Branca and McClain \"repudiated\" their ownership stake upon Jackson's death. \nAn April 19th hearing has been set in Los Angeles to determine whether Katherine Jackson can become involved with the lawsuit. \nEarlier this month, Katherine Jackson was granted a restraining order against her nephew Trent Lamar Jackson following accusations of elder abuse.
