While it was great to see the father-son duo having immense fun, Abram's safety was certainly overlooked. To the credit of Shahrukh Khan, he was driving his BMW 6 Series at moderate speeds only. The problem doesn't lie with the car and neither was it an error, which Shahrukh Khan seemed to have overlooked knowingly. The problem lies in the fact that Abram, a 3 year old kid was in the front seat of the car, a place where he shouldn't be for the next 9 odd years. To make things worse, he was being held by a passenger so that he could have an open air experience. \nIn most countries, it's illegal to have children below 12 years seated in the front seats since the seats and the seat belt systems aren't designed to protect such small body frames. Instead, children are supposed to sit in specially-designed child seats, which get fixed to the rear seats using ISOFIX mounts. In the video shot by Movie Talkies, the superstar is seen enjoying a moment with his younger son, Abram wherein he is also held up by the co-driver between the front seats. The potential risk of the child landing up in an injury is exceedingly high and this is also due to the fact that there is no awareness in terms of occupant safety or any law that enforces any commuter to follow rules. \nCelebrities should lead by example and being well travelled also means they're well-aware about such safety issues, which are followed strictly in other countries. It is simply to ask celebrities such as SRK, Salman Khan (when he was riding a superbike without a helmet on public roads) to endorse safety while traveling on the road. 1,46,133 people lost their lives to road accidents in 2015 in India, which amounts to roughly 400 deaths per day. The leading cause for this is driver error, wherein excessive speeding is the single largest culprit. \nVideo: Shahrukh Khan with Abram in their BMW Convertible (Video Courtesy: Movie Talkies) \nThere was an incident during the 2016 Independence Day celebrations when two children on two different vehicles in West Delhi died due to kite strings. Both kids were standing out of the car's sunroof and the drivers, of course could not notice the strings. The strings, which are toughened with powdered glass, slit the throat of the children eventually leading to death even before medical attention could be given to them. These incidents are a clear example of the ignorance amongst road users in India. \nManufacturers have not only enforced but started making people aware about road safety. Hyundai Motor India recently started an ad campaign (Be the Better Guy) which has simple yet hard-hitting messages about the safety of occupants in a car while travelling and not bending or breaking traffic rules. Incidentally, Hyundai's brand ambassador happens to be SRK himself, ironic?
