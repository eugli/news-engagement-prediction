Nuru's brother was the victim of a beating in the 400 block of Climax Street and remains in the Intensive Care Unit. By Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nPittsburgh police said two people have been arrested in connection with the attack of a cab driver, whose beating put members of the local Somali Bantu community on edge. \nPolice announced in a news release that King Edwards and Hosea Moore, both 20, of Beltzhoover, \"called the cab with the intent of robbing the driver.\" They said the pair will face charges of attempted homicide, robbery and conspiracy. \nThe cab driver, whose name and other information has not been released, was found beaten Tuesday in the 400 block of Climax Street in Beltzhoover. Police said today that he was in \"grave condition at a local hospital.\" \n\"The investigation is ongoing; however, there is no evidence that robbery or beating of the driver were motivated by the driver's nationality,\" the police bureau said. \nArrest paperwork for the suspects, which could provide more details of the incident, was not immediately available. \nBantu and other Muslim community leaders held a news conference Thursday morning, saying they saw the beating as a violent manifestation of a wave of discrimination against their populations in recent months. They said such incidents have been stirred up by political rhetoric and policies casting harsh suspicion on them as Muslims and with roots in Somalia, one of seven nations spotlighted by now-suspended travel restrictions promulgated by the Trump administration.
