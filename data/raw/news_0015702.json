In the interim, shipments are happening by truck. (Getty Images) Related Stories Dramatic increase in train traffic through East Vancouver \nCoal mines are restarting in Tumbler Ridge, but companies can't ship to market because train lines maintained by CN Rail have fallen into disrepair. \nMayor Don McPherson says it appears the railway stopped looking after the track sometime in 2015 after the community's last coal mine shut down. \n\"I guess the board of directors for CN Rail decided that they didn't need to maintain the rail line,\" he said. \n\"It came as a surprise to me.\" \nThe discovery comes as there is renewed interest in coal from the northeast B.C. community. \nLast year, Conuma Coal purchased three of the mines and announced plans to rehire many of the 700 people who lost their jobs two years ago. \nThe Brûlé mine, which ships coal by truck to a nearby rail facility, is already operational. The Wolverine coal mine is approximately 25 kilometres south of Tumbler Ridge. (Andrew Kurjata/CBC) \nThe second to start up is the Wolverine mine, which is much closer to Tumbler Ridge than Brûlé. \nIt comes with its own rail facility for direct shipment out of the community. \nThat can't be done, however, without $23 million worth of repairs to the CN Rail lines leading out of the community. Unclear if or when repairs will happen \nCN spokeswoman Kate Fenske confirms the line went out of service because there were no rail movements on it. \n\"Significant investments are needed to resume rail service to any potential new customer,\" she wrote in an email. For [CN] to make a decision that affects a community I think is a little above what a private company should do. - Tumbler Ridge mayor Don McPherson \n\"We can acknowledge active discussion with local officials and potential customer but decline to give specifics.\" \nMcPherson said in his talks with CN it seems there isn't much interest in getting the line up and running in the immediate future. \nIn the short-term, coal can be shipped by truck but the single-lane road out of town can't maintain that sort of traffic for long. \nMcPherson also said there are other possible mine restarts that won't happen unless the rail line is operational. \nHe feels as if Tumbler Ridge is being \"held hostage\" by CN. \n\"That's the lifeblood of this town.
