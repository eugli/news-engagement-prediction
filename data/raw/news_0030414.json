Stacey Kirk \nNZ First leader Winston Peters accepted the petition from Judy Richards (left), and Mike Middleton, whose son Rhys Middleton was killed by a foreign driver in 2016. \nREAD MORE: \n\"I was having a cup of tea on a Saturday morning and my son called and says 'mum, this is a phone call no mum wants to hear. Rhys is dead - foreign driver,\" said Richards. \n\"What do you do? Your life just drains - unless you've walked in these shoes, you'll never understand.\" JOHN COWPLAND \nMike Middleton and Judy Richards, parents of killed motorcyclist Rhys Middleton. \nOn Tuesday Richards and Middleton delivered an 8000-strong petition to Parliament, to have all foreign drivers put through a practical driving test if they intended to stay in the country for more than three months. \n\"[Transport Minister] Simon Bridges has got to change his mind,\" said Middleton, as he broke down. \n\"If he lost a child tomorrow, or a family member, he'd be on to this.\" NZN VIDEO \nTesting foreign drivers is not practical: Bill English \nRichards said Rhys was to be married last weekend, and had just brought his first home with his partner when he was killed in a crash caused by Chinese national Jieling Xiao, 27. Ad Feedback \nShe pleaded guilty in court to dangerous driving causing death and was jailed for 17 months last year. \nXiao had professed a lack of confidence behind the wheel during the trial. The crash occurred when she drove her Toyota Rav 4 completely off the road before veering back directly into the path of Middleton's motorbike bike, which had been travelling behind her. Stacey Kirk \nJudy Richards and Mike Middleton speak on the steps of parliament, as they seek to petition MPs. \nHis parents' petition was accepted by NZ First leader Winston Peters, who criticised Bridges for comments that testing foreign drivers would be a \"knee-jerk reaction\". \n\"They're talking about hundreds of people who have lost their lives, thousands of accidents in the last two years, and he doesn't want to do a thing. \n\"When he puts the NZTA up as the authority - pray tell, what is their authority? Have a look at some of the roads in this country, have a look at some of the developments they've agreed to go ahead with. \n\"It is a case of political appointees, covering the bum of the Government. And frankly, what we ought to do is get rid of them,\" said Peters. \nBridges said his sympathies went out to all families who had lost loved ones, but testing foreign drivers was not something he was willing to consider. \n\"I think ultimately though, when you look across the figures what they show is that foreign drivers aren't causing accidents across our roads, there aren't deaths as a result of foreign drivers at a higher rate proportionately than Zealanders. \n\"The other factor, given all of that, is as a New Zealander when I'm in the UK or Australia I expect to go and drive on their roads, and so I think that reciprocity in the absence of very strong evidence that this is a factor over and above New Zealanders' driving issues, means this isn't something we'll be looking at.\" \nHe was backed up by Prime Minister Bill English, who said it was not practical to test every driver when they came to New Zealand. Others said it was flawed to only target those who were on a visa of longer than three months. \nLabour leader Andrew Little said he supported the idea of some kind of \"induction\" as opposed to a full license test would be more practical. \n\"I think there is a case to say there's got to be a good, effective induction at the time they pick up the vehicle and if the buy a vehicle it's a lot harder. \n\"I think I full drivers' test goes beyond what is necessary to ensure safer driving.\" \nBut a three-hour online test of New Zealand's road rules was practical, he said. \nLabour transport spokeswoman Sue Moroney said she supported the petition's intent, and believed there was a need to \"tighten up the regime\". \n\"At the moment, there's a loophole that exists where people can come into the country, be here for up to 12 months, and then go to Australia for a weekend, come back and they qualify all over again for not having to sit a licence for another 12 months - that's a loophole that definitely needs closing.\" \nMoroney did not support mandatory tests for short-term visitors, but said most countries required foreign drivers to fulfil licensing requirements after six months. \nDespite Government opposition to the move, the petition will go through the formal select committee hearing process before the MPs on the committee make a decision. \nThe Transport Select Committee voted against progressing a similar petition in 2015, which was brought by 10-year-old Cody Roberts, whose father was killed by a foreign driver. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:46:30.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
