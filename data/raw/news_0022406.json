Research shows that an increase in the use of body cameras by police has led to a huge drop in complaints made against officers Credit: PA \nT eachers turn on the cameras during incidents in the classroom to tackle “constant low-level disruption”, the cameras’ manufacturer told the newspaper. \nPupils are verbally notified before the devices are turned on said Tom Ellis, a lecturer in criminal justice at Portsmouth University. \nThey also have outward facing screens so pupils are aware they are being filmed and can see the footage live. \nHowever the footage – which is encrypted – is only saved once the teacher hits the record button. \nThe Information Commissioner’s Office – the body responsible for privacy regulation – told the Times that there was no issue with schools using cameras as long as they complied with the data protection act. The 1961 act states that surveillance must be legitimate, proportionate and necessary. \nIt is understood the footage could be used to provide evidence for disciplinary action as well as to share with parents. \nBody cameras have become a common feature of police uniforms since they were rolled out to all frontline police officers in London last year and research has suggested they have been effective at moderating behaviour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:06:59.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
