(Matt Dunham, AP) Well, we let Mugabe in: UK foreign sec compares Trump to Zim president \nLondon - The British government says US President Donald Trump's state visit is still on, despite a groundswell of public and political opposition. \nThousands of people have demonstrated and more than 1.8 million have signed an online petition against the visit since Prime Minister Theresa May extended the invitation last month on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II. \nHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow set aside his customary political neutrality to say that Trump should not be invited to address Parliament during the trip. \nResponding to the anti-Trump petition on Tuesday, the Foreign Office said it \"recognised the strong views ... but does not support this petition\". \nIt said \"we look forward to welcoming President Trump once dates and arrangements are finalised\". \nLawmakers will hold a non-binding debate on the petition on Monday.
