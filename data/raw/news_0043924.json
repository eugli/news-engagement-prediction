More videos Turnbull savings plan in tatters \nThe Labor party and crossbenchers are banding together to thwart the government's plan to increase childcare funding that means cuts to other welfare payments. \nFor not much more money than someone who stacks supermarket shelves, these people have read to our children, taught them their letters and numbers, wiped their noses and bottoms, kissed their grazed knees, cuddled them when they are sad, praised their achievements, indulged their passions, taken them on excursions and loved them. \nThey have been their guides through the most important years of their lives, the crucial 0 to 5 years, which any child development expert will tell you is critical for raising happy kids who are ready, willing and able to flourish at school and beyond. SHARE The government is seeking to reduce the cost of childcare. Photo: Andrew Meares \nAny success our children attain in life will have its foundation in the high quality care and education they received before they started big school. \nBut the years of childcare have come with a hefty price tag – $60,000 or about $10,000 a year for the past six years. Advertisement \nThat's a conservative estimate and after the 50 per cent childcare rebate (which is a misnomer because, as any parent knows, unless your child attends childcare only two days a week the rebate no longer covers half the cost of care). \nI do not begrudge the cost in any way. SHARE Childcare costs have risen significantly over the past two decades. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nIt allowed my husband and I to continue working in jobs we both enjoy. \nOur children were fortunate enough to attend a not-for-profit centre where staff were paid above award wages (which isn't saying much) and treated as professionals. SHARE Childcare changes have been a focus for the Turnbull government. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nWe also owned property before we had children, so we did not have to plot my fertility against rising house prices on a chart that could never tell us the right answer to the question of when to start a family. \nIn short, we're very fortunate. \nAnd yet when the final figure came up on the calculator's LED screen we both winced. \nHad anyone told us that's how much childcare would cost before we had children I'm not sure what we would have done. \nLike most people we were blissfully ignorant and made it work as we went along. \nOur experience is far from unique. \nAbout 1.7 million children aged 12 and under attend some kind of childcare. \nThe industry has exploded over the past three decades as the traditional family model of mum looking after the kids while dad went to work went out out the door, just like video players, hypercolour T shirts, manageable commuting times and affordable house prices. \nSuccessive governments have struggled to keep up with this fundamental social change. \nJohn Howard introduced the initial version of the system we have today. \nThe Rudd/Gillard governments increased funding and beefed up quality standards for centres and staff. \nSince the Coalition came to office in 2013 nothing has changed other than prices – which keep going up – and waiting lists you need to join as soon as you're pregnant if you are to have even a faint hope of finding a childcare place some time around the time you need to go back to work. \nThe changes the Turnbull government desperately wants to get through the Senate are not child focussed either. \nThey're parent focussed and go a long way to making the system more affordable (although not more accessible) for families. \nThey're about reaping the taxation benefits of getting more parents to do more (taxable) work. \nThey could be about what's best for children and how critical it is that they receive good quality education from a very young age, particularly for childcare from disadvantaged backgrounds. \nBut they're not.
