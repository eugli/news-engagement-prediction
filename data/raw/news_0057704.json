'in the process' of trying to trade for Paul George By: Ryan Ward AXS Contributor Feb 22, 2017 2 hours ago 225 225 16541761 6 y2017m02d22 115049 NBA \nIn day two of the new Los Angeles Lakers regime, following the trade to send Lou Williams to the Houston Rockets, Magic Johnson is reportedly busy trying to land the team's next superstar. \nAccording to Sam Amick of USA Today , the Lakers appear to be attempting to acquire forward Paul George from the Indiana Pacers: \n\"George will be a free agent in the summer of 2018, and itâ€™s no secret that the 26-year-old Palmdale, Calif. native would love nothing more than to sign with his hometown Lakers if the future is bleak in Indiana. The fact that the Lakers are in the process of trying to land George right now, with new lead executive Magic Johnson moving fast to fill that superstar hole that Kobe Bryant left behind, only makes these next two days all the more compelling.\" \nThe Lakers have been desperately looking for Kobe's successor as the face of the franchise for quite some time. D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram, and Julius Randle are being groomed to be stars of the future in Los Angeles, but there's no telling whether they'll reach superstar status or if they'll ever be anything more than complimentary players. \nGeorge, however, is a legitimate superstar. The perennial All-Star is currently the face of the Pacers and arguably one of the best players in the league at his position. Also, George is getting impatient with the Pacers brass as he wants to be able to compete with the league's elite teams and is barely over .500 right now with a record of 29-28 heading into the All-Star break. \nThe Pacers made an effort to upgrade their roster over the last couples of years with the additions of Jeff Teague, Monta Ellis, Thaddeus Young, Al Jefferson and the emergence of Myles Turner. \nIndiana is likely looking to bolster the roster around George ahead of the NBA trade deadline on Feb. 23, but if a move can't be made to upgrade, president Larry Bird and company may seriously consider a deal with the Lakers or another team like the Celtics.
