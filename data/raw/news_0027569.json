In observance of the day, a catchy music video made by the non-profit Integrate U.K. assumed particular pertinence. In the video, titled “#MyClitoris,” a group of girls challenge the constant policing of the female body by society and the media, and reassert control over their own bodies. Putting it frankly the girls sing, “Seems it’s up to us girls to be quite tough … If we need to spell it out, get your mitts off my muff.” \nWhile there is virtual unanimity amongst experts that FGM should be outlawed, and although the UN passed a resolution back in 2012 banning the abuse within its 194 UN Member States, the practice is still widespread.
