Kennedy Jr. \nSaturday, February 25, 2017 by: JD Heyes Tags: autisim , Robert De Niro , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , Thimerosal , vaccines \n( Natural News ) Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is no stranger to controversy. As one of the country’s leading voices against the corporatism of medicine and the federal government’s collusion with Big Pharma to bring dangerous, mind- and body-altering drugs to the market in the name of profits, he’s on another crusade today. \nJoined by Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro, the pair has teamed up with the World Mercury Project, which Kennedy runs, to reveal the truth about the presence of the heavy metal in vaccines. \nIn an open letter to journalists published by EcoWatch , both men publicized the WMP’s $100,000 challenge to any journalist who can produce a peer-reviewed scientific study to prove that mercury-laced thimerosal, an ingredient in many vaccines, is safe . (RELATED: Religious Vaccine Exemptions Explode More Than 50% In New Jersey ) \n“We especially want to reach out to those of you who have made a point of assuring the public about the safety of the mercury -based preservative, thimerosal . It’s our hope that this challenge will elevate this important debate beyond name calling and prompt a genuine examination of the relevant science,” they wrote in their letter. “The American public is entitled to an honest, probing and vigorous discussion about this critical public health issue—a debate based on facts, not rooted in fear, or on blind faith in regulators and the pharmaceutical industry.” \nAs noted by Natural News , by comparison, several peer-reviewed studies have found that thimerosal is a potent neurotoxin. Not only that, recent studies have upheld earlier conclusions that mercury is most definitely a neurotoxin . Finally, a study by Yale University and the Penn State College of Medicine concluded recently that there is an association between vaccines and brain disorders . \nDe Niro, by the way, has a son who is autistic, which he says his wife noticed very soon after he received vaccines. \nFor his part, RFK Jr. has very little faith in government institutions like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ever standing up for the truth, because there are too many Big Pharma corporate interests involved in suppressing it. \n“Instead of questioning, digging and investigating, journalists, too often, have taken the easy course of repeating the safety assurances of the pharmaceutical industry and the regulators at CDC’s Immunization Safety Office, which they have good reason to doubt,” he and De Niro wrote. \nKennedy has called the CDC “a cesspool of corruption” for failing, time and again, to do the right thing for Americans and for science in helping expose the link between brain damage and thimerosal-laced vaccines, which he has said hit poor, ethnic minority children the worst since it is most often included in the cheapest vaccines used at publicly-funded urban clinics. \n“The head of the CDC is saying there is no connection between thimerosal and autism . I will challenge [them] to show me a single study that actually says that. In fact, I’ve put out a challenge that I will give any journalist who can show me a single study that shows that thimerosal is safe $10,000 — and there are literally hundreds and hundreds of studies,” Kennedy said, as reported by Newsmax . \n“There are four federal studies that have looked at CDC and said the vaccine program at CDC is a cesspool of corruption,” added the author of the recent book, “ Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak .” (RELATED: Study Confirms That All Vaccines Are Toxic ) \nFor the Yale and Penn State study, researchers analyzed more than five years’ worth of private health insurance data on kids ages 6-15 and found that children vaccinated three-to-12 months prior were more likely to have been diagnosed with some form of neurological disorder. \nIn all, more than 95,000 children had been diagnosed with one of seven neuropsychiatric disorders: anorexia nervosa, anxiety disorder, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorder. \nKennedy and De Niro have said they support and believe in the overall efficacy of vaccinations, but that the country and the world deserve to know the truth about thimerosal in vaccines and its reported link to neurological problems. \nJ.D.
