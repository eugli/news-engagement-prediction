ADVERTISEMENT \n“Mahirap. Kailangan pala talagang maging responsible ka. One time nga, kinakatok ako ng Meralco kasi nakalimutan ko palang magbayad ng kuryente. Sabi ko, ‘Huwag po.’ Hahahaha!” she said. \nSince she is living alone with no house help, she is still adjusting to the independent life. \n“Kasi gusto ko talaga mag-isa para mapilitan akong matutong magluto. Ang tigas na nga ng kamay ko sa mga gawaing bahay. Hahahaha!” she said at the press conference for the GMA News TV program “Day Off,” which she co-hosts with fellow Kapuso actor Ken Chan. \nSometimes, she calls on their family house help in their Fairview home whenever she needs extra hands for errands that she can’t do by herself. \nBesides “Day Off,” which airs every Saturday at 6:15 p.m. on GMA News TV, Janine is also preparing for the launch of her upcoming series on GMA 7, “Legally Blind,” which also stars Mikael Daez, Lauren Young, Rodjun Cruz, Marc Abaya, Chanda Romero, Therese Malvar, Lucho Ayala, Ashley Rivera and Camille Torres.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:36:26.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
