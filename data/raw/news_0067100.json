As of Thursday morning, after rains rolled in to saturate much of the state, the area considered in drought by the site was just under 17 percent. \nJim Mathews, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sacramento, said that while this is remarkable, it's not entirely surprising. \n\"When you start learning about weather, you're told most droughts end in flash floods,\" Mathews said. \"That's how it works.\" Floodwaters surround homes and cars on February 22, 2017, in San Jose, California. NOAH BERGER / AFP - Getty Images \nEven though It's a significant step in the right direction, meteorologists warn that the state turns green, damage below the surface still lurks. \n\"People talk about the surface drought being over, but we still have a lot of problems underground in terms of replenishing water supplies,\" Eric Boldt, warning coordination meteorologist for NOAA's Los Angeles/Oxnard office, said. \nMathews said it's this factor that could cause a hydrologist and meteorologist to have different opinions about where California stands in terms of the drought. \nHe said the concept is water supply versus rainfall: while a vast improvement is made on the surface, ground levels of water could still be affected long after the visual signs of the drought have disappeared. \nCurrently, both Northern and Southern California are weathering extreme storms and flooding, but in the south — despite images of cities like San Jose being washed out — some areas are still falling below the average water accumulation by as much as 26 percent, Boldt said. \nNeither Boldt nor Mathews suggested the extreme drought followed by severe flooding in California is an anomaly. \n\"Southern California especially is like the stock market; we go up in hurry and we go down in hurry. We have extremes,\" Boldt said. \nMathews said occasionally the north and south of California will have different weather events and drought conditions, but on average, the state stays uniform. \n\"Generally speaking, the state goes through periods of real wet and real dry weather,\" Mathews said. \"You could always break it down to southern and northern, but, generally speaking, the state experiences the extremes either way.\" A boy looks onto flooded Nordale Avenue in San Jose, Calif., Wednesday, Feb. 22, 2017. Jeff Chiu / AP \nBoth conditions bring their own set of challenges. \nShort-term problems in times of high precipitation include rivers and streams slamming aged and idled levees, which can break or become damaged after long periods of inactivity. In the summer, the long-term issue is caused when snow melt inflow raises the water level of reservoirs and again puts pressure on the levees. \nThe issues during the drought are self-explanatory Mathews said: There's no water. \nBut right now, as welcomed rain trounces the Golden State, that worry is starting to fade. \n\"It's extraordinary to see an improvement in the drought in a short amount of time,\" Mathews said. \"A decrease in drought severity has been a sigh of relief.\" Kalhan Rosenblatt ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:00:08.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
