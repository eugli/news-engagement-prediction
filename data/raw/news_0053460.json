They then conducted a floor-by-floor sweep. \n“We have not found any evidence of a shooter yet,” Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo told reporters outside the hospital. “We have not found anyone injured. We have not found a suspect.” \nHe added there were multiple witnesses who said they heard two large bangs and someone yell “drop the gun.” \nHe added: “I can’t say that there was no shooting. If there was a threat, that threat is not present here now.” \nThe hospital has returned to normal operations, he said, adding SWAT officers will stay for several hours as a precaution. \nLive aerial coverage from Houston television station KHOU showed officers outside the facility, with several drawing their weapons, and patients on gurneys being wheeled out. \nJames and Alma Delacruz were in the hospital’s emergency room when panic set in on reports of the shooter. Staff blocked some doors with furniture and tried to remove patients through others, they said. \n“I was really scared,” Alma Delacruz said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:11:19.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
