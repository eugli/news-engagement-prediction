British suicide bomber behind Mosul attack \nBut he added: \"I think the intensity and the potential frequency of serious plot planning... represents an enormous ongoing risk that none of us can ignore. \n\"So I think that there is undoubtedly significant ongoing risk which is at least as great as the threat to London in the 1970s when the IRA were active on the mainland.\" \nHe highlighted the numbers of British people travelling to Iraq and Syria to fight for IS. \n\"It's an enormous concern that large numbers - we know this means at least hundreds of British citizens who have left this country in order to fight - are now returning or may be about to return\".

'Risk not detectable' \nMr Hill said ministers who approved a reported Â£1m of compensation for al-Harith - formerly known as Ronald Fiddler - could not have known the man would later join IS. \nAl-Harith, 50 and from Manchester, was sent to Guantanamo Bay in 2002. \nEarlier this month, IS said he detonated a car bomb at an Iraqi army base in Tal Gaysum, south-west of Mosul.
