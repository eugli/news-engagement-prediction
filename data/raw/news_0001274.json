The force did not specify which police station he was interviewed at. \nThe interview took place on Saturday morning. \nAn inquest into Palmer's death concluded he was unlawfully killed. Police have said his shooting had \"all the hallmarks of a professional hit\". Image copyright PA Image caption The former scrap metal dealer was known for his involvement in the Brink's-Mat robbery \nThe robbery in 1983 took place at Heathrow Airport when £25m worth of gold was stolen. At the time is was the biggest robbery to have ever taken place in the UK . \nThe former scrap metal dealer, from Olton, near Birmingham, who was one of seven children, was said to have melted the metal down in the back garden of his mansion at Landsdown near Bath. \nHowever, he denied knowing it was stolen and was acquitted in 1987, blowing kisses to the jury from the dock when the verdict was delivered. \nWorth about £500m in today's prices, most of the gold has never been recovered and the case remains open. \nIn 1997 Palmer was arrested in Tenerife, and returned to the UK to face charges related to a large-scale timeshare fraud. \nIn May 2001 was sentenced to eight years in prison and ordered to pay a record confiscation order of £33m.
