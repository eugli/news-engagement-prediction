Assuming the song was about her, Remy fired back with “ShETHER,” dragging Nicki for—among other things—allegedly having sex with Ebro Darden and Trey Songz and financially supporting her brother after he was accused of child molestation . However, some fans think that “Make Love” wasn’t meant as a diss towards Remy, but Azealia Banks . \nOn Facebook , Nicki Minaj fan Jamell Lewis laid out the case for “Make Love” actually being an Azealia Banks diss track. Back in December, Banks posted a lengthy rant directed at Nicki, which she deleted just a few hours later. In her post, Banks mocked Nicki’s weight and said that she needs to stop calling herself the queen of rap: \nSince Nicki never mentioned any names on “Make Love,” it’s impossible to tell exactly who she was dissing, but several lines could be interpreted as responses to Azealia Banks. On her verse, Nicki raps: She ain’t eatin' but I swear she got some bum ass tasteText her man like, “Dawg, how that bum ass taste?” \nThe phrase “bum ass taste” sounds like a reference to Banks' debut album, Broke With Expensive Taste . Despite the hype that surrounded her following the success of her 2011 single “212,” Banks' debut album sold just 11,000 copies in its first week. It seems like Nicki is mocking Banks' album sales and referencing her Facebook diss later in the verse: Oooohhh, oh you the qu-e-e-the queen of this here?One platinum plaque, album flopped, bitch, where? \n“212” is not technically certified Platinum in the U.S.—although it is in Britain—but the song racked up over 130 million YouTube views in an era when streams were not counted as part of sales figures and is considered to be a major success. \nOn the track, Nicki also drops a line about her rival not being able to afford rent: Pay your rent! And stay in your bum ass place \nEarly this year, rumors emerged that Banks is broke and has been begging her friends for money to cover living expenses. \nBanks even inserted herself into the beef with a series of now-deleted tweets: \nhttps://twitter.com/adrivnnx/status/835894498521661441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw \nEven if the verse was meant to be a shot at Azealia Banks, Remy Ma’s savage response track all but guarantees that Nicki won’t admit it. Still, it’s interesting to see how the record could be interpreted in a completely different way than Remy took it.
