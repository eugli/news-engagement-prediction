You don't think there's anything wrong with that?\"\nPriebus denied that Vice President Mike Pence did not know for 14 days that he had been misled by Flynn on matters related to that conversation.\n\"What the vice president did not know, I believe, was that Sally Gates gave an initial heads up to Don McGahn. But once the next day came, that investigation was closed, Chris. That topic did not come up again. This whole conversation shifted to whether or not Michael Flynn was honest with the vice president. He was looped in on the conversation, and it was determined that he was not. That was it,\" Priebus said.\nAlso   FEC Democrat to depart, giving Trump a chance to add a conservative: Report Ann Ravel said she will send the president her letter of resignation this week\nBy Jacqueline Klimas • 02/19/17 10:47 AM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T18:59:08.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
