Frank Wycheck (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:23 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 6:23 p.m. ET \nFrank Wycheck was selected to the Pro Bowl three times in 11 NFL seasons. \nBut after catching 505 passes for 5,126 yards and 28 touchdowns, the former Redskins and Titans tight end is certain he now has chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. \nMORE: Junior Seau's team doctor accused of neglect \n\"From 5 until I was done at 33, and I added it up to 297 thousand collisions,\" Wycheck, now 45 years old, told Nashville Fox television affiliate WZTV . \"I was a linebacker and I was a running back, so I was hitting with my head every single time. \n\"Of those, 25 were concussions. The blows are irreversible. ... Migraine headaches, just being depressed, just not wanting to socialize, sensitivity to light. I go into a room and forget why I went there.\" \nOriginally a sixth-round pick out of Maryland by the Redskins in 1993, Wycheck signed with the Houston Oilers in 1995 and moved with the team to Tennessee as the Oilers transitioned to the Titans. He was selected to the Pro Bowl for three straight seasons, from 1998-2000 and retired following the 2003 season. He is perhaps best known for throwing the lateral pass in the \"Music City Miracle\" to beat the Bills in the 1999 AFC playoffs. \nWycheck said he is \"sure\" he has CTE because of \"the punishment\" he took and his multiple concussions, along with other \"dings.\" \n\"You can't test for CTE unless you're dead,\" he added before mentioning that former Chargers linebacker Junior Seau committed suicide in 2012 but was later diagnosed with CTE. \n\"Junior Seau, what caused him one day to put a shot gun to his chest and pull the trigger?\" Wycheck asked. \"As former players, you're like, ‘When is that going to happen to me?’ Is there a special pill I can take? Do I eat carrots? What do I do to prevent perhaps what is inevitable? That's a stress that is on your mind daily.\" \nEven with the knowledge he now has on the dangers of football, Wycheck said he \"wouldn't change a thing\" because \"that's the price you pay.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:39:24.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
