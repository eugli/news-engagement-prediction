They released debut record If You Wait in September 2013 and released their first piece of new music - “Rooting for You” - on 1 January 2017.\nCurrently, the only confirmed acts include headliners Radiohead as well as Wiley and The Avalanches; Foo Fighters and Ed Sheeran are both strongly rumoured to complete the headline bill with Michael and Emily Eavis confirming that a full lineup announcement is due to be made next month.\nThe organisers also revealed a new area that'll launch at this year's Festival which will be the last until 2019 due to the planned fallow year.\nSpin-off event the Variety Bazaar will take place in a different location in 2021.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/londongrammar", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Glasto2017?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/James_Brighton/status/834169682022236162", "https://twitter.com/NiamhRK/status/834197516795133953", "https://twitter.com/joessnell/status/834179065615613957", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Glastonbury?src=hash"], "published": "2017-02-22T11:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:38:53.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
