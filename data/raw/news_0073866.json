This is the Heidi doll the thief had it away with (Photo: MEN WS) \nHe then finally fled back through the hole in the roof with only the doll in his possession. \nOwner Alan Brook told the Manchester Evening News : “I don’t see a need to break in. We are cheap enough. Don’t be shy. Give us a try.” \nWhen Alan arrived at the shop the morning after the theft last Sunday, he found the DVD the man had watched was still playing on a loop, and realised what had happened. \nHe also found all the items were still in the shop, except for the Heidi doll, although the box it sits in was left behind by the burglar. \nAlan said: \"There’s a lot of valuable stuff here he could have taken, like a computer and DVD player and a £10,000 photocopier. \n\"There must be £25,000 of kit in there but that doll was the only thing that was taken. \n\"It makes me wonder whether somebody has broken in just to steal that doll. That’s certainly the impression the police gave me. \n“It’s obvious they’ve also been watching porn on the office computer, the cheeky bugger. But apart from the damage, nothing else has been stolen. \n“It’s probably cost me £1,500 to fix the roof and the ceiling.” \nHe added: “I’ve been here 42 years and we’ve only been robbed a couple of times. \n\"Once someone came through the shop window and took a load of DVDs. But on this occasion they’ve only taken one item.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:06:53.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
