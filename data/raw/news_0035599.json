Although it's relatively common, many people are not aware they have it. \n\"The study found energy drinks can cause two main things - alter the blood pressure and also alter the rhythm of the heart,\" said cardiologist Dr Chris Semsarian, one of the authors of the study. \nThat can cause very serious problems and even death.\" Skip YouTube Video FireFox NVDA users - To access the following content, press 'M' to enter the iFrame. \nIn the study, people with Long QT Syndrome were given Red Bull. One in eight experienced a faster heart rate and the rhythm became more erratic. \n\"It changes the normal rhythm of the heart to a rhythm that can lead to bad problems - it didn't actually cause the problems themselves.\" \nHe pointed out that in the study patients were given only one can each of Red Bull, but often people drink up to five in one night. He said it was not known what specific ingredient, or combination of ingredients, was causing the heart problems. \n\"The caffeine contributes, but it's a combination of caffeine being drunk quickly, as well as taurine and guarana and further stimulants. \n\"We also don't know what some of those drinks have in them.\" Calls for ban on sales to under-18s \nEnergy drinks have been under the spotlight for the last few years. \nIn the United States, a class action lawsuit is being brought against the energy drink company Monster on behalf of people who have suffered \"serious, permanent and life-altering injuries as a result of regular consumption,\" according to the prosecuting law firm. \nIt follows other lawsuits against Mother. In 2013, the parent of a Californian teenager who died from cardiac arrhythmia sued the company, alleging the death was the result of her son drinking two cans of Monster Energy daily for three years. In 2015, the wife of a man who died after drinking one can of Monster Energy every day for two weeks sued Monster. Both cases settled out of court.
