PUBLISHED: 10:43,  45, Thu, Feb 9, 2017 \nThe far-right candidate has promised to put France first by ridding it from the “tyrannies” of globalisation, Islamic fundamentalism and the European Union . \nHer campaign centres around the pledge she will dump the bloc’s currency and put an end to Islamic terror , which she says poses a great threat to the European nation. \nIan Bremmer, President of New York-based Eurasia Group, claims it is looking more likely Ms Le Pen will be able to deliver on her promises as the EU moves further away from its ideal of a “supranational identity”. \nHe said that the Continent’s financiers are petrified a victory for the French National Front leader would cause irreparable damage to the euro. GETTY Marine Le Pen has been backed to deliver 'Frexit' because France is 'less Western' Nobody wants Le Pen to win because they believe that would have significant implications for the euro Ian Bremmer \nSpeaking on Fox News , he said: “The interesting thing, nobody in the markets wants Marine Le Pen to win because they believe that would have significant further implications for the euro and European economy. \n“She is saying she would want the French to be out [of the EU] and I think there is a chance that she will win. \n“[The EU] were trying to get all of these countries to join, saying the integration is going to bring them closer politically over time. \n“They are going to look more alike. They are going to create a creation of a European supranational identity. FOX Ian Bremmer, a top political scientist, however, said she struggle for support in France's congress \n“It’s very clear that Turkey – a candidate member – looks less like the West than it did 10 years ago, that’s true of Hungary, Slovakia and Romania and it might well be true, shortly, in France too.” \nMr Bremmer insisted the developing split between European member states is the catalyst behind Ms Le Pen’s support, which has seen her surge in several recent polls. \n“The alliance is proving to be far more ambitious than you could actually operationalise on the ground – and the people are reacting very badly to that idea,” he added.
