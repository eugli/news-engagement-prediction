But the whole experience — coupled with his own daughter and her friends' struggles with addiction — compelled O'Leary to issue a public plea, warning parents about the dangers of opioid addiction.\nCity urging NYE partygoers to pick up overdose kits\nNaloxone kits a struggle to find in Ottawa, despite councillor's urging\nSean O'Leary said Sunday that the teen's overdose and the sudden effects of the naloxone injection have changed his and his family's life forever.\n\"It was amazing. Once he was injected with that, it was just like, boom, back to life,\" O'Leary recalled.\nThe boy was a friend of his 16-year-old daughter Paige, who one week earlier had returned home after spending almost three months seeking treatment for drug addiction.\n\"I was terrified. That was definitely one of the scariest nights of my life,\" she told CBC News. \"I really didn't know what was going to happen.\"\n'We can't fix the whole drug problem, but we've got to find a way as a community to keep our kids from dying.' - Sean O'Leary On Friday, O'Leary wrote his open letter, pointing out there have been a number of recent overdoses in Kanata and urging parents to be on alert.\nHe also thinks there needs to be more withdrawal beds available for teenagers to use while they're waiting to get into drug treatment.\n\"We can't fix the whole drug problem, but we've got to find a way as a community to keep our kids from dying,\" said O'Leary.\nPaige O'Leary said she got addicted to counterfeit percocets after taking them for two weeks. She says they cost about $5 a pill and are easily accessible in Kanata if you know where to look. (CBC)\nParents of addicts respond to letter Over the past few days, the letter has been shared widely on Facebook. O'Leary said the response he's received has been overwhelming.\nA meeting is now being planned for Thursday night to bring parents of addicts together so they can discuss how they can work together to help their kids. The details are still being worked out, but O'Leary said Ottawa Public Health will be involved so that parents can learn how to use naloxone kits in case they ever need to save their child's life.\n\"These kids have a word for it, and it's called 'nodding off.' They just go to sleep, they nod off,\" said O'Leary, adding the drug of choice for his daughter and her friends are blue counterfeit Percocets — which public health officials have warned can sometimes be laced with the deadly opioid fentanyl.\nOttawa police, public health issue warning about fake prescription meds\n\"You can kill yourself with drugs but [in the past] it usually took some effort,\" said O'Leary.\n\"These kids can just do a few Percs at home in their bed at night ... and they go to sleep and they stop breathing. And their heart stops and they're dead.\"\nOverdosing becoming more common Chloe Clark, another friend of Paige O'Leary, told CBC News she overdosed on a mix of Xanax and Percocets about a week ago.\nThe 17-year-old said that while she doesn't remember being revived, she was told another teenager saved her life with naloxone.\n\"I need drugs to sleep, I need drugs to wake up in the morning, I need drugs to do stuff during the day. I need Percocets to live a normal life and it sucks,\" said Clark, who is set to start treatment in Ottawa on Tuesday.\nFriends Paige O'Leary, left, and Chloe Clark snap a photo just days before Chloe heads to the Dave Smith Youth Treatment Centre to seek help for her drug addiction. (CBC)\nPaige O'Leary, who is still trying to quit drugs, said she's happy her dad is raising awareness about what's going on in Kanata.\nShe said the counterfeit Percocets that got her addicted cost about $5 a pill and are easy to find in Kanata if you know where to look.\n\"Not everyone is dying, but everyone is overdosing. It's crazy,\" she said. \"It's a really big problem and it needs to stop.\"\nHer dad said he's hopeful parents can set their shame aside and work together to take care of each other's children.\n\"Every time these kids are doing drugs, they're playing Russian roulette,\" Sean O'Leary said.\n\"If there's 40 families of addicts watching out for my daughter, there's more chance my daughter's going to live than if there's just me trying to make sure she stays alive.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:25:20.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
