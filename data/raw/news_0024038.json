And since fire is the symbol of power, the director tentatively called the film – Dragon , though he is yet to finalise the title. At the premiere of the Oscar-nominated film Moonlight on Tuesday, Mukerji spoke about his film which is tentatively titled Dragon . Mukerji, who earlier directed Ranbir in films Wake Up Sid (2009) and the 2013 blockbuster Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani , said, “We’ve not yet locked the title. It is tentatively called Dragon. Somehow the word got out and everybody started asking me about the film’s progress.” \nExplaining the reason behind the title, he said, “The boy has some mystical connection with fire. Fire is the symbol of power so, I called it Dragon . Let’s see. I am not 100 per cent sure about the title, but I like something about it.” The director shared that rather than a superhero film, he would like to call the movie a modern-day fantasy love story.
