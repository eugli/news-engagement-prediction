Missing out \nCitizens Advice said that 72,000 women were missing out on auto-enrolment pensions, which require employers to pay a pension automatically, unless a worker deliberately opts out. \nThe charity said too many people were being shut out of the opportunity to be paid a pension. \n\"Many people - particularly women - work several part time jobs, which helps them manage commitments like childcare or study,\" said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. \n\"But while in many cases they earn over £10,000, and pay tax on this combined income, they don't have access to a workplace pension and miss out on the opportunity to save for their retirement.\" Image copyright Thinkstock How to get a pension of £20,000 by the time you retire Shortfall \nThe government said in December that it would examine the issue of workers with multiple jobs when it reviews the auto-enrolment programme later this year. \n\"There's more to do - especially for people with more than one job - and we're currently reviewing the policy to see how it can be improved,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said. \nThe Zurich analysis found that between 2013 and 2016 men received 7.8% of their salary in pension contributions on average, compared to women receiving 7%. \nIt said men tend to work in sectors with more established or generous pension schemes. \nIn addition, women are more likely to take career breaks. \n\"This difference in the contributions that they receive from their employer presents a serious - and growing - problem,\" said Rose St Louis, Zurich's head of partnership development. \n\"The triple effect of smaller salaries, career breaks for women and lower contribution rates needs to be addressed: we can't ignore a £47,000 shortfall,\" she said.
