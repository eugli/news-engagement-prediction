This difference is about the same amount that would be burnt off by a brisk half-an-hour walk, experts discovered. \nResearchers at Tufts University in Massachusetts took two groups of people and fed them diets similar in total energy, total fat and the number of fruit, vegetable and protein servings.

One group ate wholegrains such as brown rice and whole wheat, while the other consumed white rice and refined white flour. \nThey found that the diet with more wholegrains led to people developing a faster metabolism, burning more calories. They also absorbed fewer calories in their digestive systems. Obesity is a global problem and must never be neglected.

Numbers of beneficial gut bacteria were also found to increase. \nThe study was conducted over eight weeks with 81 men and women aged between 40 and 65. For the first fortnight, participants ate the same food. \nThen the participants were split in two groups, with one eating the high fibre diet, and the others eating low fibre. \nResearchers measured the weight, metabolic rate, blood glucose, calories excreted, hunger and fullness. \nThey found that hunger, fullness and diet satisfaction were no different between the different diets. \nEating a higher fibre diet with whole grains -- matching US dietary recommendations of 3oz (85g) of wholegrains for women and 4oz (113g) of wholegrains for men per day -- led to the loss of an extra 100 calories a day, or 700 calories over a week. Say no to polished white rice and embrace its brown variety. \nThis was caused by a higher resting metabolic rate and also lower absorption of calories in the digestive system, researchers said. \nDr Phil Karl, who led the study, said: ‘Many previous studies have suggested benefits of whole grains and dietary fibre on chronic disease risk. \n‘This study helps to quantify how whole grains and fibre work to benefit weight management, and lend credibility to previous reported associations between increased whole grains and fibre consumption, lower body weight and better health.’ \nDr Susan Roberts co-author said: ‘We provided all food to ensure that the composition of the diets differed only in grain source. \n‘The extra calories lost by those who ate whole grains was equivalent of a brisk 30 minutes walk or enjoying an extra small cookie every day in terms of its impact.’ \nIn the UK, the recommended amount of fibre to take in is 30 grams a day for an adult, although most people eat much less -- an average of around 12 grams. \nFollow @htlifeandstyle for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:54:59.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
