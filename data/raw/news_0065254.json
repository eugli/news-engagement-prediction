Yannick Bolasie will have his second knee operation in March. The Everton winger could be out until early 2018. #EFC - Ben Dinnery (@BenDinnery) February 23, 2017 \nThe surgery is set to take place at the beginning of next month and the tricky winger tweeted at the breaking of the news: See you soon :v:- Yannick Bolasie (@YannickBolasie) February 23, 2017 \nBolasie had already been unfortunate enough to miss the African Cup of Nations this year with Congo surprising Ivory Coast to go through to the knockout stages where they lost to Ghana. \nBolasie was still able to enjoy his country's performance though: \n(Credit: YouTube ) \nIt's such a shame for Bolasie and Everton and we wish him all the luck getting back on his feet and back on the pitch!
