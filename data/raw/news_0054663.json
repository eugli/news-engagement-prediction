The Cobham facility marks the start of a wider effort to support growth of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in north-west Europe. \n“We see more carmakers putting focus on hydrogen and the first vehicles are beginning to arrive in key markets, particularly Japan, Germany and California,” says Matthew Tipper, head of new fuels at Shell. “That gives us confidence to begin building out infrastructure.” \nHydrogen fuel cell vehicles have so far struggled to gain momentum in the race with battery-powered cars to become the dominant challenger to the internal combustion engine. The faltering progress was epitomised by Toyota’s recall last week of its entire global fleet of 2,800 Mirai hydrogen vehicles to fix a software glitch. Toyota's hydrogen-powered Mirai © AFP \nWith more than a million battery-powered or hybrid electric vehicles sold worldwide to date, compared with a few thousand hydrogen cars, sceptics question whether fuel cell technology already might have missed its moment. \nBut advocates of hydrogen cars are convinced of the technology’s long-term advantages. \nFuel cells work by fusing pressurised hydrogen with oxygen in a chemical reaction that generates electricity to power the car. Purified water is the only byproduct. \nWhereas current battery-powered cars take between 30 minutes and several hours to fully recharge, hydrogen vehicles can be refuelled as quickly as petrol or diesel-powered equivalents. They also have a longer range of up to 500km on a single tank — about twice the distance of the latest battery cars. \nAsian carmakers are spearheading development of hydrogen vehicles, with Toyota ’s Mirai first to market in 2014, followed by Hyundai ’s ix35 and Honda ’s Clarity. But sales have lagged behind battery vehicles such as the Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model S, in large part due to the lack of hydrogen filling stations. \nIn the UK, for example, there are more than 10,000 battery charging points compared with just a handful of private hydrogen stations for commercial fleets. \nThe greatest uptake so far has been in California, where Shell and Toyota this week won $16m of state funding to add a further seven filling stations to the 25 already open. Japan is planning a big push of the technology to coincide with the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo . One of Shell's hydrogen filling stations \nMr Tipper says Shell will work with carmakers and governments to ensure that Europe also plays its part in developing the market. \nCobham is close to the UK headquarters of Toyota and Honda, supporting the companies’ own fleets of hydrogen cars. Mr Tipper says the long-term aim is to gradually open “a string of sites from London to Manchester”.

He says there will be a role for both technologies, with batteries suited to smaller cars and short trips, and hydrogen for heavier vehicles and long distances. \nShell intends to serve both markets by installing battery charging points , as well as hydrogen pumps at some of its filling stations. \nCarmakers are also hedging their bets. General Motors last month expanded a partnership with Honda to invest $85m in hydrogen fuel cell manufacturing in Michigan, weeks after launching the US company’s Chevrolet Bolt battery car. \nBMW and Daimler are among other carmakers working on hydrogen technology. \nFor Shell, building a position in the hydrogen supply chain is part of wider efforts to prepare for a gradual shift beyond fossil fuels. The Anglo-Dutch group is also investing in offshore wind farms and solar power. \nThe sums committed so far are a tiny fraction of those invested in oil and gas, and the revenue even smaller, but Mr Tipper says Shell is gaining the expertise needed to step up spending once technologies mature. “We recognise that the energy transition is happening and Shell has to be prepared to change.” Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.
