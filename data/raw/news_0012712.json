Up 28-3 in the third quarter? There’s no way the Patriots will come back. It can’t happen. It won’t happen. \nIt DID happen. \nAnd then, to cope with more losing, people took to Twitter to make their best jokes comparing the Atlanta Falcons’ implosion to the shock many felt on election night. \nHere are some of our favorites: Atlanta has a 99.3% chance of winning, per ESPN.
