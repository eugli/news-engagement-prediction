While this gives Mohamud an advantage in the race, it is not enough to guarantee him victory.\nThe elections have been marred by widespread allegations of vote-buying and intimidation. \n\nIn a report on Tuesday, Somalia-based anti-corruption watchdog Marqaati said the elections \"were rife with corruption\".\nREAD MORE: Al-Shabab attack at Mogadishu hotel 'kills 28' \nWhile falling well short of the direct election that was promised, the process is more democratic than in the past and is seen as a step towards universal suffrage, now hoped for in 2020.\nWednesday's voting will see members of the 275-seat parliament and 54 senators cast ballots inside a hangar within the heavily-guarded airport. \n\nNo candidate is expected to get the two-thirds majority needed for a first-round win, with two further rounds permitted before a winner is declared.\nIn the absence of political parties, clan remains the organising principle of Somali politics.\nThe overthrow of president Siad Barre's military regime in 1991 ushered in decades of anarchy and conflict in a country deeply divided along clan lines.\nSomalia: Dozens killed in twin bomb attack on Mogadishu hotel \nThe clan rivalries and lawlessness provided fertile ground for al-Shabab to take hold and seize territory, frustrating efforts to set up a central administration.\nAl-Shabab has been in decline since 2011, but still launches regular, deadly attacks against government, military and civilian targets in the capital Mogadishu and elsewhere.\nSecurity and overcoming Somalia's adversarial and divisive politics will top the agenda for whoever wins the vote as will dealing with a growing humanitarian crisis.\nThe UN warned last week of \"possible famine\" in Somalia as a severe drought has pushed nearly 3 million people to the edge of starvation.\nAfter two failed rain seasons, aid workers fear a repeat of a 2010-11 drought which left more than 250,000 dead.\n\"The levels of suffering in the country, triggered by protracted conflict, seasonal shocks and disease outbreaks, are typically hard to bear, but the impact of this drought represents a threat of a different scale and magnitude,\" the UN's office for humanitarian affairs said in a statement last week.\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agencies \nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:44:35.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
