Two hand grenades, two automatic rifles and two pistols were recovered. \nPolice acted after getting information that the militants were planning to launch attacks on “vital installations” in the area. \nThe TTP faction claimed responsibility for a suicide bomb attack near the Punjab Assembly in Lahore on Monday that killed 15 people and wounded more than 80. \nThe Jamaatul Ahrar said the attack was the beginning of a new campaign of violence against the government, security forces, the judiciary and secular political parties. \nSince then, militants have killed two bomb-disposal officers in Quetta and a suicide bomber blew himself up outside a government office near Peshawar on Wednesday, killing five people. Also on Wednesday, a suicide bomber on a motor bike attacked a group of judges in a van in Peshawar, killing their driver. \nThe attacks have underlined the threat militants pose to the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif despite military operation Zarb-e-Azb launched in 2014 to push them out of their strongholds near the Afghan border. \nLahore put on terror alert \nThe Foreign Office said it had summoned Syed Abdul Nasir Yousafi, deputy head of mission at Afghanistan’s embassy in Islamabad, on Wednesday to voice concern about Jamaatul Ahrar “sanctuaries” in Afghanistan. \nThe government says militants launch attacks from the Afghan side of the border. “Afghanistan was urged to take urgent measures to eliminate the terrorists and their sanctuaries, financiers and handlers,” the FO said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:04:45.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
