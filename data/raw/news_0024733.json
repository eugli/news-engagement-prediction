Hold on. Isn't it called the Union Flag when not flying at sea? Do you know anything about your country's colours at at all? \nA majority of Brits (55 per cent) aren't able to tell which way up they should display their nation's emblem, according to new YouGov research. \nParticipants were shown two images of the Union Jack. One was flown upside-down, the other the right way up. And only 45 per cent could tell which was flying correctly. A third were wrong in their statements, while 22 per cent said they simply didn't know. Is this correct? Can you tell?

Here This is the wrong way up (Photo: Getty) \nNow sure, you might suggest this isn't all that important. But in an age of patriotism and political upheaval, it's topical. Although less than half are able to determine which way to fly our country's colours, a majority (56 per cent), believe government buildings should be required to fly them. \nYouGov adds: \"Despite their [Brits] inability to tell which way up the flag should go, the majority of people (55 per cent) like the design of the UK’s flag. \n\"Only 6 per cent actively dislike it (rising to 11 per cent in Wales and 18 per cent in Scotland), while a further 33 per cent neither like nor dislike the flag.\" This is flying properly Right way up (Photo: Getty) \nThe reasons for higher levels of discontent in Wales is due to the lack of any semblance of Welsh identity. We've got no dragon there at all. Interestingly, most Brits (55 per cent), would be happy to accommodate some Welsh in the Union Jack. \n\"The same proportion (55 per cent) of Brits would back removing Scotland from the flag in the event of Scottish independence , although 24 per cent of people would want to keep the flag design as it is.\" Union Jack?

President was on a date with another woman at the time \nYou might have noticed we've called our flag the Union Jack throughout this article. And you might be aware of some of the myths that encircle the naming – around 49 per cent think the Union Jack is the flag's only name, while a significant proportion (about a quarter) believe the difference between land and sea. \nBut both are correct. A publication, Flying Flags in the United Kingdom , produced by Parliament’s Flags & Heraldry Committee in conjunction with the Flag Institute, denotes both names are allowed. Just 16 per cent of Brits knew this, when quizzed. Read More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:28:23.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
