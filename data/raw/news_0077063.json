And on Monday night, Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel took to his show to give his take on what happened when Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway mistakenly presented La La Land with this year's Best Picture before the actual winner, Moonlight , was handed the accolade. \"What Warren did is he was confused so he handed it to Faye and let her read the winner,\" he explained. \"In other words, Clyde threw Bonnie under the bus. It was a slick move.\" \nThe duo, famed for playing the titular roles in hit crime movie Bonnie and Clyde , had been handed the wrong envelope which set off mass confusion amongst the A-list crowd. Jimmy went on to talk about the commotion which had been going behind the La La Land team - producers Jordan Horowitz , Marc Platt and Fred Berger , who were giving speeches on the stage. \"The host will go on stage and clear this up, then I remember, I'm the host,\" he said of his thought process. Here’s the INSIDE story of what happened at the craziest #Oscars ever last night… @TheAcademy @ABCNetwork pic.twitter.com/w6xgsoaXSM \nOscars 2017: The complete winners list \n\"My first instinct was to tell Horowitz to run,\" he added. \"I'm probably supposed to do something because no one's doing anything, and then Warren Beatty steps up to explain.\" The presenter continued: \"So Moonlight was the best picture, and who the hell even knows who was who from each movie.\" Jimmy also revealed he was grateful that Oscar nominee Denzel Washington was on hand to help save the day. He explained how the actor signalled to him to get Barry Jenkins, the director of Moonlight, to make his way to the stage. \"Thank god Denzel was there to talk sense,\" he remarked.

Here's how! \nJimmy also joked about Faye's quick disappearance - much like her bank-robbing character. \"Faye Dunaway made quite the getaway,\" he quipped. \"She got the hell out of there. She read the wrong name and she split. She wanted no part of it.\" It was widely expected that La La Land would win the coveted award. The movie managed to win six awards in total, including Best Actress for Emma Stone , and Best Director for Damien Chazelle . Moonlight , meanwhile, took home three awards; Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor for Mahershala Ali and Best Adapted Screenplay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:58:43.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
