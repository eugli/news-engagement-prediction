He's On The Runway At New York Fashion Week Oh, and he was shirtless backstage. 02/14/2017 10:58 am ET Jamie Feldman Fashion & Lifestyle   \nIt‚Äôs been two and a half years since ‚Äúhot convict‚Äù Jeremy Meeks first looked straight into our souls with those piercing blue eyes, and one year since he was released from a California prison to begin pursuing his destiny: modeling. \nNow, he‚Äôs ‚Äï where else? ‚Äï at New York Fashion Week. Meeks walked the runway at the Phillip Plein show Monday, looking as handsome as he did in his famous mugshot . Peter White via Getty Images Albert Urso via Getty Images \nThe 33-year-old, who served time for a felony weapons conviction, previously told ABC News he never ‚Äúthought that everyone in the world would recognize me for my looks.‚Äù \nHe signed with a management agency in 2016, and then shared many a shirtless photo on Instagram. Now, though, he‚Äôs rubbing elbows with former French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld and opening one of the most hotly anticipated runway shows of the week. This is the real deal, people. \nBoth attendees and far-off onlookers were quick to share the news on social media.
