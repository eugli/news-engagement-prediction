Missouri lawmakers train sights on trial lawyers By Kurt Erickson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Atchison Daily Globe | 0 comments \nJEFFERSON CITY • Buoyed by Gov. Eric Greitens’ calls to revamp the state’s legal system, Republicans who control the Legislature are marching forward with plans they say will rein in trial lawyers and improve the state’s job climate. \nLess than three weeks after the political newcomer called the state’s court system “broken” during his first State of the State speech, the House and the Senate approved proposals that could limit lawsuit awards, as well as a measure that would alter rules regarding expert testimony in trials. \nThe action comes as the GOP supermajorities in the Legislature are working to overcome eight years of opposition to the changes from former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, as well as a stern warning from Missouri’s top judge that there are other pressing issues within the legal system that need attention. \nRepublicans and Greitens contend their moves, backed by business lobby groups like the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, will help the economy by limiting liability lawsuits against businesses. \nSen. Ed Emery, R-Lamar, said legislation he is sponsoring will “bring judgments back in line with reality.” \nOpponents say the changes will hurt people who are injured by limiting their ability collect adequate damages. \nUnder House Bill 153, state courts would be required to follow a standard used in federal courts when it comes to allowing expert witnesses. Rep. Kevin Corlew, R-Kansas City, said the lack of a standard hurts business growth because companies potentially face higher legal costs in Missouri. \nIn vetoing a similar measure last year, Nixon said the change would clog the court system and put an unfair burden on trial judges who make the determinations, forcing them to “conduct unnecessary hearings and become quasi-experts on complex subjects.” \nThe measure won approval on a 106-50 vote Thursday and now goes to the Senate for further debate. \nSenate Bill 31 would place limits on amounts paid for medical care to the amount actually paid, not what is billed. Projected future costs of care cannot be included. \nEmery said the legislation will help companies reduce costs and potentially result in them creating more jobs. \n“It will impact insurance rates,” Emery said. \nSen. Scott Sifton, D-Affton, was among the opponents. He said Missourians who are seriously injured in accidents would be limited in getting long-term care. \nThe proposed changes under consideration may be just the beginning of Greitens’ attempts to change the legal landscape in Missouri. \nTwo proposals have been filed that would make changes to the current system, which was put in place more than 70 years ago in the aftermath of political scandals in Kansas City and St. Louis. \n​ Kurt Erickson • 573-556-6181 \n@KurtEricksonPD on Twitter kerickson@post-dispatch.com Discuss Print", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:46:03.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
