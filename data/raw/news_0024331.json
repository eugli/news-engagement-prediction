Maybe you only have a limited amount of time to devote to college basketball. \nThen perhaps you should consider becoming a VCU fan, because the Rams seem to save their best for the last 0.4 seconds, at least in every game they've played over the last week. \nEarlier this week, the Rams trailed with 0.4 seconds to play at St. Bonaventure. Yet a premature court storm from St. Bonaventure earned VCU a technical foul that sent the Rams to the line, and VCU pulled it out in overtime. \nWednesday's result, as crazy as the win over St. Bonaventure was, may top that. \nWith time expiring, George Washington 's Yuta Watanabe drilled a go-ahead 3-pointer for what appeared to be the winner. \nAfter review of the play, officials put 0.4 seconds on the clock. It forced VCU into a Hail Mary situation, down one point and taking the inbound on the opposite end of the floor. \nYet VCU's prayers were answered just moments later in the most unlikely ways: by drawing a charge (yes, a charge) that sent JeQuan Lewis to the free throw line. This foul sent @VCU_Hoops to the line with 0.4 to go, where JeQuan Lewis connected on both for the win. https://t.co/J7DvFOypmo — CBS Sports Network (@CBSSportsNet) February 9, 2017 \nFor GW, that is as disheartening a way to lose as any. Not only does that call (a charging foul against a player not on offense) rarely happen, but it happened at the worst possible time. \nAnd VCU fans rejoiced once more. \nSummed in a tweet, Gary Parrish explained it perfectly: So here's the deal: VCU has now won two straight games despite falling behind with 0.4 left on the clock in both. That's hard to do. https://t.co/QQi35L5ioK — Gary Parrish (@GaryParrishCBS) February 9, 2017 Add a comment", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T11:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:35:10.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
