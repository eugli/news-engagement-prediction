He will appear in the Modimolle Magistrate's Court today [Monday],\" said Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo. \nThe man and a woman told police on Saturday night that they mistook the farmworker for an animal while they were out warthog hunting on Meisiesvlei farm near Tuinplaas. \nAccording to police, they heard a noise in the bush and shot in its direction. \nThe farmworker was shot in the back and died. \nHe worked on a neighbouring farm. \nPolice have not released his name because they are trying to trace his family to break the news to them. \nThe couple was allowed to return to Pretoria after reporting it to police. \nThe provincial police commissioner was given the case docket and the initial proposed charge of culpable homicide was changed to murder. \nMojapelo said the police were ready for any outpouring of outrage in the community over the shooting.
