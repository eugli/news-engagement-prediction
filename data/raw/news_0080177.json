The Republican nonetheless added that he \"wants\" a two-party system.\nMr Trump's comments slightly undermine efforts by the White House to present his address to Congress on Tuesday night as an opportunity to reset his relationship with lawmakers.\nThe address, which Trump has been writing with aide Stephen Miller and others, will include some gestures toward unifying a polarised country as he tries to bind the wounds from a bitterly fought election, aides have told reporters.\nMr Trump's speech is not being labeled a State of the Union address because he has had so little time in office so far.\nDemocratic lawmakers plan to attend the speech and give their reactions to reporters afterward, as is the custom during similar events, according to congressional aides.\nAnd Ms Pelosi, in remarks to reporters on Monday, said that if Mr Trump's address was anything like his inaugural speech, in which he referred to \"American carnage\" and painted a dark picture of the US, \"Âœit will be a very sad evening for our country\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:10:26.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
