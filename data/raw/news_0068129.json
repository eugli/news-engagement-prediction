Liverpool's task against Leicester City on Monday night has perhaps been made more difficult by the champions' -shock decision on Thursday to part company with manager Claudio Ranieri.\nWhen the sides met earlier in the season at Anfield, Liverpool made short work of the defending Champs with a 4-1 victory that was even more comprehensive than the scoreline suggested. The Reds were rampant that day, marking the opening of the new Main Stand in style as goals from Adam Lallana, Sadio Man√© and a brace from Roberto Firmino ensured Lucas Leiva's gift to Jamie Vardy proved to be little more than scant consolation.\nIt looked like a real statement victory from Liverpool at the time, but few realised at the time just how poor Leicester had suddenly become. What originally felt like a thumping win over the title winners was actually just another routine three points collected against relegation fodder. Leicester's dramatic fall from grace means the shine has certainly been taken off that win somewhat but the Reds would surely settle for any kind of victory on Monday night given this week's developments.\nLeicester City Liverpool 8:00 PM UTC Game Details Home: 9/2 Draw: 16/5 Away: 13/20 Odds from bet365 bet365 PickCenter GameCast Lineups and Stats\nRanieri has since paid the price for Leicester's dreadful campaign but his dismissal has not been met with universal approval. The wider football world are generally appalled by it but given the dire situation in which Leicester find themselves, the board clearly believed they had to take action because there was nothing in their recent performances to suggest they would rally and stave off the threat of the drop. Liverpool supporters would have preferred the Foxes' board to have waited until after Monday night's game, because it's invariably trickier facing a team that has just sacked a manager.\nLeicester's players have been widely criticised for forcing the popular Italian out, so they will presumably be keen to put on a performance. Reports suggest that many senior players were not happy with some of Ranieri's tactical decisions and team selections but with the Italian now ousted, there's nobody left for Leicester's under-performing players to blame.\nQuite simply, they have to start delivering now and Liverpool therefore have to expect Leicester's players will be as motivated for this game as they have been at any point all season.\nIt will also be interesting to see how the home crowd react. Often when a manager is sacked it's due to fan pressure, but this one appears to be almost completely due to player power and there was no great fan unrest or campaign to get Ranieri out. Ranieri will always be loved by Leicester supporters and there are some parallels to be drawn with what happened at Chelsea last season, not just because they too were defending champions. When Jose Mourinho was sacked many Chelsea supporters blamed the players, and some were booed the next time they played at Stamford Bridge. Could that happen on Monday?\nAlexis Nunes and Paul Mariner predict the Premier League fixtures in week 26.\nOne major difference is that unlike Chelsea, Leicester are in a relegation dogfight and need the support of their fans more than ever. They'll be hoping the atmosphere on Monday night will be electric, but there's every chance it could be flat. If Liverpool can get on top early, the crowd might turn against the team.\nThese are things Jurgen Klopp should be telling his players. A fast start is always important anyway, particularly for a team with Liverpool's all-action style of play. But if they can fly out of the traps on Monday and score an early goal or two, Leicester might wave the white flag.\nRegardless of whether Ranieri was the problem or not, Leicester's players have to be low on confidence and Liverpool must use that to their advantage. Of course Liverpool's players have questions of their own they must answer, not least whether they have what it takes to perform as well against struggling teams as they do against those at the top of the table. Monday night will be a good test of that.\nThe Reds appear to be over their own mini-crisis, having ended their run of poor form and results with a comprehensive win over Tottenham two weeks ago before jetting off to La Manga for some warm weather training. Elimination from the FA Cup at the hands of Championship strugglers Wolves was a blow to Klopp and his team, but it might yet prove to be a blessing in disguise if this break has allowed the team to regroup and recharge their batteries ahead of the run-in.\nKlopp has most of his best XI fit and available and he has often spoke of the importance of having time to work with his players on the training ground. By the time his team take to the field against Leicester, it will have been 15 days since their last game. This mini \"winter break\" could be just what Liverpool needed but their performance on Monday night will go a long way towards determining that.\nDave Usher is one of ESPN's Liverpool bloggers and the founder of LFC fanzine and website The Liverpool Way.
