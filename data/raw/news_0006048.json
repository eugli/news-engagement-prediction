midfielder Philip Billing as Sam Allardyce continues to scour the market for players he hopes can keep his new club in the Premier League.\nBilling is a Denmark Under 21 international and at 6ft 5ins is a powerhouse unit of a defensive midfielder.\nThe 20-year-old joined Huddersfield's youth system from his native Esbjerg in 2013 and broke through into the first team only a year later at 18.\nCrystal Palace have made an enquiry to Huddersfield about midfielder Philip Billing (right)\nOne deal in jeopardy is Carl Jenkinson, as the Arsenal defender wants nearly £70,000-a-week\nHe doesn't score often but is known for a couple of screamers, against Nottingham Forest and Cardiff City last year.\nOne Palace deal in jeopardy is Carl Jenkinson, though, as the Arsenal defender wants nearly £70,000-a-week to sign for Palace.\nThe bar has been set by the fact Palace are paying another January signing, Jeff Schlupp, nearly £60,000-a-week.\nJenkinson earns £40,000-a-week at Arsenal, who will have to consider paying at least some of the difference if they want to move him out, meaning the transfer is currently not set to happen.\nLiverpool defender Mamadou Sakho's agent is in London talking to Crystal Palace\nWith Jenkinson's move on the rocks, Allardyce has turned his attentions to other defensive options.\nLiverpool defender Mamadou Sakho's agent is in London talking to Palace, with Southampton waiting in the wings.\nLiverpool may have to back down on their desire for a permanent deal and take a loan fee with suitors paying his wages in full.\nCrystal Palace are also looking at 29-year-old Uruguayan free agent Martin Caceres\nAnother man expected at Palace today is free agent Martin Caceres, the 29-year-old centre back who left Juventus last summer.\nHis unattached status means he does not have to sign before tonight’s deadline. Nonetheless, Palace want a quick conclusion to this deal.\nPalace are also trying to hijack Southampton's deal for Spartak Moscow defender Serdar Tasci. The 29-year-old German was due to sign for Southampton on loan today but Palace have come in with an offer to take him on a permanent transfer.\nJordon Mutch is due at Reading for a medical ahead of loan move away from south London\nPalace do however look set to miss out on defender Kara Mbodji with Anderlecht reluctant to sell. They have had an offer approaching the £10m-mark rejected for the Senegal international ahead of the transfer deadline.\nMbodji is a regular for Anderlecht and the Belgian club are reluctant to lose him as they chase Bruges at the top of their domestic league. A significant price hike could prove tempting but a move looks unlikely.\nAnother man unlikely to be at Selhurst Park tomorrow however is midfielder Jordon Mutch. He is due at Reading for a medical ahead of loan move away from south London.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMailArsenal"], "published": "2017-01-31T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:43:00.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
