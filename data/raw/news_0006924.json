Not because Nancy Pelosi said so , but because of things he himself has said about his beliefs. Pelosi just stated the obvious and she wasn’t the first Democrat to do so, as Al Franken also pointed to Bannon’s white supremacist rantings back in November. So did Harry Reid . She stated what the mainstream media should have been stating all along. \nWhile the mainstream media shies away from hard truths, Nancy Pelosi did not. Fox News , however, was horrified, leading Fox News’ The Five co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle to speak of “desperate” liberals “disparagings” someone without proof. And it isn’t just Fox. CBS News’ Scott Pelley said that CBS Evening News could not find “any quotes from Bannon himself advocating white supremacy.” \nClearly, this is true only because they did not want to find such quotes. There is a reason people like Nazi Richard Spencer and the KKK’s David Duke love Steve Bannon. \nWe’re talking about the guy who said of Muslim immigrants last April that “These are not Jeffersonian democrats. These are not people with thousands of years of democracy in their DNA coming up here.” A man who claims the Western world is engaged in “ global existential war .” This is a war, to use a term in vogue at the time of Jefferson, the by definition “Anglo-Saxon” race against Islam. \nWatch courtesy of Media Matters: \nBOB BECKEL : Kimberly, I suppose using the word “white supremacist” without having proof beyond the fact, that in the web page, there were some white supremacists who wrote some things, but I don’t like Bannon. I don’t like any of them. That is not the point. KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE : He is not a white supremacist and she shouldn’t slander him by saying this. It’s really conduct unbecoming. She has no proof to back that up. It shows the depths that they will go to try to disparage someone and the desperation, really, of the liberals. And I’m so sorry, Bob, but, your party right now. \nOf course, Bannon himself has said that Breitbart is “the platform of the alt-right,” where Hitler salutes abound. Former Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro says something also equally obvious about the alt-right from its content, that it is a “movement shot through with racism and anti-Semitism.” \nIn an article at The Daily Wire, Shapiro pointed to “[Milo] Yiannopoulos pushing white ethno-nationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness, and the comment section turning into a cesspool for white supremacist mememakers.” \nAl Franken pointed out that, \n“Bannon published an article two weeks after the shooting in Charleston, where nine African-Americans were massacred, titled ‘Hoist it High and Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims a Glorious Heritage.’” \nThe Confederate flag, the flag Bannon is so proud of, does, according to actual Confederates at the time of the secession, stand for white supremacy: \nAnd Bannon is not just anti-Muslim. He is anti-Semitic as well, having called Jews “enablers” of Jihad. Steve Bannon’s Breitbart was, as Joy Reid says , a “racist right wing blog.” \nHow do you not call Steve Bannon a white supremacist? Yet the Daily Mail called Pelosi’s words “astonishing.” \nThese are facts that cannot be denied. Bannon is damned by his own words and it is blatantly dishonest for Fox News now to pretend Bannon is being unfairly accused by “desperate” Democrats. \nWe live in terrible times indeed if speaking the truth is now held to be “astonishing” or “desperate.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T16:44:48.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
