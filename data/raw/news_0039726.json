The McCanns are considering legal action after the show appeared on YouTube (Photo: Collect Unknown) \nAccording to the Daily Star, the McCanns have enlisted the help of specialist libel firm Carter Ruck. \nThe couple's spokesman told the Star: \"Any potentially defamatory material found online will be reviewed and assessed by Kate and Gerry’s lawyers.\" \nAmaral is currently believed to be in Switzerland putting the finishing touches to a sequel to his first book about the case. \nBut earlier this month, the McCanns warned they will sue if the book is sold in the UK. Goncalo Amaral (Photo: Mirrorpix) \nFamily spokesman Clarence Mitchell said: \"If Mr Amaral's current book about Madeleine or any new one he may be planning to write is published here in the UK Kate and Gerry's lawyers will take immediate action. \n\"He needs to know lawyers are watching.\" \nAmaral was ordered to pay them €500,000 in 2015, but successfully appealed before the McCanns lost their counter-appeal at Portugal’s Supreme Court in January. \nJudges found Amaral’s “right to freedom of ­expression” was worthy of greater protection than the McCanns’ “right to honour”. \nFormer GP Kate and cardiologist Gerry may keep fighting the case in the European courts.
