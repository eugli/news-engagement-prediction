Kevin Durant (left), Russell Westbrook (right) (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:20 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:20 p.m. ET \nThey won't find each other's names in their missed call logÂ anytime soon, but Kevin Durant and Russell WestbrookÂ still know how to dial each other up when needed.Â \nIn the biggest free agency departure since LeBron James left the Cavaliers for Miami in 2010, Durant chucked the deuces to theÂ Thunder to join the Warriors this past offseason after falling to them in the Western Conference finals, leaving Westbrook to fend for himself without another superstar with whom to go to battle.Â \nChronicling of the state of their relationship reached tabloid levels this past summer,Â and became an outright soap opera as Durant returned to Oklahoma City for a regular-season meeting against his former team Feb. 11, a matchup that produced a shouting match between the two at halfcourt.Â \nPrior to Sunday's NBA All-Star Game at Smoothie King Center in New Orleans, mediaÂ speculation about how theÂ two would manage to deal with each other on and off the court annoyed Westbrook so much he refused to entertain any questions about his former teammate, instead opting to offer his opinions on fashion. \nMORE: Ranking every 2017 NBA All-Star \nWho knows if they'll ever be friends again, but one thing's for certain:Â They haven't forgotten how to play together. Durant threw a sick lob to Westbrook early in the first quarter and Mr. Triple-Double threw it down with ease just like old times.Â The mystery is over ... Durant to Westbrook... good #NBAAllStar pic.twitter.com/BVMOHnlGpi â Jabari Young (@JabariJYoung) February 20, 2017 \nYou can't erase eight yearsÂ of history in a little more than six months. It's safe to say we won't be seeing either of them freeze the other one out on the court like Isiah Thomas did Michael Jordan back in the day. \nCheck out the West All-Stars' reaction. #TeamWest 's reaction to Russ & KD đ pic.twitter.com/z23l1Yjg29 â NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) February 20, 2017 Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:35:26.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
