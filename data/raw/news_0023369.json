Academics reveal the real Mr Darcy. https://t.co/mbbKnxZdPl â€” Drama Channel (@drama_channel) February 9, 2017 \nThe result? Well, herewith some out takes from their description of his physical appearance: Advertisement \n\"Loose, powdered mid-length hair,\" \n\"Smooth, unmarked skin ... Odds-on he was as pale as marble, with something of the classical statue,\" \n\"The square-jawed hero is virtually unknown at this period,\" \n\"The six pack was unknown and square-shouldered bulk was the mark of the navvy not the gentlemen. Chests were modest and shoulders sloping ... The general effect was one of languid, graceful length not breadth. More ballet dancer than beef-cake.\" \nOf course, even when talking about Jane Austen, attractiveness is always going to be a case of different strokes for different folks. One person's weak chin is another's erogenous 'thing' and all, and we can't all look like Colin Firth (gosh, even poor Colin Firth wasn't thought to have been handsome enough to play the role of Darcy). \nAs Charles Darwin once wrote, \"It is certainly not true that there is in the mind of man any universal standards of beauty with respect to the human body.\" \nThing is though, we may all be held hostage to impossible beauty standards (e.g. in Austen's time a tan was terribly declasse) and research suggests that there are generally universal agreements on what makes someone attractive (it's all about facial symmetry, see ). \nSo there's little point in fretting too much about the gap between fantasy and reality - think of it as the romantic novel version of a Tinder date who was perhaps a little creative with how he sold himself in his profile. And let's cut this rendering of a fictional figure some slack, like all of us, he's just doing the best with what he's got. \nThat said, to help soften the blow, remember, we always have this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T09:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:59:21.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
