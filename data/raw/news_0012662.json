Mr Hammond faces a \"more than one-in-three chance\" of missing his target of keeping the structural deficit below 2 per cent of national income in 2020/21, despite it being a \"much easier\" goal than those set by Mr Osborne. \nThe IFS found efforts to reduce spending on disability and incapacity benefits have delivered \"much lower\" savings than ministers hoped. Spending on incapacity benefits was £15 billion in 2015/16 - 45% higher than forecast.
