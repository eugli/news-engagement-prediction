Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017\nMinutes later, Trump fired off another tweet, saying as president he calls his \"own shots.\"\nI call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017\nOn Friday, a CNN/ORC poll found most Americans opposed the travel restrictions that were put in place by Trump's temporary immigration restrictions on refugees.\nA U.S. appeals court late Saturday denied a request from the Justice Department to immediately restore Trump's order barring citizens from seven mainly Muslim countries and temporarily banning refugees.\nTrump denounced the \"so-called\" judge in a series of tweets on Saturday.\nOn Sunday, The New York Times — one of Trump's biggest targets — published a story detailing the first two weeks of Trump's administration, including Trump signing an order giving chief strategist Steve Bannon a spot on the National Security Council. The report said Trump was not fully briefed on the details of the order.\n© Provided by CNBC\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/828574430800539648", "http://cnbc.com/", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmFoVo%3focid%3dst&text=Trump+to+news+media%3a+%27I+call+my+own+shots%27&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmFoVo%3focid%3dst", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmFoVo?blobrefkey=101&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;184&quot;}", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmFoVo?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;102&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmFoVo?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;468&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;272&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/us/politics/trump-white-house-aides-strategy.html?_r=1", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmFoVo?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/828575949268606977", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA2oHEB.img", "http://vapi.cnbc.com/videoservice/rssvideosearch.do?partnerId=8020&quot;}", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/865a198f-8b80-44c5-8835-d93d1f0de1bf/2bcf3e9b-7ac6-4ef3-8650-7220aa330b49.ism&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1006&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/865a198f-8b80-44c5-8835-d93d1f0de1bf/2bcf3e9b-7ac6-4ef3-8650-7220aa330b49.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;htt", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/02/03/rel2a.-.trump.pdf", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmFoVo%3focid%3dsl&title=Trump+to+news+media%3a+%27I+call+my+own+shots%27&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmFoVo%3focid%3dsl", "http://www.cnbc.com/stephen-bannon/?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=104263624|Trump", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA9UODq.img", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmFoVo&lang=en-us&flow_id=7b14109c-3499-485f-80c5-426f29689c09", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmFeFs.img&quot;}}", "http://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=104263624|Trump", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBnMzWD.img"], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:47:01.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
