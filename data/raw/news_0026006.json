I noticed her eyes were rolling around and I thought I would not give her any more medicine. \n\"There was then a knock at the door and it was the pharmacist. He said that there had been a mix up and ‘have we got the medicine he gave to Ruby this morning?’ \n“He said she will be fine, but wanted a private meeting at the pharmacy the next day.” \nMiss Buckley and her partner Ralph Bell, 38, said their daughter felt “really warm”. They were so concerned about her state that they returned to the pharmacy. The youngster was accidentally prescribed Methadone (Photo: Daily Record) \nThey were then taken home and told Ruby-Mai had been given methadone. Miss Buckley said: “I was hysterical. The state I was in was unreal. I thought I was going to lose my daughter when I heard that word – methadone. \n“The only reason I did not give her any more was because she was so sleepy. It is still in my head about what if we gave her more. We would have lost her.” \nMr Bell added: “What happened was awful. It was not until he came back a second time that we knew. As soon as I knew what had happened I rushed up the stairs, got her in the car and got her to hospital.” \nRuby-Mai who is at primary school, said: “I am scared to take medicine now because I took the wrong medicine and it made me really poorly. \n\"Mum said that grandma came on the day but I can’t remember anything. I am back at school today and I am enjoying it.” \nThe pharmacy has now written to the couple explaining the mix-up and NHS England has launched a full investigation. \nNottinghamshire Police is also investigating this incident and told the Post that it had received a report of an incident involving a nine-year-old girl allegedly being prescribed methadone by mistake, instead of antibiotics. \nA police spokeswoman for the police said: “The girl was taken to the Queen’s Medical Centre after ingesting the drug but has since been discharged. \n\"Enquiries are ongoing and Nottinghamshire Police is liaising with other agencies under local authority child protection procedures.” \nOliver Newbould, locality director for NHS England - North Midlands, said: “NHS England has been made aware of a potential drug dispensing error at the pharmacy. Such incidents are very rare and a full investigation is underway by the pharmacy.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:40:31.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
