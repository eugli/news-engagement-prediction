Hackers approached Doyen Sports in Portugal, part of Mr Oliveira's firm Doyen Global, according to the Daily Mirror . \nMr Beckham's team refused to cooperate with the blackmailers and called the police early last year, the newspaper reported. \nA source said: \"They approached by email and attempted to meet via another third party. \n\"The investigation has been going on behind the scenes for some time and involved several prominent companies.\" David Beckham with daughter Harper \nT he blackmailer, going by the fake name Artem Lovuzov, told Doyen Sports chief executive Neilo Lucas: \"A generous donation, and you can be sure that all the information I possess will be destroyed.\" \nWhen there was no response, the blackmailer wrote: \"I'm giving you until 16.00 on Tuesday to contact my lawyer with a view to a proper resolution to this impasse.\" \nThe hackers are understood to have targeted a number of businesses connected to the football world. \nIt emerged as Katherine Jenkins hit back at Beckham over his criticism of her in the leaked emails. \nMs Jenkins reeled off a list of her charity achievements in response. Professor Jonathan Shalit, her manager, told the Sun: \"Katherine was awarded an OBE for her services to music and charity. \n\"She has performed for Presidents and Royalty including at Westminster Cathedral in honour of Pope John Paul II's Silver Jubilee and Her Majesty the Queen's 00th birthday celebrations.\" \nMr Beckham broke his social media silence over the weekend to pay tribute to Man United's Busby Babes who were killed in the 1958 Munich air crash.
