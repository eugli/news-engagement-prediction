The German title, as well as the French, confirmed it!

Many fans had wondered whether, if the “Jedi” in the title were singular, that Luke would have to die in order to leave Rey as the titular “Last Jedi.” Really, all this means is that Luke won’t be the last Jedi. Jedi in the plural form. Interesting... — Jezreel C. Castillo (@dezastron) February 17, 2017 @b_hawk I've always wondered, if \"jedi\" is plural, shouldn't the singular be \"jedus\"? — T.S. Wingard (@Physiololgus) February 17, 2017 @Physiololgus That's only assuming \"Jedi\" is Latin; & I assume it's not. It is used in both singular & plural in the original trilogy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T21:03:37.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
