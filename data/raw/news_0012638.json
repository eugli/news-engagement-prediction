Like Helena Christensen and Ellen von Unwerth before her, Jenner is the latest beauty to channel her fashion expertise into photography. For her newest outing, Jenner shot the covers of the British glossy Love magazine out today. Set in the California desert, Jenner’s dreamy portraits were inspired by the ease and offbeat cool of ’90s editorial images. Her portfolio (almost all styled by Panos Yiapanis with creative direction from Katie Grand) offers a naturalistic take on familiar faces like Kaia Gerber, Hari Nef, and Sienna Miller. The shoot showcases vintage fashion alongside new pieces from Burberry and Vetements. Loading View on Instagram While the Love covers are one of her first professional outings as a photographer, Jenner has been making waves with her images for some time now. From creating 2015’s most-liked Instagram to occasionally taking snapshots of friends for their social media accounts, Jenner has always shown an interest in image-making, particularly online. Her skill with the Internet proved especially helpful with the second portion of the project: finding the next generation of Insta girls. Several of Jenner’s subjects were discovered via a hashtag-based contest that focused on personality as well as beauty. The winners include an artist (Belle Smith), a plucky Arizona teen (Mia Autumn Grace), and a blogger and environmental activist (Joyjah Estrada), each of whom has a sizable social media following and the kind of distinctive good looks that translate into great photographs. Loading View on Instagram Though it’s unlikely that Jenner will permanently trade in her heels for a Leica, her foray into photography adds a new layer to her career, which has been convention-defying from the start. It also sends a powerful message in an industry where the majority of fashion images are still created by men. Jenner’s shift may not only inspire her fellow runway stars to express themselves creatively, it also shows the millions of little girls who follow her every move that they can do a whole lot more than pose.
