A source explains, “Anushka is playing the role of a friendly spirit in the movie. To take this thought forward, she has got a personal phone number registered in the name of Shashi – the character from the film that she is playing. She will interact with fans through WhatsApp’s video calling feature. All they have to do is add the number on WhatsApp. The number will be constantly used by her throughout the campaign of Phillauri to engage with her fans, who will get exclusive access to the film’s promotional content too.” \nTalking about the innovation, Shikha Kapur, chief marketing officer, Fox Star Studios, says, “The unique storyline of Phillauri, where the lead-actor plays a friendly spirit who cannot be seen by people, gives us the opportunity to create a campaign that is imaginative. For Phillauri, we have created ideas that are experiential in nature and invoke participation. WhatsApp with Shashi, is one such idea where we tap into the reach of the chatting platform in the country, which has 160 million monthly users.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:15:09.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
