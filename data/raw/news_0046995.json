By Emily McCombs \nBaby powder. Flour. Glitter. Vaseline. Hersheyâ€™s Syrup. You may not realize it but these are all dangerous, dangerous substances when paired with a mischievous child. \nWe asked the HuffPost Parents community to share their most epic kid messes â€• the ones that took them hours to sweep, vacuum, mop and/or scrub up. \nKeep scrolling to find out which substances to keep out of reach next time you dare to take that shower or nap. 1 Kids. Vs. Beanbag \"They opened the foam-filled beanbag. Still vacuuming a year later.\" 2 Kid Vs. Flour Sarah Pineda \"My daughter Camila and one of her biggest messes! Flour is now banned from our house.\" 3 Baby Vs. Food Coloring Sam Navarro \"His sister colored him so pretty with baker's food coloring. It took wayyyy too long to fade away!\" 4 3-Year-Olds Vs. Red Lipstick Kelly Mulder \"My friend and I caught our 3 year-olds red handed -- literally! We all learned that long-lasting lipstick is a bear to get out. Only Dawn dish soap worked to get most of it out.\" 5 Twins Vs. Baby Powder Kathryn Moore Sanford \"My twins emptied an ENTIRE bottle of baby powder all over each other and their room....it took days to clean it all up!\" 6 Kid Vs. Baby Powder, Part II Kasey LIttler \"My son decided it needed to 'snow' inside. House smelled of baby powder for weeks.\" 7 Kid Vs. The Wall Katie Cline Weinberger \"Basically EVERY other wall on this floor is chalkboard paint except for this one ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜‚\" 8 Kid Vs. Diaper Cream Kelli Walsh \"His sister colored him so pretty with baker's food coloring. It took wayyyy too long to fade away!\" 9 Kid Vs. Red Marker Becky Walters Anderson \"Marker. Even though it was washable, it still took a few times to wash it completely off. ðŸ˜•\" 10 Twins vs. Aquaphor Kelly Bossley \"The kids got into the Aquaphor while we were at a holiday party and a sitter was 'watching' them. They smeared a full giant tub on nearly every surface of their room (including linens and clothes from the dresser) and of course all over themselves. While it took hours to fully clean the walls, furniture, linens and clothing, it literally took days to de-grease their hair. In the end, it took more washes than I care to remember with pretty much every substance known to modern man before their hair was blonde again and no longer stiff. Needless to say, we have never used that babysitter again and I am grateful that their 3rd birthday pictures were taken before they decided to party with the Aquaphor.\" 11 Kid Vs. Hershey's Syrup Dottie Frye Jones \"An entire bottle of Hershey's syrup all over his room. Somehow he got it on the ceiling as well.\" 12 Kid Vs. Craft Supplies Sarah Holmes \"I popped to the loo and in the 30 seconds I was gone, my 3-year-old emptied numerous bags of craft supplies all over the floor and proceeded to roll around in it. Worst thing was that the vacuum wouldn't pick any of it up (the sequins and tiny bits of shiny paper stuck to the carpet, and the feathers and balls were too big) so I had to pick it all up by hand.\" 13 Kid Vs. Shaving Cream Jennifer Sherman \"Shaving cream from one end of the house to the other. I couldn't even be mad because when I first saw her she said 'BOO!'\" 14 Kids Vs. Shredded Paper Shannon Shrock \"Where was I when this happened? Cluelessly downstairs enjoying listening to their laughter and squeals. Took four adults two hours to clean up. Of course we had the munchkins help too. Bags and bags of shredded paper all over two rooms and the hallway.\" 15 Kid Vs. Baby Powder, Part III Brenda Gayle Massey \"Poured the Baby Powder EVERYWHERE. And he was SO proud of himself!\" 16 Kid Vs. Diaper Cream Kate Puleo Unger \"My son was supposed to be taking a nap, and then it got eerily quiet. I found him like this! Diaper cream all over himself. I guess the bed was too close to his dresser. Oops! Instead of a nap, he got a bath. And he got me laughing instead of yelling. How could I not? He looks ridiculous!\" 17 Kid Vs. Couch \"My 3-year-old found the tiniest hole in couch....\" 18 Kid Vs.
