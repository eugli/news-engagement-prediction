The vote was hailed by the eurosceptic Mail, which has been a vocal cheerleader of the UK quitting the European Union for years. MAIL: We have lift off! #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/VuStZA8WC9 — Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) February 1, 2017 \nIn its sub-headline, the newspaper suggested MPs who trotted through the ‘no’ lobby had tempered its joy, declaring: “114 MPs betray will of the people.” \nFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage echoed the sentiment, arguing the “114 enemies of democracy should be made to pay the price at the ballot box”. Here is a list of 114 enemies of democracy who should be made to pay the price at the ballot box. https://t.co/WgVe4d4F1t — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) February 1, 2017 \nThe charges are reminiscent of a Daily Mail front page in November when three Supreme Court judges were branded “enemies of the people” after the successful Article 50 challenge. \nThe Court ruled May cannot trigger Brexit without first consulting Parliament, a decision which left many Leave supporters furious. Daily Mail \nMany of the MPs voting against the ‘Brexit Bill’ argue their constituencies, which they were elected to represent, voted to Remain and are therefore reflecting their wishes. SNP MPs make a similar contention, pointing out Scotland voted against Brexit. \nBut not all of them represent Remain areas. Labour MP Chris Bryant, whose South Wales constituency voted to Leave, said in the Commons he was “voting and speaking on behalf of a minority of my constituents”. As I said in chamber today, this country was built on the sweat,courage and ingenuity of migrants who wanted to help make this country great pic.twitter.com/LhdpbN18BW — Chris Bryant MP (@RhonddaBryant) February 1, 2017 \nMPs responded to the charges on Twitter. The SNP’s John Nicolson took Farage to task, urging the MEP - who has failed six times to become an MP - to challenge him in his East Dunbartonshire constituency. Feel free to stand against me Nigel. Nothing would give me more pleasure than exposing your cant and bluster in a campaign. https://t.co/9TX5brz4RR — JOHN NICOLSON M.P. (@MrJohnNicolson) February 1, 2017 \nMeanwhile, Labour’s Stella Creasy was condemned by Ukip donor and Farage associate Arron Banks. The people voted in a massive exercise of participative democracy. You voted to kick them the in the nether regions! Shame https://t.co/BoztMglX7t — Arron Banks (@Arron_banks) February 1, 2017 \nThe Walthamstow MP made clear the vote was not about whether Brexit happens. Many are demanding further details on the terms of quitting the EU before giving their consent. Vote wasn't about whether Brexit happens but how. Surprised UKIP wanted to green light giving TM power to choose- what if she reneges? https://t.co/NEfpBvdaeM", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:05:14.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
