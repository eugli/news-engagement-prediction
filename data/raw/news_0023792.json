They just want to find ways to make you change your life. They want to change how you live because your way is the wrong way. \nIt's a religion, a cult, and we're constantly being berated by hypocrites. \nFirst it was global warming, then climate change, and now what? Are we supposed to be climate fluid? \nIt's impossible to predict what will happen. The climate is fine, you will live, and California has rain.
