But that didn't win over one bouncer   \nMost girls would love to look as good as Adam Murphy in a minidress and high heels. \nBut Adam’s style statement did not meet with the approval of a bouncer at a popular Manchester bar - who he says REFUSED him entry saying it was not the pub’s policy to allow “men wearing dresses” inside. \nHairdresser Adam, who likes to mix masculine and feminine fashions, turned up ready to enjoy a night out at the Slug and Lettuce pub on Deansgate in his glitzy silver sequin minidress and black thigh high stiletto boots with friend Thomas Robinson in matching silver trousers. Adam Murphy, right, in the dress that caused all the trouble - and his friend, left, in silver trousers \nBut he says the bar’s doorman had other ideas.

Wow. One of Adam's even more head-turning outfits. Check out the bunny ears... \n“I asked to speak to a manager, but he said that she was busy. I was embarrassed and it made me feel horrible. You don’t expect anything like this to happen in Manchester.” Read More An all day cinema screening 1980s movies is opening in Manchester \nAdam and Thomas had earlier that day headed to the open auditions for the new series of Channel Five reality show Big Brother in the city centre, so had made a particular effort to look glamorous. \nAdam said: “When it was clear he wasn’t going to let us in at the Slug and Lettuce, we left there and went just along Deansgate to The Living Room, where they were fine with what I was wearing. Adam in a more masculine mode - he says he likes to mix male and female styles and always wears high heels to work \n“I wasn’t dressed like a tramp, I wasn’t that extreme, and I wasn’t in a joke outfit - on a weekend and nights out in Manchester this is how I would normally dress.” \nAdam works as a hairdresser in the city centre and says he always likes to mix both masculine and feminine fashions - and proudly wears high heels to work every day. \nHe says: “How can you talk about equal rights when a woman wearing this type of outfit is let into a pub but not me?

This does not reflect our company policy and the doorman in question is no longer employed at the venue. We have apologised personally for any offence caused.” \nThe Slug and Lettuce chain, which has 70 pubs across the UK, boasts on its website of offering a “comfy, safe, welcoming environment” to all customers. \nAdam admits the way he likes to dress does attract attention, but he is proud of his individual style. \nHe says: “I like to switch the masculine and feminine looks up, and I do get a lot of homophobic comments thrown my way but I’m not going to let that get in the way of how I want to live my life.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T20:16:12.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
