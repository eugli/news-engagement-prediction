But differences between the two cropped up as Rio, denied a berth in the Narendra Modi government, was trying to take over the reins in the state again. \nRio allegedly seized the opportunity after the row over women’s quota in the cancelled civic body polls made tribal organisations demand Zeliang’s resignation . \nZeliang is in Delhi since Thursday after NPF legislators, in a meeting the previous night, backed the 81-year-old Liezietsu as their next chief minister. There were 42 MLAs in that meeting, 33 of them from NPF. \n“The BJP helped Zeliang and Rio patch up in Delhi for the latter to take over as chief minister,” the NPF leader said. \nNagaland governor PB Acharya was also in Delhi on Thursday, though NPF said it was coincidental that his travel plan matched with that of the chief minister. \nDespite Acharya’s absence, the DAN Legislature Party—BJP and NPF formed the Democratic Alliance of Nagaland (DAN)—had on Friday submitted a letter to the Raj Bhavan in Kohima assuring MLAs’ support to Liezietsu. \nRead: Nagaland crisis: NPF MLAs back Shurozelie for next CM; Zeliang to step down \nAcharya, Zeliang and Rio are scheduled to reach Dimapur, Nagaland’s commercial hub, on Saturday afternoon. \nIn Tamil Nadu, more than 120 MLAs were huddled off to a resort outside Chennai earlier this month as acting chief minister O Panneerselvam revolted against AIADMK general secretary Sasikala, who was set to take over from him.
