Brown/Getty Images. There is perhaps no film institution more publicly loathed by actors than the Golden Raspberry Awards, an annual show that judges the worst Hollywood has to offer. Year after year, stars are nominated for Razzies—and while some are supremely good-natured about it ( Halle Berry, for example) others are furious to see their names even get mentioned. But no actor seems to hate the Razzies more than Sylvester Stallone, according to Razzie founder and president John Wilson, who shared a funny anecdote about the Oscar nominee's vendetta against The Hollywood Reporter. Despite his legendary career and comfy place in action-movie history, it seems to really bother Stallone that he's been nominated for more than two dozen Razzies. The final straw apparently came in 2000, when the snarky ceremony nominated Sly for worst actor of the century. Enough was finally enough. “When he heard he was up for Worst Actor of the Century, we did get a voice mail that sounded like him — for legal reasons we can’t say it was him,” Wilson told T.H.R. “But his point was, my movies make money, stop picking on me.'” It's true: Stallone's most recent big release, the Rocky sequel Creed, made nearly $110 million domestically , and netted Stallone a supporting actor Oscar nomination to boot. Of course, continued Wilson, “you’re not exempt from the Razzies if your movie made money.” Stallone isn't the only star to take issue with the Razzies. Wilson also recalled the time director Uwe Boll, often knocked as one of the worst filmmakers of all time , made a somewhat sarcastic video in response to being nominated multiple times, calling Wilson an “asshole.” “I think he meant it to be funny, but he was pissed off, where he kept mispronouncing the awards. It was absolutely hilarious—and well-deserved,” Wilson says. Hey, not everyone can be like Sandra Bullock —who not only won a Razzie the same year she won her Oscar for The Blind Side, but actually showed up at the ceremony to make a hilarious acceptance speech.
