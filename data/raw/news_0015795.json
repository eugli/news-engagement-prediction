Costing him \"tens of millions of dollars\" and leading to financial trouble, of which he claims to have only become aware of in March of last year. \nThe cross-complaint, filed this week, stated that TMG \"did everything within its power over the last 17 years to protect Depp from himself and to keep Depp financially solvent\" but that TMG \"did not have the power or ability to control Deppâ€™s spending or his numerous other vices, or to force Depp to make wiser financial decisions.\" \nThe lawsuit lifts the lid, in extraordinary detail, on Depp's alleged \"extravagant and extreme\" $2 million a month spending habit. We took a look through to discover how the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" star splurges his earnings. All of our figures are quoted in the TMG lawsuit, which is available in full here. \nFollow BI Video: On Twitter More Rich & Famous", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:13:42.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
