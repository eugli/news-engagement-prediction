can order rojak to go with the cendol at the stall opposite the Taman Bahagia LRT station. \nWHEN I was asked to list some of my favourite cendol stalls in the Klang Valley, I had intended specifically to list out those selling tapai (fermented glutinous rice) as a topping. \nUnfortunately, an all- tapai cendol list was rejected. \nGrowing up in Malacca, which is popular with the weekend hordes for its Nyonya Cendol, my concept of this popular dessert for a long time did not entail adding cincau (grass jelly) and jagung ( corn ) into the mix. \nSo, as I learnt to appreciate adding pulut and jagung in my cendol, the next step was tapai , with its sweet-and-sour flavour contrasting with the rich taste of the basic dessert. \nJalan 17/41A \nWith its location so close to Menara Star, Petaling Jaya, this is definitely one of my picks, if nothing else, just for its proximity. \nPreviously known as Cendol Mustaffa, the business has now been split into two trucks – one selling cendol and the other rojak . \nWith its popularity among the college kids and Section 17 residents, you might have to queue up to get your own bowl of icy cool cendol to beat away the afternoon heat. \nSS2 Petaling Jaya \nLocated along Jalan SS2/5, opposite the Taman Bahagia LRT station, this is another cendol truck that is popular with Prasarana employees, teachers and residents on SS2’s Chow Yang side. \nOpening from 11am onwards, the ingredients do not vary much, with red beans and jagung in the mix, and pulut as an option. \nIt is popular especially on weekends, but the only drawback is the lack of parking space, so some patience may be required rather than blocking part of Jalan SS2/3. \nOld Town Food Court \nLocated near the Jalan Othman traffic lights, Stall No 46, with the business name “Gerai Minuman Weng Kee” is one of THE cendol stalls to try out, not least due to its consistency. \nThe first time I ordered my cendol , the stall owner’s husband took out a tall glass with a ball of ice inside, asked where I was sitting, then proceeded to pass it to his wife to fill in the ingredients. \nFinely shaved ice, with just red beans at the bottom, layers of green noodles and doused with coconut milk and gula melaka , this simple order is a treat to finish at RM3 per glass. \nCendol Bakar, Kuala Selangor \nI don’t think any cendol list would be complete without Cendol Bakar in Kampung Assam Jawa, on the way to Kuala Selangor. \nWith its myriad of ingredients, this is also the first stall where I tasted tapai in my cendol . \nOther than the regular cendol , you also have VIP (nata de coco, basil seeds with jagung and beans), and VVIP (VIP with pulut ), tapai and durian cendol, which sell for only RM4 (cheaper compared to other places in urban Klang Valley). \nLebuh Keluli, Section 7 Shah Alam \nAlong Lebuh Keluli, a turn-off on the left if you are heading down the New North Klang Straits Bypass, there is a large open-air tarmac next to Lorong Keluli 1B where food trucks operate during the day. \nOne of these trucks, run by a chap who introduced himself as Shon, sells a variety of cendol , including with durian (priced at a steep RM6) as well as Laksa Utara. \nOpinions differed among my colleagues on the taste of the tapai , with some saying it was “just nice” while another found it too sweet. \nPersonally, I felt the balance was just nice, although Shon, who cooks the tapai himself, said his skills paled compared to his grandfather’s, who had previously overseen the fermentation process for the tapai .", "external_links":
