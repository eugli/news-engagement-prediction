Post Your Comments Share Cancel Moneycontrol Bureau A call centre employee recently returned from a trip to a State Bank of India ATM in South Delhi with fake Rs 2,000 notes that mentioned ‘Children’s Bank of India’ as the issuing authority and had a ‘Churan Lable’ instead of the Ashoka Chakra among a slew of inaccuracies, according to a report in Hindustan Times.The report quoted a senior police officer as confirming the development and said that the ATM had dispensed four such notes to the customer. A sub-inspector who visited the ATM also received a fake Rs 2,000 note but found that all other notes in the bundle were genuine.The other errors on the note included the mention of a Bharatiya Manorajan Bank, a missing rupee symbol and governor’s signature, a ‘PK’ logo instead of the RBI seal, and a ‘promise to pay the barer two thousand coupens’ (sic).The incident took place on February 6. No other customer has made a similar complaint. The police are yet to identify the culprits and a case has been registered. A SBI spokesman was quoted as saying that the bank would send a team to investigate the matter.Earlier this week, Border Security Forces seized a consignment of fake Rs 2,000 denomination notes near the Bangladesh border totaling Rs 96,000. Unlike in the SBI incident, however, the seized notes were much closer to resembling the genuine Rs 2,000 note. Buy , Hold , Sell ?
