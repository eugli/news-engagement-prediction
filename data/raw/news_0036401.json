By the time she was in the hallway the fire had spread into her unit. \n“The fire in the bedroom had lit through the wall and my whole office was on fire,” she said. “It was red everywhere and hot. \n“I panicked. And the smoke was so bad I couldn’t see and my throat was burning and my eyes were watering,” she said. “You don’t know how you’re going to react… You panic because the fire is coming and the smoke and you gotta get out. \n“I just flew out and came out with my bathrobe and my coat and that’s it.” \nWatch below: Resident Mary Jean Slaunwhide was inside at the time of the fire and explained the dramatic steps she had to take to get out. \nFrom there, Kennedy said she could do nothing but stand and watch as 14 years of memories went up in flames. \n“I was just watching my whole world just burn up.” \nShe said her downstairs neighbour told her his roommate started the fire. \n“He told me that it started in his place. He said, ‘it’s not my fault, it’s not my fault. She started it.'” \nKennedy said she and other residents have been concerned the man was storing gasoline in his suite. \n“It was in the last couple weeks. I came home from work a couple times and there was a very strong smell of gas.” \nWatch below: As large and destructive as a fire at a west Edmonton apartment building was Thursday morning, fire crews say they’re happy because it could have been much worse. Fletcher Kent reports. \nIt’s not known when or if residents will be allowed to return home. Kennedy said she feels overwhelmed. \n“I’m trying to think that it’s going to be OK. I’ve got good insurance so everything will be covered, I can replace it. But you don’t go out today and replace $50,000 worth of belongings. \n“It takes a long time to build it all back up again.” \nThe Red Cross said it is currently assisting 46 people forced out of their homes by the fire. \nWatch below: Video from the Global 1 news helicopter of a large fire at the Westridge Estates B apartment complex in west Edmonton’s Callingwood area. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
