They merge but they take a dislike to each other and for some reason the groups were deciding last night they’d have a go,” he said. Police are forming a wall. There are hundreds here. @theheraldsun pic.twitter.com/IMoHreY3MC — Brianna Travers (@briannatravers) February 18, 2017 \nHundreds of police swarmed the area, including members of the mounted branch and public response order unit, standing between the opposing groups who “looked like they were going to flare up”, according to Mr Leane. \nAsked if he thought the trouble was linked to the Apex gang, which disrupted last year’s Moomba parade, he said, “I’m not sure if Apex even still exists.” \nInstead, he described the potential participants as “networked” offenders.
