The following year it was named 'UK Cinema of the Year' . \nThe cinema group operates under a tenancy licence agreement from the council.

Mr Watkins-Hughes said he was confident the building would soon reopen. \n\"It's been a hugely difficult time for us,\" he said. \n\"It is inconceivable that we won't reopen our doors again soon.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T09:23:49.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
