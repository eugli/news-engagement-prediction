February 2, 2017 11:37 PM by Liana Satenstein Photo: Getty Images For celebrities, airports have become personal runways with an aesthetic all their own . Athleisure is the biggest influence, with style stars like Bella Hadid , Kendall Jenner , and Selena Gomez sporting Tony Soprano tracksuits, often incongruously paired with heels or boots. Then comes the messy-chic topknot and sunglasses, glimpsed as the famous faces zip by the paparazzi with quasi-ducked heads. The result is casual glamour, designed to be photographed, but still exuding a “no cameras, please” vibe. Sure, this frequent-flier look works for celebrities who recline in first-class seats or take private planes, but what about an ordinary citizen? Could someone like me, an anonymous writer living in Bushwick, Brooklyn, pull it off? We can only learn by doing. So, I tried a comfort-meets-luxury ensemble a few days ago when headed to the airport for a flight to Kiev. For inspiration, I used Bella Hadid’s look from last May when she stomped through LAX in a red Adidas tracksuit and a teeny black sports bra, flashing an expanse of toned abdomen. My preflight routine remained pedestrian: I hit the laundromat at the last minute, then hurriedly threw a week’s worth of clothing into a massive green suitcase from high school while calling a car. But that day, I did it all in a black TNA tracksuit and a Nike-emblazoned sports bra, topping it all off with a choker and a pair of pointy-toe boots. Call me the bootleg Bella of Brooklyn.

Photo: Courtesy of Liana Satenstein My bravado was in full force while waiting for my car, despite my midriff being out in the open—not my usual style. I didn’t even panic when the GPS went out and we got lost for 20 minutes. When we finally made it to Terminal 7, I had my confused driver take a photo of me as a gust of cold wind slapped my exposed stomach. Proud and beaming, I sent it to a colleague, whose response was, “Doing celeb style at the airport? I think your suitcase is too big.” I ignored this. Bella Hadid would have, too. Inside the terminal, I found myself engulfed by a crowd of well-groomed British Airways passengers. Athleisure was not in their fashion vocabulary, at least while traveling, and the attendant who politely gave me directions to my airline also gave my pierced navel the once-over . Things changed, though, when I reached the Ukraine International Airlines counters. At baggage check, I spotted at least three other Kiev-bound women wearing tracksuits. One, who was arguing with the attendant about overweight baggage, had raised the stakes by wearing one in hot pink. I almost fit in, with one crucial difference: My sports bra and the stretch of skin between it and the top of my track pants. 1 / 5 Tna Columbia pants, $65, aritzia.com ; R13 stacked combat boots, $1,195, shopbop.com ; Vanessa Mooney velvet choker, $33, shopbop.com ; Tna Sandur jacket, $63, aritzia.com ; Tna whitecap hoodie, $75, aritzia.com Typically when I’m self-conscious, I cover up, but for some reason, that day my bare belly gave me a surge of confidence, even though I hadn’t done a sit-up in about two months. I waltzed through security with my jacket unzipped until a TSA agent stopped me and said she had to feel my chest. She was worried my abbreviated top might have a piece of metal in it. After a 30-second grope, I headed toward my gate—slightly less confident, as evidenced by my now half-zipped jacket. In this modest ensemble, I decided to add another celebrity accessory: a $6 Smartwater. After the requisite wait at the gate, I finally boarded. It was nearly empty, save a man reading The Da Vinci Code in the row next to me. All the space felt luxurious. How many times does a person get a row to themselves? Barely any! At that moment, comfortably sprawled out, I felt I was getting close to the celebrity in-flight experience. I decided that if Bella Hadid ever chose to take Ukraine International Airlines, she would likely opt for a similar look, perhaps even the same tracksuit. When the flight attendant offered me a pair of blue socks from the airline, I accepted, feeling that they would add a crisp pop of contrast to my otherwise all-black outfit. I reclined, took a sip of my Smartwater, popped a Tylenol PM, and unzipped my jacket, once again brazenly showing my abdomen. It was a travel look worthy of the newswires. I’m sure Hadid would agree.
