I would be proud to see anyone I love succeed, so I’m sure anyone who loves me is proud of me right now.” \nWyatt went on to add that his title win was even sweeter, as he was able to prove his past critics wrong. PROVING THE CRITICS WRONG \nHe added: “To me, it was an up-yours to the authority, because when I walked into this, I don’t think anyone ever looked at me and said, ‘One day you’re going to be WWE Champion.' \n“I’ve seen so many come and go over the years, and so many that look the part and thought they were something special and they just weren’t. And someone like me, I had to cut my teeth for years just to be recognised. No one looked at my direction. \n“I had to grab them by the throat and make them look me in the eyes and say, ‘Look at me.’ This is a huge accomplishment for me, because no one else expected it but I always did. \n“This pretty much tells me I’m in the main event at WrestleMania. That’s pretty cool.” \nIt’s great to see Bray let his guard down for once, and the passion is there for all to see as you can tell just how much this means to him. \nWhat do you make of Bray Wyatt’s WWE Championship win?
