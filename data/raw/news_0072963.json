But if you’re being strategic about your annual leave this year, why not satisfy your wanderlust urges by visiting a country that’s ‘doable’ in just a day? It’s easy to forget that London is ideally placed for a quick getaway. Sitting on mainland Europe’s doorstep, there are a surprising number of bucket list destinations that are just a few hours away by plane - making for the perfect spontaneous getaway.

Amsterdam W Amsterdam - hotel review Some flights to Amsterdam take just one hour, leaving you plenty of time to do a whistle-stop tour of the main attractions. Catch an early flight and you can take a brunch boat through the historic canals, quaffing champagne and eating avocado on toast as you take in the higgledy piggledy 18th century buildings. If you’re feeling brave, hire a bike and pedal through the pretty cobbled streets or simply sit at a pavement cafe sipping on a cappuccino and watching the world go by. Paris Let the City of Love be your date for the day. The French capital is just a Netflix episode away from London - with some flights lasting just 45 minutes. Take in the cityscape vista from the Sacré-Cœur in Montmartre, have a picnic lunch at the Eiffel Tower and wander around the lamp post-lined patchwork of villages and neighbourhoods.
