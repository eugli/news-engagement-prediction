PUBLISHED: 22:38, Tue, Feb 7, 2017 | UPDATED: 22:46, Tue, Feb 7, 2017 GETTY Most Europeans actually want a Muslim ban similar to that proposed by Donald Trump \nAn average of 55 per cent of people surveyed from 10 European countries said they would supported a policy similar to the one proposed by US president Donald Trump , according to a poll by think tank Chatham House. \nWhen asked how they felt about the statement “All further migration from mainly Muslim countries should be stopped”, a clear majority replied “agree” rather than “disagree”. \nDespite protests in London and other EU capitals, every country surveyed saw clear support for a move similar to Mr Trump’s controversial ban among respondents.

Documents hint at new policy \nThe poll, which used responses from 10,000 people and was carried out before Mr Trump signed his executive order, was supported by 71 per cent of respondents in Poland, 65 per cent in Austria, 54 per cent in Germany and 51 per cent in Italy. GETTY Protestors across the world have staged huge demonstrations against his immigration executive order \nSpain and the UK were the only two countries where less than half of respondents supported a Muslim travel ban: 41 per cent in Spain and 47 per cent in the UK. \nHowever, this number still trumped the 32 per cent and 23 per cent of respondents in the respective two states which said they outright opposed such a ban. \nChatham House said the poll results were “striking and sobering” and showed support for a travel ban for Muslim majority countries extended far beyond the White House.
