'Experimental methods' \nResearchers then conducted a range of brain scans, while asking the adolescents to carry out tasks that could win them cash prizes at the same time. \nThe tests were designed to look at how particular parts of the brain responded to the prospect of getting a reward. \nThey found those teenagers who had less nerve activity in these brain areas during these tasks, were more likely to have drug problems two years later. \nOne theory behind this, the scientists say, is that teenagers who are more likely to take drugs have less motivation for traditional rewards like money, and more for less conventional rewards. \nProf Brian Knutson, at Stanford University, says he hopes with more work, these types of tests could help identify vulnerable teenagers who could be offered help before problems arise. \nMeanwhile Prof Derek Hill, of University College London, said the study was \"interesting\" with carefully collected and analysed data. \nBut he cautioned that the methods used in the study were still experimental. \nHe added: \"It is therefore important that results like this are replicated in separate studies before the results in this paper should be used to change the way these young people are diagnosed and treated.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:07:26.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
