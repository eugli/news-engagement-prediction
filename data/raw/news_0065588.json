With the meet tied up, 11-11, consecutive wins by Madeleine Chang and Christine Choi at foil gave the Knights some breathing room. \nThe sabre squad was on point for the Knights with Casey Chan and Chou sweeping their three bouts each. \n\"It definitely felt like a culmination of the entire season,\" said senior Catherine McNamara . \"We've fought in every single thing we've entered and we've had a really great season. So, it just felt like a nice end.\" \nLooking back from when they were freshmen, McNamara and Chou can vouch for just how far the senior class has come from when the group first started fencing and Bergen Tech did not even win a round in the state tournament. \n\"We started at a much different place than we ended,\" said McNamara. \"My freshman year we would struggle through dual meets throughout the season. It feels very fulfilling to get this far now, and know we really deserve it.\" \n\"In our freshman year, people would say 'Bergen Tech', and there would not be much of a reaction,\" said Chou. \"To come all the way from just another team to the best team in the state has been absolutely amazing. We could not have done it without the hard work of everybody on this team.\" \nWhen Safavi first took over the program six years ago he saw that there was talent, but the skills had to be molded and moved toward the right direction for the fencing team to reach its potential. \n\"When I first took over, nobody really knew Bergen Tech had a fencing program -- and if they knew, they were like 'who cares?',\" said Safavi. \"The thing that boggles my mind is that Bergen Tech had great fencers and great athletes, but there was no structure to the program. It was not like a traditional varsity program.\" \n\"I took what I learned from my high school coach and my college coach, and I applied that to fencing. I've turned it little by little to a true varsity program with organization, leadership and management.\" \nThe state championship concluded a season in which Bergen Tech also won its first Santelli Tournament and the District 5 tournament. \n\"It's really cool to know that it's such a young program, said McNamara. \"We got so lucky with such amazing fencers. I think the stars aligned, but we put in so much hard work that it's just a long time coming.\" \nMarissa Viqueira was 3-0 for Columbia at foil and Isabelle Wendt was 3-0 at epee. \nContact Matt Bove at .
