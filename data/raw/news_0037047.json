All would converge to illustrate the point that labelling something a phobia or phobic in modern political discourse is at least as often a facile attempt to suppress arguments and shut down debates, as it is an apt and faithful description of one of the parties (that they are bigots and haters) to those arguments and debates. That is to say, it is as much, or as often, a term of artful and partisan rhetoric as it is a description of a real and prejudiced state of mind. \nSo with the controversy over the parliamentary motion that has wound up our political class towards week’s end, perhaps some of its energies come from the unstable nature of the term which is at the centre of the debate: Islamophobia. Simply put, the term does not have a fixed and commonly shared understanding, it is variously deployed and variously understood, and it is both a term of rhetoric and a term designating real and prejudicial animosity towards Muslims. \nI would suggest that in the current dustup, most but not all of the most fervent advocates of either side are choosing the side of the coin, the shades of the term, which places them on the heroic side of the contention. The pro-Motion side quickly essentializes their opponents with the schoolyard taunt of “How can you not be against hate?” For its part, the anti-motion dervishes summon the spectre of the collapse of our free speech rights and creeping sharia. Neither side wishes to make too obvious what is in fact obvious to anyone detached from the theatrical fireworks — that it is posture politics and virtue-signalling on both sides. \nIt is, after all, just a parliamentary motion, which is, not to put too fine a point on the matter, merely a political billboard on which to advertise ones political virtues. It points to no real action. To the degree that there is Islamophobia in Canada a motion will not reduce it. To the degree that there is a significant threat to our free speech opposition to this motion will not diminish it. This is a factitious controversy, one summoned to advance political positions, and elicit hosannas from the respective bases of our political parties. It is another episode in the endless and increasingly ugly manipulations of cultural frictions, inevitable in our modern society, to secure party fealty, or achieve partisan identification. All in all, I’d say we could have done just as well without it. \nNational Post ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T10:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:08:51.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
