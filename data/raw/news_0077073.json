It turns out the professional nurse did not just wear her dress for attention but actually for the hype in preparation for her latest realese. \nShe took toTwitter to announce the release of her track, which basically tells women to flaunt their bodies without shame (see what she did there?). She also borrowed from Riky Rick's speech and said the rapper encouraged artists to release their music on the net and she heeded that advice. \nAnd her album will be ready in April! I really shut it down at #mma16 . Now it's time to download my song and hear my #Umzimba https://t.co/2rwylnaAIu https://t.co/lilH6qeXm1 I knew there was some other motive behind the dress.
