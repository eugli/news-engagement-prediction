I'm so sad [that he's quit] but I'm just happy I got to work with him. 'He's such a generous actor.' As reported by Digital Spy, Peter wasn't the only outgoing star to offer up some sage words to the young actress. She'll miss him: Having only been able to work with him for one run of new episodes, Pearl - who plays Bill - has admitted how sad it is to see him go '[Former star Jenna Coleman said] I didn't need any advice [except] not to eat the faggots in the canteen.' Having dropped the bombshell overnight last Monday, it wasn't long before the rumour mill went into over-drive when it came to who would be the thirteenth doctor. And following his own announcement that he was quitting Death In Paradise after four years, so that he can spend less time away from his family, Kris Marshall was thrust into the mix. Almost immediately, speculation began to spin on social media as to the real reason Kris Marshall had chosen to quit his role on the hugely popular series. Avid BBC viewers seem to be under the impression that Marshall is transferring his skills as a Detective to that of the Doctor - and is in the running to play Doctor Who in the wake of Peter's decision to leave. The new Doctor? Following his own announcement that he was quitting Death In Paradise after four years Kris Marshall was thrust into the running by fans 'Maybe a coincidence but since Doctor Who needs a new lead, interesting that that Kris Marshall has now quit Death in Paradise.

He'd be perfect. #doctorwho!' The theory proved popular as the news spread that Marshall is leaving the role of Detective Inspector Humphrey Goodman. 'So Kris Marshall leaves #DeathInParadise, just as they're starting to look for a new #DoctorWho... #Coincidence...?? ;-)' a fourth person theorised. 'Huh so Kris Marshall leaves Death in Paradise around the same time Peter Capaldi leaves Doctor Who. Hmm, interesting...' a fifth wrote. Time to go: Peter announced his decision to quit as the twelfth Doctor on Monday night - prompting a flurry of actors and actress to be thrust into the running for number 13 Speculation: Avid BBC viewers seem to be under the impression that Marshall is transferring his skills as a Detective to a Doctor - and is in the running to play Doctor Who in the wake of Peter Capaldi's decision to leave Some didn't seem too keen on the idea. 'If Kris Marshall is the new #DoctorWho they might as well cast a toilet brush. Dull,' a fan seethed. The 43-year-old actor - whose big break came in the form of BBC sitcom My Family - revealed on Thursday's episode of Good Morning Britain that the decision was made in order to spend more time with his family after his daughter was born last year, leaving him 'bereft' while away filming in the Caribbean.

I'm still thinking whether I've made the right decision' It has been confirmed that after he departs the show, he will be replaced by Father Ted funnyman Ardal O'Hanlan, who will play Detective Inspector Jack Mooney, a role he debuts in Thursday night's episode of the show. Kris said of the decision to quit: 'I've loved it. It's time to move on and give someone else some sun. I'm still thinking whether I've made the right decision.

He admitted he struggled being away from his family for filming, saying: 'For the last few years I have been able to take them with me but we had a daughter and this last series I did on my own.
