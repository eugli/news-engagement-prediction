HAMISH MCNEILLY/FAIRFAX NZ \nA security guard was posted outside the Cadbury factory in Dunedin before news of the closure was announced. \nThe plan appears to have met market approval, with shareholders - including many KiwiSaver schemes like those of Westpac and ASB - driving up the price of Mondelez shares from US$26 in late 2013 to just over US$42. \nREAD MORE: * Oscar Kightley: 'Cadbury's not so sweet now' \nMondelez has been investing in new factories, but they are not in wealthy countries like New Zealand. That has led to claims overseas the company could undermine the ability of people in countries losing factories to buy its luxury snack products. \nThe cost-cutting drive began in 2014, when \"activist\" shareholders expressed unhappiness about Mondelez's profit margins. \nIn February 2014, the Financial Times broke the news, reporting: \"Mondelez has hired Accenture to help it implement a severe cost-control budgeting system.\" \nThe newspaper said: \"The move comes as Mondelez, the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum, works to streamline operations and deliver US$3b in gross productivity savings over three years.\" \nThe company has recommitted to that plan repeatedly in the months and years since, including in February 2015 at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference, speaking to fund managers and stock-brokers. Ad Feedback \nMulti-national companies like Mondelez are not beholden to local populations. It is the interests of shareholders which drive them, and despite Kiwisaver schemes having stakes in Mondelez, the vast majority of its shares are not held by New Zealand-based investors. \nModelez's chief executive Irene Rosenfeld told analysts at the 2015 conference: \"We'll continue to prioritise margin expansion and earnings growth while delivering modest organic revenue growth, as we progress our transformation agenda to focus our portfolio on snacks, reduce costs and invest for long-term growth.\" \nKey to future profitability has been a shift in production to cheap manufacturing locations, including Brazil, China and India. \nDaniel Myers, Mondelez's executive vice president for \"integrated supply chain\", told the analysts: \"When we started our journey, only 15 percent of our 'Power Brands' were produced on advantaged assets. By 2018, we expect that number to be about 70 percent.\" \nPower brands are its hero brands like Oreos and Cadbury. The term \"advantaged assets\" is often repeated by world media, but not defined. \nAdvantaged assets are factories \"in advantaged locations at advantaged costs\", Myers told analysts. \nThe latest recommitment to the cost-cutting strategy to which Dunedin workers are falling victim was in September last year, when Mondelez's bid to take over US chocolate maker Hershey fell through. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported: \"Now that a takeover of Hershey is off the table, snack giant Mondelez International and its chief executive Irene Rosenfeld have signalled that ongoing cost cutting will be the way to profitability.\" \nThe worldwide cost-savings drive has also led to changes in some Mondelez products, and some conditions for workers and ex-workers, reported Britain's Daily Telegraph , including down-sizing its products, swapping to cheaper ingredients, and stopping sending ex-workers chocolate at Christmas. \nThe global cost-cutting programme is being recognised in Otago. \nThe E tÅ« union's Chas Muir, who criticised Mondelez's warnings to Dunedin factory employees not to speak to the media, said: \"Mondelez appears to have a global strategy of slashing costs and jobs to bolster shareholder returns regardless of the consequences to communities, and this strategy needs to be challenged.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T08:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:21:15.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
