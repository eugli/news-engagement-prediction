Â© Reuters KUALA LUMPUR -- Malaysian authorities have arrested a fourth suspect in the killing on Monday of Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Police detained a 47-year-old man bearing a North Korean passport on Friday night, The Star online news reported. He is one of four people believed to be involved in Kim's assassination inside Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2, the Malaysian capital's budget terminal. Malaysian authorities have arrested three other suspects: a 28-year-old Vietnamese woman, a 25-year-old Indonesian woman, and the latter's Malaysian boyfriend. The women are reported to have told investigators they were paid to wipe Kim's face with a liquid as a prank. North Korea has said it rejects the autopsy conducted in Malaysia because it did not participate. \"We will categorically reject the result of the postmortem conducted unilaterally excluding our attendance,\" North Korean ambassador Kang Chol told reporters late on Friday night. In a rare appearance to make his first statement since the incident, the envoy claimed that Kim, whom he described as a citizen, died from a heart attack. He said his government opposed any autopsy because Kim was \"a diplomatic passport holder and our citizen who is under the consular protection\". The envoy said Malaysian authorities have been asked to release Kim Jong Nam's body \"without further delay\". They said the corpse could only be released to next of kin. \"It is normal procedure as we cannot release the body to just anyone,\" said Abdul Samah Mat, police chief of Selangor. \"There must be some form of verification.\" Related stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T19:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:08:44.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
