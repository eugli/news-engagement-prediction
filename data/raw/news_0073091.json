If you are part time, you are going to stay in the Western Cape and you will be called in as and when there are committees in Johannesburg,” said Bongo. \nCommittee chairperson Mathole Motshekga warned: “We have said we don’t want commissioners who act in silos. We have seen the problem of acting in silos. It has created the [Life Esidimeni] disaster the nation is mourning.” \nMotshekga said the law states that the seat of the commission is in Johannesburg and commissioners should be based in Johannesburg. \n“I am not convinced that we need province-based commissioners and part-time commissioners who are solely attached to their provinces,” Motshekga said, adding that the effectiveness of the organisation depends on a strong centre. \nMotshekga later told City Press that he thought the proposal was about “convenience”. \n“If I have my family in the Northern Cape, I would prefer to be there. People do not want to move and they will give you all sorts of reasons.” Join the conversation! \n24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24 .
