Whether he will want to stay in England and play for another club in England? Rooney exploded onto the scene at Everton in 2002 \n“I think maybe America may be more suited to him, do what Steven Gerrard did, do what David Beckham did, I think the lifestyle will be better over there. \n“But I don’t want to get too far ahead of myself, he’s 31. OK there is good players in this team now, but I hope there is still a bit of fight left in him.” \nRooney only became the club's record goalscorer last month after a stunning last-minute free-kick against Stoke City. \nAnd another former team-mate, Roy Keane, believes it would be 'madness' if Rooney moved to China when he is still only 31. Oscar, Carlos Tevez and Ramires all play in China \n\"There's no way Wayne Rooney should be going to China,\" he said on ITV's Champions League highlights show. \n\"He can still play football and still play at the top level in England, Germany, Spain, Italy. Madness. \n\"Going to China? Madness. He's 31-years of age. There's plenty left yet for Wayne Rooney to do in Europe. I don't think he's short of money is he.\" \nGet all the latest Manchester United news first with our new app. Download it here now.
