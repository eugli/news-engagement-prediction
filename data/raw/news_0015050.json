I didn't hate it, but I didn't look like Dan Carter either and that bothered me. \nIt took 10 years of five-times-a-week gym sessions and countless forms of protein-rich diets to get to the point where now, in my 30s, I'm happy(ish) with my body. \nStill, I'm six foot (1.83m) tall and have never cracked 70kg. In fact, when I weigh myself at the gym, I ensure no other men can see the number on the scales because I'm afraid I'll be outed as that skinny 14-year-old I sometimes still feel like inside. \nBody dysmorphic disorder, whereby what you see in the mirror doesn't match reality, affects just as many men as women, according to University of Melbourne and Brown University researchers. Ad Feedback \nIn men, this is often typified as muscle dysmorphic disorder (MDD), colloquially known as \"reverse anorexia\" or \"bigorexia\". \nIn fact, other research in the UK has found that 38 per cent of men would trade a year of their life for that perfect, Greek god body; a higher percentage than women who'd do the same for their ideal figure. \nThe problem is, men don't talk about their body image insecurities. We don't hear it from male celebrities or sports starts and it's never banter at the bar. It's something we hide from our peers and quietly address alone in the mirror. \nWhether you're plagued by excess kilos or a lack thereof, we Kiwi men should start talking to each other about what all this Thor-like pressure is doing to us. The only thing we have to lose is this farcical idea that we really can achieve something built in a CGI effects studio. - Sunday Magazine", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T14:18:43.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
