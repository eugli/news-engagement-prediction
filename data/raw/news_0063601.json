Fidel V. Ramos with former Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile at the Palace-led commemoration of the Edsa People Power revolution. LEILA SALAVERRIA/INQUIRER.net \nFormer President Fidel Ramos nearly skipped the palace-led, toned-down commemoration of the Edsa People Power revolution when he learned that it would be held in Camp Aguinaldo, away from ordinary people, he disclosed today. \nRamos, who eventually decided to join the event, said the organizers had pleaded with him to show up. \nBut he expects next year’s Edsa event to be “very, very big” and “bongga” (grand). ADVERTISEMENT \nThis is because by next year, he said, the government and private sector should have put up a 2.3 to 2.5 hectare area behind the People Power Monument to house a museum and library for people power memorabilia and artifacts. \nRamos was one of the key Edsa figures who joined the Malacañang commemoration, which President Rodrigo Duterte himself skipped. \nDuterte was represented at the event by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea. \nFormer President Benigno Aquino III, whose family figured prominently in the fight against the Marcos regime, was invited to the event but did not show up. \nAmong those present at the Camp Aguinaldo event were former Senator Juan Ponce Enrile and former Vice President Jejomar Binay.
