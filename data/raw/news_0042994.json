I didn’t think anything of it at the time, but [the driver] put the bags in front of the meter,” she said. \n“Rookie error, I know now. \n“We were going in the right direction, so we weren’t too worried, but then when we got to our stop he asked for a ton of money. \n“He wanted about US$200. \n“I said that was insane, and it should have been less than US$50.” \nMrs Walker, who studies engineering at Swinburne University of Technology, said as the argument progressed, the driver’s anger boiled over. \nWhen he started threatening the group, it became clear they had to escape. Suzanne Walker, right, refused to pay when a taxi driver tried to scam her.

We started running, and we jumped out of the way. \n“He swerved to try and hit us. We ran down the street into a one-way road where our hotel was, and we thought he couldn’t get us, but he decided to chase us. He just threw the taxi into reverse, and swerved toward us again.” \nThe man who had yelled at them to get out of the cab worked at a nearby hotel, and he offered to let the girls take refuge inside. \n“We were so scared we agreed. We hid in the lobby, behind the concierge desk. After we walked in, I realised how dangerous it could have been. \n“The taxi driver was driving backwards and forwards outside trying to find us. We hid in there for almost half an hour until the taxi gave up.” \nAccording to the Australian Government’s Smartraveller website, woman face greater risks than men — even if they’re experienced travellers. \nThe official advice is to have accommodation organised, use only a reputable taxi, travel with a companion where possible, and draw attention to yourself by shouting or making a scene if you ever feel uncomfortable or in danger. Mrs Walker is an experienced traveller, who did everything by the book. Picture: Suzanne Walker Source: Supplied Travel agent Rosie Richardson said flyers who have just arrived are “fresh meat”.

They checked in safely, and enjoyed the remainder of their 16-day trip. \nVietnam has long been a favourite with Australian travellers, to the point where Air Asia today launched a sale offering flights for just $129 , from a number of cities. \nRosie Richardson, director at Mosaic Travel, said the ride between the airport and the hotel is the place travellers are most likely to be scammed, however, stories like this shouldn’t stop women from travelling overseas and having a good time. \n“You’re exhausted, bamboozled and overwhelmed. You’re a scammer’s delight, you’re fresh meat, and the best way to avoid that is to get your travel agent or hotel to arrange a transfer, which is often cheaper than a taxi and prepaid,” she told news.com.au. \n“For taxis, what I always suggest — especially for women — is to ask for the fare costs upfront, or make sure the metre is running. Also, make sure you have small change so you can give the driver the exact money.” \nHowever, she said travellers should take care not to be too closed off and suspicious, as some of the best experiences come from unexpected encounters. \n“Last year in Turkey, I had an older taxi driver, and I ended up going to his house for dinner, and then he drove me home. If I’d been closed-minded, it wouldn’t have happened. It’s a fine line, and you have to make that judgment call.” \nShe said the key is to always trust your gut.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T08:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:12:14.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
