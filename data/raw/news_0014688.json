The move was not unexpected, and the DEA’s notice said the revocation was a consequence of the state license suspension, which blocked the doctor from practicing medicine or prescribing medication in Colorado, and not the result of new information.\nRelated Articles August 17, 2016 Suspensions re-instated for Colorado doctors who recommended high medical marijuana plant counts July 22, 2016 Judge temporarily blocks Colorado medical marijuana doctors’ suspensions July 19, 2016 Four Colorado doctors suspended over medical marijuana recommendations Late last month, the DEA published a similar notice for Dunlop. Searches of the Federal Register for notices relating to the other suspended doctors turned up nothing.\nFour of the suspended doctors — everyone but Dean — filed suit over the suspensions last year. After winning a brief reprieve , a judge in Denver allowed the suspensions to continue while the doctors’ administrative appeals progressed. The doctors appealed the judge’s order; meanwhile, their cases at the Medical Board are also still pending. Lee Rasizer, a spokesman for the state agency that houses the Medical Board, said he could not comment on the cases.\nThe doctors were each accused of recommending that hundreds of patients be allowed to grow or possess more than the standard six marijuana plants per patient. The doctors say their suspensions were arbitrary, and that all of their recommendations conformed to the law and policy.", "external_links": ["https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/25/2017-01690/gentry-reeves-dunlop-md-decision-and-order", "http://www.dora.state.co.us/pls/real/DDMS_Public.Display_Document?p_section=DPO&p_doc_id=433896&p_source=ROD&p_doc_key=81C09FD0D887EB550507D3AC6C916E41", "http://www.dora.state.co.us/pls/real/DDMS_Public.Display_Document?p_section=DPO&p_doc_id=433895&p_source=ROD&p_doc_key=FCD40C2DC775C7F314C313F75E286592", "http://www.dora.state.co.us/pls/real/DDMS_Public.Display_Document?p_section=DPO&p_doc_id=433892&p_source=ROD&p_doc_key=62EB081D9BF90AC8EA0AADABB6C32262", "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/02/03/2017-02321/janet-carol-dean-md-decision-and-order", "https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/take5dora/news/dora-summarily-suspends-physician-janet-dean", "http://www.dora.state.co.us/pls/real/DDMS_Public.Display_Document?p_section=DPO&p_doc_id=433893&p_source=ROD&p_doc_key=B490E7ED081D221C348FE69E95965466", "https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/dora/DORA-summarily-suspends-four-physicians-medical-marijuana", "http://www.dora.state.co.us/pls/real/DDMS_Public.Display_Document?p_section=DPO&p_doc_id=441155&p_source=ROD&p_doc_key=2952665D7A0E6787E3BA6CBACDDA7513"], "published": "2017-02-07T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:07:46.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
