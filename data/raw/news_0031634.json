Because of the political climate, people are worried,” said Salam. “Sometimes green card holders… they’ve been here for a long time, and they’re procrastinating the process to become citizens. But now there is a sense of urgency.” \nSalam said she hates for fear to be the motivating factor, but she’s encouraged by the spike in interest in legal citizenship. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
