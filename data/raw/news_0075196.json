Amidst all that a Kargil Martyr’s daughter, Gurmehar Kaur, posted a picture of hers holding a placard saying that Pakistan didn’t kill her father, the War did. The pic went very viral, and she found a lot of supporters and haters equally. While her supporters lauded her for her stance, the haters took her down from bringing her martyred father in as part of the protests. \nHowever, it was Virender Sehwag ‘s tweet that took the cake. The former Indian batsman is now more popular for his social networking activity on Twitter, where he mostly trolls his friends and opponents. Some of his tweets also show his love for a certain ruling party. So when this girl’s tweet and pic went viral, Sehwag decided to have some fun of his own, as he posted a pic of his own with a caption that mentions that he never hit triple centuries, his bat did. Check it out for yourself… \n— Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) February 26, 2017 \nRandeep Hooda, who is a good friend of Sehwag, found Sehwag’s troll funny and appreciated it on Twitter… \n— Randeep Hooda (@RandeepHooda) February 26, 2017 \nSince then, the duo have sparked off a war of sorts on Twitter, with Gurmehar Kaur’s supporters blasting them for their ‘insensitive’ tweets, while their fans taking on the opposite side brutally. Kaur had also claimed that she had even been getting ‘rape’ threats from some of their fans. She spoke to NDTV about this, “I have been getting a lot of threats on social media. I think it is very scary when people threaten you with violence or with rape.” \nRandeep Hooda had later clarified his stance on his Facebook page with a long post, saying that he didn’t mean to insult the girl, but just found Sehwag’s post funny. He insisted on his right of free speech, saying that everyone can express their opinion in democracy, and that media shouldn’t make it such a big issue. Here’s his post… \nSo what do you make of the whole issue? \nPublished: February 27, 2017 10:55 pm Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T19:37:05.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
