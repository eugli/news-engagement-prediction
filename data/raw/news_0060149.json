(Supplied: Australian Antarctic Division) \nThey have discovered that the crustaceans' eyestalks have tiny band markings that correspond with each year of the animal's life, much like the growth rings found in trees. \nRob King, krill biologist at the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) in Tasmania, said understanding the age of krill was critical. \n\"As pressures mount on the krill population we need to be able to understand whether there's enough young krill coming through, and enough older krill to produce new recruits,\" he said. \nTo test the validity of the growth bands, AAD scientists hatched and grew krill in their research aquarium in Kingston, south of Hobart. \nThe same process was undertaken in Japan, but the krill were kept at a different water temperature. \nThose \"control\" krill were then compared to wild krill from Antarctica, which meant researchers could be certain that each growth band equalled a year of life.
