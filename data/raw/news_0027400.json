Since her image-tainting split from Grey’s Anatomy , this undeniable talent has struggled to reignite her flickering star. After fizzling two years ago with NBC’s State of Affairs , Heigl reboots again with Doubt , a legal drama that aspires to be as breezy and buzzy as The Good Wife but can’t match its pop . She plays sharp, brash attorney Sadie Ellis, who, with her college BFF Albert (Dulé Hill), works for a boutique firm run by her father (Elliott Gould), a legend who made his name defending ’60s activists. She’s got a high-drama backstory — her mom (Judith Light) has been in jail for most Sadie’s life — and high-drama romance: She’s falling for her chief client, Billy (Steven Pasquale), a celebrated child surgeon accused of murder. Is he innocent like he claims or is he conning everyone? \nDoubt finds its melodrama at the intersections of law and grace, principles and desire. The themes are there, but the inspired execution isn’t. Billy’s just-okay mystery — reminiscent of ’80s gaslight thrillers like Jagged Edge — unspools with just-okay twists. The case-of-the-week tales are grabby — is it rape when a husband sleeps with a wife with Alzheimer’s? — but often lack depth and veer sentimental. The performances are likable without being interesting, with Laverne Cox being the standout as a transgender woman in the bloom of personal and professional growth. Heigl can play all of Sadie’s tones, except stupidity. You don’t buy her boundary-crossing romance with Billy, because Heigl and the writing can’t you make you believe she’d ever be flawed enough to do that. You simply don’t doubt her enough for Doubt to work as well as it should. C+ \nDoubt debuts Wednesday, Feb. 15 at 10 p.m. ET on CBS.
