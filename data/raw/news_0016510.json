Food was being delivered to them. \nREAD MORE: \nHospital staff were visiting the students on campus. \nClasses had been cancelled for at least the next two weeks, Rush said. \n\"Students have been asked not spend time in big groups. \n\"All on-campus students and staff have been asked to provide proof that they have been immunised for measles, mumps and rubella. \n\"Until proof is provided, they have been asked to stay on campus.\" Ad Feedback \nMeanwhile all off-campus students and staff had been asked to stay away and limit their exposure to others, until they had provided proof of immunisation. \n\"Those that cannot provide proof of immunisation will be provided the opportunity for immunisation on campus this week.\" \nThe institute would largely be shut following the outbreak, with the dining hall, library, and recreation centre closed until further notice. \nStudents could contact the IPU student support 24/7 phone for any assistance, Rush said. \nMedical Officer of Health Dr Greg Simmons said MidCentral Public Health Service was working closely with the organisation, which was following all recommendations. \n\"Public Health will continue to work with the institute to provide assistance and trace the contacts of the confirmed cases.\" \nSimmons said measles was a very infectious disease and anyone who was not immune was at risk if they came into contact with the disease. \n\"It spreads from person to person through the air from breathing, coughing and sneezing, and contact with those secretions. \n\"The disease is contagious from just before symptoms begin until about five days after onset of the rash. The illness usually starts between 10 and 14 days after contact with the measles virus.\" \nMeasles symptoms include: fever, runny nose, cough, and sore red eyes. \nAfter 3-5 days a rash appears on the head and spreads down the body. \nSimmons said these cases were a reminder that measles can occur at any time. \n\"Vaccination is the best way for people to protect themselves against measles and is free to those who need it. You can protect both yourself and the community by getting vaccinated. \n\"Anyone who thinks they may have measles should stay away from work, school or public places. \n\"If you think you might have measles, you should contact your GP – by phone first – or Healthline on 0800 611 116 for more advice. \n\"It is very important you tell your GP that you think you might have measles before going into the surgery.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:34:20.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
