Per BBC Sport , Vidal is set to miss up to five months of action having recently dislocated his ankle against Alaves, leaving Sergi Roberto—traditionally a central midfielder—as the only player in the Barca squad comfortable in the right-back role. According to Mundo Deportivo (via Calciomercato ), Barca \" have been granted special dispensation to sign a player on a short-term agreement,\" and Juanfran, 28, is viewed as the prime target. The report added the Spaniard has a £6.8 million release clause and Barca could even sign him up as a long-term replacement for Dani Alves, as neither Vidal nor Roberto have nailed down the right-back role this season. Juanfran is currently on loan at Depor from Watford and has enjoyed an impressive 2016-17, providing four assists in 19 La Liga matches, per WhoScored.com . Aitor Alcalde Colomer/Getty Images Sport also named Juanfran as a potential right-back acquisition for Barca, as well as Venezuelan Rosales, 28, saying the Catalans have been in contact with both but will not make a decision on whether to make a signing until they establish their own title credentials following Sunday's clash with Atletico Madrid . Meanwhile, 25-year-old Portuguese Cedric was reported as a Barca target by the Telegraph 's Matt Law , but it would take a bid of at least £15 million to persuade Saints into selling. All three of Juanfran, Rosales and Cedric could potentially fit well into the Barca side. They are all attacking full-backs with fine delivery—Cedric is particularly accomplished in that regard, per WhoScored—and could even compete for a first-team spot in manager Luis Enrique's side with Vidal fit: WhoScored.com @WhoScored Cédric Soares: Has completed more crosses (59) than any other player in the last 2 Premier League seasons (excl. corners) #saintsfc https://t.co/al0BwAmR2z 2/20/2017, 4:02:45 PM Alves' departure to Juventus last summer provided Barca with a right-back issue they had not been concerned with for the duration of the Brazilian's eight-year stay at the club. With Roberto's preferred position in the middle of the park and Vidal having only recently earned Enrique's confidence as the starting right-back, a search was reportedly already ongoing to strengthen the position, per Law. And they now look to have identified three candidates who could potentially fill the void.
