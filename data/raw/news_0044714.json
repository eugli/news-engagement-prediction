That's because the devices have faster modems that can transfer data at unprecedented download speeds.\nThe top modem providers are Intel and Qualcomm, whose cellular chips are used in the iPhone. On Tuesday they both announced modems that will push LTE connections to speeds well over those of regular home internet connections.\nQualcomm unveiled the X20 LTE chipset, which can transfer data at speeds of up to 1.2Gbps. Intel announced the XMM 7560 LTE modem, which can download data at speeds of up to 1Gbps.\nHowever, cellular networks aren't yet designed to handle such fast speeds. One exception is Telstra, an Australian telecommunications company, which has launched a gigabit LTE service for commercial use in that country.\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:14:40.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
