Also, I needed to be sure that the letter did not get missing at the national assembly like the 2016 budget, new items smuggled into it or it gets padded on transit.” \nAccording to a statement issued on Wednesday by his Special Assistant on Public Communications and New Media, Lere Olayinka, Governor Fayose said; “Even though the name was forwarded by the Acting President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, the Acting President couldn’t have done that without the concurrence of President Buhari even though he is resting in the United Kingdom.” \nWhile calling on the Senate not to waste time in confirming Justice Onnoghen as substantive CJN, Governor Fayose appealed to the new CJN to always bear it in his mind that there is another judgement in heaven and ensure that the judiciary under him dispense justice to Nigerians without fear or favour. \nHe said the judiciary, under Justice Onnoghen should help in sustaining democracy by resisting the plot by the All Progressives Congress (APC) led federal government to turn Nigeria to a one-party state. \n“Opposition is one of the major ingredients of democracy and any attempt to kill opposition will spell doom democracy in the country. \nThe judiciary must therefore resist the APC sinister plot to deny Nigerians their fundamental rights to freedom of association and expression. \n“Justice Onnoghen should strive to uphold a judiciary that will be seen by all Nigerians as their last hope in practice and indeed,” the governor said. \nSpeaking further, the governor called for full enquiry into petitions against Justice Okon Abang, whom he maintained was “a cancer that is capable of destroying the entire judiciary in Nigeria if nothing is done to curb his excesses.” \nHe said a judge like Abang who was described by the Court of Appeal as giving fraudulent judgments, speaking from both sides of his mouth and acting like Father Christmas should not be allowed any space in the judiciary. \n“Therefore, I insist that the CJN should wade into Justice Abang’s fraudulent judgments with a view to showing him the way out of the bench so that our judiciary can redeem its image,” Governor Fayose said. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:45:29.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
