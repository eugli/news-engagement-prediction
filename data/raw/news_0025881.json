Facebook By Braelyn Wood Feb 13, 2017 18-year-old freshman Erica Buschick was found dead in her college dorm room Ohio's Miami University on January 20, following a night of binge drinking. The Miami University Police Department has since released a 25-page report last week outlining the details of tragic night and, while an official toxicology report has not been released, suggests \"high-risk alcohol consumption\" took place according to The Daily Mail.

A friend then picked Buschick and Graves up and drove them to an off-campus party according to The Miami Student, the university's student paper. There, the friends knowingly drank cheap vodka disguised in a Grey Goose bottle before heading out to local campus hangout Brick Street Bar Uptown at around 11:30 p.m. By this point, Buschick was too intoxicated to enter the establishment, and Graves called a taxi to take them home. The taxi driver helped Graves take Buschick back to their room after she fell and scraped her knee and face trying to exit the car. Worried that Buschick might fall again, the driver laid the teenager down on her side on a bean bag in her dorm room. Graves took a photo of her passed out friend and posted it on Instagram before falling asleep herself (the post was later deleted by police). She told police officers she woke at 3 a.m. to see Buschick still on the beanbag before passing out again. When she woke again at 9 a.m. to see that Buschick hadn't moved, and was cold to the touch, she called 911.

Miami University's president Gregory Crawford has released a statement concerning Buschick’s \"devastating\" death, confirming that university leadership would be completing a \"holistic assessment\" of the schools efforts to stop bring drinking behaviors. “High-risk alcohol consumption among college students is of concern to every university president,\" Crawford wrote, \"I am determined and committed to doing all that we can to help ensure the well-being of all of our students.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T15:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:01:56.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
