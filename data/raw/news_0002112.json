Forces are now preparing to enter the outpost's synagogue, where dozens of residents have barricaded themselves and refuse to be evacuated. According to reports at the scene, the residents have locked down the synagogue and blocked off its entrance. Police forces attempted to negotiate with the residents overnight and convince them to willingly leave the synagogue, to no avail. IN PICTURES: The tumultuous eviction of the Amona outpost Once police finish evacuating the synagogue, the evacuation of the settlement will be considered complete. Border police forces are expected to stay in the outpost in order to prevent the theft of remaining property that belongs to residents who have already been evacuated and whose new residences have yet to be decided. The vast majority of the outpost's settlements have moved temporarily to the nearby village of Ofra. In the clashes that took place throughout the evacuation, 24 police officers were reportedly injured. Since the beginning of the evacuation, which started at 6 a.m. on Wednesday, 13 teenagers were arrested by police for disorderly conduct, assaulting police officers and obstructing policemen from carrying out their duties. Some 400 young men and women who came to the settlement in order to support the residents in their resistance of the evacuation were removed from Amona by security forces as well. The Israeli government was ordered by the High Court of Justice to evacuate the outpost, after the court ruled that the settlements' houses were built on privately-owned Palestinian land. The government attempted to evacuate the outpost several times, and was finally able to arrive at an agreement with Amona's residents, according to which some of the houses were supposed to be removed to another part of the mountain where Amona is situated and the residents will comply with the evacuation. (Israeli forces begin evacuating Amona) Legal difficulties stood in the way of implementing this agreement, and the clashes between the outpost's residents and the government quickly ensued, forcing the government to order a forceful evacuation of the outpost. Police forces, backed by the IDF, prepared in advance for the evacuation and reportedly predicted that it will last a long time and could easily develop into a violent altercation with residents who would refuse to be willingly evacuated.
