Trump speaks during a forum with business leaders, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, USA, 03 February 2017. (EPA) Apple, Google, Facebook, Uber, eBay and Netflix are among the dozens of tech companies who have joined the fight against Donald trump's travel ban. Source: Tweet \nDozens of tech companies including behemoths Apple, Google and Facebook are siding with Washington state and Minnesota to fight Donald Trump's refugee and traveller ban. \nThe companies filed briefs late on Sunday with a federal appellate court saying the Trump executive order hurts their businesses. \nIn their court filing with the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, a total of 97 companies said Trump's travel ban \"hinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent; increases costs imposed on business; makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace.\" \nThe travel ban would prompt businesses to build operations outside the United States, said the companies. \nThe long list of enterprises looking to join the fight against Trump are among the country's biggest, most high-profile businesses like Uber, eBay and Netflix. \nThe businesses are looking to help Washington and Minnesota as they sue Trump. Related The legal challenges lining up to stop Trump's immigration order The legal challenges to US President Donald Trump's contentious immigration order are mounting with several US states filing lawsuits against the executive order. \nThe states have said the ban harmed residents and effectively mandated discrimination. \nThe 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals this weekend denied the administration's request to immediately set aside a Seattle judge's ruling that put a hold on the ban nationwide. \nTrump's order applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen - countries the administration said raise terrorism concerns. \nThe order sparked nationwide airport protests and caused confusion for many foreigners trying to reach the United States. Related US court rejects immediate overturn of halt of Trump travel ban US federal appeals court rejects a request by the Department of Justice to immediately reinstate President Donald Trump's travel ban. \nTrump has said he's trying to protect Americans. The government says the president has the authority to decide who can enter the country. \nHowever the companies, in their court filing, said Trump's executive order would destroy the entrepreneurial spirit that fuels American businesses.
