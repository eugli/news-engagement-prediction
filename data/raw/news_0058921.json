Story Continued Below \n“In regard to us two, I think the biggest misconception is everything that you’re reading. We share an office suite together. We’re basically together from 6:30 in the morning until 11:00 o’clock at night,” Priebus said. “Let's not kid ourselves — I can talk about data and ground game and Steve can talk about big ideas, but the truth of the matter is, Donald Trump, President Trump, brought together the party and the conservative movement. And I've got to tell you, if the party and conservative movement are together, similar to Steve and I, it can't be stopped.” \nPriebus, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, was widely seen as the face of the GOP establishment that was largely reluctant to embrace Trump’s brand of bombastic rhetoric and economic populism. Bannon, who joined Trump’s campaign in mid-August and helped steer it to a surprise victory last November, was the head of Breitbart News, a media outlet popular among the alt-right, a loose group of political ideologies with ties to white nationalism whose supporters are among Trump’s most fervent backers. By Tara Palmeri \nThat Priebus became chief of staff was initially seen as an indication that Trump’s White House might lean toward more traditional Republicanism and away from Bannon’s upset-the-apple-cart approach. But the president has kept up much of the hard-line rhetoric that created controversy for him but also helped generate the massive crowds that propelled him to victory. \nAlmost from the moment their jobs were announced, reports have swirled that the two men have butted heads and styles as White House aides jockey for position and power in the West Wing. Bannon said such characterizations could not be further from the truth and pointed to the media’s swing-and-miss on Trump’s victory as evidence that it has little credibility. \n“If you look at the opposition party and how they portray the campaign, how they portrayed the transition, and how they are portraying the administration, it's always wrong,” Bannon said. “Just like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the campaign and just like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the transition, they are absolutely dead wrong about what’s going on today.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:09:16.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
