It will be directed by Emmy winner (and Simmons' former 30 for 30 colleague) Jason Hehir. So happy to team up with @hbo and @wwe and Jason Hehir to make my dream sports documentary project - ANDRE THE GIANT. It's happening. pic.twitter.com/VCGmo3iHOz \n— Bill Simmons (@BillSimmons) February 13, 2017 \nBorn André Roussimoff, the seven-foot-four wrestler ultimately suffered from a rare disorder known as acromegaly due to his gigantism, which led to his untimely death at 46. \nIn a statement , Simmons' admiration for André is apparent: \"Going back to 2007 and 2008 when I was creating and developing 30 for 30 for ESPN, André's story rode the top of every single sports documentary wish list I ever made. We always hear about unicorns these days—André was the ultimate unicorn. He’s a true legend. Everyone who ever crossed paths with him has an André story—and usually four or five.” \nSimmons isn't kidding about the stories. While André's history in the WWE (including a now-iconic fight against Hulk Hogan at Wrestlemania III) is well-documented, André was also infamous for causing chaos outside of the ring, often with alcohol involved. His Princess Bride co-star Cary Elwes has often recounted that André racked up a $40,000 bar tab while filming. \nHBO has yet to announce a release date.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T16:25:54.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
