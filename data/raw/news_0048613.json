If he looks at the top English strikers we’ve had, and the top man Alan Shearer in particular – Kane is still so far off him at the moment. \n“He hasn’t got an ounce of nastiness in him, which he needs. You need a little bit of that if you’re going to be absolutely at the very top and be regarded as one of the top strikers. You need that nastiness.\" Shearer celebrating one of many goals for Newcastle (Photo: Getty) Is Kane nasty enough? (Photo: PA) \nKane's treble at Craven Cottage ended Spurs' goalscoring struggles from open play, with Pochettino's men having gone without for over 350 minutes. \nKane struggled to have an impact in last week's back-to-back defeats to Liverpool and Gent, and the lack of 'edge' is an argument that was often thrown his way during his younger days, when struggling to make an impact during loan spells at Norwich and Leicester. \nStill Ashton believes there is plenty of scope for improvement.

[But] there have been a few games where he hasn’t been involved enough, and that’s where he can improve. \n“Be more of a nuisance, make more of certain balls, be more aggressive when he’s in the box and score more headers. \n\"We’re talking about a really great striker already, but I just think there’s so much more he can improve on.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:23:24.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
