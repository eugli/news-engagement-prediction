External Link: Map: Birdsville, QLD \n\"Normally there's people coming back and forth but [during summer] we don't want people going out there,\" said Senior Constable Pursell. \n\"Cars have aircons and people have mini fridges, but if something goes wrong … the heat's too extreme. You won't survive out there.\" \nMr Fullagar came to Birdsville from coastal New South Wales about four years ago, intending to stay temporarily for work at the hotel and then move on. \n\"It's a really nice community out here,\" he said. \n\"I only ever intended to stay for three months, but after my six weeks I just thought, 'this is brilliant'. \n\"I really loved it and now I'm running the hotel.\" \nThe heat has not been a deterrent for Mr Fullagar, who even managed to fit in mowing the lawns this morning — through 41C heat — without breaking a sweat. \nHe said he now found the 40-plus temperatures in Birdsville easier to deal with than the \"sticky feeling\" humidity on the east coast. \n\"My first summer was difficult, I must admit, but you just get used to it,\" he said. \n\"Now if I go to Brisbane and it's only 34 degrees and humid I feel very uncomfortable. \n\"It's very hot [in Birdsville], you can feel the sun really heating up your skin, but you don't have that sticky, clammy, uncomfortable feeling you do in humidity.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T07:05:30.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
