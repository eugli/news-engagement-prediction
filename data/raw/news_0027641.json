(rtd) who delivered the historic judgment of the Court of Appeal which confirmed the illegality of police permit is a member of the Nigeria Police Service Commission. We have no doubt that the respected Justice will rightly advise the Nigeria Police Force to stop the illegal practice of insisting on the issuance of police permit for political meetings and rallies in Nigeria. \nIn particular, the attention of the Court was not drawn to the case of Attorney-General of Anambra State v. Attorney-General of the Federation . 3 where Uwais CJN (as he then was) had held that “The Constitution in section 215 subsection (1) clearly gives the Governor of Anambra State the power to issue lawful direction to the Commissioner of Police, Anambra State, in connection with securing public safety and order in the State. ” \nIn the circumstance, the Court of Appeal correctly jettisoned its decision in Chukwuma v Commissioner of Police (supra) and affirmed the judgment of the Federal High Court on the illegality of police permit. \nProtest Against Government are not treasonable: In a special broadcast on the eve of the industrial action and public protests President Goodluck Jonathan conceded the right of Nigerians to kick against the painful economic programme of subsidy removal. \nMonitor the strikes and the protests \nBoth the Attorney-General of the Federation and the Inspector-General of Police also conceded that Nigerians were constitutionally entitled to protest peacefully against official policies. \nNotwithstanding such official pronouncements armed police personnel detailed to monitor the strikes and the protests opened fire and killed unarmed protesters in Ilorin, Kano and Lagos. Embarrassed by the incident the Police Commissioner, Mr. Kasali ordered the arrest of the trigger happy cop, apologized to the parents of the deceased and promised to prosecute the suspect as there was no basis for his action since the protests in Lagos were peaceful. \nHowever, despite the fact that over 2 million demonstrators in the streets of Lagos conducted themselves peacefully armed soldiers were deployed in a desperate bid to suppress the protests on the orders of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Dr. President Goodluck Jonathan. \nAs there was no insurrection to be contained by the army as envisaged by section 217(2)(c) of the Constitution the deployment of the armed troops was roundly condemned by Nigerians. Instead of protesting the usurpation of the constitutional duties of the police by the armed forces the Inspector General of Police addressed a press conference in Abuja wherein he justified the deployment and threatened to charge demonstrators with treasonable felony. The spokesperson for the State Security Service, Mrs. Mary Ogan also accused some leaders of the civil society for making inciting statements which could provoke terrorism! \nThe right to protest: Since Nigeria is under a democratic dispensation it is germane to join issues with an elected regime that is bent on imposing fascism on the country. More so, that Nigerians fought and defeated murderous military juntas to pave way for the restoration of civil rule. \nHence, when a cabal of power mongers attempted to plunge the nation into crisis following the ill health of the Late President Umaru Yar’Adua in November 2009 civil society groups staged peaceful protests in Lagos and Abuja. \nIt was those protests that culminated in the emergence of Dr. Goodluck Jonathan as the Acting President of the Republic. Ironically, when the Police Authorities asked for police permit for the demonstrations I reminded the Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Onovo of the case of Inspector-General of Police. V. All Nigeria Peoples Party (supra) wherein the Court of Appeal had declared that the requirement of police permit for public protests was illegal and unconstitutional. \nIllegality of demolition of houses \nSometime in 1989 about 300,000 people were rendered homeless in Maroko, a shanty town in Victoria Island in Lagos State where their houses were demolished by the defunct military junta. All efforts by the displaced people of Maroko to halt the demolition exercise failed on the ground that a breach of the fundamental right to property could not be enforced under the Fundamental Rights Enforcement Procedure Rules, 1979. Upon the appropriation of Maroko it was sand filled with public funds and distributed by the government to some top civil servants, military officers and the business elite. Even though the Court of Appeal later held that the refusal of the high court to grant the relief sought by the displaced community was wrong the ruling military junta arrogantly named one of the streets after the judge who had refused the injunction! \nHowever, following the destruction of their homes by the Lagos state government the Maroko people took over the uncompleted Abesan estate. \nTo prevent the government from ejecting them forcefully from the estate we approached the Lagos High Court for legal protection. In its stiff opposition to the suit the government contented that since the occupants of the estate were squatters they could be ejected forcefully. \nIn rejecting the spurious contention, the presiding judge, Alabi J. (as he then was) ruled that the occupiers of the estate were entitled to be served a 7-day quit notice and be sued if they refused to quit the premises. \nNotwithstanding the clear provisions of the law enunciated by the Lagos High Court in Ayeyemi’s case the Lagos state government has continued to embark on mass demolition of houses occupied by the poor in the state. It is our submission that all the demolition exercises carried out so far are illegal as they violate section 36(4) of the Constitution which stipulates that in the determination of their rights and obligations every citizen shall be entitled to make a representation to the authority. It is pertinent to note that the right of owners or occupiers of houses to make representation to the government before any demolition exercise is carried out is enshrined in the Lagos State Urban and Regional Planning and Development Law Cap U2 Laws of Lagos state 2015 (herein referred to as the URPD law). \nThus, by virtue of section 49 of the URPD law there shall be a Renewal Agency which shall be saddled with the responsibility to issue enforcement notices including the following: \n(a) Contravention Notice;", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:28:08.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
