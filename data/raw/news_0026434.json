But one thing haters and fans can (probably) agree on is that the film’s visual effects team is impressive as hell. This week, director Zack Snyder shared a video that revealed some of the jaw-dropping work they did on the mega-budgeted blockbuster, and be warned: some of it might melt your brain. \nI’ve seen these sorts of VFX clip reels before, but they often tend to concentrate on only a handful of giant action set pieces. But since BVS is packed with those kinds of scenes, this video is more than eleven minutes long, pulling back the curtain on how some of the movie’s most iconic sequences were made. It’s a fascinating look at one of last year’s most talked-about films, and this video is so cool that even those who might have despised the final product can still shake their heads in wonder at the extraordinary effort that went into it. \nWe’ll see these characters again when Zack Snyder’s arrives in theaters on November 17, 2017. \nImage: Warner Bros.
