By Bill Bradley \n‚Äú Jeopardy !‚Äù just had its most hostile contestant since Sean Connery appeared on the ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù version. \nDuring a ‚ÄúJeopardy‚Äù College Championship match that aired Tuesday, host Alex Trebek thought he was asking contestant Viraj Mehta a simple question about pizza. \nThis prompt would allow the Stanford student to launch into a hilarious anecdote, amusing the host and America. \nBut the joke was on us ... Not realizing he's giving us all the finger @Jeopardy pic.twitter.com/lKPm51sF71 \nWhat is ... he doing with that finger? \nIt didn‚Äôt take long for Twitter to catch on. Holy crap this dude on Jeopardy just gave America the finger for a solid 7-10 seconds pic.twitter.com/ilElMdyGrQ ‚Äî Jackie Treehorn (@BeerMeABeer) February 22, 2017 Well play Stanford.

If it‚Äôs not intentional, that guy is just asking for a finger cramp for no reason.
