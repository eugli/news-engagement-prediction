Mother now wary of out-of-school care \nOne of the mothers whose child was involved in the case said outside court she was pleased Dickson had been jailed, but was upset at handling of the matter by the school involved and the education department. \n\"How was this man allowed to be the only carer on site at any one time?\" she said. \nShe said she would never again put her children in an out-of-school-hours care program. \n\"Myself, as a mother, trusted Brenton for six years — not only was he grooming children at the school, he was grooming mothers like me,\" she said. \nIn a statement, a spokesman for the Department for Education and Child Development said the \"school community was notified by letter of the initial allegations and again at each appropriate point of the legal proceedings\". \n\"This included a letter when charges were laid, when court proceedings commenced and when the conviction was recorded,\" the statement said. \n\"All victims were referred to the Child Protection Service which is the lead agency in relation to supporting victims of child abuse.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:30:21.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
