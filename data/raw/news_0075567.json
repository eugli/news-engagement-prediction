Here's what she has to say Deepika Padukone, who attended the Golden Globes earlier this year, will be giving the Oscars a miss. IndiaToday.in | Written by Samrudhi Ghosh Deepika Padukone \nAll eyes are on Deepika Padukone 's achievements in the West. After her Hollywood debut, xXx: Return of Xander Cage, crossed the $300mn mark worldwide, fans were hoping that she would dazzle the Oscar red carpet. However, much to their disappointment, Deepika will be giving the Academy Awards a miss. \nDeepika told the media at a recently held event that she will not attend the Oscars; she was just happy that her film had been well received. \"For me, what was really heartening was the way India embraced the film. I think just the way everyone embraced my performance, even the way I spoke in the film, that makes me really happy,\" the actor said. \nDeepika attended the Golden Globes earlier this year and made a splash in her yellow off-shoulder gown. It's a pity that we will not see her slay it at the Oscars as well.
