Do these things sound... these mistakes... PIERS AKERMANTony, when youre dealing with millions of people, any individual who suffers is an obvious tragedy. And when I heard of this suicide, I think of the young men who were killed in the pink batts scheme. You know, that was another tragedy. How avoidable these things are when youre dealing with masses, is...I dont know. But, um... JULIAN BURNSIDEI think there is an answer to that. PIERS AKERMANAll I can say is there is absolute sympathy. And I agree with George, that I was at the Budget when Joe Hockey talked about lifters and leaners and so forth. TANYA PLIBERSEKAnd the end of the age of entitlement. PIERS AKERMANAnd I dont think theres a person in your audience here or in the suburbs tonight, Tony, who would believe that we dont need integrity in this system. The way its being done may need to be fine-tuned. Obviously, it is compellingly obvious that distress has been caused to a number of people. How many out of the millions who are involved, Im not really sure and the numbers are very imprecise. TONY JONESIm just going to quickly... GEORGE BRANDISCan I come back in? TONY JONESI will come back to you in one second. You wanted to make a point. JULIAN BURNSIDEYes. I think when a system of social support is being set up, you can either make it lean or you can make it slightly generous. Either way, problems will emerge. Make it too thin, some people will suffer. Make it too generous, some people will rort it. Thats inevitable. Until we manage to discover the difference between data and metadata we probably will not be able to escape that. TONY JONESGeorge Brandis. Sorry... JULIAN BURNSIDEWe need to decide as a matter of social policy that we would prefer to be generous and being taken advantage of on occasions than be mean and have catastrophic outcomes like weve just seen. TONY JONESGeorge Brandis, do you agree with that point? GEORGE BRANDISId like to make the point I was trying to make when I was cut off before. So, the system that is being attacked by Bill Shorten and by Tanya  and youre not just talking about individual cases, youre talking about the system  was a system that was introduced by you when you were Minister for Human Services and Bill Shorten when he was the Assistant Treasurer... TANYA PLIBERSEKHonestly, stop speaking nonsense. GEORGE BRANDIS..in 2011 during the Rudd-Gillard Government. Now, this system involves the review of potentially millions of transfer payments. So of course there will be mistakes made. And I agree with what Piers Akerman has said that when mistakes are made and they have terrible human consequences, then of course thats a tragedy. But we do have to have appropriate compliance measures. And the idea of data matching, introduced by Hawke, and the idea of automated letters being sent to people when there is a discrepancy evident from the data matching between the ATO data and the Centrelink data, that was introduced by you, is not a bad system. The methodology that has been used by this government is the same methodology that we inherited from you. So in relation... JULIAN BURNSIDEWhat should your system do when it becomes apparent from the questioner and from the thing we read about that mistakes are being made in data management... GEORGE BRANDISWell, let me tell you, Julian. JULIAN BURNSIDEWhat do you do if you cant blame it on the people who didnt design that system? TONY JONESTo both of you Ill just say this. Were running out of time on this issue. Weve got lots of questions. George, a quick summary. GEORGE BRANDISThe answer to Julians question is that when a notice is issued and it appears to the person to whom the notice is issued that a mistake has been made they can contact Centrelink and sort out the problem. TANYA PLIBERSEKThey can wait on the phone for a while. (LAUGHTER) If they can get an answer. TONY JONESIll just point out that Fred almost fell over laughing at that one. TANYA PLIBERSEKWhat is the average waiting time now, George? MICHELE LEVINEThis is about communications. This isnt about whether it was right or wrong. It may have been right or it may have been wrong but its really hard to believe that these letters were sent out, automated letters, without thinking about the kinds of people that were going to receive those letters. I got a sort of letter like that from the Tax Office. I was outraged. If my mother received a letter like that, she would be devastated. We all have to recognise that if the letter had been sent saying, Theres an inconsistency, were looking into this. It could have been framed in a way that people would go, if they were baddies, Uh, Ive been caught, and if they werent, they would go, Ah, theres a misunderstanding I need to sort out. It doesnt need to stop the whole system. TONY JONESIm going to have to move on. TANYA PLIBERSEKThe idea that you can just ring Centrelink and have a chat to them? How long did you wait on the phone last time you called Centrelink? GEORGE BRANDISOr you can visit your local Centrelink office. LYNDSEY JACKSONIt took me two weeks every day for 1.5 hours a day to make that call. TANYA PLIBERSEKI tell you, George, there is not a Centrelink... GEORGE BRANDISOr you can visit your local Centrelink office. TANYA PLIBERSEKSo theres no-one that lives in regional areas. TONY JONESGeorge, I think you were hearing from someone whos experienced the frustrations of trying to use that system. It might be a good idea to leave it there. (LAUGHTER) TONY JONESGEORGE BRANDISTony, I cant let Tanya escape with the point that she just made because its not an honest point. (GROANS AND LAUGHTER) GEORGE BRANDISWhen a discrepancy emerges and a letter is issued, then the person to whom the letter issues... And the letter is only issued where there is a discrepancy between the data that they have lodged with Centrelink and the data against which it is matched, can have a conversation with Centrelink in order to sort out the problem. How else would you suggest the problem be sorted? TONY JONESIm just saying that theres someone whos tried to deal with Centrelink and found it very difficult. But weve got to move on. TONY JONESRemember, if you hear any doubtful claims on Q&A, send a tweet using the hashtags #FactCheck and #QandA. And keep an eye on our Twitter account and The Conversation website for fact checks by the experts. Our next question comes from Antonella Sanderson. FAMILY COURT In my 18 years of working as a family lawyer Ive never seen the family law courts in such a state of crisis. Mums and dads can wait about three years in order to get a decision about how to divide their assets. Urgent cases about immediate care arrangements for children at risk of harm can sometimes need a wait of up to six months. There arent enough judges to get through the ever-increasing workload. There isnt enough counselling staff on hand at the courts and there certainly isnt enough funding for the supervised contact centres. Attorney-General, although you say the family law courts have their full complement of judges, it clearly isnt enough. Is it just that the government has decided there are no votes in family law so they dont have to bother about fixing this well-publicised resourcing crisis? TONY JONESGeorge, that is directed straight to you, so well go straight to you. But try and keep your answers brief if you can. I mean that for the whole panel. GEORGE BRANDISWell, there are 103 judges between the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court which is a practitioner in the field you know handles the lions share of family laws matter at the moment. There are two vacancies among the 103 which are about to be filled so the issue is the size of the courts. Now, I understand that the family law system is under pressure, but there is a finite complement of judges. The biggest reform that was introduced, not by this government, but by the previous Coalition government was, in fact, the introduction of what was then called the Federal Magistrates Court, now the Federal Circuit Court, about 85% of whose work is in the family law area, which has taken a lot of pressure off the Family Court of Australia. Um...that alone  and again, as a practitioner in the field, you would know  that the Federal Circuit Court disposes of family law matters with a lot less technicality and a lot more swiftly than the Family Court of Australia does. So now we have a system in which the day-to-day matters are dealt with by the Federal Circuit Court and the more complex matters and the appellate work is dealt with by the Family Court of Australia, so... TONY JONESGeorge, just to cut to a couple of points made by the questioner, three years for some mums and dads getting...waiting for decisions on dividing their assets, up to six months for urgent cases, six months wait for children at risk. So, I mean, thats whats being said in the question. Are you hearing this? GEORGE BRANDISThe management of courts is a matter for the head of jurisdiction, for the Chief Justice of the Family Court, the Chief Judge of the Federal Circuit Court and Im not gonna comment on individual cases. The point I make to you is, by introducing this more summary tier of jurisdiction, which was done by the Howard government, and by ensuring that it is well staffed, the government, in fact, has dealt with, or addressed, the most important aspect of the availability of judge time for litigants. JULIAN BURNSIDEYou could increase the number of judges in the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court in order the deal with an actual problem. I mean, people engaged in Family Court disputes, whether its over money or whether its over children, they are in an incredibly difficult emotional state. GEORGE BRANDISOf course they are. Of course they are. JULIAN BURNSIDEAnd it is not enough to say, Well, weve addressed the problem because weve created the Federal Circuit Court. The fact is a problem remains, and the questioner makes it very clear. Colleagues of mine who practise in family law agree that that is the sort of time frame people are looking at. Its just not working properly. GEORGE BRANDISWell, Julian, it would be nice to be able to do all of those things. It would be nice to be able to have more resources to create more judges but the Attorney-Generals Departments budget is limited and finite and we do the best we can with the resources that are available. TONY JONESLet me go to Piers. Theres been a longstanding, on the conservative side of politics, say, antagonism to the Family Law Act, as it was envisaged in the early days of the Whitlam government, right the way through to now, an antagonism towards the courts. Do you think theres been any neglect? PIERS AKERMANI think that the Family Court went way overboard under the former chief, Alastair Nicholson, Tony. Um...I think that, uh...the department is now looking at it and there are areas which are under review and I expect those results to be revealed fairly shortly. And I think theyre long overdue because the original structure set up by Whitlam clearly was not adequate for the pressures, and they are increasing. You only have to look at the numbers of family breakdowns across Australia and I think that is appalling. Um...and I hope that the review will identify the real pressure points and this thing can be resolved. It will never be resolved completely because of the nature of family disputes. But I think that the courts, uh... this review can show what needs to be done and should be done. TONY JONESTanya Plibersek... Im sorry. JULIAN BURNSIDEThe curious thing is in both of these topics, we have inadequate resources and therefore a failing system. Why do we have inadequate resources where youre after disability allowances... PIERS AKERMANYeah, but Julian... JULIAN BURNSIDE..and dealing with the real emotional problems that are dealt with in the Family Court system, and yet we seem to have tons of money to throw around locking up asylum seekers, huge defence budgets, all of that stuff. We throw money around... (APPLAUSE) PIERS AKERMANWell, hang on. Julian, actually... I mean, I know you have scant regard for the overall economy, but you have to... (JEERING) JULIAN BURNSIDEI pay a lot of tax, Piers. So do I. Uh, but you have to understand that the costs of asylum seekers have been considerably reduced with the closure of a lot of centres... JULIAN BURNSIDE17 out of 17, in fact. TONY JONESOK, were gonna come to the asylum seeker question... PIERS AKERMANThat was a good point, George, before Tony cut you off. JULIAN BURNSIDE17 out of 17. TONY JONESI am not trying to cut him off. Were coming to the asylum seeker question separately. Weve shifted off the Family Court, which is what were talking about. Tanya Plibersek. TANYA PLIBERSEKWell, I think its important to realise, as both George and Julian have indicated, that by the time people get to the Family Court, you have pretty much given up on the hope that things are gonna be mediated, that youre gonna get to a quick resolution, that theres a simple solution here. Its usually a very small minority of intractable cases that end up at the Family Court. They are, by definition, the most difficult. And, uh, I think, um...uh...what I would say is, um...my concern is, with the cuts to community legal centres and the cuts to Legal Aid in addition to the under-resourcing that youre describing, that these most difficult cases dont have people properly represented, that poor decisions can be made, decisions that arent in the best interests of children, and particularly where theres been family violence in a relationship. And people often ask the question, Why doesnt she leave? Um...I think we should be asking, Where would she go? with the cuts to homeless services for women and children who are fleeing domestic violence and, Who would help her leave? with the cuts weve seen to legal supports? GEORGE BRANDISWell, can I...? Im sorry, I have to correct what youve said, Tanya, because some of the claims youve just made are factually wrong. There will be cuts to community legal centres commencing on 30 June this year. Those cuts have not taken effect yet, but they will take effect on 30 June. Do you know why? Because the cabinet in which you sat at the time of the 2013 Budget decided that a four-year funding program would terminate... TANYA PLIBERSEKOh! Oh, George!
