Debra Saunders of the Las Vegas Review-Journal chimed in with a question about this Sunday’s Oscars/Academy Awards, and, well, it was interesting: “Sunday night, will the president be watching the Oscars? And if there is a Meryl Streep kind of moment, how do you think he will you think this happens?” \nSpicer was confused. “Why do i think what happens?” he said, to which she clarified by saying she meant anti-Trump political speeches on award shows. “I don’t know, it is a free country,” he said. “Hollywood is known for being rather far to the left in its opinions. I have to be honest with you. I think the president will be hosting the Governors Ball that night. Mrs. Trump looks forward to putting on a phenomenal event, and the first lady has put a lot of time into this event that’s going to occur welcoming our governors to the capital. I feel like that is where the president and first lady are going to be focused on Sunday night and so we will go from there.” \nAccording to Politico’s Shane Goldmacher , Trump aide Kellyanne Conway , off-camera, was completely mortified by the question, burying her head in her hands: As the Oscars question was asked @KellyannePolls literally buried her head in her hand \n— Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) February 22, 2017 \nHave a tip we should know?
