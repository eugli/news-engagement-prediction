College lacrosse: No. 2 Maryland drops No. 11 Navy in season opener Maryland Athletics Contact | Archive | RSS \nANNAPOLIS, Md. – The Maryland attack unit of Matt Rambo, Colin Heacock and Dylan Maltz combined for 15 points, and Dan Morris made 12 saves in his first career start to lead the No. 2 Maryland men’s lacrosse team to a 15-12 victory over No. 11 Navy at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium Saturday. 24 straight season-opening wins for the Terps! Also 88-3-1 all-time in openers! #BeTheBest — Maryland Lacrosse (@TerpsMLax) February 11, 2017 \nThe win marked the 24th consecutive season-opening victory for the Terrapins dating back to 1994. Maryland is now 88-3-1 all-time in season-openers. \nRambo matched his career-high with six points (3G, 3A) in the effort, carrying his momentum from a fantastic postseason campaign in 2016. He now has 40 points over his last seven games (5.7pts/g). Heacock added two goals and three assists for a career-high five points, while Maltz matched his career-best with four goals. \nMaryland wasted little time scoring its first goal of the season, as sophomore Austin Henningsen took the opening faceoff right down the middle for the goal just seven seconds into the game. \nAfter a pair of Navy goals, Maryland fired right back with two goals of its own. Connor Kelly scored an unassisted goal, before Colin Heacock fed Dylan Maltz for the go-ahead 3-2 advantage. \nThe teams continued to trade goals in the second quarter, with Matt Rambo scoring his first of the season followed by a beautiful rebound goal by Matt Neufeldt. With the score tied, 5-5, Jared Bernhardt scored his first collegiate goal with just 0.1 ticks on the clock in the first half.

Rambo assisted on three of the four goals, which included a fantastic feed to Nick Brozowski. \nNavy answered with two goals to cut its deficit to two, 10-8, but not before Maryland came back with another devastating four-goal run that included two Rambo goals. \nMatt Neufeldt had an excellent outing in his first game action since 2015, totaling six ground balls and three caused turnovers, while Bryce Young also added a pair of caused turnovers. \nThe Terrapins have a short break before returning to action Tuesday in Philadelphia, Pa., as they take on St. Joseph’s at 4 pm.
