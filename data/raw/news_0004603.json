At this time, the cause of the fire is unknown and being investigated.\nThe small town of 62,000 immediately came together, with leaders of different faiths sharing their support.\nMembers of the one Jewish temple in the town, the Congregation B’Nai Israel, were the first to offer their house of worship. They handed their synagogue’s keys to one of the mosque's founders.\n“We were very happy to do this,” Melvin Lack, treasurer of Congregation B’Nai Israel tells USA TODAY. “You feel what’s happening in the community and everyone reacts.”\nSoon, a GoFundMe page was created to raise money for reconstruction. Within only a few days, over $1 million had been donated, far surpassing the initial goal of $850,000.\n“Our hearts are filled with gratitude for the tremendous support we've received,” writes the page’s organizer, Omar Rachid. “The outpouring of love, kind words, hugs, helping hands and the financial contributions are examples of the true American Spirit and Humanity at its best.”\nSigns rest outside the Victoria Islamic Center a day after a fire destroyed the mosque in Victoria, Texas January 29, 2017. REUTERS/Mohammad Khursheed This is not the first time that different faith-based organizations have supported each other in time of need in Victoria.\nIn 2008, the Temple B’Nai Israel was vandalized when assailants painted swastikas and other anti-Semitic slurs on the building. The perpetrators were caught and the temple was cleaned. “Throughout that time period,” Lack says. “churches and the Muslim community, everyone poured out their hearts to us and said this is horrible.”\nDays after last weekend’s fire, the community continues to offer their support. On Tuesday, pictures emerged of young members of the community holding signs of love and support.\n***\nFor more stories like this, like Humankind on Facebook .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmvR7J&lang=en-us&flow_id=e4b3661c-2298-4bc4-a971-efe15ab6758d", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/e4b497f4-7ba4-4d8a-910c-6343044dd016/d6ea3e26-b1ef-47f5-8a7f-3143961b96bf.ism&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1006&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/e4b497f4-7ba4-4d8a-910c-6343044dd016/d6ea3e26-b1ef-47f5-8a7f-3143961b96bf.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;htt", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBgirmk.img", "http://api.gannett-cdn.com/Syndication/v5/assets/search?sc=msn-z5bfqkuatkp663x2kugs9b3f&cs=usat&format=json&fulltext=true&fq=assettypename:text&apiKey=z5bfqkuatkp663x2kugs9b3f&fq=tagid:2927a1a3-6532-47ff-879b-5f23daf1bfc0&count=50&fq=-authoringtypecode:promo&quot;}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "https://www.gofundme.com/victoria-islamic-center-rebuilding", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmvR7J%3focid%3dst&text=Jews+open+temple+to+Muslims+after+mosque+burns+down&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmvR7J%3focid%3dst", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/201702/3538/29906170001_5306855922001_5306850612001.mp4&quot;,&quot;shareUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/humankind/2017/02/01/jews-offer-their-temple-muslims-after-mosque-burnt-down/97348838/&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;USA", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmvR7J?blobrefkey=101&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;240&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;240&quot;}", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmvR7J%3focid%3dsl&title=Jews+open+temple+to+Muslims+after+mosque+burns+down&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmvR7J%3focid%3dsl", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmvLer.img&quot;}}", "https://www.facebook.com/humankindvideos", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA9UODq.img", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmvR7J?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;102&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmvR7J?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;480&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;480&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBphlIt.img", "http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/BBktwuo.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Jews"], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:59:05.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
