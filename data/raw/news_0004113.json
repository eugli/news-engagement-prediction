She’d get in trouble sometimes for being late because she’d wait on the handshake.\" Inspiration: Mr White Jr said he started the handshakes after watching LeBron James on the basketball court (NBC) \n“This year I started making handshakes with the kids at recess. It was just one or two students and then it became contagious. \n“I saw how much it meant to them, so I said, ‘Come on. Everyone come on.’ Then it was my full class, then it was kids from other classes. Now I have 3rd graders wanting to do it too.” Read more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:34:02.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
