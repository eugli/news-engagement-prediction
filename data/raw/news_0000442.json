Well, that was a lie.\n\"If it's being discussed and perpetrated at that level, then you have a national problem.\"\nGregg Popovich blasted Donald Trump for perpetuating the racist birther conspiracy theory as he reflected on white privilege in America. Source: Jason Miller/Getty Images It wasn't the first time Popovich spoke out against Trump.\nAfter the election, Popovich said he was \"sick to his stomach\" about the results and that he fears \"[America] is Rome.\"\n\"I'm a rich white guy, and I'm sick to my stomach thinking about it,\" Popovich said. \"I can't imagine being a Muslim right now, or a woman, or an African-American, a Hispanic, a handicapped person. How disenfranchised they might feel.\"\nAfter Trump's inauguration, Popovich expressed his support for the Women's March on Washington and characterized Trump's demeanor as \"worrisome.\"\nSource: YouTube Popovich has also condemned Trump's Muslim ban and hilariously burned the administration's reliance upon \"alternative facts.\"\nWhile Popovich was thoughtfully reflecting on race, Trump paid lip service to Black History Month and attacked the press.", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/buzzer/story/gregg-popovich-best-in-game-interviews-video-san-antonio-spurs-021016", "http://deadspin.com/gregg-popovich-explains-america-1787139771", "http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Spurs-Gregg-Popovich-talks-race-black-history-10904729.php", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBD7fGgaNV4", "http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/1/20/14340698/lebron-james-gregg-popovich-greatest-coach-of-all-time", "http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/spurs/article/Gregg-Popovich-uncensored-Discusses-the-10609311.php?cmpid=twitter-desktop", "http://gettyimages.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLFe-cDxGxY", "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/spurs-coach-gregg-popovich-alternative-fact-joke-article-1.2953843"], "published": "2017-02-04T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:55:24.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
