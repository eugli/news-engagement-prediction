I have to be more organized to stop my procrastinator side from taking over. But procrastination isn’t always bad. There are times when it can be beneficial to leave something until the last minute. \nHere are some tasks you can push to the bottom of your to do list: 1. Creative writing. \nI find when it comes to writing an article or a post for my blog at ListProducer.com -- the more time I have the longer it will take. Writing is one of those tasks that expands to fill any time you set aside for it. When I have an entire day to write a post, I always struggle to come up with the perfect first line. But if I wait until later in the day, it forces me to just write and that usually gets the creative juices flowing. Just make sure to leave enough time for an edit. \nRelated: 8 Ways Successful People Beat Procrastination 2.

Saying sorry. \nSome mistakes require immediate reconciliation, but in a situation where you may have made the wrong move with a client, hurt a friend’s feelings or got into an argument with a loved one, take a day before you apologize. Even if you realize you messed up right away, waiting will take the emotion out of the situation and allow you to reflect in an unbiased way. The more able you are to see from the other person’s perspective, the more genuine your apology is likely to be.
