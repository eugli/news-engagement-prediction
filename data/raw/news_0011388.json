This prompted their English teacher Kalyani to cane 30 of the students. One of the girls developed seizures following the 'punishment' and had to be rushed to the local area hospital. Some of the other girls, who complained that they were hit on their legs and hands were also examined by the doctor and treated for bruises. \n\nNagarkurnool district education officer Janardhan Rao suspended the teacher on Saturday. \n\nAccording to special officer Uma Devi, Kalyani conducted the fourth formative test as a preparatory exercise on Friday evening for the upcoming annual examination for Class 10 students. But with the students faring very poorly in the test, Kalyani thrashed the children with a stick.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:49:53.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
