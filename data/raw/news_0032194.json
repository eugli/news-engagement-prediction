(Photo: AFP / TOSHIFUMI KITAMURA) A \nSEOUL: They used to call him the \"Little General\" but Kim Jong Nam - once heir-apparent to his father and North Korea's then-leader Kim Jong Il - fell from grace in 2001 after a spectacular blunder. \nOn Tuesday (Feb 14), after more than a decade in exile from the North, Jong Nam - the 45-year-old half-brother of current leader Kim Jong Un - was widely reported by South Korean media to have been assassinated in Malaysia. \nBorn from his father's relationship with actress Sung Hae-rim, Jong Nam is known to have been a computer enthusiast, a fluent Japanese speaker and a student in both Russia and Switzerland. \nHe lived in Pyongyang after finishing his overseas studies and was put in charge of overseeing North Korea's information technology policy. \nBut the chubby eldest son of the supreme leader was already seen by Seoul experts as something of a political lightweight when in 2001 he fell out of favour. \nHe was embarrassingly detained at a Tokyo airport, trying to enter Japan to visit Disneyland on a false Dominican Republic passport, accompanied by two women and a child. \nJong Nam and his family afterwards lived in virtual exile in Macau, Singapore and China. \nJong Nam's half-brother Jong Un took over as North Korean leader when their father died in December 2011. \nIn an email exchange with a Japanese journalist published in 2012, Jong Nam spoke disparagingly of Jong Un, saying he lacked \"any sense of duty or seriousness\" and warned that bribery and corruption would lead to North Korea's eventual collapse. \nIn another exchange with the same reporter in 2012, Jong Nam said: \"Anyone with normal thinking would find it difficult to tolerate three generations of hereditary succession.\" \nIn October 2012 South Korean prosecutors said a North Korean detained as a spy had admitted involvement in a plot to stage a hit-and-run car accident in China in 2010 targeting Jong Nam. \nIn 2014 Jong Nam was reported to be in Indonesia - sighted at an Italian restaurant run by a Japanese businessman in Jakarta - and was said to be shuttling back and forth between Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and France. \nIn 2012 a Moscow newspaper reported that Jong Nam was having financial problems after being cut off by the Stalinist state for doubting its succession policy. \nThe Argumenty i Fakty weekly said he was kicked out of a luxury hotel in Macau over a US$15,000 debt. \nJong Nam's son Kim Han Sol studied at university in Paris. Back in 2012, when at school in Bosnia, he labelled his uncle Kim Jong Un a \"dictator\" in an interview. \n\"My dad (Jong Nam) was not really interested in politics,\" Kim told the interviewer when asked why his father was passed over for the dynastic succession in favour of his younger brother. - AFP/nc", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:01:20.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
