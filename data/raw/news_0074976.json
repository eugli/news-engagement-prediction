It’s Pokemon Day! Plus there could be a massive new Pokemon Go update \nBut instead, rebels can be seen discussing the dog, saying they managed to defuse the weapon. \nOne of them holds it by the head and strokes its ears as another gestures to the bottles and claims it was intended to kill them. \nClearly frightened, the dog stands motionless as the fighters speak to the camera.

Man collapses from being caned for having sex outside of marriage \n‘What was this animal’s crime? Even animals, ISIS booby traps them and send them out against us.’ \nAs they are pushed back by forces including the Iraqi army, Kurds, Shia militias, America, the UK, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Syria (not all working together), Isis fighters have turned to new methods to retain the territory they control. The rebels can be seen stroking it \nThe group is also using drones like those sold in shops, to drop bombs and grenades on forces trying to take back the Iraqi city of Mosul, as well as on civilians. \nSome claimed the video cannot be trusted as it was released by rebel forces, but the sight of a dog caught up in the fighting and being used as a tool of war is a shocking sight in any case. \nIsis fighters have previously posed with kittens in an attempt to soften their image and attract more foreign recruits.

When German tanks appeared, they strapped the dogs with explosives and the animals would run towards the tanks as they had been trained to do, blowing up themselves and the vehicle. (It was a not a particularly effective target as they would also run towards Russian tanks while wearing the bombs.) \nMore than 4,000 dogs served in the Vietnam war too. Some were scout dogs who walked ahead, meaning they would be the first hit by hidden explosives or ambushes. Other dogs were trackers or guards for bases.
