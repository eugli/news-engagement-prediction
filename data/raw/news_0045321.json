These days, you’re likely to see Hayett McCarthy on the Burberry runway or on billboards for brands like Coach , but she isn’t one of the many freshly scouted newcomers who moved effortlessly from high school to high fashion. Beginning her modeling career at 20, McCarthy worked a series of odd-jobs to support herself while pursuing her interest in modeling. “I was a dog groomer, an intern at a record label, all sorts of things,” said McCarthy backstage during New York Fashion Week . Crediting her varied gigs with teaching her multitasking and how to manage money, McCarthy spent her days immersed in the world of castings and shoots, then worked nights to pay the bills. “It was pretty tricky, during the day I’d shoot editorials and at night I’d be doing the night shift bartending in London. Eventually, fashion took over and I started modeling full-time.” Photographed by Corey Tenold McCarthy’s affable personality has impressed more than a few fashion insiders. From Christopher Bailey and Burberry’s casting directors, Barbara Nicoli & Leila Ananna, tapping her to open the brand’s Spring 2016 show, to Demna Gvasalia and Lotta Volkova selecting her for Vetements, McCarthy has a high-profile fan club. Calling to mind style muses like Jane Birkin (or her daughter Lou Doillon), she’s also made an impression with the street style crowd. Preferring to shop at charity shops in London, McCarthy’s bohemian look is the result of vintage finds and the occasional designer gift. “It’s good for the planet to reuse clothes instead of buying new ones,” she said. “I love shopping thrift stores because it’s all going for a great cause. However I’m very close to Burberry and Phillip Lim, so they happen to give me all sorts of wonderful new things that I love.” Photo: Getty Images Entering her third season, McCarthy still enjoys the long hours, late nights, and controlled chaos of fashion month. “It’s draining but you get a rush from it, you love it and you hate it but everyone’s in the same boat.” Energized by the characters she comes across backstage, McCarthy says that the real pleasure of fashion lies in the camaraderie behind the scenes. “What’s great is who you meet and who you chat with when you’re not doing the actual job,” says McCarthy. “The job itself can be lonely at times. It’s more about how confident and how comfortable you feel around different types of people–that’s what keeps things interesting.” Though McCarthy’s bartending years are far behind her, she’s happy to have those experiences under her belt. “I’m glad I started later and that I worked beforehand and learned the value of a dollar,” says McCarthy. “Of course I’m quite happy to be where I am now, too!” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:49:52.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
