I guess I just wanted to celebrate the mansion in all of its tattered glory.” Read More The cardboard cutout moves around the mansion (Photo: Jeff Minton) The pool, with a visitor (Photo: Jeff Minton) The monkey enjoys the attention from the bunny (Photo: Jeff Minton) Hugh's famous pyjamas (Photo: Jeff Minton) The mansion's pool (Photo: Jeff Minton) A Playboy Bunny cut-out gives instructions to guests (Photo: Jeff Minton) \nBut Jeff still seems surprised to have been let in with his camera. \n“I’m not exactly sure how I got permission to shoot the house, but I believe Hugh Hefner saw a photograph of a monkey I took for New York Magazine and thought it would be great for me to come shoot some of his animals,\" he adds. \n\"He actually has so many wild animals that he has a zookeeper on staff, as well as a pet cemetery.
