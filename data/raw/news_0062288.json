We are the heart of the ruling coalition and purported inroads by the opposition are merely a storm in a cup of tea,\" said Busienei. \nALSO READ: Opposition deal signals bruising internal competition \nHis sentiments were echoed by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, who said the visit by NASA was just another political rally that had nothing new to offer to the electorate. \nMr Mandago, who three years ago opposed a visit by Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) leaders ahead of the 2014 Saba Saba rally, said it would be prudent for NASA leaders to respect area politicians even as they seek votes. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T16:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:30:19.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
