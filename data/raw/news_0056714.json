By Matt Miller Feb 22, 2017 There are few truly good characters in Game of Thrones : Hodor, Pod, and Syrio are the only ones I can think of offhand. Ned? No way, he was so stubborn and noble that his entire family gets either killed or terrorized. Tyrion? Not really. We can't forget that he boozed and screwed while his entire family forcibly took power and threw Westeros into political chaos. Robb Stark? Nope! Remember when he decided to break a marriage contract and got literally everyone on his side killed? Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Anyway, one of those few good characters isn't even humanâ€”it's Arya's direwolf Nymeria. She was last seen in Season One when Arya let her loose in the Riverlands after attacking Joffrey. Nymeria was a very good wolf. As Game of Thrones fan site Watchers on the Wall reports , Nymeria might return in Season Seven: \nGame of Thrones has returned to one of the show's least known locations: Calgary, Canada, where they shoot the wolves against a green screen, and then blow them up in post-production to turn them into direwolves. And those weren't the only Stark pups around: Maisie Williams was there too! Most Popular Additionally, the site reports that one of the wolves on set looks a lot like the one who played Arya's Nymeria. If you recall, Sansa's direwolf Lady was killed when Cersei Lannister took revenge for Nymeria attacking Joffrey. Robb's Grey Wind died with him during the Red Wedding. Rickon's Shaggydog died when he was captured by the Umbers. And Bran's Summer died protecting him while Hodor held the damn door. There are only two Stark direwolves left alive: Jon Snow's Ghost and Nymeria, who is somewhere out there, hopefully returning in Season Seven.
