The photos were captured in the moments before and after Altintas drew a handgun and shot Karlov at an Ankara gallery on Dec. 19. \n“Burhan’s striking image was the result of skill and experience, composure under extreme pressure and the dedication and sense of mission that mark AP journalists worldwide,” AP Executive Editor Sally Buzbee said. “We are enormously proud of his accomplishment.” \nIn the winning photo, the assassin, wearing a suit and tie, stands defiantly, pistol in his right hand pointed at the ground and with his left hand raised, his index finger pointing upward. His mouth is wide open as he shouts angrily. The ambassador’s body lies on the floor just behind Altintas. \nPacing near the body of his victim, the gunman appeared to condemn Russia’s military role in Syria, shouting: “Don’t forget Aleppo! Don’t forget Syria!” Altintas, who was a policeman, was later killed in a shootout with Turkish police. \nOzbilici said his professional instincts kicked in despite the shocking scene unfolding in front of him. \nExplaining how he remained collected enough to keep taking pictures, he said: “I understood that this was big history, it was history, (a) very, very important incident.” \nThe winning image announced Monday was among 80,408 photos submitted to the prestigious competition by 5,034 photographers from 125 countries. The World Press jury awarded prizes in eight categories to 45 photographers from 25 countries. \nJury chairman Stuart Franklin called Ozbilici’s image “an incredibly hard-hitting news photograph” and part of a strong series documenting the assassination. \n“I think Burhan was incredibly courageous and had extraordinary composure in being able to sort of calm himself down in the middle of the fray and take the commanding pictures that he took,” Franklin said. “I think as a spot news story it was terrific.” \nDenis Paquin, AP’s acting director of photography, said Ozbilici’s actions that day were typical of his professionalism. \n“Burhan would tell you he was just doing his job. His humble professionalism, combined with incredible courage, enabled him to capture these unforgettable images,” Paquin said. \nOzbilici said that while he kept his camera trained on the gunman, he felt as if journalists around the world were saying, “Hey man, you are representing all of us. Don’t go away! Stand! We are supporting you, we are praying for you.” \nThe eclectic selection of winners in the photo competition’s eight categories highlighted the dominant news topics of the last year — including conflict in Syria and Iraq, Europe’s migrant crisis, the death of longtime Cuban leader Fidel Castro and the Olympic Games in Rio. \nWinning nature photos included images depicting humanity’s devastating effect on wildlife, such as a gruesome photograph of a poached rhino with its horn hacked off and another showing a turtle swimming while enmeshed in a green fishing net. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:08.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
