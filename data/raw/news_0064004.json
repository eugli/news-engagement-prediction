Murray expects the new tax, if approved, to raise $16 million per year to fund educational and health programs for students of color. The proposed ordinance would impose a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on distributors of sugary drinks. While few details of the proposal are available at this time, in a press release the mayor's office outlined which drinks would be taxed and which would not. During his State of the City address, Mayor Ed Murray said he will be proposing to the… more BUSINESS JOURNAL | Karen Ducey In that release, it says \"in-store prepared coffee beverages\" would not be taxed. The mayor's office did not respond to requests for comment, but taken at face value, the sugary-drink tax would not apply to Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) or any other coffee shops that make thousands of calorie-filled beverages per day in Seattle. A grande-size white chocolate mocha Frappuccino has 520 calories, for example. What we do know about the tax is: Sugary drinks include some forms of soda, energy drinks, juice and sweetened teas and coffees. It excludes drinks that are 100 percent fruit juice, in-store prepared coffee beverages and diet drinks. The tax applies to all distributors in the city regardless of the size of the business. While the tax may have a loophole for Starbucks and other coffee shops when it comes to coffee drinks made in-store, the popular bottled Starbucks Frappuccino coffee drinks the company has distributed with PepsiCo since 1996 will be hit with the tax. A bottled mocha coconut Frappuccino has 300 calories. Seattle is by no means the first city to consider this kind of tax. Philadelphia, San Francisco, Oakland, and Boulder, Colorado have already enacted a similar tax . The Washington Beverage Association released a statement Tuesday against the tax after Murray's address. \"Seattle taxpayers and small businesses are certainly in favor of making sure all Seattle students have equal opportunities to succeed in school,\" the association said. \"But there has to be a better way to do this than with a highly regressive tax that makes prices skyrocket on working families and hurts Seattle small businesses.\" Coral Garnick covers health care and retail for the Puget Sound Business Journal.
