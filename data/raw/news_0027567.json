Piers Morgan and J.K. Rowling got into a heated Twitter feud on Saturday, February 11, following Morgan’s appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher the night before. \nThe trouble started when Morgan, 51, tried to defend President Donald Trump ’s policies, including his most recent, defunct immigration ban, and Australian comedian Jim Jefferies shouted him down and told him to “f--k off.” Rowling, 51, caught wind of the controversial episode and took to social media to voice her glee. PHOTOS: Celebrity Feuds: The Biggest Ever! \n“Yes, watching Piers Morgan being told to f--k off on live TV is *exactly* as satisfying as I’d always imagined,” the Harry Potter author tweeted . Her message quickly circulated the Internet, with plenty of fans and celebrities alike cheering her on for calling Morgan out. Piers Morgan Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic \nIn response, the British TV host angrily hit back at Rowling with his own retort. “This is why I’ve never read a single word of Harry Potter,” he wrote. At that, the writer took Morgan to task and didn’t let up with a quick response to each of his attempts to defend his words. Because you had a premonition that one day the author would roar with laughter at seeing you called out for your bullshit on live TV? https://t.co/8rkKSqJTnG — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 11, 2017 . @piersmorgan Would you like a couple of hours to mock up some pictures of refugees carrying explosives to substantiate your position? https://t.co/sFj0kqIajd — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 11, 2017 . @piersmorgan If only you'd read Harry Potter, you'd know the downside of sucking up to the biggest bully in school is getting burned alive. — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 11, 2017 J.K. Rowling Michael Loccisano/Getty Images \n“The superior, dismissive arrogance of rabid Remain/Clinton supporters like @jk_rowling is, of course, precisely why both campaigns lost,” he wrote at one point , inciting Rowling to tweet, “The fact-free, amoral, bigotry-apologism of celebrity toady Piers Morgan is, of course, why it's so delicious to see him told to fuck off.” \nAt another point, Morgan called out all of Hollywood for its collective stance against Trump. “No bigger bullies right now than the shrieking, hysterical anti-Trump celebrity brigade,” he wrote. “You lost, so suck it up Dolores.” \nOther celebrities like George Takei , Patton Oswald and Don Cheadle also weighed in. No, it's because you lack imagination, and small children instinctively fear you. @jk_rowling https://t.co/TIPg8POLQ6 — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) February 11, 2017 The people who said Hillary Clinton was 'The Lesser of Two Evils.'
