As her older and (much) wiser sister, I always take it upon myself to give her advice. My vast three years of life experience that I have on her qualifies me as a life coach, right? \nI don't mean to give her crappy advice; it just kind of comes out of my mouth like word barf. And most of it probably applies specifically to the kind of person I am. Anyway, here's some garbage advice I have given my sister with no intentions other than to help her out. Thankfully there are other people around to help clarify my good intentions. Check out some of the things I have actually said to Maddy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:48:07.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
