Digitally altered image.

It is a middle power that needs rules and a level playing field. As one of our finest foreign policy thinkers, former Department of Foreign Affairs head Peter Varghese, put it in a 2015 speech: \"Australia can neither bully nor buy its way in the world, so an international, rules-based order is in our best interests.\" Advertisement \nTake another one of Christensen's Sunday night tweets: \"Russia [is] the real reason ISIS is losing.\" \nMoscow has propped up Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad but has targeted a wide range of anti-regime forces, not just the Islamic State, and has indiscriminately bombed civilians, killing thousands. \nIts intervention has removed any incentive for Assad to compromise and allow a political solution in Syria, ensuring that Syrian Sunnis will feel aggrieved for at least another generation. That will help seed the next generation of sectarian fighters and jihadists that will replace the Islamic State when it is defeated. \nBy contrast, the Australian Defence Force has for more than two years carefully targeted Islamic State forces in airstrikes while advising and training Iraqi forces on the ground. Not one civilian is known to have been killed in Australian air strikes, and the ADF's efforts alongside the US have tried to avoid empowering the Assad regime. \nMr Christensen also called Russia \"a democracy\" and branded the hacking of US political parties \"fake news\", even though Mr Trump himself has admitted Russia was responsible for the hacking and US intelligence agencies have stated in a public report that Russia hacked political parties for the express purpose of tilting the election in Mr Trump's favour. \nRussia is working to break up Europe and tear up the international system of rules and norms that has made the last 70 years the most prosperous and stable the world has seen. It wants to return the world to spheres of influence around powers that use might to make right. \nThat is the threat Russia poses to us all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:54:46.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
