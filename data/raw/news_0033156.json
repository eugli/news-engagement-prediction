The “Wolverine” star took to Twitter on Tuesday to reveal that he is undergoing treatment for basal cell carcinoma, again. The actor also advised people to use sunscreen. \nThe 48-year-old actor had his first skin cancer removed from his nose in 2013, when his wife Deborra-Lee Furness told him to go to the doctors to get a mole checked. Another basal cell carcinoma. Thanks to frequent checks & amazing doctors, all's well. Looks worse w the dressing on then off!

Boy, was she right!,” the actor first wrote back in 2013. \n“Please don’t be foolish like me. Get yourself checked. And USE sunscreen!!!” \nThe Australian actor is famous for his portrayal of comic book hero Wolverine in the X-Men series, a mutant known for his metal claws and fast healing powers. \nHe will be seen next in \"Logan\" which is slated to release on March.
