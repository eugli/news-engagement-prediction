(Evan Vucci/AP)  05 PM \nIn a rambling opening statement to a roomful of manufacturing CEOs, Donald Trump boasted about his crackdown on illegal immigration. \n“All of a sudden, we’re getting gang members out, we’re getting drug lords out of this country,” Trump said Thursday at the start of the White House “listening session.” \n“We’re getting really bad dudes out of this country at a rate no one has seen before,” he added. \nThe President’s comments came two days after the Department of Homeland Security released new guidelines that could lead to the most widespread deportations the country has seen in decades. Several of Trump’s top economic advisers attended the event, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.
