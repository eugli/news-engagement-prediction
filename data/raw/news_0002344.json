Both agencies have made aesthetic changes and updates that enhance the original “industrial complex” look and feel, said Weber Shandwick Senior Vice President Laura Garner . “Repurposed industrial artifacts create a steampunk-inspired edge that, when merged with whimsical murals and other playful accents, bears an uncanny resemblance to nearby City Museum,” Garner said. “The space evolves with its inhabitants: a 15-foot monster mouth appears beneath the nickname-engraved bar top, and a polar-bear-fur wall looms over the content studio, showcasing a rotation of employees’ creative works.” In addition, the office features more practical amenities, such as a communal lunch table and a fully-stocked bar. “This industrial-creative space — where ‘art’ meets ‘work’ — makes employees, their dogs and their clients, feel right at home,” said Garner, who did not disclose design or construction costs.
