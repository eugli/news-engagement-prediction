By: FE Online | Published: February 20, 2017 12:53 PM Triumph will offer the 2017 Street Triple with a host of new features than the outgoing model, but the design and styling of the motorcycle will remain unchanged. \nWe reported earlier that Triumph Motorcycles has unveiled the 2017 Street Triple in the UK and will bring the motorcycle in India in late 2017. Now, it seems that the two-wheeler maker will launch the refreshed Triumph Street Triple in the country in June-July, 2017. \nThe 2017 Triumph Street Triple will be available with a choice of three variants, namely; S, R and RS. All the variants will be powered by a 765 cc three-cylinder engine that will produce 111 hp of power in the S version. The R will develop 116 hp, while the RS trim will generate 121 hp of power. The engine on the updated Street Triple will be paired to a 6-speed transmission with slipper clutch. \nAround 80 percent of the engine parts will be new on the upcoming motorcycle such as the crank, Nikasil plated aluminium barrels and bespoke cams. Around 10 percent of the parts will be retained from the ongoing Street Triple. The company will use lightweight materials, which will make the 2017 model lighter by 1.5 kg than the current model. \nTriumph will also offer the Street Triple with a host of new features than the outgoing model. However, the design and styling of the 2017 Triumph Street Triple will remain unchanged. The new Street Triple model will feature twin-headlamps with LED lights, revised swingarm for improved stability and handling, a new instrument cluster with a 5-inch TFT display in six different screen styles controlled via a 5-way joystick. The switchable ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) controlled via the 'Rider Programmable Modes' with different riding settings like Road, Track, and Off-road as well as a traction control system will be equipped across the variants. \nThe RS trim is likely to get 41 mm Showa Separate Function Big Piston Fork at the front and Ohlins STX40 monoshock setup on the rear. The Brembo M50 4-piston radial monobloc calliper and 310 mm disc brake will be equipped on the front axles, while the rear will get a Brembo a 220 mm disc with a single piston calliper. \nAlso Read: 2017 Triumph Street Triple unveiled, India launch in late 2017 \nWith the above-mentioned changes made to the 2017 Triumph Street Triple, it is expected that the company will price the motorcycle higher than the outgoing model.
