The people of Utra Pradesh have given them (BJP) so much but rather than bringing achhe din then snatched everything you had. They took away your land, your job and your hard earned money.” \nThey can go to any extent to remain in power. Whole country is in deep pain due to their wrong policies and poor governance. Farmers are in trouble, youngsters are not getting job, housewives are struggling due to inflation. Our Dalits men are living in fear. The whole country is looking up to you (people). I request you to vote for Congress candidates,’ added Gandhi. \nThe fourth phase polling in Uttar Pradesh will be held on Thursday in 53 Assembly constituencies spread over 12 districts, including the backward Bundelkhand region and the Nehru-Gandhi pocket borough of Rae Bareli.
