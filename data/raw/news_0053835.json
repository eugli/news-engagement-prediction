No player, coach, selector or 12th man on drinks duty will be safe. \nIf you want to save yourself the brain aneurysm, here is our guide on how take a deep breath and rationally digest every series eventuality like a normal, sane human being. India wins the series 4-0 \nYell, scream and rage into that good night. Demand the sacking of the selectors and coach. If Steve Smith isn't already on notice, then he damn well should be. \nTell everyone who will hear you that we all saw this coming. Deep down we all knew. This team was so badly equipped for a tour of India, and yet we sent these cricketing lambs to the Indian slaughterhouse all the same. Photo: Nothing you do to emotionally fortify yourself from a 4-0 loss will make the pain any easier to bear. (AAP: Dave Hunt) \nAt some point, Shaun Marsh and Glenn Maxwell's temerity to be named in the touring squad should get a mention, before all attention is expended on how David Warner should be captain. \nWhile the likes of Steve O'Keefe and Nathan Lyon toil against spin-seasoned Indian batsmen, join the growing calls to replace them wholesale with a vast swathe of undercooked spinners who bowled well once in a Big Bash match. Australia draws one match as India wins 3-0 \nResign yourself to the glum reality that touring sides are all struggling in Test cricket at the moment. \nIf it helps numb the crushing pain, remind yourself that there are no great Test teams right now (including India! Ha!) and that the Indian team always struggles on the road. Photo: We can probably expect to see plenty of TV close-ups of Steve Smith's calculating but fretful gaze. (AAP: Dave Hunt) \nWhen the draw occurs, go big on the fact that it's the template for future dominance as we show our true Aussie grit. Unless it's because of the rain, in which case, go bigger. \nProceed to block every English media pundit on Twitter, but retweet a few of Shane Warne's sage team-selection suggestions. Then ponder over think pieces on whether Warne could still hack it in Test cricket, aged 47.
