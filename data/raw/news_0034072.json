Inside the bitter sugar dispute that puts One Nation in the political sweet spot Read more \nOn Monday morning the trade minister, Steve Ciobo, who represents a Gold Coast seat, said preferences should be determined on what’s best for the people of Queensland, and “what can put us in a position to govern”. \nBoth Ciobo and the treasurer, Scott Morrison , said Labor was in no position to criticise the Liberal party for preferencing One Nation when it regularly entered preference deals with the Greens. \nMorrison told 2GB the Greens were the most extreme party in parliament and would “open our borders, trash the budget and trash our sovereignty”. \nBut Abbott’s comments are a notable departure from his colleagues. In a radio interview on Monday, the former prime minister said Hanson was a different person than she was 20 years ago, which would justify the Liberals preferencing One Nation ahead of Labor. \nBut he said the Nationals should always be preferenced by the Liberal party ahead of everyone else. \n“It’s not up to me to decide where preference should go but, if it was, I’d certainly be putting One Nation ahead of Labor and I’d be putting the National party ahead of everyone,” Abbott said. “Because the National party are our Coalition partners in Canberra and in most states and they are our alliance partners in Western Australia .” \nAt the beginning of the month Joyce warned the Western Australian Liberals against giving preferences to One Nation in the state election because it would spark a political fight with the Nationals. \nOn Monday Joyce again made his displeasure known. “It is a statement of fact that the most successful governments in Australia are in Liberal-National government,” he told reporters. Bizarrely today the government chose to send out its trade and tourism minister to defend One Nation Anthony Albanese \n“Colin Barnett has been around the political game a long while and should seriously consider whether he thinks this is a good idea or whether he is flirting with a concept that ultimately will put his own side is in opposition.” \nMalcolm Turnbull has continued to deadbat the issue. Asked whether John Howard was right 20 years ago when he said One Nation should be put last on how-to-vote cards, Turnbull said preferences were “a matter for the WA division”. \n“They have got to make their judgment based on their assessment of their electoral priorities,” the prime minister said. “You have to remember their objective is to persuade people to vote Liberal and to return the Barnett government – and my suggestion is that West Australians vote Liberal … for the return of Colin Barnett’s very capable government.” \nOn Monday the Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese dismissed arguments from the government that Hanson had evolved during her 20-year political career. \n“Pauline Hanson herself has declared very proudly that her views are exactly the same and, indeed, much of the language in her first speech in the Senate mirrored the sort of xenophobia that we saw in her first stint in the House of Representatives after she was elected in 1996,” Albanese said. \n“Bizarrely today the government chose to send out its trade and tourism minister to defend One Nation and to say that they had sensible, economic policies. \n“Of all portfolios to pick, to pick the minister for trade and the minister for tourism to get out there and defend One Nation, to bring them into the mainstream, if you like, is quite extraordinary.” \nHe said One Nation’s vision of Australia was “one nation of Anglo-Celtic Christian people who, of course, are in heterosexual relationships and have nuclear families”. One Nation support in Queensland leaps from 16% to 23%, poll shows Read more \n“What we have seen in recent times is One Nation candidates get out there and abuse people on the basis of their cultural diversity that makes this country so strong,” Albanese said. \nOn the issue of Greens preferencing, Albanese said the Liberals were happy during the last federal election “to sit down and have preference negotiations with the Greens”. \nHe said he had major differences with the Greens “but there’s a big difference between the Greens political party, the views of people like Bob Brown and others who I disagree with, and the views of Pauline Hanson. A major difference.” \nThe Labor leader, Bill Shorten , said on Sunday that his party would not do preference deals with One Nation because “you’ve got to stand for something in politics”. \nShorten said Howard had decreed that One Nation be put last, and that was Labor’s position also. “I hope that will be the same for the federal Liberal party,” he said.
