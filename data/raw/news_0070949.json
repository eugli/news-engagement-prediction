Hi @HBO , why do you maintain a show with @lenadunham after she admitted to sexually molesting her sister? Asking for a friend. https://t.co/7t0JflHoqp ‚Äî Elliott Hamilton (@ElliottRHams) February 21, 2017 Then she started hating on Mark Ruffalo , which, come on. Who hates Mark Ruffalo? @MarkRuffalo is just another virtue signaling half wit who knows nothing of the Jewish plight https://t.co/i0INT6IgXV ‚Äî Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 21, 2017 That followed a dive into this week's argument about Sweden accepting Muslim refugees. Don't shift the goal posts.I am discussing the Muslim rape epidemic. But beforeyou make the retarded Christian terrorist argument, factcheck https://t.co/DqG1pdLNlg ‚Äî Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 21, 2017 I don't \"hate\" them... I disagree with absolutely everything they represent, and I am utterly unafraid to express my opinion. https://t.co/z4kMY4htgi ‚Äî Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 21, 2017 When people tried to ask her about Christian terrorists, she shot that down. Do the klu klux klan follow a religion that orders the death of apostates? When was the last time we saw a klan member blow up infidels? https://t.co/JyCNx6Vter ‚Äî Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 21, 2017 And dropped the Ted Cruz argument that the Democrats are to blame for the KKK. Yes, and thank god they've been all but eradicated and forced into obscurity... no thanks to the democrats who created them. https://t.co/NfSyS6Djj9 ‚Äî Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 21, 2017 She then went in on Keith Ellison. ‚Äî Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 21, 2017 Who then blocked her, which she said made him an anti-Semite. How anti semetic of you @keithellison üñïüèªüñïüèªüñïüèªüñïüèªüñïüèªüñïüèªüñïüèª pic.twitter.com/aJKdBjGUUp ‚Äî Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 21, 2017 Jameson, who is Jewish, also bashed Islam as a whole. I disagree with following an ideology that abuses women, kills gays, mutilates female children and murders apostates. https://t.co/HtEM0iuaMk ‚Äî Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 21, 2017 #tellauselesslie Islam is a religion of peace ‚Äî Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 21, 2017 Even moderate muslims believe homosexuality is a criminal offense, polygamy is the norm, women are considered animals. Shall I go on? https://t.co/u498BvywQG ‚Äî Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 21, 2017 You worship a prophet that bragged about butchering hundred of thousands of my people (Jews) which is reiterated in the Quran. https://t.co/ado28iMlGo ‚Äî Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 21, 2017 But Christian don't believe in putting their heads on pikes https://t.co/yO2RX7J37N ‚Äî Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 21, 2017 When pressed about other religions committing violent crimes, she basically called those false flags. A veiled attempt at pointing a finger, in order to take the spotlight off that war being waged by Islam against the western world https://t.co/4y3jYPsSFS ‚Äî Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 22, 2017 And then continued on against Islam. Once again, my view on Islam is not ONLY about their penchant for violence, it's their view on homosexuality, women's worth, polygamy https://t.co/eaJEvDU9Z5", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:29:22.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
