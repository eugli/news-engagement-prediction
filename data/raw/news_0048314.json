Lentils are the perfect candidate for a meat-free chili. They cook up earthy and meaty, and there's no browning or precooking necessary. \nThis hearty vegan chili comes together easily with the aid of a slow cooker. All you have to do is mix everything together, turn it on, and come back to a bowl of comforting vegan chili. (Image credit: Maria Siriano ) A Grocery-Store Tip for Easier Chili \nButternut squash adds sweetness to this easy chili, but you want to make sure the pieces are large enough. Too small and they break down and turn mushy during the long cooking time. The pre-cut chunks found in the produce section are perfect for this chili, plus you don't have to do any chopping. Sweet potatoes can be substituted for the butternut squash if you choose. \nTop this hearty chili with buttery avocado chunks and cilantro for some freshness. A dash of your favorite hot sauce and some hunks of cornbread alongside can turn this chili into a warming winter meal.
