I’m honored to have had the opportunity to work with him to nurture and grow our businesses, but mostly, I’m grateful to have called him my Dad, and I know my siblings feel the same.\" \nIlitch companies employ 23,000 full-time and part-time colleagues worldwide, according to the Detroit Free Press . The companies posted revenues of $3.4 billion in 2016. In 2016, Forbes magazine listed Ilitch and his wife, Marian as the No. 88 wealthiest people with a net worth of $5.4 billion.
