It’s a cozy little 750-square-foot space (4045 Judah St.) on the same block as Trouble Coffee and Outerlands, making this a lively zone in a sleepy neighborhood. Rey Romero It’s also where the N Judah ends, at the ocean— as such, the narrow space has been dubbed the “club car,” with an outdoor patio slated to open sometime in the spring. It’s a project owner Jim Woods holds dear, given his family’s long history of dwelling in the Outer Sunset. “It’s a great mix of people out there. I want my 60 year old uncle to be able to come in and feel like he's home, and I want families to be able to bring their kid in on a Saturday during the day,” Woods told Eater in December. At opening, there are eight taps of Woods beers (though only five at opening, see menu below), plus El Porteño empanadas for snacking. There’ll also be a Crowler machine, which cans fresh beer to go, on demand. And like at several of Woods’ other locations, there’ll be brewing happening onsite, in a 20-gallon brewing system. That means plenty of opportunity for small batches of experimental flavors, a hallmark of owner Jim Woods ’ brewing style. Outbound’s menu Outbound Outbound is open (starting Friday, February 3) Monday through Wednesday from 4 p.m. - 10 p.m., Thursday 4 p.m. - Midnight, Friday 3 p.m.- Midnight, Saturday 11 a.m. - Midnight, and Sunday 11 a.m. - 10 p.m. Rey Romero", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T10:32:39.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
