The tens of thousands of calls and emails to derail her confirmation all but guarantee she would begin her tenure as education secretary as a polarizing figure without the usual honeymoon period to get her bearings — or to repair fraught relationships with school groups and Capitol Hill. \nStory Continued Below\nSen. Patty Murray , the ranking Democrat on the Senate education committee, has already threatened to question “every decision she makes.” \n“There is a lack of confidence,” said Denise Marshall, executive director of the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, which assists parents of students with disabilities. “The onus is on her to reach out and create that trust and build those relationships because we don’t have a foundation in that regard right now.” \nHistorically, education secretaries have seized the secretary’s bully pulpit and traveled around the nation to promote their ideas. But that may be more challenging for DeVos since several mainstream K-12 organizations — including influential special education groups — have opposed her confirmation. Her poor performance during her confirmation hearing reinforced concerns about her lack of conventional classroom experience and commitment to public schools. \n\nPro-DeVos TV ads attack Democrats as ‘full of rage and hate’ By Alex Isenstadt \nDeVos would presumably be the cheerleader in chief for Trump’s promise to encourage vouchers and charter schools — an effort showcased in a $20 billion plan he rolled out on the campaign trail and in his selection of DeVos to run the department.\nBut she’s had to repeatedly reassure even Republican senators such as Susan Collins of Maine and Deb Fischer of Nebraska that she would not impose vouchers on any state.\n“While I’m a strong supporter of school choice, I am also respectful of state and local decisions on this issue,” DeVos wrote to Collins.\nThat wasn’t enough to persuade Collins, however, who declared on Wednesday that she would oppose DeVos’ nomination . Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski came out a short time later, saying that she, too, would vote no on the nomination after hearing “from thousands, truly, thousands of Alaskans who have shared their concerns about Mrs. DeVos.” \nDemocrats are expected to be united in their opposition. \nWhile Trump’s selection of DeVos has energized many school choice advocates who see vouchers and charter schools as an effective way to help low-income kids stuck in failing schools, those ideas are a much harder sell in some areas, particularly in rural states and towns. \nAs it stands now, a 50-50 split is expected on her Senate confirmation vote, which could come as early as Monday. That means Vice President Mike Pence would be called to cast the deciding vote — a first for a Cabinet secretary nomination. \nDeVos would start out with limits that most of her predecessors did not. The 2015 education law that updated No Child Left Behind explicitly bars the secretary from incentivizing states to adopt certain standards, such as the controversial Common Core math and reading standards for K-12.\nAnd neither she, nor the Trump administration, has yet to spell out their education plan. Even with Trump’s promise to increase funding for charter schools, it’s unclear how that would be funded or carried out — although making changes to the tax code to encourage expansion is one possibility. Less still is known about the administration’s plans for higher education, as lawmakers begin work this year on a rewrite of the law that governs federal student loans, which could include an overhaul of accreditation and loan policies.\n\nFormer Education Secretary King speaks out against DeVos, Trump By Caitlin Emma \nPeter Cunningham, a former top aide to former Education Secretary Arne Duncan, suggested that DeVos will have to go out of her way to meet with groups — and do a lot of listening to win people over.\n“If there is a more balanced side, this is the time to show it,” he said. \nThat view was seconded by Noelle Ellerson of AASA: The School Superintendents Association, who said DeVos will have to reach out to teachers and superintendents who don’t like her if she wants to appeal to them. \n“It’s a necessity of that office to be open, transparent and facilitating conversations — especially the tough ones where you don’t agree,” she said. Her group has remained neutral on the confirmation.\nTo be sure, some of what DeVos wants to do might be accomplished regardless of her perceived mandate. \nWith Republicans in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, Democrats may complain but they have little ability to stop DeVos.\n“A lot of us screamed about the Obama administration, but that didn’t really matter,” said Michael Petrilli, president, of the conservative-leaning Thomas B. Fordham Foundation.\nIf Democrats challenge DeVos on everything she does, she might do “what she thinks is appropriate without undue concern,” said Rick Hess, an education scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\n“In some ways, I think that will make things more challenging for her and other ways, I think it will be liberating,” Hess said.\nBut the education secretary — more than many Cabinet officials — touches the lives of millions of Americans and even Republicans would be likely to push back against plans that they regarded as harmful to local schools or unpopular with their constituents. \nOf course, even without Congress, DeVos could make policy through guidance and regulations. One of the most controversial moves of Obama’s Education Department was to issue guidance on the handling of sexual assault cases under Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination. DeVos has promised to hold schools accountable for violating Title IX, but advocates worry she will interpret it differently.\n\nConway slams Democrats as 'crybabies' for not confirming Trump's Cabinet picks By Louis Nelson \nWhen asked about the animosity toward DeVos, HELP Chairman Lamar Alexander this week blamed it on tension left over from the “very testy” November election.\n“I expect her to assemble an experienced team of people, once she’s confirmed,” Alexander said.\nSimilar assurances came from Ed Patru, a spokesman for a group of allies backing DeVos, who insists the contentious confirmation fight won’t have a lasting impact. He said Democrats’ leftward slide has created a climate that he predicted would lead to more 50-50 deadlocks in the Senate. \n“I think this is the new normal,” Patru said.\nBut several education groups said they will be watching to see how much of an effort DeVos makes to engage with those who work directly with students and their parents.\n“Her success will depend on engaging principals, assistant principals and other education stakeholders,” said JoAnn Bartoletti, executive director of the National Association of Secondary School Principals.\nCaitlin Emma and Michael Stratford contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:11:40.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
