(Steve Millar / Daily Southtown) Steve Millar Daily Southtown Privacy Policy \nIt didn't take long for Sandburg/Stagg freshman gymnast Maddie Giglio to make a good impression on junior Maddy Roe. \n\"She's a great gymnast,\" Roe said. \"She has club background so we bonded there. She's just a really sweet girl. Plus, we're Maddy and Maddie. It's perfect.\" \nMaddy and Maddie are both headed to the state meet, which begins Friday at Palatine. They'll each compete in all-around as well as all four events. \nAfter stunning the field to win the all-around title at the Oswego Sectional, Sandburg student Giglio is the newcomer with nothing to lose. Stagg student Roe is the veteran out for redemption after a disappointing 2016 state meet. \n\"I think they both can do some big things,\" coach Mike White said. \"No one in the world expected (Giglio) to win the all-around at sectionals, but she hit all her routines and got it done. (Roe) has experience and she's ready. \n\"My goal is for them to both finish in the top 10 in the all-around and have one in the top five. If they both hit, they could both finish in the top five.\" \nGiglio said she's blown away her own expectations for this season. Roe has helped her every step of the way. \n\"Winning sectionals is not something I pictured myself doing,\" Giglio said. \"I just went out there and gave it my all and I hit everything. I was so nervous, but having Maddy by my side helped me so much. \n\"She helps me calm down. She helps me go through my routines and know what I need to do. I'm so grateful.\" \nRoe was a delighted mentor after sectionals, despite her own disappointing fourth-place finish in the all-around. \n\"I was so, so proud of her,\" Roe said. \"I wanted her to do her best and she obviously did. She did absolutely amazing. I've tried to help her out as much as I can this year. It's been great for both of us.\" \nWhile Giglio said she has \"absolutely no idea\" what to expect at state, Roe plans to give her some pointers. \nIt'll be Roe's third time at the state meet. She finished 21st in the all-around in 2015 and ninth last year. \nWhat she remembers most about last year, though, was her performance on balance beam. She was tied for fifth in the preliminaries, but fell twice in the finals and finished 11th. \n\"I don't want that to happen again,\" Roe said. \"I've been working my butt off on beam so much. That's the No. 1 thing I really want to succeed on. \n\"It's going to come down to extreme focus and not getting in my own head. I know I'm capable of it. Last year, I psyched myself out. Sometimes I try so hard not to fall that I do fall. I just need to stay composed and be confident in myself.\" \nHaving Giglio there figures to help. \n\"I'm so glad she'll be competing with me,\" Roe said. \"We'll help each other. I was hoping for a close teammate bonding experience with her and we've got that.\" \nSteve Millar is a freelance writer for the Daily Southtown. \nGIRLS GYMNASTICS STATE MEET", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:49:09.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
