His key lieutenants Diane Abbott and Shami Chakrabarti also skipped the weekly meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party. Instead, the shadow home secretary and shadow attorney general were seen in a Commons bar, the Pugin Room, as Labour peers and MPs discussed the fallout from the Copeland by-election, won by the Tories. Labour MPs voiced dissatisfaction at the pair’s absence. Graham Jones, Labour MP for Hyndburn, said: ‘I am disappointed that it appears Shami and Diane were in the Pugin Room.’ Lady Chakrabarti used an interview on BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday to blame the media, disunity in the party and the poor weather for the humiliating by-election defeat. Diane Abbott and Shami Chakrabarti also avoided the ire of Labour parliamentarians. Instead the shadow home secretary and shadow attorney general chose to talk in the Commons bar But after the PLP gathering, Mr Jones said: ‘She had a lot to say at the weekend. It’s a shame she didn’t have a lot to say in there.’ Earlier, one of Mr Corbyn’s closest allies had claimed that the Labour leader was facing a behind-the-scenes ‘soft coup’ from Labour MPs who want to destroy him. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said ‘covert plotters’ want to stop the leader from winning elections even if this means losing their seats and risking the end of the party.
