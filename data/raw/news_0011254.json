Not behind closed doors, in the privacy of my office or my colleagues' -- but publicly, clearly, directly,\" he said. \"He needs to demonstrate his independence. Otherwise, the American people will have justifiable doubts that he will be more than a rubber stamp.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:22:16.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
