Trump vocal on Chicago violence As President-elect, Trump encouraged Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to ask for federal assistance. Emanuel said he \"welcomed\" the idea of greater federal assistance to address crime in the city following Trump's comments. Shortly after taking office in January, Trump tweeted about the shootings in Chicago: \"I will send in the Feds\" if they don't fix the \"horrible carnage\" going on. If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible \"carnage\" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017 Emanuel said federal authorities already play an integral role in fighting crime in the city, referencing the transport of guns across state lines, among other areas. \"A lot of the guns, you know, coming into Chicago come from out of state,\" Emanuel said. \"Federal entities are set up to deal with that. And they do. And they work with us.\" Chicago PD's priority list for 2017 New technology: Body cams on 2,100 officers covering seven districts; expansion of gunshot detection systems. More training: Officers will have more Taser training so they can use the least amount of force necessary; training to help officers recognize signs of mental illness, trauma and crisis situations. New leadership: Chief Anne Kirkpatrick will lead the new Bureau of Professional Standards, which will be responsible for implementing reform. Community policing: There will be an advisory panel -- made up of experts and residents -- that will help mend relationships between officers and members of the community. \nPreviously, Emanuel has specified areas he'd like the federal government's help -- including gun control, gun tracking, prosecution for gun crimes and help increase funding for more police officers. Though Chicago does have strict gun laws, 60% of the guns used in shootings were purchased out of state. Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner recently signed a new gun control law that imposes harsher penalties on those who bring in guns from out of state to sell and do not have gun-owner ID cards. Last year, marked the deadliest year the city has seen in nearly two decades with a reported 762 homicides.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:31:58.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
