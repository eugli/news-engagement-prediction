The premises were entertainment outlets,” SAC Fadzil said. \nPlain-clothes police turned up and surrounded Jamal’s home in Ampang at 12.30pm yesterday. \nSpeaking to The Star from inside his home, Jamal, who is also Sungai Besar Umno chief, claimed that he had informed the police that he would turn up at the Ampang police station at 3pm. \n“So I really do not know why so many of them are here in front of my house. Maybe they do not want me to speak to the press. \n“I really am not sure, but that is the only explanation I can find. \n“I am prepared to be held and arrested as long as the issue at hand, which is illegal gambling, is addressed,” he said. \nJamal finally came out of his house at 3pm, waving to a crowd of curious onlookers including his neighbours. \nHe was then taken to a police car and driven to the Ampang police station.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:47:59.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
