The integrity commissioner’s investigation focused only on the agency’s bungled response to the complaints. \nAfter meeting with over 30 witnesses and reviewing documentary evidence, Friday says he concluded that either “the outcome or resolution of the harassment complaints was in fact pre-determined or … senior management was extremely careless.” \nArchibald left the public service in October 2016, but Étienne remains at the CFIA as vice-president of operations. It’s unclear if he will face any disciplinary action. \nThe initial three harassment complaints will be re-examine by the CFIA in the meantime. \nLast week, Friday issued a similarly damning report detailing the extreme behaviour of a senior manager at the Public Health Agency of Canada, who is still employed by the government. \nThat executive allegedly screamed at employees, called them “incompetent,” swore, advanced on people with closed fists, threw files and papers and banged on his desk in anger. \nOn Thursday, Friday told reporters that two cases is not enough to “support a general trend” of executives failing to implement policies and procedures when it comes to workplace harassment, but “I do think it’s necessary to remark upon the situation at this time.” \n“A different set of rules should not apply to senior executive than those that apply to the rest of employees,” Friday said. \n“These findings reinforce the importance of senior management’s responsibility to address (harassment) matters as soon as they arise, and in their entirety.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
