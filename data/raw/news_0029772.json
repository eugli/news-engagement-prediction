Growing up the son of a Pentecostal minister taught songwriter Bernie Herms a few lessons on the road to the Grammy Awards. Most importantly, teamwork with your fellow musicians can elevate the spirit of song. THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO, Dominick Guillemot   \nCanadian songwriter Bernie Herms came out an early winner at the pre-telecast Grammy Awards ceremony on Sunday. \nThe London, Ont.-born and Edmonton-raised musician took home a golden gramophone for best contemporary Christian music performance or song for “Thy Will” by Hillary Scott and the Scott Family. \nScott, who is a singer in Lady Antebellum, also won best contemporary Christian music album for “Love Remains,” which features Herms’ song.   \nThe spirit of Leonard Cohen’s music was felt during a performance by Grammy-nominee Judy Collins. The folk singer began with a memory of Cohen, a long-time friend and collaborator, and the first time he brought her the lyrics to “Suzanne.” \n“He came into my living room and said, ‘I can’t play the guitar and I can’t sing,” she told the audience. \n“And I don’t know if this is a song.” \nShe then launched into a solo performance of the Montreal poet’s famed song on a grand piano. \nA number of other Canadians are up for Grammys in the pre-telecast, including indigenous singing group Northern Cree. \nWatch below: An Alberta band is heading to the Grammys to help kick off the big award show. Northern Cree is also nominated for Best Regional Roots Music Album. \nThe early show is streaming at Grammy.com/live. \nSeveral Canadians are also going for gold at Sunday’s main Grammy Awards ceremony, including two of the country’s biggest pop performers. \nDrake and Justin Bieber will square off against country singer Sturgill Simpson and pop powerhouses Adele and Beyonce, who are all nominated for album of the year. \nREAD MORE: 59th annual Grammy awards features notable Canadian nominees \nThe evening’s biggest prize is only one of eight nominations Drake has in his pocket. \nThe Toronto-raised hip-hop star’s “Views” is also in the running for best rap album, while “Hotline Bling” is nominated for best rap or sung performance. \nDrake is also being considered for his vocal contributions to Rihanna’s smash hit “Work,” which is up for both record of the year and best duo or group performance. \nHe’s not expected to attend this year’s ceremony due to schedule conflicts with his European tour. \nDrake only counts a single Grammy to his name for the 2011 rap album “Take Care.” \nBieber is another Canadian hoping to grab a few statues at this year’s show. \nHe’s nominated for his single “Love Yourself” in the best song and best pop solo performance categories. \nHis album “Purpose” is also up for best pop vocal album. \nBieber also only has one Grammy, which he won last year for contributing vocals to “Where Are U Now,” a side project of Skrillex and Diplo. © 2017 The Canadian Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:50:27.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
