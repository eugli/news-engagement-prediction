ADVERTISEMENT \nMost of the escaped inmates are from Bulacan. Several of them have been in jail for five months, Azurin said. \n“We all consider them high value targets because the volume of illegal drugs seized from [the escaped suspects] are big,” Azurin added. \nHe said the police manhunt has spread to Metro Manila and other provinces in Central Luzon. /rg a", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T17:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T12:38:58.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
