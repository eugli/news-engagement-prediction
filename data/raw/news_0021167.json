Lovren was three and his family’s idyllic life in the multi-cultural village of Kraljeva Sutjeska was decimated by the Balkans war. \nLovren has referenced his experiences as a childhood refugee throughout his career, but his recent recollections detailing the chaos, fear and intolerance confronting those displaced by global conflict carry greater resonance. \nHis latest emotional interview was broadcast in a moving documentary produced by Liverpool’s in-house TV channel, in which Lovren pleaded for more compassion and understanding to be shown towards the refugee community. \n“When I see what’s happening today I just remember my thing, my family and how people don’t want you in their country,” said Lovren. “I understand people want to protect themselves, but also people don’t have homes. It’s not their fault; they’re fighting for their lives just to save their kids. They want to go away and have a secure place for their kids and their futures. \n“I went through all this and I know what some families are going through. Give them a chance, give them a chance. You can see who the good people are and who are not.” Lovren speaks from the heart in the short film about his life as a refugee Credit: LFCTV \nI n the light of recent political developments both in the United Kingdom and in the United States, the timing of the Lovren documentary – which was aired on LFCTV on Wednesday evening – is poignant. On Wednesday the UK government ended a commitment to rehousing 3,000 Syrian child refugees, limiting the number to 350. \nLovren’s testimony is an appeal for humanity over self-interest. \n“Kraljeva Sutjeska was a family town, 12,000 people living in this small village. It was quite peaceful, no stress, nothing,” said Lovren. I couldn’t imagine today to run away with my kids, and to really be scared for your life; it’s about your life, it’s not about a job or something like that Dejan Lovren \n“We had everything. We never had problems. Everything went well with the neighbours – with the Muslims, with the Serbs, everyone was talking very well between each other and enjoying the life, everything was like how they wanted. And then it [the war] happened. I just remember the sirens. I was so scared because I was thinking ‘Bombs’. \n\"I remember my mum took me and we went to the basement – I don’t know how long we’d been sitting there. Afterwards, I remember Mum, my uncle and my uncle’s wife, we took the car and then we were driving to Germany, 17 hours.

I couldn’t imagine today to run away with my kids, and to really be scared for your life; it’s about your life, it’s not about a job or something like that. You’re leaving behind everything you had before. \n“It was a rough time for my mum because she was always crying and crying, and I never understood that. I was sometimes angry, always, ‘Why, Mum? Come on, stop it, it’s finished, we are here now, everything’s safe’. But you know, I never understood it. \n“It always gets my memories back when I watch these documentaries about Bosnia in the war, and it’s not so easy, to be honest. You see all the horrifying images. I would say we had luck. We had our grandad who was working before in Germany, and because of that he had the papers to say, ‘Yeah, come to us’. If not, I don’t know what we could’ve done. \n“I remember we came to my grandad’s house – a little wooden house. It was so small but it was full of love – 11 of us lived there for three years. My mum said that every night, around 10pm, they switched on the radio and everyone listened to the news and what had happened in Bosnia. The main question was when will the war stop?” Thousands were killed and thousand saw their homes destroyed during the conflicts Credit: Getty Images \nL ovren, who was three when the war broke out, remembers how welcome he was made in Germany. “Germany gave us their open hands. I don’t know which country could do that at that time to welcome refugees from Bosnia,” he said. \n“I was just a happy guy, a happy little child. I never felt the problems. I just started to play football around the age of five or six – I just loved the ball, playing with my dad around the backyard, just enjoying football. I’d heard of Bayern Munich. I had so many idols at that time; I went to the training ground when I was six or seven years old. I took some pictures with the superstars – Bixente Lizarazu and Lothar Matthäus. It was my home town. Because of that I loved Germany – Munich was a proper city, every third man was Croatian, a lot of Croatians still living there today. \n“My mum and dad were asking for permission to stay more, but every six months it was declined. The authorities said, ‘When the war is over, then you can go back’. So every six months my mum and dad had their bags packed to go back. It was quite tough – you never had a future in Germany.

But after a further four years, we were still in Germany because the situation [in the Balkans] still wasn’t the best. They didn’t give us the papers to stay, and then one day that day came and they said, ‘You have two months to prepare your bags and go back’. \n“For me it was difficult because I had all of my friends in Germany, my life had started there. I had everything, I was happy, I was playing in a small club, my father was the coach there – it was just beautiful.” \nL ovren was 10 when his family returned to the Balkans, leading to another difficult period of readjustment. “We moved to Croatia. After so many years in Germany you’re used to it, the German style and everything, you speak the language,” he recalled. Give them a chance, give them a chance. You can see who the good people are and who are not Dejan Lovren \n“At my home I spoke Croatian but not the proper Croatian – the right words and everything – so when I came aged 10 to Croatia it was difficult. I didn’t understand, I didn’t know how to write, everyone was asking me, ‘Why is your accent different to ours?’ and even today I have that German accent in my Croatian. \n“I had problems in the school because of that. Something in me didn’t allow for people to laugh about me, and then I had the school fights – I was fighting. \n“The teachers explained that, ‘He’s come from another country, you need to have more understanding about everything what he went through’. To be honest, the only thing that they didn’t laugh about was football and how I was playing football. I think this is why people started to respect me. They were saying I was a ‘crazy boy who was shooting at the wall and making neighbours crazy’. I was crazy about football. I was living for that.

My father was working as a house painter, doing all the work in the houses for other people, and he was really good at that. I remember we had a quite difficult situation with money.” \nL ovren’s professional career began with Dinamo Zagreb before he moved on to Lyon, Southampton and now Liverpool. The family’s painful memories linger within the 27-year-old. Refugees who made it to the Premier League \n“It’s like the war happened yesterday for me, my mum, other people – it’s still fresh,” said Lovren. “I hope for the next generation that it’ll be much easier, for my daughter and my son, maybe they’ll forget it and move on. I don’t know if they’ll ever understand my life or my situation, what I’ve been through, because they live in totally different worlds. \n“When you go through the pain, somewhere there is light at the end of the tunnel.” The full documentary “Lovren: My Life as a Refugee” is available free on LFCTV GO. www.liverpoolfc.com/video Follow Telegraph Football", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:25:16.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
