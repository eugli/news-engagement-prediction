He says his company received products worth only 400,000 rupees ($6,000), many of them of inferior quality. \nMalhotra said when he demanded a refund, he received just one million rupees ($15,000). \nRelated: Apple is set to start making iPhones in India \nMalhotra said Goel resorted to intimidation when asked for the rest of the money. \n\"When we called them to ask for our money back and to end our association with them, he said he didn't have the money,\" he said. \"He threatened that something will go wrong if we don't wait quietly.\" \nGoel is scheduled to appear in court on Friday, according to Ghaziabad's deputy superintendent of police, Manish Mishra. The search for the other four suspects is still underway. \nRinging Bells launched its Freedom 251 smartphone last year to great fanfare. The phone was priced at just 251 rupees ($3.76), a deal many industry experts said at the time was too good to be true. One analyst said the company would lose $26 for every device it sold. \nRelated: How Micromax took the fight to Apple and Samsung \nRinging Bells could not be reached for comment, and the company's website was down on Friday. \nGoel, who reportedly stepped down as managing director in December, did not respond to multiple requests for comment but told the Hindustan Times newspaper that he had promised to pay several distributors back by Mar. 31 this year. He said he found the accusations against him \"surprising.\" \nBut the executive's troubles may only just be beginning. Another distributor has filed a similar complaint with police, while several more are starting to jump on the bandwagon. \n\"Calls are coming in and victims are coming forward,\" Mishra said. \"We currently have complaints that they defrauded various distributors of a total of 4 million rupees ($60,000) but I suspect the actual amount is double.\" CNNMoney (New Delhi)  18 AM ET", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:38:09.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
