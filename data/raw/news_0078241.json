Plans to combine the London Stock Exchange ( LDNXF ) with Deutsche Boerse ( DBOEF ) , which runs the main German stock market, have been in the works for more than a year. \nBut late Sunday, the London exchange warned that the deal has run into trouble with European regulators. \nRelated: Europe is getting a new stock exchange giant \nThe European Commission, the EU's top antitrust watchdog, told the London exchange this month that the company will need to sell off a bond-trading platform in order to win approval for the merger with Deutsche Boerse. \nBut the London exchange said the sale would cause various problems, including damaging its business in Italy, where the trading platform, MTS, is \"systemically important.\" It said the Commission already rejected one alternative solution proposed by the stock exchanges. \nAs a result, the London exchange said it's not going to submit a plan to sell MTS in time to meet the Commission's deadline on Monday, making it \"unlikely\" the regulator will approve the merger. \nRelated: Stock exchange boss investigated for alleged insider trading \nIt's not giving up on the deal altogether, vowing in its statement to \"continue to take steps\" to try to make it happen. But it also made sure to mention that it's \"highly confident\" in its business prospects if the merger falls apart. \nThe European Commission and Deutsche Boerse didn't immediately respond to requests for comment outside of office hours. \nBilled as a \"merger of equals,\" the all-share transaction would effectively be a takeover if it does go ahead: Deutsche Boerse shareholders would end up owning more than 54% of the new combined group, and the German company's CEO, Carsten Kengeter, would be chief executive. \nThe deal would build a powerful link between Europe's premier financial centers. London is a global center for banking and insurance, while Frankfurt is home to the European Central Bank and is the finance hub for Germany, the world's fourth biggest economy. \nCNNMoney (Hong Kong) First published February 27, 2017: 12:36 AM ET", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:44:19.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
