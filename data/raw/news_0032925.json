Little Caleb, who was just 10 years old, died while riding the Verruckt waterslide , which was the tallest in the world. And now, his parents are finally speaking out about the horror they endured. Scott and Michelle Schwab spoke publicly for the first time in an interview with Good Morning America on Monday. “Six went to the park and five came back,” Scott, who is in a Kansas state representative, said. “Before they took off I said, ‘Brothers stick together,’ and [Caleb] said, ‘I know, dad.’” In January, the family settled with the water park for an undisclosed amount of money, which will go to Caleb’s three brothers. The Schwab family claims that though Caleb’s death was an accident, negligence contributed to it; the park claims that safety always has and will be their top priority. Once an investigation is complete, Schlitterbahn will tear down the slide . Now, the family is coming together to pay tribute to Caleb’s memory. Michelle said she misses “giving him hugs, hearing about his day, watching him play soccer. I mean, so much, so many things.” They have a box of greeting cards from around the world from people sending their condolences, and now they’re speaking out to thank everyone for their support. “We just want people to know that we’re thankful and we’re still hurting but we’re going to be okay,” Scott said.
