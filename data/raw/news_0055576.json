Tracing the voice behind Imman’s latest hit has led to an interesting discovery... the voice comes to us from Canada. Luksimi Sivaneswaralingam, a Sri Lankan based in Toronto, is Kollywood’s latest find. “The feeling is yet to sink in. Not many people get such a solid start and I thank Imman sir for that.” \nThis full-time music teacher says she had to work on her accent for the rendition. “It had to be in tune with the film’s mood. It’s a song \nwhere the heroine sheds all inhibitions to express her love. So we added a bit of huskiness to the voice and I’m glad it has worked with the audience.” \nLuksimi was just three years old when she began her lessons in music. “I’m trained in Bharatanatyam, veena, piano and Western classical vocals.” \nThe singer was also conferred with the title of Natya Kala Jyothifor her classical dance. \nImman says he stuck to his gut feeling that the song will turn out to be a chartbuster. “I felt a new voice would suit the song and that’s how I narrowed it down to Luksimi. She had sent me her voice clip through Instagram. Later, I met her at a show in Toronto. When the right moment came, I did not have to look elsewhere.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:31:09.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
