The video puts Perry in an amusement park right out of 1950s science-fiction, with rides alluding to the notion of the American dream and the nuclear family. A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on Feb 22, 2017 at 9:48am PST \nMore than a week before taking to the BRIT Awards stage, Perry called the gig the “2nd chapter of ChainedToTheRhythm” in a tweet , with her politically-minded performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards likely being the first. \nThe Grammy performance featured a house and fence with a series of dancers moving the set pieces across the stage. Perry wore a black and white pantsuit with white tennis shoes as she sang. Her attire is believed to be a nod to Hillary Clinton , whom Perry supported on the campaign trail by performing at rallies and the Democratic National Convention last July . \nThe “Teenage Dream” singer will take to the stage again on March 5 at the 2017 iHeartRadio Music Awards .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:02:24.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
