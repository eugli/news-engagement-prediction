Vendors showcasing their products and services during the one-day Women Empowerment Bazaar by Avana at SS 15 Courtyard in Subang Jaya. \nThe one-day event was organised by Avana, a platform that enables social media users to make purchases from their desired merchants within the merchant’s social media channel. \nApart from Haziq, there were also youths from Tender Hearts, a social enterprise that provides skills to young people with special needs. \nThey sold cooked and baked goods at the bazaar. \nThere was also medical check-ups by DEMC Specialist Hospital and manicure services. \nTen percent of all sales on the day went to Nasom. \nAvana chief operating officer Soh Yien Yee said this was the first time they were organising such a bazaar as part of their corporate social responsibility. \n“Nasom is our neighbour, and we see each other every day, so we at Avana decided to do more for them,” she added.

Ten percent of all sales on the day went to Nasom. \n“We also chose to support the cause because, personally, the co-founder and I have cousins with autism, and one of our colleagues has a sibling who has autism.” \nSoh said people did not know much about autism, so an event like this helped the public to learn more about the condition. \n“We should not see those with autism differently, but should instead learn how to help them,” she said. \nShe added that they wanted to run a bazaar to attract a different audience to support the cause, as well as help women vendors, because more and more women were venturing into business. \n“We are giving them an avenue to reach out to more people at this bazaar,” Soh said, adding that all vendors were given free training on e-commerce and how to manage a business before the event. \nNasom chairman Feilina Feisol said public view on autism had changed in the cities. \nToday, Nasom has about 500 persons with autism registered with them nationwide and 287 teachers. \n“We have various programmes, from early intervention for those as young as two and a half years old. Our oldest is 36. We also have vocational centres,” she said. \nFeilina said it was important to work with partners like Avana to raise public awareness on autism, especially for parents who may not know what to do with autistic children. \nShe hoped to open a holistic place for those with autism. \nThis, she explained, would give persons with autism a chance to explore work options such as caring for animals, planting crops or even something as simple as watering plants in a farm, instead of just limiting them to baking and cooking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:52:13.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
