People do say, did say to me repeatedly over months and years, that’s not on offer.”\nAsked whether German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders of the 27 EU countries would allow separate deals for sectors such as the car industry, as the Prime Minister has said she wants, Rogers said they would instead prioritise the integrity of the single market.\nTony Blair: Brexit is not inevitable He said: “The unity of the 27 will win out and I think she and others will agree there will be no sectoral deals in either the single market or the customs union.”\nHe said the free trade agreement approach was probably the best one given the circumstances, but he explained it would have to be “the biggest free-trade agreement ever” struck with the bloc, covering goods, tariffs, financial and professional services.\nRead more Brexit: IoD advises preparing for worst as Juncker touts €60bn bill Brexit uncertainty fails to dampen UK start-up ambitions EastEnders under fire for 'anti-Brexit' episode Sir Ivan said the consequences of the UK securing no deal and relying on WTO rules would be “nuts” and like falling off the \"cliff edge\" into a \"legal void\".\nLiberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael, who sits on the Brexit Committee, said: “It’s clear no free trade deal with the EU could ever be better than remaining in the single market.\n“Theresa May and her Brexiteers are living in la la land. They are promising special deals to key sectors that are unlikely to ever be delivered.” \nLabour MP Phil Wilson, leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign, said: “The Government needs to do their homework, forget about a cherry-picking sectoral deal, and come up with a trade agreement that can match their promises.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:29:22.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
