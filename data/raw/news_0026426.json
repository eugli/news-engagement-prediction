Â© 2017 by The Dolph Briscoe Center for American History, published by the University of Texas Press, of the former first lady came out in January.\nFor six years, Hillary Clinton barely noticed his unobtrusive presence, reported the Financial Times.\nOnly a handful of people spent as many hours in close proximity to the Clintons as Robert McNeely, who spent six years with the family as the White House photographer\nFamily: Chelsea smiles as her mother wearing dark sunglasses hugs her husband in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room\nAnother showed Clinton's clear enjoyment of the celebrity glamour that comes with the first lady role.

Taken in the first few days of the Clinton presidency, this photo represents the high spirits and hopes of the early months, February 16, 1993\nHe said: 'Hillary Clinton is an intensely private person - she gives away so little. If she weren't in politics, she could be a world-class poker player.'\nShe has admitted before in speeches that she prefers the 'service' part of public service, compared with the public aspect which she has referred to as a 'necessary evil'. And in that way, it is hard to think of two politicians more different than Hillary and her husband.\nMcNeely described the former president as someone who craves attention, while his wife does not care if people like her or not, reported the Financial Times.\nReturning to the White House with Chelsea Clinton through the Diplomatic Reception Room, July 13, 1998.

This photo also broke a 200 year precedent of a First Lady holding a political position while her husband remained in the White House\nA close family friend to the Clintons', Vince Foster, had just taken his life following revelations over the Clintons' failed Whitewater property deal. The first lady attempted to stop a firestorm, but it backfired. Whitewater led to the appointment of Starr as special prosecutor, whose investigations eventually led to the semen-stained dress of a White House intern.\nAnother image shows Clinton standing in the Roosevelt Room near her husband, seated with aides. Mandy Grunwald and Michael Sheehan are both in the frame. They were working on her healthcare reform bill, whose demise in 1994 triggered the second-biggest crisis of the Clinton years.\nThe photo shatters a 200-year precedent, as Clinton was the first first lady to take charge of a serious policy initiative, and it was her husband's top priority, reported the Financial Times.\n'After Hillarycare failed, she did not sink into gloom, as Bill was prone to do at times,' said McNeely. 'She divided into the next project with the same workaholic zeal. Nobody should underestimate how tough she is. There aren't many men like her.'\nA moment of levity between Hillary Clinton and vice-president Al Gore (at right) in the Oval Office, as President Clinton speaks with aides in 1994\nOne photo shows Clinton listening on the edge of a presidential huddle on a MD80 plane during her husband's 1996 re-election campaign.
