He said the footage shows the women were never physically assaulted and disputes their claims that they were the only black patrons there. \n\"There was no racism,\" he said. \"There was no assault at the Blufin Sushi bar.\" \nRelated: Kaffer: It's time to speak up about racism in Flint water crisis \nTaNisha Prater and her friends Adrienne Savage and Kimberly Hudson said they went on a monthly girls’ night out gathering at Blufin Sushi on Saturday. The women said they were sitting at the bar when a manager asked them to give up their seats for other customers who wanted to sit at the bar. \nPrater, owner of the Thrift on the Avenue store in Detroit's Midtown, said that she and her friends looked around and realized “we were the only African-American patrons at the time.” \n“We asked why did she ask for us to relinquish our seat,\" Prater said, adding that the manager did not answer. Prater said they hadn't yet finished their drinks. \n“I believe it’s because were African American,” Prater said she told the manager, who Prater said responded: “That’s it, I’m done talking with you,” and said she was calling the police. \nPrater said she later asked other employees at Blufin for one of the manager’s business cards and began posting on Facebook Live about what was happening. She said the manager tried to snatch the card out of her hands and ushered her out of the restaurant. \nThe friends said they posted about their experience on social media to send a message against discriminatory treatment. Prater said she filed a police complaint against the manager alleging assault. \nChief Daniel Jensen, director of Public Safety for Grosse Pointe Farms, did not return a message seeking comment today. \nDraper said the women had been at Blufin's bar for more than two hours and had finished eating and drinking when the manager asked them to move to another area with stools lined up along a wall under a narrow counter \nThe footage, which has no audio, shows the manager walking by and talking to the women, who appear to have glasses of water in front of them. One woman leaves. Soon after, the other two walk to the host stand and apparently ask to speak to a manager, who turns out to be the same person who asked them to move.

It was only at that point that the women were asked to leave because they were disturbing other customers, Draper said. \nOther footage shows the manager outside on the phone with police while a woman appears to be recording footage with her cell phone. \nDraper pointed out other black patrons sitting at tables in the restaurant, refuting Prater's claim that she and her friends were the only black people there. \n\"The credibility is not there,\" Draper said. \nA protest was planned for tonight outside Blufin, which is closed. Draper said police asked the owner to keep the restaurant closed today because of the planned protest. \n\"The restaurant has lost a lot of money,\" and so have its workers, because of the allegations, Draper said. \nDraper also said: \"They were asked to move within the bar to a place where they could go have a cocktail, continue to drink. But we needed to open up a place (at the bar) where people could eat. ... The place was absolutely packed.\" \nDraper said another patron, a white woman, called police to say she had also been asked to relocate on Saturday night because the restaurant was crowded. \n\"We welcome all customers at Blufin,\" Draper said. \nContact staff writer Ann Zaniewski: 313-222-6594 or azaniewski@freepress.com.
