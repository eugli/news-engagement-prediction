Therefore, I direct the bureau to return to its previous approach,\" Sessions said in a letter dated Tuesday to Thomas Kane, acting director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\nShares of the two leading U.S. private prison companies gained in after hours trading, with GEO Group up 2.15 percent and CoreCivic up 3.44 percent.\nThirteen of the federal government's 146 prisons are privately run. Together, those 13 housed 22,600 inmates as of December 2015, down from about 40,000 in 2014.\nThe Bureau of Prisons began contracting with private companies in 1997 at a time of severe prison over-crowding.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:24:16.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
