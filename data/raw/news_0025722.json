Unlike most summits between world leaders, no one really knows what the two men will say to each other or what direction their conversations will take; and the uncertainty swirling around the outcome of their discourse has Ottawa on edge. \nREAD MORE: Trudeau, Trump to meet with female CEOs to discuss women in workforce \nThe two have talked on the phone a couple of times since Trump won last year’s presidential election. But the prime minister has steered clear of directly commenting on some of Trump’s controversial statements and actions, such as the ban on travellers from seven Muslim majority countries. \nLast week, Trudeau said he would be respectful in broaching areas where the two men disagree, and he pointed out there are issues where he sees eye-to-eye with Trump, such as creating jobs for the middle class. \nThe federal Liberals have also indicated they are willing to re-negotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, responding to a campaign promise by Trump to ditch the current accord. However, the scope and timing of the talks remain far from clear. \n“I am counting on having a good working, constructive relationship with the president,” Trudeau said last week in Yellowknife. \nREAD MORE: Trudeau meets Trump: How past PMs have dealt with unpopular U.S. presidents \nNo doubt the prime minister of Australia had the same goal, but Trump lashed out at Malcolm Turnbull over an immigration matter during their first phone conversation earlier this month. Trump cut the call short. \nRelations with Mexico are also frayed, with Trump persisting with plans to build a wall between the two countries to keep out unwanted migrants. \nJapan, on the other hand, is likely breathing a sigh of relief after a meeting between Shinzo Abe and Trump – followed by a weekend of golf at Trump’s palatial home in Florida – went off without any major incident. \nIn Canada, the Opposition leader has offered to lend Trudeau a hand in dealing with the Trump administration. \nREAD MORE: Justin Trudeau expected to push for open border in Donald Trump meeting \nInterim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose sent the prime minister a letter over the weekend proposing they work together on a bipartisan basis to build a relationship. \nShe noted that members of her caucus have forged strong contacts with American lawmakers and some also have experience in trade issues, a crucial area given Trump’s plan to renegotiate NAFTA. \nNDP Leader Tom Mulcair, however, has criticized Trudeau for not being more strident. \nVIDEO: Trudeau says he’ll defend Canadian values in meeting with Trump ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:46:27.621+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
