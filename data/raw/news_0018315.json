He’s done an unbelievable job.” \nAs was always likely to be the case, Arsenal Fan TV have hit back at the former Manchester United defender via Twitter. \nArsenal are very much in contention to secure a top-four finish this season, although the race for automatic Champions League qualification is sure to be hotly contested with only five points separating second and sixth position. \nThe Gunners also still alive this year’s competition with a trip to Bayern Munich in the first leg of their round of 16 tie looming on 15 February. \nHowever, it would seem supporters are just about fed up with failing to go all the way in the biggest competitions on offer. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
