Now Ormewood Park wants in on the action. For a theme, they’re fixing to celebrate all things handmade. With a hat tip to homegrown music. Originally planned to debut last October, Ormewood Park’s “Meet The Makers Festival” is now set in stone for nine hours on Saturday, March 25, organizers tell Curbed Atlanta. Ormewood Park, tucked between Grant Park and East Atlanta, used to host an annual festival years ago, and this reinvented street fest is an effort to highlight the neighborhood’s leafy lanes as well as local wares. \"It's our intention ... to not only bring back the festival and draw attention to the neighborhood that we love so much, but to offer a festival that enhances life experiences and the concept of being home,\" Hannah Thompson, Ormewood Park Social Chair, told Curbed last year. Expect the usual ATL festival fare—beer (from Eventide Brewing), food trucks, an artists market, kiddie area, and live music performances—plus more than 20 local makers, from hobbyists to professionals, extending their hands-on wisdom. OrmewoodPark.org Workshops (ranging from $8 to $45) will cover everything from woodworking, cupcake decorating, chicken cooping, and scavenger hunting to a session led by Tiny Doors Atlanta artist Karen Anderson on how to build a minuscule succulent garden. The folksy, rootsy, and pop-rock musical lineup includes a band named in homage to the neighborhood—The Ormewoods—comprised of Grammy-winning producer and musician Don McCollister and Claire Pearson, Atlanta Intown Songwriter founder. Sounds like a lively kickoff to Atlanta’s spring festival season.
