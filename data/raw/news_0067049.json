Photograph: Clemens Bilan/EPA \nIn a country where meat is often an emotive matter and your preferred choice of sausage can be more revealing of your origins than your accent, it was nothing less than a quiet revolution. \nWith a general election looming in September, some politicians decided to interpret the initiative as a coup against carnivores, a politicised attempt to introduce a vegetarian nanny state by stealth. Telling porkies: German MP attacks vegetarian products with meaty names Read more \nChristian Schmidt, Germany’s food minister and a member of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), immediately hit back at the environment minister, Barbara Hendricks, an MP for the centre-left Social Democratic party. He said: “With us there won’t be a veggie day through the back door. Instead of paternalism and ideology I stand for variety and freedom of choice.” \nBefore the last German elections in 2013, during a campaign in which parties struggled to set themselves apart on weightier political issues, the Green party had proposed a weekly “ veggie day ” on which canteens across the country would not be serving meat — a policy proposal that backfired spectacularly and was blamed by many for the party gaining only 8.5% at the election . \nWhether the German public remains similarly concerned about its lunchtime currywurst in the age of Brexit and Trump remains unclear, but so far Hendricks has been waiting in vain for an emphatic endorsement of her initiative from other government departments. \nOut of the 14 other ministries that make up the German government, 12, including Angela Merkel’s chancellery and other departments run by Hendricks’s Social Democrats, confirmed to the Guardian on Friday that they were not planning on cutting meat and fish from their menu. Only the country’s development ministry stated that it had asked its catering team to “significantly reduce the amount of meat and fish in their menus”. \nEven the Green party has been lukewarm about the environment ministry’s plans. “I think it’s right to regulate the production, not the consumption of meat,” said Anton Hofreiter, a former co-chair of the German Greens. \nIn his recently published book Fleischfabrik Deutschland (“Meat Factory Germany”), Hofreiter argues that since the 1990s Germany has started to produce more and more meat, even though people in the country have started to consume less. To make up the difference, he says, farmers have started exporting abroad en masse and pushing down on workers’ pay and standards. \n“No one would have problems with with stricter regulations around mass livestock farming, but we shouldn’t make the mistake to prescribe a lifestyle to people,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T08:11:59.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
