PHOTO GALLERY \nBut the Indian fielders were also left feeling the heat as they dropped four catches. \nIshant Sharma finally clung on to a skier at long-off after Renshaw mistimed a hit off Jayant Yadav. \nSmith then steadied the innings with Mitchell Marsh as the duo tackled the spinners with aplomb. \nBut it was O'Keefe who stole the show earlier in the day with a blitz of wickets after lunch that saw India's middle and lower order crumble as the hosts conceded a 155-run first innings lead. \nO'Keefe went well past his previous best (3-53 against Pakistan at Sydney) in just the fifth match of his Test career. \nThe 32-year-old's stunning exploits put Australia in charge of the first match of the four-Test series but it was a day to forget for Indian captain Virat Kohli , who was dismissed for a rare duck. \nKohli, who has hit four double centuries since July last year, walked after just two deliveries for his first duck in a Test since playing against England in August 2014. \nPaceman Mitchell Starc, who had already made an impact with his gritty 61 in Australia's first innings score of 260, took two wickets including the prized scalp of Kohli. \nIndian opener Lokesh Rahul top-scored for the home side with a gritty 64 but hurt his shoulder while going for a mistimed heave at long-off and did not take field. \nThe number-two ranked Australia, who lost their last nine Tests in Asia, are looking for an upset win against the world's top side. \n-- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:56:28.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
