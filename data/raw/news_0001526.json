Koen Lenaerts, president of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), said he was certain that the notoriously meddlesome body would become involved in the process. The comments are likely to infuriate Theresa May who has pledged to leave the jurisdiction of the court as soon as possible. In an apparent rebuke of the Prime Minister’s declaration, the Belgian judge suggested that the court could even intervene in any trade deals struck between the UK and the EU after Brexit. Asked whether it was possible that the Luxembourg court could become involved in the departure, Mr Lenaerts said: ‘Yes, it is.’ He added: ‘It probably will, one day or another, end up on the docket of the Court – not because of the Court, but because of parties bringing the case.’ The role of the court is expected to be one of the most contentious issues when the UK takes to the negotiating table with the EU later this year. In her landmark speech setting out the UK’s position on Brexit last month, Mrs May specifically pledged to ‘take back control of our laws’ from the ECJ.
