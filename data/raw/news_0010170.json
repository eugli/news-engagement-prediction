Players took part in a fun game of shinny with some local youngsters at the Scarcello family rink after they were chosen the winner of the Moose Backyard Rink Contest. \n“This is amazing,” said contest winner Jeff Scarcello. “This is something we never dreamed of. We just like having it out there for the kids in the community and our kids to get out and skate. We never thought it would turn into something like this, so this is really special.” \nWATCH: Moose players play shinny on backyard rink \nRELATED: A dog’s best friend: Manitoba Moose Chase De Leo helps Winnipeg Humane Society \nMoose forwards Quinton Howden, Dan DeSalvo, and Darren Kramer and defenceman Kevin Czuczman all took a whirl on the outdoor ice and even their mascot Mick E.
