Deal with the Pels includes guard Buddy Hield, and a 2017 first-round pick to the Kings for Cousins, league sources tell @TheVertical . \n— Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) February 20, 2017 Sources: New Orleans is also sending the Kings a 2017 second-round pick (via Philadelphia) and Tyreke Evans in deal, league sources said. \n— Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) February 20, 2017 The Pelicans are including guard Langston Galloway in deal to the Kings, who'll likely be waived, league sources tell @TheVertical . \n— Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) February 20, 2017 Sacramento is sending forward Omri Casspi to New Orleans in DeMarcus Cousins trade, league sources tell @TheVertical \n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 20, 2017 \nCousins is averaging 27.8 points and 10.6 rebounds per game this season. He was a Western Conference reserve in Sunday’s NBA All-Star Game, which was in New Orleans. \nThe acquisition of Cousins allows the Pelicans to move Davis — one of the league’s best players — to power forward, which is his natural position. \nNew Orleans is 2.5 games behind the Denver Nuggets for the eighth and final playoff spot in the West. The Pelicans have reached the playoffs only once in the last five seasons. \nThumbnail photo via Jerome Miron/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:42:18.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
