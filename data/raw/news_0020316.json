Live November Jobs Report: Everything You Need to Know Last Updated Dec 2, 2016 at 9:54 am ET \nLive analysis of the employment figures released by the Labor Department Friday. SHARE \nCanadian Job Market Shows Some Slack \nEconomists React: ‘Paves the Way for Fed Rate Hikes’ \nInflation Bets Dial Back in Treasurys \nU.S. Stocks Open Slightly Down \nWages Are Not Benefiting From Low Unemployment Rate See only Highlights Canadian Job Market Shows Some Slack \nMeanwhile, north of the border, Canada just announced that it added a net 10,700 jobs last month, the fourth-straight month of gains. \nBut those Americans who crashed Canada's immigration website on Election Night should note: There still appears to be sizable slack in the country's labor market. \nAll the job gains were part time, hourly wages were up just 1.4% from a year ago, and the overall jobless rate is at 6.8%. Erik Holm Twitter Inflation Bets Dial Back in Treasurys \nThe inflation trade is taking a break on the decline in wage pressure. But the pullback is mild, a sign many investors haven't been swayed in their beliefs about higher inflation given the prospect of fiscal stimulus, rising oil and solid jobs growth. \nThe 10-year break-even rate is at 1.97 percentage points, versus yesterday's 1.982, which was the highest close since September 2014, according to Tradeweb. The rate has soared from a summer low of 1.36. Some analysts say the buy-TIPS-sell-Treasurys trade may be crowded. Min Zeng Twitter U.S. Stocks Open Slightly Down \nThe opening bell has rung, and U.S. stocks begiun the seesion ever-so-slightly down. Just after the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is off 19 points to 19173 and the S&P 500 is down less than 1 point to 2191. Erik Holm Twitter Wages Are Not Benefiting From Low Unemployment Rate \nWhat is probably most surprising about those weak wage trends is that the unemployment rate would seem to imply that wages should be rising at a far stronger pace. \nEverybody keeps saying that the tighter labor market should lead to rising wages. And they're right, but it isn't happening. \nAs you've no doubt read by now, the unemployment rate fell to its lowest point since August 2007. Wage growth, however, is nowhere near its rate from then. \nAverage hourly earnings in November were up about 2.5% from a year ago, and weekly wages were up about 2%. In August 2007, both hourly and weekly wages were up 3.9% from a year ago. \nThe economy is, therefore, still a very long way away from producing the kinds of wage trends that would signal a truly healthy market. Paul Vigna Twitter Full-Time Jobs Have Been the Engine \nNearly all of the positions added since the last recession ended in June 2009 have been full-time jobs. Facebook Twitter Weekly Wages Increase Just 2% \nAverage hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory employees, a group that comprises 80% of the overall work force, rose 2.35% in November from a year ago, to $21.73 from $21.23. That isn't exactly great. \nIf you look at the weekly earnings - which I'd say are a better indication of how people actually live - it gets even worse. Average weekly earnings were $730.13 in November, up from $715.45 a year ago. That works out to a 2.05% increase. \nWith inflation these days running about 1.5% or so, that means the average worker's wages are barely outpacing inflation. Paul Vigna Twitter Four Rate Hikes Could Be Coming Next Year \nWhile some say the Federal Reserve won't be able to lift rates aggressively next year, others say fiscal stimulus enacted by the new presidential administration might change the equation. \nHere's Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics with that view: \n\"A December rate hike is coming and, assuming that we see a major fiscal stimulus passed in the first half of next year, we expect an additional 100 basis points of tightening from the Fed next year, taking the fed funds target range to between 1.50% and 1.75% by end-2017.\" Ben Eisen Twitter Doubts About 2017 Rate-Hike Pace \nShaun Osborne, chief foreign-exchange strategist at Scotiabank, said the report confirms the Federal Reserve’s case for raising U.S. interest rates this month, but raises some doubts that the Fed will be able to tighten policy aggressively in 2017. \n”The Fed is locked in at this point for a December increase,” said Mr. Osborne. But the argument for more rate increases next year “would have been sounder if we’d seen a pickup in hourly earnings,” he said. Chelsey Dulaney Twitter Dollar Edges Up After Jobs Report \nThe U.S. dollar is slightly higher after the report, holding onto its recent bout of strength over the past month. \nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against 16 peers, is up 0.04% on the day, though it remains below the multi-year highs seen at the end of last month. The dollar is up 0.3% against the Japanese yen, and the euro slid about the same against the dollar. \nA strong dollar has been one factor that's constrained the flow of money in the past, causing Fed officials to think twice before lifting rates. This time around, despite the financial tightening created by a rising currency, most believe it won't stop the central bank from moving this month. Ben Eisen Twitter Report Gives Fed Reason to Be 'Measured' in 2017 \nGary Pollack, head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank's private-wealth-management unit, is surprised at November's pullback in average hourly earnings. \n\"Wage inflation remains muted even as the labor market is tighter, which is a positive for bonds,\" he says. Still, today's report won't stop the Fed this month--though \"it would support the Fed's stance to tighten in 2017 at a measured pace.\" \nMeanwhile, he calls the bond-price gains since the report hit a selling opportunity since the market's narrative has been shifting toward higher yields. Mr. Pollack has been selling long-term bonds and moving into shorter-term debt. He expects the 10-year yield--recently at 2.419%-- to rise to the 2.75-3.0% range next year. Min Zeng Twitter Forget the December Hike, It's Time to Think About 2017 \nWell, if you were still holding out, we'd really advise you not to bet against a Fed hike later this month. This morning's jobs report was the \"last hurdle\" to a hike, Aberdeen Asset Management's Luke Bartholomew said this morning, and it's \"incredibly hard\" to imagine what could keep a December hike from happening. The question now is what happens next year. \n\"For a long time markets have thought rates would rise very gradually,\" he wrote. \"But Trump’s victory has tested that conclusion. The Fed will want to offset any significant fiscal stimulus that Trump manages to enact. There’s a good chance that Trump might view that as an attempt to undermine his plan given how hostile he’s been towards the central bank. That could lead to a showdown between president and central bank which financial markets would not take kindly.” Paul Vigna Twitter Broader Measure of Unemployment Hits Lowest Since April 2008 \nThe U.S. labor market has been one of the brightest spots in a long recovery marked by sluggish growth. But even with consistent job creation, a historically large share of Americans have opted out of the workforce and wage gains have remained below prerecession levels. \nThat may be changing as the labor market gets tighter, forcing employers to cast wider nets for workers, and offer better pay and perks. But there are still signs of slack. \nA broad measure of unemployment and underemployment called \"U-6,\" which includes those who have stopped looking and those in part-time jobs who want full-time positions, was 9.3% in November, down from 9.5% the prior month and the lowest level since April 2008. The rate averaged 8.3% in the two years before the recession. Jeffrey Sparshott, Eric Morath Twitter Fed Rate Rise Expectations Still Intact \nAll told, investors are viewing this report as doing little to deter a rate increase by the Federal Reserve this month, which markets have largely priced into the market. \nTraders in the fed funds futures market, used to place bets on the timing of a rate rise, show a 95% chance of an increase in December, up from 93% on Thursday, according to CME Group.
