(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara) Steven Lemongello be coming to Central Florida this week?\nTrump has made few stops outside of Washington and Palm Beach since taking office, but one of them was a rally in Melbourne on Feb. 18. But there were conflicting reports Monday on whether Trump might be returning the area as soon as Friday. \nThe Palm Beach Post reported Monday that the Federal Aviation Administration is placing a “VIP Movement Notification” notice for Orlando on Friday, with flight restrictions similar to those in place for Palm Beach when Trump flies into town to stay at Mar-a-Lago. \n“Those restrictions have been a hallmark of Trump’s visits, but not of trips by Vice President Mike Pence ,” the Post reported. \nA spokesman with the FAA confirmed that a “VIP” was scheduled to come to Orlando Friday, but had no further information as to the person’s identity or the timing of any visit. \nA spokesman with Orlando International Airport, however, had no information about any possible visit. \nThe White House press office also declined to comment, and there was nothing scheduled on the Trump campaign site. \nLew Oliver, the chair of the Orange County Republican Executive Committee, said that he and Orange County Trump Campaign Chair Randy Ross hadn’t heard anything about a potential visit either. \nTrump has been scheduled to spend his fourth weekend out of five since his inauguration at Mar-a-Lago — and Orlando would be a convenient stopover. \nCentral Florida has been a popular destination for Trump. \nHis one rally in Florida during his post-election “Thank You Tour” was at the Central Florida Fairgrounds in Orlando — despite Orange County going overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in the November election. \nTrump flew Air Force One from Palm Beach to Melbourne and back on Feb. 18, pulling up to a hangar holding 9,000 people despite initially denying the plane would be used as a “prop.” \nslemongello@orlandosentinel.com, 407-418-5920 or @stevelemongello \nTrump defends his actions in office during campaign rally in Melbourne » Caption Former U.S Representative Alan Grayson on restoring ex-felon voting rights \nTalking to former U.S Rep.
