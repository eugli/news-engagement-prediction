"  MORE ON THAT LOBBYING BAN: The political law experts at Wiley Rein point out President Donald Trump 's lobbying ban exempts “communicating or appearing with regard to” agency rulemaking, adjudication, and licensing proceedings.\nStory Continued Below\n\"Thus, it appears that President   would prohibit 'lobbying activities' by alumni appointees of his administration, even if such activities comprise background, behind-the-scenes activities and fall below the LDA’s registration thresholds,\" Robert Walker and Eric Wang wrote . \"On the other hand, the Obama executive order did not exempt lobbying on agency rulemaking, adjudication, or licensing proceedings.\"\n— Trump's ban probably won't deter lobbyists from joining the administration, Megan Wilson reports for The Hill. “I have talked to a number of people who are seeking advice on whether or not to join the administration, and the ethical obligations have not been a determining factor,” said Ivan Adler, a headhunter at The McCormick Group . \nA MODEST PROPOSAL from The McCormick Group's John Hesse for \"outcome tracking for government relations\": Lobbyists should disclose all their activity from retainer to result, letting everyone see exactly what they did and what they achieved. And lobbying should be defined broadly to include \"any activity that furthers the self-interested public policy goal of a client or person/corporation.\"\nHesse elaborates: \"For example: Exxon retains firm ABC to lobby on Arctic drilling rights. My idea is that firm ABC would have to file upon retainer and throughout the process noting the issue and results achieved. Then finally, firm ABC would have to report on the end result of activity. Did Exxon win or lose? Right now we assume lobbying terminations are failures or successes but we have to guess which one is correct.\n\"If we knew results publicly, we could measure effectiveness and transparently see exactly how influence works or does not work. We could also tell which firms were effective and then journalists could investigate why. Again we assume because lobbyist are paid they are effective at something but we don’t really know. The public does not know that firm ABC got language inserted into XYZ conference report that benefited Widget company unless someone does a whole lot of research. It should be easier. I think then lobbyists and the public would grow to trust one another over time.\"\nTAKING STOCK: The researchers at Delve size up the fallout from Trump's week of using executive orders as \"souped-up press release[s]\": \"Continuing these run-and-gun tactics with regards to executive action will have serious long-term consequences, which will occur when the president seeks support on the Hill for his nominees and policy agenda,\" they wrote in their Administration Project newsletter tracking the transition. \"Even if key Republicans in Congress are not consulted on the content of executive actions, failing to loop them in prior to the documents’ release leads to poor messaging overall. The President is about to announce a Supreme Court nominee and a litany of other nominations he will need help from Congressional leadership to shepherd through, and this stumble in the relationship between either end of Pennsylvania Avenue could put constraints on that help.\"\nTHANKS FOR THE MEMORIES .

More and more law and lobbying firms are adding comms practices. Irion will work with the firm's lawyers and add his own staff.\n\"Our strategic communications initiative is part of our broader effort to ensure we can provide complete solutions to our clients’ problems,\" CEO Steve Immelt said. \"Increasingly, successful strategies for resolving complex matters involve the ability to communicate effectively in the public arena as well as in legal proceedings. In this digital age public perceptions form rapidly and can determine the ultimate outcomes of our clients’ legal strategies, which makes it imperative that we help shape the public narrative in order to achieve a successful outcome.”\nDEM DONORS: The Democracy Alliance hired former White House Public Engagement Senior Associate Director Archana Sahgal, signaling the Democratic donor group's commitment to resisting Trump.
