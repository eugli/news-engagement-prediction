But his name became infamous in the state of Michigan, on June 2, 2010, when he served as first-base umpire during Galarraga's start against the Cleveland Indians. \nWith two outs in the ninth inning and a perfect game on the line, Cleveland's Jason Donald hit a ground ball toward the gap between first and second base. First baseman Miguel Cabrera ran toward the ball, grabbed it and threw to Galarraga covering first. \nDonald was out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:18:38.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
