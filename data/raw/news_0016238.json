Shapovalov was stunned after accidentally hitting Gabas in the eye \nAn emotional Shapovalov, who was playing in only his second Davis Cup tie, said: \"I feel incredibly ashamed and embarrassed and I just feel awful for letting my team down, for letting my country down, for acting in a way that Iwould never want to act. \n\"I can promise that's the last time I will do anything like that. I'm going to learn from this and try to move past it.\" \nBritain moved through to a quarter-final meeting with France in April. \nClick the video above to watch how this Davis Cup tie ended in the most bizarre of fashions...
