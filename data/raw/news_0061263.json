Photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler \nMANILA, Philippines – From her affair with her driver and her alleged links to the illegal drug trade, Senator Leila de Lima has faced a slew of controversies in recent months. While the vocal critic of President Rodrigo Duterte slams the accusations against her as political persecution, government officials claim there is damning evidence that she facilitated – and benefited from – the proliferation of illegal drugs   back when she was justice secretary. Convicted inmates testified against her during House inquiries, claiming De Lima received millions in payoffs that helped fund her successful 2016 senatorial bid. Aside from her alleged drug links, De Lima's character has been questioned because of her affair with her former driver, Ronnie Dayan, her alleged bagman for drug payoffs.
