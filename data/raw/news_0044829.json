By Nicholas Kamm/Getty Images. After a rickety first month on the job—one that involved a botched immigration executive order; a constitutional crisis; numerous Cabinet appointment snafus; “Flynngazi”; Nordstrom-gate; and the fading distinction between Sean Spicer and Melissa McCarthy — Donald Trump had pined for some R&R. Incoming presidents have frequently lusted for a chance to escape the bubble of isolation that they experience in the White House. But no one has traveled as prodigiously, or expensively, as Trump, who spent his third consecutive weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his club in Palm Beach. According to The Washington Post , these trips have probably cost taxpayers around $10 million . Trump often castigated Obama as a frequent traveler who spent too much time on the golf course. But, as Think Progress notes , the travel budget from Trump’s first month is about equal to what Obama spent in his first year. In the process of converting Mar-a-Lago into the “Winter White House,” as it has now been semi-officially branded, Trump has essentially eschewed the more proximate Camp David. The woodsy retreat, which is only some 60 miles away from Washington, D.C., is rooted in its own history. Winston Churchill once described it as “in principle a log cabin, with all modern improvements,” according to The Washington Post . Franklin Roosevelt transformed it seven decades ago. President Jimmy Carter famously struck a peace deal there between Israel and Egypt. President Clinton unsuccessfully tried to broker one between Israeli and Palestinian leaders. President George W. Bush hunkered down after the 9/11 attacks, and used it as a couples retreat to host Tony and Cherie Blair. Camp David has provided generations of presidents an opportunity to escape the swamp, but the rural retreat can, in many ways, mirror the bare-bones seclusion that presidents have felt in the Oval Office. (Harry Truman told his pals it was, among other things, boring.) Many presidents understood how to use the isolation to their advantage. Carter, for example, recognized that not every world leader wants to hike in the woods and be one with nature, making it an easy choice to get down to work and get out of there. “The claustrophobic feeling there really helped the negotiations,” a Carter aide told the Post . “They had to get a deal.” These virtues, however, appear physically and psychologically revolting to Trump. The 70-year-old is such a creature of habit that he would often fly home from campaign stops so that he could spend the night in his New York City triplex. He is a man who likes to be surrounded by the familiar, and that familiar tends to be gilded, heavily draped, and in some of the most expensive zip codes that happen to be at the center of society action. None of that is true of Camp David, which is perhaps why the retreat isn’t his cup of tea. “Camp David is very rustic. It’s nice. You’d like it,” Trump told a European journalist last month. “You know how long you’d like it? For about 30 minutes.” His dismissal of Camp David is not just a matter of taste, though it is very clear that Trump would prefer to play golf on one of his courses than tend to a stamp collection, like Roosevelt, or trot around on a horse like Ronald Reagan did. Trump’s club, instead, allows his narcissism free rein; it’s like a campaign rally, but with rich people replacing frustrated, disenfranchised voters. Mar-a-Lao, indeed, prides itself on its open access to the president. When Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe visited the United States earlier this month, they traveled to Mar-a-Lago and spent the weekend putting at Trump-owned golf courses, greeting a bride and groom who have paid Trump “a fortune,” and dining on the Palm Beach club’s terrace, amid its members who have paid six figures for a front-row seat from which to watch global diplomacy at its highest level play out. When news of North Korea test-firing a missile broke while Trump and Abe dipped into their wedge salads on the Mar-a-Lago terrace, a member documented their discussions on Facebook, detailing their demeanor and posting photos of what appeared to be the nuclear football on the social network. Of course, there are issues with Trump’s preference to be closer to his standard of retreatment. Mar-a-Lago is not nearly as secure as Camp David, which is vacant and shielded from prying news media. Trump’s dinner-table diplomacy was concerning enough that House Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz asked the White House to detail how it planned to deal with such security issues and how members were vetted. There is also the problem of a president profiting off of the power of his office. Mar-a-Lago is owned by the Trump Organization, a company the president stepped down from once he took office but still owns and financially benefits from. It also doubled its initiation fee to $200,000 three weeks before Trump was sworn in. According to The New York Times , at least three members are being considered for ambassador posts, and much of the rest of the member list is stacked with Wall Streeters, energy executives, and real-estate bigwigs, all of whom could benefit from the president’s policies and could enjoy close enough proximity to him to bend his ear. Taxpayers aren’t the only ones paying for his constant presence at Mar-a-Lago, either. According to Times , the town has had to shell out $60,000 a day to pay overtime to sheriff’s deputies, tallying up to about $1.5 million since the election. Local businesses, particularly those centered around the airport, have also suffered, since Secret Service grounds flights for security reasons when the president is in town. The newspaper reported that 250 private flights have been grounded every day, and the local airport has lost $200,000 in fuel sales in one single visit this month. Businesses that offer banner advertising, parachute jumping, and helicopter tours have been grounded. One sightseeing company canceled nearly two dozen tours and turned away another dozen walk-ins, and one flight school company told the Times it had to miss out on $14,000 worth of business. This might be hard to square for a president who campaigned on creating jobs and spurring the economy, particularly for small businesses—stomping out local businesses so that he could enjoy some weekly relaxation in the comforts of his own ritzy resort. But these trips are doing just fine for one small business—the Trump Organization. The company, now run by his two sons, is enjoying a nonstop branding blitz as the president traverses from one Trump golf course to the next. Memberships that offer the chance to witness history and glad hand with a sitting president and his top aides almost seem like a bargain for businesspeople, even if they are doubled in price. He certainly wouldn’t see that kind of boon from Camp David. Those woods, then, are likely to remain extra quiet.
