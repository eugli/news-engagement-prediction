John Corina.\nThe two officers were taken to UC Irvine Medical Center, where one officer was pronounced dead, Corina said. The other wounded officer is in stable condition.\nThe wounded suspect is a gang member who is known to police, Corina said. He was taken to County-USC Medical Center and his condition is unknown.\nThe suspect had been involved in a traffic accident with another vehicle near Colima Road and Mar Vista Street, and approached the driver he had rear-ended to help push his silver car off to the side of the road around the corner.\nWhen officers arrived, the driver that who was struck pointed them to the location of the other vehicle, where they encountered the heavily tattooed suspect.\n\"He started firing at the officers and they returned fire,\" Corina said. \"We are still looking into that, why he just opened fire.\"\nEmergency responders at the scene performed CPR on a male officer while wheeling him into an ambulance, said Brian Feinzimer, a freelance photojournalist who was at the scene as authorities responded Monday morning.\nAlso visible in the eastbound lanes of Mar Vista Street east of Colima Road was a Whittier police SUV with shattered windows and a suspect who was handcuffed facedown on the pavement, Feinzimer said.\nThe Whittier Police Department has about 128 sworn officers who police the cities of Whittier and Santa Fe Springs in southeastern Los Angeles County.\nSunday afternoon, a procession of police vehicles traveled from the Orange hospital carrying the slain officer to the Orange County coroner's office. They cars were greeted by a line of law enforcement officers who saluted as the procession drove by.\nSunday's shooting marks the third time a police officer in Whittier was slain in the line of duty. According to the Officer Down website, Whittier officers were killed in 1977 and 1979.\nÂ© Katie Falkenberg/Los Angeles Times/TNS Members of the Whittier Police Department investigate the scene of an officer-involved shooting in the area of Mar Vista Street and Colima Road Monday, Feb. 20, 2017 in Whittier, Calif.
