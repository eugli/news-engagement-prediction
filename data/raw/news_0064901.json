The actress might have gotten a head start over her peers thanks to dad Jon Voight, who brought her en famille twice, first in 1986 and again in 1988, but it was Jolie who came into her own in 2000. Having snatched Oscar gold for her role in Girl , Interrupted , Jolie accepted the coveted statuette in a formfitting goth-y frock from Marc Bouwer. Then a year later, Jolie played with androgynous dressing in Dolce & Gabbana’s sinewy snow-white tuxedo punctuated with vintage jewelry. This mind-set carried over to 2004, when again in white, Jolie slipped into one of Bouwer’s modern takes on classic Hollywood style. She channeled Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe, and her plunging V-neck satin dress was a vision—one that catapulted the actress into sartorial superstar status. But a few years later, in 2009, Jolie decided to take a more sculptural tack, opting for Elie Saab’s couture strapless frock. Lifting the moment to A-list heights were OTT emeralds and a nod to grand dame style with an updo. However, it was three years later that the Oscars red carpet witnessed its most daring moment when Jolie bared her right leg in Versace’s showstopping strapless dress. A bold red lip, tousled tresses, and peep-toe shoes completed the image of a modern-day movie star, and it was a look that inspired countless memes and prompted stars across the globe to try their hand at replicating the style. For her most recent Oscars appearance, in 2014, Jolie sought to usher in the new look of Hollywood elegance by donning a shimmering, heavily embellished frock from Elie Saab Couture. Keeping her makeup light, she amped up the sparkle effect with dazzling diamond drop earrings, while a sheer underlay hinted at skin. With her latest film effort, First They Killed My Father , the subject of much Oscar buzz, here’s hoping Jolie will once again dazzle red carpet watchers everywhere.
