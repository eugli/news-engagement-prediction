Florence Masebe slams Mzansi's 'obsession' with international artists \n\"Circumcision reduces the risk of contracting HIV by 60% as well as other sexually transmitted infections. Some men do it because it keeps the penis clean, and others because their partners prefer it, but whatever the reason, it’s the right thing to do,\" he said. \nThe actor's wife Liza will be at the clinic to support her man through the procedure. Kagiso explained that he wanted to debunk myths surrounding circumcision. Ambitiouz Entertainment heads to court over artist saga \nThis was also part of the reason why he wasn't already circumcised. When he was younger, a doctor told him that his foreskin was too small. \n\"A doctor told me my foreskin was too small which turned out to be nonsense. Then there were the usual issues: I was nervous about the pain, the healing period and abstaining from sex.\" \nThe actor has since done research and discovered that there is more discomfort than pain. \n\"You can’t have sex or masturbate for six weeks afterwards, but I’ve timed it to be totally healed by my birthday.\" \nTo book a place at one of the 150 clinics in Gauteng, KZN, Mpumpalanga and the North West send a 'please call me' to 082 808 6152.
