(AP) \nCalifornia Senate Democrats moved Tuesday to become the first “sanctuary state,” advancing bills that would create a statewide sanctuary for illegal immigrants, provide money to pay lawyers for immigrants facing deportation and hamper any attempts by the Trump administration to create a Muslim registry. \nThe move comes days after President Trump launched his crackdown on immigration and sanctuary cities across the nation. \nSan Francisco filed a lawsuit against Trump earlier Tuesday, claiming his executive order that would cut funding from sanctuary cities is unconstitutional and a “severe invasion of San Francisco’s sovereignty.” \nSan Francisco receives about $1.2 billion a year in federal funding for services that include housing, health and social services, and homelessness. \nIn Sacramento, Democrats on the state Senate Public Safety Committee voted along party lines to prohibit state and local law enforcement from cooperating with customs agents \n\"We want to make sure that police officers don't abandon their beat and go enforce immigration laws,\" said Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon of Los Angeles, author of the statewide sanctuary measure. \nRepublicans and law enforcement groups said the bill would make it harder for authorities to work together to fight crime. \n\"I think this bill is making it that much more difficult for the federal authorities to get the most dangerous criminals that we want to deport to keep our communities safe,\" said Sen. Jeff Stone, a Temecula Republican who voted against the measure. \nWe the People Rising, a group which favors strict immigration laws, came out against the bill. The Mercury News reported that the California Police Chiefs Association and the Peace Officers Research Association of California have not commented on the legislation \nHours after the sanctuary legislation advanced, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved two other measures that take direct aim at Trump's policies. \nIn another party-line vote, Democrats backed legislation to provide an unspecified amount of money for lawyers to represent people facing deportation. \nThe committee also passed a bill prohibiting state and local government officials from assisting in the creation of a possible Muslim registry. Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, said he wrote the bill in response to statements by Trump during his presidential campaign.
