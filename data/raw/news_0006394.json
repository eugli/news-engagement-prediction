Featured on the sophomore album Culture , Quavo, Offset and Takeoff‚Äôs breakout hit also introduced a new design aesthetic that seemed sleeker and stranger than the grandiose work of their previous efforts. \nThe guy responsible for the work, Stole ‚ÄúMoab‚Äù Stojmenov, is a 20-year-old Italian graphic designer whose first big project stateside was the cover for Westside Gunn‚Äôs There‚Äôs God And There‚Äôs Flygod, Praise Both . \nHaving grown up drawing comic book characters and listening to his father play everything from jazz to heavy metal, Moab mentions loving the link between album covers and the music they went with. He was 16 by the time he discovered Hip Hop, spraying graffiti wherever he could before blending in his appreciation for baroque art.

He saw some of my works on Instagram and asked to work together. We started working on some singles that were on streaming on SoundCloud when Culture wasn‚Äôt planned yet and we took some time to find the perfect balance between my artworks and the music until September when Migos announced their second official album and Quavo introduced me to the 300 Entertainment and Quality Control team, with whom I worked for the complete design of the album.

What exactly were you guys trying to achieve aesthetically? \nMoab: Well, the only guidelines Quavo gave me were about what I had to symbolize on the cover. We had to represent Migos‚Äô past but also, what they gave to Hip Hop culture, Atlanta and how they stepped up the rap game. Aesthetically, I had complete authority on the work. Quavo trusted me and since our first works together, he liked my vision and my way of doing things. I wanted to condense all the different and various images Quavo gave me in one single powerful image. At the same time, I didn‚Äôt want it to seem chaotic and difficult to understand. I think Culture is a very important step in Migos‚Äô career and musical production. We needed to represent this and make clear that they contributed a lot to the improvement of American rap and Hip Hop culture.

The artworks of Culture and ‚ÄúBad and Boujee‚Äù are very different because of that. In fact, it was featured later in the album and became its first official single in October when it was released on Apple Music, iTunes, etc. We decided to keep the first cover but, of course, it helped find the balance between artwork and music at the beginning of our collaboration even though the following covers were totally different.

Culture is already a classic everywhere, I mean, whoever likes the genre has to love this album. In this particular case, Culture had a great media impact here because of my collaboration too. People had the chance to appreciate the project even more.
