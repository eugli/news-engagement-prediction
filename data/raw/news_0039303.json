Now the Reserve Bank has released the new tenner. \nSome commenters suggested the fiver “looks like vomit” while others pondered, simply: “What even is that?” \nThe new design kept the same basic colours and size but importantly incorporated a new “tactile” feature to help the vision-impaired distinguish between currency. \nOn Friday, the Reserve Bank pushed out its specimen for the new $10 note, one that includes the “familiar faces” of Banjo Patterson and Dame Mary Gilmore, though it must be said the latter is looking more serious in the rejigged edition. \nGovernor Philip Lowe said it was important to keep familiar faces on the banknote and that Patterson and Gilmore deserved their place inside Australia’s wallets. Banjo is back. Source: Twitter More of Mary. Source: Twitter \n“Their work is recognised in several design elements on the banknote, including images of a pen nib in two of the clear windows and excerpts of their poetry in microprint.” \nOne of Patterson’s poems is carried on the neck of his collar. There’s some wildlife too, for those who are interested in that sort of thing. \n“Each banknote in the new series will feature a different species of native Australian wattle and bird. The $10 banknote features the Bramble Wattle (Acacia victoriae) and the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo (Cacatua galerita),” Mr Lowe said. \nThe new notes won’t be issued until September, so don’t throw your old ones out just yet. \nMore to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:21:36.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
