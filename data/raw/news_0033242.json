We do not know his identity,\" Abdul said. \nKim Jong Nam was born from his father's non-marital relationship with South Korea-born actress Sung Hae-rim who died in Moscow, according to Yonhap. \nOnce considered the heir apparent, he fell out of favour with his father following a botched attempt in 2001 to enter Japan on a forged passport and visit Disneyland. He has since lived in virtual exile, mainly in the Chinese territory of Macau. \nKim Jong Un took over as North Korean leader when his father died in December 2011. Kim Jong Nam, known as an advocate of reform in the North, once told a Japanese newspaper that he opposed his country's dynastic power transfers. \nIf confirmed, Kim's case would be the highest-profile death under the Kim Jong Un regime since the execution of the leader's uncle Jang Song Thaek in December 2013. - CNA/Agencies/rw/nc ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:21:07.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
