While six seasons of a television show and two subsequent movies should, honestly, be enough, true enthusiasts of the show are still secretly hoping that Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda will make one more appearance on the big screen. Even Parker herself agrees. When speaking with Marie Claire at a New York Fashion Week event, Parker—who played Carrie Bradshaw, the show's protagonist and narrator—explained that she would definitely consider getting the old gang back together for a third film. \n\"It's in a warming drawer. It's never been a 'no'...it's always been an 'if' and 'when,'\" she told the magazine. \"And that remains the question being asked by two very thoughtful people who are taking into very serious consideration those people who devoted a lot of time. We're not cavalier about the way we arrive at that decision.\" So even though there's no official word regarding the film, it's exciting to hear that Parker would consider the possibility—because without Carrie, there's no Sex and the City . \nThis is not the first time Parker has teased turning the films into a trilogy. Back in September, Parker told the Press Association that the option will always be on the table. \"I think that remains an open question and discussion that will continue until it's been resolved,\" she said. \"I don’t think any of us have said no...I think that’s always a possibility, definitely.\" \nParker clearly still feels extremely connected to Bradshaw , who was a huge lover of designer shoes. The actress even started a shoe line called SJP by Sarah Jessica Parker. The brand's first brick-and-mortar shop opened in Washington, D.C.— gasp , not New York City—in December. If Sex and the City 3 really does happen, do you think Carrie will sport a pair of SJPs on screen?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:17:00.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
