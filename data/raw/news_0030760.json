I thought it was better to stay in the European Union than not.” Reformist Speaker John Bercow places himself in eye of another storm Read more \nIn the video, obtained by the Sunday Telegraph , Bercow said that immigration had been good for Britain \nHe also referred to “untruths” during the Brexit campaign, when “promises were made that could not be kept”, and said he hoped parliament would maintain changes to working hours and health and safety protections after Brexit. \nBercow was already facing a vote of no confidence after branding the US president, Donald Trump, “racist and sexist” , effectively banning him from addressing parliament during his state visit. Some Conservative MPs say his position as Speaker is no longer tenable. \nLidington told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “There will be strong reaction among some MPs to what he said at Reading, particularly after what he said about the state visit earlier in the week. Ultimately, the Speaker has to command the confidence of the House of Commons as a whole. \n“John has his very strong supporters as well as his strong critics in the House of Commons, but we shall have to see how members as a whole respond. \n“It is really important for the very independence of the Speaker’s office that the Speaker, whether they start as a Conservative MP, a Labour MP, or whatever, is independent of government. Speakers, if anything, should be towards the people who are not in government, as, actually John Bercow probably has done in the way that he has used urgent questions that we have found inconvenient.” \nThe parliamentary website states: “The Speaker is the chief officer and highest authority of the House of Commons and must remain politically impartial at all times. \n“On election the new Speaker must resign from their political party and remain separate from political issues even in retirement.” \nBercow’s spokeswoman said that how the Speaker cast his ballot in the Brexit vote had no impact on his ability to deal fairly with all MPs. \nShe said: “Mr Bercow voted in the EU referendum, along with millions of others. The record shows that he has rigorously facilitated the raising of concerns of those on both sides of this argument, as he does on every other issue. \n“The Speaker’s impartiality is required on matters of debate before the House, and he has been scrupulous in ensuring that both sides of the argument are always heard.” \nThe spokeswoman said Bercow’s record showed he was neutral in the chamber “irrespective of how he voted in a referendum, general [election] – one would hope for himself – local [election], or Strictly Come Dancing”. \nJames Duddridge is among the Tory MPs saying it was now impossible for Bercow to be impartial during Brexit debates in the Commons.
