February 19, 2017 | 08:43AM PT \n“ The Lego Batman Movie ” is dominating the North American box office with an estimated $44 million this President’s Day weekend — nearly matching the combined haul of “ Fifty Shades Darker ” and “ The Great Wall .” \nUniversal’s second weekend of “Fifty Shades” is heading for $24 million at 3,714 sites and its action-fantasy “The Great Wall” was projected to wind up with $21 million at 3,325 locations for the Friday-Monday period. Lionsgate’s second weekend of “John Wick: Chapter 2” is finishing in a solid fourth place with $19.5 million at 3,113 venues as holdovers propped up the holiday weekend business. \nNew Line’s opening of high school comedy “ Fist Fight ” showed only a modest punch in fifth with around $14 million at 3,185 locations.

Still, the number isn’t particularly impressive, given the $150 million budget for the Legendary production — the most expensive movie ever shot in China. \nMatt Damon stars as a European mercenary joining the fight against monsters during China’s Song Dynasty. \nMore to come… ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T18:44:36.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
