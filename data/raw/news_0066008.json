This week we got to see it get air one more time, in real life, in the middle of Detroit. \nOn Friday, stunt man Raymond Kohn got behind the wheel of this specially-prepared jump-ready “General Lee” Charger and hit a five-foot ramp at about 55 mph to soar “25 feet or so into the air” and come down “134 feet later,” according to the Detroit Free Press .
