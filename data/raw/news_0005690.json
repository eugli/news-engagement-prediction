Rick Larsen introduced legislation aimed at banning the captivity of orca whales.\nLarsen, 51, is cosponsoring the Orca Responsibility and Care Advancement (ORCA) Act, which would \"permanently end orca captivity across the United States and prohibit orca breeding, the wild capture of orcas, and the import or export of orcas for purposes of public display.\"\n\"Orcas are an iconic and beloved part of Pacific Northwest culture,\" Larsen said in a press release. \"Passing the ORCA Act will ensure future generations of orcas stay where they belong: in the wild, not in captivity.\"\nLarsen is the Democratic representative of Washington's 2nd district, which runs along the coast from Edmonds to Bellingham and includes the San Juan Islands as well as Whidbey, Camano and Fidalgo Islands. He successfully fought to designate San Juan Islands National Monument in 2013.\nThis diver was swimming off the coast of Tromso, in northern Norway, when they encountered quite a sight. A pod of orca whales went swimming past. According to the experienced diver, they were on the hunt for some herring in the fjords.
