In a Facebook post Saturday, Jordan described that night’s Wal-Mart run as “another dreaded shopping trip trying to buy groceries for a family of 5.”\n“We literally dread going to Walmart and buying groceries period because my husband’s whole check goes to food for our family,” she wrote, adding, “I will say that I’m not a fan of shopping at Walmart because of how rude some of the people can be.”\nBut this trip was different.\nWhile most of the time, Jordan wrote, cashiers don’t interact with customers, Dasant was “very friendly” and engaging.\n“[Dasant] told me my total and I was digging through my wallet trying to count all of my money out,” the stressed shopper recounted. “She gave me a smile and said, ‘You guys look like you need a blessing tonight.’ I just smiled back.”\nIn the moment, Jordan probably thought nothing of the exchange. But seconds later, Dasant offered up that “blessing” — something the Wal-Mart cashier said was inspired by a voice inside her.\n“As we’re scanning and scanning, she got in front of me and it’s like I saw a different face on her,” Dasant told WLTX. “And I just had like a little man on my shoulder that was like, ‘Give her a $100 dollars, give her $100.’ And I was like, ‘give her $100?’ Like, I’m talking to myself like, ‘Give her $100!'”\nThe cashier walked around the register and told Jordan: “God told me to give you $100 dollars.”\nAt first, Jordan misunderstood, thinking Dasant was just giving them a coupon. “I then looked at the total, and I was at a loss for words,” Jordan wrote. “This sweet woman whom I never met in my life paid for half of my groceries!”\nJordan was so moved by the encounter, she asked if she could take a photo with the cashier and share it on social media. At press time, Jordan’s post had been liked nearly 30,000 times and shared more than 7,000 times.\nBecause of Dasant’s friendly gesture, Jordan wrote, she and her husband “both knew things were going to be OK because there truly are good people out there.”\n“Thank you so much Sharnique Dasant,” she added, “you truly are a blessing and you will never realize how much you helped us out and how much faith you have put back into our heart.”", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fproudmom1113%2Fposts%2F1030132827091968&width=500", "http://www.wltx.com/news/local/cashier-says-god-told-her-to-help-pay-for-familys-groceries/409759539", "http://interactive.tegna-media.com/video/embed/embed.html?id=2515849&type=video&title=Faith"], "published": "2017-02-22T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:24:13.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
