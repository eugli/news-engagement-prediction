DAVID WALKER/FAIRFAX NZ \nMitchell Berry, 15, left, can't believe hitting a hole in one on the first green. Joe Piggott, middle, and Amelia Garvey, right, congratulate him. \n\"You couldn't have scripted a better start,\" club chairman Mike Cross said. \nREAD MORE: \nBerry, Joe Piggott and Amelia Garvey were the lucky trio to walk the fairways with Sir Bob and while the 80-year-old may not have won the first hole, he won the round, hitting 73. DAVID WALKER/FAIRFAX NZ \nA large gallery followed as Sir Bob Charles around the Kaiapoi Gold Club. \nBerry, who has only been playing for 12 months, scored 74, as did Piggott, and Garvey had 75 playing off the white tees. \n\"They did the club proud,\" Cross said. \n\"They were a bit nervous for obvious reasons. They were playing with a legend and in front of a big crowd. DAVID WALKER/FAIRFAX NZ \nAmelia Garvey shares a laugh with Sir Bob Charles. \n\"Joe said said to me 'it will probably be the biggest crowd I ever play in front of\" but they all played well.\" \nWhether they make it it big or not, they will never forget their round with Sir Bob. \nAnd Sir Bob may never forget the time a 15-year-old showed him up off the first tee. \nThe left-hander last played the Kaiapoi course 60 years ago when he was still an amateur, playing for Christchurch in the Woodward Cup. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:34:56.321+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
