The bird was so badly hurt, vets could not save it.\nInvestigators are appealing to the public for any information on the incident.\nIt is very distressing to think that people take pleasure in causing harm to these beautiful and defenseless birds. These are deliberate acts of cruelty and we would appeal to people’s consciences not to commit these offences.\n– Lee Stewart, RSPCA Last updated Sat 25 Feb 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:21:41.252+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
