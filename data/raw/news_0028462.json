Drizzy sent Chano some celebratory texts, after the Chicago rapper won his first Grammy ever for \"Best Rap Performance\" for \"No Problem (Feat. Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz ).\" Chance took a screenshot of Drake's texts, and posted it triumphantly on IG. \nChance will be performing tonight at the Grammy Awards, but Drizzy is out in Europe on tour and thusly cannot attend. Drake has already picked up two awards for \"Hotline Bling,\" however. \nCheck out Chance's Instagram post below, and stay up to date on who is winning Grammys tonight right here .
