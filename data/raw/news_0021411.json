It is illegal to license such exports if there is a “clear risk” they could be used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law. Over a year ago, a leaked UN report recorded “widespread and systematic” breaches of the laws of war . This week has exposed the indefensibility of weapons sales so clearly that the need for a suspension seems undeniable, except to the government.\nFirst, the United Nations warned that 12 million Yemenis are on the brink of famine , while 19 million – more than two-thirds of the population – need assistance and protection. An already impoverished country has been devastated by a conflict fuelled by arms sales and political and military support from the UK, the US and others. The UN seeks $2.1bn to stave off the worst, while the UK alone has licensed more than £3.3bn of arms sales since the war began almost two years ago. Earlier hopes of a peace deal have faded and the US suspension of some exports to Riyadh – a token gesture by the departing Obama administration – is likely to be overturned by the new regime in Washington.\nMeanwhile, a judicial review of British sales brought by the Campaign Against Arms Trade has revealed deep concerns within government. Edward Bell, head of the Export Control Organisation, wrote that “my gut tells me we should suspend [the exports]” . Liam Fox, usually a doughty defender of arms sales to the Middle East, deferred a decision on further licences after a bombing killed 140 people at a funeral in October and was condemned by UN monitors. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, conceded that the issue was “finely balanced” – but pressed him to proceed.\nThe Saudi-led coalition is supporting an internationally recognised president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who was driven out by Houthi rebels allying with the predecessor ousted in the Arab spring. Tehran’s backing of the Houthis, the extent of which is far from clear, sucked Riyadh into an expensive war because of their rivalry .\nThe British government’s lawyer told the high court that one needed to be “jolly careful” in reaching judgments of violations of human rights law by friendly nations. He warned of the danger of interfering “with the interests – if not rights” of exporters and of the risk to diplomatic relations. Britain, and Saudi Arabia’s other friends, are concerned about arms sales, their long-term strategic relationship with Riyadh, and intelligence cooperation and Iranian ambitions in the region. London also has a speedy post-Brexit trade deal with the Gulf Cooperation Council in mind – so why antagonise Riyadh?\nThe answer is simple. Saudi Arabian airstrikes have hit hospitals, weddings and schools; on the very kindest judgment they are reckless. In many cases they appear to have been deliberate. Britain’s complicity in breaches of international law damages its influence and soft power and further degrades international standards just when they most need to be upheld. Yemen’s suffering will exacerbate regional instability. A ruling may be weeks or months away: ministers should stop sales now. The “interests” of arms exporters cannot outweigh Yemenis’ right to life.", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-un-idUSKBN15N14Q", "http://www.ibtauris.com/books/humanities/history/regional%20%20national%20history/asian%20history/middle%20eastern%20history/saudi%20arabia%20and%20iran%20soft%20power%20rivalry%20in%20the%20middle%20east"], "published": "2017-02-11T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:23:17.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
