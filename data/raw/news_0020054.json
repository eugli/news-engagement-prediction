One such player could finally make the move in the summer. \nWhen Zlatan Ibrahimovic moved to PSG it kind of felt like he'd decided to take the easy way out rather than ever move to England and join the Premier League. \nHowever in the summer he finally fulfilled a destiny that seemed like it wouldn't get fulfilled when he moved to Manchester United, and it's going pretty well so far. \nAnother player who has been linked to United in the past could finally make his move to the North West of England, however it now looks like it'll be to Manchester City. \nPortugal midfielder William Carvalho has spent years being linked with a move to Old Trafford but now he's signed up with Pep Guardiola's brother's agency and people think that means a move to City is coming. Sporting midfielder William Carvalho has swapped agents: from Jorge Mendes to the brother of Man City manager Pep Guardiola, Pere.

As well as the rumours with United and City he's previously been linked to Liverpool and Arsenal too. \nThe 24 year old was part of the Portugal squad who won the European Championships last summer in France and he's long been thought as one of the best defensive midfielders around. \nCheck out our video on transfers that never happened: \nThe Sporting midfielder is thought to have a release clause of £35 million and that's how much Pep Guardiola's team would be expected to pay. \nGuardiola has used Yaya Toure as his most defensive midfielder in recent times so it wouldn't be a huge surprise to seem him strengthen in that area of the pitch in the summer. \nWill Carvalho move to the Etihad?
