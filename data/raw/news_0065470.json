Investigators in Bentonville, Arkansas, found an Amazon Echo in Bates’ kitchen, and issued a warrant for all of its recordings and data during a 48-hour period from Nov. 21-22. \nAmazon explained it had complied with some of the search warrant’s demands by providing subscriber information and purchase history, but did not release any of the requested recordings or transcripts. \nThe retailer wrote a 91-page argument against the warrant saying both requests and responses from Alexa contain details about its users' behaviors and interests, and therefore deserved protection from the government. \nThose requests are protected by the First Amendment, and the search warrant would “chill users” from using their Echos in fear the government could obtain whatever they request, according to the document. The massive online retailer told Vocativ last December that it “objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.” \nThe company did say it would comply if presented with a heightened burden of proof for why recordings may be needed for a case. \nBates pleaded not guilty. A hearing date has not been set on Amazon's motion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:48:40.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
