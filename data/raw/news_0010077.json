Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA benefits cheat who claimed to be a single mum was caught out when she posted on Facebook: \"I love my husband he's the bestest\" \nElizabeth Hughes falsely claimed £32,000 before she was caught, the Daily Record reports. \nShe has been jailed for eight months but none of the money has so far been reclaimed. \nHughes told the Department for Work and Pensions she had broken up with husband Arthur in January 2010. \nShe kept up her lie until 2013 when she told them they had reconciled. \nBut in reality, they had been living as husband and wife under the same roof the entire time – with Hughes raking in tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money over the three-year period. Investigators said posts like this helped prove Hughes had been lying \nChildminder Hughes claimed she had struggled with financial issues and used the cash to cover debts. \nBut investigators found debits from her bank accounts to travel firms and Facebook images of her with her husband and children on foreign holidays. \nFiscal depute Vicki Bell told Dundee Sheriff Court: “There was also a post on Facebook saying he was ‘the bestest husband’ posted during the period of the claim that she was single. \n“Her husband was interviewed and initially said they had separated in 2009 but only reconciled late in 2012. \n“But at the end of the interview, he said they had only separated for three or four months in 2009. \n“He admitted he knew the accused had made a single person’s tax credit claim. \n“A total of £32,000 was overpaid and no money has been repaid.” \nHughes, 36, of Dundee, pled guilty to a charge under the Tax Credits Act. \nSheriff Alastair Carmichael jailed her for eight months.
