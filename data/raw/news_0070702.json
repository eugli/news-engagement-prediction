She believes this “private crime” needs to become everybody’s business. \nMs Lewkowicz made headlines in 2013 when her photo essay Photographer as Witness: A Portrait of Domestic Violence, a stunning and shocking documentation of a violent fight between an Ohio couple, Shane, 31, and his girlfriend Maggie, 19, was published in Time magazine. [News.com.au has published all the images below]. \nThe photos were taken on a night in November 2012, when the couple and Maggie’s two children, Kayden, 4, and Memphis, 2, from a previous relationship, were staying at a friend’s house. Shane continued to scream in Maggie's face as Memphis wedged herself between them. At some point, the toddler had stopped crying and began trying to soothe her weeping mother. Picture: Sara Naomi Lewkowicz Source: Supplied When Maggie refused to go anywhere alone with him, Shane began grabbing her by the face and neck, choking her. \"You can either get beat up here, or we can go talk alone,\" he said. \"Your choice.\" Picture: Sara Naomi Lewkowicz Source: Supplied \nAs they had many times before, Shane and Maggie began to fight. He had previously pulled her hair and grabbed her beck, but that night was different. He attacked Maggie, throwing her into chairs, pushing her up against a wall and choking her in front of her daughter. \n“After I confirmed one of the housemates had called the police, I then continued to document the abuse — my instincts as a photojournalist began kicking in. If Maggie couldn’t leave, neither could I,” Ms Lewkowicz wrote in her essay. \nAs the police arrived and Shane was arrested, she kept taking photos. He later pleaded guilty to a domestic violence charge and is currently in prison in Ohio. \n“Women need to understand this can happen to them. I never thought it could happen to me, but it could,” Maggie told Sara. \n“Shane was like a fast car. When you’re driving it, you think ‘I might get pulled over and get a ticket.’ You never think that you’re going to crash.” As Shane and Maggie continued to fight, Memphis ran into the room and refused to leave Maggie's side. Picture: Sara Naomi Lewkowic Source: Supplied After a night out at a local bar, Maggie left after becoming jealous of another woman flirting with Shane. Upon arriving home, Shane flew into a rage, angry that Maggie had \"abandoned him\" at the bar, and he screamed that Maggie had betrayed him, at one point accusing his friend (not pictured) of trying to pursue her sexually. Picture: Sara Naomi Lewkowicz Source: Supplied \nSpeaking to news.com.au, Ms Lewkowicz said Maggie is now in a new relationship and moved to Alaska to start a new life. \n“We try to talk fairly regularly, but she has another baby now and she’s going to college. She doesn’t want to just be known as an abuse survivor,” she said. \nIt’s a positive end to an abusive relationship which we don’t often hear about. Despite this, the Time magazine article earned Ms Lewkowicz both praise and criticism. \nSome argued she started a brutally honest conversation about the reality of domestic violence. Others said she was capitalising on someone else’s misery for her own artistic benefit. \nThe questions came thick and fast —“Why didn’t you try to stop him? How could you take photos of something like this? Why did you just stand there?” Maggie cried as a police officer tried to keep her separated from Shane and coax out the truth about the assault. Picture: Sara Naomi Lewkowicz Source: Supplied An officer from the Lancaster Police Department photographed Maggie's injuries. When Maggie expressed hesitation about filing an order of protection, the officer told her, \"You know, he's not going to stop. They never stop. They usually stop when they kill you.\" Picture: Sara Naomi Lewkowicz Source: Supplied \nBut Ms Lewkowicz says she did intervene, by getting a friend to call the police, and says she would do the same thing over again. \n“I’m not going to argue with people any more about my actions that night. I stand by them and frankly [Maggie] stood by them and she said I did the right thing. For sure, I would do the same thing again. I called the police and took the pictures,” she said. \n“A lot of people said ‘How could you take the pictures?’ But if you look at the pictures and feel upset, then you need to think about why you’re more angry at the photos than the fact that this actually happened to someone. \n“That shit was going to happen whether I was there or not. He’s abused multiple women he’s been with. This is habitual; this is not a one off. I prefer to have been there to be like ‘This is what abuse looks like. It’s really ugly and disturbing’. Figure out why you’re so disturbed by it.” Maggie sat on the bathroom floor and cried after arguing with Zane. Picture: Sara Naomi Lewkowicz Source: Supplied Overwhelmed by her nerves and the shock of the abuse she suffered, Maggie became sick to her stomach. Picture: Sara Naomi Lewkowicz Source: Supplied \nIn Australia, at least one woman a week, on average, is killed by her partner. One in four Australian women will experience physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner, and one in four will experienced emotional abuse by a current or former partner. \nThey are shocking statistics that speak to how common misogyny is all over the world, Ms Lewkowicz says. Fixing our global domestic violence problem starts with fixing how men and women relate to each other. \n“It starts with the small stuff. It’s not just teaching girls how to avoid physical and sexual abuse, but teaching boys that you don’t have a right to a woman’s body, you don’t have the right to force a woman to do anything. You’re not entitled to her,” she said. \n“If you’re fighting with your girlfriend, you’re not allowed to block her from leaving the room. Our idea of masculinity is defined by how efficiently can [men] dominate your environment? It’s defined by ‘Do you have control over all the things in your life?’‘Don’t show emotion unless it’s anger’. All those behaviours are toxic for men and they’re toxic for women. They’re just not good for anybody. \n“It’s been pretty unbelievable to see how often that stuff goes down and how many people suffer.” Shane pleaded with Maggie not to let the police take him into custody, crying out, \"Please, Maggie, I love you, don't let them take me, tell them I didn't do this!\" Picture: Sara Naomi Lewkowicz Source: Supplied Maggie put Kayden and Memphis into their car seats to take them to her best friend's house for the night after Shane was arrested. Picture: Sara Naomi Lewkowicz Source: Supplied Maggie watched her children play on a swing set near her home. She was seven months pregnant with the child of her current boyfriend, Tyler.
