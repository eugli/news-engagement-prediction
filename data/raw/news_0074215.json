The glitz and glamour of the Academy Awards will attract a phenomenal TV audience, inspiring young actors who hope that they will one day be a star. And all those celebrities treading the red carpet on Sunday evening were themselves young, starry-eyed hopefuls. So to give you a little pre-Oscars test, we've raided the stars' photo albums and found photographs of them as children. See how many of the 16 you can recognise... Scroll down for the answer. One of these two might have been touted as having a Mickey Mouse career once, but critics are dancing for both of them in their latest roles One was once known as a queen, now a First Lady but the other became the Iron Lady. Their angelic faces may look a little different on the red carpet now On the left at the tender age of 11, this girl became a star and made James Bond history with her role. On the right, this loud mouthed young child went on to use his voice for freedom On the left, a young girl known as a great Australian actress, once in a film named after the country she called home. Right, a childhood dream was realised as this little boy played at being Spiderman On the left, this young lad felt comfortable in his Red Sox kit as a boy, and his latest film could also have easily featured the colour.

On the right, nominated much less, but he finally stammered to victory in 2011 This mop-haired cutie was a rabbit caught in the headlights when he fought off competition for his Best Actor award more than 15 years ago. Right, as a baby, he had a long way to go to master the poker face that would help him win his biggest award RELATED ARTICLES", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:06:38.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
