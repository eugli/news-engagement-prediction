This is not just a matter of product safety and people who have been sold faulty goods – this is a matter of negligence on a massive scale by a major corporation. ‘This is not only something that civil lawyers, but also possibly the police should be looking into.’ The Labour MP for Hammersmith, Andy Slaughter, condemned the delay in telling people to stop using the dryers Whirlpool estimates that 3.8 million of the machines were in use when it issued the safety alert in 2015. It says 1.5 million families have registered to have their dryers fixed and 1.3 million of the machines have been modified. Using its figures, as many as 2.3 million dryers which are fire risks could be sitting in people’s homes. Mr Slaughter said: ‘What are people supposed to do? Many people can’t put washing out on a line. They will have to take everything to the laundrette, which costs money. The question is, are they going to get compensated for this?’ The MP said Whirlpool seemed to have managed the problem to ensure it cost as little as possible. ‘If you sell something that is clearly defective and dangerous then you should just replace it, no questions asked, or give a full refund,’ he added. ‘If it was a few thousand machines, they would probably have done just that, but because it is millions they don’t want to do it for commercial reasons.’ The consumer group Which? has been instrumental in forcing Whirlpool to warn customers against using its faulty machines. Spokesman Alex Neill said: ‘There are millions of potentially dangerous tumble dryers that are out there in people’s homes. Consumers have been badly let down by Whirlpool’s handling of the ongoing safety issue and we are urgently calling for a full product recall of all affected machines.’ The UK system for handling the recall of faulty and dangerous products falls way behind the way the US deals with the issue. Consumer champion Lynn Faulds Wood carried out a review of the Government’s recall system which was published a year ago, but ministers have failed to act on her recommendations. Q&A BY VICTORIA BISCHOFF What has happened? Whirlpool, the maker of Hotpoint and Indesit tumble dryers, has admitted that millions of its machines are not safe to use and should be unplugged. Hundreds of families have reported fires linked to faulty machines sold under the Hotpoint, Indesit, Creda, Swan and Proline brands. What is wrong with the dryers? Excess fluff from clothes is coming into contact with the machines’ heating elements. In some cases this causes machines to burst in flames. Which machines are affected? Customers who bought a Hotpoint, Creda, Proline, Swan or Indesit dryer between April 2004 and October 2015 are at risk. Some 5.3 million machines are affected and there are thought to have been 750 fires since 2004. Why didn’t Whirlpool act sooner? The firm issued a safety warning in November 2015, telling customers that machines may need to be repaired or replaced. It said the dryers could still be used and it would send out engineers to fix the faults. But just 1.3 million have so far been repaired. So what’s changed? Customers had been told that if they cleaned the lint filter after each cycle and never left their machine unattended they could continue to use them. Now Whirlpool has decided the dryers are not safe to use after all and should be turned off until fixed. It was been forced to update its guidance by Peterborough Trading Standards, after consumer group Which? demanded a judicial review of the handling of the fiasco. What should customers do? Look for a green sticker on the dryer door or back of the machine. If there is a green dot, it is safe to use. If there isn’t a green sticker, go to the Hotpoint or Indesit website (safety.hotpoint.eu or safety.indesit.eu) to register the machine for a free repair. Customers without a computer can call 0800 151 0905. Once registered an engineer will arrange a visit to fix the machine, which will take about an hour. However the wait for an appointment can be anything up to a year. What if I don’t want a repair? Whirlpool is offering free repairs but won’t replace the machine. Customers can ask for an upgrade to a newer model but there will be a cost. More than 45,000 customers have signed a petition calling on the Government to force Whirlpool to recall all faulty machines. If it receives 100,000 signatures, the petition will be debated in Parliament. Can I get compensation? There is no official compensation scheme. Some law firms are offering to help customers sue Whirlpool if they have had a fire. What are my consumer rights? Which? says customers can ask for a free replacement from the retailer which sold them the dryer in the first place. The Sale of Goods Act 1979 – which was in force when the dryers were sold – states that products must be of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose. Customers can also ask for a refund, but the retailer is allowed to make deductions to cover wear and tear. Another option is to apply for a refund from your credit card provider, which is jointly liable with the retailer if something goes wrong with a purchase. She called for the establishment of a national product safety agency, or ‘centre of excellence’, to co-ordinate the system. She also recommended funding, training and resources for Trading Standards, which has been decimated by funding cuts. Yesterday, she condemned the lack of action by ministers, tweeting: ‘They could implement my Independent Review into Recalls: gathering dust on a shelf somewhere.’ A Whirlpool spokesman said no fatalities or injuries had been attributed to the faulty dryers. He said: ‘We are now very close to having provided resolutions for all those customers who have registered so far.’ The Whirlpool dryer at the centre of a flat blaze that killed two men Two men were killed by a fire caused by a Whirlpool tumble dryer in a flat in 2014. A pre-inquest hearing into the deaths of Bernard Hender, 19, and Doug McTavish, 39, heard that the pair died in the fire in Llanrwst, Conwy, in the early hours of October 10, 2014. A second hearing was told the dryer was a Whirlpool TVM570. Three other incidents have involved the same model between 2010 and May 2016, the US company’s head of global product safety admitted, but they did not result in any injury. Garry Lloyd Jones was the only survivor of the fire which killed his partner Mr Hender and business partner Mr McTavish. A pre-inquest hearing into the deaths of Bernard Hender (left), 19, and Doug McTavish (right), 39, heard that the pair died in the fire in Llanrwst, Conwy, in the early hours of October 10, 2014 He told the pre-inquest hearing that Whirlpool had not disclosed everything with regards to the dryers, adding that numerous incidents had occurred over a period of years. Mr Lloyd Jones said: ‘We know there are more fires out there caused by these models. There must be more fatalities caused by them but not recorded by the authorities that way. It’s been going on for years.’ A full inquest into the deaths has not yet been held. In another case, property designer Dennis Marinakis asked a Whirlpool engineer to come to his home and fix his dryer. Incredibly, hours later, the machine burst into flames. Mr Marinakis, 54, from south-east London, said he could have been killed by the blaze because he regularly put his dryer on before going to bed.
