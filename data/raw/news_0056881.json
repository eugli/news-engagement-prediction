Korean diplomat with good media relations Hot topic: Kang in the spotlight since the assassination of Jong-nam. \nKUALA LUMPUR: Embattled North Korean ambassador to Malaysia Kang Chol was his country’s first chief diplomat here who called on media organisations and invited journalists to his official receptions. \nLast year, the envoy made two visits to Menara Star, in January and later in March – both at his request. During the meetings, he seemed at ease talking about his country, which is nicknamed the Hermit Kingdom due to its isolationist policies. \nKang, who is comfortable speaking in English, described the test-firing of missiles by the North Korean regime as “normal”, and said Pyongyang was a beautiful city which welcomed tourists. \nWhen it was pointed out to him that it was unprecedented for a North Korean ambassador to be open with the media, he smiled and carried on with the conversation. \nAccording to his official biodata, the 64-year-old has two children and studied at the Pyongyang University of Foreign Language (1972-73) and Somalia National University (1973-76). \nHe began his diplomatic career as an assistant officer in the Middle East Department of North Korea’s Foreign Ministry. \nHe has been posted to Somalia and Ethiopia and also served as the ministry’s director-general of administrative affairs. \nOn Feb 13, the day Kim Jong-nam was murdered at KLIA2, the envoy hosted a reception in the evening to celebrate the birth anniversary of his nation’s founder Kim Il-sung at a North Korean restaurant in Jalan Kamuning, Imbi. \nAmong those on the invitation list were people he knew from the media.
