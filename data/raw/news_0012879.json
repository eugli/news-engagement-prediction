Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA mum-of-three was hospitalised after she claims a botched lip filler treatment caused her lips to swell up so she looked 'like Pete Burns ' - and her mum was sick when she saw her. \nLeona Omalley, 24, had undergone the procedure four times before at a clinic but decided to take advantage of a beautician's home visit service. \nThe full-time mum claims that the 'cheap deal' of £180 for 1ml of filler resulted in a trip to A&E after her lips swelled up 'like raw sausages'. \nLeona claims the beautician practised poor hygiene including not wearing gloves, carrying needles in a plastic bag instead of a sterile case, and using baby wipes instead of antiseptic wipes. \nShe also claims that she didn't go through the consent document with her fully. \nLeona, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, said: \"I looked like Pete Burns. It looked like there were two raw sausages tied together on my face. \n\"My mouth was stinging and it was really sore three hours later.

I experienced traumatic stress and had to be wrapped in a blanket - I was shivering, it was so scary. \n\"I was in hospital for six hours and put on steroids. I've never experienced anything like it - I thought I was stuck like that. She'd messed my whole face up. \n\"I cried and couldn't look in the mirror. I went to take a selfie and put my camera on, when I looked at myself and just thought 'what have I done?' I was heartbroken. \n\"At first I wasn't going to tell my mum because she never liked me doing it but then I had to. \n\"When my mum saw me she was heaving and being sick - my dad was really upset too. \n\"My boyfriend Gareth was really worried about me - he's always telling me not to do it. \n\"My children were traumatised by what they'd seen, especially my five-year-old daughter Lily. I've got two babies [Nellie, 18 months, and Tommy, 7 months] and I couldn't let them near my mouth.\" \nLeona had booked the procedure nine days before Christmas so she could flaunt a fuller pout over the festive season.

You don't search for fillers like you would a bargain in the sales. \n\"It's all about quality of product, quality of experience and training by a medical practitioner. \n\"There needs to be longer awareness, aftercare support and reaction of those patients with complications. \n\"They need to be able to deal with complications or be able to refer onwards in a very swift manner. \n\"These treatments should not be performed by non-medical people, they should not be performed by beauticians.\" \nFounder of the Safety In Beauty campaign, Antonia Mariconda, said: \"The campaign has become increasingly concerned at a number of public complaints relating to dermal lip fillers. Leona is now urging women to fully research before undergoing the needle (Photo: Ben Furst/Mercury Press) \n\"Our statistics indicate that four in five complaints made result in substandard treatments being carried out by inadequately-trained individuals who have no medical qualifications and are clearly unskilled and inexperienced at addressing complications.\" \nThe beautician who carried out Leona's procedure strenuously denied the allegations about poor hygiene. \nShe said: \"If I turned up with equipment in a carrier bag and didn't have gloves on why would she let me anywhere near her with a needle? \n\"She also sat and read the consent, why would she sign a document if she had no idea what it was about? It's absolute madness. \n\"I did not stab her or inject from one side only, that would have resulted in uneven lips. \n\"I left the numbing cream on until she was happy they were numb, I used anti-septic wipes on the area and afterwards I handed her a wet wipe for the area to get any little bits of blood from the injection sites. \n\"Her face didn't swell, just her lips - none of it is true.\" Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T14:47:51.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
