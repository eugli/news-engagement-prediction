Playing in Gurgaon on 17th March and in Pune on 19th March, the band will be supporting the cause of clean drinking water in many villages of Rajasthan. © Facebook Even though Mark Knopfler exited the iconic rock band ‘Dire Straits’, that was an essential part of the 80s music scene with hits like ‘Romeo & Juliet’, ‘Sultan of Swings’ and ‘Tunnel of Love’, in 1995, this upcoming concert will see two former members perform in India for the first time with their band. Nonetheless, this is still exciting news and a concert you definitely cannot miss. © Dire Straits Experience \nEven though you would have to wait a couple more days to get your hands on the tickets on Book My Show , it really is worth it as the concert is also for a good cause. A part of the ticket proceeds would be utilized in building water conservation structures in around seven villages in Rajasthan to provide clean drinking water, better sanitation and improved irrigation for the people. \nAn amazing concert with an even better cause. Well, see you there! \nPhoto: © Dire Straits Experience (Main Image)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:23:58.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
