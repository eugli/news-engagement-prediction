It was evident that it was having problems.” \nSo the two grabbed some tools, put on their ice skates and went to help the animal. \nUsing an axe, the rescuers chiseled out a route to the shoreline and directed the poor moose in that direction. After a little bit of a struggle, it finally found its bearings and took off into the woods.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:59:07.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
