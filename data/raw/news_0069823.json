Colmes leaves behind his wife, Jocelyn Crowley. \nBill Hemmer announced the sad news this morning on “America’s Newsroom,” which then aired a tribute package from Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity, his former co-host on “Hannity & Colmes.” \nIn a statement this morning, Hannity called Alan Colmes “one of life’s most decent, kind and wonderful people you’d ever want to meet.” \n“When Alan and I started ‘Hannity & Colmes,’ there wasn’t a day that went by where we didn’t say we were the two most fortunate men in all of television,” said Hannity. \nDespite their political differences, Hannity said the two “forged a deep friendship” over the years. “Alan, in the midst of great sickness and illness, showed the single greatest amount of courage I’ve ever seen,” he said. \nColmes was known for his electric commentary and for the fierce debates across Fox News programs since the channel’s launch in 1996. “Hannity & Colmes” debuted on Fox News in 1996 and ran until Jan. 2009. Colmes also hosted the nationally-syndicated “Alan Colmes Show” on Fox News Radio. He addressed his recent absence from the show in a note to listeners on Jan. 30. \n“As I previously mentioned on the show last year, there would be times I would be taking off from the show to deal with a medical issue. This is why I’ve been out recently and will be out this week as well. But I will be back taking your calls as soon as I can,” he wrote. \nColmes’ passing comes just days after the death of Fox News Channel’s Brenda Buttner, who died at age 55 after a battle with cancer. Neil Cavuto remembered the “Bulls & Bears” host on his show Monday. \nIn January, Colmes told his fans he was stepping away because of medical issues. \nFriends and colleagues are remembering Alan this morning on Twitter… So sad to hear of the death of Fox News colleague Alan Colmes. He and I agreed on little, but I liked him immensely. Good guy. R.I.P. \n— Brit Hume (@brithume) February 23, 2017 Very sad to report our friend and colleague @AlanColmes has passed away. \n— Shannon Bream (@ShannonBream) February 23, 2017 Just heard of death of Alan Colmes; the kind of liberal I loved-smart, witty, and fair; never backed up, but always backed up his views. RIP \n— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) February 23, 2017 Alan Colmes was a dear friend and I will miss him and our talks.We spoke every Thanksgiving and Christmas…RIP my friend @FoxNews \n— Michael Reagan (@ReaganWorld) February 23, 2017 Alan Colmes was always a gentleman…always kind…a wonderful colleague. pic.twitter.com/VxQimzE3bZ \n— Greta Van Susteren (@greta) February 23, 2017 \nRest in peace, Alan. Tarantula2 \nIt wasn’t suddenly. He was battling cancer and hasn’t looked well for a while now… Politically Incorrect Maurice Mitchelle \nI’ve made 104000 bucks in 2016 by working from my house and I was able to do it by w­o­r­k­i­n­g part-time for several hours every day.
