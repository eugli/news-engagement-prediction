They fall clearly within the so-called habitable zone. \nFurther data used in the Nature paper was collected from several ground telescopes around the world. \nDemory said that future telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, which is to succeed the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope, \"will have the possibility to detect the signature of ozone if this molecule is present in the atmosphere of one of these planets\". \nHe said that ozone \"could be an indicator for biological activity on the planet,\" but cautioned that signs of life are difficult to assert from interstellar distances. \n- dpa \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:26:21.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
