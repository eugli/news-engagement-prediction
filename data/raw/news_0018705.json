AP Photo/Laurent Ciprian \nFour people, including a 16-year-old girl, have been arrested in the south of France on suspicion of planning an attack in the French capital, Paris prosecutor's office said . \nThe four people were arrested in Montpellier on Friday morning by anti-terror investigators, M6 reports. \nThey were allegedly planning an attack with a suicide belt in a tourist hotspot in the French capital. \nA teenage girl, who was supposed to serve as a \"bait\" before detonating a suicide belt, was arrested. \nHer 21-year-old boyfriend was also arrested, both were reportedly known by the authorities for their connections with radical Islam and wish to travel to Syria. The other two suspects were 27 and 34. \nPolice discovered 71 grams of TATP, a powerful explosive — used during the November 13 Paris attacks and March 22 Brussels attack — when they raided the suspects' homes. The explosive is reportedly favoured by ISIS, but there is no evidence yet that the terror group is behind this latest plot. \nThey also found a laboratory set up to make the substance as well as one litre of acetone, hydrogen peroxide, and one litre of sulfuric acid — the three ingredients needed to make the explosive, BFMTV reports . \nThe arrest reportedly follows investigation on social media, which allowed the police to identify the four suspects. \nMore than 230 people have died in France in a series of Islamist militant attacks since the beginning of 2015. The country has been under a state of emergency rules since the November 2015 attacks that killed 130 people and injured hundreds more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T16:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T12:59:17.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
