It will not, however, be stopped,\" he wrote. \nThe 28-page letter made no mention of potential acquisitions. Last week, Berkshire-owned food giant Kraft Heinz ( KHC ) walked away from a bid to buy Unilever ( UL ) , the European consumer products conglomerate. \nNow there's Wall Street chatter that Kraft Heinz and Berkshire are shopping around for another deal . \nRelated: Warren Buffett on President-elect Trump: 'He deserves everybody's respect' \nBuffett also didn't take the time to mention Wells Fargo ( CBEAX ) . Berkshire owns 10% of the company, which came under fire last year for illegal sales practices. \nThe company has admitted that it created as many as 2 million fake accounts between 2011 and 2015. \nBuffett did offer ample praise for Berkshire insurance chief Ajit Jain. \nJain and Berkshire Hathaway Energy CEO Greg Abel are said to be the two leading candidates to replace Buffett when the octogenarian steps down. \n\"Ajit has created tens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders,\" Buffett wrote. \"If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap me for him, don't hesitate. Make the trade!\" \nBuffett supported Hillary Clinton during last year's election, and his letter on Saturday didn't mention President Trump. In November, he told CNN's Poppy Harlow that Trump \"deserves everybody's respect.\" \n\"That doesn't mean they can't criticize him or they can't disagree with what he's doing maybe,\" Buffett said. \"But we need a country unified.\" \nBuffett also announced Berkshire's annual meeting -- it'll take place in Omaha on May 6 -- and offered a few investing tidbits. \nThe take away: Invest in index funds that mirror the S&P-500, and keep fees to a minimum. \n\"When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients,\" he said. \"Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds.\" CNNMoney (New York)  58 AM ET", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T22:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T17:12:09.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
