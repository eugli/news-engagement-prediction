The next Star Wars Anthology spinoff will turn back the clock to when Han was a younger man, and so far the movie has rounded up a talented assortment of actors. Now there's word that Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge might be joining the cast, too, only in a very different capacity than her costars. \nAccording to Variety , Waller-Bridge is currently in talks to board the young Han Solo movie, and if a deal is reached, she will be delivering a \"CGI-driven performance,\" similar to what Alan Tudyk did for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story . Rest assured, though, her character will be an integral member of the ensemble. Assuming all goes according to plan, Waller-Bridge will join a cast that consists of Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo, Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian, Woody Harrelson as Han Solo's mentor and Emilia Clarke in an undisclosed role. Chewbacca is also expected to appear, though it hasn't been announced yet whether Peter Mayhew will be under the fur or someone else. \nPhoebe Waller-Bridge is arguably best known as the lead on the BBC Three/Amazon series Fleabag , which premiered its first season last summer and was nominated for two Critics' Choice Television Awards. Her other credits include Albert Nobbs , Broadchurch Season 2 and Man Up . Take a look at the Fleabag trailer below to get a sense of her acting talents. \nNo plot details have been revealed about the young Han Solo movie yet, aside from the obvious fact that it will follow what the protagonist was up to years before he met Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Leia Organa in A New Hope . It has been rumored that part of the story could show how Han won the Millennium Falcon from Lando, but that remains to be confirmed. So it's hard to speculate on who Phoebe Waller-Bridge might play, other than it won't be a normal human. Since the Empire is still going strong at this point in time, she could be another Imperial enforcer droid like K-2SO. On the other hand, the Star Wars universe is populated with all sorts of unusual aliens, so there's a good chance she might be a particularly unusual-looking creature. We here at CinemaBlend will be sure to let you know who this mysterious character is when an official announcement comes in. \nDirected by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the young Han Solo movie kicked off production last month, and it will be released in theaters on May 25, 2018.
