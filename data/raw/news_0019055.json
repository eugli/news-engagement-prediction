It cannot win the AIADMK at all,\" she said, accusing Pannerselvam of aiding the DMK's plot. She said the caretaker CM was a liar for alleging that that \"he was forced to resign\" to pave the way for her to become CM. \nShe also claimed the support of more than 120 MLAs at a legislature party meeting at the party headquarters and said no one would be able to split the party. \nInterestingly, both Sasikala and other AIADMK leaders like Lok Sabha deputy speaker M Thambidurai have exonerated the Centre from the charge of influencing OPS. They assert the plot was scripted by none other than Stalin and the DMK.
