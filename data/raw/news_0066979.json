Tannehill sprained both his ACL and MCL in his left knee, causing him to miss the final three games of the regular season and the team's wild-card game. Per Armando Salguero of the Miami Herald , Tannehill will play all next season with a knee brace after a recovery that included stem cell treatment. Before going down, the quarterback posted an 8-5 record as a starter with a 93.5 quarterback rating that was the best of his career. The 28-year-old has had an up-and-down career with the Dolphins since being taken in the first round of the 2012 draft. He started every game for five years until his knee injury but struggled with consistency as a starter. Still, he performed well enough to earn a contract extension through the 2020 season. With a full offseason to rehabilitate his knee, Tannehill should return to his starting role in 2017 with a talented team around him. The Dolphins will now try to reach the postseason in back-to-back years for the first time since 2001.
