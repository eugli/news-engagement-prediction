He tinkered with the system and managed to stash 16 iPhone 7 Plus units and mobile plans, registering them under the names of existing customers whose profiles were saved on the system. \nThe report said the Filipino sold the iPhone devices for 20 percent less than their original price. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe man was arrested after several customers reported that they received payment notices of phone plans they never purchased. \nThe OFW was arrested by authorities and admitted to the crimes.
