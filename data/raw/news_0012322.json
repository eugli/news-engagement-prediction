McInnes put his jab away and let the fly-half throw punches at will, and the height and reach advantage of Cooper was something he simply couldn’t overcome. McInnes ate punches from the outset. \nCooper’s barrage brought McInnes undone and the 28-year-old even attempted to catch the young Queenslander as he knocked him to the canvas to end the fight. \nNRL star Nathan Peats took aim at the match-up, calling it “s***” and “unfair” before applauding Cooper for looking after his opponent when the bout ended. McInnes copped some punishment. Source: News Corp Australia \nWhile McInnes was outclassed, he certainly wasn’t overawed. In fact, when he was told he was fighting Quade Cooper, the name didn’t set off any alarms. \n“Watching rugby union I knew who Quade was but when I got asked to fight Quade it never clicked with me who it was,” McInnes said on Triple M Brisbane’s Marto, Ed and Robin for Breakfast . \n“Honestly, I didn’t even know how to say his name. I texted my partner and I was like, ‘Who’s Quad Cooper?’” \nNo, that’s not a typo, McInnes actually thought his name was “Quad”. \nThe father of one started boxing to learn self defence because he was bullied at school, and got the call up to Adelaide Oval from Cooper’s trainers. \n“His trainers texted me because they couldn’t find anyone (for Cooper to fight) and I’ve fought on a few big shows in Brisbane and gave Quade’s trainers my number,” McInnes said. \n“It was an experience to go and do something like that against Quade. \n“As you can see I was being a bit of a smart arse and laughing at some of his punches.” \nGetting in the ring may not have even been the highlight of the night for the likeable Aussie. Reaching what could almost be described as cult hero status, the crowd roared for him and after the fight, when he was sinking beers and mingling with fans, he caught the attention of famous radio duo Hamish Blake and Andy Lee. \n“The best one was my partner seeing Hamish and Andy so we decided to walk over because my partner wanted to have a photo with them,” McInnes said. \n“Hamish looks up and goes, ‘Oh my God, Jack, Jack!’ then my partner got pushed out of the road and they all got selfies with me.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:39:21.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
