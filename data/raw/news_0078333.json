Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! \nOn Saturday Mr Trump announced he would not attend the annual White House Correspondents' dinner , a high-profile event that draws celebrities and politicians including previous US Presidents, who typically use the event to show a more light hearted side to the media. \n\"Please wish everyone well and have a great evening,\" he wrote on Twitter. \nOnly this morning White House press secretary Sean Spicer redoubled his attacks on the New York Times, repeating accusations that the paper had run a false story alleging contact between the Trump campaign team and Russian officials during last year's election. \n\"The New York Times published a story about what they called 'contacts' between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials,\" Mr Spicer said. \n\"The FBI deputy director was at a meeting here at the White House that morning. After the meeting concluded, he asked the chief of staff to stand back a second he wanted to tell him that the report in the New York Times was quote 'BS.' \n\"For viewers at home, I think we can pretty much figure out what that means.\" Russian link questions need to be answered: Bush \nThe FBI and separate Senate and House committees in Washington are already investigating the alleged links between Mr Trump's campaign team and Russia. \nMr Bush said the question needs to be answered, and did not rule out the merits of appointing a special prosecutor to investigate.

Whether or not the special prosecutor is the right way to go or not, you're talking to the wrong guy,\" he said. \n\"I have great faith in Richard Burr for example, he is the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee. \n\"If he were to recommend a special prosecutor then it would have a lot more credibility with me. \n\"I am sure though that that question needs to be answered.\" \nMr Bush said as US President he had tried to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin that Russia too needed an independent media. \n\"It's kind of hard to tell others to have independent free press when we're not free to have one ourselves,\" he said. \nMr Spicer knocked down the suggestion of a special prosecutor. \n\"A special prosecutor for what?\" he asked. \n\"You have had the intelligence community look at Russia's involvement in the election. You've had the House and the Senate both do the same. And so what I am trying to ascertain is that at what point how many people have to say there is nothing there before you realise there is nothing there? \n\"I continue to see reports coming from different media sources saying that when they checked in with law enforcement or intelligence community sources, there is nothing more then what has been previously reported over and over again.\" Give Trump time, Bush says \nMr Bush also spoke out about Mr Trump's travel ban on immigrants from seven Muslim majority nations. The US drafts new guidelines aimed at aggressively detaining and deporting immigrants living in the US illegally. \n\"I'm for an immigration policy that is welcoming and upholds the law,\" he said. \nIt is understood Mr Bush refused to vote for Mr Trump in the recent election, according to CNN. Nor did he vote for the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. \nBut in a small concession to Mr Trump, he acknowledged the difficulties he faces as President. \n\"The job is a tough job. Everyone looks at the presidency when they campaign one way, then they get in office and find out there is a reality to the job,\" he said. \nAsked to comment on Mr Trump's pledge to unify the country, Mr Bush said: \"There has only been one month in office, and he's got four years.\" \n\"Secondly, I think you have to take the man for his word that he wants to unify the country. And we'll see whether he's able to do so. It's hard to unify the country though with the news media so split up.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T13:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:40:20.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
