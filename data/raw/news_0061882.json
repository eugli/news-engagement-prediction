These former beauty queens have all made it big in Bollywood, which augurs well for Natasha. \nShe will soon make her debut in a Hindi film, and will be seen in a web series as well. Earlier, Natasha had worked in a regional film, King Liar, co-starring Malayalam star Dileep. \nTalking about cinema, Natasha reveals that it was her late mother, Radha Suri, who was the force behind her acting career. “I am a mama’s girl. Throughout my life, I’ve always listened to her. She wanted me to participate in beauty pageants, so I did that. And she was happy with whatever little I’ve achieved,” says Natasha. “She was also keen on me getting into acting, and pushed me really hard to give it a serious thought. And I could never say no to her. Though she isn’t there with me anymore, her blessings are always there, and I’m sure she’s happy with the way I am scripting my journey as an actor.” Read more Kangana Ranaut to Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar: Bollywood is wooing soldiers \nHowever, the path to a showbiz career wasn’t smooth.

So, when last year, I got the offers for both the web series and a Hindi film, I decided to take them up — the content was quite interesting. Around the same time, King Liar also happened, and by God’s grace, it did well down south,” she says. \nAs an actor, Natasha aspires to play a variety of roles. “For me, the character I’m playing is more important than the length of the role,” she says. “I want to do roles that would showcase my talent and also touch the audience. I want to explore different characters.” \nFollow @htshowbiz for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:21:11.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
