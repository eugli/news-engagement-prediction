These diverse corporations and non-profits – retailers, resorts, semiconductor manufacturers, hospitals, restaurant chains, power utilities and others – cumulatively account for nearly 520,000 jobs, or nearly one in four private-sector positions.\nBut as the nation and state move closer to full employment, more big enterprises are having trouble filling positions. Meanwhile, the recent push for minimum wages of $15 an hour could pressure the finances of these enterprises, and the demands of Millennials for flexibility and greater work/life balance portend fundamental changes in the employment environment.\nOur annual Republic 100 report on the state’s largest non-government employers assesses these and other trends, such as the emergence of casinos and the muscle exerted by nonprofits in health care, while highlighting the key entities on which so many Arizonans depend for a living.\nRepublic 100 \n\nSorry, but your browser does not support frames.
