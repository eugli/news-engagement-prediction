In a press release announcing the approval of the blood-thinner warfarin to control the animals, Miller said that \"the 'Hog Apocalypse' may finally be on the horizon.\" \nThat sentence is so Sid Miller: Just about everything the man says or tweets goes to 11. \nWe'll get into whether using warfarin is a good idea or a bad idea in a moment (spoiler alert: a little bit of both, probably). But, first, it's worth noting the timing of Miller's announcement. Because, quelle coïncidence , about 24 hours after his office amended the Texas Administrative Code and gave the high sign to kaput filthy swine with Kaput Feral Hog Lure , the Dallas City Council went in the exact opposite direction. Dallas to take yet another shot at eradicating feral hogs, 'a menace to our city' \nBy a vote of 14-1, the council agreed to pay an Aledo-based company called Striker Outfitters a total of $347,100 over the next three years to \"humanely trap and remove\" hogs across the city. Striker Outfitters will be tasked with rounding up the wild beasts causing millions of dollars of damage to municipal golf courses, lake shores, riverbeds, fields and giant swaths of the Great Trinity Forest. \nWednesday's vote came after a 10-month pilot program with Striker Outfitters that the city's urban biologist, Brett Johnson, said Wednesday has resulted in the capture of 96 hogs on just a handful of southern Dallas parcels, among them the Joppa Preserve, the Great Trinity Forest Trail and Keeton Golf Course off North Jim Miller and Bruton roads. \n\"What we have seen is in those areas, where we've been actively trapping, is a significant reduction,\" Johnson said. \"We do know adjacent properties still have feral hogs on there, which is why it's important to make this a citywide effort.\" \nAnd he does mean citywide: Most folks think feral hogs are running amok in southern Dallas, near the Audubon Center or in the forest, or, maybe, near White Rock Creek. But in the last couple of weeks, Johnson said, he's seen evidence of rooting within 10 feet of Interstate 35E near Northwest Highway and Harry Hines Boulevard, and he's terrified that they might wind up wandering along Stemmons Freeway one day or, worse, one night. \nAccording to the city's deal with Striker Outfitters, after the hogs are penned and collected they're driven to Frontier Meats in Fort Worth, where they're slaughtered and sliced into bacon — lean cuisine for the Paleo set . The trappers get to keep every cent of the sales, an incentive to trap as many pigs as possible. Most of the meat winds up in Europe and Asia. But if you're at all interested, I have found what appears to be an excellent recipe for Tagliatelle with Wild Boar Ragout and Pecorino di Pienza , bon appétit ! The city's new trapping program includes cameras that record the moment feral hogs are trapped. (FCourtesy City of Dallas) More feral hogs recently trapped as part of the city's pilot program \nNow, sure. The outcome's the same, whether you trap or poison the hogs. Fill 'em full of warfarin or truck 'em to Frontier — dead's dead, and that's that. Whatever it takes to adios the \"menace to our city,\" the appellation given the wild hogs by City Hall in a briefing last year. \nExcept, there's the obvious problem that poisoning a feral hog risks poisoning everything else in the food chain. Which is why hunters and conservationists and urban biologists are largely in agreement that declaring warfarin on feral hogs is a pretty bad idea. In fact, the Texas Hog Hunters Association is begging Miller's office to pocket its poison, and its explanation is pretty simple to digest: \n\"For Texas to introduce a poison into the equation is a bad decision in our opinion and could likely contaminate humans who unknowingly process and eat feral hogs,\" says the just-launched online petition , which already has more than 4,200 virtual signatures. \"We certainly don't want to be out hunting hogs and kill and consume a poisoned animal.\" Feral hogs are in Dallas City Council's crosshairs \nI figured maybe the state intends to use the poison in rural areas, where ranchers with big spreads don't have the resources or inclination to ensnare feral hogs in traps with thermometers and video cameras. But the Department of Agriculture's Perry Cervantes said no, not necessarily. \nHe told me Wednesday that cities might want to wind up swallowing the poison pill because \"the trapping only works to an extent, and we're not trapping enough of them.\" \nI called the ag department initially to ask about the hunters' concerns. Because I think we've learned at this point that if there's one group of folks in this state Sid Miller's going to take seriously, it's hunters . Alas, in this case, not so much. Encounter with feral hogs in Dallas Great Trinity Forest 8/8/15 during water testing hike at Big Spring pic.twitter.com/GZQW3rpl82 — Ben Sandifer (@Ben_Sandifer) August 8, 2015 \nCervantes said that, well, the new rule limits the sale of the Kaput Feral Hog Lure to state-approved pesticide applicators, which is to say people who've taken the exam and procured a license. But that does nothing to diminish the chance of things that could go wrong — like, say, a tumped-over feeder or bait pen that allows other animals to dine on the poison. More likely, we're looking at rotting carcasses being snacked on by otherwise innocent carnivores. \n\"Any kind of animal — vultures, coyotes, birds that eat stomach contents, entrails, intestines — could be poisoned,\" said Ben Sandifer, the Dallas accountant and Trinity River guardian who at this point probably spends more time with feral hogs than people. He even talks about feral hogs as though they're human, referring to one big fella at Big Spring as \"weary, ornery.\" \nSandifer has spent years documenting the damage wrought by feral hogs across the southern part of the city, among them Big Spring, deemed historic enough by City Hall to merit landmark protections. His photos of the hogs and the damage done have adorned city briefings on the subject . And just last December he tweeted that the city had closed off Big Spring as it \"wrestles [with an] out of control hog population.\" \nBut he concurs with Johnson: Where the trapping program's been piloted in recent months, the population's taken a big dip — and he has the science to back it up. \n\"'I do water testing at Big Spring for E. coli — animal feces — and since the trapping began, the amount of E. coli has dropped off,\" he told me Wednesday. \nBefore then, Sandifer said, levels had been \"real high.\" Now, he said, \"it's almost nothing.\" \nWhich is no small something, considering the incalculable damage done in recent decades, and the fear that the hogs' march would prove unstoppable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:17:12.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
