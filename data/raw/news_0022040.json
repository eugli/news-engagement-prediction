Source: 1 News 'Suffered tremendous hurt and stigma': Goverment to wipe historic homosexual convictions \nJustice Minister Amy Adams made the announcement on Thursday afternoon, with the move allowing people convicted before the homosexual law reform in 1986 to have their convictions removed. \nPeople with convictions for specific offences relating to consensual sexual activity between men 16 years and over will be eligible to apply to the Secretary of Justice to have the conviction wiped. \nHowever, Adams said those who committed acts which are still illegal today are not included. \n\"The acts were illegal at the time - obviously that is not the view of society now, and I would agree with that, but at the time they were criminal offending and we judge criminality by the law at the time,\" she said. Adams said a blanket rule would not work, instead a case-by-case process is best.

Photo: Getty \nThe policy change in New Zealand comes after Britain agreed in October to pardon thousands of gay and bisexual men convicted under obsolete legislation. \nThe scheme is set to begin in 2018 - as soon as the necessary law changes are in place. \nIf a person's application is approved, government records will be amended so the conviction does not appear in criminal history checks and they will be entitled to declare they have no such conviction. \nDecisions will be made by the secretary of justice, without the need for formal court hearings or for applicants to appear in person. \nACT leader David Seymour has praised the Government's move, saying it's \"absolutely the right thing to do\".
