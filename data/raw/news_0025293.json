Facebook By Diana Bruk Feb 13, 2017 New Yorkers Amy Bzura, 27, and Bradley Moss, 32, had planned a a $325,000 wedding at the swanky Pierre Hotel last October — right around Halloween. But in a ~horror story~ of epic proportions, all of that fell apart during their rehearsal dinner the night before when a fight erupted between their in-laws, according to a lawsuit obtained by The New York Post . Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The suit, which was filed by the father of the bride, Bruce Bzura, claims that just as Amy's brother, Adam, was about to make a heartfelt speech for the couple, the groom's father, Robert Moss, “inexplicably and angrily declared that Adam was not allowed to speak,” before growling, \"Do you know what I can do to you?\" The suit does not elaborate on what provoked Moss, but the whole situation escalated quickly: the groom's brother punched the Adam in the face, and the groom's father tried to charge him, while the bride's father held him back. Would-be bride Amy then allegedly told her fiance he had to choose her or his mother, and he picked his family — the evening ended with his mom Wendy tearfully telling guests that the wedding was off. All of which leads us to wonder: what the hell was Adam going to say?!

The Mosses also changed the locks on the couple's apartment the two of them shared so that Amy could not even enter to claim her belongings, and let her back in to retrieve her possessions only when accompanied by a police officer, the suit claims. Bradley has since sued Amy for the $125,000 engagement ring he gave her, as she has not yet returned the rock. The Bzuras are seeking payment for the wedding, claiming the Mosses had previously promised to pay just shy of $90,000 to cover their side of the wedding party. Michael Antongiovanni, a lawyer for the Mosses, refuted the claims of the lawsuit, saying, “We look forward to answering these baseless allegations.” And hey, just looking on the bright side, there's at least a chance for one of these former lovebirds to use their story as a casting hook for a future season of The Bachelor / Bachelorette ?
