Police went house-to-house ringing bells and knocking on doors to remind people living within a 1.9-kilometer (1.18-mile) radius, mostly in the western suburb of Kordelio, to leave their homes. \nMany people left in their cars, but some were being bused to schools and sports halls elsewhere in the city, where they can find food and shelter. ADVERTISEMENT \nOthers, like 26-year-old Alexander Bogdani and his wife, Anna Bokonozi, left on foot. The couple, pushing a stroller with their toddler daughter, were going to a place about 1 kilometer (over 1/2 mile) from their home. \n“They have warned us … we are afraid for the child,” Bogdani said. \nThe city’s main bus station was shut down, trains in the area were halted and churches canceled their Sunday services. The city also booked a 175-room hotel where people with limited mobility and their escorts were taken on Saturday. \n“This is the largest population move in peacetime. People must be calm and not panic,” Central Macedonia governor Apostolos Tzitzikostas said. \nThe operation to defuse the bomb, found under a gas station, is expected to last about six hours, authorities say. \nArmy bomb disposal experts will initially attempt to defuse the bomb’s detonator, and then transport it to an army firing range, where they will figure out what further steps to take, said army spokesman Col. Nikos Fanios. \nFanios said the device’s exterior was too degraded to be able to determine whether it was a German or an Allied bomb. But one resident says he recalls the day it fell. \n“The bombing was done by English and American planes on Sept. 17, 1944. It was Sunday lunchtime,” said Giorgos Gerasimou, 86, whose home is half a mile away. \nThe Allies were targeting local German rail facilities, he said. \nNazi Germany occupied Greece from 1941 until October 1944. –Costas Kantouris/RGA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T13:29:55.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
