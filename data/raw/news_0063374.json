Tucker from Suns in deadline deal The Raptors will give up two second-round picks and Jared Sullinger. P.J. Tucker is coming back to the Toronto Raptors. ( Matt York / The Associated Press ) By Doug Smith Sports Reporter Thu., Feb. 23, 2017 It’s hard to imagine Masai Ujiri having a much better week in his professional life than the one he just had. The Toronto Raptors president capped a significant seven days by addressing another need on his roster, obtaining gritty forward PJ Tucker from the Phoenix Suns for a bargain basement price minutes before Thursday’s NBA trade deadline. The deal to repatriate Tucker — who the Raptors originally selected in the second round of the 2006 draft — was the expiring contract of seldom used forward Jared Sullinger and second round picks in 2016 and 2017. The Raptors, facing a summer when they will have to spend significant sums to keep the core of the team intact, also get the so-called Bird Rights to Tucker, meaning they can re-sign him without regard to the NBA salary cap. On the court, the 6-foot-6 Tucker is a logical fit as a tough, defensive-minded veteran who can guard both forward positions and someone who has grown into an acceptable three-point shooter. Article Continued Below Along with the acquisition last week of starting power forward Serge Ibaka, Ujiri filled the only two holes on a roster that could now present a legitimate challenge in the Eastern Conference. The Raptors also got Bird Rights to Ibaka, who is expected to sign a long-term deal in Toronto when he’s a free agent in July. Ujiri also managed to hang on to a first-round pick in what’s seen as a deep 2017 draft. The price in the Ibaka transaction was Terrence Ross and the worst of the team’s two first-round picks (their own and one owned by the Los Angeles Clippers) in this year’s draft.
