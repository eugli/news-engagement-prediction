(FOX News) \n“Business journalism is never going to be the same. I just don’t know, now that she’s gone, whether we’ll ever be.” \nFormer Fox News commentator Tobin Smith remembered Buttner in a touching Facebook post. \n“She loved rainy days, cloudy places, motorcycles and her children most of all. I told her that I would spread a few of her ashes in her beloved Edinborough outside her favorite pub...she loved that idea. She called me her ‘office husband’ and I told her that ‘all I got was c--p from her and none the benefits’ and she would laugh a hearty obscenity in response,” he wrote. \n“My role in her life the last few years was to make her laugh...and I accomplished that goal on many phone calls. She was the type of friend you could not speak with with for months and then talk like we had just left off from yesterday. \n“My dear Brenda Buttner..she was the little sister I never had. I miss her terribly and yet she is in my heart forever and an inspiration to all that knew her and her battle.” Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:18:08.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
