The video begins after they've both been strapped into their harnesses and the cables are pulling them skywards. Both visibly nervous, the unnamed girl relishes the anticipation of the ride while the boyfriend remains quieter, struggling to put on a brave face. Hilarious footage shows the moment a couple dared to try out the 200-ft Sky Swing only for the boyfriend to pass out - twice As they're both lifted the girl is clearly enjoying the experience far more than her panicked boyfriend who swears 13 times in a row As they're both being lifted in the Sky Swing the man shakes his head in fear while his girlfriend says repeatedly 'oh my goodness' while laughing nervously. The man begins panicking and swears 13 times in a row, genuinely afraid of the coming fall. In a cruel twist it's the passengers of the ride who actually have to pull a cord to release themselves, some 60 metres in the air. Moments before the girl pulls the cord they tell each other they love one and other before rapidly descending to the ground below.
