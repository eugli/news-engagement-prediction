Brown/Getty Images John Legend The singer's twitter account began posting bizarre, and explicit, anti-Trump comments on Friday night, as well as references to party drugs and performing sexual acts wth Hillary Clinton. \nJohn Legend, who has been vocal in his disapproval of president Donald Trump in the past, had his Twitter account apparently hacked on Friday night. \nAfter tweets on the singer's account called Trump \"Liar-in-Chief\" and referenced \"crises in Bowling Green and Sweden\", a knock on Trump's recent comments about a terror attack that never occurred by Trump cabinet member Kellyanne Conway and a gaffah made by Trump himself, Legend posted \"Someone just hacked my account.\" Our president is too preoccupied with the crises in Bowling Green and Sweden. He can't speak out against hate crimes by white supremacists. https://t.co/QUC7MJ4QUN — John Legend (@johnlegend) February 25, 2017 Quick fact check on the Liar-In-Chief: These particular news outlets are doing extremely well right now. https://t.co/uZW2TFyCw5 — John Legend (@johnlegend) February 25, 2017 Someone just hacked my account. — John Legend (@johnlegend) February 25, 2017 \nHowever, minutes later a series of bizarre, and explicit tweets came pouring in. \"I can not stand by and be silent. @realDonaldTrump , you're a bitch ass n— and if I see you, I'm stomping your shit you f—ing cheetoh,\" one tweet read, while others referenced Hillary Clinton and a desire to perform lewd actions with the former presidential candidate as well as references to drugs and strip clubs. \nAnother tweet read: \"i will follow 5 who follow @Owen755.\" The linked account was an unverified user, who soonafter claimed responsibility for the hack with a tweet of his own: \"That was fun.\" That was fun.
