But how many remember the following act in Sutton’s FA Cup story that year, the difficult second album, if you like? If beating Coventry had been Sutton’s successful debut, then their visit Norwich City away was their Neither Fish Nor Flesh moment.\nIn fairness, Sutton were more than one-hit wonders. Even before their exploits against Coventry, Barrie Williams’ team had made some ripples in the FA Cup in 1988, knocking out league opposition in Aldershot and Peterborough, before taking Second Division Middlesbrough to a replay at Ayresome Park. The 1-0 defeat against a Boro side that would gain promotion to the top flight highlighted Sutton’s capabilities, but the Coventry match put the club firmly on the map.\nSutton’s Craig Eastmond: ‘Arsenal will realise non-league is the real world’ Read more \nDefeating a team that was sitting fifth in the First Division was always going to grab headlines but there were other ingredients in place that added spice to the occasion. Nine of the Coventry team who lost to Sutton had featured at Wembley in their glorious FA Cup final win over Tottenham and, in anticipation of a possible upset, John Motson had been dispatched to Gander Green Lane, with the tie the main feature on Match of the Day.\nAll of these factors – the shock, the opponents, the BBC coverage – brought the club a lot of media exposure, with Williams attracting a great deal of attention. We were informed ad nauseam that the former teacher liked to quote Shakespeare, Kipling, and Hardy, but we also discovered that he had done a sterling job at Sutton during his decade in charge.\n“I am delighted that we won by playing good football,” Williams said after the Coventry match, before revealing that he had done his homework before the tie. Spotting a possible opportunity at set pieces, Williams had taken his players to a park near Sutton’s stadium to practise a few routines on the morning of the match. As Williams may have quoted himself, action is eloquence .\nTaking on Norwich at Carrow Road would be a step up for his team. Williams’ part-time players – including bricklayers, assistant bank managers, insurance executives, a commodity broker and a sheet metal worker – were now facing a team that had topped Division One for a large part of the season.\nA recent win at Anfield demonstrated Norwich’s confidence , and even though they had recently lost to the Coventry side Sutton had embarrassed, there was no debating that Sutton’s 12/1 odds for the tie were fully justified. However, Norwich manager Dave Stringer warned against complacency and pointed out that their displays against Middlesbrough were proof that they should not be underestimated.\nViews from the Sutton camp varied. Williams was refreshingly honest. “I wouldn’t say that Norwich will give us a good hiding, but I would have to accept that Norwich will beat us easily. Some people are giving us an even chance but that’s plain daft. We know we have no right to be on the same pitch as them.” Captain Tony Rains, who scored the opener against Coventry, thought Norwich might become nervous if Sutton could hold out for the first 20 minutes. And Lennie Dennis, the Sutton forward who had made his one and only appearance for Jamaica the year before, was more bullish, saying: “We are in with a realistic chance.”\nIn the week leading up to the fourth round, the Sutton players were in demand, as their feelgood story grabbed the nation’s attention. The team even had to turn down the offer of agent representation from Eric Hall. “The players unanimously agreed they did not want anything to do with an agent,” said Williams. Sutton enjoyed a great deal of support on the day, with 17 coaches making the journey to Norfolk, as 6,000 Sutton fans piled into Carrow Road creating the biggest crowd of Norwich’s season. It soon became apparent, though, that they were not going to witness a famous upset.\nSutton goalkeeper Trevor Roffey had already saved well from Mark Bowen and Malcolm Allen before he was beaten for the first time after 14 minutes. Trevor Putney opened the scoring with a deflected drive and, when Allen doubled the lead just two minutes later , John Motson stuck his neck on the block, saying: “It looks as though the Sutton Cup dream may be over as early as the 16th minute.”\nA fantastic finish from Robert Fleck gave Norwich a 3-0 lead at half-time and the gap between the First Division and the Conference was clearly demonstrated in Norwich’s fourth goal . A slick and fast passing move involving Bowen, Fleck, Mike Phelan, Andy Townsend and Putney, led to Allen’s second of the match, as Sutton’s weary players began to chase shadows. \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Norwich City peppered the Sutton United goalkeeper with shots. Photograph: Phil O'Brien/PA \nRoffey performed admirably but, after a defensive error involving Robyn Jones and Nigel Golley, the keeper let a weak Fleck shot squeeze past him . Roffey’s father Dave had played in Sutton’s last fourth-round match – a 6-0 defeat to Don Revie’s Leeds in 1970 – and, with Norwich continuing to pile on the pressure, Roffey was fearing the worst. “I didn’t want to let in 10,” he admitted later. \nFleck completed his hat-trick five minutes later . Sportingly Roffey shook the hand of Fleck, an image that featured in the papers over the next few days, and even after sacrificing £60 in wages travelling up on the Friday, and being in the firing line all afternoon, Roffey “enjoyed every moment and wouldn’t have missed it for anything.” The keeper was at fault when Allen completed his hat-trick after 73 minutes but there was nothing the keeper could do about Allen’s sublime lob for Norwich’s eighth and final goal .\nFA Cup third round: AFC Wimbledon's return to Sutton United – in pictures Read more \nAs the final whistle sounded, Sutton were applauded generously by the Norwich fans on a lap of honour. “Their supporters accorded the non-league side a genuine welcome and a hero’s farewell,” wrote Ian Stewart in the Times, with Norwich keeper Bryan Gunn later presenting his kit and gloves to Roffey. Williams was spot-on when he said that his team “gained fame in victory, so we lost nothing in defeat”.\n“I told them at the end there was no disgrace,” said Williams. “Norwich gave us a lesson and were a credit to the professional game. I hope we were a credit to the non-league game.” Throughout the whole experience, Williams and his team had gained huge popularity, but the Sutton boss knew the reality of the situation. “We’ll be yesterday’s heroes soon enough.”\n“I’m sorry we didn’t do better for the fans, but football can be a harsh mistress,” Williams concluded. He had no need to apologise, though. Williams and his men had given their supporters a day out at a First Division stadium and had added another entry in the list of FA Cup shocks by defeating Coventry. It would take 24 years for a Conference team to repeat Sutton’s feat of beating a top-flight club. Norwich fans probably don’t want reminding of that, though .\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \n• This article appeared first on That 1980s Sports Blog \n• Follow Steven Pye on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T13:37:25.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
