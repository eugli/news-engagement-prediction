As one might expect, given its obsession with pansexual interspecies romance, the 14 cards included in this limited edition set seem mostly to be jokes about space racism and boning down with aliens. Talking to Polygon , Cards Against Humanity’s Trin Garritano said, in a shocking turn, it was BioWare that lobbied for more sex talk. “Whenever we’d look at the list of cards their team preferred, it was only cards about fucking,” Garritano told Polygon . “We had to push through a few non-sex cards just to widen the appeal of the deck. It was an incredible problem to have and I am still absolutely tickled by this.” \nThe expansion pack even comes in a sleeve with drawings of Commander Shepard (the male version) and Kaidan Alenko that “smooch when you close the booklet,” Garritano mentioned. You can nab a pack while they last at—where else?— totallyfuckablealiens.com for $1, and that includes shipping for buyers in the U.S. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:15:08.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
