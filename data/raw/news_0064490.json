REUTERS/Ezra Acayan 4/4 \nMANILA A Philippines Senator and staunch critic of President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs was arrested on Friday by law enforcement agents after charges were filed in court alleging she received money from drug dealers inside the country's prisons. \nSenator Leila de Lima, her former driver and bodyguard and a former national prison official were ordered to be arrested by a local court after a judge found merit in criminal charges filed by the Department of Justice last week. \n\"The truth will come out and I will achieve justice. I am innocent,\" she told reporters shortly before law enforcers escorted her away from her office. \nShe is facing two more drug-related charges in the same court. \n(Reporting by Karen Lema; Editing by Richard Pullin) Next In World News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:10:00.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
