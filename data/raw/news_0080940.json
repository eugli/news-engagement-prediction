Leicester were sublime as they cruised to a 3-1 defeat against Liverpool. Article continues below \nJamie Vardy has been a shadow of the player he was last season - his goal against Sevilla last week was his first since December - but playing against Liverpool seems to bring the best out of the 30-year-old. \nForget not scoring a league goal in 2017, Vardy had failed to record a single shot on target in the calendar year before tonight. Article continues below Gary Lineker posts brilliant tweet after Jamie Vardy scores vs Liverpool \nHe managed three this evening - in the first half. \nThe England international’s brace means he has now scored five league goals against Liverpool in three appearances. Danny Drinkwater also got on the scoresheet with a thunderous volley as the Foxes climbed to 15th in the table. Video: Drinkwater's screamer \nPhilippe Coutinho’s goal had Liverpool supporters dreaming of a potential Leicstanbul, but Jurgen Klopp’s side were unable to do what they did against AC Milan 12 years ago. What's Ranieri thinking? \nA penny for Ranieri’s thoughts after this one. His former players have been heavily criticised for their apparent involved in his sacking - according to The Times , Kasper Schmeichel, Jamie Vardy, Marc Albrighton and Wes Morgan played a part in owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha’s decision to relieve the 65-year-old of his duties, which is shameful considering Ranieri helped elevate their careers last season. \nIt took a change of manager for Leicester’s players to fight. Why didn’t they fight for the man who led them to a Premier League title? \nThat’s a question only Vardy and co. will know the answer to. Meanwhile, Klopp has his own questions to answer. Liverpool's struggles \nLiverpool have now won just once in the league in 2017. Their hopes of finishing in the top four suffered a serious setback as they opened the door for Manchester United. \nThe Red Devils, sixth in the table and a point behind Liverpool, have a game in hand in which they can leapfrog their rivals. \nThe highlight for Liverpool came from Nathaniel Clyne in the 87th minute. Clyne pulled out the tricks at 3-1 down \nThe Reds were trailing 3-1 when the full-back successfully pulled off a rabona cross which found Coutinho. \nAbout to lose to a relegation-threatened team and Clyne is showing off his tricks. You’ve got to admire his audacity. Video: Clyne's rabona cross \nLiverpool’s supporters certainly did. Check out the reaction below. \nIf you’re going to lose, you might as well lose in style. Will Leicester stay up? Let us know in the comments section below! \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
