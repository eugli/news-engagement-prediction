In researching my new novel The Wedding Girls, I stumbled on a lost world of innocence and hope — a time when divorce was never seriously considered an option and girls married for life. For couples like Lilly Spatz and Michael Harris, and Joy Linton and Gerry Collins, a wedding was an occasion all about love, family and community. Glamorous weddings were a backlash against long years of economic hardship. Pictured here newlyweds Joy Linton and Gerry Collins in 1954 A Jewish wedding photograph of Mr and Mrs Summers, taken by Boris Bennett in 1935 Glamorous weddings were a backlash against long years of economic hardship which, combined with the emergence of Hollywood, meant young brides were determined to sprinkle a dusting of elegance over their big day. With many young women working in the rag trade in the East End, it was a badge of honour to look as stylish as possible for your wedding. Pat Spicer employed the services of Jewish photographer Boris Bennett, whose studio was the place to go for stylish wedding shoots. Using exquisitely painted backdrops and subtle lighting, Boris could transform any bride into a sophisticated showstopper. He even had a uniformed commissionaire to meet and greet newlyweds on arrival. Onlookers would gather outside his studio on the Whitechapel Road to catch a glimpse of the bride — including dressmakers, sketchbooks in hand, seeking inspiration. Pat says: ‘We went for the complete set, nine framed photos and a book at 16 guineas [nearly £17, when the average weekly salary was £7]. It was expensive but I had to have it. For inspiration, brides looked to the celebrities of their day, society girls such as Nancy Beaton A new book has bought together stunning pictures of glamorous Jewish newlyweds as they embarked on their lives together ‘My family had saved for my wedding for years. ‘We posed against a beautiful cream archway with dreamy lighting. Boris arranged extra tulle around the bottom of my dress and taught us how to pose. ‘I wore a white satin gown and a sweetheart neckline with an inlet of lace, cathedral sleeves, 22 satin buttons on the back, a fluted train and a lovers’ knot embroidered in the veil. A local dressmaker made it and we had four fittings in her front parlour. ‘After the photographs it was back down to earth with a bump. But thanks to the experience of posing for my wedding portrait, which I still treasure, I felt so special. Bill called me his pocket Venus.’ Back then, studio portraiture was de rigueur across all classes. To own a beautiful wedding portrait, in the days when few owned a camera, was a badge of honour. And in the gloom and deprivation of post-war Britain, it was a symbol of hope. Pat Spicer employed the services of Jewish photographer Boris Bennett, whose studio was the place to go for stylish wedding shoots For many East End women now in their 90s, it is still their most treasured belonging. ‘My future husband Brian was just back from serving with the 7th Armoured Division, one of Montgomery’s brave “Desert Rats”, when I met him at a dance,’ recalls 90-year-old Renee Stack, who was then a 17-year-old shop girl. ‘He walked over and said: “I’m going to marry you.” ’ Renee’s strict Jewish mother was less impressed. ‘Wait and see what he makes of himself first,’ was her advice. Brian knuckled down to civilian life and spent three years learning Hebrew so he could convert to Judaism in order to marry Renee. At their wedding in 1948, Renee looked so serenely beautiful she could have passed for Rita Hayworth. ‘We had no money so Brian borrowed a suit and my friend Edie made my beautiful pale blue silk, crepe wedding dress. I said to her, “But I’ve no money to pay you!” “It’s a wedding gift,” she insisted. A happy union: Lilly Spatz and Michael Harris in 1938 taken by photographer Boris Bennett ‘I did my own hair and make-up and the whole family chipped in to pay for the wedding portrait. ‘We married on a shoestring but I was the happiest girl alive, just 21 and with so much hope for the future.’ Indeed, the wedding announcements in the East London Advertiser from 1936 provide a joyous contrast with the bleak news of the day. Buried among articles on outbreaks of tuberculosis and fascist demonstrations, the young brides beam out from page after page. I was deeply touched by the care each couple took to look their absolute best — and by the hope, resilience and pride shining from their faces. In 1936, the prospect of war loomed darkly. How many of these dashing bridegrooms went to fight in that war? Mercifully, these thoughts could not have been further from their minds on the most momentous day of their lives. The photographs featured in Vintage Glamour In London's East End were taken between 1927 and the mid 1950s by sought-after studio snapper Boris Bennett Using exquisitely painted backdrops and subtle lighting, Boris could transform any bride into a sophisticated showstopper For inspiration, brides looked to the celebrities of their day, society girls such as Nancy Beaton, whose wedding in January 1933 at St Margaret’s Church, Westminster, to Sir Hugh Smiley, a Guards officer and baronet, was attended by the cream of London society. Her brother, the famous photographer Cecil Beaton, stage-managed the wedding so his younger sister would appear dream-like from the snow, a tiny, ethereal vision in a long sweep of buttery silk. Nancy was attended by eight bridesmaids linked by a single garland designed by up-and-coming florist Constance Spry. The page boys looked as if they had stepped from the pages of a fairy tale in their white satin breeches. It was pure theatre. Nancy’s wedding photo appeared in all the newspapers and was devoured by brides-to-be eager to capture something of her glamour. Look closely at it and in the background you can see dozens of strangers in the chilly churchyard, clamouring for a glimpse of the so-called ‘Snow Queen’. Could a footballer or reality TV star’s wedding today, auctioned to the highest-bidding magazine, ever hope to match such refined glamour? In researching my new novel The Wedding Girls, I stumbled on a lost world of innocence and hope — a time when divorce was never seriously considered an option and girls married for life Back then, people didn’t give two hoots for the trappings over which some modern brides obsess. Favours, canapes, hen-dos and honeymoon safaris were unheard of. The most young newlyweds could hope for was a few days in a seaside boarding house. Importantly, a wedding was a community event to share. Former machinist Edith Myers, 88, from Stepney, agrees. ‘In my day, weddings used to go on for weeks — or until the beer ran out. ‘Sometimes they would take the window frame out to get the piano out onto the street. Everyone in the neighbourhood brought something along to the party.’ Aged 90 and still singing in her local cafe in Bethnal Green, Henrietta Keeper cut a dazzling figure on her wedding day in 1947. During the Blitz, the blonde songbird and her sisters would entertain those sheltering in the Underground by singing to drown out the bombs. Back then, people didn’t give two hoots for the trappings over which some modern brides obsess Favours, canapes, hen-dos and honeymoon safaris were unheard of. The most young newlyweds could hope for was a few days in a seaside boarding house Importantly, a wedding was a community event to share After the war, she caught the eye of handsome coalman Joe Keeper. ‘ “Hello Curly,” he’d shout down from his horse-drawn cart,’ says Henrietta. ‘Every day he’d throw down an orange for me and some free coal for my mum to keep her sweet. He was so strong he could carry a two hundredweight (16st) sack of coal on his back up the stairs of the buildings with ease. ‘I married at St Andrew’s Church, Bethnal Green, in a dress my friend made. The reception was a few sausage rolls in a chilly church hall and there was no honeymoon. I was back to work two days later as a seamstress, but I didn’t care. I was the happiest girl alive.’ Joe was a ‘good provider’ and they had 50 happy years of marriage and three beautiful daughters before he passed away. Renee Stack with her 1948 wedding portrait Henrietta wouldn’t have looked out of place on the silver screen — which was naturally where she looked for inspiration. Between the wars, Hollywood was at the heart of popular culture for working people — and in the 1930s, 65 per cent of the public saw at least one film a week. Nearly every film contained a kiss at the altar. But if notions of romance and glamour were what carried these brides up the aisle, it was commitment and sacrifice that made their marriages last the distance. ‘The wedding day itself wasn’t so important. It was the rest of our married lives which meant something,’ Pat concludes, echoing a sentiment I heard again and again. ‘We never gave up on a marriage.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:44:40.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
