Through attorneys Paul Bardacke and Breanna Hougton, Holm has filed a complaint against referee Todd Anderson and is asking that the NYSAC “review Referee Anderson’s failure to assess a foul and render a decision regarding a point deduction following round 2, and failure to assess a foul and a point deduction following round 3, and determine an appropriate result.” An NYSAC official informed Sherdog.com that the commission has not yet received Holm's appeal as of this writing. De Randamie claimed the inaugural women’s featherweight title with a five-round decision over Holm in the UFC 208 headliner this past Saturday. All three cageside judges -- Sal D’Amato, Chris Lee and Jeff Mullen -- scored the contest 48-47 in favor of de Randamie. However, the Dutch striker landed blows after the bell in both the second and third round but was only given a warning from Anderson following the second instance. The punch that landed following round two was particularly damaging, as it appeared to wobble Holm before she returned to her corner. “Had referee Anderson complied with NYSAC regulations and deducted points from de Randamie in accordance with Section 212.10 through 212.11,” the complaint states, “the UFC 208 featherweight title fight would have resulted in a draw, if not a win, for Ms. Holm.” De Randamie has since denied criticisms that she is a dirty fighter and has offered to give Holm a rematch “to make sure that the winner of this historic belt is crystal clear.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:28:18.796+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
