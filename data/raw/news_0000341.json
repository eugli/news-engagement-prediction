The name of the whiskey is a reference to the town's water tower that burned down in the early 1900s. (Kristan Lieb / Chicago Tribune) Anthony Settipani Chicago Tribune \nFor most people, cinnamon-flavored whiskeys evoke flashbacks to barely remembered nights sweated away in downtown nightclubs and pulsing fraternity basements. Following the commercial success of Fireball cinnamon-flavored liqueur, even big whiskey-makers like Jack Daniel's and Jim Beam jumped aboard the cinnamon train. \nHeavily sweetened and marketed toward the heartiest of partyers, most of these products don't appeal to those who actually enjoy both whiskey and cinnamon. Derrick Mancini, owner and founder of Quincy Street Distillery in Riverside wanted to make something to fill this gap. \nMancini prides himself on creating spirits using traditional, handcrafted methods, and he applies this craft sensibility to a cinnamon-flavored whiskey that's as good sipped as it is in a shot. His version, which he's calling Water Tower on Fire, is a cinnamon spinoff of his Water Tower White Lightning, an unaged white corn whiskey. \n\"The conventional way that people will do cinnamon flavoring is to buy an extract,\" Mancini says. \"We want to do it in a more traditional way, just like you would do at home.\" Artisan distiller Kristan Lieb / Chicago Tribune Quincy Street Distillery owner Derrick Mancini uses four types of cinnamon in his flavored whiskey.

(Kristan Lieb / Chicago Tribune) \nUsing the white whiskey as a base, Mancini extracts the cinnamon flavor by letting it soak for several days with whole sticks of various types of cinnamon. The result is a powerfully aromatic, amber-colored spirit with a healthy burn from whiskey and cinnamon alike. \n\"Many of the 'cinnamon whiskeys' out there are actually liqueurs,\" Mancini says, referring to the common industry practice of adding sugar and other sweeteners to their spirits. \"This is not a liqueur. This is whiskey, at whiskey strength, that's been flavored by pure cinnamon with no additives. And we've chosen different kinds of cinnamons to get a more interesting blend of flavors.\" \nThere are four major types of cinnamon, Mancini explains, each originating from a different geographical region. Cassia, or Chinese cinnamon, is the cheapest variety and has become increasingly prominent for commercial purposes. Ceylon cinnamon, also called verum or true cinnamon, is the flavor most people will readily recognize as cinnamon. Indonesian and Vietnamese cinnamon are two other varieties commonly used in commercial applications. Mancini uses all four to flavor his whiskey. \n\"The verum is the core,\" he says, with smaller amounts of the other three. \nThe four cinnamons combine for a complex full-mouth sensation, complete with a satisfying burn and an aroma reminiscent of Christmas wreaths and Hot Tamales candy. That is, of course, if you decide to sip it or take it in a shot. If you choose to mix it with something, try it in a hot toddy or a glass of warm apple cider for a warm winter pick-me-up. Mancini himself enjoys his whiskey both neat and in a flask â€” the perfect portable guardian against Chicago's winter chill. \nTry it \nUntil Water Tower on Fire is bottled, you can try it only at the distillery, which boasts a full cocktail bar, 39 E.
