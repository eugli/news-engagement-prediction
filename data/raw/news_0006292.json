A White House statement released the same evening alleged that Yates “betrayed the Department of Justice.” \nDean tweeted Monday night that the statement following Yates' “attack” was “nasty” and a “new low.” The way the Trump presidency is beginning it is safe to say it will end in calamity. It is almost a certainty. Even Republicans know this! — John Dean (@JohnWDean) January 31, 2017 After serving as President Nixon’s lawyer from 1970 until 1973, Dean was deeply involved in events leading up to the Watergate scandal and subsequent cover-up. He pleaded guilty to a single felony count and became a key witness for the prosecution, which allowed him to serve a reduced prison sentence. \nThis isn’t the first time Dean has been critical of Trump and the Republican party in general—he was also an active supporter of efforts to impeach George W. Bush. Other recent tweets from Dean’s account say Trump “has no empathy,” and is “one cold heartless dude.” \nThis probably isn’t the last we’ll hear from Dean. Trump is not a Republican. So it's striking how he is using them and they him to get what each wants. It's pure political swamp politics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:18:26.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
