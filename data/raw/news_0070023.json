It’s been a few years so it was time for a return to science-fiction-land, much to the undoubted chargrin of science communicators, palaeontologists and museum professionals who are probably already fielding questions about mammoths’ proposed return to the land of the living. \nWe’re told that scientists are “ on the brink ” of resurrecting mammoths through some whizz bang science and some nice juicy quotes about the breakthrough being “in a couple of years”. The rest of the story and headlines write themselves. \nThis time, the bold comments come from Professor George Church, Harvard University, speaking ahead of the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting about the research team aiming to produce a hybrid elephant-mammoth embryo. \nAs ever, the usual media spin has sensationalised the research, downplaying the reasonable bits and emphasising some of the more outrageous pull quotes to make it all sound like a feasible project. Woolly mammoth on verge of resurrection, scientists reveal Read more \nBut I wouldn’t book in your tickets for the opening of Pleistocene Park in a couple of years just yet (after your annual space flight, or moon trip if you’re particularly adventurous). Herds of mammophants pining for the fjords aren’t quite within the realm of what’s possible. Within a few years, at best, you’ll be pointed to a tube or dish of unidentified cellular matter and told that it’s slightly more mammoth than any other glob has been yet. \nThe science behind genetically modified mammoth flavoured elephants is currently firmly within the realm of science-fiction as this article by John Hawks nicely sums up . It’s not just space race level science, it is manned Jupiter-colonising mission level science. \nHowever, de-extinction is such a compelling and easy to understand in principle idea that it just won’t seem to go away. Referencing my last article about science communication , it’s easy to think that all we need to do is combine the test tube baby technology with a dash of that growing ears on mice tech with that time we brought the dinosaurs back using amber, scale it up and hey presto! Insta-mammoths. Just add water. And invent an artificial womb. And make fundamental advances in genetics. \nBut if bringing back mammoths via the medium of Asian elephants wasn’t outlandish enough for you, Professor Church goes even further into blue sky land by suggesting that the mammoth project’s two goals were to secure an alternative future for the endangered Asian elephant and help combat global warming by keeping the tundra cold by breaking snow cover. \nSo in addition to bringing Ol’ Hairy back via some, as yet, unpioneered science, we’re then confident enough to introduce these never before existed hybrid animals into a unique and challenging ecosystem to help save the planet. I’d suggest that they set their sights higher. Engineer these mammophants to grow endangered corals on their backs, excrete rare earth minerals for us to use in mobile phones and get them to eat plastic bottles and rogue plastic bags. And get them to grow hair in the colour of your favourite international brands whilst you are at it. \nIs there harm in the hype (which I’m now perpetuating)? As John Hawks points out, in modern language this falls squarely into the fake news category. Yet I can almost guarantee that museum visitors will ask me about bringing mammoths back as if it is a firm possibility just around the corner. \nPersonally, I think that boosting ambitious claims like this one does send out the wrong messages about extinction, biological conservation and responsibility. One of the rare instances when scientists break kayfabe, is when a modern species goes extinct beyond saving. Every extinction is the end of a unique billions-year-old unbroken evolution that, when we’re responsible for contributing towards, should be something to be mourned. To suggest that we can “science it back” undermines the ongoing effort to save every sad species on the brink. If we can “re-wild” a mammoth-themed elephant hybrid, surely it’s a doddle to do the same for all these species currently extinct in the wild perpetuated by expensive breeding programs and hand rearing programs in zoos, aquaria and conservation centres. \nEven if it were a little bit more in the realms of possibility, are mammoths even a sensible starting point? What about the living species on the brink of existence ? Even living relatives of the mammoths, those conservation icons, stars of wildlife documentaries, the majestic elephants are in need of managing. The African Forest elephant isn’t even assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature or recognised by wildlife trade legislation. Surely that’s more of a priority than elephoths? \nOf course, animals have been brought back from extinction before. The extinct Pyrenean ibex subspecies was brought back using tissue from the last known individual for under ten minutes in 2003, before suffocating due a lung defect. Subsequent efforts on de-extincting the subspecies were to focus on cloning and selectively breeding clones with a closely related subspecies. \nWhich brings us back to the mammophants. Even if “a couple of years” was a reality, what is it that we’re bringing back? A cross-bred, artificial, clone, hybrid is always going to be a clumsy human approximation of what it is that we’ve lost. Is it a vanity project? Will the new techniques allow us to bring back more recently extinct animals so we can feel better about drinking bottled water or taking long plane journeys? Or are we attempting to use science to fudge a cosmetically similar hybrid just because we can? If it’s the latter, let’s just tape some carpet to an elephant and photoshop it into a tundra scene and move on.
