No, I've got thick skin and I've been in this game for 30-odd years and I've been called a lot worse and been through tougher times,\" he said. \n\"But I think it's completely inappropriate for my children, my family (to see that). \n\"On top of that, all those young kids who turned up, with their parents to watch the game. I don't think it has any place in Australian sport. \nAsked if he would like an apology from the fans responsible, he replied: \"I would have probably liked one (before) now, I haven't heard from them for four days, so I don't want one (an apology) now. \n\"At the end of the day I would have hoped I would have got an apology, I didn't get one, so that's life and we move on.\" Banner says enough about fans involved: Arnold \nWhen asked what he would say to the fans if he had the chance, Arnold was blunt about the effect of the incident on his family. \n\"I probably wouldn't have anything to say to them, because for them to think of that banner says enough (about them),\" he said. \n\"I think they might need a new artist, it doesn't really look too much like me. \n\"But my family are upset, to the (point) where my girls have come to every football game I've coached and played since I can remember, and they don't want to come any more. \n\"So it's a strong statement from my girls and my wife, my wife is extremely upset, but no apology so we've got to get on with it.\" Photo: The FFA has handed the Wanderers a show cause notice relating to the behaviour of fans. (AAP: Dean Lewins, File) \nThe FFA has handed the Wanderers a show cause notice and described the banner as \"totally unacceptable and offensive\". \nWanderers chief executive John Tsatsimas confirmed the club would respond to the notice, while outlining its disgust with the banner. \nHowever the Wanderers supporter group, the Red and Black Bloc, remains defiant and unapologetic on its Facebook page. \nThey have even suggested launching a new range with the lewd image. \nArnold was asked for his thoughts about the response of the FFA to the incident. \n\"I don't know if it's actually been settled yet, I don't read the papers and I don't get involved, so I think what we have to do first is let the FFA deal with it, let the Wanderers deal with what they've got to deal with, and obviously we've got a football game on Friday night we need to win.\" \nEventually, Arnold shut down further questions on the topic. \n\"Let's talk about Melbourne City, I think I've said enough about it at the end of the day. It's not right in football, it's not right in Australian sport overall. Do you guys agree?\".
