Trump imposes new Iran sanctions \n“The bedrock of this country is immigration and really a great separation between church and state,” said Shahid. “Even for the country, it’s not good as the order could deny entry to some of the tens of thousands of people who can contribute to the making of America.” \nShahid further added that he had thought that Trump would moderate his views on immigrants and Muslims after he took office but he was surprised and disappointed to see the president still sticking to his extremist views. US Attorney General named for ‘courage award’ after defying Trump’s travel ban \nShahid, however, praised the federal judge who temporarily blocked the president’s immigration order. “We have to look at it based on what can we do to make a difference,” he said. “And right now, there are enough forces in power and play that we have to see how this thing ends up.” \nDespite his opposition to Trump’s immigration policies, Shahid has been a vocal supporter of the Republicans and even voted for Trump because he supported his economic policies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:09:57.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
