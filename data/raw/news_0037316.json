Every time I watch the video my palms go sweaty.” \nThe photoshoot took place at the top of Dubai’s Cayan Tower which is 73 storeys high and was the world’s tallest building when it opened in 2013. A post shared by Viki Odintcova (@viki_odintcova) on Jan 26, 2017 at 6:55am PST \nBut some of the models fans were unimpressed and slammed the “reckless” stunt. \nOne person commented on her Instagram post: “Crazy! Looks like god gave you beauty but seems like he forgot to grace you with a brain.” \nAnother Instagram user said: “How can you disregard your life like that?” \nWhile another wrote: “So irresponsible and stupid. What if people try to copy this? \n“Proving beauty doesn't equal intelligence. Speechless by the amount of stupidity. No apparent safety equipment or precautions. \n“If this becomes a trend I really will lose faith in humanity.” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:06:19.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
