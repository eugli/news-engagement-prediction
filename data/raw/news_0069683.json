It was, and the Orange got that win in the most dramatic fashion possible. \nWith the game tied at 75, Syracuse guard John Gillon raced down the floor and hit a buzzer-beater as time expired to give the Orange a wild, 78-75 win over Duke. John Gillon just beat Duke at the buzzer with a banked-in three. What a game. pic.twitter.com/VuGHdhxJb5 \n— Rob Dauster (@RobDauster) February 23, 2017 \nTo call this shot “huge” would be an understatement. It was a monumental, potential season-altering victory. With the win the Orange now improve to 17-12 and while they still have work to do, a victory over a red-hot Duke team (which had won seven straight entering this game) was exactly the kind of resume boosting win that could get the Orange into the Big Dance. \nSyracuse still has games remaining at No. 7 Louisville and against Georgia Tech at home but this is one they needed. And they got it thanks to guard John Gillon. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:35:32.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
