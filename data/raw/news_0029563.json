Here's what a single line of unlimited data on each carrier costs: AT&T: $100/month (in addition to the required DirectTV/U-verse service so total cost is $150/month) Sprint: $55/month (with a $5/month AutoPay discount) T-Mobile One: $70/month (with a $5/month AutoPay discount) Verizon: $80/month (with a $5/month AutoPay discount) \nA couple notes on theses plans: The plans for AT&T, Sprint and Verizon do not include taxes, surcharges or additional fees At the time of this writing, Sprint has a promotion where its unlimited data plan is only $50/month through March 31, 2018. Cost for additional lines \nIf you need additional lines of unlimited data, each of the big four have a range of prices: AT&T: $100/month first line, $40/month for each additional line Sprint: $55/month first line, $40/month for a 2nd line, $30/month for lines 3-5 T-Mobile: $100/month for first two lines, or $47/month each for three lines, or $40 each for four lines Verizon: $80/month first line, $45/month for each additional line \nSprint's current promotion offers a 2nd line for $40/month and lines 3-5 for $0/month -- this reverts back to regular pricing after March 31, 2018. \nEach carrier has different rules around streaming hd video. HD video versus SD video \nVerizon and T-Mobile both offer HD video streaming included in their plans -- T-Mobile changed this in reaction to Verizon's announcement of its unlimited plan. AT&T does something similar, but defaults video streaming to standard definition (480p instead of 1080p). AT&T let's you disable this at no cost. \nThe baseline unlimited plan from Sprint only lets you stream standard definition video (think DVD quality). Though, Sprint offers a premium unlimited plan for $75/month that lets you stream HD video. \nBelow is the cost of an unlimited plan with HD video streaming for a single line: AT&T - $100/month ($150/month with required DirectTV/U-verse service) Sprint Premium - $75/month Verizon - $80/month Mobile hotspot data \nIf you use your phone as a mobile hotspot, keep in mind each carrier has its own limits on just how much data can be used for that -- this is one of the biggest differentiators between unlimited plans. Verizon - 10GB/month of mobile hotspot data T-Mobile - 10GB/month of mobile hotspot data Sprint - 5GB/month of mobile hotspot data on either of Sprint's unlimited plans AT&T Unlimited - mobile hotspot only available when connected with a smart car The final word \nIt is truly wonderful to have options from all four major US carriers for unlimited data plans. This comparison of costs and features is just part of the picture though. Keep in mind other costs: cost of phone, extended warranties, taxes, surcharges and activation fees -- the last three T-Mobile have factored into its pricing. It's also worth considering the network coverage and quality of that coverage, too.
