Read more The reclusive manga artist and his man-eating giants \nMr Taniguchi was widely praised for the gentle manner in which he approached subjects that were often unique for Japan's manga consumers. \nHis works such as The Walking Man, The Summit of the Gods and The Magic Mountain, stood apart in a genre sometimes seen as rooted in extreme violence and pornography. \nIn The Walking Man, the protagonist of the story simply wanders around fascinated with aspects of everyday life. \nMr Taniguchi was \"extraordinarily kind and gentle,\" Casterman said in a statement. \n\"The humanism that imbued all his work is familiar to his readers, but the man himself was much less well-known, naturally reserved in character and more inclined to let his work speak on his behalf,\" the publisher added.

Perhaps it is because my work is similar to Western comics, which I've followed for 30 years and they have influenced my subconscious,\" he said. \nMr Taniguchi's detailed landscapes filled with cartoon characters drew comparisons in the West with European comic heroes such as Tintin. \nBorn in 1947 in the city of Tottori, Mr Taniguchi had his first cartoon published in 1970. Many years later his graphic art took off in France and in 2015 his work was featured at the annual Angouleme international comics festival.
