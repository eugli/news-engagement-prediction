Walsh has terminal brain cancer. \nVicki Walsh thought the freedom and adrenaline rush of a hard-run race was lost to her forever. \nBut on Sunday night, thanks to the help of a friend, she went to bed with her Round the Bays half marathon medal still on. \nA formerly avid runner, Walsh, 49, has glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer, and has difficulty walking after suffering two strokes. Kevin Stent \nVicki Walsh and Maree Morpeth after crossing the finish line in the Round the Bays half marathon. \n\"That ship had sailed for me. It was a part of my life I missed immensely and I thought I'd never get back,\" Walsh said. \nIt's no surprise then that as the Manawatu woman completed Sunday's half marathon in Wellington, pushed in a wheelchair by friend Maree Morpeth, both women were in tears. Supplied \nMorpeth pushes Walsh through the course. \n\"When we came over that finish line, I could not control myself. \n\"We got over that line and gave ourselves a sweaty hug and said 'we did it'.\" \nWalsh and Morpeth used to run the Manawatu Gorge track every weekend prior to Walsh's first stroke in May 2011. The stroke led to the discovery of the glioblastoma multiforme, and she was given 12-14 months to live. Supplied \nWalsh and Morpeth with their finishing medals. \n\"Up until then we used to run every weekend. [Now] I can't walk properly, let alone run.\" \nThe pair, competing as team \"I'm possible\", finished the 21 kilometre run in 2 hours, 36 minutes. \nWalsh said Morpeth deserved all the credit. Supplied \nWalsh and her modified wheelchair compete in the Round the Bays half marathon in Wellington. \n\"When she got out there, she never missed a beat. I was so proud of her. She is just an incredible person. \n\"She never stopped. Not once.\" \nWalsh was still on a runner's high after the event. \n\"I slept with my medal on.\" \nBut the weekend's race was just the beginning. The pair aim to do three half marathons this year, and with Wellington ticked off, they're eyeing up Taupo in August and Hamilton in October. \nThey've got a bit more training to do before hitting the hills in Taupo though. \n\"Our only goal is to beat ourselves,\" Walsh said. \nMorpeth said she could see how much the run meant to Walsh. \n\"For me it was all about Vicki, to get that emotion back into her and make her feel like she can do all these things again. \n\"She is such a fit and active person on the inside, yet her body doesn't let her [run]. \nWalsh's wheelchair was modified to make it easier to push. \n\"Hopefully [our run] will inspire other people to do the same,\" Morpeth said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:12:47.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
