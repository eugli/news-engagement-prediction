He said he would withdraw his resignation and continue as chief minister if the people and party cadre wanted him to. Following his statement, the ruling AIADMK has replaced him with Dindigul Srinivasan, as the party's new treasurer. “Someone chosen by the grassroots cadre should be the general secretary; one acceptable to the people should be the chief minister. I am prepared to stand alone and fight on this, I am ready for it,” said Panneerselvam, addressing the media on Tuesday night. Speaking at the Jayalalithaa memorial on Marina beach, where he meditated for a few minutes before addressing the media, Panneerselvam said the spirit of the former chief minister had prodded him into revealing the truth — that he was forced to ask AIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala to take over the chief minister's post from him, after his own ministers openly rebelled against him by placing the demand out in public. The first to make such a demand was Revenue Minister RB Udhayakumar, just after a few days of Paneerselvam taking oath after Jayalalithaa's death. Soon after other joined in. 'Sellur' K Raju and KA Sengottaiyan, who had fallen out of favour with Jayalalithaa when she was alive and was then brought back to prominence in the party by Sasikala after she took over as party general secretary, pressed for the change in command too. “If it were personal insults, I would have taken it in my stride as part of public life. However, this insulted the position and the party itself. I was hurt,” Panneerselvam said. On Sunday, when Sasikala was elected as the leader of the legislative party by the MLAs, Panneerselvam said he had asked the reason for the haste. He said he had spoken to Sasikala when his ministers raised the demand in public, and that she had assured him that they were chided about it and asked not to speak of the matter again. \"But soon enough a legislature party meeting was called,\" said Panneerselvam, \"in which I was pressured further saying I should not let the party unity be affected and I should, therefore, do what's in the party's best interest.\" He said he told the gathered MLAs that he wanted to spend some time at Jayalalithaa's memorial and think over it before taking a decision, but they insisted that he make the decision then and there. He then acquiesced to their demands, he said, under pressure. Recalling the efforts taken by his government, including the relief work during Cyclone Vardah, the initiative to meet Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu to seek drinking water for Chennai, and finally the handling of the jallikattu protests, he said this had irked Sasikala and family. Stating that his conscience was not letting him keep mum anymore, Panneerselvam said he would fight, even if alone, to ensure that someone that had the support of the people — and not just the MLAs — would become the chief minister. It was an unexpected turn of events in Tamil Nadu politics when Panneerselvam landed unannounced at Jayalalithaa’s memorial at 8.50 pm, where he sat in silent prayer. There was tension building up by the minute as he sat motionless for 50 minutes before finally speaking to the media. It is not yet clear how many party MLAs are with Panneerselvam. Perhaps as a sign of things to come, the ministers and many MLAs have rushed to Poes Garden immediately after Panneerselvam’s shock public revolt. At least a few of the leaders have already begun criticising Panneerselvam during television debates, but a coherent strategy has not yet been formulated. Speaking to TV channels, AIADMK spokesperson Apsara Reddy lambasted former chief minister O Panneerselvam, saying what he was doing was not right as he did not have the backing of the MLAs, and that it was party general secretary VK Sasikala that the legislature party had chosen as chief minister. \nAIADMK parliamentary party leader M Thambidurai, while reacting to Paneerselvam's charges, said that the opposition DMK was behind the entire incident. \nHe also asserted that VK Sasikala would swear in as the new Tamil Nadu Chief Minister. \n\"AIADMK will continue in power for the remaining tenure of four and a half years,\" he said while adding that 134 MLAs stood united at the Poes Garden. \nOn the other hand, AIADMK Rajya Sabha MP V Maitreyan and Parithi Ellamvazhuthi extended their support to Panneerselvam. \nAs per sources, the ruling party MLAs are set to meet at 10 am today morning. \nAIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala who addressed party cadre at Poes Garden accused DMK's hand behind O Paneerselvam's charges. Social media has been buzzing with dissent about the decision to make Sasikala the next chief minister, ever since the party made the announcement. Sasikala was set to be sworn in today but there has been uncertainty over it as Tamil Nadu Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao, who is also in charge of Maharashtra, has not yet returned to Chennai following his trip outstation. This development has given rise to rumours that the Centre-ruling BJP has a role to play in this drama. That Governor Vidyasagar Rao, who accepted Panneerselvam’s resignation, has not yet chosen to install Sasikala as chief minister is also seen as another indicator of the Centre’s interest in propping up Panneerselvam. Sources said there was division within the BJP over the way the party is involved in these developments. One section supported Sasikala while the other is looking at installing a chief minister who could be controlled by the Centre. The next episode of this drama will be clear only after the governor arrives in Chennai. There are rumours that Governor Rao might reach Chennai on Wednesday, though it has not been confirmed yet.
