Diego is a really important player. The situation is very clear, he is very happy to stay with us and fight for the title.'\nCosta is his side's leading goalscorer with 15 goals and is only one behind Romelu Lukaku, who leads the league's goalscoring charts.\nAnd while the striker is only contracted to Stamford Bridge for two more years, Conte is confident that he will stay in west London beyond the summer of 2019.\nAfter a furious row in January, Chelsea boss Conte and Costa managed to patch things up\nCosta is Chelsea's leading goalscorer with 15 in the Premier League to his name this season\n'I think (he will stay for some time),' Conte said. 'I see him every day and his commitment and behaviour. He loves this club.'\nBut despite believing Costa will stay loyal to his club and the fans, the Chelsea boss said he does fear the growing attraction of China and their vast reserves of money.\nHe cited the example of Oscar's £60million switch from Chelsea to Shanghai SIPG.\n'It's very difficult to manage these situations. £60million for Oscar, also a lot of money for the players,' Conte said.\nOscar joined Shanghai SIPG from Chelsea for £60m and arrived in China in January\nOscar celebrates scoring the opening goal in Shanghai SIPG's victory over Sukhothai\nIf the football's on, it's on Live tables Fixtures Scores Premier League Premier League Championship League One League Two Scottish Premiership Scottish Div 1 Scottish Div 2 Scottish Div 3 Ligue 1 Serie A La Liga Bundesliga More tables More fixtures More scores The 47-year-old is concerned that the sums being spoken about can only help to push football's elite level further away from its roots.\n'I think it's not the right way to pay a lot of money,' he added.\n'The players to keep them in a club we must always have the right vision, the right vision, and stand the right way and not lose the right way because if we lose the right way it's not a good example for the young players [and] for the people in general who have to work every day.'\nThe Blues travel to Burnley on Sunday afternoon. A 20th league win would take them to 62 points and potentially 12 points above second-placed Tottenham.\nConte hasn't allowed himself a moment to switch off or begin to believe that the club's sixth top division league title is wrapped up despite sending a message to their rivals.\nAsked whether he thought the title race was over, he replied: ‘No, no. Now we are top of the table but this league is very tough.\n'For me now it's very important to continue to push and to exploit this momentum but of course if you send the right signal it is very important.’", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=92172392&iu=/5765/dailymail.uk", "https://pixel.adsafeprotected.com/rfw/st/60025/9852880/skeleton.gif", "https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/ad/N33505.2292307MAILONLINE_UK_DAW/B9964859.134304502;sz=1x1;ord=", "http://i.mol.im/sport/football/footballtable/production/js/footballtable-29.0.0-0.min.js", "https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/306947776;134304502;g", "http://i.mol.im/sport/football/footballtable/production/css/football_at_glance-29.0.0-0.min.css"], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T05:36:40.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
