Lisa Schencker announced his travel ban.\nAlsayed urged them to still consider him for their residency programs despite the fact that he's from Sudan, one of seven Muslim-majority countries mentioned in Trump's executive order temporarily banning citizens of those countries from entering the U.S. \n\"I was really excited all my interviews went well and I could start ranking programs and hopefully match for next year,\" said Alsayed, who's been living in Chicago for two years on a visa, taking exams and applying for residencies in hopes of working as a doctor here. \"Then came this executive order and everything became so confusing, so stressful.\" \nThough courts have suspended the ban for now, the continuing uncertainty surrounding its ultimate fate has international medical school graduates and teaching hospitals on edge as they prepare for one of their biggest days of the year — Match Day on March 17. It's the day when medical school graduates and students find out at which hospitals they'll do their residencies — putting into practice what they learned in medical school and honing their skills as doctors. \nAspiring residents like Alsayed wonder if they'll be turned away from hospitals that don't want to deal with the potential hassle of hiring physicians who would be subject to a travel ban. And hospitals worry whether the residents they choose will be barred from working in the U.S., leaving them short-handed to care for patients and, over time, making a shortage of doctors in the U.S. more acute. \nTrump recently defended the travel ban calling it \"very important for the country\" and saying \"we have to have security in our country.\" \nBut hospitals in Illinois and across the nation rely heavily on doctors from abroad. \nLast year, about 14 percent of residents who matched through the main matching program — more than 3,700 people — were non-U.S. citizens who graduated from medical schools outside the U.S., according to the National Resident Matching Program. This year, more than 42,000 people are expected to apply for 32,000 residency spots across the country, in all.

(Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) \nIt would be \"disastrous for not only medical education but bad for patient care\" if hospitals can't get the residents they choose because of the travel ban, said Dr. Fred Zar, program director of the internal medicine residency at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine. \n\"If we lose that part of the workforce because we can't get enough people in our residency programs because these countries are banned, the ability to take care of the volumes of patients we care for (is) diminished,\" Zar said. \"It's got very deep-running ramifications for health care.\" \nZar's particular program doesn't have many residents from other countries, but others certainly do, he said. \nThe American Medical Association has asked the Trump administration for guidance on Trump's order to ensure it doesn't keep out qualified med school grads or leave hospitals with unfilled training spots. \nHospitals' reliance on residents from other countries varies based on the institution and the specialty. Residency programs in popular specialties at top tier hospitals might not have as many doctors from other countries because so many American medical school grads want to work in them, and Americans might be easier to interview and hire, said Mark Smith, president of Merritt Hawkins, a placement firm specializing in physicians. But less prominent hospitals and less popular specialties might rely more on foreign doctors. \nThose hospitals could suffer — including financially — if a ban keeps their top choices for residents from entering the U.S. If a resident is selected for a spot at a hospital and then can't follow through because of a ban, some hospitals will still likely be able to fill the spot with a bit of scrambling, but others may not. \n\"The resident plays a critical role in not just the care-providing of a hospital but also the financial viability of a hospital,\" Smith said. Residents make an average of $56,500 a year, according to a 2016 Medscape report, but they work up to 80 hours a week. \"They're the cheapest labor you have.\" \nHospitals could hedge their bets by simply avoiding those international residents. The National Resident Matching Program is \"concerned\" that hospitals might not rank those applicants, said Mona Signer, program president and CEO. \nThe program recently released a statement urging medical educators to support international medical graduate students and \"make the best decisions they can under current circumstances.\" \n\"The affected applicants have worked hard for many years to achieve their goal of becoming physicians, and they should not be denied that opportunity because of a blanket policy that does not consider the individual,\" according to the statement. \"Similarly, U.S. training programs should be able to select applicants based on their excellent character and qualifications, without regard to nationality.\" \nRush University Medical Center has already decided not to take applicants' nationality into account as it ranks its top choices for residents this year, said Dr. Richard Abrams, associate dean of graduate medical education at Rush. \nIt's possible that approach could leave Rush with last-minute vacancies. Abrams estimates about 10 percent of Rush's residents attended medical school in other countries and about 10 of its current residents and fellows are from the seven countries in question.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:16:10.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
