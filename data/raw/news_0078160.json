The comments came after the high-profile resignation of Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn. \n\"Either Trump has not gained the requisite independence and he is consequently being not unsuccessfully backed into a corner, or Russophobia has already infected the new administration also from top to bottom,\" MP Konstantin Kosachev said, according to news reports out of the country. \nKosachev's counterpart at the lower chamber of the Russian parliament, Alexei Pushkov, tweeted shortly after the announcement that \"it was not Flynn who was targeted but relations with Russia.\" \nFederal investigators in the U.S. have been looking into possible contacts between Trump advisers and Russia for months, along with Russia's role in political hacking during the campaign. \nTrump has denied knowing that any of his campaign advisers were in contact with Russians during the campaign. He has also said he has no financial ties or other connections to Russia. \nThe GOP chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, said that so far, he has not received any evidence from the intelligence community that anyone in Trump's orbit was in contact with Russians during the presidential campaign. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report Advertisement ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:11:41.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
