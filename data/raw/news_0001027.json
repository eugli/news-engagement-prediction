The settlement addressed police stops in and around buildings whose landlords had asked the police to conduct patrols and arrest trespassers under a city-run program. The agreement prohibits officers from approaching, questioning or detaining people merely because they are inside or around those buildings, and forces officers to apply the same constitutional protections there that they are supposed to apply anywhere in the city. Some civil rights lawyers have said the practice, under the Trespass Affidavit Program, was an especially poisonous element of the city’s stop-and-frisk efforts because people were questioned or detained steps from their own apartments or those of friends or relatives. The lawyers say officers often stopped and searched people who were hanging out in the lobbies of enrolled buildings, and questioned them about trespassing simply for having walked out of a building. “What was driving all of that was a general belief by police officers that people who were in or near these buildings could be stopped without anything else,” said Christopher Dunn, associate legal director for the New York Civil Liberties Union and lead counsel in the suit in 2012. “That is at the heart of these new standards, which make it clear police officers cannot do that.” A federal judge in 2013 ruled one element of this practice unconstitutional , focusing specifically on stops in front of enrolled buildings in the Bronx, where the program was known as Clean Halls. The judge, Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District Court in Manhattan, said the Police Department had “systematically crossed” the line between constitutional and unconstitutional activity by stopping people without reasonable suspicion that they were trespassing. \nAdvertisement   The settlement announced Thursday addresses the broader program of stops inside and outside buildings in the Bronx and other boroughs, with the police agreeing to new training and supervisory methods and at least five years of court jurisdiction over the changes. “A person’s mere presence in or near, entry into, or exit out of a TAP Building does not constitute an objective credible reason to approach,” the settlement says. Walking through an apartment-building door that is broken or propped ajar also should not be reason enough for someone to be detained, the settlement says. Revisions to the Police Department’s Patrol Guide also instruct officers to avoid making people feel as if they are not free to leave when there is not reasonable suspicion that they were trespassing, and advise officers that under appropriate circumstances they can ask someone to leave rather than arrest the person. Officers will also be forced to document such encounters more thoroughly. The Police Department agreed to pay $235,000 to the 13 plaintiffs. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
