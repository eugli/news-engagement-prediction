Most dogs who had seen the actor refuse help opted for the treat from the neutral person. Those who had seen the actor help, took the treat from them. The paper reports this could be a dog showing 'social eavesdropping' skills. The study said: 'Pet dogs are not merely passive observers of other individuals' interactions. 'Instead, in some circumstances at least, they pay attention to the outcome of the interaction, evaluate how the actors behave and make use of that information in reaching a decision about which individuals to interact with or avoid.' There is more work to be done to establish if the skill would only work if the dog's owner is involved.
