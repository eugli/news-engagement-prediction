However the former Chelsea number one has looked a little suspect recently. \nThe Reds were linked with a move for the goalie in December but Claudio Ranieri was adamant at that point that his keeper wouldn't be moving: \n\"He is under contract and we won't sell him under any circumstances. Not even big money. We don't need the money. There's no chance. \n\"I'm sorry for Liverpool but they can win the title without Kasper.\" \nBut if the Foxes were to be relegated then they would likely have no option but to sell the son of legendary Manchester United goalie Peter Schmeichel. \nManchester City have reportedly also shown interest in their former player after Claudio Bravo has failed to live up to expectations this season.
