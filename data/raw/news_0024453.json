Derek Green said officers arrived at the store \"to maintain order,\" adding that there were no incidents during their time there. \nInitially, the retailer was going to give the first 26 people in line a sofa and the next 100 customers an armchair. However, because of the large number of people waiting in line, store officials decided to give the furniture away via a lottery, Roth said. \n\"We weren't sure what to expect,\" he said about the size of the crowd. \nDespite the small hiccup early in the morning, shoppers patiently waited in line — some for hours — to get a chance to be one of the first people in the new store. \nSilver Lake resident Martha Hernandez, 45, arrived at IKEA at around 7:30 a.m. and found herself on the outer fringes of the parking lot with several hundred people in front of her. \n\"IKEA is always a good place to shop,\" she said. \"I like the atmosphere. They always have good sales. I always buy furniture here, and it's close to home.\" \nHernandez said that she frequented the original Burbank IKEA, located a little more than a mile away on North San Fernando Boulevard in the Burbank Town Center. It opened in 1990 and was IKEA's first store in California. \nThough the former store was smaller — 242,000 square feet — Hernandez that she liked seeing the showrooms change there every time she visited. \n\"There was always something new,\" she said.

You have space to go around, and you're not bothering other people.\" \n--", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:14:59.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
