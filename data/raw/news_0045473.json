As the more formal portion of the meeting delved into his extensive plans to involve the community in redevelopment efforts, he invoked one of his favorite mantras. \n\"Either you're at the table or you're on the menu,\" he said, provoking laughter in the church complex, which sits just west of the Metra South Shore line on 63rd Street. The library , in his view, will be the catalyst for renewed investor interest in the mid-South Side. \nThe Pentecostal minister is at the table in a big way. And it comes just as the Obama project is gaining traction, with former President Barack Obama paying a surprise visit to Chicago last week to corral community support. The Rev. Byron Brazier Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune The Rev. Byron Brazier takes a walk around the East Woodlawn neighborhood talking about development of the area near the future site of the Obama library on Feb. 6, 2017. The Rev. Byron Brazier takes a walk around the East Woodlawn neighborhood talking about development of the area near the future site of the Obama library on Feb. 6, 2017. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) \nNot only does Dr. Brazier, as he is affectionately known among his flock, have longstanding ties to the Obama family, the University of Chicago and Mayor Rahm Emanuel — he serves as a leading point person for engaging the community in revitalization plans and was among a handful of civic leaders to meet with Obama last week — but his church is also the largest private owner of land that hugs 63rd Street and is prime for development near the library site. \nThat land, used as parking lots, sits within what will most likely be the most coveted development sites near the library. For all his enthusiasm for revitalizing the area's economy, Brazier said that the church has no plans to sell or redevelop the land. \nThis is an important juncture for the 66-year-old IBM executive-turned-minister, who spent decades in the shadow of his revered father, the late Bishop Arthur M. Brazier. With the Obama library representing a once-in-a-lifetime cash infusion for the stalled-out South Side, Brazier's organizational skills will be put to their biggest test yet. His challenge will be to help steer a wide-reaching rebirth, building on the halting progress made by past leaders. And many will be watching closely to see just who reaps any benefits rippling from the Obama library. \n\"Dr. Brazier, your daddy's legacy was what Woodlawn has continued to become,\" community resident Ronald Parker said during the church meeting. \"I'd like to see what your legacy will become, what our future is.\" (Kathy Bergen) \nThe hurdle is a high one. \"Woodlawn is always on the cusp, but never quite getting there,\" said Kim Goluska, an urban planner who has done extensive work on the South Side. \nFor the few businesses and residents who invested in the corridor, the pace of neighborhood planning and development has proven frustrating. \n\"How many meetings do you have to have?\" asked David Blackmon, a Chicago Public School administrator who together with his wife moved in 2003 into a new single-family home built by a partnership that included the senior Brazier. \nThe couple paid $300,000 for a brick-front two-story home with three bedrooms, three baths, hardwood floors and granite countertops, only to see the value decline and lots remain empty along the 63rd Street corridor to the west. \nIt's not all for naught — a University of Chicago charter school is being built on a nearby empty lot, and he remains hopeful that the library and a proposed PGA-level golf course in Jackson Park will spur development. But it's not what they expected when they purchased their house in the Columbia Pointe development.

(Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) \n\"I would like to see what I bought into — either houses or condos,\" he said, adding that some restaurants would be nice, too. \nThe only dining establishment nearby is Robust Coffee, a retro-chic cafe that opened in 2010 across from a lot where the Columbia Pointe development had been expected to continue. It remains empty. \n\"There is almost too much conversation for what actually gets done,\" said Jake Sapstein, co-owner of the shop. \nPrevious efforts \nThis isn't the first go-round at revitalization. \nIn 1990s, the elder Brazier, a prominent civil rights leader who transformed Apostolic from a 100-member community church into a regional power with around 20,000 members, viewed a stretch of CTA \"L\" tracks running above 63rd Street as an \"impediment to development\" in eastern Woodlawn. \nHe and another community organizer-turned-developer, the Rev. Leon Finney Jr., who heads the Woodlawn Community Development Corp., persuaded the CTA to tear down a mile-long leg from Cottage Grove Avenue to Dorchester, where Brazier's church sat in the shadow of the then-defunct tracks and the shuttered businesses beneath them. Finney's nonprofit had acquired property along 63rd Street.

(Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune) See more videos \nAs Brazier campaigned for the demolition, and in the years immediately after the tracks were torn down in 1997, Apostolic bought properties along the stretch as well — most at a discount or for unpaid taxes. In some cases, the city retained the right to approve future plans if parking lots were transformed for another use. \nMuch of the land acquired by the two entities has since sat, either undeveloped or used for parking. \nFinney's nonprofit still owns a handful of vacant lots along the stretch. \nApostolic, though, owns more. The church holds title to more than 40 parcels, currently used as parking lots, that are clustered around the Metra Electric District Station at 63rd Street and Dorchester Avenue . Most were bought from the city and Apostolic paid just more than $550,000 through a series of transactions between 1982 and 2004, a Tribune analysis of property records found. Today, that would buy two of the homes that were developed along the stretch. \nThe goal of the train's tear-down was to kickstart new housing that could help spur retail development. Through a partnership involving the senior Brazier, Finney and another developer, Allison Davis, a couple blocks of single-family homes were built along 63rd Street, the Columbia Pointe development. Obama library: Latest stories, photos, commentary Open link \nThen the housing-market crashed. Less than a fifth of the planned 200 homes anticipated for the second phase of the development were ultimately built, leaving yawning tracts of empty lots to the west. Retail development on the corridor has been scant. An \"L\" line that could have dropped visitors a few blocks from the Obama library site is gone. \n\"In hindsight, we know the importance of transportation,\" said Ald. Willie Cochran, whose 20th Ward includes Apostolic, where he is a member. \nBrazier's moment \nNow the challenge falls to the younger Brazier, who ascended into leadership of the church after his father retired in 2008, and has gradually made his mark as the senior pastor. \nHe makes no apologies for past moves or the pace of planning. \nThe \"L\" tracks were a barrier to development south of 63rd Street, he said, and single-family homes presented a way to \"build community wealth and make things better for individual families.\" \nBrazier sees himself as someone who can help neighborhood representatives be equal partners with the city, the university and the Obama Foundation as the library project moves forward. \nMayor Rahm Emanuel promised in a letter to the Barack Obama Foundation that the city would make infrastructure improvements and that he would lead the way in bringing new investments to the surrounding neighborhoods, creating jobs and spurring economic growth. (Chicago Tribune) \nThrough an effort dubbed 1Woodlawn, in place for about 18 months so far, he is soliciting community ideas to be woven into a master plan for the redevelopment of Woodlawn. The next step is expected to be the launch of a not-for-profit agency to guide revitalization efforts in Woodlawn and the nearby South Shore and Washington Park neighborhoods. \n\"It is important that we plan for our own self-determination and not have someone else plan for us,\" Brazier told residents at the recent community meeting. \nAt nearly every turn, Brazier is front and center. \nThe Network of Woodlawn community group, led by Brazier, is working with the city, the Obama Foundation, the University of Chicago and the Washington Park Consortium to examine how South Side communities can benefit from the Obama library project. \nTo support that effort, Chicago Community Trust made a $250,000 grant to Chicago-based advisory firm Next Street to examine successful redevelopment projects around the country. The trust gave another $75,000 grant to the Arthur M. Brazier Foundation, also led by Brazier, for neighborhood planning services. The foundation retained architecture firm Skidmore Owings & Merrill to assist with that effort. And the Polk Bros. Foundation made a $45,000 grant to the Brazier Foundation to solicit community views. \nAll these endeavors will build on a 2015 neighborhood study conducted by architecture firm Gensler for the Network of Woodlawn, with the aim of shaping a neighborhood redevelopment strategy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:29:24.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
