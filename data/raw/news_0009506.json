The researchers called this phenomenon t he \"hour-glass ceiling.\"\nThe work week is not designed to accommodate domestic work.

They also point out that the popular limit on work weeks around the world, and in places like Europe — 48 hours — should possibly be revisited given the different burdens on men and women and how that affects workplace equality.\nImproving mental health might be tougher in the U.S., which has no standardized maximum workweek.\nBut, at the very least, policies that help working moms (like measures to reduce the cost of childcare), could help crack the hour-glass ceiling.\nPlus, there's a case for limiting work hours — that even employers might get on board with: People who work too much are less productive .\nSign up for The Payoff — your weekly crash course on how to live your best financial life.
