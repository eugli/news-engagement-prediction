abuse protection at Texas courthouse 1 / 46 Back to Gallery \"It really was a stunning event,\" Bernal said. \"It has an incredible chilling effect for all undocumented victims of any crime in our community.\"\nIt is county policy not to ask about citizen status, Bernal said, because officials want to make clear that all victims of crime in El Paso are entitled to the same protections within the criminal justice system.\nThe arrest of the domestic violence complainant comes at a time of considerable unrest and anxiety within the immigrant community nationwide as President Trump begins to make good on the strict immigration policies that defined his campaign. Since taking office just four weeks ago, Trump has threatened to cut off federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities and, he says, started the planning process for his Mexican border wall.\nMore stories from the border Abbott calls out alleged killer here illegally but 'sanctuary' ban wouldn't have stopped him There's already a border wall; this is what life around it looks like Historic photos transport viewer to 1930s alongTexas-Mexico border Report: Texas would be the state hardest hit from a trade war with Mexico Already the policies have led to the deportation of an undocumented mother from Arizona who, rather than dodge her check-in with immigration officials, dutifully went and was detained. In Seattle, a 23-year-old man who had been living legally in the U.S. under the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was arrested and detained last week by ICE officials who claimed he was a gang member, something his lawyers deny.\nAnd in Denver, an undocumented mother of four who had been living in the U.S. for 20 years sought refuge in the basement of a church this week rather than check-in with authorities, for fear she too would be deported.\nIn El Paso, Bernal said her office, which prosecutes criminal cases and represents alleged victims of domestic violence, like I.E.G., has felt the weight of this policy shift in recent weeks. Call volume has increased from concerned El Paso residents, she said, who have reported checkpoints in certain parts of town and the appearance of ICE agents at routine traffic stops.\nWhat concerns her and other local officials most of all, though, is how last week's courthouse incident could have a greater impact on the way crime is - or isn't - reported within the immigrant community.\n\"An incident like what happened in the courthouse last week really puts fear in people,\" Bernal said. \"One of the things that really worries me is that it only takes one isolated incident like this.\"\nWhether the courthouse stakeout was indeed an isolated incident remains unclear. An ICE spokeswoman declined to comment Wednesday in response to questions from El Paso Times reporter Marty Schladen, who first wrote about the case.\nBernal is trying to mitigate the situation and ease anxiety, she told The Post, by reaching out to Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, an El Paso native. The county attorney asked Beto Wednesday to set up a meeting with her office and the local ICE director to get \"assurance from ICE that this is an isolated incident and that this isn't going to happen again,\" Bernal said.\nAfter the courthouse incident last week, Bernal's office launched an investigation, which unearthed a narrative of the day's events that differs from the one outlined in court documents filed by ICE.\nBased on eyewitness accounts from several attorneys in Bernal's office, the judge who granted the undocumented woman's protective order and the victim's advocate assisting her, there were six ICE agents inside the courthouse that day - one inside the courtroom and others standing by the door and stairwells. They escorted her down the hallway, into the elevator and outside the building, where they detained her, Bernal said.\nThe narrative of the ICE affidavit, however, does not mention any contact inside the courthouse or the courtroom.\nThe affidavit claims that agents were \"conducting surveillance\" at the courthouse \"in attempts of seeing\" the woman. At 9:30 a.m., the affidavit says, agents saw the woman \"exiting the El Paso County Courthouse and proceeded to walk along the side walk on San Antonio Avenue.\" Agents identified themselves and questioned I.E.G., who admitted to being a Mexican citizen who was in the U.S. without legal status.\nAccording to the affidavit, I.E.G. has a criminal and immigration history that dates back to 2010 and includes numerous deportations and arrests for assault, violating probation, domestic violence, false imprisonment and possession of stolen mail.\nEven so, Bernal said \"it's hard to imagine how they would justify the rationale\" for staking out a courtroom that deals in granting protective orders.\n\"If that person was that dangerous, state law enforcement would have been looking for her,\" Bernal said. \"It doesn't make sense why the resources would be used to go after a victims of domestic abuse . . . it seems to be they are continuing to victimize our client.\"", "external_links":
