(Photo: 247Sports) \nThere was star power in Tennessee’s class — a group headlined by five-star offensive tackle Trey Smith, the nation’s No. 14 overall prospect in the 2017 industry-generated 247Sports Composite — and there were some really intriguing three-star prospects with more than enough upside to get the attention of analysts everywhere. \nRecruiting classes are always better judged a few years down the road, but Tennessee’s 2017 recruiting haul didn’t generate nearly the same level of buzz as the Vols’ back-to-back, top-10 classes in 2014 and 2015. Aside from Smith and a couple of other players — prospects like the Nashville-area duo of Ty Chandler and Maleik Gray , the nation’s No. 68 and No. 78 overall prospects in the 247Sports Composite — the Vols’ newest signing class also didn’t quite match the buzz from a 2016 class that was ranked No. 14 nationally. \nIf Jones was disappointed, though, he hid it very well. \nTo hear Jones talk, he and his staff absolutely love their 2017 signing class. \n“When I talk about dynamic players, you can also be an offensive lineman or a defensive lineman and be a dynamic football player,” Jones said. “As we all know, in the SEC it’s a line-of-scrimmage league, and we thought that we were able to address the depth concerns that we’ve had there in our program in the offensive and defensive lines, and also in the special teams game, as well. \n“I do want to guard against [overhyping] this class, though. I think it’s unfair to put any expectations on them at this point in time. As we all know, each individual develops differently at their own stage.” \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .) Tennessee 2017 five-star offensive line signee Trey Smith from University School of Jackson in Jackson, Tenn. (Photo: 247Sports) \nJones said the Vols met most of the needs — offensive line, defensive line, running back, wide receiver and kicker — they had entering the 2017 cycle, and that he was “really excited” to for the 22 new signees and preferred walk-ons to join the group of five signees who enrolled in January. \n“There was a number of needs in this class,” Jones said. “Obviously it starts up front with the offensive line, and any time you can add a [player the] caliber of Trey Smith — who had an opportunity go anywhere in the country and chose to stay at home — that’s a big element to that. Riley Locklear by some was the No. 1 center in America. And these individuals already have strength coming in, and then having them here for spring football I think will pay dividends for them and for our football program. And then obviously adding [K’Rojhn Calbert], as well. \n“We needed to add three running backs. That was very critical. You have to have depth at the running back position, and it starts with Ty Chandler , so we’re excited about, to be able to add the depth at the running back position, and then skill out on the perimeter. We had to balance in terms of slot receivers and individuals with great speed that could run reverses and do some misdirection things for you, but also the size. I’m ecstatic about Josh Palmer . He’s an individual who, I tell you, his story is tremendous. … Here’s a young man that chose to go to The States and play at St. Thomas Aquinas, and we all know about the legendary status of their football program and how you have to compete. He lived with family and had to drive an hour to school every single day, so he’s kind of been through the process of leaving home and going through the collegiate ranks, and also he gives us the size on the perimeter that we need. \n“Defensively we needed to improve our depth at the linebacker position, and it also lends itself on special teams, as well. And then obviously the back end of our defense [was improved], too. So, really, when you look at it, we’ve talked about the defensive front, but it was imperative that we take care of special teams with the kicker of the future, and with Brent Cimaglia we thought we were able to do that, as well.” \n\nContact Wes Rucker by email at wesrucker247@gmail.com or ON TWITTER , or FOLLOW GOVOLS247 ON FACEBOOK .
