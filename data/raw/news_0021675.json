When the Washington Post reported Trump's tense phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull , Souza posted a cheery photo of Obama laughing with Turnbull.\nAs Trump feuded with Mexico over the payment for his border wall, Souza offered up an image of Obama drinking with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.\nAnd, most recently, Souza posted an image of Obama in a well-lit meeting with the caption, \"Those damn lights ;)\" â€” a reference to a New York Times story that indicated Trump staffers were holding meetings in the dark due to their inability to figure out how to use the light switches .\nPete Souza has been photographing the President for 12 years.\nMedia: MediaOS Video Souza, who formerly worked at the Chicago Tribune, met Obama when Obama was a junior senator. Souza was asked to join the administration as the official White House photographer after Obama's election.\nRelated Stories Heavy rain, intense winds cause mayhem in Bay Area Thousands of PG&E customers across Bay Area without power Transients plead guilty in slayings of SF backpacker, Marin hiker Souza also served as the official photographer for President Ronald Reagan.
