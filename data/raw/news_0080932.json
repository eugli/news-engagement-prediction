Each bit pulled the skin and stung like a beesting. After about an hour of doing it for a few minutes, then stopping to rest and think of some new swearwords, I was only a third of the way across. \nMy wife Katherine thought I was being a wuss, and that I should just rip it off in one fell swoop. Trouble is, I thought that would hurt so much I'd jump around the room and knock something over, and, anyway, I pointed out to her, men's lower backs aren't the smooth, hairless, curvy niceties that ladies have - they are hairy and flabby. READ MORE: * A mild touch of the cancer: In which David discovers laughter is a pretty good medicine Pulling it off would be like giving myself a waxing on the lower back. \"Exactly my point,\" was her retort. After an hour or two of internal turmoil, and more stingy, tentative peeling, I gave in to her logic and ripped the bastard off. Didn't hurt a bit. Hard as nails, me. (And also, now smooth as silk). It's been a week of two halves really – the first half of the week was waiting for the chemo. Time spent at home, with Katherine, talking, reading, walking on the beach, having lunch together. It's been wonderful, an unexpected quiet time – magical, like a honeymoon in some ways, with one significant component missing (damn you again cancer). It's also been great timing as I have a book I am writing and needed to try to finish, so the time has been a bonus (it's a book on high tech New Zealand companies who are changing the face of the economy and successfully exporting globally. I'm writing it with my friend Michelle Dickinson [nanogirl] and it will be out later this year. Available soon in all good bookshops. OK, advertisement over now.) What's helped significantly with the writing is the major dose of steroids the doctor put me on, to get ready for the chemo treatment. She said it was likely to make me feel more energetic and positive, and it certainly has. I feel like I am on a mild coffee buzz the whole time. That does come with some unintended consequences – my heart rate is way up, and it's harder to sleep for a start. The other night I lay awake for ages then got up after two hours of my mind racing and wrote about four pages of ideas, notes, to-do lists and gags about cancer. Katherine and my 18-year-old son Superman were watching me laughing, saying I was hyper – I think they meant I was even more funny, creative and witty than normal. Superman said that if anything would kill me it was the speed that I was typing. \nPrednisone: The little chemical heart starter. \nThe biggest side-effect of the steroids so far though was completely unexpected, and much more debilitating. It's rare, but apparently 0.05 per cent of cancer-steroid takers get it. There is even a support group set up for it in the States (mind you, that's not saying much, they probably have support groups for people who can't peel plasters off). It sounds funny, but it's not – I got the hiccups (or hiccoughs, for the traditional spellers). Chronic hiccups. Not the cute little hiccups your nana gets at Christmas after she's had a couple of sherries – these are big, violent, painful hiccups. Steroid fuelled hiccups. It's as if the only muscle the steroids are enhancing is my diaphragm and now it's going up and down like a supertramp. They come for hours at a time, and when they do it's like Joseph Parker is punching me in the guts every 30 seconds. I wouldn't mind if I was getting paid for a heavy weight match, but these are just annoying and painful, and with a nearly-1kg tumour in my tummy, not welcome. I've tried a few of the traditional remedies (drinking out of the wrong side of the glass, drinking soda water, drinking with a spoon in the glass… I skipped the rectal massage idea I read about on the support group site) – but the only one I can get to work is to… Stop. I can't think of a more technical way to put it, I just need to really want to stop. It's a bit like that scene in The Matrix , about bending the spoon, or maybe the spoon isn't even there. Same with my hiccups, I just have to imagine they are not there. That involves concentrating really hard on my breathing and abdominal muscles and staring into space for literally 15 minutes. Quite difficult to do, particularly when your mind is racing and your heart is pounding at 120 bpm, but better than having spasms every 30 seconds. I think it's a major impact of cancer that no-one talks about – the Cancer Society should really put a notice on their website: \"Warning, Cancer: May Induce Hiccups\". That way people might take cancer more seriously. \nI've realised that much of my writing so far in these columns has been about strange body stuff. I guess it's pretty unavoidable that with a disease so impactful on my body, there will be some big changes to normal operations. I hope you are not all grossed out too much (like my 15-year-old son Batman: \"ew Dad, did you have to mention your testicles?\"), but I want to be open. Also, my wise friend Pete told me after the first one \"That which is most personal, is also most general\" – ie, the things that affect virtually everyone on the planet are the things we don't talk about much – things like money, health, emotions, anguish… rectal massages. So hopefully my few thoughts on my own personal plight will help others. Or at least lift the stigma felt everyday by people who hiccup. They should get a week, like other illnesses to raise awareness. National Hiccup Awareness week, where we all buy tiny glasses of water on the street and pin them to our shirts to fend off all the other people trying to get us to donate, and to be a little self-righteous when we arrive at work. On the Sunday before I went into chemotherapy on the Monday, before I started feeling too sick, I decided to have a few drinks at a bar and invite some of my friends. I briefly thought about milking it for all it was worth, and coming in on a wheelchair with a drip attached and everything, but you can add that to the rapidly-growing list of things Katherine has banned me doing. Friends from work, neighbours, old friends from university, and my previous lives – it was lovely. Even Jeremy turned up (you'll be relieved to hear that the tragedy of his diesel-filled car is behind him, although the scar on his wallet sounds like it's unlikely to ever heal if you listen to him). \nI was worried they would feel awkward, hanging around the sick cancer guy: a lot of them work in television and are incapable of spontaneous unscripted conversation, so I decided to create them a script they could rehearse with, to help break the ice. It did make it easier for them, made the whole scene less awkward and more natural, like an episode of Shortland Street . David Downs \nThe script for the hit new soap opera 'Chemo Street'. \nI would have loved to have stayed all night, surrounded by friends and forgetting about what the coming months would bring – sitting on the couches, with Joey and Chandler joking away, Monica and Ross arguing, Phoebe being her normal crazy… oh hang on, I think I might be remembering an episode of the sitcom Friends . Oops, must be because Katherine looks so much like Jennifer Aniston. \nAnyway, lovely as it was at my pre-chemo party, cancer reminded me that I was tired: my heart rate was way up, my breathing was short and sharp, and the threat of hiccups was imminent. \nAfter a couple of hours, I bid farewell and I headed home to get ready for Monday. David Downs \nThe actors rehearsing their lines before the big performance. \nAfter a night spent tossing and turning (and by that I mean restless, not that I made a salad and a chair leg), on Monday morning, 9am, back to the hospital for the first of six rounds of treatment. (In my old undies – despite what I thought were admirable hints to the manufacturer, backed up with some direct suggestions by readers, no three-pack of new Jockeys appeared on my doorstep last week). Ad Feedback \nEach round takes three weeks – essentially the pattern is that on day one (today) they fill your body with the actual chemotherapy drugs, and then over the subsequent weeks and days of each cycle, you take booster pills to help them do their job. It's rough on the body, particularly on the first week-to-10-days of the cycle, and then you recover a bit, and after the three weeks is up, you're ready to go through it again. It sounds like doing the Tour de France in the hilly bits, with just as many drugs involved. \nThey'd warned me that chemo-day is boring, as you have to sit for hours as the drugs go into your veins, so I've armed up with Kindle, iPad, phone, laptop, music and other electronic distractions. It wasn't necessary though - what catches my eye immediately is the comprehensive patient library previous inhabitants have generously left for us. David Downs \nThe reading matter in the clinic. Not sure if they want to give you something to do, or put you to sleep. \nLoads of old Women's Weekly magazines and books from every genre of light adult fiction from the past 40 years. Jilly Cooper, Catherine Cookson, Maeve Binchy, Jodi Picoult. Guess that's the sedative taken care of then. It's also a reminder that I am probably not the typical demographic of someone occupying this chair. So here you go, Hospital Pro-Tip #2: Unless you're keen on reading the exploits of a young woman coming of age in 19th century rural Britain, bring entertainment. \nGetting briefed on the drugs they are giving me is a bit like having a Doctor Seuss book read out loud. \"There'll be Rituximab and Vincristine, metachlopromide and cyclophosphamide, pills for your guts, injections for your heart – oh the places we'll go, let's make a start!\" \nOne of the drugs makes my urine turn bright red. Bright red mind you, like I've been mainlining Berocca. Just as well they told me, could be quite a nasty shock if I had just happened to notice in the loo. Trainspotting 3 . Another one essentially makes my 'fluids' poisonous to others for a few days, even my sweat. Don't be tempted to lick me, I'm like a cane toad now, without the potential to turn back into a prince. \nOne upside though is that if a mosquito bites me, they'll die. Sweet revenge for all the summer nights I've spent chasing them away from the BBQ. I assume the same would be true for a crocodile, but I don't bear the same sort of grudge so won't attempt to test it. \nIt's a long day alright, spent sitting waiting for the drugs to slowly drip into my system, but by the end of it, helped by the high spirits of the medical staff and a very plain ham sandwich, I'm done. Now that I am pumped more full of drugs than a 1970s rocker, I expect to have a few rough days ahead, so you might not hear from me for a while. I'll try to report back by the end of the week on the experience, now that I am a proper cancer patient, not some pretender. \nI did want to reiterate something I said in the first of these columns; I don't want my writing style or attitude to come across as flippant or disrespectful to others, particularly other cancer sufferers; everyone has their own journey through an illness like this, some of them much harder than mine. I am not trivialising it for others, I just want to tell the story the way I normally would. \nI believe there is a big difference between taking something seriously, and being solemn about it. I take having cancer seriously – really seriously – it's changing my life daily. But that doesn't mean I have to choose to be solemn. Many a true word is spoken in jest, as King Lear (I think) said. Mind you, he went mental at the end of the play, so not sure he is much of a role model. \nAnyway, all going well, let's talk again soon. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:07:33.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
