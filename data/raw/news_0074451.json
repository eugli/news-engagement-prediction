A spokesman for the RAF Benevolent Fund, which is responsible for looking after the memorial, said last night: ‘We are extremely disappointed and saddened that the Bomber Command Memorial has once again been subjected to vandalism. ‘Work is currently under way to remove the graffiti.’ Work is currently being carried out to remove the graffiti on the monument, which was unveiled in ‘The Memorial, which was unveiled in 2012, commemorates the 55,573 members of Bomber Command who died in the war, and as such, it is only befitting that the Memorial is kept in excellent condition.’ Yesterday’s incident was not the first time that the memorial has been vandalised. In May 2013, Andrew Patterson, of Westminster, spraypainted the word ‘Islam’ on the front of the memorial, as well as writing the same thing on the Animal In War memorial in Hyde Park. He was later detained under the mental health act. And a week after Patterson’s vandalism, it was attacked again, this time by Daniel Smith, of Salford, Greater Manchester. Smith wrote ‘Lee Rigby’s killers should hang’, in a reference to the fusilier who was murdered in May 2013, and ‘EDL’ in reference to the far-right English Defence League. He was jailed for 12 weeks for criminal damage.
