Right now was the best time, and it was the best offer we had,\" Divac said. \nThat better offer could have been from the Lakers, who have a host of young talent and are itching to turn around the fortunes of their franchise. \nThe Kings narrowed down their choice to either the Pelicans package or deal from the Lakers, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical . \nThe Lakers weren't interested in including rookie and No. 2 pick Brandon Ingram in exchange for Cousins, according to various reports, but could have still put together a competitive offer that would arguably be more attractive than what Sacramento ultimately accepted. \nWhat the final package from the Lakers included, and what the \"better\" offer Sacramento missed out on was, will likely remain a mystery. \nDid the Kings make a mistake by not getting more for Cousins, or were they stuck in a position to take whatever the best deal possible was?
