ITV 2 Emmerdale actress Michelle Hardwick (left) has split from her wife Rosie Nicholl after a year of marriage \nSpeaking to the Daily Star , she said: “Unfortunately Rosie and I did split last year but are still good friends. It was one of those things where we did drift apart. It’s just really sad and one of those things that happens. \n“We still have our dogs which we’ll share and nobody else was involved, it just happened and it was a mutual decision. I don’t know how else to explain it. I grew out of love and she became more of my best friend. It was like we were living as friends, not a married couple.” \nMichelle added: ” We’re still living together, just in separate rooms while the divorce goes through but it’s underway. It has been the hardest thing either of us has ever been through. \n“Coming to the decision to split was very difficult. But I believe it will be for the best in the long run.” PA:Press Association The soap star revealed the pair called time on their relationship last year because they had started to drift apart A year ago today this happened!
