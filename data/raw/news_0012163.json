His scintillating solo goal sent Francis Coquelin into a comical spin before he beat Laurent Koscielny not once, but twice.\nEden Hazard ran the show as Chelsea comfortably defeated Arsenal on Saturday\nHazard (left) doubled the hosts' lead in second half with stunning solo goal\nSUPER STAT Chelsea have won all nine Premier League games in which Hazard has scored this season.\nIt led Antonio Conte to leap into the crowd in celebration — ripping his trousers in the process — and had owner Roman Abramovich high-fiving pals in the posh seats.\nFor Arsene Wenger and Arsenal, it summed up an awful afternoon, one that condemned them to a chase for Champions League football rather than a race for the title.\nHazard is the most fouled player in the Premier League this season and, according to the 26-year-old, it is that which makes him world class. After Saturday, Arsenal know that all too well.\n‘It’s true,’ Hazard said. ‘When I get a lot of kicks, I really feel in the game. When people don’t touch me, that means I’m not doing well, I’m no good.\n‘I’m not saying I like to be kicked, but it’s good for me. I try to be this kind of player. Every time I get the ball I try to do something.\n‘In the past, for 20 or 30 minutes, I’ve not touched the ball. These days I try to get on the ball, try to have lots of touches, and play my football for 90 minutes.’\nThe Belgian (right) says the amount that he gets fouled is a sign of his greatness\nIt was men against boys at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea opened up a 12-point lead over Arsenal.\nWhile Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez sleepwalked with a single shot between them, Hazard tore Arsenal apart.\nMarcos Alonso and Cesc Fabregas also scored for Chelsea, but Hazard’s is the one that will be remembered after he ignored Arsenal’s attempts to rough him up.\nTwo years ago he led Chelsea to the title under Jose Mourinho and won Player of the Season. Now Hazard says he is not only back to his best, but better. ‘With the head, with experience, you improve,’ he said. ‘I am a better player, more complete, than I was.\n‘We are in better form as a team. Two years ago I was on fire but I can score more goals this season.\nHazard claims that he is now in the best moment of his footballing career\n‘I already have 10. Two years ago I finished with 14. We have a lot of games to play, so we will see.’\nAnd where does this rank in his greatest goals? ‘You, the journalists and the fans, have to choose,’ Hazard added. ‘But of this style of goal, it was one of the best.’\nConte concurred. The Chelsea boss won five Serie A titles as a Juventus player and three as a manager but recalls finishing second, too.\nConte said: ‘When you finish in second, it’s not good. People only remember who won.’\nAsked whether he remembers finishing runner-up more than winning, Conte said: ‘Yes. You must know my hunger in every game. The will to fight, to win. I was lucky to win a lot but I also lost.’\nAnother loss is not what Conte wants on his c.v. but, given the gap, it’s true what Wenger says: this is Chelsea’s to lose.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMailArsenal"], "published": "2017-02-06T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:30:46.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
