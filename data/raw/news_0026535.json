I’m on a safe wing. I only get out once a day.” \nYet he had cared little about his own “prisoner”, with written rules for Shannon including: “You must not go near the windows. \n\"You must not make any noise and bang your feet. You must not do anything without me being there.” Karen Matthews was also involved in the plot (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nDeluded Donovan, 48, even fantasises in the letters about getting away with his crime. \nHe wrote: “My solicitor said the police or CPS may drop the charges on me, because Karen did know I was looking after Shannon.” \nAnd he also tells Sarah: “My solicitor said he is making a bail application for me at a private bail hostel so no-one will know where I am living. But I will let you know about this first. \n“Please don’t get worried, I will not let anyone know about you and me. If I do get bail I would like to meet up with you and take you out for a meal and stroll in the park. I would like to take you out to ­Blackpool and Scarborough for a day. \n“I am really missing someone like you and I hope one day I would like to be with you. My family don’t want to know me. I am glad I have you now.” Karen Matthews at the time of the kidnap (Photo: PA) \nElsewhere he talks about education classes he is taking. \n“They do drawing, writing, maths and IT computer course. It’s something for me to do, but it’s not like the real thing on the outside,” he writes. \n“I have to go now but please remember I love you so much.” \nNot once in the letters does Donovan show any remorse for what happened to Shannon, who is now living a new life under a new name. \nWhile he kept watch over his frightened prisoner tethered to a loft beam, her brazen mother Matthews was weeping in front of TV cameras over her daughter’s “disappearance” on her way home from a swimming lesson at her primary school in Dewsbury, West Yorks. Michael Donovan was convicted of being involved in the kidnap plot (Photo: PA) \nShe and Donovan had plotted to fake the youngster’s kidnap in a bid to claim a £50,000 press reward when she was found. \nMatthews, 41, was also jailed for eight years, again serving only half the sentence. After his release from prison, Donovan was again arrested – this time for “poor behaviour”. \nHe was seen acting bizarrely while sitting on a bench in a Leeds market place. Had been spending six hours a day there and police picked him up after a request from parole officials. \nHe was returned to prison for a brief period. It is not known what happened to him after that. \nBBC drama The Moorside focuses on the council estate community’s search for missing Shannon, led by Matthew’s unsuspecting friend Julie Bushby, played by Sheridan Smith.
