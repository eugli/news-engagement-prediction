In Peele’s smart and sure hands, though, the film loops back around to become something probing and despondent, too. Get Out is witty and scary and fun. It’s also rattling with outrage, and, in its peculiar and prickly way, a bitter sadness. I haven’t seen a horror movie like it in quite some time. To be fair, I don’t see a lot of horror movies. It’s one of my biggest genre blind spots, perhaps even more so than my aversion to most animated films. So when I say that Get Out is scary, bear in mind that my threshold for scariness is low. (I recently had to cover my eyes during a scene in The Great Wall , for crying out loud.) That said, Get Out is so artful in the way it builds its suspense, its surreality, that I’d imagine even a die-hard horror aficionado will find at least something chilling about the film. It’s just so cleverly done; Peele shows remarkably confident vision for a first-time feature director. Granted, Peele was the co-creator and co-star of the lauded five-season sketch comedy series Key & Peele , so he knows his way around building a bit. But there are more complex mechanics at work in Get Out , a serious fear mixing intoxicatingly with high-arch satire. Get Out is about race—explicitly, implicitly, textually, subtextually. It’s a nasty, and necessary, perversion of racism panaceas like Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner? , which reassure white audiences about how they’d surely behave if such an anomaly—a black person in our home??—were to happen in their lives. One of the first lines of dialogue in the film is our hero, Chris (the wonderful Daniel Kaluuya ), asking his white girlfriend, Rose (a perfectly, witheringly cast Allison Williams ), “Do they know?” Meaning, do Rose’s parents know that her boyfriend, whom she’s bringing home for the weekend for the first time, is black? She balks at the question, uncomfortable with the implication that her parents might have a problem with it, and indeed the deeper implication that all white parents might have a problem with it. But Chris remains uncertain, his experience telling him that his mere presence in white spaces can change the climate—immediately contextualizing him as an outsider, an oppositional entity. Rose is sweet and cute, though, and Chris wants to—has to, maybe—assume the best of her family. So he goes. The film’s uneasy beginnings quickly crescendo into psychological, and eventually physical, terror. All the while, Peele has a good time vacillating between deadly seriousness and a wry tweaking of genre conventions. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener play Rose’s parents, friendly and liberal-seeming intellectuals whose casual openness to Chris nonetheless has an off, manic quality about it. (It doesn’t help that Whitford says “thang” to Chris and eagerly asserts his Obama-loving bona fides.) The minute we find out that Keener’s character is a hypnotherapist, we know that this already freighted weekend is not going to go well for Chris. Throughout, Kaluuya does a masterful, telling piece of acting, as Chris balances suspicion with a trained, peacekeeping politeness and easygoingness—a delicate dance that many black men in America are forced to learn. Peele’s film, dark and harrowing as it may be, is filled with sympathy and ache for Chris, and for others, who are made to navigate a world rigged against them and are then blamed for setting off the booby traps. Get Out is a push back against that, a little revenge, a bit of bloody justice. This is not a film that seeks to soothe racial tensions—because it doesn’t have to. That is not its, nor Chris’s, responsibility. Get Out eschews any placating as Peele offers up both low-horror comedy and high-horror artiness. Working with cinematographer Toby Oliver, Peele creates images that are beautiful and terrifying, an elegance possessed by menace. His music choices, whether a Childish Gambino slow jam or one of Michael Abels’s haunting choral pieces, are spot-on, aptly setting a mood of winking dread. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Lakeith Stanfield as a mannered weirdo party guest, Betty Gabriel as a frightfully accommodating housemaid, and Lil Rel Howery as a caustic best-friend character who seems zapped in from another movie, but whose incongruity in the picture works as perfect counterbalance to all the gothic horror surrounding him. The white people in the cast all know their place, allowing themselves (and the white people in the audience) to be skewered without redemption. Peele has made a movie about the black experience in white America that does not appease or accommodate, that enjoys itself while still speaking to a troubling and pervasive truth. In many ways it’s a film aimed at catharsis, for a community that has long been fighting to assert that their very lives matter, and who now face even greater animus from the highest offices in the land—and, of course, very often from everyday life. Peele’s film is trenchant and riotous, bitter and bleak. And it’s all those things in an artful, never pretentious manner. (Well, O.K., maybe there are a few moments of pretension. But that’s part of the fun!) Get Out does not offer any institutional hope in the end. But it does provide a place for anger, vengeance, and a healthy amount of gallows humor. That’s a valuable place—one black cinema has long been denied, at least in the studio system. In that sense, Peele’s film feels like a small piece of painful progress.
