Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said in a statement . “States and local communities are best positioned to shape curricula that meet the needs of their students. Schools should be accountable. Parents have the right to choose the most appropriate educational opportunity for their children, including homeschool, public school, or private school.\"\nThe action came the same day the Senate narrowly approved Betsy DeVos as education secretary. Vice President Mike Pence had to break a 50-50 tie for the approval, the first time a vice president has had to intervene on a Cabinet nominee.\nMassie’s bill is a single page and is co-sponsored by Republican Reps. Justin Amash of Michigan, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Jason Chaffetz of Utah, Matt Gaetz of Florida, Jody Hice of Georgia, Walter Jones of North Carolina and Raul Labrador of Idaho.\nThe current Department of Education, which was established in 1979, long has been in Republicans’ sights.\nAn earlier version was created in 1867 but then demoted from department to office in 1868. In 1953 it regained Cabinet-level status as part of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and was made a separate department by former President Jimmy Carter in 1979.\nFormer President Ronald Reagan proposed dismantling it in 1981 along with the Department of Energy.\n“Education is the principal responsibility of local school systems, teachers, parents, citizen boards and state governments,” Reagan said. “By eliminating the Department of Education less than two years after it was created, we cannot only reduce the budget but ensure that local needs and preferences, rather than the wishes of Washington, determine the education of our children.”\nThe department “establishes policy for, administers and coordinates most federal assistance to education … assists the president in executing his education policies for the nation and in implementing laws enacted by Congress … to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.”\nOpponents of DeVos’ nomination argued she would dismantle public education although she pledged during her confirmation hearing not to do so. Democrats painted her as unqualified for the job because she was unfamiliar with basic policy issues, is an advocate of school vouchers and reportedly has little familiarity with public education.\nRelated Articles \nRichard Spencer Slams DeVos, 'Black Ghetto' School Choice At Center of DeVos Confirmation Debate", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:16:18.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
