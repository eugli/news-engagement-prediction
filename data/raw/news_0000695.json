Back in 2007, Apple dropped the word “Computer” from its name as it positioned its brand for the wider range of consumer electronics it would end up producing. \nThe rest is history. \nTesla is in a similar situation with its expansion into new industries. Back in June, the company completed the purchase of SolarCity , one of the largest solar energy companies in the world. This transformed Tesla from an electric car manufacturer to a vertically integrated energy company. \nMusk then unveiled the aptly named Solar Roof, a roof made of solar tiles that turns sunlight into electricity for immediate use or storage in the company’s beautiful Powerwall battery . \nAll of these ventures show Tesla is up to much more than just automobiles, and the new name is simply a reintroduction of the company to the much larger ecosystem it hopes to spark back to life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:13:15.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
