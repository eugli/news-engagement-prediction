Moscow denies that.\nMichael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the European security body OSCE's mission to Ukraine, told Al Jazeera that the new US administration was not being clear about how it would deal with the rising tensions.\n\"In the previous administration, Russians were really attacked for their activities in eastern Ukraine but the Trump administration is really sending mixed signals,\" he said.\n\"The big fear is that Trump may withdraw support for the sanctions against Russia and that could turn a chain reaction where Greece, Italy and other EU members may also withdraw support.\"\nThe NATO factor Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko is planning a referendum on whether Ukraine should join the NATO alliance given polls that show 54 percent of Ukrainians now favour such a move, Germany's Funke Mediengruppe newspaper chain reported on Thursday.\n\"Four years ago, only 16 percent (of the Ukrainian people) favoured Ukraine's entry into NATO. Now it's 54 percent,\" the media group quoted Poroshenko as saying in an interview.\nREAD MORE: Ukraine files case against Russia at UN's top court \n\"As president, I am guided by the views of my people, and I will hold a referendum on the issue of NATO membership.\"\nHe vowed to \"do all I can to achieve membership in the transatlantic alliance\" if the people voted in favour.\nNATO and Ukraine have had a close relationship since the early 1990s, and their ties are one of the \"most substantial\" of NATO's partnerships, according to the alliance's website.\nHowever, any move by NATO to admit Ukraine would spark tensions with Russia, which says NATO already violated earlier promises by admitting Poland and other eastern European countries in the 1990s.\nPoroshenko also predicted it would not take long until Ukraine fulfilled the entry criteria to join the European Union.\nHe said Kiev had reduced its budget deficit and inflation, and had taken important steps to reduce corruption.\nThe EU last year spelled out limits to a landmark cooperation agreement with Ukraine to address Dutch concerns, but said the deal did not make Ukraine a candidate for EU membership.\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agencies \nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T10:47:31.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
