Alamy A man walked out of a job interview at a TGI Friday’s restaurant in Derby after he claims he was asked “disgusting and sick” questions \nThe 18-year-old from Chellaston told the Derby Telegraph he was “absolutely gob-smacked”. \nHe added: “I thought it was disgusting, sick and pathetic. I left the interview at that point.” \nA spokesman for TGI apologised for what happened and said a member of staff had been suspended. \nThey added: “The questions posed during the interview with the candidate are absolutely not part of TGI Friday’s interview process and we were very disappointed to learn of this incident. \n“Immediate action was taken, with the person involved suspended. \n“We have apologised to the candidate for the experience and offered them the opportunity to re-interview with us, which we hope they will take up.” RELATED STORIES Theresa May gets another poll boost while Jeremy Corbyn is somehow even less popular SHORT CIRCUITED Killer robots WILL be regulated but you won't get a payout if they nick your job, say Euro MPs THE SUN SAYS Brits are suffering from immigrants taking their jobs for half the price QUAFF LIKE AN EGYPTIAN Don't forget the Egyptians built the Pyramids on beer & they did a top job, say the Thinking Drinkers Think your job stinks?
