'Now the rocks have been put in place to stop us pitching tents, and to make sure we are as uncomfortable as possible. 'The site is also next door to an official refugee welcome centre that has only 400 beds for men arriving in Paris. There is a long queue of people trying to get in every morning, but hundreds are turned away and they have no other option but to sleep rough. 'It is an impossible situation,' said another UK-bound migrant who asked to be identified as Mohamed. 'We can't get into the centre, and are brutalised when we try to sleep nearby. All they want is for us to go away. The rocks are disgusting and inhuman.' Paris authorities claim the rocks have been installed as a health and safety measure Parisian authorities claimed the migrants were risking their lives sleeping near a busy road There have been several previous attempts to move out unofficial camps from the area The Eurostar service to St Pancras International stops at Gare Du Nord, pictured There has been a massive influx of refugees into Paris since the so-called \"Jungle\" refugee camp in Calais was razed last October. Some 8,000 men, women and children were dispersed to other parts of France, in an attempt to try and stop them getting into Britain illegally. Many refused to be registered, however, preferring to stay out of the French system so as to improve their chances of starting new lives in the UK. A spokesman for the Paris city council insisted that the rocks had simply been moved from a pavement nearby, and were 'not an anti-migrant device'. Instead it was a 'security issue', because people were putting themselves at risk by sleeping close to trains and a busy road. There are frequent rows in the UK when 'anti-homeless spikes' are installed to prevent people sleeping rough. Last month residents in Manchester city centre covered an area with pillows and cushions after metal spikes were installed on a sheltered area outside a private building. Manchester city council condemned the 'demeaning' measures and vowed to meet the owners of the building to try get them removed.
