Article continues below \nFans though it was strange and RAW general manager Mick Foley joined them in their criticisms as he took to Twitter to question how much instant replay was necessary when Bryan would swoop in to make it irrelevant. \nOn Talking Smack, The American Dragon fired back at the living legend and took aim at the weaknesses of Raw’s other programming when compared with his show.
