The Standard Coroner to review baffling case of missing mum Katherine Ackling-Bryen Danielle Jarvis, Mt Druitt-St Marys Standard February 19, 2017 9:36am Katherine Ackling-Bryen still missing Tears and anguish over mystery of missing mum Concern for missing mum of two young girls\nThe baffling disappearance of Oxley Park mum Katherine Ackling-Bryen has been forwarded to the NSW Coroner.\nDespite repeated appeals from the family, police letterbox drops and extensive media coverage, there has been no sightings or any more information on the missing mother of two since February 19 last year.\nThe NSW Coroner is reviewing the case in April to decide whether they will hold an inquest into the disappearance.\nToday marks a year since the 37-year-old mother of two was reported missing.\nmedia_camera Missing mum Katherine Ackling-Bryen. CCTV security footage still of when she was last seen at St Marys Village shopping Centre.\nMrs Ackling-Bryen dropped something off to her daughters at school on the Friday morning.\nShe then stopped in at St Marys Village Shopping where she was captured on CCTV leaving the centre towards Queen St at 12.17pm. She has not been seen or heard from since.\nHer husband Michael Bryen reported her missing at 3.30pm that day when she failed to pick up her daughters, Emma and Caitlin, from school that afternoon.\nMr Bryen said it was extremely out of character for his wife to not pick up the girls.\nmedia_camera St Marys LAC crime manager Det Insp Barry Vincent holding leaflets alerting the community to missing Mrs Ackling-Bryen. media_camera Mrs Ackling-Bryen was described as a devoted mum. Picture: Supplied.\nAt the time of her disappearance, St Marys crime manager Barry Vincent said police believed she returned to their home on the Great Western Highway after her trip to the shopping centre.\n“We believe she did make it home as the items she purchased from Target were inside her home still in the shopping bags,” Detective Inspector Vincent said.\nPolice also found her purse and mobile phone in her locked home. Her keys were never located.\nDet-Insp Vincent said detectives found no evidence to suggest she fell victim to foul play.", "external_links": ["http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ee2fe0c234c1e71ef01492aa52e816ca?width=316", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/9bf70e9ee023b4d8707c17d5212e728f?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storyheader/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/19d3b0a2e1638b09936dcf2d3434a281?domain=newsapi.com.au", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c795d97dec9f8288d27232f50aac63db?width=316", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fthe-standard%2Fnews-story%2F9bf70e9ee023b4d8707c17d5212e728f", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/9bf70e9ee023b4d8707c17d5212e728f?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/08b76b4e3aaccc0b64e6ed6f4437bb7e?width=1024", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fthe-standard%2Fnews-story%2F9bf70e9ee023b4d8707c17d5212e728f&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fthe-standard%2Fnews-story%2F9bf70e9ee023b4d8707c17d5212e728f", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Mum%20still%20missing%20a%20year%20on&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fthe-standard%2Fnews-story%2F9bf70e9ee023b4d8707c17d5212e728f", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8a26be385a543d113b786d52005120ab?width=316", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/the-standard", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/9bf70e9ee023b4d8707c17d5212e728f?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storymeta/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js"], "published": "2017-02-18T14:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T08:57:17.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
