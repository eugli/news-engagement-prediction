By Hadas Gold 02/01/17 06:07 PM EST \nIndpendent Journal Review scored what many outlets would consider a major scoop, beating other media by at least two hours with the news that President Donald Trump would choose Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. | Getty Print \nDuring last year’s presidential campaign, the upstart, millennial-focused conservative web site Independent Journal Review was best known for videos of Ted Cruz cooking bacon on a machine gun and candidates pardoning Turkeys. \nOn Tuesday, it scored what many outlets would consider a major scoop , beating other media by at least two hours with the news that President Donald Trump would choose Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court – but no one seemed to notice. Story Continued Below \nNormally, such a scoop – initially sourced to two high-ranking administration sources – would ricochet across the media spectrum, with cable news running banners and rival websites crediting IJR. \nBut few other media trusted IJR enough to go with the report. Other outlets reported that Trump had invited two finalists, Gorsuch and Judge Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, to Washington for what seemed like an “Apprentice”-type announcement of the winner. At one point, CNN aired footage of Hardiman at a gas station, supposedly on his way to Washington. \nNow, the media world’s disregard of IJR and other lesser-known websites may be starting to change – especially given the widespread expectation that Trump’s administration would give media from outside the mainstream, especially from the right, the kind of access that previously was given only to the largest outlets. \nBut skeptics remain. By Hadas Gold \nReporters and editors from other news organizations noted in background conversations that IJR isn’t known for news scoops and that other organizations couldn’t corroborate the report. Also largely unknown to other media was the staffer who wrote the piece, Benny Johnson, the site’s creative director who had previously been at National Review and BuzzFeed. In 2014, Johnson was fired from BuzzFeed for multiple instances of plagiarism . \nBut Johnson touted the Gorsuch scoop as a sign that his and his web site’s time has come. He was at the White House the day he broke the story, getting the last question in the briefing. \n\"I would cite two things [as to why weren’t cited]. One, is we’re new. I get that. It’s a three-year-old company and life comes at you fast. I’ve seen this before at young digital companies I’ve worked for,” Johnson said. \"Second, you’re dealing with the Trump White House and I can’t actually blame people for not wanting to run with such big scoop, being so weary when it’s Donald Trump and the administration is complicit in playing the game of 'will they, won’t they, bachelorette style, give me a rose, who is in the envelope.’ ” \nNonetheless, Johnson said he was frustrated that some outlets, including The Washington Post and Bloomberg, published stories about how Trump had kept the pick secret until the 8 p.m. unveiling using back roads and suburban houses to hide Gorsuch’s presence in the capital. \n“The bee in my bonnet is that there has been an open and complicit rewriting in history, this rewriting of history that Trump kept it a secret – ‘it’s crazy, how did he do it,’ ” Johnson said. “No, that’s actually not true. It was reported and sourced by four sources within the administration by 5 p.m. So it’s just not the correct narrative. That’s what’s been frustrating.” \nThe three-year-old IJR has grown rapidly, even co-sponsoring a Republican primary debate last year. While the site has full-time reporters, it’s better known for posting lighthearted videos during the campaign, including the one of Cruz cooking bacon on a machine gun, other candidates practicing their turkey pardons with live turkeys and Sen. Marco Rubio throwing a football and hitting various Washington-types. And while it’s had its growing pains -- around a dozen top staffers and reporters have decamped in recent months -- the site sees its Supreme Court exclusive as proof that it can play in the same league. \nIn the same way that Trump has shaken up the political establishment, he may be attempting to shake up the media hierarchy. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has been taking questions from less traditional outlets in the briefing room and has brought in “Skype seats” for outlets from around the country including one that had endorsed Trump. By Louis Nelson \nJohnson said he saw similar situations play out when he worked at BuzzFeed, where he said he’d watch editor-in-chief Ben Smith \"have to knife fight for respect” on scoops \"because they were so new on the scene four years ago and they weren’t known for hard journalism.” \n\"I think that speaks to the industry itself, it’s flexing into something that isn’t 1s and 0s it’s in’t A to B,” Johnson said. \"You can break hard news and still have creative entertaining content on the same platform.\" \nSome editors said they just didn’t see the report, with one area editor noting that popular aggregation sites like the DrudgeReport didn’t pick it up either. The only other website that reported the Gorsuch appointment before 8 p.m., while linking to the Independent Journal Review report, was National Review. It posted its report roughly two hours after IJR put up its story. \nAlex Skatell, one of IJR’s founders and its CEO, rejected the idea that other outlets didn’t cite the report because they didn’t see it, noting that traffic on the original post hit nearly 500,000 people before the announcement. \n\"Nearly 500,000 people had read the article by 8 p.m., including right after 3 p.m. sending out a press release to every reporter in D.C,” Skatell said. “It was not a secret. I think everyone in DC was aware of it. In this news environment, on a scoop this big, I think news organizations were right to be cautious. I think where we were frustrated was when stories were being written with the premise of no one having the information when 500,000 people had already viewed our article.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T13:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:31:38.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
