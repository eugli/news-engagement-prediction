The secrecy lent to speculation that the president could have changed his mind at the last minute in a bid for the ratings-savvy former Apprentice host to build suspense around the event. \nTrump will also be streaming the address via Facebook Live, a move announced by the White House earlier on Tuesday with a tagline to tune in that rings truer to a promo for a reality show: \"You won't want to miss it!\" \nTrump also teased the announcement from his personal Twitter account on Monday. \nHis choice fills the seat left vacant by Antonin Scalia, who died February 2016. \nWatch Trump's live announcement below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:57:20.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
