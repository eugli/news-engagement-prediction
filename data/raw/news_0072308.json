They got their machine out on the day. We did our best, we fell short this time but in the future it will happen for Ukip. Ukip's time will come'. He added: 'There's a lot more to come from us. We are not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere. This seat was, what, number 72 on our hit list'. The new Ukip leader's campaign was dogged by controversy from the beginning but he said the 'whole Hillsborough thing' had not been an issue on the doorstep The new Ukip leader's campaign was dogged by controversy from the beginning after admitting he did not live at the address listed as his home on by-election nomination papers. Days later he was then forced to apologise for a false claim on his website that he lost 'close friends' in the Hillsborough disaster. Today some critics have called on him to resign and experts have also claimed that if he had been forced into third place behind the Tories he would have been forced out by the party's hierarchy.

'We have said with one voice that hatred and bigotry are not welcome here. This is a proud city and we stand together'. Since being elected as Nigel Farageâ€™s replacement in November, Mr Nuttall has been dogged by claims that he has not always told the truth. Last year, it emerged that he had claimed to have been a professional football player on election leaflets, having only played for Tranmere Rovers youth team. He also faced embarrassment over a LinkedIn page that claimed he had a PhD from Liverpool Hope University, despite not completing the course Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:17:25.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
