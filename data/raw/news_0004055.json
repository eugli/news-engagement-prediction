Mint employee accused of smuggling gold in his rectum Story continues below \nHe worked at the mint from 2008 until March 2015. \nLawrence aroused suspicion in a bank employee in February 2015 after he asked to cash two cheques worth $15,200 from Ottawa Gold Buyers. Lawrence told the teller he had sold “gold nuggets” when she asked what the money was for, said court records. \nThe bank tipped off police, who then put Lawrence under surveillance. \nREAD MORE: Royal Canadian Mint employee accused of using rectum to smuggle $180,000 in gold \nLawrence set off the metal detector more often than any other mint employee without metal implants, Doody said in his ruling. But follow-up searches with hand wands never discovered the smuggled gold hidden in his body cavity. \nPolice eventually seized a gold puck that Lawrence had sold and found four more in his safety deposit box. \nVaseline and latex gloves were later found in Lawrence’s locker, which Doody said “could have been used to facilitate insertion of gold items inside his rectum.” \nDoody ruled Lawrence had stolen 22 gold pucks from the mint worth $165,451.14.
