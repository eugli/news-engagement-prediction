Meachem began serving that sentence Monday. \nMeachem could be released earlier if he pays his ex-wife, Andrea Rhodes, $100,000, but barring that, he will remain in jail until March 15, according to court documents obtained by the New Orleans Times-Picayune . \nMeachem, who made more than $20 million during his eight-year career, and Rhodes divorced in November 2015, according to court records. He was ordered to pay $20,000 a month in spousal and child support for the coupleâ€™s two children, but attorneys for Rhodes asked the court last year to hold Meachem in contempt for failing to make payments. \nThe 32-year-old former wideout played with the Saints for six of his seven years in the NFL, spending 2012 with the Chargers. A first-round pick in 2007, Meachem helped the Saints win the Super Bowl in 2009. He played his final year in the league in 2014, finishing with 178 catches for 2,914 yards and 29 total touchdowns. 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:52:04.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
