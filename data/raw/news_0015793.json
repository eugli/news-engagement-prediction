(Photo: Michael Chow/The Republic) \nMany Arizonans were surprised to see Arizona State University's advertisement during the Super Bowl, a well-produced story about one student who is helping to solve the global clean-water crisis. \nThe ad featured ASU engineering and education doctoral student Mark Huerta. He is co-founder and CEO of the non-profit 33 Buckets , which helps communities in underdeveloped countries gain access to clean drinking water. \n\"To see those kids drink clean water for the first time, it’s the most rewarding feeling you can ever have,\" Huerta said in the ad. \"I went to ASU because I wanted to change the world. The thing I never would have expected was how the world would have changed me.\" \nIt only ran locally on Fox 10, according to ASU, and the cost of the ad time charged the university was $75,000. \n\"As we look for innovative ways to share what’s going on at ASU, we are mindful of budgets and act as efficiently as we can. The ability to reach a Super Bowl-sized audience here in the Phoenix area at a heavily-discounted price was an example of ASU using resources carefully and to the maximum effect,\" the university said in a statement.
