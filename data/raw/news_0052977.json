'Still, unless we heed the message from people who think that we have let them down, a book like this can become the thinking person's justification for voting One Nation.' The former prime minister said it was 'easy to see why' the major parties lost votes in last year's election. 'Our challenge is to be worth voting for,' Mr Abbott said. Tony Abbott has also told Andrew Bolt his successor needed to move into Kirribilli House Pauline Hanson flying high: Tony Abbott said disillusioned Liberal voters were considering One Nation Mr Abbott later told conservative columnist Andrew Bolt the government was losing its way. 'Plainly there are lots of people who are concerned about our direction and plainly the risk is we will drift to defeat if we don't lift our game,' Mr Abbott told Sky News on Thursday night. 'I have a duty to try and ensure that our party and our government stays on the right track and plainly there are some issues right now and it's incumbent upon me to raise these issues, to exercise if you like the freedom of the backbench.' Mr Abbott's intervention is politically destabilising to Mr Turnbull, who governs with a bare one-seat majority. The comments are reminiscent of former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd destabilising Julia Gillard in the years after she took his job in June 2010. Five years ago this week, Mr Rudd quit as foreign minister during a dramatic 1.30am media conference, in Washington DC, to announce he didn't have the confidence of Ms Gillard. Tony Abbott (pictured as prime minister in 2013) said there was despair about Turnbull Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu with his wife Sara and Mr Turnbull and his wife Lucy during a visit to the Moriah War Memorial College in Sydney, Thursday Now Mr Abbott, who like Mr Rudd was knifed as PM during his first term, said politics shouldn't be a clash of egos. 'It won't be easy but it must be possible or our country is doomed to a Shorten government that will make a bad situation immeasurably worse,' Mr Abbott told the book launch on Thursday night. 'In or out of government, political parties need a purpose. Our politics can't be just a contest of toxic egos or someone's vanity project.' During his speech at the book launch, Mr Abbott also recommended the government consider taking senate reform to the next election. 'The Senate sabotage of the 2014 budget was blamed on poor salesmanship, but my successor's difficulties with far less sweeping measures show that the problem is less the salesman than the system.' On The Bolt Report, Mr Abbott said Mr Turnbull needed to live at Kirribilli House, on Sydney Harbour, instead of having taxpayer foot a hefty security bill to live at his mansion across the water at Point Piper, in the eastern suburbs. Mr Turnbull is pictured shaking hands with former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says she does not agree with Mr Abbott's assessment that the government risks a 'drift to defeat' if it fails to lift its performance. Speaking to reporters in London on Thursday Ms Bishop said she had not seen Mr Abbott's 'so-called manifesto' to make the next election winnable for a coalition government. She said the Liberal Party welcomed policy initiatives from ministers and backbenchers and as a former party leader Mr Abbott would have ideas. But she said she rejected Mr Abbott's 'drift to defeat' view. 'I don't accept that characterisation at all.' Ms Bishop said the Turnbull government had been pursuing policies that were in the interests of the Australian people to grow the economy, create jobs and focus on national security. Liberal Party what Kevin Rudd did to the Labor Party she said she didn't see it that way. 'The government is working very well in Canberra. The cabinet is very united behind Malcolm Turnbull,' Christoper Pyne said She also rejected a suggestion in an Andrew Bolt interview with Mr Abbott on Sky News that she was not 'conservative, plain-speaking and loyal'. Ms Bishop said she had been elected by the party to be deputy leader and she owed her loyalty to the party room. 'If there's a characterisation about being conservative and plain speaking and loyal I believe I fill that characterisation.' On the West Australian election Ms Bishop said she expected the Liberal Party to win in its own right without One Nation support as Premier Colin Barnett was the only leader with a plan for the future prosperity of the state. On Friday morning, Defence Minister Christopher Pyne said the government was 'getting on with the job' and would not be distracted by the speculation. 'The government is working very well in Canberra. The cabinet is very united behind Malcolm Turnbull,' Mr Pyne told Nine Network's Today Show. He branded Mr Abbott's suggestion the federal government curtail immigration as 'catastrophic'. Mr Pyne noted the former prime minister was now a backbencher, although he was free to state his views.
