The former UFC middleweight champion, who always played DMX’s “Ain't No Sunshine” during his entrances, announced Friday that he will walk with a different soundtrack at UFC 208 on Saturday night when he faces Derek Brunson . Instead of the DMX classic, Silva will walk out to his son’s Kalyl Silva’s original song “Doom.” Kalyl’s single can be downloaded on iTunes . Silva has mentioned in the past that he wanted to change his walkout song, but, according to the Brazilian, UFC president Dana White insisted that he continued with the same song. “The Spider” will step inside the Octagon for the 22th time Saturday night, and looks to earn his first win in more than four years.
