Essential viewing: Casablanca (1942, directed by Michael Curtiz) \nThere is no point in expounding on the near perfection of Casablanca . As Umberto Eco said, it is \"not one movie, it is movies .\" Roger Ebert said that \"When asked what is the greatest film of all time, I say Citizen Kane . When asked what is the movie you like the best, I say Casablanca .\" \nAnd what's not to like? The luminous black-and-white cinematography that makes almost every frame worthy of an art gallery. Those perfect performances by Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains. That song, sung by Dooley Wilson. The zippy screenplay, full of lines that have escaped into the everyday chatter of people who might not even know just what they are quoting. (\"I am shocked—shocked!\" \"Here's looking at you, kid.\" And \"Play it again, Sam,\" which was never actually said in the movie, of course.) \nSome of us could get lost in that dialogue for hours. Well, at least for an hour and 42 minutes, once or twice a year, since we were teenagers. But if the true test of a classic is a work that has something fresh to say to each generation that encounters it, it's worth asking how this 1942 release holds up 75 years later. \nA new book, We'll Always Have Casablanca , by Noah Isenberg (W.W. Norton, $27.95) is a helpful starting point. Isenberg offers a brisk overview of the film's creation, addresses a few myths and attempts to explain how the magic happened. \nIt really seems like a miracle that it did. Casablanca was a product of a studio system that treated movies more as assembly-line products than works of art, and for the uninitiated, it might be shocking to learn how many terrible decisions were almost made. (Aljean Harmetz's 1992 book Round Up the Usual Suspects , cited by Isenberg, is a good source for details about the film's production history.) \nIsenberg dismisses as studio propaganda the legend that the original stars were supposed to be Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. But it's true that producer Hal B. Wallis considered dubbing over Wilson's voice, and that composer Max Steiner considered As Time Goes By to be \"the lousiest song.\" (Isenberg considers it a rumor that plans to reshoot scenes containing the song were felled only because Bergman had cut her hair for her next project.) A poster for Casablanca. DMN file \nThe script may be the one great work of art ever accomplished by a committee, although over the years, exactly who deserves credit for what has gotten blurry. Isenberg gives the contributions of the original playwrights Murray Burnett and Joan Alison their due; Wallis later dismissed their Everybody Comes to Rick's as an obscure work by unknowns, but he also paid $20,000 for the rights, a Hollywood record for an unproduced play. Screenwriters Julius and Philip Epstein were masters of dialogue; Howard Koch added political heft. There were others — it's possible that Bogie himself contributed \"Here's looking at you, kid,\" and \"Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.\" \nI find one cringe-worthy moment in the movie, Ilsa's reference to piano player Sam as a \"boy\" soon after she first walks into Rick's saloon. That's not the only taint of racism in the film's legacy; Isenberg points out that Wilson's pay of $3,500 was less than some of the other white supporting players; Sydney Greenstreet (Signor Ferrari) made $7,500. \nBut for 1942, Casablanca was forward-looking. The black-owned New York Amsterdam declared that the film was one \"every colored person should make it his business to see since no picture has given as much sympathetic treatment and prominence to a Negro character as occurs in this story .... There's not the slightest semblance to the objectionable Uncle Tomming that characterizes most of the Hollywood output.\" \nAnd for 2017, the there's a very modern story at the film's core. And it's not the one about a woman torn between two lovers. 'Casablanca's' politics \nCasablanca is a movie about refugees. It has its roots in a European trip Burnett made in 1938. He ended up needing a visa to travel in Vienna, where the Nazis had come to power, to help Jewish relatives. It was there that he learned of the refugee trail that led from Marseilles to Morocco to Lisbon to America. The same one fans know from the movie's opening scenes. We'll Always Have Casablanca , by Noah Isenberg \nIt's a part of the world familiar to anyone following today's news. The opening's stock footage might be of people fleeing Germans, but it's not a great leap to imagine today's rivers of Syrians in similar situations. \nCasablanca is also a movie made possible by immigrants. \"Nearly all of the some seventy-five actors and actresses cast in Casablanca were immigrants,\" Isenberg writes. \"Among the fourteen who earned a screen credit, only three were born in the United States: Humphrey Bogart, Dooley Wilson [a native of Tyler] and Joy Page, Jack Warner's stepdaughter, who plays the Bulgarian refugee Annina Brandel.\" Rains was from London. Paul Henreid (Victor Laszlo) was from Trieste, in what is now Italy. Peter Lorre (Ugarte) was born in what is now Slovakia. Conrad Veidt (Major Strasser) had been a star in Germany. On the set, many of the actors and crew members spoke German between takes. \nOne American-born bit actor recalled the streams of tears flowing from the eyes of his fellow actors during the film's most stirring moment, the singing of \"La Marseillaise\" by a roomful of people who have had their way of life stripped from them by fascists. \"I suddenly realized,\" he said, \"That they were all real refugees.\" A poster for Casablanca. DMN file \nThey are singing in French, but their eyes are on America. Rick, the ultimate American, seemingly just wants to go about his business: \"I stick my neck out for nobody.\" But we of course know that he, and Ilsa, come to realize that — spoiler alert — their problems don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. And they do the right thing. \nThat the film serves as a call to action for anyone who cares about democracy is part of its appeal across the decades and across political lines. Perhaps the Epsteins were particularly primed for the mission; when they dove into the script, they were fresh from having served with Frank Capra on the classic \"Why We Fight\" series. Perhaps it was also the passion of Koch, who later was subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee, blacklisted and forced into exile in England. \nSo is Casablanca relevant? Isenberg quotes Harmetz: \"There are better movies than Casablanca, but no other movie better demonstrates America's mythological vision of itself — tough on the outside and moral within, capable of sacrifice and romance without sacrificing the individualism that conquered a continent. ... No other movie has so reflected both the moment when it was made — the early days of World War II — and the psychological needs of audiences decades later.\" Dooley Wilson and Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca.
