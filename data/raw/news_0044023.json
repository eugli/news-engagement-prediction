His cancer, unless there is a miracle, will not be cured,” Larocque said. “We are looking at prolonging our time with him.”\nAir Canada’s snub-nosed breeds travel policy applies to a variety of dogs, including Boston terriers, chow chows, bulldogs and pugs.\nLarocque wants the company to re-analyze the ban and take pets on a case-by-case basis, similar to WestJet.\n“If they’re going to have a policy on snub nosed dogs, let it be based on actual research, actual advice from a vet,” she said.\nThe B.C. woman says she’s desperate to bring her sick dog home and the policy prevents it from happening sooner.\n“To be alone for an extra 72 hours in a facility, hundreds and hundreds of kilometres away from us , that’s not where he needs to be when he’s as sick as he is,” Larocque said.\nPhotos Cheech can’t fly with Air Canada because of its policy that bans snub-nose breeds from flying.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:53:00.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
