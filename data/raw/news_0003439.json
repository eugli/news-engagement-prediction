I love that. Toure was on the score sheet against West Ham \n“I like to play with guys like him. At the end it becomes a profession and you have to do that, but he is like an amateur in those terms. \n“He is really fit, the weight is perfect and the situation with Fernandinho and losing a lot of players meant he was so important for his personality and he helps us with his build-up and so on.” \nToure was exiled from City’s first team after his controversial agent Dmitry Seluk publicly criticised Guardiola. \nBut the midfielder’s subsequent apology saw him recalled for November’s 2-1 win against Crystal Palace, with Toure scoring both goals. \nDespite interest from China, Toure has opted to see out his contract at City, before assessing his future. Toure is out of contract at the end of the season \nIt’s been his long-held desire to stay in the Premier League - even if he is forced to leave the Etihad. \nBut with Ilkay Gundogan likely to miss the start of next season, following knee ligament damage, a one-year extension for Toure could be a convenient short-term fix for City. \nGuardiola has refused to offer much in the way of indication that Toure could yet have a future at the club - but does plan to discuss the veteran’s position with City’s hierarchy.
