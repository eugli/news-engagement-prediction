I wrote to them in January to clarify arrangements on the buffalo farm,\" Ms Barnes said. \nThe NLC said the question of who was responsible for the farm was \"complicated\" and was linked to disputes over land ownership.

(Supplied: Mt McMinn) No-one can answer who is responsible: Senator \nAfter the estimates hearing, Ms Siewert raised even more questions over the status of the farm, saying it was her understanding there was not even a lease in place. \n\"No-one can answer question of who is responsible for management of that area and whether it's consistent with the park plan and its world heritage values,\" Senator Siewert said. \n\"It still has World Heritage listing and is part of the park.\" \nAfter the eradication of diseased buffalo in the park in 1997, the farm was set up with a buffalo herd to provide meat to traditional owners. Since then, the farm has been managed by former ranger Dave Lindner. \n\"It's a long-standing arrangement and there are a number of interesting characters involved in the farm and its history including Dave Lindner, who was a former ranger at the park and has got family members employed by the park,\" NLC chief executive Joe Morrison said. \nMr Lindner told the ABC in December he was distributing meat from the farm to 400 Indigenous people, but some other traditional owners said they were missing out. \n\"It doesn't do that, I haven't seen or received any meat from the farm for 15 years, it is not doing what it was initially set up for,\" traditional owner Frieda Peterson said at the time. \nMr Lindner denied those claims. \nThe NLC said it was aware that some traditional owners had concerns about the farm. \n\"We're very mindful of the fact that having buffalo for the purpose of supplying meat in a place like Kakadu is important for traditional owners, but obviously there needs to be some reasoning as to the impact of... a farm that is potentially having negative effects not just within the traditional owners but also on the environment in the park,\" Mr Morrison said. \nHe said the NLC was trying to resolve disputes over traditional ownership in Kakadu to get to the bottom of who should have the ultimate say about the farm.
