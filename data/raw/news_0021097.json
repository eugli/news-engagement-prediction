We finally have the answer. And to begin with, you're not the only one. According to a team of neuroscientists at Newcastle University, you may be suffering from a genuine brain abnormality that apparently many of us suffer from called misophonia. \nihategum.wordpress.com \nA lot of people have it, but does it qualify as a condition? Although there have been speculations about whether or not it qualifies as a genuine medical condition, a new report published in the journal Current Biology claims that people with misophonia have differences in their front lobe as compared to non-sufferers. \nnymag.com This part of the brain is also connected differently to the amygdala and the hippocampus—areas that are involved in recalling experiences from the past. That’s probably because misophonia may be heavily connected to recalling bad memories from the past, states the lead researcher Dr Sukhbinder Kumar. Here's what the in-depth scans reveal Brain scans of this region show that people with this condition have an abnormal control over their emotional mechanism, which in turn sends the brain into overdrive when they hear sounds that trigger such a reaction. Additionally, the trigger sounds were found to evoke a heightened physiological response by raising your heart rate and increasing your sweat rate. \ninterez.sk The researchers used an MRI to measure the brains activity of misophonia sufferers vs non-sufferers, by exposing them to a range of sounds. The sounds were categorised into neutral sounds like rain, a busy café, water boiling; unpleasant sounds like a baby crying, a person screaming; trigger sounds like the sound of breathing or eating. As it turns out that there were a few stark differences sufferers of misophonia presented when compared to non-sufferers. Some triggers are stronger than others The most dominant reaction is anger and anxiety, not disgust, says Dr Kumar. Why certain sounds trigger this reaction, and not others remains a mystery. He hopes to identify the brain signature of trigger sounds so they can be used for treatments such as neurofeedback to facilitate people into regulating their reactions by ascertaining the kind of brain activity being produced in their head. \nmisophoniainternational.com Don't Miss ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T11:28:50.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
