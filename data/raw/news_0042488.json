Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport can often tax a traveler’s soul. But with the new fee, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey wants to tax travelers’ pocketbooks too. \nThe agency is considering a proposal to charge passengers an access fee, and it does not matter whether they are coming or going. \n“Travel’s expensive enough,” one traveler said. “They have to have some real rationale to get that extra $4.” \n“I’m probably not in favor of it, because I’m always on a budget,” another traveler said. \n“Four dollars just to leave here?” a third traveler said. “I’m not surprised.” \n“We always get increased fares for something,” a fourth said. “It’s part of life here in New York.” \nThe Port Authority said if enacted, the fee would hit passengers taking any kind of for-hire vehicle – yellow cabs, green cabs, black cars, limousines, and app-based services like Uber. \nTaxi drivers are furious, saying adding another fee will hurt their business and their ability to make ends meet. \n“It’s not good for us,” said driver Adnan Maseer. “Uber is already killing us. Nobody takes taxis anyway now. They’re charging $4 – we’ll have even less business.” \nDrivers pointed out that passengers already pay two surcharges – 50 cents to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and 30 cents for a wheelchair-accessible vehicle access program. \nJavaid Tariq of the New York Taxiworkers Alliance said the Port Authority should rethink the plan. \n“Drivers are struggling to make any money, and on top of that $4, it will create more problems for drivers,” Tariqu said. “Passengers are going to take less taxis.” \nPublic Advocate Letitia James is demanding that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie step in to stop the move. \n“At a time when access to New York City’s airports is already limited, the Port Authority should be focused on improving public transportation options, not increasing burdens on consumers,” she said. \nThe Port Authority said if the fee is imposed, it would go toward airport modernization projects. \nA Port Authority spokesman said most of the nation’s airports already charge an access fee. \nIf approved, the agency would start collecting the fee sometime next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:56:16.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
