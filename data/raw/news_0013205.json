Fani-Kayode who served as spokesperson of the Goodluck Jonathan campaign allegedly received fund from the embattled former national security adviser, Sambo Dasuki and has been charged to court.

Raji also added that since he was new on the case, he would need some time to go over the facts of the case to enable him defend his client effectively. He said: “My Lord, I am just coming into the case, so I crave your indulgence to enable me familiarize myself with the case. “Secondly, looking at the facts of the case and the money involved, I believe that there are other options we can explore. “The case involves the sum of N26 million and the law allows you to explore the option of a plea bargain and so many other options rather than go through trial.” He said his client will take the option of settling out of court if the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) would allow it. Mr Johnson Ojogbane who is the prosecution counsel said he was not opposed to it but the court must recognise the fact that this was the second adjournment on the demand of the defence and therefore wanted a definite date. Justice John Tsoho adjourned the matter till March 14 for commencement of trial. Part of the charges read: “You Femi Fani-Kayode, converted N26 million cash paid from the office of the National Security Adviser for the purpose of media campaign when you ought to have reasonably known that the said funds formed part of an unlawful act contrary to section 15 (2) (b) of the Money Laundering Act.” Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:04:56.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
