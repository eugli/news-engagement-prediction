She also pleaded guilty to larceny over $250 for collecting some $1,400 in welfare benefits after her daughter’s death, which prosecutors said happened in May 2015.\nAdvertisement\nBond entered the plea before Superior Court Judge Janet Sanders. The judge accepted the plea.\nBond is to be sentenced to probation and time served. She has been in jail for 1 1/2 years already.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here Her plea agreement calls for her to testify against her then-boyfriend, Michael P. McCarthy, who is set to go on trial in Suffolk Superior Court later this year. Her sentence won’t be imposed until after his trial. McCarthy has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail.\nBond allegedly told State Police after her arrest that McCarthy beat her daughter to death in May 2015 after he had volunteered to put the girl to sleep. Bond said she found him standing over her daughter, whose face had turned swollen and gray, the Globe has reported.\nSuffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley’s office has alleged that McCarthy and Bond dumped the girl’s body in the waters off the South Boston waterfront using weights sometime in May 2015. Her body was found across the harbor, on Deer Island, on June 25, 2015, triggering a worldwide effort to identify her.\nAdvertisement\nA friend alerted police in September 2015 that Rachelle Bond had confessed that her daughter had been murdered and thrown into the harbor.\nBond pleaded guilty in a calm and quiet voice. She showed little emotion except when prosecutor David Deakin described the moment she walked into her daughter’s bedroom and saw McCarthy over the little girl’s body. Bond, who hid her face behind her hair and did not look at anyone but the judge, began sniffling. Her attorney handed her a tissue.\nDeakin said the state worked out the plea deal with Bond because she had cooperated with the investigation, had not participated in her daughter’s death, and planned to testify against McCarthy. That testimony, he said, was very important.\nAfter Bond pleaded guilty, her attorney, Janice Bassil, said Bond “from the moment I met her, wanted nothing more than to see Michael McCarthy convicted for the murder of her daughter.”\n“She frankly lives at this point to see Michael McCarthy convicted,” she said.\nBond lived for her daughter and had tried to provide a good life for her, Bassil said. She had no knowledge that McCarthy would kill the girl, and was threatened and coerced to stay quiet afterwards.\n“I do see her as a victim in this case,” Bassil said. “She has gone through a lot and wants to see it through to the end.”\nMore coverage Dorchester mother, boyfriend charged in Baby Doe case Glimpses of a happy girl, despite a hard life Father of slain toddler tells how he learned of her death Kevin Cullen: For officers, it was all about Bella Photos: Bella, girl at center of Baby Doe probe Live updates on the Baby Doe case Thomas Farragher: Baby Bella was right here.
