Slot to Denver Broncos Newsletter Newsletter \nMuch has changed since ESPN draft guru Todd McShay released his first 2017 NFL mock draft . \nIn his initial version, McShay had the Denver Broncos picking at No. 23 overall and choosing Florida defensive tackle Caleb Brantley . \nNow, with the draft order finalized and team needs becoming more clear, he's flipped the Broncos' selection (No. 20) to Wisconsin offensive tackle Ryan Ramczyk . \nWhat's next for the Denver Broncos? Donâ€™t miss out on any news, take a second to sign up for our FREE Broncos newsletter! \nMcShay makes the case to take Ramczyk -- not Alabama's Cam Robinson or Utah's Garett Bolles . \nThe first offensive lineman comes off the board at No. 20, which would be the lowest ever since the 1970 merger. This is a weak O-line class. Ramczyk, who's recovering from hip surgery, has the best tape of the group. He also has just one year of major college experience after transferring from UW-Stevens Point (Division III). Long and well-built, Ramczyk would serve as a much-needed upgrade for the Broncos up front. \nRamczyk comes with medical baggage, as he underwent hip surgery in January, but would represent an immediate upgrade on Denver's lackluster offensive line. A first-team All-Big Ten selection in 2016, Ramczyk is billed by scouts as a strong yet athletic blocker. He's drawn comparisons to 49ers OT Joe Staley . \nThe Broncos are expected to revamp their O-line this offseason, potentially chopping both starting tackles, Russell Okung and Donald Stephenson . \nFollow Zack Kelberman on Twitter: @Kelberman247 Author ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:30:42.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
