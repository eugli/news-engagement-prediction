We are destroyed, ruined.\n'We have invested out life savings over here.\n'Our pets are too old to make the flight back to South Africa where I am not welcome anyway as I am British.\n'We pay our taxes and National Insurance contributions. We serve the community, we are loved and love back. We are not refugees slipping into the country trying to take benefits.'\nThe couple do not pay themselves a salary from their business, Photo Matters, in Devon\nMrs Freathy added: 'We had a couple of nasty incidents in Johannesburg. Five armed gunman came into our house and held up the gentleman who wormed for us. He was tied up and all our belongings were taken in trucks.\n'I was fortunate I came in just after they left and Paul was at work. But it was the last straw.\n'I was hijacked with my daughter in my car and Paul had vehicles stolen. We had been mugged. We didn't want to live like that.\n'Paul was born in Chelsea and he has relatives buried in Brixham graveyard close to where we rent our home in Devon.\n'We are remarkably fortunate to live here where we don't have to look over our shoulder and mistrust everybody. It has been a wonderful experience.'\nHer mother is in a care home in Johannesburg and last weekend her daughter got married there – but Gail could not go because the Home Office seized her passport.\nShe has posted letters in a last minute bid to settle her affairs here and postpone any deportation action.\n'All I can hope for is that someone will listen,' she said.\nMrs Freathy has to prove she earns £23,000 a year but their personal accounts did not reflect that because they ploughed their profits back into their business.\nShe said: 'We work together, we live together, we love together. We are a team. I cannot consider living part for a year.\n'If we had £62,000 in our account for the last six months and showed we are no burden on the State, I could stay.\n'We don't claim any benefits. Paul had type 1 and 2 diabetes and I help him with that, it is another reason not to be apart.\n'If we have to return to South Africa Paul wont get a job at nearly 59. He is not South African, he has a British passport and they don't like that. It wont be easy for me to get work either.\n'We don't know anyone in Europe so there is nowhere else for us to go.\n'We have a rescue dog called Chutney who is 13 and very elderly. She has been all round the world with us, I can't leave her here because I may never see her again.\n'There is a chance I could be arrested or detained or given a police station reporting condition so I don't disappear. At Heathrow Airport I could be escorted on to a plane like a criminal.'\nThe Home Office said it 'cannot discuss individual cases', adding: 'Each visa application is carefully considered on its individual merits and in line with the rules.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T15:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:49:22.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
