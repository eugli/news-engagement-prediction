Ahead of its unveiling at the 2017 Geneva Auto Show, the company will fully reveal the fourth Range Rover SUV on 1st March, 2017. The word 'Velar' has been derived from the original Range Rover prototypes of 1969. The word 'Velar', in Latin – velare, means to veil or cover.\n“We call the Velar the avant garde Range Rover. It brings a new dimension of glamour, modernity and elegance to the brand. The Range Rover Velar changes everything,” Land Rover Chief Design Officer Gerry McGovern said on the unveiling of the new Range Rover.\nThe new Range Rover Velar is likely to share its platform with the Jaguar F-Pace. The bird’s eye view of the Velar SUV indicates that the car manufacturer will offer the SUV with four doors, a panoramic sunroof and a larger infotainment system than the one offered on the current models.\nThe carmaker has not disclosed any details about the Range Rover Velar, but we expect the new SUV Velar will share its design and styling with the current Evoque. It is also expected that the Velar will be bigger in terms of dimensions than the Evoque. Land Rover might also equip the SUV with more and improved safety and other convenience features, such as all-wheel drive system and traction control. The carmaker might also offer the Velar with a choice of both petrol and diesel engines. More information on the upcoming Range Rover Velar like pricing, variants and engine options will be available during its world premier on 1st March, 2017.\nAlso read: Land Rover Discovery Sport petrol gets a price cut of Rs 7 lakh\nThe carmaker might also offer the Velar with a choice of both petrol and diesel engines.
