Southwest is the leading candidate for a buyout, the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. “Of the Big 4, we highlight LUV’s domestic focus, robust and sustainable FCF (free cash flow), range of growth opportunities, defensible cost structure, and more tenured management team, which we are rolling through our updated bull case of $76,” Lalwani’s note added. The analysts also cited Buffett’s history in the railroad industry. Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charles Munger has said he sees similarities between railroad consolidation and airline consolidation. “Finally they got down to four big railroads and it was a better business,” Munger said at a conference last week in Los Angeles. “Something similar is happening in the airline business.” Berkshire acquired Fort Worth-based Burlington Northern Santa Fe in 2010, paying more than $26 billion for the approximately 77 percent of the railroad that it didn’t already own. Berkshire had previously bought minority stakes in BNSF, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific, and sold the competitors’ stocks after the acquisition. The BNSF acquisition was Berkshire’s biggest trade ever. The Morgan Stanley analysts pointed to record profits for airlines, lower fuel prices and consolidation as reasons Buffett and Berkshire might acquire an airline entirely. “U.S. airlines have structurally changed for the better following consolidation that has resulted in more pricing power, supply discipline, and a focus on margins over market share,” Morgan Stanley’s Lalwani wrote. “An interest in industries with structural improvement and the gradually growing stakes are fairly consistent with Berkshire’s approach to acquiring Burlington Northern Santa Fe.” Buffett and Berkshire have not confirmed they are angling for an airline buyout.
