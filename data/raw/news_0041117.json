The other was a slightly smaller male. \nBimini Sharklab, which also posted the photo to Facebook , stated that the shark “was so large that we struggled measuring her on the boat.” She was estimated to be at least 20 years old. \nSaid Smukall: “After this quick [sampling and tagging] workup by Sharklab staff and volunteers she was released in very good condition and swam away strong.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:39:34.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
