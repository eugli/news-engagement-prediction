The first installment in a planned anthology series , Bette and Joan centers on the legendary behind-the-scenes (and occasionally onscreen) battles between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as they tried to revive their careers by starring in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? Murphy repertory player Jessica Lange plays Crawford, while Susan Sarandon is the imperious Davis. The show also features Alfred Molina, Stanley Tucci, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Judy Davis, Kiernan Shipka (a.k.a. Sally Draper), and Alison Wright (Martha from The Americans lives!).
