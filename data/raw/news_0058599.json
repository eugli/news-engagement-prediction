It’s the pressure from Vijay’s family that led to their split. Since his parents were against Amala acting in films after marriage, she decided to take a break from commercial films.” \n“However, she had to finish shooting for the three films that she had signed before her marriage. Vijay was quite supportive and even when there were rumours linking Amala with certain superstars, he didn’t let any of that affect their relationship. He always gave her the respect she deserves, both, as a wife and an actor,” the friend said. The couple in happier times.

Since there seemed to be no other solution in sight, they both decided to go for a divorce,” Pinkvilla quoted the friend as saying. \nThe former couple came together for the first time in 2011 when Amala worked in Vijay’s critically acclaimed flick Deiva Thirumagal with Vikram. They collaborated again in 2013 for Thalaivaa where she was paired opposite actor Vijay. \nFollow @htshowbiz for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:11:23.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
