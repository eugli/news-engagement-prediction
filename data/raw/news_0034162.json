But photos of Austin decades ago prove that the best city in America has always been pretty great.\nThe Houston neighbor may not be as diverse as the Bayou City, but its history runs just as deep within Texas. The village of Waterloo was established in 1837 and has grown into what modern Americans know as Austin.\nFULL REPORT: Austin lands in top 25 of 2017 U.S. News & World Report's Best Places to Live list\nThe cities with the greatest potential for growth in 2017 may not necessarily have famed skylines.\nMedia: ELLE Decor Quickly after settling, Waterloo changed its name to Austin and in 1839 the city became the capital of Texas (which was formally Houston - no hard feelings or anything). The name Austin was chosen to honor Stephen F. Austin, who was considered the \"Father of Texas\" and the republic's first secretary of state.\nPhotos of these early times don't exist, but there are quite a few from 1900 and beyond.
