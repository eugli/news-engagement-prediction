Martinelli 8:02 p.m. ET Feb. 21, 2017 \nDAYTONA BEACH, FL - FEBRUARY 19: Dale Earnhardt Jr., driver of the #88 Nationwide Chevrolet, stands on the grid during qualifying for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series 59th Annual DAYTONA 500 at Daytona International Speedway on February 19, 2017 in Daytona Beach, Florida. (Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images) (Photo: Getty Images) \nDale Earnhardt Jr. has been a dedicated Washington Redskins fan basically his entire life. \nBut more than just rooting for them, he's vocal with his opinions about what moves they should make this offseason. He recently took to Twitter to advocate for finalizing a deal with quarterback Kirk Cousins and going \"heavy on defense\" in the draft this year. \nAnd nearly two months later and five days out from the Daytona 500, Earnhardt's opinion on the matter has only gotten stronger - no doubt echoing the thoughts of impatient Washington fans everywhere: \"Sign the damn quarterback up.\" \n\"Quarterbacks don't grow on trees,\" he argued. \"You're taking such a huge risk in the draft trying to acquire one. You look at the talented quarterbacks in the NFL and where they were drafted - not all of them were first-round picks, so it's not about trying to get the college star. \n\"We've got a guy that knows the system and that has done extremely well - set franchise records, broke his own franchise record last year [in total passing yards]. Sign the damn quarterback up. Sign him up. I'm tired of waiting. Don't even franchise tag him this season. Get him signed up.\" \nAs a longtime fan, Earnhardt was not only clear about the path he hopes the team takes, but he was also adamant about what can't happen in Washington if the team parts ways with Cousins. Though a long shot, Tony Romo can't wear Burgundy and Gold if the Dallas Cowboys trade or release him. \n\"That would be awful,\" Junior said. \"Tony Romo's a Cowboy, and I don't think I would feel comfortable as a Redskins fan with him as the quarterback.\" Read or Share this story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/dale-earnhardt-jr-washington-redskins-kirk-cousins-franchise-tag-tony-romo/ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:13:51.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
