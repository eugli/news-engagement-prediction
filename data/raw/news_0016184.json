(THE CANADIAN PRESS / Liam Richards) CTVNews.ca Staff Published Thursday, February 2, 2017 7:21PM EST Last Updated Thursday, February 2, 2017 7:49PM EST \nWARNING: This story contains offensive language \nThe controversial campaign manager for Kellie Leitch has resigned, saying he had become “a distraction.” \nIn a statement posted to Facebook, Nick Kouvalis said that when “a member of a campaign team becomes the focus of media coverage, the time comes to resign.” \nKouvalis recently apologized for calling a political science professor a “cuck,” short for cuckold, an insult used by some Donald Trump supporters in the U.S. to attack supporters of Hillary Clinton. The insult has an even more offensive meaning among members of the so-called \"alt-right.\" \nHe was also the subject of a recent Maclean’s Magazine profile that looked at his political tactics, and his work with Toronto Mayor John Tory in the city’s last municipal election.
