All these years later, as Showtime is preparing to unleash the 18-part revival series, her face emerges in the first of two new Twin Peaks posters. \nKyle MacLachlan returns as Special Agent Dale Cooper, whose face lurks around the first key art of the revival , premiering in May. The character initially came to Twin Peaks to investigate Palmer’s mysterious death.
