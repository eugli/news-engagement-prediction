The Android powered set-top box was originally announced at Google I/O back in May 2016, but is now making its way to our country. \nThe Mi Box is supports 4K UHD content playback at 60fps; although most movies don’t actually run at such a high frame rate. It also supports HDR10 standards from Android Nougat. \nSince the device was developed with Google, it will also support Google Cast. A particularly interesting feature since the Chromecast isn’t officially on sale here. \nThere’s no telling if the Mi Game Controller will also be made available at the same time, but we’re not keeping our hopes up. \nXiaomi Malaysia is promising more information soon, but has already said that the Mi Box will go on sale this Friday. It will set you back some RM349; which isn’t too bad at all. 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T11:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:25:32.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
