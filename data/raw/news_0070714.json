I'm so proud of you. I was there too. I saw your sign, it made me laugh. It was the first time that you have ever joined a protest, but one day your very presence at one of the marches, and your carefully crocheted pink hat will badges of honor that your children's children will speak about with reverence. \nYou're still angry. I know, so am I. I've read your posts on Facebook. I've tried to like them all. \nYou've even joined some local, grassroots movements, made it to a few of their meetings, and listened as they spoke about the work ahead. Some of you have already received training to register voters. That's great, we will need you. I worry this administration will support policies aimed at suppressing voter registration and turn-out of minorities. \nSome of you, the most driven among us, have started the work of running for office. That's amazing! You have my vote. It's clear that we need more diversity of leadership at every level of the political process. This has been nothing if not a rousing, much needed, wake-up call for people of all backgrounds to ascend to local, state and national leadership roles. \nHowever, to be honest, most of you are still wondering what to do now that Donald Trump is president. You want to take action, in a real and meaningful way, and you want to take action now. You need a win. I know, so do I. \nI have suggestion: Teach. \nThe most revolutionary act you can do right now is to educate our nation's youth. If you have a four-year degree you can join an alternative certification program and be in your own classroom at the beginning of next school year. I know, six months seems like an eternity under the Trump administration, because you want to take action now. \nOr perhaps you have a great career and want an alternative way to contribute to the resistance. Well, you don't need a certification to volunteer. Monday morning, find a school, especially an inner city school, struggling to even meet basic state requirements, and tell them you want to help. \nI'm not suggesting that this is revolutionary because you will go and impose your political viewpoints on these unsuspecting children. You will never even mention politics. You won't tell them who you voted for, or how afraid you are that years of progress are being unraveled one executive order at a time. \nInstead, you will teach them how to read. That's right, students at all levels need help learning to read. Every two years the National Assessment of Educational Progress provides us with a national report card that measures, among other core contents, literacy. The assessment provides a common yardstick that measures the literacy skills of students across the nation of all races and socio-economic backgrounds, attending both public and private schools. The results are sobering. The 2015 NAEP eighth grade reading results found that only 34 percent of students were reading at or above a proficient level. The same assessment found that 42 percent of students were reading at a basic level and 24 percent at a below basic level. Just to be clear, the NAEP defines proficient as the ability \"to locate and provide facts and relevant information that support a main idea or purpose, interpret causal relations, provide and support a judgment about the author's argument or stance.\" \nThis means that most of our nation's youth aren't capable of reading a complex text and making an informed choice based on the information and nearly a quarter aren't even capable of reading the text. When you look at the data broken down by student groups, you discover that only 16 percent of black students and 21 percent of Hispanic students were reading at the proficient level. \nThe political implications of this are devastating. In a very short period of time those eighth graders will be able to vote. They will be bombarded with multiple news sites -- real and fake -- from competing social media platforms. Some of them, with the reading level of meme, will cast their votes based on misinformation fed to them by predatory political campaigns. This will almost certainly hurt their communities in the long run. \nIf you really want to strengthen the resistance, head to an inner city school in a mostly immigrant community. You will find the students at these schools face the challenge of not only learning to read but also of navigating the nuances of a complex language that is not their first. This is in addition to the fact that many come from families struggling with generational poverty. Their parents often work long hours just to provide basics, forcing some students to assume grown-up roles. \nIn addition, the plagues of impoverished inner cities often sully our students with emotional scars. If you aren't confident in your academic skills, consider volunteering to mentor kids. Schools are full of young people living with grandparents or other family members because their parents are in prison or unable or unwilling to care for them. You will meet young ones who suffer from anxiety and depression due to years of chronic stress from the turmoil that so often accompanies broken families and poverty. If you volunteer for any length of time, you will also meet students who have suffered abuse, violent crime or addiction to alcohol or drugs. All of these realities exist in the entire education system but are magnified in inner city communities ravaged by decades of poverty, violence and limited choices for mental healthcare. \nYour work will be revolutionary because it will give these youth in our most fragile communities the skills to wage war against an opportunistic bully. In the next four years, the youth in these marginalized communities will be tested by a consistent barrage of policies aimed at undermining their civil liberties and silencing their right to political dissent. Students will need the ability to accurately comprehend complex policy documents and then take action in legal ways that will benefit their families and communities. \nThey might be confronted by members of law enforcement, motivated by racism, who will overstep their legal rights and place some of these students, especially our black and brown boys, in precarious situations that will threaten not only their manhood, but also their humanity. They will need the emotional fortitude to stay calm in the moment, and they will need the astute intellect to respond at a time and in a manner that will not only keep them alive, but will also discredit the case of their oppressor. \nAnd sisters, the irony is that you will march through the doors of an underserved school determined to save these kids, and by the time you leave you will discover that these kids will save you. Not in the way that you think. They won't all be gracious or thankful. And they won't all get it, suddenly, just because you arrived. You won't make a significant dent in the achievement gap. And you won't fix the challenges of the impoverished community. \nYou will, however, fight like never before. You will sweat, and cry, and shout, when Miriam learns long division, and Maria writes a coherent paragraph, and Monica questions Dickens. And somewhere during the fight you will find the vigor that cradles the win that you have so desperately been seeking. \nAnd you will know, that regardless of Betsy DeVos, or Breitbart, or a new executive order, you have slaughtered the colossus of paralysis. And that isrevolutionary. \nKae Anderson is an assistant principal at Molina High School in Dallas.
