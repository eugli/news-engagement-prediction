Otherwise, PAS vice-president Iskandar Abdul Samad and several others would not be in the state government line-up. But PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang sings a different tune. \nHow hypocritical can PAS be? Selangor voters are not blind, and will throw them out in the next election. \nKim Quek: Iskandar, I quote your own words on the PAS-PKR-DAP-Amanah partnership in Selangor: \n“There is good cooperation among all parties in the state government”, “The people in Selangor have enjoyed the benefit from the Pakatan Rakyat administration”, “It shows that PAS is not an East Coast or Malay belt party, but a national party”, “PAS' involvement in Selangor has proven the party can play a role in a multiracial community, and the slogan of 'PAS for All' is not merely a rhetoric but it has been realised”. \nPray tell us then, why is it that the chemistry of PAS-PKR-DAP-Amanah works wonders in Selangor, but the same partnership suddenly turns insufferable outside Selangor, with DAP and Amanah becoming toxic to PAS? \nIskandar, think deeply and honestly, and you should have the answer. If you still can’t figure it out, go and ask your party president, Hadi. In the answer lies the key to PAS’ survival as a meaningful political player in the country. \nDrngsc: (If the PAS muktamar decides not to cut ties with PKR), then the muktamar is saying that Hadi is talking rubbish. We all have known that for a long time. \nNow PAS is saying the same. Hadi said they do not want any ties with DAP and Amanah, and DAP and Amanah are very much a part of the Selangor government. \nIskandar, can you understand that? You fellows just want power and are insincere in what you say. \nFree And Fair Election: Iskandar, it shows how ignorant you are in understanding your party and the aspirations of Malaysians, especially those in Selangor. \nPAS won some of its seats because PAS was in partnership with DAP and PKR. Now that you choose to go it alone, you may not even win one seat in Selangor. \nCooperate with Umno and see if you are going to win anything in Kelantan and Terengganu. This shows that you have absolute no understanding of what Malaysians in Selangor wants. Dream on. \nGoldee: In GE13, PAS' motto was 'PAS for All' but it has changed since Hadi took over from the late Tok Guru Nik Aziz Nik Mat. \nNow PAS' motto is 'PAS for PAS'. Of course, Selangor is important for PAS because they have never had that many seats in the state in the past. \nSince Hadi has chosen to break from Pakatan Harapan, PAS can forget Selangor. They can just focus on Kelantan. \nRCZ: PAS is a party with a lot of confused men. And dishonest, disrespectful, double-tongued. \nFirst, they want to work with PKR on their terms. Then they don't want to work with PKR on their terms. Then they want their muktamar to decide this. \nHello PAS, wake up. The opposition coalition has given you an ultimatum. They choose whether to work with you, not the other way round. \nSarawakian: A sane voice in PAS at last? Will you and your Selangor grassroots break from Hadi if he fulfils his crazy ambitions? \nWhat happened to your memorandum urging the leadership to engage in one-to-one fights with BN? \nA Voice From The Wilderness: PAS leaders have just shown they are only human, and having a devil's mind. \nWhen former US president Bill Clinton was caught with his parts in the wrong place, he denied his sexual adventure... until he was close to being in serious trouble. \nHe went to see the late Nelson Mandela to seek his advice. He was told to be true to himself and tell the whole truth, nothing but the truth. Clinton went back to the States and told the truth - an admittance of his folly that saved his political life. \nPAS leaders, you either have an untrustworthy party leader or your political reckoning is fast coming to an end. The clock is ticking, you are sitting on a time bomb. \nAnonymous_1388029052: I hope at the muktamar, PAS will cut ties with all political parties and decide to stand alone. \nPKR and DAP will then have no further excuse but to throw out PAS from the Selangor administration. Thereafter Selangor residents should ensure that PAS loses all their parliamentary and state seats at the next GE. \nGhostwhowalks: PAS has passed its expiry date in Selangor long ago. All their good men have left to form a new progressive party, Amanah. \nThe opposition should just dissolve the state assembly and call for early elections to prove the point that PAS is irrelevant. \nThis will sent a subtle message to their grassroots to wake them up, and to throw these bunch of current PAS leaders into the waste bin. \nKeturunan Malaysia: By the way, someone once said, \"PAS is nice to cuddle when it is only a cub. The moment it is grown up to an adult tiger, you will see the long fangs protruding out from both sides of its mouth.” \nSo Iskandar, 'PAS for All' applies only to Selangor? Other places, it is not applicable? \nAce: Their position is best described as having the left leg in Sampan A, and the right leg in Sampan B. Eventually, their legs will be torn apart. \nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers. Only paying subscribers can post comments.
