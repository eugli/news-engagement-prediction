It’s a tough game and there’s something really good about that in terms of competition and learning how to compete and win,” he said.\nTrump’s admission that he would allow his son or grandchildren to play football is in direct contrast to the feelings of former President Obama .\nIn a 2014 interview, Obama stated, “I’m a big football fan, but I have to tell you, if I had a son, I’d have to think long and hard before I let him play football.”\nGray also questioned the president on the NFL Players Association’s fight to have medicinal marijuana legalized for use by the players.\n  Democrats Launch Talk-A-Thon In Hopes of Blocking DeVos’ Confirmation   W.Va.
