Variety is reporting that Jack Nicholson has signed on to play the title character in an already green lit American remake that tells the story of a father trying to reconnect with his daughter the good old fashioned way: by creating an alter-ego and pretending to be a life coach for her CEO. Maren Ade, who wrote and directed of the original, will produce the English-language version that is being developed by Gloria Sanchez Productions, the female-focused offshoot of Adam McKay and Will Ferrell’s Gary Sanchez banner. Toni Erdmann is not only an Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, but was given the distinction by Vulture of having the best nude scene of any movie in 2016. It’s also the first screen role for Jack Nicholson since the rom-com How Do You Know from 2010.\nTags: movies jack nicholson casting couch toni erdmann Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Beyoncé Is Being Sued for Allegedly Using ‘Formation’ Sample Without Permission Paolo Sorrentino Explains The Young Pope ’s Opening Credits The Americans Season 5 Trailer: Paige Is Officially a Spy-in-Training Most Viewed Stories Trump Reportedly Upset That Sean Spicer Was Portrayed by a Woman on SNL Only Richard Branson Could Help Obama Cram 8 Years of Relaxation Into One Vacation The Bachelor Recap: Nick in Retrograde What’s New on Netflix: February 2017 Jane the Virgin Recap: A Chapter Ends What to Stream Now See what's new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBO Why Jane the Virgin ’s Gut Punch Was a Good Thing 100 More Jokes That Shaped Modern Comedy Melissa McCarthy’s Sean Spicer Impression Is an Instant SNL Classic Every Super Bowl Halftime Show Since 1993, Ranked From Worst to Best John Oliver Has Nothing But ‘Contempt’ for the White House Correspondents’ Dinner Most Popular Video On Vulture There's a Great Reason Why You Don’t See the Shark in Jaws Much Latest News from Vulture 11 mins ago Katy Perry Teases Her New Song ‘Chained to the Rhythm’ Looks like the single will drop Friday, February 10.\n25 mins ago Jack Nicholson Will Return to the Screen in American Remake of Toni Erdmann Jack is back.\n6:58 p.m. Jane the Virgin’s Brett Dier on Michael and This Week’s Big Episode “Well, it’s the most tweets I’ve ever gotten in my life.”\n6:15 p.m. Manchester by the Sea ’s Lucas Hedges Has No Time for FOMO “I’m not getting a lot of sleep, but I am getting a lot of frequent-flyer miles.”\n5:54 p.m. 8 Best New Songs of the Week: Syd, Future Islands, Mac DeMarco, and More Mac DeMarco and Future Islands return to soundtrack these strange times.\n5:50 p.m. Beyoncé Is Being Sued for Allegedly Using ‘Formation’ Sample Without Permission The estate of bounce artist Messy Mya is leading the suit.\n5:23 p.m. Join Us for a Live Talk With The OA ’s Brit Marling Meet The OA at 10 a.m. tomorrow.\n5:09 p.m. Paolo Sorrentino Explains The Young Pope ’s Opening Credits Those paintings!\n5:06 p.m. Shondaland Is Turning Luvvie Ajayi’s Book I’m Judging You Into a TV Series The comedy will be based on Luvvie Ajayi’s best-selling debut book I’m Judging You: The Do-Better Manual. \n4:55 p.m. WATCH: Without SNL Kyle Mooney Never Could Have Made This Bold Film “The most sincere realization of the man-child since Tom Hanks in Big .”\n4:52 p.m. The Origins of Hollywood Shuffle ’s Enduring Satire ‘Black Acting School’ “Chappelle said when he saw the film, it made him want to do sketch comedy.
