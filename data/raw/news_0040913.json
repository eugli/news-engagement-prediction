The 21-year-old helped the designer show off his collection alfresco as she wore a knitted hat But there was no chance of the model showing off too much this time around, as she walked out in a layered look. The reality star was dressed in a corduroy ensemble featuring wide leg flared pants and a matching burgundy jacket. The jacket featured wider wale and a brown shearling collar and lapel with hints of leather. The jacket was layered over the top of a classic grey knit sweater and Kendall then had a turtleneck with a big gold zipper. While Marc had set up heat lamps to keep the models warm as they posed, Kendall certainly did not need it. Unexpected: Celebrity guests including Katy Perry, Amanda Peet, Sara Sampaio and someone who knows a lot about hip hop and the time period, Lil Kim, initially sat inside expecting a traditional show That's different: But there was no chance of the model showing off too much this time around, as she walked out in a layered look With her body already being kept toasty, the model's head also was not about to get cold thanks to an exaggerated knitted hat, that was part beanie part bucket cap. The grey headpiece made the star's head and face look tiny in comparison. Also ensuring that it was the clothes and not her famous face get all the attention, Kendall's makeup was very subdued. Each model got a different look for the show, and the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star's consisted of no color, no lip shade or even eyeliner. Aside from the big hat, the look was accessorized with giant buckled platforms and a hip hop required gold chain. Toasty: While Marc had set up heat lamps to keep the models warm as they posed, Kendall certainly did not need it And pose: The models sat down and started snapping selfies as part of the show After her walk Kendall took position with the other models on a chair and, as instructed, whipped out her iPhone and started shooting selfies. Also walking in the parade was Winnie Harlow, who got a more toned down felt bucket hat to wear along with a fur jacket and knee-high boots. It was obvious from the get go that Marc was taking his inspiration from the style of Nineties hip hop. Style star: Also walking in the parade was Winnie Harlow, who got a more toned down felt bucket hat to wear along with a fur jacket and knee-high boots Surprisingly wearable: But not all the models were dressed in as over-the-top looks as Kendall's, with the collection featuring patterned, gold metallic and velvet dresses worn with shearling lined jackets Big return: LL Cool J can start wearing his oversize furry Kangol bucket hats again because this designer is bringing them back (pictured 1987) But not all the models were dressed in as over-the-top looks as Kendall's, with the collection featuring patterned, gold metallic and velvet dresses worn with shearling lined jackets. Katy Perry certainly seemed to enjoy the show, the star abandoning her front row seat to film the models outside. Katy was also wrapped up in layers, wearing a flowing sun dress with Victorian collar over a pair of loathe trousers and then an army green jacket over the top. Big fan: Katy Perry certainly seemed to enjoy the show, the star abandoning her front row seat to film the models outside Ready for their close ups: Katy wore a Victorian collar over a pair of loathe trousers, while Mandy Moore wore a similar dress but kept things a bit more simple Mandy Moore wore a similar dress but did so in a more traditionally styled way, wearing it over just black tights. Sara Sampaio was certainly not blending in, with the model rocking as black and hot pink fur coat with exaggerated shoulders. No doubt flamboyant rapper Lil Kim approved of the look, with the hip hop icon standing out as always in a gold leather and fur jacket.
