(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)  44 PM \nThe most powerful person in the world might actually be crazy. For sure, he is dangerous. Worse, he’s American. \nThe most powerful person in the world is a pathological liar who has convinced a great swath of this nation that we, the press, are the crazy, pathological liars; that we are the enemies not just of the American people but we are enemies of the truth. \nCan we stop for a moment to reflect on how very dangerous it is for the President of the United States to stomp on the First Amendment? \nWe in the press have become the bad guys because we won’t give up OUR First Amendment rights. \nThe founding fathers considered freedom of the press, along with the freedom of speech, religion (also dangerously under attack), assembly and to petition the government so important that these freedoms became the first amendment to the Constitution. Not the second, not the tenth, but the first. \nThe Founding Fathers understood, unlike our unhinged President, that these freedoms are guaranteed to all citizens in a free society. When that starts to erode — even supposedly “for our safety” — so do the foundations of our democracy. Donald Trump in the White House \nBizarrely, on Friday, at the exact moment that I wrote, “the news media has become the enemy of the state,” President Trump actually tweeted that the news media is the “enemy of the American people.” \nThen, like a petulant teen, he revised it to include “(failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN), is not my enemy it is the enemy of the American People. SICK!” \nSick? Americans have the right — no, the obligation — to question what the government is selling every minute of every day. And further, to then expose that which actually IS fake news whether that comes from the media, the oval office or conspiracy websites. \nCalling the free press the enemy is perhaps one of the most traitorous things an American President could ever say. \nThis is nothing short of a declaration of war against freedom of the press. \nNo? Explain how hundreds of thousands of reporters secretly colluded to create fake news stories. Explain how that could even be possible in a world where information — and leaks — travel faster than Trump discards wives. \nExplain how the President can deny news stories in the face of hard evidence. \nOn Friday, for example, the Associated Press broke a story based on a leaked 11-page memo that said Homeland Security was mulling a plan to mobilize 100,000 National Guard troops to round up undocumented immigrants. \nKristallnacht, anyone? Sick! (SHAWN THEW/EPA) \nWhite House flack Sean Spicer jumped in, announcing, “That is 100% not true. It is false. It is irresponsible to be saying this.” \nSo did the AP make up a story? No, the White House later spun the memo as being nothing more than an early draft. Right. \nThe founders of this nation put the First Amendment in place to protect us from a tyrannical government that could censor the press, dictate which religions are acceptable and which citizens would be free to speak, protest and report. \nTo paraphrase Pastor Martin Niemöller’s poem, If you don’t stand up for a free press, who will be left to stand up for you? NO ‘LIE,’ SHOW IS GREAT Nicole Kidman is pictured in HBO's \"Big Little Lies.\" (HBO) \nTonight at 9 you can either attempt to figure out who got killed or who’s getting eaten alive when HBO’s delicious (not as in human consumption) limited series “Big Little Lies” premieres against AMC’s “The Walking Dead” (as yes, in human consumption). \nHere’s what should make you record one and savor the other afterwards. \nThe most compelling reason to watch “The Walking Dead” is that one day we will finally see Negan get killed or maybe chewed to un-death before he chews up what’s left of the scenery. In fact, Negan actor Jeffrey Dean “You Got Any Ham To Go With All That Cheese” Morgan has chewed up so much scenery that there was so little left that producers had to use a fake paper house interior last week. Please kill Negan and his dumbbat Lucille, so Morgan can get on to eating others instead of the scenery. \"Walking Dead\" viewers may one day get to see Negan get what's coming to him. (Gene Page/AMC) \nThe most compelling reason to tune in to “Big Little Lies” is that you’ll become so addicted that you’ll need rehab to battle withdrawal when it ends. But you’ll love it while it lasts. \nNo ham or cheese nor scenery chewing from Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley or Zoe Kravitz — although there is a lot of coffee drinking. \nYou won’t believe who done it or why — and you won’t find out until the last episode. Yummy! HATERS GONNA HATE \nIt didn’t take more than a minute for the critics to start piling the hate on Mayor de Blasio immediately after he (finally) wrapped his over-the-top State of the City speech. \nAnd the haters are right. I personally hate him for settling over 150 outstanding municipal labor contracts which had been ignored by Mayor Bloombucks. \nI hate Mayor de B for adding 1,300 cops and reducing crime to the lowest levels in New York City’s history, even as other cities hit historic highs. I hate that this happened even though he eliminated stop-and-frisk, which was supposed to spike horrible crime waves. \nI hate de Blasio for adding or preserving 21,963 units of affordable housing in 2016, the most since 1989. This, even as we are still reeling from Bloomberg’s destruction of our beloved neighborhoods with ugly, expensive high rises for extremely high rollers. Mayor de Blasio: hated by everyone. (Todd Maisel/New York Daily News) \nI hate Big Bill for overseeing the most efficient snow removal in recent memory — especially after the biggest snow storm in recent memory. \nI also despise him for reducing pedestrian traffic deaths through Vision Zero from 138 in 2015 to 85 in 2016. \nBut mostly I hate the mayor for efficiently building facilities and, in three short years, enrolling 150,000 children in pre-K (half of whom live in shelters), taking an enormous burden off working parents. \nNo wonder New Yorkers hate him. FELON GUILTY OF STEALING SHOW AT FASHION WEEK \"Hot Convict\" Jeremy Meeks (Diane Bondareff/AP) \nDesigner Phillip Plein managed to steal all the attention from every other designer during Fashion Week by not trying. He did two brilliant things. He invited Tiffany Trump, whose mere presence created a hate-fest, and he invited mug shot model/hot felon Jeremy Weeks to walk his walk up and down the runway, turning the haters into lovers. Prison Bae’s shirtless candid shots backstage nearly broke the Internet. I don’t know what Hot Felon is selling but I know I’m buying. How did Calvin Klein miss the Bae watch babe? Oh right, Bae was behind bars.
