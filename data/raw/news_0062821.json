You do whatever it takes to play at a 100% each and every night. I know that the facility that they’re building down here is going to be even more suitable than what we have now.” \nRelated: What the Pistons' new practice facility means for Detroit \nFriday’s announcement means the franchise truly will become New Center stakeholders. Palace Sports & Entertainment vice chairman Arn Tellem estimated the 100,000-square-foot project would cost around $50 to $60 million, in what was promised to be the best facility of its kind in the league. \nIt will feature: \n• A more modern player locker room and lounge. \n• A full-service kitchen and personal chef. \n• A weight room facility with state-of-the art equipment. \n• Film and study meeting rooms. \n• Advanced training room capabilities with full hydro and cryogenic treatment systems. \n• Green space and courtyard locations for outside access and views of the city. \n• A new sports medicine building – connected to the training facility. \nThe plan is to begin construction this summer and to open before the 2018-19 season. \n“This gives us a daily presence,” Pistons coach and president of basketball operations Stan Van Gundy said after the news conference. “We’re not just commuting down from the suburbs to play a game now that we’re firmly rooted in the city. I know the hopes are that facility also becomes a community asset in a lot of different ways.” \nThe Pistons become the latest franchise to either build a new facility or propose a new place. \nThe Philadelphia 76ers opened a new facility in Camden, N.J. before this season. \nThe Chicago Bulls opened a $25 million practice facility across the street from the United Center in 2014. \nThe facilities are more than just places for players to practice, rehab and work on their games. Meshing basketball, business operations and medical care under the same roof is reason for excitement. \nRendering of Detroit Pistons practice facility (Photo: Detroit Pistons) \nContract value is the predominant factor free agents weigh on the market, but this completed project could impress. \nTellem and Pistons officials Pat Garrity and Andrew Loomis have scouted the newer facilities and plan to do more of it. \nVan Gundy hopes to bring the best modern technology, in all phases of the game, to the new place. \n“Playing in a new arena and having a state-of-the-art practice facility, the practice facility is really the home of the players,” Tellem said. “They spend more time there than anywhere else. For us, it’s going to be really important to help us retain our top players and attract new talent. It’s absolutely critical.” \nRelated: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T13:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:10:08.175+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
