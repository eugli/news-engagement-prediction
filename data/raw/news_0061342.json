PM's attack on SA 'unprecedented': Weatherill \nThe proposal comes amid a bitter debate about the reliability and affordability of South Australia's power supply. External Link: Facebook Malcolm Turnbull \nAfter 90,000 homes suffered blackout due to load shedding this month and post last year's statewide blackout, Premier Jay Weatherill threatened to go it alone on power, with a \"dramatic intervention\" promised to be unveiled within weeks. \nBut in a video on social media, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has warned without a coordinated plan between all governments, more states will end up like South Australia with the \"most expensive and least reliable electricity\". \nMr Weatherill said Mr Turnbull had attacked the state to protect his leadership. \n\"I mean it's unprecedented, I can't recall a prime minister who has singled out a state for this attention in the past and it's just simply false it's a national electricity market that's failing not just South Australia but the rest of the nation,\" Mr Weatherill said. \nIn the lead up to the last federal election, Mr Weatherill said the Prime Minister had praised South Australia for its leadership role on renewable energy. \n\"Fast forward a few months with a Parliament where he's hanging on by a thread where he's got right wingers like Tony Abbott who are up one side and down the other side of him, he's had to sacrifice what he knows to be true about energy policy and the need to integrate into climate change policy,\" he said. \nFederal Government Minister Senator Simon Birmingham said Mr Weatherill's criticism was unsurprising. \n\"Jay Weatherill is a desperate premier desperately struggling for his survival, in a state where we are seeing record levels of unemployment,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:02:06.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
