What happened was, our partner on the left side of the stage, Brian Cullinan, he handed the wrong envelope to Warren Beatty. And then the second we realized that, we notified the appropriate parties and corrected the mistake.” \nBeatty, who presented best picture with Faye Dunaway, was given a duplicate envelope naming La La Land star Emma Stone as best actress. Although Stone had kept the original envelope from her win, there are two sets of envelopes printed, with one set held by a PWC representative on either side of the stage. \nWhen the time came for Beatty to reveal the winner, he was visibly confused by the contents of the envelope. Dunaway initially declared La La Land as the best picture winner, and the filmmakers and cast took the stage to give their acceptance speeches. It was only after two minutes — and two-and-a-half speeches — that the blunder was corrected and Moonlight was recognized as the true best picture. \nThe incident stunned Oscars attendees and those watching the broadcast . \nIn the USA Today interview, Ryan added, “We apologize to the cast of La La Land for having to have made those speeches in the time that it took to [correct it]. Immediately when it was announced, again, because of our mistake, both our partners who knew who the winner was — and they’re the only two who know — they realized the mistake had been made and they began to notify the appropriate people.” \nPWC also released a statement early Monday morning apologizing “to Moonlight , La La Land , Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture.” The statement added, “We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation.” Show Full Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:09:54.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
