Credit: PA \nA heterosexual couple have lost their Court of Appeal battle for the right to enter into a civil partnership. \nRebecca Steinfeld, 35, and Charles Keidan, 40, objected to the \"patriarchal baggage\" of marriage and wanted to ensure legal recognition of their seven-year relationship through a civil partnership. \nHowever they were prevented because the Civil Partnership Act 2004 says that only same-sex couples are eligible. The couple, outside the Royal Courts of Justice, last year. Credit: PA \nThe couple, from Hammersmith, west London, have a 20-month-old daughter. \nThey argued the Government's position is \"incompatible with equality law.\" \nMore soon.
