Trending Berkeley violence continues: WATCH video of Trump supporter reportedly attacked TODAY on edge of campus \nWhat a tough guy. @JodiHernandezTV @nbcbayarea I don't remember Republicans acting like this when Obama was elected. They just waited for 4 years to go by. \n— That Girl (@robin_hauff) February 2, 2017 \nBecause Republicans didn’t act like this. @JodiHernandezTV @nbcbayarea This type of behavior against Trump supporters has been happening nationwide for months. Where have u been? \nWhat’s so shocking about this is the fact that it’s so shocking to some people. To this gal’s point, there have been many instances of Trump supporters being attacked physically over the past year. @JodiHernandezTV @hotline_ping006 hope they get that under control.
