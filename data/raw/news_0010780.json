Going by the Instagram and Facebook handle ‘Fitness Kaur’, she is winning hearts all over the world with her insane callisthenics workout routines, weight training, and yoga. Image source: Daily Bhaskar \nHer photos on Instagram show her doing some ridiculously hard routines including push-ups, pull-ups, ring-dips, horizontal planks, and human flag planks. With over 17,000 followers on Instagram and receiving over a thousand likes regularly for her incredible fitness moves, she has become quite the social media sensation. \nBorn to an English mother and a Punjabi father, Gurpreet has always felt a strong connection with her Sikh roots. She visits India frequently and it was on one such visit to the Golden Temple in Amritsar that she experienced one of the greatest moments of her life. After writing her name during the Amrit Sanchar, she felt that the fitness routine affected her mind, body, and soul completely. The prominent Sikh heritage is why this turbaned woman prefers Shabads (Sikh hymns) as her workout groove over the latest music. The soothing music of Shabads gets her going and inspires her to push herself both physically as well as spiritually. \nHere is a video from her Instagram profile : A video posted by Fitness Kaur (@fitnesskaur) on Feb 5, 2017 at 6:27am PST \nKaur was born premature and faced a world that would constantly demotivate her, telling her that, being a girl, she would not be able to do this or that. This kind of discouragement, rather than pulling her down, ended up pushing her to focus her energy on fitness, a journey she began at the age of 17. She is now defying all norms and showing men and women across the globe that nothing is impossible if you have the right mind and determination for it. \nDo you have an interesting story to share?
