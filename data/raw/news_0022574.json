These 5 videos prove so! 7 videos that proof Varun Dhawan is the Govinda of today's times By Soumyata Chauhan | Published: February 11, 2017 5:50 pm Lakme Fashion Week 2017: Varun Dhawan had some fun time with Arjun Kapoor on the ramp \nIn the short span of time that Varun Dhawan has been in Bollywood, he has made a huge name for himself, not just as an actor but as a complete entertainer. His chiseled body, youthful energy and mind-blowing dancing skills gives him an edge over other actors. His latest dance number, Tamma Tamma Again , from his upcoming film Badrinath Ki Dhulania has once again drawn our attention to his meticulous yet care-free kinda dance style. It inevitably reminds us of the Govinda. Varun has somehow brought street-dancing back in vogue. His dance moves,unlike Hrithik Roshan or Tiger Shroff”s, are imitable. In an age where Bollywood is quietly getting rid of its naach-gaana format, Varun somehow reassures our belief in it. There hasn’t been a single movie of his, where he hasn’t danced. I mean he had a dance number in a revenge-drama like Badlapur, too! So you know what we mean. \nHere is a look at 7 songs that proof he is the best dancer among the current lot – \nTamma Tamma Again \nPalat Tera Hero Idhar Hai \nManma Emotion Jaage \nChunar \nThe actor revealed in an earlier interview that he learnt the tricks of dance by watching dance legends like Michael Jackson and Prabhudheva.”As a kid, I used to watch Michael Jackson’s dances on CDs and on television when the dancing star was on world tours. After Youtube came, I watched NTR Junior and Prabhudheva… And picked up a few nuances of dancing,” he confessed. Varun opined that his ABCD 2 co-star Prabhudheva is the best dancer and everybody else, including Hrithik Roshan and Allu Arjun, comes after him.”Prabhudheva is the best in dancing. After him comes everyone… Hrithik Roshan, NTR Junior and Allu Arjun are outstanding,” he said. \nHis exceptional dancing abilities have often led people to compare him to yesteryear dancers of Bollywood but Varun insists that he is no where in the league. “I am new. I don’t even think my name should be mentioned in the league of Bollywood’s best dancers like Mithun Chakraborty, Govinda and Hrithik Roshan. In terms of dancing, Hrithik is an inspiration to our generation. He is brilliant at what he does. That’s his style. My style is different too. So, we should carry on with our own style and don’t compare,” Varun told reporters during the promotion of ABCD 2 . \nBut, we beg to differ, Varun. You have already become a part of this league and comparison is inevitable! What say BollywoodLifers? Do you agree with us? Leave your thoughts in the comments section below.
