UK Muslims urged to raise concerns about Britain's terrorism legislation \nThe country’s new terrorism watchdog declared that he will be ready to recommend the abolition of unnecessary laws Friday 24 February 2017 14:31 GMT Click to followThe Evening Standard Max Hill QC said he wanted to hear from those groups, including Muslims, most affected by the legislation (file photo) Shutterstock / DecemberDah \nMuslims were today urged to raise their concerns about Britain’s terrorism legislation as the country’s new terrorism watchdog declared that he will be ready to recommend the abolition of unnecessary laws. \nMax Hill QC said he wanted to “take soundings from all quarters” about the way that counter-terror powers were working and particularly wanted to hear from those groups, including Muslims, most affected by the legislation. \nHe said that he would also be examining the Terrorism Acts, and other relevant legislation, to assess whether there were offences “introduced in knee jerk reaction” to terrorist atacks that could be abolished because they were either little-used or had become outdated. \nHe added that his own experience as a former prosecutor of terrorism cases, during which he secured the conviction of the failed 21/7 bombers and the jailing last year of two Luton-based Islamic State supporters over a plot to kill a US serviceman, had shown him that parts of the law were “less fit for purpose” than others. \nMr Hill’s comments to the Evening Standard came in his first interview since being appointed this week as the country’s new independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. \nHe said that he was determined to listen to views from all sides, including critics, of the existing laws and to help ensure that the needs of national security and public safety continued to be balanced with the need to avoid excessive infringements on individual liberty. \nHe added: “This is a golden opportunity to take soundings from all quarters and all parties to the debate.
