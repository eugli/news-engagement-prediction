Since it was announced that Danny Dyer is to take a break from his EastEnders role as Mick Carter, there has been a flurry of feverish reports from claims that bosses forced him off the show to sort out his personal life through to articles dredging up interviews from two years ago in which he said he was exhausted. \nAnd now fresh suggestions are saying that bosses are now working on a final and permanent exit for the Queen Vic landlord, as Danny is apparently toying with the idea of quitting the show for good. With so much flying around, let’s remind ourselves of the truth of the matter. \nLike many actors do, Danny is taking a voluntary and short break from the soap. An EastEnders spokesperson said: ‘Danny is on a short break from EastEnders. This was not enforced by bosses, nor has he quit the show. There is absolutely no truth that an exit storyline is being discussed or planned.’ (Picture: BBC) \nSorry scandal fans, but that really seems to be all there is to it. While reports that drunken behaviour at the National Television Awards after party (which Danny didn’t attend) sound like great gossip, sometimes people just take a break from work. \nDanny’s character Mick has been at the centre of dramatic storylines for some time and it’s not unusual for actors to take time off. Steve McFadden and Letitia Dean are currently off screen and around Christmas, Jamie Borthwick also took a short break. Linda Henry also takes time off now and again and her next break will be fairly soon. (Picture: BBC) \nSo when reports come out that Dyer has been abducted by aliens hired by BBC bosses who are intent on replacing him in the show, you know you can take them with a pinch of salt.
