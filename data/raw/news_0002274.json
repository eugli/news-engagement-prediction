They note the 2 clips were shot at different times, raising \"serious questions about their motives and ethics.\" \nMost interesting ... the clip where the dog clearly does not want to go in the water and the trainer gets aggressive with the animal ... the AHA says, \"the handling of the dog ... should have been gentler and signs of stress recognized earlier.\" \nThe Executive Producer of the movie has blasted the AHA , saying the org should have put its foot down when it was on set monitoring the scene and then reported the incident. The Exec Producer told TMZ he believes the AHA is compromised because its in bed with the studios. \nThe AHA says it had a vet check the German Shepherd in question last week and he was a-ok . \nShort story ... the AHA never says it did anything wrong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:42:01.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
