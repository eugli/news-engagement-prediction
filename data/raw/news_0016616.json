The United star has forked out a cool £3 million for this state-of-the-art mansion in Cheshire. \nPogba has snapped up this unreal property which includes five bedrooms, a leisure suite, heated pool, sauna, lounge room and a bunch of other rooms all fitted in a modern and stylish design. \nTime to gawk. Check out the images below via the Manchester Evening News ; from the drive to the stunning indoor swimming pool: \nOutside view of the house. \nA large driveway fitted with a garage. Space for all his cars. \nThe bathroom. \nOne of the many lounges. \nA mansion can't be complete without a games room. \nHuge kitchen with a massive worktop. \nOne of FIVE bedrooms. \nThe property has a very slick design throughout the mansion. \nAnother lounge room. \nAnd another bedroom. \nDining room. \nIt's believed he paid a massive £600,000 below the asking price while the mansion apparently used to house ex-United striker Javier Hernandez and his sister during his tenure at Old Trafford. \nNot only is it a banging mansion but it's also reportedly located just a short drive away from the clubs training complex in Carrington. So no excuses for being late, Paul. Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T15:52:53.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
