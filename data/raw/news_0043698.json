Jack McGanity, 25, who works with Mr Moseley on the building site, handed him the cake at the end of his first week in front of all his colleagues. Mr McGanity said: 'We all just see if he turns up really. However you don't get paid if you don't turn up, which I think he's realised. It was quite an achievement for Jake Moseley (second right) to turn up to work for five days in a row â€“ and his workmates decided to mark the occasion by giving him a cake 'The triple chocolate cake was quite good - it even had party-poppers and candles on it. I was jealous that he got a cake because I wouldn't get one. He laughed his head off.' Boss Matt Bishop, 35, admits he doesn't think being overly strict with his staff is good for morale and prefers to let them do things their own way, as long as they get their work done on time. Mr Bishop said: 'Jake is a great worker when he's there. I am patient and people will come when they want to come. 'This was his first four or five days in a row - he'd never made it into work for that long since he started about three or four months ago. 'He'd never completed a full week. It is normal for labourers to do what they want - it's quite funny really. A workmate of Mr Moseley (second left) handed him the cake at the end of his first week in front of all his colleagues 'I do own the company but that's the thing, we have a good atmosphere and a good time. 'We are always smiling. I don't want an autocratic environment because I prefer taking a more relaxed approach. It seems to work - it's all about autonomy. 'I tell them I need a certain amount lifting in a certain time and if they want to do it backwards wearing wellington boots, they can as long as they get it done. 'In the construction sector, people resent management. We prefer to let people get on with it. 'Jake and Jack are both good guys. They come in and get on with it. It's important to have a happy outlook and remain positive.'
