From photos of the bruises she earned from performing her own stunts to talking about her depression , the actress has shown she&apos;s a fearless individual who has a strong sense of self. Now, in a new interview, the 30-year-old is opening up about another time in her life: when she came out to her mom at 12 years old.\nIn a clip of her upcoming chat on Sunday TODAY with Willie Geist Rose spoke about the experience of being bullied when she was in high school and what it was like to come out to her mother as a pre-teen, * Hello Giggles* reports . \"She knew when I was six apparently,\" Rose told Geist, in reference to her mother. Rose admits she was worried about coming out, but her mother accepted her completely. \"When I told her, she was like, &apos;I know,&apos;” Rose explains.\nThe Orange Is the New Black star&apos;s worries about coming out stemmed from the fact that she knew very little about the LGBTQ community , which made it hard to articulate her own feelings. \"I didn’t know anyone else that was gay or a lesbian,\" she revealed. \"So I didn’t really know how to word it. So I was just like, &apos;I think I should let you know that when I eventually get a boyfriend, there’ll be a girl.&apos; And she was just like, &apos;I know.&apos; \"\nWatch the video, below:\nHopefully, with more public figures like Ruby Rose opening up about who they are, younger generations will feel less alone and be more accepting.", "external_links": ["http://www.self.com/story/ruby-rose-shared-a-hopeful-message-on-instagram-for-those-battling-depression", "http://hellogiggles.com/ruby-rose-coming-out-story-mom/", "http://www.today.com/offsite/ruby-rose-explains-why-she-was-worried-to-come-out-to-her-mother-at-age-12-865415747759", "http://www.self.com/story/ruby-rose-instagrammed-her-gruesome-wound-from-a-stunt-gone-wrong"], "published": "2017-02-04T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:11:37.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
