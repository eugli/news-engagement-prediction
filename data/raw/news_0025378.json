Demonstrators at Chicago's O'Hare Airport protest President Donald Trump's executive order to ban travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, Jan. 29, 2017. Image: Scott Olson/Getty Images By Maria Gallucci 2017-02-13 00:27:45 UTC \nA U.S.-born NASA scientist was apparently one of the thousands of people ensnarled in the Trump administration's now-suspended travel ban. \nSidd Bikkannavar, a natural-born American citizen, said he was detained at Houston's international airport on Jan. 30, just days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. SEE ALSO: Scientists face 'nightmare' amid Trump's Muslim ban \nBikkannavar, who works in NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was on his way back from Santiago, Chile, he told The Verge in an interview published Sunday. \nThe engineer moonlights as a driver of solar-powered racing cars , and he'd spent the last couple of weeks at a race in Patagonia. \nSidd Bikkannavar, who works in NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, also races solar-powered cars. \nImage: Sidd Bikkannavar/PrincipiaAlumni.org \nBikkannavar probably expected to breeze through the immigration and customs process at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. After all, the U.S. passport holder is part of Global Entry, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) program that allows expedited clearance for \"pre-approved, low-risk travelers.\" \nInstead, CBP officers pulled him aside and demanded that he turn over his work-issued phone and access PIN code, Bikkannavar first described in a Feb. 5 Facebook post . \nMashable has contacted Bikkannavar, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and will update this story with any responses. this is from an IRL friend of mine. this is NOT my america. EVER. #MuslimBan Siid is a US Citizen. @CustomsBorder u say \"Welcome Home\" #NASA pic.twitter.com/W4UtF88rJy \n— Nick Adkins (@nickisnpdx) February 6, 2017 \nBikkannavar said he eventually turned over his phone and PIN code to the CBP agents, who sent him to a holding area where other detainees were sleeping on cots. \nNationwide, at least 940 people were prevented from boarding a plane between Jan. 27 — when the executive order took effect — and Feb. 1, the Washington Post reported, citing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. \nThe travel ban is now on hold after a federal judge in Seattle suspended the order on Feb. 3. Last week, an appeals court in San Francisco unanimously upheld that ruling, noting that states had raised serious allegations of religious discrimination. \nBikkannavar said the CBP officer finally returned his phone and allowed him to continue his journey home. \nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory has since issued him a new phone and is now \"running forensics\" to determine whether the border officials had taken any data or installed a device on the phone, the NASA engineer said.
