My heart was out of control. I was terrorized by this call,” says Bashir. \nBashir says he drove to an IRS office, even though he knew he didn’t owe any taxes, and when an employee tried to ask the caller for his badge number, the man on the other end hung up. \n“He kept telling me that I was defrauding the government and after several attempts to reach me, I had not yet paid. Then he said I had 45 minutes to comply or I would be taken to jail,” Bashir says. \nBashir wants to warn others that anyone claiming to be an IRS agent probably isn’t so. \nAnd the IRS corroborates Bashir’s claim. \nThe agency reminds people that they will never call your home and demand money. They add that while these scams occur year round, they tend to pick up around tax time, when people are beginning to, or already have started to file their taxes. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
