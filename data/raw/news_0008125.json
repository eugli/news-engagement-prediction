And if we invest, we'll hire more jobs and more opportunities,\" Mr Turnbull said. \nThe Prime Minister outlined a new plan for childcare while appealing to the hip-pocket to spruik cuts to the business tax rate, claiming economic modelling showed it would save the average worker $750 a year. \n\"Years of research, much of it commissioned by the previous Labor Government, has revealed a less obvious but very important fact — company tax is overwhelmingly a tax on workers and their salaries,\" he said. \nBut the tax cuts have so far proved unpopular with the Senate crossbench, with South Australian Nick Xenophon — who controls three votes in the Upper House — outlining concerns on Wednesday morning. \n\"We will support a tax cut for businesses up to $10 million, but beyond that we remain to be convinced about the need for that,\" he told the ABC. Prime Minister to target energy security in 2017 \nMr Turnbull said the Coalition would prioritise energy security and storage, citing a total blackout in South Australia last year as a catalyst for change. \n\"The battlelines have been drawn — it's clear that the Coalition stands for cheaper energy,\" Mr Turnbull said. \n\"We are approaching this issue clear-eyed, pragmatic and objective.\" \nHe described the South Australia blackout as a \"wake-up call\" for the nation, claiming the state now has the most expensive and least secure energy. \nThe Prime Minister said coal would continue to play a role in Australia's energy mix for decades to come, while criticising state Labor governments' renewable energy targets. \nHe said his office had written to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to establish a new funding round for large scale energy storage projects, including pumped hydro. \n\"Large scale storage will support variable renewables like wind and solar, it will get more value out of existing baseload generation and it will enhance grid stability,\" he said. Turnbull calls for aggressive approach to trade \nThe Prime Minister also continued his attack on the Opposition by focusing on trade, maintaining he is committed to the principles of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, despite the withdrawal of the US. \n\"We cannot retreat into the bleak dead end of protectionism,\" he said. \n\"We must compete aggressively to export our services in education, health, engineering, tourism and more, and we must pursue even greater access for our agriculture and manufactures.\" \nMr Turnbull said export trade deals were expanding opportunities for Australian businesses, and criticised \"political opportunists\" for calling on the Government to turn inward and restrict investment. \n\"They are doing nothing more than playing on the fears and hardships of those in the community who feel they have not shared in the benefits of globalisation and technological change,\" Mr Turnbull said. \nMr Turnbull said the public expect the Government to ensure only Australians can influence elections, potentially flagging changes to foreign donation laws or more stringent cyber security measures.
