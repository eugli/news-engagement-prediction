Srijani Ganguly / Mail Today | Posted By Disha Roy Choudhury A + A - Sarthak Sardana a.k.a. Sartek has a lot in store for his fans this year. Photo: Mail Today \nA number of DJs have emerged from India in the past few years, but very few have created their own radio show with the aim to promote new talent. Sarthak Sardana a.k.a. Sartek, whose own career is skyrocketing, uses the means of his soundcloud page to provide a platform for undiscovered talent. \nHe explains, \"Once a month I do a post on my Facebook page asking for new demos from producers all across India. Then I feature one each month on the show ('back to the Future'), so that the respective producer benefits from the radio play. I try to play tracks which sound unique and professionally produced so the producer gets noticed among my fans and other listeners.\" \nApart from his monthly show, there's a lot on Sartek's plate. \"My 'Jump Right After You' tour is set for February and March with back to back gigs! I'm touring every major city in the country, from college campuses and festivals to clubs. I'm really kicked about it,\" he says. \nAlso Read:Meet the DJ who got to close David Guetta's Mumbai concert \nHe is also working on a track with a \"legendary Dutch DJ\". Other than that, he adds, \"I'm doing a special panel at ADE Mumbai to help upcoming producers from across the country. Also, I feel honoured that the team at TEDX asked me to come speak at their panel, it was a good experience.\" \nLooking back, Sartek says that his overall experience has been pretty good. \"2016 has been the best year career wise,\" he says, adding, \"I released five tracks on A-class labels such as Armada, Showland and Revealed, and collaborated on two tracks with upcoming Indian producers meanwhile doing a mad bunch of shows, all throughout. Opening for Hardwell in Delhi and finally getting to know that I'll be working with Sony Music Worldwide's Discowax label was the highlight of the year!\" To get the latest entertainment news and gossip, follow us on Twitter @Showbiz_IT and Like us on facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
