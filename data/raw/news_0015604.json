That’s because he was there, just one week ago, doing his legendary impression of President Donald Trump . But, this weekend he’s hosting for a record 17th time, and so in the promo, he goes on a walk down memory lane. He opens the video saying, “This was my home. This was my heartbeat. It feels like so many lifetimes ago.” He remembers classic moments like “Schweddy Balls,” and hearing Don Pardo say “Ladies and gentlemen, Alec Baldwin!” \n“I must return,” he says. Then, it’s time to snap back to reality. Vanessa Bayer reminds him he’s there pretty much all the time. It’s going to be a good night, unless you’re Trump. He’s not exactly a fan of Baldwin’s work. \n[featured image via screen grab] \nHave a tip we should know?
