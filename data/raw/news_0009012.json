Nevertheless, Mayor Bowman remains open to the idea, and welcomes feedback and thoughts from the community about the need to undertake a declaration such as this.” © 2017 The Canadian Ptess ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:38:32.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
