The AHA concluded that the two scenes shown in the video were actually filmed at different times, the dog shown was never forced into the water, and that “a full spectrum of preparation and safety measures were in place.”\nMore from the AHA: At the same time, American Humane believes that the handling of the dog in the first scene in the video should have been gentler and signs of stress recognized earlier. That being said, it is important to note that this was recognized and the scene did not proceed as insinuated by the misleadingly edited video. Although the dog was momentarily stressed, based on studying additional footage not included in the video, body posture, and the fact that he quickly and willingly went into the water and performed the scene soon afterwards, a separate, independent, board certified Veterinary Behaviorist brought in to examine the events concluded that there was “no lasting stress response or conditioned fear of the water as a result.” Eyewitnesses also report that following the water scene, the dog was wagging his tail and wanted to go back into the water.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:02:16.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
