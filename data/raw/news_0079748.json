The top 10 of the new March 18, 2017-dated Billboard 200 chart (where HNDRXX may debut at No. 1) is scheduled to be revealed on Billboard’s websites on Sunday, March 5. \nIf HNDRXX bows at No. 1, it will land Future his fifth consecutive leader on the list, following Future , Evol , What a Time to Be Alive (with Drake ) and DS2 . \ns for the rest of the big debuts in next week’s top 10, watch for Little Big Town to notch the second-highest new entry with the group’s The Breaker .
