After The Miz failed to capture the title himself during the Elimination Chamber Match at SmackDown LIVE ‘s last exclusive PPV before WrestleMania , the feud he had with Intercontinental Champion Dean Ambrose and real-life girlfriend Renee Young seems to have come to a rather sudden, inconclusive end. While Ambrose begins a program with Baron Corbin, it looks like John Cena will once again take part in a mid-card match at WWE’s biggest show of the year. John Cena hasn’t been in a WrestleMania main event since facing The Rock in 2013. [Image by WWE] \nIf the John Cena/Nikki Bella vs. The Miz/Maryse rumors are true, that means Natalya, Becky Lynch, Mickie James and Alexa Bliss — not to mention Carmella or Eva Marie — could be the No. 1 contender for Naomi’s title by the time WrestleMania 33 rolls around. Some other WWE rumors suggest, however, that the SmackDown Women’s Championship won’t be defended at WrestleMania , and that there won’t be a single one-on-one match on the card from the women’s division of either brand (the same rumor-mill suggests that the Raw Women’s Championship will be defended in a Fatal 4-Way Match, including Bayley, Charlotte Flair, Sasha Banks and Nia Jax). Whatever the blue brand has planned for the rest of their Women’s Division at WrestleMania , the pieces will likely start falling into place on this week’s SmackDown LIVE . \nMeanwhile, many questions remain about what is really going on between Randy Orton and Bray Wyatt. As a loyal member of The Wyatt Family, Randy told Bray at the conclusion of last week’s SmackDown that he wouldn’t be challenging his leader for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania . Without any definite plans set for AJ Styles, could The Phenomenal One be pulled into the mix, making it a Triple Threat Match? \nOf course, the WWE Universe also expects American Alpha to defend the SmackDown Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania 33 , and it would appear that The Usos are next in line. At the same time, the red brand’s Cruiserweight Division shows off their talent on Tuesday nights as well with 205 Live on the WWE Network. Since Neville will be forced to put his belt on the line against Jack Gallagher at WWE Fastlane 2017 , it’s unclear who will be walking into WrestleMania 33 with the title, and who they’ll be defending it against. \nThe February 21 episode of SmackDown LIVE airs from the Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, California. The two-hour program will air live on the USA Network beginning at 8/7c. \nRELATED REPORTS BY THE INQUISITR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:46:16.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
