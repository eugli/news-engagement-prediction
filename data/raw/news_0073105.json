As long as there’s a source of blood available to them, they will happily take up residence in even the most pristine home. Bed bugs don’t care how much money you make. Being poor does not put you at greater risk of bed bugs, and having wealth does not immunize you. They hide wherever they can easily feed on blood and that is why they are brought into the house undetected through luggage, clothing, used beds and couches, and other items. UNILAG students protesting the infestation of their hostels by bedbugs and mosquitoes on 28/9/2015 \nTheir flattened bodies make it possible for them to fit into tiny spaces and they do not have nests like ants or bees, but tend to live in groups in hiding places. Their initial hiding places are typically in mattresses, box springs, couches, bed frames, and headboards where they have access to people to bite in the night. \nBedbugs irritate and can cause you embarrassment in the public and ignorant people will think your home is dirty just like a lady was embarrassed last week in Lagos in a commercial bus. Mopelola (not real name) was well dressed in her white top and grey trousers and sat quietly in the front seat with the driver. \nSuddenly a young man from behind jolted her that there was a brownish insect walking around her shirt’s collar. The good Samaritan helped Mopelola to pick the insect, killed it and, surprisingly, blood gushed out of the insect with the attendant foul smell. The young man shouted: ‘it’s bed bug, how come as beautiful as you are?’ All eyes were on this damsel. Ashamed, she quickly alighted at the next bus-stop. \nUnfortunately, for many people, there are many kinds of pests and insects that accompany them home and are prospering there. One of them is bedbug. It does not have wings and relies on humans to carry it from one place to another. It’s brown colour makes it very visible when having nice time on the host dress. Because it thrives only on the blood of warm-blooded animals, humans rank quite high on the list of the host. It’s most active at night, feeding on it’s victims while they sleep or watch television and, the next morning, they are left wondering why their bodies seriously itch. \nWhere you can contact bedbug Seating near someone that his or her cloth is carrying it Visiting houses infested with bedbugs. You don’t have to enter the bedroom. Just seating on a chair is enough. •Inside airplane while travelling and that is why your clothing must be properly zipped in your luggage bag. In hotel room, hostels and wearing other people’s clothes. \nHow to detect bed bug presence in your home \nThough, people sometimes mistake bedbugs for teak, you may not see them until they have invaded your bed, furniture and other items in the house. They make their presence felt by their bites. Most people do not remember having been bitten because it happens while they are asleep. \nTypical symptoms are: Itching with a burning sensation? Rashes on arms, face, legs or back Bites continuing in lines? \nNote that bedbugs do not cause any infection, but the bite itself can be pestering and painful. They can trigger allergic reactions and ramify skin infections. They also have a devastating socio-economic effect on residential and hotels infested by these troublesome insects. They can also adapt to temporary habitats like buses, trains, cars and travel luggage. \nIf you are unable to spot them but you are apprehensive that they are present in your home, look for the trails. Their droppings leave spots that are reddish brown just like their colour. The droppings may sometimes be in the form of tint bead. \nWhat brings bed bugs? \nMostly, they are not a sign of a filthy home or bad care. They are just natural companions of people. They can become invisible tour companions and can be carried from home to home in furniture, on clothes or even in home appliances. So, as home makers that want your home to be a good reflection of you, if you travel much or bring in used clothes into the home, make sure to wash them well in hot water and examine all the fixtures for these bugs. \nGetting rid of bugs \nGetting rid of bed bugs is not as easy as using a mosquito repellent. They have a resilience that is unrivalled and even if it’s just a few of them that survive; they are bound to multiply again sooner than you can expect. Discarding an entire lot of furniture altogether is not a solution, for the enemy may be hiding in your walls. So, you have to look for them first; make a strategy and then swing into action. Vacuum your upholstery, mattresses and furniture; wash your linen in disinfectants; and reach the corners of your house as well as all the furniture to kill them. Treatments that claim 100% eradication can be used but professional services that are expertise in this area can be consulted too. \nI believe getting 100% eradication as home makers depend on how proactive you are! The best solution is to prevent it from coming to your house by all means. adekunle ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:46:17.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
