He’s re-teaming with Margot Robbie who will reprise the role of Harley Quinn. We may know who’s playing the villain as well. Ayer just tweeted a picture of the DC Comics character Black Mask , though he didn’t include any text. The picture is from the comic “ Batman: Under the Red Hood .” Does this mean he’ll be in the film? \nRELATED: David Ayer and Margot Robbie are reteaming for a Gotham City Sirens movie! \nIf you’re not familiar with the character, Black Mask is the alter-ego of Roman Sionis. Sionis’ wealthy parents were contemporaries of Thomas and Martha Wayne, so he spent time with Bruce Wayne as a child. His parents were less concerned with bringing up him up than they were with their appearances. A series of accidents that harmed Sionis were covered up to preserve their reputation. He killed his parents and took over their cosmetics company. After a failed business venture deformed a number of women, Wayne offered to bail out the company, and Sionis resented him for it. He smashed his father’s casket in his parents’ crypt and carved himself a mask, taking on the persona of Black Mask. He became a crime lord, leads the criminal band called the False Face Society and is one of Batman’s enemies. Black Mask has appeared in the animated series The Batman , the animated film Batman: Under the Red Hood and the Batman: Arkham Asylum video game series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:14:42.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
