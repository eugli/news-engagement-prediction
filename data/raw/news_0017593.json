Olivia Colman is one big name to have recently become a favourite among the bookies to land the role of the 13th Doctor\nOther favourites with punters include Broadchurch actor Andrew Buchan, Game Of Thrones star Iwan Rheon, James Bond's Q Ben Whishaw and and The IT Crowd's Richard Ayoade.\nOlivia, who recently received an Emmy award nomination for her role in The Night Manager, has even been tipped for the job by her Broadchurch co-star David Tennant who played the tenth Doctor.\n'Olivia would clearly be a magnificent choice.

I can't praise the people I work with more highly.\n'I've never worked the same job for three years, and I feel like now is the right time to move on. I'll still be the Doctor for a while.'\nTwelve actors have played the time-travelling Doctor since William Hartnell first adopted the role in 1963, and so far all of them have been men.\nBillie Piper, who played the Doctor's assistant when the show was brought back in 2005, tweeted that it would be a 'welcome turn' for a woman to take the role.\nIt's a hit: Olivia recently won acclaim for her turn as Angela Burr on The Night Manager\nIn a statement, show boss Steven Moffatt, who is himself leaving at the end of Series 10 said: 'Like Peter, I'm facing up to leaving the best job I'll ever have, but knowing I do so in the company of the best, and kindest and cleverest of men, makes the saddest of endings a little sweeter.'\nBroadchurch's Chris Chibnall, who is taking over from Mr Moffatt, will be given the difficult choice of choosing the next Doctor.\nInsiders say it is likely he will choose someone younger who can recreate the popularity that came with David Tennant's era.\nSales of Dr Who merchandise have fallen in recent years, and producers are keen to boost the show's popularity with children.\nSome fans feared the regeneration into the 13th doctor could signal the end of the sci-fi show as a 1970s episode said there could only be 12 regenerations.\nOther choices: Bookmakers suggest that likely replacements include James Bond star Ben Whishaw (left) and The IT Crowd's Richard Ayoade (right)\nBut thankfully the writers dealt with the problem in the 2013 Christmas Special, when the Doctor played by Matt Smith used all his regenerations up trying to save Trenzalore, the planet it was foretold he would die on.\nAs his life was set to end, the Time Lords granted him a new generation cycle, allowing the Doctor to regenerate into the 12th Doctor, played by Capaldi.\nThe BBC confirmed there will definitely be another Doctor.\nSpeculation on who'll take the role is even rife among politicians, with former Deputy Labour MP Harriet Harman expressing hopes the Doctor should be a woman with a male assistant so she could 'tell him what to do'.\nBookie's choice: Andrew Buchan, who co-starred with Olivia in Broadchurch is also in the top ten list for the new Doctor\nBetting: Iwan Rheon, who recently played baddie Ramsay Snow in Game Of Thrones\nBut Theresa May – who has said she is a fan of the 54-year-old sci-fi show – has hit back, saying the sex of the Doctor was a matter for the programme-makers to decide.\n'Of course there should be a female Doctor Who but what we need is a man as her assistant,' she said. 'She has got to just tell him what to do, he will need that leadership.'\nBut the Prime Minister's spokeswoman said: 'As someone who has been clear she enjoys Doctor Who, I think she will just want to see it continue and continue to be entertaining. It's for the programme-makers to decide.'\nMrs May revealed her liking for Doctor in an interview with Radio Times about her Christmas Day TV viewing, in which she said: 'I always like to see Doctor Who on Christmas night, if possible.'\nWeighing in: Harriet Harman, Labour's former deputy leader and a prominent feminist, has suggested the BBC appoint a woman as the next Doctor Who", "external_links": ["http://www.dailystar.co.uk/", "https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/danny-dyer-should-be-the-next-doctor-who", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-09T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T06:29:22.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
