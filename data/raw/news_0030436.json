Evacuations ordered after Lake Oroville Dam uses emergency spillway \nL arge pieces of concrete were missing from the spillway, which helps to withhold hundreds of billions of gallons of water, making authorities fear a potential breach which could have created a 30-foot-high wave. \nTens of thousands of people have still not returned to their homes as engineers attempt to rectify the situation, ensuring that the flood risk will never resurface. Many local communities are like ghost towns. \nThe panic that ensued from the evacuation warnings led to roads becoming gridlocked as residents feared a potential catastrophe.
