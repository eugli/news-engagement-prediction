The waves turned the boat side-on so we tried to row hard to turn the boat around but we couldn’t do it.” \nCaptain Sarah Hornby, who turned 31 during the crossing, decided to deploy the “para anchor” on the Ellida, which keeps it steady in heavy seas. \nMs Charlton said: “You have to sit in two tiny cramped cabins and just wait it out. The worst thing was knowing that we were going in the wrong direction and we couldn’t do anything.” \nThe team landed safely in English Harbour, Antigua last week, after 55 days and 13 hours on the ocean. Ms Charlton and fellow rowers Ms Hornby, Charlotte Best, 30 and Kate Hallam, 33, were raising money for Mind UK and Women for Women International. \nMs Charlton said: “I have this memory of rowing at night with big waves coming in, it was quite scary. It was a baptism of fire for ocean rowing.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T16:15:42.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
