And yet, Bill Belichick passed up on an opportunity to end the game in an even more remarkable — and spectacularly bizarre — way, as only the Patriots coach could.\nAfter New England’s defense halted the Atlanta Falcons’ attempted last-minute drive, Julian Edelman fair caught a short punt from Matt Bosher on the Patriots’ own 35-yard line.\nWith just three seconds left in regulation, it set up an opportunity for one of most obscure plays in the NFL rulebook: The fair catch free kick . Given the Patriots coach’s affinity for the most esoteric rules and game scenarios, a Stephen Gostkowski game-winning free kick would have arguably been the most Belichickian ending to Super Bowl LI.\nSeveral observers on Twitter, including yours truly , detected the opportunity with glee:\nBILL BELICHICK THIS IS YOUR MOMENT\nDO THE FAIR CATCH KICK\n— Rodger Sherman (@rodger_sherman) February 6, 2017\nFREE KICK TIME\n— Andy Glockner (@AndyGlockner) February 6, 2017\nthe most perfect moment in NFL history for a fair catch free kick and they aren't gonna do it\n— Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) February 6, 2017\nInstead, the Patriots opted for a fake kneel play — a respectively weird call — which resulted in a 13-yard Dion Lewis run ( and injury ), sending the game into overtime.\nFor those not familiar with the little-known quirk, the fair catch free kick is a play teams can run only after making a fair catch. It allows the receiving team to effectively attempt a field goal from the spot of the catch, but in a kickoff-like format (i.e. the kicker can take a long run-up and the defense must stand ten yards back from the line of scrimmage).\nBut the defense also can catch and receive the kick if it comes up short, which it often does.\nThe most recent time the “buried” rule was seen in the NFL was a 71-yard attempt by San Francisco 49ers kicker Phil Dawson in 2013 . The last time it was tried in the playoffs was by 49ers kicker Mike Cofer in 1988 game, in which announcer John Madden presciently called the possibility.\nThere hasn’t been a successful NFL free kick in more than four decades (though the Green Packers’ Mason Crosby got close from 69 yards in 2008).\nIn Sunday night’s scenario, Gostowski would have been allowed to try a 75-yard attempt from same distance the he would take a kickoff. As former kicker Jay Feeley noted , it would certainly be a long attempt, but not unreachable for Gostowski. The Patriots kicker was tied for the most touchbacks in the league in 2015 , before the league changed its touchback rules .\nGostkowski has kicked off through the uprights many times from that exact spot\n— Jay Feely (@jayfeely) February 6, 2017\nAs rare as free kicks are in the league — there have only been four recorded attempts since 1984 — Belichick was of course keenly aware of the opportunity. In fact, the Patriots coach talked about the “unusual” rule last week, after the Dallas Cowboys passed up a free kick opportunity in an earlier playoff game.\n“Those kind of plays come up sometimes once in a career,” he told reporters in a press conference Wednesday, later adding, “Things like that that you don’t see or haven’t seen in a long time.”\nNevertheless, Belichick — a preparation maven and master of football’s obscurities — said the team regularly refreshes players and coaches of such chicanery, but noted how specific the situation must be to make a free kick a worthwhile strategy.\n“If you just add or subtract a second from the situation or add or subtract a few yards and put a timeout into that equation, with or without it, you get a pretty dramatic shift on what the strategy would be,” he said.\nAs Yahoo Sports reported, the only time Belichick was involved in a free kick was as a special teams coach in 1979 when the New York Giants kicker Mark Moseley tried a 74-yard attempt. It reportedly came up short.\nFor Belichick, the potential of Gostkowski coming up short and a big Falcons return was apparently too much of a risk Sunday night — as he told reporters after the game.\nBill Belichick confirms he wanted to go with the fair catch free kick but it was just too far.\n— Will Brinson (@WillBrinson) February 6, 2017\nOf course, the decision ultimately worked out for Belichick and the Patriots. And for fans of NFL weirdness, the fake kneel probably sufficed.", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_catch_kick", "https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/patriots/2016/09/15/stephen-gostkowski-kickoffs-were-shorter-and-sweeter/g1KlWi1yIX2Q7HcwurRTfL/story.html", "https://www.sportingcharts.com/nfl/stats/kickoff-return-yards/2015/", "https://theringer.com/best-moments-in-nfl-rulebook-loophole-history-harbaugh-belichick-81d22cbcaa36#.4ahq124ja", "https://twitter.com/jayfeely/status/828441645750198272", "https://twitter.com/rodger_sherman/status/828441502229618688", "http://sports.yahoo.com/news/how-bill-belichick-prepares-patriots-players-for-once-in-a-career-type-of-plays-215307295.html", "https://twitter.com/jayfeely/status/828442204980944896", "https://twitter.com/AndyGlockner/status/828441279331708928", "https://twitter.com/NikDeCostaKlipa/status/828441273849741313", "http://www.sbnation.com/2017/2/5/14518384/super-bowl-51-dion-lewis-injury-patriots-vs-falcons", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHdlA-l7Io", "http://www.sbnation.com/2017/1/15/14280472/cowboys-fair-catch-kick-points-packers-vs-cowboys", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/awJottxfqeg?feature=oembed", "http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000251221/Dawson-fair-catch-kick-attempt", "http://quirkyresearch.blogspot.com/2006/07/nfl-fair-catch-kick-attempts.html", "http://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/10/06/bill-belichick-patriots-nfl-rulebook/", "https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/828441486081548289", "https://twitter.com/WillBrinson/status/828459202637131776"], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:25:43.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
