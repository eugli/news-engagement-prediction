His journey sees him check-in, eat a sandwich and pass through security without interruption, which demonstrates how easy it is for the London-born TV host to leave the US. This message is highlighted at the end of the video.\n\"Today, James flew out of Los Angeles,\" it reads. \"So all our shows this week have been pre-taped. Freedom of movement should be this easy for all legal immigrants. Not just the white and Christian ones.\"\nCorden's powerful political statement comes after he showed his support for the people of Liverpool by tweeting a picture of the anti-Trump protests.\nProud of the people of Liverpool for this.

After the president signed an executive order that halts refugees from entering the US last Friday, a number of high-profile names have spoken out against the controversial ban.\nActress Kerry Washington said news of the ban made her \"sick to her stomach,\" while filmmaker Michael Moore apologized on behalf of America.\nSick to my stomach today about the #MuslimBan\nDon't understand why? Go to @Stl_Manifest & learn the awful history of US rejecting refugees\n— kerry washington (@kerrywashington) January 28, 2017 To our Muslim neighbors in the world: I & tens of millions of others are so very sorry. The majority of Americans did not vote 4 this man.\n— Michael Moore (@MMFlint) January 28, 2017 ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JKCorden/status/826224952923693056", "https://twitter.com/Stl_Manifest", "https://t.co/RRJeRNZ8iC", "https://twitter.com/kerrywashington/status/825449147436146688", "https://twitter.com/MMFlint/status/825229567778516992", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MuslimBan?src=hash"], "published": "2017-01-31T12:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:13:03.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
