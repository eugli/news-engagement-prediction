When a woman is pregnant, she wants the very best for her baby. And if you can form a therapeutic alliance with her at that moment of hope, there's a very real opportunity for her to change her life,\" said Hunt. \nPatients say the help they've received from the unit has been life-changing. \nJade was addicted early on in her pregnancy to crystal meth and living on Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. \n\"I am 100 per cent a different person,\" she said. \nJade's newborn Jacob is perfectly health, with no signs of any damage from his mother's earlier drug addiction. \nCanadian doctors say treating women by jailing them for their addictions only scares them. \n\"They are fearful of losing their children. Most women I work with want to parent and they feel really strongly about parenting,\" says Dr. Suzanne Turner, a family physician who runs a similar program at St. Michael's Hospital. \"They fear they may have their children taken away from them as a result of their illness.\" \nTurner, along with other Canadian doctors, is calling for an increase in the number of programs similar to Fir Square. \n\"We need to make sure in every community where there is a woman with an opioid addiction, we need to provide this very important care,\" she said. \nWith a report from CTV News' medical specialist Avis Favaro and producer Elizabeth St. Philip Related Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:13:59.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
