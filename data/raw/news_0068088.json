We even ate in there. PA Ahmad is one of the children helped by Adel and his Canadian best friend Elijah \n\"It was really hard finding food. We didn't have enough gas so it was hard to cook food properly so we had to leave.\" \nAhmad's family now live in a small flat in Bristol, spending most of their time in one room. \n\"We do everything in this room, we eat, drink, pray, sleep and play,\" Ahmad said. \nDuring his first few months in the UK, Ahmad stayed inside most of the time. \nHe struggled to make new friends because he spoke little English but felt more positive after Adel and Elijah took him on a bike tour of the city. PA During his first few months in the UK, Ahmad stayed inside most of the time \nAdel and Elijah also help Negervan, 12, and his brother Haider, 10, who are haunted by memories from Syria of people being killed and homes being destroyed. \n\"There's a boy at school who tells me, 'Go back to Syria', and I said, 'If I do I'll be killed',\" Haider said. \nThe family came to the UK \"to be happy\" but the boys found it hard to make friends until Adel and Elijah took them to a community art workshop. \nCBBC controller Cheryl Taylor said: \"CBBC aims to reflect the lives of all children on our channel.
