Miller - The Washington Times - Updated: 8:36 p.m. on Tuesday, January 31, 2017 \nIn one of the most hotly anticipated political announcements in years, President Trump on Tuesday named Neil Gorsuch as his nominees for the Supreme Court. \nHe said he was keeping his promise to the American people to nominate the “best judge” in the country. \n“Today I am keeping another promise to the American people,” the president in the East Room of the White House as he introduced Judge Gorsuch, a widely respected jurist who currently serves on the U.S. appeals court based in Denver. \nSEE ALSO: Conservative legal scholars call Trump pick Gorsuch an ideal Scalia replacement \nThe pick immediately drew praise from conservatives, including an outpouring of support from Senate Republicans. \nBut Judge Gorsuch also quickly found detractors among liberal groups that raised concerns about his stance on gun control and the role of big money in politics. \nThe nomination appeared headed for a battle royal in the Senate, where some Democrats vowed to block the nomination even before Mr. Trump announced his pick. \n“You’ve trusted me with a most solemn assignment,” Judge Grouch said to the president. \nThe judge pledge that, if confirmed, he would labor to live up to the stand set by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose vacancy he was tapped to fill. \n“Justice Scalia was a lion of the law. Agree or disagree with him, all of his colleagues on the bench shared his wisdom and his humor. And like them, I miss him,” said Judge Grouch. \nThe nomination fulfilled a big campaign promise for Mr. Trump, whose pledge to put a conservative justice on the high court helped galvanize support from conservative voters leery of the New York billionaire who unexpectedly capture the GOP nomination for president. \nTo solidify conservative support, Mr. Trump took the unusual step of promising to make his pick from a list of 21 jurists who had the stamp of approval form conservative leaders. \nJudge Gorsuch was on the list. \nMr. Trump gave a nod to the importance voters placed on his pick for the high court. \n“Millions of voters said this was the single most important issue to them when they voted for me,” said the president. “I am a man of my word. I will do what I say, something that people have been asking for form Washington for a very long time.” \nWhomever fills the vacancy created by death last February of Scalia, who was one of the Supreme Court’s strongest conservative voices, has the potential to alter the balance of the court. That gave Republicans another reason — and for some the only reason — to rally behind Mr. Trump in hopes of preventing a pick by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton from tiling the high court to the left for a generation. \nExit polls showed that 70 percent of voters in the presidential election said the Supreme Court pick was an important factor in their decision. Of the 21 percent who cited it as the “most important” issue in the presidential election, 57 percent voted for Mr. Trump and 40 percent for Mrs. Clinton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:42:00.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
