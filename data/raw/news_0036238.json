Credit Toronto Star Stuart McLean, a Canadian journalist who found fame on the radio as a gentle and optimistic humorist, died on Wednesday in Toronto. He was 68. His death was announced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , which broadcast Mr. McLean’s reports on its radio and television networks as well as his long-running weekly variety radio show, “The Vinyl Cafe.” The show was also heard on 62 public radio stations in the United States and, until 2008, on BBC Radio. Mr. McLean announced in December 2015 that he was suspending the show to concentrate on his treatment for melanoma; the CBC gave no cause of death. It was Mr. McLean’s focus on small, quotidian events in his later work as a journalist that led him toward writing fictional tales about the owner of a secondhand record shop, known only as Dave, and his family and neighbors. They became the heart of “The Vinyl Cafe.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The program rested almost entirely on Mr. McLean’s slow-paced storytelling. He read essays about the various communities where the show was recorded along with his fictional tales of Dave’s life. In between, he spotlighted live and recorded music performances by Canadian artists, most of them young and little-known folk or acoustic musicians. For many of its fans, the program helped define Canada. The show was first broadcast in 1994 as a summer replacement; when production was halted in late 2015 because of Mr. McLean’s cancer diagnosis, it went into reruns. The 11 books of stories from the program were all best sellers in Canada, and several won awards. Vinyl records, the product sold by Dave, the protagonist of most of the stories, already appeared headed for extinction when the show made its debut. While well intentioned, Dave was generally misguided and bumbling — a gentle, anger-free version of John Cleese’s Basil Fawlty. Morley, Dave’s wife, was the sensible family member. Like the characters’ family names, the location of the stories was never revealed, but, at least in the early seasons, it appeared to be Toronto. The definitive Dave-and-Morley story was first broadcast in 1996 and then every year after that, near Christmas. Its somewhat complex story line eventually finds Dave, tipsy, checking into a hotel on Christmas Day with his family’s uncooked holiday turkey under his arm. As always with Mr. McLean’s stories, all ends well. Jess Milton, the show’s producer for the last 13 years, said that while Mr. McLean regarded his essays as journalism and did extensive reporting before writing them, he was also comfortable with fanciful fiction.
