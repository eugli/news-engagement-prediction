Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, during his time on the bench in Colorado.\nLast year conservative, pro-life activist Andy Schlafly said that Gorsuch would probably not be as pro-life as he wants because he had avoided using the term “unborn child” in his opinions.\nHe also states that the potential justice is Episcopalian, and that the Episcopal Church is not as vocally anti-abortion as many other denominations.\nHowever, other conservative writers have praised Gorsuch for wanting to review an injunction granted to Planned Parenthood when Utah tried to stop it from receiving federal funds through the state.\nGorusch has also written a book where he opposes assisted suicide and euthanasia.\nBeyond abortion, one of his highest profile cases, Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius, centered on access to contraception and plaintiffs’ religious views.\nThe case, where Gorsuch sided with Hobby Lobby, eventually went to the Supreme Court and ruled that businesses should not be mandated to provide contraceptive insurance coverage for employees if the owners decided it violated their freedom of religion.\nGun rights: \nThe nominee does also not have a record of directly ruling on hot-button gun legislation such as firearm bans.\nBut his adherence to a “texualist” reading of the Constitution did lead to a gun-related opinion in a 2012 case about whether a felon had to know about his conviction in order to be prosecuted for having a firearm.\nGorsuch asked the court to review its decision saying that it was, leading legal observers at SCOTUS blog to say that, similar to Scalia, that he may down on the side of criminal defendants and their rights.\nLegalized marijuana: \nGorsuch’s position in Denver also means that he was one of the first federal judges to rule on issues regarding legalized marijuana.\nA Colorado dispensary was made by the IRS to pay taxes on “business expenses” that they took off, and said that they should not have to disclose the nature of their business to authorities for fear of self-incriminating, according to Courthouse News.\nGorsuch and fellow judges denied the dispensary’s motion in 2015, though the judge was sympathetic.\nHis opinion focused on the Obama administration as a center of the problems, saying confusion stemmed from the Justice Department saying it would not prosecute\nTrump’s administration is expected to take a tougher stance on local marijuana laws under possible Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has called the drug “a very real dangers” and “not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized.”\nTags: donald trump supreme court donald trump first 100 days neil gorsuch immigration abortion gun control marijuana  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:35:18.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
