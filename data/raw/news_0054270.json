Chief Izuwa Nwogu being capped by Eze C.C Alozie (left picture) & Izuwa being advised by another monarch after his conferment \nOn hand to help Eze Alozie confer on Kelly Nwogu title of Ihe Omoba, meaning the light of Omoba community, were seven other traditional rulers in the Kingdom and environs, including Ezes Godwin Ogbonna, T. N. Adiele, J. I. Emele, F. E. Nwoko, F. O. Amanze, G. N. Nwankpa and F. U. Uka. \nEze Alozie said the chieftaincy conferred on Kelly Nwogu was to spur him to do more and have greater interest in the development of the area, particularly Omoba Kingdom. \nCapping and decorating Izuwa with the title, Eze Alozie charged him to bring more of his investment to the community in order to provide jobs for the Omoba youths and uplift the status of the community, assuring him of the cooperation of the communities in terms of the enabling environment such as provision of land. \nAddressing the monarchs and other high chiefs present at the ceremony, Chief Izuwa Nwogu thanked them for the honour and assured them of his willingness to do more for the good of the area, saying that he was very much concerned about the development of the area. \n“I will continue to ensure that the development of Omoba remains my major focus; I will do my best to ensure that youths are empowered. And I will also do my best to partner my people in Government to develop our land”, Nwogu promised. \nHe has also hinted of his immediate plan to train 40, 000 Abia youths in various skills to enable them earn a decent living. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:08:11.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
