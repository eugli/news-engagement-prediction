Sacramento has agreed to trade DeMarcus Cousins to the New Orleans Pelicans, league source tells @TheVertical . — Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) February 20, 2017 Deal with the Pels includes guard Buddy Hield, and a 2017 first-round pick to the Kings for Cousins, league sources tell @TheVertical . — Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) February 20, 2017 Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway and a future first- and second-round to Sacramento for DeMarcus Cousins, league sources say — Marc Stein (@ESPNSteinLine) February 20, 2017 \nCousins now unites with fellow former Kentucky Wildcat Anthony Davis in New Orleans to form a combination of two of the top five players in the NBA . This is an absolute fleecing, as the picks are likely to vanish in value with Cousins and the Brow together. The Pelicans did not have to surrender star guard Jrue Holiday, any of their big men or talented wings like E’Twuan Moore. The Kings have gone from being sure of re-signing Cousins to a $200 million extension next summer to getting Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans’ expiring contract, Langston Galloway and a pick. \nMuch, much more to come on this shocking deal.
