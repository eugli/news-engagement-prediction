Ross, 78, made a fortune restructuring failed companies in the manufacturing and steel industries, among others, earning him the moniker, the “King of Bankruptcy.” Prior to his nomination by President Donald Trump, he worked as chairman and chief strategist of the equity firm W.L. Ross and Co. Ross is hailed as a hero by some for saving failing industries but critics have likened the business practice to being a \"vulture investor,\" though Ross himself disdains the term, according to a 2004 New York Magazine profile , which also noted that he prefers the description “a phoenix that rebuilds itself from the ashes.” Here's what you need to know about Ross: Name and Age: Wilbur Ross Jr., 78 Party: Ross was a noted donor to Republicans during this election cycle. However, Ross was a registered Democrat in the 1990s. Hometown: Weehawken, New Jersey What He Did Before Nomination: Chairman and chief strategist of private equity firm W.L. Ross and Co.

The casino closed in October of this year after enduring years of losses.** History Regarding 2016 Election/Trump Support: Ross said in March of 2016 that he was planning to vote for Donald Trump. \"I think the reason why the Trump phenomenon has become so important ... is because middle-class and lower-middle-class America has not really benefited by the last 10 to 15 years of economic activity and they're sick and tired of it and they want something different,\" Ross told CNBC at the time. He went on to become a close economic adviser to Trump through his presidential campaign and a public advocate for him in business circles.

The company paid the fine “without admitting or denying the findings,\" according to the SEC.** **In 2014, Ross told Bloomberg TV he believed the top 1 percent of wealthiest individuals in the country were \"being picked on for political purposes\" when asked about real estate magnate Sam Zell ’s comments that the 1 percent \"should be emulated.\"** ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T11:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:05:35.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
