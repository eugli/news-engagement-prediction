When preparing for a clip to run of her for the show, footage of a classic Caesar, Winans and Whitney Houston performance was used, and Winans was mistakenly shown.\nEhrlich said he usually checks such footage but didn't get a chance to this year, since he was busy with the show and the Recording Academy's tribute to the Bee Gees, which taped in Los Angeles on Tuesday and will air at a later date.\n\"We obviously want to apologize to Shirley Caesar,\" he said. \"It's unfortunate that happened.\"\nEhrlich was also frustrated that the mistakes have overshadowed some of the great performances that occurred on the show, including Beyonce, Bruno Mars and Adele, who had her own hiccup when she restarted her tribute to George Michael.\n\"When you do a three-and-a-half hour live show, it's fraught with danger,\" he said. \"It was an adventurous show in many ways.\"\nEhrlich has produced the Grammys for years and has also produced other events, including the Emmy Awards.\nRelated Stories Adele wins top Grammys, but pays tribute to Beyonce Highlights from Grammy Awards: Adele wins album of the year 'Still chasing something:' Metallica's Hetfield on the pursuit of the ultimate song", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:03:55.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
