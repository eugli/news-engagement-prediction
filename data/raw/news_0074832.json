Highlights St Stephen's administration has decided to go autonomous. 2 This decision has attracted a lot of flak from both students and teachers. 3 The campus is witnessing protests by students and teachers, calling the decision autocratic. \nDespite facing opposition from students and teachers, St. Stephen's decided to go ahead with autonomy. \nThe decision was announced after the college governing body met on Saturday. Mail Today had first reported the move on Saturday. St. Stephen's principal John Varghese said, \"We are on our way to attain autonomy and are in the process of applying for it as a constituent college of the University of Delhi.\" \nHe quickly downplayed fears of a fee hike. \"The issue of self-financing is not immediate,\" he told this reporter. \"Students are agitated because they are not aware of the proceedings. We will ensure that autonomy does not have any adverse impact on the present set of students and they will be consulted.\" \nWHAT NEXT? \nThe governing body meeting continued even as students protested on the campus demanding participation. Many say the 'principal is unwilling to participate in a democratic process'. \n\"We want a democratic discourse. We will continue to protest without disrupting academic proceedings against the hurried manner in which the decision has been taken despite our objections,\" said a protestor. \"We also signed a petition urging the deferment of the governing body meeting until consensus is reached among students, faculty, and non-teaching staff,\" the protestor added. \n\"We are not going to meekly accept a decision that completely changes the very nature of the college without being given a say in it, especially when this crucial decision is taken only by a handful of people sitting at the top,\" he further said. \nAN AUTONOMOUS DECISION, NOT ACCEPTABLE \nDUTA president Nandita Narain said. \"The move reeks of autonomy for management, and not for teachers. Not only will autonomy take away the protective umbrella of DU safeguarding professor's rights, but it will invite autocracy and privatisation, bringing the prestige and ranking of St. Stephen's down.\" \n\"Our biggest fear after today's meeting remains about the quality of courses and the ranking expected to be compromised. We are fully funded as of now, but the principal has not guaranteed in writing that the fees will not be hiked in future,\" Narain added. \nShe said the decision was opposed by four members of the governing body and had an approval from 10 members, out of whom eight do not have an academic background. \"Out of two university representatives of the governing body, one called the meeting illegal saying he came to know of the decision through media reports,\" Narain said, adding that UGC guidelines cite consultation with stakeholders a mandatory protocol, which is not mentioned by the principal in his statement.
