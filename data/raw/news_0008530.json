Could   \nA armed robber captured a prison worker and stole a ladder to scale an 18ft wall and escape from jail. \nDean Walker, 33, from Crumpsall , locked horticultural instructor Joseph Watson in a concrete shed and stole his keys and utility belt in his bid to flee remote HMP Haverigg in Cumbria. \nAs terrified Mr Watson - who has a heart condition - shouted for help he spotted Walker dangling from the razor wire at the top of the fence by his clothing. \nBut Walker wriggled free and fled the Category C prison - and was found three days later in his home city of Manchester. \nJudge Philip Parry sentenced Walker to six years behind bars to run consecutively to the 11 year sentence he is serving for armed robbery. \nIn May 2016 he was branded a dangerous offender and jailed for a string of robberies, including one in which a woman was “dragged around like a ragdoll” at knifepoint at her workplace in Bolton. \nBut just five months into his sentence, Walker, of Cleveland Road, launched his bid for freedom.

The memory unsettles me.” \nWhen asked why he had committed the offences, Walker told his lawyer “it was just a stupid thing to do.” The remote HMP Haverigg on the Cumbrian coast (Photo: Google) Read More Demolition boss put workers and residents at risk of ‘serious harm’ by exposing them to asbestos \nHe pleaded guilty to false imprisonment, escape from lawful custody and theft. \nJudge Parry, sentencing, said: “You were a dangerous offender at large for three days before you were apprehended in Manchester, many miles away from where you were. \n“The public would have been aware that a dangerous knife wielding offender like you was at large in their area.This took concerted planning and was well executed. \n“It required and resulted in the false imprisonment of a civilian instructor who was in poor health. \n“Escapes from the prison estate are always very serious offences, indeed so are false imprisonments.” \nSpeaking after the sentence, Det Insp Adrian Johnson of Cumbria Constabulary said: “Cumbria Police Officers worked closely with our colleagues from Greater Manchester Police and North West Regional Organised Crime Unit (TITAN) to capture Mr Walker in the Gorton area of Manchester area. \n“This was an intelligence led operation, the priority at all times being to make sure that members of the public were kept from harm and today’s sentence reflects the gravity of Mr Walker’s actions.” \nTony Corcoran, HMP Haverigg Governor, said: “Approximately 40 additional staff from various prison establishments in the North West, as well as off duty Haverigg staff, were called in to assist with the incident. I am grateful for the assistance given to us by the Police, Ambulance and the Fire Brigade services who were employed throughout the incident on both days.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T17:03:48.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
