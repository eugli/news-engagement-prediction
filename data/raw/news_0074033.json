The GHMC has, through a survey, gathered data on the latitude and longitude of toilets and have them geo - tagged.\nIt has approached Google to ingest the toilet location on Google maps. This, however, awaits approval from the Union urban development ministry. Once the letter is approved, it would take no more than a week for citizens to locate a toilet in close vicinity with help from the App.\nAn official from the GHMC IT wing said, “It may be called ‘Swachh Bharat Toilet locator App’. The data will be live once the logins are done by the department under the Union ministry. GHMC has already moved the Centre seeking approval for ingesting the location of toilets on Google maps. After this, the data will be made live within a week.”\nAnother tab-based application is under way. This is to identify encroachments. GHMC, along with a city traffic team, developed a ‘Traffic e- Encroachment App (under trail) for booking encroachment cases under the GHMC act and for levy of fines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T10:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:02:35.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
