Such a loving selfie, isn’t it? Reminds us how even Arbaaz had clarified in his recent interview on how he’s going to continue maintaining good terms with Malaika’s family, irrespective of what’s their relationship status right now. He said, “Just because we’re separating, doesn’t mean we have to be worried about each other’s equations. I have a child with her, so we have to have a cordial and a great relationship. We’re very amicable with the split we had. I’m close to her side of the family, something that you can all see. My association with her family has been that of over 21 years, which is almost like a lifetime. I have a growing up child, so there’s a lot of parenting responsibilities and duties we have to do and it can only happen if the atmosphere between the two of us is very conducive and normal. We both are extremely mature and can handle this.” A post shared by Amrita Arora (@amuaroraofficial) on Feb 21, 2017 at 7:44pm PST \nGuess that explains it all, isn’t it?
