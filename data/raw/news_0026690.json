ET has learned that the 74-year-old actor flew over an American Airlines 737 with 110 passengers on board while attempting to land his plane at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, landing on the taxiway instead of the runway. WATCH: Harrison Ford Recovering After Crash A Federal Aviation Administration spokesperson confirmed the incident to ET, explaining that \"air traffic controllers cleared he pilot of a single-engine Aviat Husky to land on Runway 20L at John Wayne Airport Monday afternoon. The pilot correctly read back the clearance. The pilot then landed on a taxiway that runs parallel to the runway, overflying a Boeing 737 that was holding short of the runway.\" The FAA is currently investigating the incident, which could potentially lead to Ford losing his pilot license. \"Any pilot who violates FAA regulations can face penalties ranging from a warning letter to a license suspension or revocation,\" the FAA spokesperson tells ET. A National Transportation Safety Board spokesperson tells ET they are aware of the incident and are currently gathering information. There's no further comment at this time. Ford was photographed performing a serious check of his Aviat plane on Monday, before taking off from Santa Monica Airport, where the actor keeps an impressive collection of vintage planes.

This isn't the first time the Star Wars star has narrowly avoided a collision. In 2015, Ford crashed his World War II-era single-engine plane at a golf course in Venice, California, about 1,000 feet from the runway at Santa Monica Airport, where he initially took off. The actor suffered from amnesia after the crash, recalling that he was out for five days during his hospitalization. He also crash-landed a small plane in Nebraska in 2000. Reporting by Brendon Geoffrion. Ford opened up about his passion for flying in an ET interview in 1999. \"You just forewarn yourself against the potential, which is always there, for an accident,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:46:32.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
