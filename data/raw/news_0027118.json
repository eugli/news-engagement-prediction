Eric Larose of the Codiac RCMP said the cause remains under investigation.\n\"At this time because of what happened in three different buildings, we can consider that as suspicious,\" he said.\nLarose said no one was injured in the fire.\nCodiac RCMP and fire investigators continue to investigate the fire at three abandoned houses in Moncton. (Submitted by Wade Perry)\nAll three houses were on fire when crews from the Moncton Fire Department arrived, according to Platoon chief Dennis Dollemont.\n\"The middle house was completely engulfed in flames upon arrival so firefighters went into a defensive action immediately to protect the exposures - the outside two houses and the house in back of the middle house.\"\nDollemont said four stations were on scene with 19 firefighters working to battle the flames and they remained on scene for six hours.\nPictures show one of the three houses was reduced to rubble and the other two were extensively damaged by the fires.\nLarose said investigators will be working closely with the fire marshal's office and investigators from the fire department to determine the cause.\n\"Our general investigations section is going to take over today, we have specialized investigators for that,\" he said.\nPolice remained at the scene of the fires Sunday morning, directing traffic and onlookers away from the affected area.\nWith files from Blair Sanderson", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T20:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:30:52.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
