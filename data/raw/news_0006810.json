Now, Rose tells Cosmopolitan’s Laurie Sandell that speaking out about equality and LGBTQ rights are issues close to her heart. \n“There are things that I’m always going to be very vocal about, like LGBTQ and animal rights,” the star told Cosmopolitan . “I have a platform and I can open up a dialogue, but I also know that I’m just an actor. I’m just another person with an opinion no better than anyone else’s opinion. I don’t overanalyze. I just write from the heart, post it, and hope for the best. Then I move on.” Cosmopolitan \nRose has also been linked to a number of different stars throughout her time in the spotlight, something she jokes about with Cosmopolitan when discussing her thoughts on marriage. \n“According to the news, I’ve been engaged five times,” she quips . “For me, marriage is more about equal rights than the act of getting married. When you don’t have equal rights, it trickles down to kids who think, My aunt’s gay so she can’t get married, or I’m weird because I feel the same way. So it’s important to break down that barrier. I’m more interested in having a loving, healthy, long-term relationship with someone I might want to have kids with someday.” Cosmopolitan \nRose also opens up about being in touch with her own sexuality and the way that frames her own experiences as shenavigates the world. \n“I’m very confident and in tune with my sexuality,” she continues . “I feel very blessed for that, because in different places around the world, people can’t be. I’m lucky I can explore. I have a very healthy sex life, and there’s something very empowering, strong, and feminist about being open and comfortable in that world.” \nRose is slated to appear on the fifth season of “Orange Is The New Black,” premiering on Netflix this summer and taking place over the course of three days. \nHead here to check out Rose’s Cosmopolitan interview in full.
