Source: Supplied \nUnknown to the 2000 citizens of the town in a fertile valley amid the southwestern slopes of NSW, the dark family secret of multi-generational incest began to unravel in 2012. \nFour generations of intimate relations among the Colts had taken place in South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia and finally come to NSW. \nMoving state to state, possibly to evade detection, the family came to notice when authorities were alerted there were children living in the hills who didn’t attend school. \nThen one of the children who was attending Boorowa primary school was overhead saying “my sister is pregnant and we don’t know which of my brothers is the father”. \nIn July 2012, Boorowa farmers watched a convoy of police in four-wheel drives, a police bus and an ambulance drive up an old stock route to a remote bush block in the untamed scrub of old bushranger territory. \nWhat they discovered on the Colt family farm wouldn’t soon be forgotten. Thirty-eight adults and children were found living in two filthy caravans, two decrepit sheds and tents without electricity, running water or a toilet. Picture: News Corp.

Picture: News Corp.   \nIn a clearing in the woods, they found 38 adults and children living in two filthy caravans, two decrepit sheds and several tents without electricity, running water or a toilet. \nDirt caked the surfaces of stoves and cooking facilities, rotten vegetables lay in a refrigerator and a kangaroo was sleeping on one of the children’s beds. \nThe children were unwashed and wore dirty clothes, and were shy and made little eye contact. \nSome had oddly-formed features, which scientific tests would later reveal was a result of “homozygosity” or identical gene patterns of both of the children’s parents. \nFor the posse of authorities who had ridden onto the farm, it was a social time bomb exploding before their eyes. \nAs one police officer later reportedly told her colleagues, she would never get over it. \nRaylene, who is named in the new AVO, had a daughter Kimberly who at the age of 13 was \nunderweight, unable to clean her teeth, use toilet paper or comb her hair. \nLike most of the other children, she had fungal infections in her toenails that were so bad she required urgent podiatry. \nShe also needed urgent dental work for cavities and gingivitis.

Picture: News Corp.   \nThe other children had eye, dental and fungal infections. One 15-year-old soiled himself, wet his bed and had the skills of a kindergarten pupil. \nThe children allegedly tortured puppies and cats on the farm and mutilated their genitals. \nKimberly revealed to social workers and others that she had “sucked Dwayne”, her mother Raylene’s younger brother. \nLike 14 children found both on the farm and at at a carvan park in Victoria, Dwayne is the product of two closely related members of the Colt family. \nThree of the girls aged seven, eight and nine claimed that their uncle, Charlie Colt, was also their father. The nine year-old also claimed Charlie Colt had sex with her. \nThe Children's Court removed the children from their four mothers, Betty who was then aged 46, Rhonda, 47, Martha, 33, and Raylene, Betty’s 30-year-old daughter and the mother of Kimberly. \nThe property has been since sold to an owner who has nothing to do with the Colt family. \nNSW Children’s Court president Judge Peter Johnstone then took the rare step of publishing its ruling, changing the names of each family member to protect the children’s identities. \nThe women claimed outsiders had fathered their children — a fruit picker from South Australia, a wheat worker and a Swedish backpacker. But DNA tests told otherwise. \nThe children would reveal that Martha Colt and her brother Charlie slept together in one of the tents every night.

Eleven of the children living in tents (above) and filthy sheds on the Colt incest family farm were found to have interrelated parents. Picture: News Corp.   \nKimberly also told NSW Community Services that Dwayne and his brother Bobby had put their “dicks in her mouth” a number of times. \nDwayne and Bobby are the sons of Betty Colt, the family matriarch who was jailed in 2014 for plotting to kidnap two of her sons back from foster carers. \nDwayne told case workers that he had sex with his sisters and that he was told to keep secret the fact that his father was also his grandfather (Betty Colt’s late father, Tim). \nApart from being the victim of sexual abuse by uncles and other relatives on the farm, Kimberly was also an instigator. \nIn foster care, Kimberly was observed placing her hand inside the skirt of her aunty Carmen — who is five years younger than Kimberly. \nCarmen confirmed to a carer that Kimberly had been touching her “girl”, the words the Colt children used for “vagina”. \nJudge Johnstone’s findings stated that when “questioned about this behaviour, Kimberly reportedly stated, with a smile, that she engages in such behaviour because ‘she likes it’.” \nKimberly said her uncles tied her to a tree on the Colt property and had sex with her. Betty Colt, under arrest at Moss Vale court before going to prison, was given a 12-month sentence for trying to kidnap two of her sons who are the product of incestuous relationships.

Picture: News Corp.   \nHer mother Raylene did nothing about the regular sexual assault inflicted on her by her uncles. \nKimberly also stated that Dwayne had intercourse with her and “made me sore because he was too hard”. \nShe also told caseworkers that her uncle Joe “had sex with me only once” and told her not to tell anyone. \nBut she said that when she told her mother Raylene about these incidents, Raylene became angry and told her it was her fault and that she should not have sex with the boys who were “too big”. \nRaylene would later submit through her lawyer in the Children’s Court that she had not been informed of the abuse. \nRaylene’s lawyer also argued that Kimberly “suffers from an extremely low level of intelligence and is easily confused” and was “difficult to understand”. \nJudge Johnstone concluded that Kimberly was “the daughter of related parents ... either half siblings, uncle/niece, aunt/nephew, double first cousins or grandparent/grandchild”. \n“It follows that the assertion of Raylene Colt that Kimberly’s father was a man called Sven, a backpacker from Sweden or Switzerland, is wrong,” Judge Johnstone said. \n“The true father of Kimberly is someone from the Colt family. \n“I am satisfied, therefore, that Raylene Colt engaged in consanguineous, incestuous sexual relations within the Colt family group.” Police are to serve an Apprehended Violence Order against Charlie Colt, a member of the Colt incest family on behalf of his niece.
