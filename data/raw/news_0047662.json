He had deactivated his Facebook account sometime back and he now uses the time saved to play video games and football. “I love playing football myself and also the FIFA games on my computer. I also manage to play guitar,” he told HT. \nThe 21-year-old who bagged a Rs1.25 crore offer from Uber Technologies says he has not planned his future, but wants to travel extensively. \n“I will move to San Francisco, US, by October, if everything goes well with the visa procedure. If there is a delay, then I will join the Uber office in Bangalore,” said Sidharth, who had earlier done a seven-week internship with Uber. “There are lot of experts there so I am hoping to learn a lot and do some good work,” said Sidharth. However, his immediate plan after landing at San Francisco is to eat a burrito — a popular Mexican wrap. \nSidharth, who takes interest in operating systems, was also part of the team that designed DTU maps. He is only the second student from DTU to have received such a big offer in campus placements. In 2015, software giant Google had hired a student for an annual salary of Rs 1.27 crore.
