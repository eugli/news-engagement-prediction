There are people already waiting in the wings and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) will ginger them up.” Punjab Congress chief and former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh delivered this warning at the launch of his biography, ‘The People’s Maharaja’, written by Khushwant Singh. \nThe event was attended by the who’s who of the region, including Amarinder’s close friend Aroosa Alam from Pakistan. \nAmarinder cautioned that 10 lakh acres will go dry in southern Punjab if the canal is dug up.“Six lakh families will have to go without food. Do you think people will sit back? The youth will draw weapons,” he said. \nIn a free-wheeling interaction moderated by Hindustan Times senior resident editor Ramesh Vinayak, Amarinder said that the ruling SAD-BJP Government had not pursued the case well. “They should have at least told the court about the quantum of water available in the state. I can’t accept the ruling at all,” he said, telling how he had circumvented the canal during his tenure as chief minister. \n“I asked the secretary, irrigation, how we could avoid it, and he said there is a way but you might get sacked,” Amarinder recalled, while narrating the sequence of events that led to the Bill terminating all water agreements. \nCongress president Sonia Gandhi was so miffed with him that she refused to meet him for six months. \nTHE 1984 CHAPTER \nDwelling on the run-up to Operation Bluetsar, Amarinder recounted how he used to make 10 trips to Amritsar every month from 1980 to February 1984 in a bid to resolve the Punjab imbroglio. “Ravinder Singh of Akali Dal and I worked very hard and many a times we thought a solution had been found, but either (Parkash Singh) Badal would drop it or Prime Minister Indira Gandhi would.” \nAmarinder said he opted out of the negotiations in February 1984, saying he had done his bit. Amarinder recalls how he was caught unawares by the military operation as he was always told that it would be the last option. “I told the PM even then, that I would quit if it took place,” he said. \nWatch| Captain Amarinder Singh talk about his biography ‘The People’s Maharaja’ and much more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:12:04.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
