Seventeen of them, or 13 per cent, were found to contain excessive and illegal levels of pesticides. A further 19 samples are still being analysed. \nConsumers flock to the sprawling market, held at Ta’ Qali on Saturday mornings, for its locally grown produce sold at competitive prices. \nMany prefer buying their greens from producers there rather than from supermarkets, opting to eat from farm to table rather than imported alternatives. \nThe results of last year’s tests, however, appear to indicate that dangerous pesticide use may be on the rise. The results were more than three times the levels reported by this newspaper in 2015. Pesticides have been linked to a wide variety of health hazards,from headaches andnausea to cancer andendocrine disruption \nThe spokesman did not give a breakdown of the level of pesticides used or what they were, but assured this newspaper that the producers had all been banned from entering the market to sell their produce for the rest of the season. \nCourt action had also been taken against them, he said. \nThe European Food Safety Authority has warned that residues resulting from the use of products intended to protect plant-based food may pose a public health risk. \nThe EU has regulations on the use of pesticides and maximum levels of residues, which are meant to be followed by farmers in Malta. \nActivists campaigning for the reduction of pesticide use worldwide say pesticides have been linked to a wide variety of health hazards, from headaches and nausea to cancer and endocrine disruption. \nAlso, chronic health effects may occur years after minimal exposure to pesticides in­gested through food and water. \nSometimes, honest farmers get caught in the crossfire of the war on excessive pesticide use. \nLast year, this newspaper reported how a strawberry farmer had his fruit confiscated and was barred from setting up his stall at the market after a UK lab found he was 10 times over the pesticide limit. \nIt turned out, however, that that the lab had tested the wrong part of the fruit (the leaves) and also checked for the wrong type of chemical. \nThe use of foreign laboratories has long irked sellers who set up stalls at the market, as they argue that the wait for results could mean their produce turns rotten before being given a clean bill of health. \nAlternatively, consumers have complained that selling fruit before it is checked could see harmful pesticides making their way onto the dinner table. \nSamples are tested in accredited labs across the EU, mostly in Italy and Spain. \nQuestions sent yesterday to the authority on whether any local labs could conduct the tests and if any had been identified had not been answered at the time of writing. 17 of 133 samples had excessive pesticide levels.
