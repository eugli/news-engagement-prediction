Rob Demovsky of ESPN relayed comments Tuesday the running back made on the Know Them From Adam podcast with the outlet's Adam Schefter . He confirmed a return to the Packers is on the table, though he'll hit the open market if no deal is reached before March 9. \"Talking to my agent, the Packers have been very vocal about having me back there,\" Lacy said. The 26-year-old Alabama product told Schefter he hasn't looked too far into the future while trying to get back to full strength. He'll worry about the next step once the new league year gets underway if he's not re-signed by the Packers over the next 10 days, per Demovsky. \"I'm trying not to think about all of that right now,\" Lacy said. \"I'm just trying to make sure whether I end up in Green Bay or somewhere, I'm in the best shape or I'm in the best position I can be in personally, so when it's time for me to contribute to whatever team that it is that they're getting 100 percent of me.\" The 2013 Pro Bowl selection topped 1,100 rushing yards in each of his first two seasons in the NFL . His performance and overall involvement within the Packers offense dropped during the 2015 season due to lingering weight problems . Lacy showcased more burst to open the 2016 campaign after going through an intense offseason workout regimen. He averaged 5.1 yards per carry in five games before the ankle injury. Schefter and Chris Mortensen of ESPN reported in late October the running back's weight had \"returned to the 2015 frame when team sources say he was anywhere from 255 to 265 pounds.\" It's unclear where Lacy tips the scales right now after going through the recovery process, but he told Schefter he hoped to return to normal activities like running soon. Lacy could prove valuable as backfield depth alongside Ty Montgomery, a converted receiver who still must prove he's capable of handling a 16-game workload.
