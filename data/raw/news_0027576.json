Alastair Cook no longer an officer but still an asset to England’s new commander | Vic Marks Read more \nThe 26-year-old, who had been operating vice-captain under his predecessor, Alastair Cook, since May 2015, will have his promotion officially confirmed on Monday morning once it is approved by the England Wales Cricket Board. \nCook had called time on his four-and-half years in the job last Monday citing the need for a fresh voice to be heard in a dressing room that, he admitted, had stagnated in 2016, losing eight of its 17 Test matches and finishing the year with a crushing 4-0 defeat in India. \nRoot, as the leading batsman in the side was the standout candidate among the emerging generation of players, will now look to drive the team forward alongside his expected vice-captain, Ben Stokes . His reign will begin at Lord’s on 6 July with the first of four Tests against South Africa. \nWith a three-match series at home to West Indies following immediately after the visit of the Proteas, Root will have seven Tests in total to shape his side before the defence of the Ashes gets underway at the Gabba in Brisbane on 23 November. \nThere will naturally be concerns as to how the additional responsibilities that come with the captaincy will affect Root’s returns, not least since he remains a key player for England in all three formats and became a father in January. \nRoot has risen to most challenges since making his Test debut in Nagpur in late 2012, however, averaging 52.8 from his 53 caps to date – including 11 hundreds during this time – and is currently third in the world Test batting rankings. 'Bad cop' Ben Stokes fronts the queue to become Joe Root’s England deputy Read more \nEngland will hope the additional responsibility brings a greater ruthlessness to his game – just three of his last 17 scores in excess of 50 having been converted into hundreds – and that his time back in the ranks of the one-day and Twenty20 sides, under captain Eoin Morgan, will prevent the role from being all-consuming. \nHaving broken into the side aged 22, Root’s captaincy experience has been limited to date, having led Yorkshire just three times in the County Championship to go with a single fixture in charge of England Lions in 2013 and handful of matches at age group level. \nBut in Cook, who led England in a record 59 Tests, he will have a valuable resource, with the 32-year-old opener switching to a new role as a senior player and looking to continue his record-breaking career for another four to five years.
