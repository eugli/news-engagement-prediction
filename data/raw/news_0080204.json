Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 26, 2017 \nA battle has been raging on the Sunday morning news shows about whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions should recuse himself from any investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.

Those reports were leaked out through administration sources and Trump used a Friday speech to rip the usage of anonymous sources. \nThe White House has maintained that there is no connection between Trump and the Russians and all this reporting does is serve to remind Democrats of their defeat in the 2016 presidential election. \nIt's unclear if this information that was leaked was classified or not.
