The BMA has shared the construction area with the MRT's Blue Line extension on Charan Sanitwong Road. \nMr Chakkaphan said the BMA will hold talks on Monday with the Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA), overseeing the Blue Line extension to discuss the delay to ensure the two projects will finish on schedule. \nEarlier, the BMA sought help from the MRTA to add a traffic lane near Fai Chai junction, allowing for more cars and it had agreed, he added. \nAs for the Suthawas Road expansion project, Mr Chakkaphan said he had ordered the Bangkok Noi district chief to prepare for the relocation of more than 300 trees near the project to make way for construction. \nSutthiwat Road, which links Itsaraphap and Charan Sanitwong roads and runs alongside railway tracks, will be expanded from two lanes to four lanes. To help facilitate traffic flow, a two-lane 350-metre flyover will also be built to cross Charan Sanitwong Road. \nAs for the Arun Amarin Bridge project, Mr Chakkaphan said he has sought help from the MRTA to use an area near Wat Luang Por Bot Noi owned by the MRTA for vendors who have been affected by the project, allowing work to continue.
