Therefore this would be a private matter between the individual officer, like any other citizen injured by a stolen car, and the insurance company involved,\" he said. \n\"Such information is not recorded or required by police. Image caption A spokesman from the Police Federation for Northern Ireland was keen to stress it was a matter for individual officers \n\"As with any collision the issue of the fault of the driver is also relevant, so for example, if an officer was held to be negligent, then other parties (even if this involved a stolen car) would direct their claims against the PSNI. \n\"It is important to note that the same rules apply for any individual wanting to pursue a civil claim, whether they are a police officer or member of the public.\" \nMr Duffin said his no-claims bonus was likely to be affected and he feared his car insurance premiums could increase as a result. \nThe PSNI acknowledged this may be the case. 'Negligence' \n\"Although the victim is entirely innocent and someone else has stolen the vehicle, their insurance may go up as a result of a claim under their policy - that is simply the nature of car insurance,\" a spokesperson said. \nA spokesman from the Police Federation for Northern Ireland was also keen to stress that it was a matter for individual officers. \n\"These are legal remedies open to officers and the decision as to whether or not to pursue a personal claim against an individual's insurance policy is something officers must decide for themselves,\" he said. \nPersonal injury lawyer, Jennifer Young, said this was a police officer's only option if they were hurt when on duty by an uninsured driver. She explained why they would not claim on the PSNI's policy. \n\"The police officers would have to show that their employers have been at fault in some way or that they've caused the accident, or that they failed to put in adequate safeguards in place to protect them when they were on duty,\" she said. \n\"In this situation, the accident was caused as a result of the negligent driving of the uninsured driver who has stolen the vehicle and so in that case a claim against the PSNI wouldn't be likely to get off the ground as there is no negligence on their part.\" \nMr Duffin has a new car and is now waiting to see what his next insurance bill will be. \n\"I will see were my no claims bonus stands when I renew in September. I just have to live with it. It's bad enough with the criminal case coming up and now having this on top of me as well,\" he said.
