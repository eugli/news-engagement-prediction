It’s a military operation.” \nThe president said DHS Secretary John F. Kelly, who is attending meetings in Mexico with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, “has been unbelievable at the border.” \n“All of a sudden for the first time, we’re getting gang members out,” Mr. Trump said. “What has been allowed to come into our country, when you see gang violence that you’re read about like never before, much of that is people who are here illegally. And they’re rough and they’re tough, but they’re not tough like our people. So we’re getting them out.” \nMr. Kelly authorized federal agents this week to begin arresting and deporting more illegal immigrants, lifting restrictions that the Obama administration had imposed and putting millions of people in the country without authorization at risk of deportation. In two memos, Mr. Kelly unleashed a new immigration enforcement push nationwide.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:18:24.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
