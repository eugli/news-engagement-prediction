CHARLES COUNTY • A 24-person contingent from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has joined the investigation of the fire that destroyed the landmark clubhouse at Bogey Hills Country Club on Friday. \nCentral County Fire and Rescue, the local fire department involved, said ATF's national response team and special agents from ATF's Kansas City field office were activated Sunday to take part in the probe. \nAlso involved are the state fire marshal's office and the St. Charles County Police Department. \nThe ATF response team — one of four around the country — can respond within 24 hours to assist local departments. \nAssistant Chief Steve Brown with Central County Fire and Rescue said ATF's assistance was requested because of the size and extent of the fire scene. He said there is no indication at this point that arson was involved. \nHe said the federal agency has the capability of bringing in heavy equipment and other resources not readily available to local and state officials. \nNo one was hurt in the fire, which broke out shortly before midnight Thursday. Brown said the investigation is expected to take most of this week.
