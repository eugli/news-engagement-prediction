Ashwani Mishra | ETCIO | February 21, 2017, 11:24 IST GE , the multinational company founded in 1892, hasn’t been known for its software. It is reasserting its superiority by reinventing itself and betting big on the Industrial Internet — the convergence of industrial machines, data, and the Internet. In this interview, Anthony Thomas , Group CIO , GE Global, who manages IT for GE outside the US-market with a primary objective to drive business growth speaks with Ashwani Mishra on the role of the CIO in the digital age, how this traditional manufacturer is remaking itself into a modern digital business with Predix , a platform for the industrial internet at the core and creating transformation by extending industrial automation to the cloud . Edited excerpts: Q. How is the role of the CIO evolving in the digital era and what are the greatest challenges that they face? Digital at the end of the day is about technology and I see the CIO being the front and center of driving this transformation.In the digital age it is all about how you drive productivity. Between 1990 to 2010, industrial companies witnessed an average annual productivity increase of 4 percent. This number fell down to below one percent as a result of the time and effort taken to digitize core processes. I am sure we will now see the productivity metrics increase as we connect the world of IT with the physical world of machines.For CIOs across industries, the question is how they can find the right tools, right process improvements, optimize and most importantly how can they drive the net revenue for their business. These are the challenges that they must address. Q. A handful of CIOs have proved that they can bring more than technology expertise to the table and have found a seat in the boardroom. However, there are many who still present themselves in narrow terms, touting their technology expertise but failing to articulate their broader experience and strengths. To be candid not many CIOs can make it to the board room and it has nothing to do with technology. The question is whether CIOs know the business in and out? Do they know how their company makes money?The days of CIOs being strictly technologists are long over. They are no longer expected to merely keep the “lights on.”What business is interested today is in the innovative capabilities that a CIO can deliver. For instance, how can IT solve the issues of field agents in terms of sales and provide better visibility to the business.There is no science to it. My answer to this is whether CIOs are speaking the right language, do they understand customer problems, business requirements etc. These are the basics that need to be thought at all times not only by the CIOs but their team as well.In one of my previous companies, I was speaking about what my achievements in IT. I was stopped by my colleague, and asked about the value that I brought to the business in what I did. It was a great learning for me. This is the type of thinking that is required. CIOs need to bring in value in what they do. And value can only be delivered if one understands the business. Q. What was the idea behind Predix, and how is GE transforming businesses and leading the digital industrial era with this industrial cloud-based operating system & services? We wanted to have right set of platform and capabilities in the industrial world. We had two options, either we buy one or create our own platform. We decided to choose the latter and that’s how Predix came into existence. Predix is GE’s cloud platform for the industrial internet that can bind together machine, engineering and sourcing data. Predix is built exclusively for industry, providing GE and its partners with a platform designed to meet the unique strength, scale and security requirements of industrial data. We are building applications on top of it and have opened it to our customers, and to the world. So, if they want to write apps, applications on Predix, they are invited to do so.Predix has created a positive impact on our internal IT to build software and analyze things uniquely. The IT team developed this application to connect systems across the company to find overlaps across all of GE’s businesses. It is today helping us to share and learn along with the ecosystem.We have 400 plus large partners who work with us on Predix and over 19,000 developers building on it, after we opened the platform to global customers last year. In this new digital world, even fierce competitors are becoming partners; to improve and/or create new solutions and provide value to end customers. Q. So is it more of an inside out approach that you are taking with Predix? It depends. Sometimes it works inside out and at times outside in. A lot of learnings come from outside as well. We look at three levels within the company. The first is GE for GE. If it works for us it can work for others. The second is GE for customers. This essentially means that whatever we can create and build, we can take it to our customers, and finally GE for world. Sometimes it so happens that our customer can face a problem that we may not have encountered. So we work for them to solve it and re-apply it back internally or for our other customers. Q. Can you share an example of using Predix in the Indian context? Take for instance the Conference of Parties (CoP) protocol or Paris COP21 goals on combating climate change which our country signed last year. India has committed to cutting down greenhouse gas emissions to combat global warming by improving the performance and efficiency of coal-fired steam power plants.Coal is forecasted to remain the world’s second largest energy source through 2030, and an even more critical source of electricity in developing economies like India. The real issue is that whether the power plants in the country are aware what risks they are exposed to. Do they really know what kind of emissions, how much and from which machines are this being released. There is a lot of risk and the government is going to closely monitor the emission levels.Our team created a mechanism to understand the pollution levels of each of these plants based on open available data. We relied on Predix to collect this data that was then made available to our data scientists who studied and analyzed it. So when we start co-relating this information with machine data we can also predict the contributing factors to such risks and take precautionary actions. This can help power plants to increase efficiency, lower emissions and reduce cost by a certain percentage.
