five times more venous than their female counterparts - being particularly aggressive.\nFind out more about spidersâ€™ impressive skills - from BBC iWonder\nThe small and deadly funnel-web spider Named after their irregularly-shaped webs, funnel-web spiders live in moist habitats - such as under logs or shrubbery - or rotting parts of trees There are 40 species, not all of which are dangerous The Sydney Funnel-web Spider, is probably responsible for most recorded deaths and the most serious bites They sometimes fall into swimming pools, where they can live up to 30 hours under water Their venom can lead to heart collapse, affect the nervous system and intestines, and cause difficulty in breathing There have been 13 recorded deaths from funnel-web spider bites in Australia - nobody has died since an anti-venom programme began Most species live in wet forest regions of the east coast and highlands of Australia, from Tasmania to north Queensland Sources: Australian Museum , US National Library of Medicine", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/FB7A/production/_86087346_gettyimages-56714646.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/FA34/production/_84525046_464x2.jpg", "https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002844.htm", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8870/production/_87882943_funnelweb.jpg", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/boy-10-given-12-vials-of-antivenene-after-funnelweb-bite/news-story/445d8f98ac6cf02601572e9a9896f391", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/FA34/production/_84525046_464x2.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-35378879", "http://australianmuseum.net.au/funnel-web-spiders-group", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zc472hv"], "published": "2017-02-24T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:57:00.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
