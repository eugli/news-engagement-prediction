Most of these are Te Reo terms used widely by non-Māori who wish to show their support and understanding of Māori culture and its influence in New Zealand society. \nThis was Andrew Little's intent when he criticised any Māori political leader seeking a relationship with the National Government as not \"kaupapa Māori\". \nOn Tuesday, he said the Maori Party is not \"kaupapa Maori\" and has \"represented nothing for Maori\" in its relationship with the National Party. JASON DORDAY/FAIRFAX NZ \nAndrew Little's divisive rhetoric itself is not kaupapa Māori, as it seeks to label good or bad Māori regardless of their contribution to Māoridom. \nLittle told Radio NZ that the Maori Party had \"hitched its wagon to the National Party for the whole time the National Party has been in Government\". \nREAD MORE: * Turia lashes out at Labour Party \n\nThis was not a gaff, it was a political move, and part of his strategy to bring culturally Māori voters back to Labour. \nPolitical parties seeking to grow their support within Māoridom often perform similar - but generally less combative - gestures to Māori. \nThese include visiting Rātana pā, promising to keep the Māori seats around for a few more years, and working with select Māori elders with influence whom they see as capable of bringing a large swathe of untapped Māori voters to the booth. \nFor the Labour Party this has also included selecting Māori candidates with leadership whakapapa – three of Labour's seven Māori MPs have two immediate family members who have been Members of Parliament, while Nanaia Mahuta is considered royalty in Waikato-Tainui. Ad Feedback \nThere is nothing fundamentally un-Māori about this, indeed as Māori our mana comes not just from ourselves and our actions but also from our ancestors and connection to our tribal land. \nNevertheless, by Little's own logic, Māori have a choice to make between what he sees as the 'non-kaupapa opportunism' of the Māori and Mana parties, or the Chief-caste representation of Labour's selected sons and daughters of tribal elders. \nLittle's divisive rhetoric itself is not kaupapa Māori, as it seeks to label good or bad Māori regardless of their contribution to Māoridom. \nFormer Labour MP Dame Tariana Turia, who chose to risk a six-figure income to stand against the very un-kaupapa Māori Foreshore and Seabed Act would be, according to Little's rhetoric, not kaupapa Māori. \nWhanau Ora, the whanau support model, which utilises kaupapa Māori ideals to provide support services to tens of thousands of people who have often been repeatedly failed by government departments, is also not kaupapa Māori according to Little. \nEven the great Sir Apirana Ngata's legacy is not a kaupapa Māori one according to this new definition. \nKaupapa Māori is a big concept but one which boils down to appreciation and promotion of Māori self-determination and the ability of Māori to practice our culture freely. \nTo some Māori, kaupapa Māori ideals are not as important as policy outcomes – unemployment numbers, hospital waiting times, local school performance – to others all of these are kaupapa Māori issues, as they affect the ability of Māori to live in a kaupapa Māori way. \nHow Māori arrive at self-determination and how we ensure our ability to practice our culture is open to healthy debate, and if Little sought to debate this thoughtfully it would be a worthwhile discussion. Unfortunately for Little and Labour and his attempt to woo culturally Māori voters, his strategy now appears closer to 'divide and conquer' than earnest discussion on what matters to the Māori electorate. \nHaimona Gray (Ngati Kahungunu) is a public relations consultant working in the Māori, NGO and health industries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:53:44.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
