One of Katy Perry ’s backup dancers fell off the stage during her BRIT Awards performance in London on Wednesday, February 22, and thus Left Shark 2.0 was born. The backup dancer who took a tumble instantly became a meme, and the fact that they were dressed as a White House made it all the better. Biggest Celeb Bloopers Ever!

At one point during her performance, one of the tiny houses found themselves too close to the edge of the stage and they tumbled over. The skeletons also held hands in reference to when Trump held May’s hand during a White House visit last month. Katy Perry on stage at the Brit Awards at the O2 Arena, London on Feb 22, 2017.
