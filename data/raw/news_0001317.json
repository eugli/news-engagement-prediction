(ABC Radio Hobart: Carol R채채bus) \nThough the majority of dancers in the Hobart Town Hall were female, there was proof that dancing was not just for girls. \nCampbell Braithwaite was the only male dancer at the event and said he was pursuing a career in music theatre. \n\"World Tutu Day is a global event to promote ballet training and education, which is really important,\" he said. \n\"I think now there is a lot more opportunities for guys to dance, which is really promising to see. It's influencing more males to build a career out of it. \n\"There's definitely a lot more guys coming into dance which is great to see.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:02:17.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
