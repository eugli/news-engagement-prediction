The former Manchester United gaffer was notorious for his dressing room ‘hairdryer’, in which he grilled players for underperforming. It served him well for his entire 27 year tenure at Old Trafford, and now Spurs striker Kane reckons Pochettino has that same fury which helps him get the best out of his players. “Yes, he can get angry,” the 23-year-old said. “He’s normally a very calm manager especially when dealing with the press and he is always very respectful. “But he has that other side to him in the dressing room or during games – he is so very passionate. “That is the side of him that fans don’t see.” Kane, who has scored 15 times in 22 appearances across all competitions this season, following on from scoring 32 goals in his previous two seasons for club and country. The Tottenham Hotspur striker lifted the lid on the tough regime the Spurs manager has imposed on the players, telling Yahoo Sport he and his teammates are improving day by day as a result. He added: “Personally I love training and getting paid to play football is incredible. Playing the game and working hard is what I have always dreamed of doing. “The double sessions are tough. The manager wants us to get fit, wants us to work hard. And that’s because the Premier League is so tough. We need it. Something we have to do. “We all look forward to it. It’s making us better players and we owe it to ourselves to take it as seriously as possible. I definitely enjoy them and I know the team does as well. “The sessions tend to differ though. A football related one in the morning, working with the ball, technical stuff, followed by a gym-related session in the afternoon concentrating on lower body strength, power and stuff like that. “We don’t always end with a game either. It varies. Might be tactical work but not always a game.” The 6ft tall England striker added that Belgium international Mousa Dembele was the club’s best five-a-side footballer. “When we do have a game I try and make sure I am on Dembele’s team if possible,” he added. “He is so hard to knock off the ball, is powerful and skilful. And on a 1 v 1 he is just about unstoppable.” Kane is a Lucozade Sport ambassador. 100 lucky football fans will get a chance to train with him on Monday February 6, as part of Lucozade Sport’s Made To Move campaign which aims to get one million people moving more by 2020. Kane is taking his role with the drinks company seriously and insisted: “It’s important that I get to meet fans and mix with them. “As a Premier League player you become a role model to a lot of young fans and it’s good that I can give something back. “It’s great to help people train, help people get moving and it will hopefully be a good bit of fun. There is a need to get people working hard and the more there the better it will be.” “You never know, there might be a great player who turns up and I will be on the lookout for talent.” For your chance to train with Harry Kane as part of Lucozade Sport Made To Move campaign follow the instructions on Harry’s Twitter page or click here .
