Article continues below \nWhile it was a tremendous win for the struggling Los Che, Ronaldo managed to grab the majority of the headlines in the aftermath for his behaviour at the full-time whistle. \nDespite the fact that Ronnie has 22 goals in 27 appearances for Madrid this season, the Bernabeu faithful have become increasingly vocal about their displeasure at his work rate amongst other things. Article continues below \nAccording AS via Spanish channel Cuatro, the Portuguese legend shouted after the game: “I scored a goal, what did you do?” at an unnamed individual, thought to be a teammate, as he made his way to the tunnel at full-time. \nIs the pressure getting to him? \nBut Marca have now cleared up what really happened and it turns out that Ronaldo was speaking to former Manchester United teammate, now Valencia man, Nani. \nHowever, the Portuguese international teammates were not having a heated confrontation as initial reports suggested, it was merely a joke from Ronaldo. \nGood to see CR7 was in such a jovial mood following such an avoidable loss. \nAfter enjoying a 40-match unbeaten run, Zinedine Zidane's men have found the last few weeks tough going. \nAlthough they have managed to keep winning, they have been struggling to look convincing while doing so and they had to come from behind against Napoli in the Champions League last week, giving up an away goal in the process. \nRonaldo and Nani won three Premier League titles together at Old Trafford, the Champions League in 2008 and the European Championships with Portugal in the summer of 2016. \nReports of Ronaldo throwing his toys out of the pram can settle down on this occasion. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
