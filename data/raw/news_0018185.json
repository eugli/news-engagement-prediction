The action sparked protests by supporters of Garcia de Rayos and drew praise from proponents of stricter enforcement of immigration laws. \"The case involving Mrs. Garcia de Rayos illustrates a new reality for the Mexican community living in the United States, facing the most severe implementation of immigration control measures,\" Mexico's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday. Mexican consulates \"have intensified their work of protecting fellow nationals, foreseeing more severe immigration measures to be implemented by the authorities of this country, and possible violations to constitutional precepts during such operations and problems with due process,\" the statement said. On Wednesday, Garcia de Rayos made her eighth visit to the immigration office since her 2008 arrest and conviction for using a fake Social Security number.

Her attorney said the deportation was a direct result of President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration. US immigration officials said there was nothing special about her case -- she committed a crime and her deportation order was enforced. The Mexican Foreign Ministry statement said, \"It is important that fellow nationals familiarize themselves with the different scenarios they might encounter and know where they can go to receive new information and know all their rights.\" The statement said consular officials from Nogales, Arizona, were present when Garcia de Rayos was deported back to Mexico on Thursday to ensure it was done in a \"dignified and safe\" manner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T19:55:03.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
