By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 22, 2017 5:19 PM Foreign Secretary, S. Jaishankar with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi before a meeting in Beijing on Wednesday. (PTI) \nFollowing talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar has today asserted that China is committed towards developing positive relations despite differences. According to a report by the India Today, Jaishankar said that in his talks with his Chinese counterparts, he has cleared that India is tough on the ban on Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar. He has further stated that China must support sanctions on the steps against the Mumbai attack mastermind. \nChina and India today held their upgraded strategic dialogue to shore up bilateral ties amid hectic parleys to resolve differences over Beijing’s reluctance to support India’s NSG bid as well as a UN ban on JeM chief Masood Azhar. Speaking to India Today, Jaishankar asserted that China is open to support India’s NSG bid. \nSpeaking to the Chinese media, earlier in the day, Jaishankar said, “China has a very strong, principled position on counter-terrorism. We hope the position China already has will be further implemented.” \nAlso Watch: \nOn the issue of India’s absences from the One Belt and One Road initiative that includes the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which passes through Kashmir, a region claimed by both Islamabad and New Delhi, Jaishankar said, “For us, there are questions of sovereignty which need to be addressed first.” \nWelcoming Jaishankar, co-chair of the dialogue, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China and India are two major developing countries and emerging markets besides important nations in the world. Referring to the high level talks held by officials from both sides on critical issues before today’s dialogue, he said, “We have to have frequent meetings. I am certain by raising the level of this strategic dialogue the two sides will be able to enhance their strategic communication, reduce misunderstanding and build more trust and deepen our strategic cooperation. This way we can better tap into the potential of our bilateral relations and live up to our responsibilities.” \n(With inputs from agencies) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:05:44.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
