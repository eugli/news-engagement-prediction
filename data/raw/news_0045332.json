The British actress paid homage to her heroine’s French countryside beginnings when she posted a Louis Vuitton look to her new Instagram account earlier today. On location for a photo call at hotel Le Meurice in Paris, Watson took a page from the cartoon’s bookish protagonist, reimagining the sky blue pinafore Belle wears throughout the animated 1991 classic with a fashion-forward edge.
