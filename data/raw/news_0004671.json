Read More NEW DELHI: Twenty-four recruits, including 11 women, completed the bomb disposal training at the Police School of Explosive Handling in Nowshera district of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province , a Pakistan daily reported. \"1,607 cops, including 12 females, had been trained at the school so far,\" School Director Niaz Muhammad Yousafzai was quoted as saying by the News International. \"Three sisters - Parveen Gul, Rukhsana and Samina - were among 11 women who completed their training yesterday (on Tuesday). The other female officers who completed the training were from Nowshera, Abbottabad, Hangu, Charsadda, Mardan, Buner and Bannu,\" Yousafzai said. After passing out parade, the three sisters said that they were trained in light and heavy weaponry besides bomb disposal exercise. \"We come from a humble background. My father (Nooran Shah) had been physically challenged by birth,\" said Parveen Gul, who is the eldest among the three sisters who have joined the force. \"I got attracted to the police force when I would see cops in mobile vans in Karak (her village). I didn't know that one day I will become part of the force,\" Parveen said. Last year, 29-year-old Rafia Qaseem Baig became the first Pakistani female to join the bomb disposal unit after completing her 15-day training along with 31 other male members in December.
