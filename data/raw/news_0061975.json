Article continues below \nNot to mention the fact they are currently embroiled in the tightest race for the top four in recent memory. \nStill, the winner in the Special One wants to compete on all fronts possible and he refuses to travel the same path as city rivals Man City have chosen to in the process.

I cannot do that. We are Manchester United. \n“I don’t do that as Manchester United manager. I don’t do that to the FA Cup because the FA Cup is not guilty of these decisions. \n“The FA Cup is beautiful, the competition is historical. I have to treat Manchester United supporters and the FA Cup in the right way. \n“I cannot go there with U21s. Probably they would deserve it but I don’t do that.\" \nJose has set his stall out clear as day: Manchester City might think playing the kids in certain cups is ok, but Manchester United do not. \nSpouting such a sentiment in the name of the fans is extremely noble and endearing, but, at its core, is the statement just another classic Mourinho jab? \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
