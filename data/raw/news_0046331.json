Capello had a significant influence on the 35-year-old's style of play when he played under him for two seasons at Juventus. He joined the club in 2004 and had a blistering debut season, scoring 16 goals in all competitions.

Ibrahimovic bagged the winning goal for United against Blackburn in the FA Cup fifth round It took him a season to adapt - with a cost in terms of goals - but when Ibrahimovic moved on to join Inter Milan, it had made him a better player.

Ibrahimovic and the Old Trafford club take on St Etienne in the Europa League on Wednesday night.
