It is also backed by Stephen Dorrell, the former Conservative cabinet minister, Bianca Jagger, Lord Malloch-Brown, the former UN deputy secretary-general, and Charlie Mullins, the millionaire founder of Pimlico plumbers. Lord Hill, who resigned as the UK's EU commissioner after the Brexit vote, dismissed the idea of a final vote today. Millionaire plumber Charlie Mullins, pictured outside the High Court after judges ruled the new law was necessary in November, has also signed the demand to peers Astronomer Royal Lord Rees and former Tory minister Stephen Dorrell are also signatories to the letter about Brexit He told the BBC that Britain needs to show consistency and clarity in the negotiations. 'I think the idea that at the end of that process of negotiation, a British negotiator says ''Oh, I'm terribly sorry, that deal that I've just offered you, and struck with you, I'm afraid that Parliament have just voted on it and have changed the terms'' - I don't see how we can negotiate in good faith if we were to proceed on that basis.' Peers will nod through the Article 50 legislation tomorrow night before considering it in committee next week. The Government is braced for defeat on at least two amendments to the Bill as an alliance of Labour, Liberal Democrat and independent cross bench peers will overwhelm the 252 Tory peers. Defeat will briefly delay the legislation as it will force the Bill back into the Commons in a round of 'parliamentary ping pong'. Former EU commissioner Lord Hill dismissed the call, insisting Britain could not go back and demand a better deal from Brussels just because Parliament was unhappy The House of Lords is due to begin debate on the historic Article 50 legislation later today amid demands for changes to the legislation Labour has said it has no intention of derailing the legislation, which is expected to be law by the middle of March, in time to meet Mrs May's deadline for triggering Article 50. Labour's leader in the Lords Baroness Angela Smith said Parliament must have a say in the final Brexit deal. 'If the Government are saying 'we don't want a deal, we want longer engagement', or whatever. Parliament should be engaged in that process,' she said. 'If there is this ongoing parliamentary engagement, all of us can get involved in this. Waiting for two years' time is the wrong thing. 'It can't be we say to Theresa May 'bye by, off you go come back in two years with a deal', that's not good enough. 'All the House of Lords can do is ask the Commons to look at an issue again. I don't see any extended ping pong on this at all.'
