Atlanta’s WSB-TV explains that authorities say Bankroll can be seen holding and firing an assault rifle, possibly aiming at a black car parked across the street. They believe this might be evidence that he fired the first shot in the incident. Previous evidence confirmed that 50 shots in all were fired. \nIn a controversial interview with DJ Vlad in July, No Plug admitted to killing Bankroll Fresh and said he acted in self-defense. \nInvestigators say it is too early to draw any conclusions about what exactly happened that night. \n“What you see on the video, even though it might be as clear as day, there might be something more to it than what you’re actually seeing,” Major Adam Lee III of Atlanta Police says. \nThe District Attorney is now handling the case and a spokesperson said in a statement that the investigation is taking longer than initially estimated. \n“We are considering additional evidence we discovered in the case,” the statement says, “because of this information, we have not been able to make a decision by the original deadline. One we reach a decision, we will notify the families and then the public.” \nEarlier this month, HipHopDX spoke with Cassius Jay , who produced Bankroll Fresh’s hit song “Hot Boy” about keeping the rapper’s legacy alive. \n“ He was a good guy and stuff, so I don’t feel like I should in a way,” he says of releasing new music. “His family can do it, but I shouldn’t be releasing none of his music because they didn’t give me the consent to do it. I don’t even really try to bring it up to ‘em because you know how the industry is right now, so I just was like whatever it was we did, we’re just gonna leave it at that and that was ‘Hot Boy’ and that was his biggest song, so I just wanted to leave it at that ‘cause we was real close.” Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
