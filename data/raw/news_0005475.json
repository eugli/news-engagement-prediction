(Photo: Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports) \nAs midseason requests go, LeBron James’ recent call for an additional playmaker to be added to the Cleveland Cavaliers roster isn’t nearly as bold as, say, unscheduled trips to Miami that had become an annual tradition of sorts for one of the game’s greats. \nAnd let’s not forget how those subplots played out: with James and the Cavs reaching the Finals in 2015, then ascending to the NBA’s mountaintop for the first time in franchise history last June. \nThis time around, as the Cavs scuffle through this stretch in which they’ve lost seven of their past 11 games, this a different version of the same story. James is clearly seeking rest and recovery again, and thus he wants help when it comes the regular season workload. And who – Charles Barkley notwithstanding – can blame him? \nAt 32 years old, he leads the league in minutes per game (37.5) and has now played more regular season minutes than all but six of the league’s current players (40,130, behind Dirk Nowitzki, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, Joe Johnson, and Jason Terry). His Cavs are down two starters for the foreseeable future, with shooting guard J.R. Smith (thumb surgery) expected to be out until April and forward Kevin Love (back soreness) out indefinitely after he underwent an MRI on Monday (it showed no structural damage, but Love is clearly hurting). And truth be told, no one outside of those players on the late ‘50s-60s Boston Celtics teams can truly understand the wear and tear that comes with making six consecutive trips to the Finals. \nThis playmaker problem isn’t necessarily about making the Cavs better in the big picture, but about James’ personal gas tank and his fear of it being empty by the time the playoffs roll around. All of which sets the stage for this playmaker workout on Wednesday, when Barkley’s harsh criticism of James for his roster laments won’t matter nearly as much as the job interview at hand. \nHELP WANTED (MORE LIKE NEEDED) \nAccording to two people with knowledge of the situation, the Cavs plan on hosting Mario Chalmers, Lance Stephenson, Kirk Hinrich on Wednesday as a means to this James-fueled end. There will likely be a fourth player taking part as well, but it remains unclear just who that might ultimately be. The people spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity because the details of the workout aren’t disclosed by the team. \nThe Cavs could take the trade route too, of course, and they are known to have inquired about the Dallas Mavericks’ Deron Williams. The 32-year-old, three-time All-Star is in the final year of his deal ($9 million), and it’s worth noting that Dallas has shown interest in the Cavs’ Iman Shumpert previously when he was a free agent (he’s owed a combined $31 million for this season and the next two, with a player option for 2018-19). \nWhen it comes to NBA players who can draw a crowd by holding up a ‘Help Wanted’ sign, James may top the list. The asset-depleted Cavs are looking to buy low to fill their final roster spot, too, which creates a sliver of hope for anyone and everyone who believes they could fill this role. Facebook Posted!
