Damaged or outdated drivers often result in situations where the devices you need and use most (such as mouse or keyboard) fail to respond. At this point, two solutions lay ahead: update the drivers manually, which is a time-consuming process or leave the job to a professional software solution, such as 3DP Chip. Next to AIDA or Driver Detective , 3DP Chip might seem like an old-fashioned solution, but judge it only after you’ve experimented with it. Even though it’s much simpler than the aforementioned solutions, it’s just as effective and far less resource consuming. Clean feature lineup The user-friendly interface displays information for devices such as CPU, Motherboard, Video Card, Multimedia, Ethernet Card and Mouse. Just beneath all of these, you can take a peek at the CPU clock, memory size, as well as operating system. You can also copy the system's information into 3DP Chip's clipboard and submit a bug report to the developers, in case the software does not correctly detect your devices. Additionally, the tool lets you view the versions/dates of drivers in the main panel. Backup/restore options A smart feature included in the package enables you to carry out back up operations by selecting the desired drives from a list and restore data with just a few clicks. What's more, you can check out extra details about each drive, sch as description, class, provider, date, and version, as well as exclude Microsoft products from the list. A small flaw As useful and as efficient this software is, it does have a drawback: you have to click on each device name and access its corresponding webpage, in order to check if updates are necessary or not. It would have been much comfortable if all this information was displayed in the software's interface, within the glimpse of an eye. Bottom line Other than the aforementioned inconvenience, 3DP Chip performs wonderfully. It’s extremely easy to work with it and acts light on your computer resources. All in all, it’s a great alternative to paid software, even though driver downloads are processed via web browsers and not from inside the application.
