The attack occurred on February 22 2017 (Picture: SWNS) \nDriver Susan Brown said: ‘If I hadn’t driven at them – I think they would have carried on kicking him. \n‘I was travelling to a relative’s home when I saw them in the road. I thought they were messing about – but when I got closer they were completely beating this young lad up. Brits are ditching their polite reputation to become excellent at haggling \n‘He looked in a really bad way. I drove at them and sounded my horn continuously to try to disperse them – most of them ran off.’ \nHumberside police have since made three arrests regarding the attack as Brereton Avenue was cordoned off following the injuries caused to the young victim. \nAaron Goss, who helped administer first aid to the victim at the scene, told how he came across the horrific attack when he was cycling home after work. \nHe said: ‘The paramedic had done what he could. I just helped keep traffic away and helped police set up the cordon with the tape. It is terrible.’ A woman drove at the attackers to prevent further violence (Picture: SWNS) \nA glass bottle was seized at the scene from inside the cordon and will now be examined by forensics specialists who also scoured a nearby park \nCrime scene investigators spent several hours combing the area and taking fingerprints from the car of the woman who broke up the attack. Teenager died after branch snapped and he hit head on submerged rock \nHumberside Police arrested three men after the attack on suspicion of assault. \nA spokeswoman for the force said: ‘Officers are currently on the scene working to establish the circumstances of the incident. \n‘They are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, or has information about an alleged earlier altercation in Sidney Park.’ \nHumberside Police are appealing to anyone with information to call them on 101, quoting log number 532 of February 22.
