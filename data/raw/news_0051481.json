Get your 30-day Free Trial\nBox Score: FSU 104, Boston College 72\nWhatever has been ailing the Florida State men's basketball team, it apparently was nothing a trip home to the Tucker Center couldn't fix.\nAfter losing back-to-back road games, the No. 19 Seminoles returned home Monday night and blitzed visiting Boston College, 104-72, with one of their more dominant performances of the season.\nFSU opened up a 24-point lead at halftime, 55-31, and expanded that to more than 30 points in the second half. The Seminoles dominated the hapless Eagles, who have now lost 11 straight games, in practically every statistical category.\nThe Seminoles, who improved to 22-6 overall and 10-5 in ACC play, were led offensively by Dwayne Bacon (16 points), P.J. Savoy (15), Jonathan Isaac (14) and Jarquez Smith (10). Point guard Xavier Rathan-Mayes added seven points with 10 assists, five rebounds and no turnovers.\nBacon received an ovation from the crowd early in the second half when he passed the 1,000-point barrier for his career.\nThis marked the second time this season the Seminoles exceeded 100 points against an ACC opponent; they scored 109 at home against Clemson.\nWith the loss, Boston College falls to 9-19 and 2-13.\nFSU's next game will be Saturday at Clemson at noon on ESPNU.\nStay connected to Warchant.com for more coverage of this game.", "external_links": ["http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaab/boston-college-eagles-florida-state-seminoles-201702200213/"], "published": "2017-02-21T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:47:02.089+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
