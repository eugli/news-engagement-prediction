Pyongyang has made no public comments on the issue. \nKim was largely estranged from his family, after being passed over for the North Korean leadership in favour of his youngest half-brother. He spent most of his time overseas in Macau, mainland China and Singapore. \nHe had spoken out in the past against his family's dynastic control of North Korea and in a 2012 book was quoted as saying he believed his younger half-brother lacked leadership qualities. \nBut he had said he was not interested in assuming the leadership himself.
