The Bears, as expected, will not use the franchise tag on him.\nUsing the franchise tag on Jeffery for the second season in a row would have cost the Bears $17.5 million.\nIt also would have made Jeffery, 27, the NFL’s highest paid receiver, while changing the negotiations with the team.\nLosing Jeffery in free agency, which begins with the new league year on March 9 at 3 p.m, always was a possibility.\nChicago Bears wide receiver Alshon Jeffery (17) reacts against the Washington Redskins during the first half of an NFL football game, Saturday, Dec. 24, 2016, in Chicago.

Huh) ORG XMIT: ILPS10\nCommon ground has been difficult to find in negotiations.\nJeffery’s camp is looking for a deal that would put him among the position’s elite, joining Dez Bryant, A.J. Green, Demaryius Thomas and Julio Jones.\nThe Bears are willing to commit to Jeffery but the team also has reasons to be apprehensive about the costs of a long-term deal, starting with his injury-plagued 2015 season and his four-game suspension last year for violating the league’s rules for performance-enhancing drugs.\nWith teams such as the Eagles, Titans and Rames needing help at receiver, Jeffery’s camp was able to remain adamant with its demands.\nJeffery had 52 catches, 821 yards and two touchdowns in 12 games last season. Overall, they were unimpressive numbers, though he was affected by changes at quarterback.\nThe NFL Network was first to report Monday morning that the franchise tag was unlikely for Jeffery this year.\n# bears Alshon Jeffery Chicago", "external_links": ["https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/redskins_bears_football_66059827.jpg?w=670&#038;h=447", "http://wp.me/p7fJAs-2711", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/redskins_bears_football_66059827.jpg?w=450", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/redskins_bears_football_66059827.jpg?w=1024", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/redskins_bears_football_66059827.jpg", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/redskins_bears_football_66059827.jpg?w=768", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/redskins_bears_football_66059827.jpg?w=150"], "published": "2017-02-27T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:32:19.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
