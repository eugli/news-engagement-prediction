On Tuesday, Park’s boyfriend Chris Hurst announced his intention to run for office against Joseph Yost, an incumbent Republican lawmaker who’s been endorsed by the NRA. Hurst and Parker were together nine months at the time of her death, which a reported 40,000 people watched live. A disgruntled former employee from the station live-streamed the attacks as they happened before shooting and killing himself shortly after. Hurst continued working at the station until this month. He hopes to nab the Democratic nomination in the 12th House District with a different platform on gun control than most liberals: Instead of a sweeping ban on assault weapons, he’s going to focus on keeping guns out of civilians’ hands when they are most at risk of hurting people, The Guardian reports. “What I care about most is trying to reduce the number of people who die with a gun, whether it’s homicide or suicide,\" he said. “We have a lot of work to do to cut out the BS when it comes to gun violence prevention,” Hurst explained. He’s interested in implementing a “gun violence restraining order” which would allow police or family to request a legal confiscation of weapons from someone who appears to be headed toward violence: “It would be effective. It would work.” Hurst realizes many might see him “as a single-issue candidate because my girlfriend was killed with a gun,” he told the The Roanoke Times , but he believes his journalistic background lends itself to a future in government: he encourages anyone who thinks that of him to “look at [his] body of work over the past seven years here and see how many different topics [he’s] covered and have been curious and interested in.” Advertisement - Continue Reading Below “This will certainly be one of the biggest House races this year, and maybe even bigger than the governor’s race,” Hurst’s opponent Yost told The Roanoke Times of the election.
