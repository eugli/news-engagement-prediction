Jackky will be seen doing some great action stunts in her upcoming films such as 'Reload' with Sidharth Malhotra and 'Drive'. \nWhen quizzed over how comfortable she was in performing stunts in films, she told PTI, \"Its an amazing genre and I feel very comfortable about it. If I could be the action icon in Bollywood it would be great. The roles in action genre for females are less as compared to actors. If there is something in action I take it up. I am dying to train and work in roles that gives me the opportunity to do action.\" \nJacqueline tried her hand in action for the first time during 'A Flying Jatt'. She the talked about how Bollywood can take inspiration from the West when it comes to actresses performing real stunts on-screen and how Hollywood must take cue from us in terms of what our heroes are doing. \n\"When it comes to action for females then we can take a little bit of cue from what they (Hollywood) are doing. But if you look at actors like Tiger Shroff there is lot a that West can learn from us. He is phenomenal as an action hero and he does his own stunts and he is so good at it.\" \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Thursday, February 16, 2017 - 11:47 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:01:27.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
