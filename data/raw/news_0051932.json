And I was hanging around up there for the longest time with the umbrella. I thought I felt the wire leave and drop about six inches. I was nervous and very tired.”\n“So, I called down and I said, ‘Excuse me, when you do let me down, could you let me down really gently, because I felt myself slip and I just don’t feel too safe up here.’”\nJULIE ANDREWS STILL MOURNING LOSS OF LATE HUSBAND \nHowever, Andrews’ fears came to life as she was being lowered to safety.\n“I plummeted to the stage,” explained Andrews. “I did. And there was an awful silence for a minute and I did let fly with a few Anglo-Saxon four-letter words, I have to admit.”\nAndrews also joked that the stunts happened at the end of filming because if anything went wrong she was easily dispensable with the film completed.\nThe scare may have been worth it for the veteran star, who won an Oscar for the movie. “Mary Poppins” is being set for a reboot with Emily Blunt taking on the leading role, but Andrews won’t be involved with that filming.\nAndrews will star in a new Netflix series, “Julie’s Greenroom,” which premieres March 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:19:02.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
