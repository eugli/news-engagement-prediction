We are vehemently opposed to the unethical practices that occur in the secondary market. Ticket selling websites are charging inflated prices \n“We have written to each of our partners, be they promoters, venues or ticketing companies, detailing the way in which we expect tickets to be sold: direct to fans.” \nLast year, the Mirror launched a campaign urging the Government to stop millions of sport, theatre and music fans being ripped off in what has become a £1billion a year industry.

He wrote: “This is why it is impossible to get tickets. The industry is a mess, sort ticket touts out.” \nOthers complained of having the tickets in the basket, only for the site to crash. \nBut soon afterwards, they were available for the star’s O2 Arena gig in London for £999 plus booking fees. On Seatwave tickets had gone up for sale for up to £636.

He also urged followers not to buy from them. \nThe star added: ­“Regardless of how bad you want to see someone play, don’t support and ­facilitate these sites. \n“This shows how f g shameless some people can be.” Read More Ticket touts frozen out from Who charity cancer gig after Sunday Mirror campaign \nLabour MP Sharon Hodgson, co-chair of the all-party ­parliamentary group for ticket abuse, said: “Many artists, like Ed Sheeran, are doing so much to get tickets into the hands of genuine fans, and not touts. The Government needs to step up and give artists the help they need to put their fans first.” \nLast year, a Parliamentary report found evidence of fraud, criminal activity and massive price hikes in the industry.
