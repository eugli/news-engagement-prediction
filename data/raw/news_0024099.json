They founded Coach in New York in 1961 and sold the company in 1985. Miles Cahn, who with his wife founded the Coach Leatherware Company, which helped redefine the American handbag as both chic and practical, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 95. His death was confirmed by his son-in-law, the chef Mario Batali. Mr. Cahn and his wife, Lillian Cahn, founded Coach in 1961 after buying a small wallet manufacturer on West 34th Street and renaming it. It was at Mrs. Cahn’s suggestion that they began producing their first generation of women’s handbags She was impressed by the quality of a flexible kind of cowhide used in making baseball gloves. “I scoffed at first,” Mr. Cahn told The New York Times in 2013, when his wife died at 89 . “In New York, there were a lot of handbag companies, and at that time stores were all buying knockoffs of bags made in Europe. But my wife prevailed.” One of their biggest successes was Coach’s now classic “shopping bag” purse, which was modeled on a type of paper shopping bag that Mrs. Cahn had used to make food deliveries as a girl from a series of businesses her family owned in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., during the Depression. The company’s other innovations — the bucket bag, the “tongue” bag and ones with chains and coin-purse attachments and turn lock/toggle fastenings created by the designer Bonnie Cashin — took the American purse from a stiff, impractical, ornamental pocketbook to something that women could use in their daily mothering, working or traveling lives. With their bright, attractive colors, the bags became staples in upscale wardrobes across America and helped promote a more active and progressive image of women. They retail today for up to thousands of dollars. The Cahns remained at their factory on 34th Street for years. Mrs. Cahn oversaw the showroom and promoted their products to fashion writers and editors. Sales reached about $20 million by the early 1980s. In 1985, the Cahns sold the company to Sara Lee Corporation for a reported $30 million. Under Sara Lee, Coach opened stores around the world, and expanded into a broader range of accessories including perfume, sunglasses and jewelry. \nAdvertisement Sara Lee spun off the company in 2000 for a reported $1 billion. The company reported $4.4 billion in net sales in its most recent fiscal year. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
