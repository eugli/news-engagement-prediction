Brexit will cause 'vanishingly small' fall in net migration – report Read more \nBut the document adds: “The fact that it appears to be particularly difficult for foreign nationals , even if married to UK nationals or born in the UK , to acquire permanent residence status or British nationality may colour member states’ approach to this matter.” \nThere has been almost a 50% increase in the number of EU citizens applying for permanent residency since the vote on 23 June. The number of applications rose from 36,555 in the three months to June 2016 to 56,024 in the three months to September, according to the latest figures. \nEU nationals say that to obtain permanent residency cards, applicants have to complete an 85-page form requiring huge files of documentation, including P60s for five years, historical utility bills and a diary of all the occasions they have left the country since settling in the UK. Some have received letters inviting them to prepare to leave the country after failing to tick a box on a form. A cross-party group of the European parliament has established a taskforce to investigate the complaints. Jet Cooper , and her husband Patrick.

Theresa May has said she wishes to leave the single market and the customs union but have a transitional arrangement in place with the EU after 2019, in advance of what she hopes will be a free trade agreement. The British prime minister wishes to avoid a “cliff edge”, whereby British companies lose all access to the single market and face tariffs on their exports overnight. \nIn a foreword to the report, Czech MEP Pavel Svoboda writes: “One important preliminary question affecting all policy areas is the extent to which transitional arrangements could be envisaged legally… \n“It would seem to us that such arrangements could only be adopted by international agreement or a protocol to the treaties, which would require the unanimous agreement of the member states and ratification in accordance with their national constitutional tradition. It would seem difficult, if not impossible, to reach such an agreement before the end of the period provided for in article 50.” \nThe committee also reports that while it is hoped that the challenges can be overcome, there will be an impact on the careers of British staff working within European institutions: “The European parliament, the council and the commission alone have more than 1,500 British staff members. The UK withdrawing from the European Union will definitely have an impact on their careers for, in principle, only nationals of a member state can work for the Eu institutions.” \nIt adds that without a negotiated solution the current staff “could be subject to compulsory resignation”.
