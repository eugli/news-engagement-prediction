Rochas Okorocha.” \nHe expressed optimism that people with proven cases of injustice would have their situations addressed. \n“Such persons should not panic; we shall put in everything to resolve their matters,” he said. \nThe sack hit workers from across the 27 Local Government Areas of the state. \nNAN ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:32:21.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
