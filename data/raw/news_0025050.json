Sure there's been a lot happening on Earth over the last decade, but these intergalactic heroes have enough to keep themselves occupied on other planets. As with its predecessor, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will take place in other areas of the cosmos, but at some point during the story, there will be a brief detour to Earth. Here's what Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said: \nThere's a little bit of Earth in this film, but it's not these characters going to Earth. \nCinemaBlend was around when Kevin Feige dropped this nugget of information at a Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 set visit last year, though didn't specify whether this Earth visit will take place in the present day, i.e. a couple months after Guardians of the Galaxy , or if it would be in a flashback, like with the first movie. Either way, if you had suspected that Star-Lord and the gang would visit good ol' Earth during Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , forget it. They'll be too busy dealing with Ayesha, Taserface and other opponents to head back to what the aliens call Terra. \nSo if the main protagonists won't be on Earth, who will? Well, since the Nova Corps will return in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , perhaps the police force will need to go there for some reason. However, I suspect that the \"little bit\" of Earth we'll see is connected to Ego , Peter Quill's father in the MCU. Remember, Ego visited Earth decades ago and fell in love with a human named Meredith , who eventually gave birth to Peter. Maybe we'll see a flashback that shows their time together, explains why Ego left her or reveal why he sent Yondu and the Ravagers to Earth to pick up Peter rather than fetch his son himself. \nNow for those of you who are keen to see Star-Lord return to his home planet with his friends and allies in tow, you may still get to see that. Almost all of the Guardians of the Galaxy are confirmed to appear in next year's Avengers: Infinity War , the epic movie which will have Thanos finally wreaking havoc after years of staying on the sidelines. Although Infinity War is expected to feature other worlds , there's a chance the Guardians will make it to Earth to interact with the other MCU heroes and assist in the battle against the Mad Titan. And hey, if that doesn't happen, Avengers 4 could provide another opportunity just a year later. \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will be released in theaters on May 5.
