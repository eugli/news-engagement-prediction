Bush Would Have Had Michael Flynn ‘Arrested’ Over Russian Calls by Justin Baragona | 11:47 am, February 13th, 2017 \nFormer George W. Bush speechwriter and current senor editor for The Atlantic David Frum joined Mediaite columnist John Ziegler on Ziegler’s podcast over the weekend to discuss the state of politics today. They touched on a number of subjects, such as how Donald Trump overtook the Republican Party, the role of the media in that “coup d’etat,” and how Fox News viewers tune in to be lied to. \nFollowing a discussion about the dangers facing traditional democratic institutions in today’s political climate, the conversation shifted to the possibility that Trump has been compromised by Russia. Specifically, Ziegler noted that CNN recently reported that the intelligence community has corroborated much of of the infamous Trump/Russia dossier, leading more credibility to that document. \nIn response, Frum wouldn’t say whether he agreed or not that the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin may have something on POTUS, but noted that Trump seems to be in lockstep with Russia when it comes to foreign policy. “There’s many secrets here, but no mysteries,” Frum noted, citing a novel. \nEventually, they got to National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and the current controversy surrounding him. After Ziegler recapped the Washington Post story regarding Flynn speaking to the Russian ambassador about sanctions prior to Trump’s inauguration, he asked Frum what Bush would have done if faced with a similar situation from his NSA. \n“I think he would have had him arrested,” Frum replied. \nThe former Bush aide then went on to explain the whole situation between Flynn and Russia and how the Trump adviser has now reportedly been caught lying, mentioning that he also roped the vice president in his lie. He further added that we shouldn’t just assume that Flynn was “freelancing” on this, pointing out that this isn’t really a “Flynn story — it’s a Trump story.” \nThe two men then talked about the possibility that Trump either explicitly or implicitly told Flynn to lie to Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador and what the ramifications of those actions would be. \nListen to the whole conversation above, via Free Speech Broadcasting. \n[image via screengrab] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T19:26:49.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
