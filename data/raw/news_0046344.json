To eliminate the possibility of another such tragedy , similar exercise will be conducted at Khan Market as well,\" a senior NDMC official said. \n\n\"After the safety audit is over at Khan Market, the defaulter units will be asked to submit structural stability certificates. Though the market doesn't have any heritage structure, there is a need to conduct an audit as some residential flats have been modified as shops and restaurants,\" the official said", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:55:36.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
