They are as famous as Romeo and Juliette which might give you an idea of the tragedy that's going to unfold.\"\n\"He is the greatest musician that ever lived and she is his match. So when she dies unexpectedly, he can't live without her so he journeys to the Underworld to bring her back.\"\nThe two main actors Credit: ITV News For this performance the Underworld is under one of the region's best known landmarks.\nFor years it was believed this giant structure was made of solid stone, until in 2002 engineers uncovered a series of huge vaulted chambers.\nBrunel's detailed plans for his bridge have never been found but he almost certainly never imagined it would become a stage.\nThe Clifton Suspension Bridge Credit: ITV News Justin Palmer, the show's producer, is excited for the performances, and is intrigued to see what the audience's reactions will be.\nHe said: \"I'm looking forward to seeing the audience's faces because if you've never been in here before- I'm kind of acclimatised to it but I still go 'wow, this is on the side of the gorge' but for the people who come here for the first time it's pretty exhilarating I think and you do feel like you've entered into a different kind of time zone.\"\nAnd this extraordinary performance is already proving so popular they've had to put on extra dates. Orpheus and Eurydice be descending into the Bristol underworld until the middle of March.\nWatch as our reporter John Alcock is the first person to film inside the chambers just after they have been discovered:\nPlay video Bristol Clifton Suspension Bridge", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:54:05.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
