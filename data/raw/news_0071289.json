Conversations is a weekly live chat series with leading entrepreneurs, investors and technologists. You can now ask the most important questions to people who you have expressed interest to interact with directly, and get valuable insights once every week. \nIt might not look and sound a big deal, but below are the reasons we feel it became critical for us to do this now: Time and again we hear entrepreneurs telling us that they do not get face time with leaders in business and technology to help them with answers. Events and other sources of interaction are not designed to give out classified personal information at scale. Conversations@YourStory is an effort in that direction, where we would love every entrepreneur to ask their burning questions to relevant people and get an answer. Entrepreneurship in India right now and in future will not be limited to Tier 1 cities. People from other parts of the country cannot travel all the time in order to interact with leaders. Everyone deserves to have an access to knowledge that resides with successful entrepreneurs and Conversations@YourStory is designed to serve that very purpose At YourStory we have the good fortune to interact with successful entrepreneurs, investors and technologists regularly. Successful people do have the intention of helping as many people as possible but are not able to do it because it is too time-consuming to address more than 10 people via direct conversation in a meetup. With a platform like Conversations@YourStory they are happy and more than willing to engage and talk to as many people as people in an hour. We are thankful and grateful to everyone who accepted our invite as we launch today and to the one's coming up in future. And, last but not the least, we believe great things begin with a CONVERSATION. \nComing to the most important aspect i.e what should you ask? \nWe would hate ourselves to see Conversations becoming a platform that does not give out value to aspiring and existing entrepreneurs. It can only be achieved when we are prepared and know what we want to ask in advance to get an insightful answer. \nWe have done our best to give detailed information about everyone and schedule calendar well in advance for you to RSVP to the one's that are relevant and exciting. \nThank you for being a supporter of YourStory for the last nine years and as we embark on a journey to bring new offerings this year, I am hopeful you will show the love as always ðŸ™‚ \nRSVP to attend your favorite conversations here.
