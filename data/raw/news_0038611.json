He's Just Unpleasant, Psychiatrist Says\nHe spoke of \"political debates on television where even before one (candidate) finishes talking, he is interrupted.\"\nFrancis did not single out any countries for criticism. Italian political talk shows are often shrill and last year's U.S. presidential debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were peppered with insults.\nIn one debate last September, for example, Trump called Clinton a \"nasty woman\" and she accused him of having \"engaged in racist behavior\".\nFrancis urged everyone to seek \"the patience of dialogue\".\nHe added: \"Wars start inside our hearts, when I am not able to open myself to others, to respect others, to talk to others, to dialogue with others, that is how wars begin.\"\nThe pope also warned against anti-immigrant movements, which have grown in the United States and a number of European countries, including Italy.\n\"Migrations are not a danger. They are a challenge for growth,\" he said, adding it was important to integrate immigrants into host countries so they keep their traditions while learning new ones in a process of mutual enrichment.\nHe said immigrants should be welcomed \"first of all as human brothers and sisters. They are men and women just like us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T18:42:37.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
