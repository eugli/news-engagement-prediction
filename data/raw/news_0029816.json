(Tim Hawk | For NJ.com) comments \nPENNSVILLE TWP. -- A gunshot was fired at a Salem County food trailer Tuesday night which has gained notoriety for selling unique deep-fried sandwiches, police said. \nThe Zoagie concession was open for business when the trailer was struck by a single \"armor-piercing pellet,\" according to Pennsville Chief of Police Allen J. Cummings. \nWhen the shooting took place around 7:11 p.m. the business was open and customers were in line, the chief said. \nNo one was injured. \nCummings said detectives retrieved the pellet from the body of the trailer. \nThe Zoagie concession is located on the Sunoco gas station property at the intersection of state Route 49 and South Hook Road, a heavily traveled area. \nOn Wednesday morning Cummings said information about the incident was still being investigated. \nThe Zoagie is a deep-fried sandwich created by Salem resident Ezell Barnes. \nThe sandwich starts with a deep-fried sub roll to which is added a selection of fried foods and then topped with lettuce, tomatoes and special sauces. \nBarnes' creation has received much media attention over the past few weeks. \nBill Gallo Jr. may be reached at .
