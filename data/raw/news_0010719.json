They can't be serious,\" said Jocelyn Cayer, the hospital foundation's president.\nQuebec aims to crack down on wait times, free up hospital beds with $ 100M plan Device in Saint-Hyacinthe adequate, ministry rules Radio-Canada obtained the letter the regional health authority, the CISSS de la Montérégie Est, sent to the foundation explaining the Health Ministry's refusal.\nIt said the decision was \"essentially based on clinical criteria\" and that patients in the Sorel-Tracy area can go to the Saint-Hyacinthe hospital, which has a bronchoscope. That hospital is an hour's drive away.\nBefore the Liberal caucus meeting in Quebec City Friday, Health Minister Gaétan Barrette said the decision was made at the local level.\nWhile a letter obtained by Radio-Canada said the refusal was a ministerial decision, Health Minister Gaetan Barrette said it was a local decision. (Jacques Boissinot/Canadian Press)\nHe complained that when he intervenes in local decisions, he's accused of having too much power, but when he doesn't make local decisions, he is also criticized.\nIn an email, Julie White, Barrette's media attaché, said the purchase of medical equipment is analyzed according to several criteria, including operating costs, how much demand there is for the procedure and whether staff members are trained to use it.\nWhite said the money raised could be used to benefit the local community.\nBut since the campaign was specifically aimed at buying a bronchoscope, the foundation says it must ask its major partners, such as Rio Tinto and Desjardins, before it can redirect the donations.\nQuebec health minister bans user fees Doctors may leave, foundation fears Sorel-Tracy Mayor Serge Péloquin called the decision \"unacceptable\" and criticized Barrette's health reform plan, which aims to centralize certain services.\nSorel-Tracy Mayor Serge Péloquin says a Health Ministry decision to deny a local hospital's request to buy bronchoscope with money its foundation raised is 'unacceptable.' (Radio-Canada)\nHe said it's not easy for everyone to get from Sorel to Saint-Hyacinthe, especially in the winter.\nPéloquin also pointed out the city has an industrial history and has experienced significant pollution in the past, meaning many citizens have respiratory diseases.\nBoth Péloquin and the hospital foundation are afraid that doctors may abandon or avoid the hospital because it doesn't have a bronchoscope, which has become a basic diagnostic tool, they say.\nAre 24/7 visiting hours at Quebec hospitals on the horizon?
