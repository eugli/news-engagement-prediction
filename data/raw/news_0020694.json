External Link: Health insurance premium rises compared with inflation since 2010 \nMembers of the insurance industry said the increase was necessary to ensure health funds stayed ahead of rising health costs. \n\"Health sector costs are rising faster than CPI inflation and key components of health inflation such as the cost of medical devices are beyond the control of health funds,\" Private Healthcare Australia chief executive Rachel David said in a statement. \n\"Health funds, other private sector stakeholders like hospitals and medical specialists need to work with Australian governments to keep input cost down and bend the relentless upward curve of health inflation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:12:17.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
