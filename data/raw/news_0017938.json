Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr shows off her Venus dimples. They are difficult to achieve through exercise as they're located where the two pelvic bones connect Kimberley Garner ensures her Venus dimples are on show in a backless number on the red carpet. Now, women who aren't naturally blessed are going in search of a cosmetic solution 'The lower back has always been championed as a beautiful region of the female body,' she added. Dr Amanda Wong-Powell offers 'V-Spot' treatment to create the illusion of dimples 'However, with the rise of aesthetic surgery of the buttocks, many people are realizing that lifted buttocks only look good if paired with a sexy sculpted lower back - one fails to look good without the other.' Priced from Â£4,900, the treatment sculpts a diamond shape and two dimples into the back during VASER liposuction. 'The procedure is not painful,' said Dr Wong-Powell. 'But afterwards, in the first couple of days, you will experience aching that can be relieved by simple analgesics. She says: 'VASER liposuction uses sound energy and is selective, so it only breaks down the fat and not the surrounding tissues and vessels - hence it involves less down-time and less trauma than traditional liposuction.' HOW THE V-SPOT IS CREATED The procedure takes between one and two hours and is carried out under local anaesthetic. 'Using a short cannula (like a pencil) through a small incision less than 1cm across, the vibration and heat helps break down the fat from inside, and a suction cannula is then used to absorb the fat and sculpt the V spot area and dimples,' Dr Wong-Powell says. 'The result enhances the look of your back and buttocks.' The procedure has a recovery time of around 10 days, and patients are advised to wear a compression garment to decrease the swelling for up to six weeks following the procedure. The resulting venus dimples can be seen from as early as four weeks, but it can take up to 3 months to see the final effect. Seen on the likes of Victoria's Secret Angels (Izabel Goulart, left, and Adriana Lima, right) the small 'dimples' seen on the lower back have become somewhat of a trend.
