(702 ABC Sydney: John Donegan) \nBut Clean Up Australia founder and round-the-world yachtsman Ian Kiernan has urged the regulators to enforce minimum moorings. \n\"We've got to realise that Sydney Harbour or any of our waterways are not parking lots,\" he told ABC Radio Sydney . \n\"We have adequate marinas where you pay to store your boats and that's OK, but we're seeing the filling up of the harbour with boats that aren't really being used. \n\"It's just a storage area. It shouldn't be allowed.\" How boat moorings are managed \nRMS stipulates that a vessel cannot be \"absent from its mooring for more than 28 consecutive days\" and \"must be visually suitable for the bay and be maintained in a seaworthy condition, which means being capable of undertaking a voyage\". \nVessels are visually assessed by RMS before mooring licences are granted. Visual suitability for mooring Vessels must not show temporary repairs that are visually obvious. Vessels must be kept clean and tidy. Vessels must be kept free of bird droppings, vermin and insects. Vessels must not be used as a repository for garbage. Painted substances must not be peeling or deteriorated. Metal surfaces must be kept free from rust. Marine growth on the vessel's hull must be kept to a standard acceptable to Roads and Maritime Services. Source: Roads and Maritime Services \nHowever, Michael Lapin, a marine surveyor and manager of a commercial boat shed in Middle Harbour, said the harbour was \"not policed\" as RMS boating officers were \"overworked as there are so many boats to look at\". \n\"The boats are not maintained so they become a liability because they won't function,\" Mr Lapin said. \n\"They sink at the mooring or need to be towed ... they look ugly because they're a mess, they're like a derelict house. \n\"When they start leaking, there's always oil and contaminants in the bilges. \n\"If the boat sinks, then the fuel tank just leaks raw fuels in the environment.\" \nAn RMS spokesperson said the department was the \"appropriate regularity authority for potential environmental hazards presented by sunken vessels\". \n\"While these situations are monitored closely to assess potential environmental risks, it is the responsibility of the boat owner to remove a vessel which sinks at its mooring,\" the spokesperson said. \nGiven insurers often require vessels to have an out-of-water inspection every five years, Mr Lapin suggested mooring licences should be linked to insurance approvals.
