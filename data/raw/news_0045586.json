I thought to myself what went wrong in the cause of the game but it’s part of the game. \n“I have been with the team for over two years now and I have also been the number one man for the team. The error put me off balance but I tried controlling my emotions on the field. Chizoba Ndukwe \n“I heard so many complains from the fans as regards my error after the game but I wasn’t just myself. \n“I also want to use this opportunity to appreciate my coach, Fatai Osho, his words of encouragement has really assisted me to overcome the thoughts of my error. \n“I have learnt my mistakes. I know by the grace of God, I won’t make such mistakes again. One thing is to make mistakes, the other is to correct the mistakes immediately and never allow it to happen again. \n“My fans aren’t happy with me but I am pleading with the fans not to be angry with me and I promise it won’t happen again. All I need from you all are your prayers and support,” Ndukwe told his club’s media team. \nNdukwe and his Remo Stars team-mates are preparing to make the short trip to Ibadan where they will face Shooting Stars Sports Club in a southwest derby this Saturday. \nNPFL ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:18:34.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
