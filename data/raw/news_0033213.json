Yates and a senior career national security official to the White House counsel, was prompted by concerns that Flynn, when asked about his calls and texts with the Russian diplomat, had told Vice President-elect Mike Pence and others that he had not discussed the Obama administration sanctions on Russia for its interference in the 2016 election, the officials said. It is unclear what the White House counsel, Donald McGahn, did with the information.

Clapper Jr., who was the director of national intelligence, and John Brennan, the CIA director at the time, shared Yates' concerns and concurred with her recommendation to inform the Trump White House. They feared that \"Flynn had put himself in a compromising position\" and thought that Pence had a right to know that he had been misled, according to one of the officials, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. \nA senior Trump administration official said that the White House was aware of the matter, adding that \"we've been working on this for weeks.\" Related Content Trump's security adviser in trouble over calls to Russian envoy \nThe current and former officials said that although they believed that Pence was misled about the contents of Flynn's communications with the Russian ambassador, they couldn't rule out that Flynn was acting with the knowledge of others in the transition. \nThe FBI, Yates, Clapper and Brennan declined to comment on the matter.

One day after the interview, Flynn revised his account, telling The Post through a spokesman that he \"couldn't be certain that the topic never came up.\" \nTwo officials said a main topic of the relevant call was the sanctions.
