It also says Trump — called “Donadl Trump” in the text — met the Yanukovych associate in June 2012. \nThree FBI inquiries into Russian election hacking \nIt threatens to expose this information to the FBI and to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine. \n“Considering all the facts and evidence that are in my possession, and before possible decision whether to pass this to NABU or FBI I would like to get your opinion on this and maybe your way to work things out that will persuade me to do otherwise,” the text says.

He did, though, deny putting together the alleged 2012 meeting, and said he wasn’t working with Trump then. \nLeshchenko categorically denied the texts and said he had “nothing to do” with them. \nThe White House did not directly comment on the texts but said the timeline could not work, but Trump and Manafort did not work together until 2016. \nThe texts first surfaced weeks ago in an anonymous post on a dark website. \nManafort was the first of three people tied to Trump’s political career to lose his job over ties or interactions with Russia. He resigned in August amidst investigations into his lobbying in Ukraine for pro-Russian interests. Manafort is now under investigation by the FBI, CIA and NSA. \nFormer foreign policy advisor Carter Page and White House national security advisor Michael Flynn later left Trump’s team over Russian relations. \nTrump continues to face scrutiny for his apparent support of Russia, though he denies having any political or financial ties to the country.
