LAWRENCE SMITH/FAIRFAX NZ \nStudent Ashe Ranai faces deportation to India, husband Vikram Salaria and daughter Khwahish share her plight. \n\"It's a symbolic sanctuary, we're not going to resist if police and immigration come and try to deport them, but to try and draw attention to their plight,\" Nelson said. \n\"They're all out of appeals to immigration, this is an appeal to the court of the public. \n\"Hopefully Kiwis will see the injustice here and speak out,\" Nelson said. \nHusband and wife Vikram and Ranai and Nelson said Immigration New Zealand and the Government need to stop blaming the innocent students and take responsibility for the situation they helped create. Ad Feedback \nBut on Friday Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse denied the students were victims. \nAnyone who submitted a visa application was responsible for ensuring information supplied was correct - no matter who filled it out. \nBut the Indian students, including Vikram and Ranai who paid more than $50,000 for visas through their Indian immigration agent, said Immigration New Zealand failed to vet the applications that the couple's agent assured them he would complete properly. \nHowever \"the students are primarily from agricultural regions, they don't have the knowledge or sophistication to evaluate [visa documents], they go see their agent and sign,\" Nelson said. \n\"New Zealand advertised in India 'what a wonderful place it is to come and study', we've offered training to these [Indian] immigration agents but we don't monitor them. \nVikram said: \"We are innocent, we didn't do anything wrong, if we did fraud why did they give us a visa?\" \n\"[Immigration New Zealand] had 27 days to check our documents ,\" Ashe said. \nThe couple, both from rural Punjab in northern India, now face long-term consequences including humiliation if Ashe is deported home. \n\"I can't imagine how we're going to go back and face our parents,\" Vikram said. \n\"It's a shameful thing and if your passport is stamped with deportation you can't apply [to any country] for any job, in India as well, even my daughter's future is stopped,\" Ashe said. \nWhen asked about their future the couple slump in their seats in the church office. \nVikram answers: \"We don't have any future, we can't talk about life now, we spent a lot and now we've got nothing.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:33:41.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
