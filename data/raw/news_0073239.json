(Mike Isaacs / Pioneer Press) Mike Isaacs Village Board approved two measures and introduced a third Tuesday that officials say make up the village's new Comprehensive Immigrants' Rights Action. It comes in the wake of controversy over presidential executive orders intended to restrict immigration.\n\"In recent weeks, regardless of our political affiliations, we have come to reflect upon and identify a need within our Skokie immigrant population to allay recent fears in their already difficult lives,\" said village attorney Michael Lorge. \nLorge said Skokie not only wanted legislation mirroring sanctuary city laws in other communities but to go beyond that. In creating the three actions, he said, the village conferred with community members, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights and some state legislators. \nThe Village Board approved a resolution making Skokie the first municipality in the state to support Illinois House Bill 426, which calls for immigration safe zones at health care facilities, schools and universities, and House Bill 3099, Lorge said. \nHB 3099 limits local police involvement in federal immigration enforcement, according to the text of the proposed legislation. \nState Rep. Robyn Gabel , D-Evanston, is a co-sponsor of each bill. \nA second board-approved measure calls for Skokie to take part in supporting pending federal lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's immigration executive orders. Lorge said the legal theory behind two federal briefs concerns \"the harm to public interest\" that would result from the executive orders. (Mike Isaacs) \nThen at the March 6 village board meeting, trustees are scheduled to vote on an amendment to Skokie's human relations code, what Lorge called \"perhaps the pinnacle part\" of the package. \nAccording to Lorge, the amendment includes the \"critical concepts and principles\" around other legislation on sanctuary cities and villages, which commonly refers to a community's protection of undocumented immigrants — even against federal immigration authorities. \nIn crafting the package of immigration actions, officials said, the village reached out to Habeeb Quadri, principal of MCC Academy, which has campuses in Morton Grove and Skokie; Fred Tsao from Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights; and Rabbi Michael Weinberg from Temple Beth Israel in Skokie. \nQuadri said Tuesday that the village's actions are not about immigrant rights but human rights. \nOther leaders echoes similar sentiments. \n\"This is a very perilous time for immigrant and refugee communities throughout our country,\" Tsao said. \"There's a lot of anxiety out there. There's a lot of concern among families about the prospect of separation.\" \nThree Holocaust survivors representing the survivor community at the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center spoke out Thursday against President Trump 's Jan 27 executive order restricting immigration to the United States from predominantly-Muslim countries. \nIn a press conference at the ... \nThree Holocaust survivors representing the survivor community at the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center spoke out Thursday against President Trump 's Jan 27 executive order restricting immigration to the United States from predominantly-Muslim countries. \nIn a press conference at the ... (Mike Isaacs) \nThe village's legislation sets \"a really strong example for other communities throughout the Chicago region and really throughout the state and throughout the county,\" he said. \nWeinberg said he applauded Skokie for \"speaking up and for speaking out and for taking real and tangible actions in support of human rights — specifically as those rights apply to the most vulnerable members of our community.\" \nSkokie's Comprehensive Immigrants' Rights Action comes only weeks after residents, some saying they were from a newly-formed group called Skokie Citizens For Action, publicly advocated that the village adopt sanctuary status legislation. \nAmong the more than three dozen people in the audience Tuesday, those who spoke supported the village's actions and said they were proud to be connected to Skokie. \n\"My father has passed away as have both my parents,\" said Inhe Choi, who identified herself as an immigrant from Seoul who moved to Skokie at age 12. \"But I know he would be proud.\" \nResident Brian Williams said the village's legislation allows people to be more engaged in diversity and feel safe and trust their neighbors. \nJosina Morita, who identified herself as a sixth generation Chinese American and fifth generation Japanese American, said villages and other government will have to be on the front lines in protecting immigrants now. \n\"I'm really proud that our village is doing that,\" she said. \nSkokie Mayor George Van Dusen has said that Skokie's policy is to never inquire about immigration status. \nVan Dusen said some Skokie residents are now \"truly petrified\" because of what has occurred nationally. \n\"I've heard from residents of all manners of faith and race, from all over,\" he said. \nHe called the village \"maybe the most diverse city in the state\" and said Skokie encourages diversity. \nTrustee Randy Roberts urged people to read the ordinance that may be the subject of a final vote next month. \n\"I know from my personal contacts there are many people in Skokie that live in fear,\" Roberts said. \"They're very anxious. I think one of the best ways to combat that is to read the information.\" \n@SKReview_Mike", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:45:04.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
