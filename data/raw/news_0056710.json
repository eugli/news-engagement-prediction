Cuomo promises to fight rollback of Affordable Care Act at health care rally in the Bronx Cuomo promises to fight for health care in N.Y. at Bronx rally NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  56 PM \nGov. Cuomo joined with hospital workers, labor leaders and elected officials in the Bronx Wednesday to rally for affordable health care for New Yorkers. \nBacked by health care and hospital workers from 1199 SEIU, Cuomo said he was determined to fight the Republican rollback of the Affordable Care Act. \n“We say that healthcare is a human right and it doesn't depend on whether you're rich or whether you're poor — or where you live, you demand and you deserve quality affordable healthcare as a human,” Cuomo said. \n“Six million New Yorkers who are now insured lose their insurance ... that's one out of every six New Yorkers ... we're not going back,” he vowed. \nObamacare repeal could cost 32 million people health care: study \nCuomo made his comments at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, telling the audience about his plan to protect quality healthcare in the Empire State — which includes an $50 million investment in healthcare over the next year. \n1199 Service Employees International Union head George Gresham also spoke at the rally — along with executives from New York hospitals. \nMuch-needed funding for facilities such as Montefiore Medical Center is at risk due to the national efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Gresham and others said.
