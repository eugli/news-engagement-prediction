Based on her experiences growing up in the city of Nizhny Novgorod with her sister Oksana, who has both autism and cerebral palsy, Vodianova founded the Naked Heart Foundation, a philanthropic organization for children with special needs, in 2004 . Since then, the Naked Heart Foundation has built more than 170 play facilities in Russia, brought specialized technology to schools, created support centers, and has been active in changing the stigmatized attitudes toward those with disabilities in Russia. And of course, for the third time, Vodianova will be hosting her annual Fabulous Fund Fair tonight in London. The over-the-top charitable bash typically includes a star-studded RSVP list with attendees like Karlie Kloss, Pat McGrath, and Natasha Poly, and all the proceeds go to the Naked Heart Foundation.

Her Fabulous Fund Fair look is always cheerful—as well as easy to wear . “It has to be comfortable to wear because I am a host, because I have to move a lot,” says Vodianova over the phone. “I remember last year, I actually had to take my shoes off by the hotel because I couldn’t walk! I was so exhausted. I was so tired. But during the event, I don’t notice any pain or anything. Of course, you get tired; I’m so distracted by the guests and everything that goes on, I work on pure adrenaline.” (Mind you, on the same day of the event, Vodianova will be flying in from Moscow, where she is scheduled to speak to the Russian government alongside the chairman of the Special Olympics.) And to aid her during the whistle-stop flight? Her supermodel-style packing list is short but necessary. “Eye patches and lots of vitamins!” she says, jokingly adding, “I don't know, whatever is the opposite of a tranquilizer.” Vodianova also notes that what she will be wearing in Moscow will change when she lands in London, a common occurrence that happens when she bounces from city to city. In New York, she prefers to keep her look simple. “You have to dress down or you’ll look ridiculous,” she says. As for her preferred style in Paris and Moscow? “I dress up a little bit more. I put on more color, [make] more fashion statements, and make it more fun,” she says. Nonetheless, she reserves her most special looks for London. “London is a little bit of both. You can wear whatever you want. It’s funkier,” she says. “You can wear polka dots and stripes. It’s very ‘Fund Fair!’ ” Turns out, dressing up for a good cause makes a look even more chic.
