Courtesy of the author. I have a photograph of my family taken in Los Angeles sometime after World War II. It is, at first glance, an unremarkable studio portrait of an American family. They are wearing their best clothing — pinstriped suits, a dress with a curlicue pattern, a carnation pinned on a lapel — and are posed in the symmetrical rows typical to these kinds of shots, arms held by their sides, their hands folded neatly into their laps. A closer inspection, though, reveals each face animated by a distinctive search to settle into an expression: Mouths curve into pursed, labored smiles. Jaws tense and eyes brighten. It looks strained. My grandfather, Tsugio Ojiri, stands in the center of the back row. My grandmother, Mitzuko, in a shirt dress and loafers, sits in the left corner. My mother, born in 1943 in a prison camp in rural Arkansas, is next to her, relaying the impassive expression that she would later bring into so many photos taken of her. Below, her little sister gives a curious, sidelong glance into the camera. The barely-visible seal embossed in the corner marks the studio of Toyo Miyatake, a portraitist whose photos of young Japanese-American prisoners peering through barbed wire would later become among the most iconic photos of this section of American history. Photos like these — all found in my grandparents’s home, after their deaths — are one of the few inroads I have to construct the story of what happened to my family during and after World War II. In the portrait, taken less than a decade after they were released from the prison camps that held them from 1942-1945, I see evidence of their efforts — each subtle and unalike — to pick up the pieces. This past weekend marked the 75th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066. Issued in the wake of the attacks on Pearl Harbor, the order led to the U.S. government forcibly relocating many persons of Japanese descent living in designated military zones on the West Coast. More than 110,000 Japanese-Americans — roughly two-thirds of whom were U.S. citizens — were taken without charge or trial to concentration camps in remote public lands across the U.S. Many, like my grandparents, had to sell their homes and property within a matter of weeks, bringing only what they could carry. A Day of Remembrance of this history was held on Saturday afternoon in New York, beginning with a march past Trump Tower. Former Japanese-American prisoners, their families, and allies wore garb reminiscent of the 1940s and carried signs stating, “I am a U.S. Concentration Camp Survivor” and “9066 #NeverAgain.” In the second half of the commemoration, a series of speakers addressed a crowd at the Japanese American United Church on Seventh Avenue, a forum to testify to an under-examined period of American history that, more than ever, has a dark resonance to our political present. For some Japanese-Americans, witnessing the surge of hate crimes against Muslim Americans after the election and the recent travel ban has been a “horrific” reminder of what happened to them during World War II. In her speech to the church, Theodora “Teddy” Yoshikami, who was born in Tule Lake, one of the ten prison camps that operated during the war, said, “It just brings up all of the memories of our Japanese American past history.” Pundits and politicians have already ominously mobilized the history as a rationale for burgeoning anti-Muslim policies. In an interview from 2015 , now-President Donald Trump explained while he “certainly [hates] the concept” of the Japanese incarceration, he would have “had to be there at the time to tell you, to give you a proper answer.” Carl Higbie suggested on Megyn Kelly’s Fox News show that the Japanese-American prison camps might serve as a “precedent” for a registration of American Muslims. “This is the time we hoped would never come again,” said Mike Ishii, one of the day’s organizers. “But we are here.” A scene from New York's Day of Remembrance, 2017. Photograph by Cathlin Goulding. The Day of Remembrance highlighted the implications of this history for citizens living in a liberal democracy that does not often operate in accordance to its stated principles. Vincent Warren, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, noted that the constitution did not originally provision rights and protections beyond white men. It is a document that has and continues to be tested, whether it be in 1942 or 2017. “The constitution is actually not the thing that protects us,” he said to the crowd. “We are the thing that protects us.” The role of events like the Day of Remembrance is to instill a robust wariness of the extensions of state power and to sharpen our critical analysis of our failures to act against them. Since 9/11, Japanese-Americans have forged alliances with Muslim communities, our history obliging us to counter policies of surveillance and detention deployed against Muslim communities. Ishii explained that surviving the camps gives a kind of “moral authority” to our community. Japanese-American organizations and institutions act, he said, as “watchdogs, so that no other community will be subjected to violation of human and civil rights.” Citing his own experience being targeted by the CIA at a 9/11 memorial service, Imam Khalid Latif, a university chaplain for New York University and a chaplain for the NYPD, urged the crowd to continue to hold such cross-cultural events. “We have to leverage everything that our communities have to be able to take on these institutional mechanisms with a sound sense of strategy,” he said. The day concluded with a candle lighting ceremony, an opportunity to speak the name of these prisons aloud and to honor the families that survived them. The organizers asked audience members who felt compelled to come to the front of the church and hold a sign and a candle, one for each of the camps and other sites of incarceration: Manzanar. Gila River. Jerome. Tule Lake. Poston. Topaz. Granada. Minidoka. Heart Mountain. Rohwer. Only a small portion of those on the stage are those who were actually in the camps; most are those born in its aftermath, who, despite not having experienced it first time, have inherited the history and seek to continue to share it. During the event, the audience spoke aloud the names of those they knew in the camps. Behind me, a woman and her young daughter whispered to one another. A woman holding a candle on the stage wiped her eyes. As I watched the scene in the church, all of the tiny lights and placards, I am reminded of my family photo, taken so many years ago. This scene offers a very different kind of portraiture, a different symmetry: I do not see the same melancholy adjustments of the face, the complex attunements and acceptance of leaving behind the past in order to forge ahead. Rather, on this day, there is a kind of activation in the room, an undertaking of the work ahead of us. As Ishii noted during his speech: “This is the time to be the allies that we needed during World War II.” Recommended For You ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:42:00.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
