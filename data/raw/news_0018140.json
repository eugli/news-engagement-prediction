Sasikala is treating us like how (late Chief Minister J) Jayalalithaa treated us,\" said one of them, Murugumaran. \n\"We are not birds being kept in a cage,\" added another legislator. \nThey accused the DMK of spreading rumours that legislators backing Sasikala against acting Chief Minister O Panneerselvam were being held hostage. \nMeanwhile, AIADMK spokesperson CR Saraswathi, who is not a legislator, addressed the media and said she had to switch off her mobile phone as there were lots of threatening calls. \nShe further said that no one can stop Chinamma, as Sasikala is fondly called, from becoming the Tamil Nadu CM. \nShe added that they were just awaiting good news from Tamil Nadu Governor Vidyasagar Rao. \nAfter attending a meeting at the AIADMK headquarters on Wednesday, the pro-Sasikala MLAs were bussed to a beach resort near Chennai. \nOn Thursday, responding to a habeas corpus petition filed in the Madras High Court, the Tamil Nadu government advocate said the legislators were free. \n(With IANS inputs) First Published: Friday, February 10, 2017 - 14:32 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T11:50:19.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
