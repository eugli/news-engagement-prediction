Read more \nThe 37-year-old told the Sun on Sunday he suspected he had been viewed with suspicion because of his travel to Iraq and his appearance. \nHe said: \"I felt humiliated. I think they held me because my passport showed I had been to Iraq. \n\"Maybe I am a bit Asian-looking but that doesn't mean I should be treated with the same suspicion as a terrorist.

It was the worst travel experience of my life.\" \nBeharry said he witnessed \"Middle Eastern-looking passengers\" being pulled aside by officials enforcing the president's controversial executive order. \nThe move, which was promised by Mr Trump on the campaign trail, sparked widespread condemnation at home and around the world. \nMr Trump has since been locked in a legal battle over the legitimacy of the temporary ban, which restricts travel to the US from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq. \nOn Friday a judge in Seattle temporarily blocked enforcement of the ban, and the Department of Justice filed a notice on Saturday to appeal against the ruling in court.
