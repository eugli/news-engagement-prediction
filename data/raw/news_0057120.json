But city officials later said Smith was escorted from the building by unspecified city personnel who do not work in law enforcement.\nChannel 2's Dave Huddleston reports. The move by investigators comes amid a probe by the feds into a bribery scheme involving city of Atlanta contracts.\nThe feds have said a pair of contractors paid more than $1 million in bribes in exchange for city contracts , though it’s not clear if Tuesday’s actions and the broader investigation are connected.\nSo far, two Atlanta area contractors — Elvin “E.R.” Mitchell Jr. and Charles P. Richards Jr. — have pleaded guilty to paying bribes to an unnamed person under the belief the money would flow to one or more Atlanta officials with influence over city contracts.\nAJC business reporter Scott Trubey walks us through the room where the 1.4 million pages released in the Atlanta city hall bribery case are being held. What is he finding? A lot of blank pages. www.accessatlanta.com Prosecutors say the two contractors won millions of dollars in city business as part of the scheme and they have agreed to testify in exchange for leniency. The U.S. Attorney’s Office has said the Atlanta scheme occurred from 2010 to 2015.\nReturn to AJC.com for updates.", "external_links": ["http://www.myajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/key-figure-atlanta-bribery-probe-pleads-guilty/mY95FG4N5uOoBzlPZxh1MO/", "http://www.myajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/atlanta-axes-top-purchasing-officer-feds-seize-items-from-his-office/UpGpKTqrgHFvMNLFPpx1MP/"], "published": "2017-02-21T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:34:32.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
