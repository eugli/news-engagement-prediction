The central bank signalled that there would be fewer interest rate cuts going ahead, causing bond prices to tumble and in turn leading to erosion in values of long-term debt mutual fund schemes. \n\nBond prices and yields move in opposite direction; when prices rise, yields fall and vice-versa. \n\n“Tax-free bond yields, which stood at 5.9% prior to the monetary policy , rose to 6-6.15%. This is an attractive bet for investors,“ said Vikram Dalal, managing director at Synergee Capital. For example, the NHAI ­ N6, which carries a coupon of 8.75% and matures in Feb 2029, now trades at Rs 1,307, offering a yield of 6.04%. Similarly , IRFC-NE, which carries a coupon of 8.88% and trades at Rs 1,302 maturing in March 2029, now yields 6.15%. \n\nWith the RBI changing its chance from accommodative to neutral, indicating that chances of a rate cut are low, bond yields rose by 37 basis points in a span of three days after the monetary policy . \n\nFinancial planners point out that tax-free bonds are far attractive when compared to bank fixed deposits . While a fixed deposit from State Bank of India gives you an interest of 6.75% per annum, which translates into a post-tax return of 4.66% for those in the highest tax bracket, tax-free bonds give 6-6.15%. Also, tax-free bonds enjoy easy liquidity as they are listed on the stock exchanges. \n\nAnother aspect which works in favour of tax-free bonds is the lim ited supply available in the market. “The Union Budget did not announce any issuance of tax-free bonds in this financial year, which will cap fresh supply in the primary markets . Hence investors have no other option to buy these bonds other than from the secondary market ,“ said Anup Bhaiya, managing director, Money Honey Financial Services. \n\nTax-free bonds were issued in the financial years 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 with tenures of 10, 15 and 20 years, respectively. \n\nAll the companies, which raised these bonds, are well managed PSUs, enjoying 'AAA' ratings. Issuers like NHAI, NHB, NTPC , PFC, IRFC, HUDCO and several others raised money through taxfree bonds. These bonds pay halfyearly interest and do not have any put or call options.
