His 18-year-old daughter, Bindi, marked the emotional occasion with a touching photo on Instagram . \"Always in our hearts,\" she captioned the sweet shot, which shows her father smiling alongside a cockatoo. Steve was in the midst of filming the documentary series Ocean's Deadliest off the coast of Australia in 2006 when he was fatally attacked by a stingray, but his tragic death hasn't marred the enduring legacy of wildlife conservation that he shared with the world. Both Bindi and her younger brother, Robert, have followed in their father's footsteps, feeding crocodiles at the Australia Zoo owned by their family and appearing on The Tonight Show with a whole bunch of animals.
