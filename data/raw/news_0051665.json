Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nCash Me Ousside girl Danielle Bregoli has accused Kylie Jenner of trying to seek attention \"so bad\". \nYes, the girl who is famous for nothing - apart from appearing on US show Dr. Phil - took aim at the youngest Kardashian-Jenner sister this week. \nDeclaring war on the teen, the 13-year-old told radio station Power 106 : “I don’t like her. Like the way that she does s**t, like urgh… It seems like she wants attention so bad. Like little b**ch would do anything.” \nShe continued: “How do you go from f**king lips the size of a twig and a body that looks like a f**king paperclip and now you look like a hourglass? Like man, what the f**k?!” Kylie Jenner, Tyga (Photo: Splash News) Kylie Jenner, Alexander Wang show, Fall Winter 2017, New York Fashion Week (Photo: Rex Features) Danielle first appeared on Dr. Phil last year (Photo: REUTERS/Twitter) \nClearly not worried about what Kylie thinks, Danielle continued: \"B**ch come meet me at the Roosevelt. Wassup? I'm right here.\" \nAnd not content with just taking aim at Kylie, she then got into a war of words - unclear what about - with Soulja Boy, 26, on Twitter.
