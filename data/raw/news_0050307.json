We went to see a doctor and as soon as you've spoken someone things start to look up. \nUnlike Ben, 29-year-old James Henry didn't realise that he was suffering with depression until it was over. \n\"I did have suicidal thoughts at my worst,\" he tells Newsbeat. \n\"It nearly broke my marriage and it would've done if my wife wasn't so strong.\" \nJames advises other new dads not to shrug off sudden changes in the way they feel. \n\"I turned to alcohol to cope and I'm not usually a drinker. \n\"I would also get wound up about things it wasn't worth getting wound up about,\" he said. \nPostnatal depression affected both dads in different ways but they have similar advice for others. \nSupport of their friends and family helped them cope. \n\"I had a couple of moments when people said it was all in my head but that doesn't help, you want positive reactions instead of people saying that it'll soon be gone,\" Ben says. \n\"It takes time - just stick with it and go to see a doctor as soon as you can, a weight will be lifted off your shoulders as soon as you talk to someone.\" \nAnd although James didn't go and see a doctor, he urges others to do so. \n\"My message to everyone else is simple - don't suffer like I did, seek medical advice and tell someone. \n\"I hope that because I've spoken out people will realise that it isn't only women that suffer from postnatal depression.\" \nThere's support and help on depression via these BBC Advice pages. \nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T11:31:30.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
