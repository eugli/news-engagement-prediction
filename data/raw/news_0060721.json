They would sit, have a cigarette, have a few drinks and pay their tab and leave.” Read more Kansas City shooting: Attacker an alcoholic, got a drink to ‘unwind’ after crime \nThe 51-year-old alleged shooter was charged on Thursday. A third man, local Ian Grillot, who was injured as he tried to stop Purinton, is in hospital. \nBohnen, who was leaving the bar as Kuchibhotla and Madasani walked in, said all four were regulars at the Austins Bar and Grill. \n“Ian’s a really good guy,” Bohnen told The Kansas City Star. “He’s been going there forever. We’ve always had a good time with him. He’s always one to diffuse stuff.” \nAnd that’s exactly what Grillot, 24, did on Wednesday.

He was then told to leave the bar, but he returned, shouted “get out of my country” and “terrorist” before shooting them. \nGrillot ducked behind a table and when he thought the gunman was out of bullets, he lunged at him. But as the Kansas City Star reported, Purinton had still one round left and shot Grillot through the arm and chest. \n“From what I understand when he was throwing racial slurs at the two gentlemen (Kuchibhotla and Madasani), Ian stood up for them,” Bohnen said. “We’re all proud of him.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:20:51.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
