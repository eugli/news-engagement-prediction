Everyone knows he is an angry man.” \nThe post triggered an outpouring of concern for the three-time Olympic gold medallist, whose father Nev says is battling “a medical problem.” \nHackett is reportedly being treated in hospital following his arrest, with his brother Craig describing the retired swimming great as a danger to himself and the community. A post shared by Grant Hackett (@grant__hackett) on Feb 15, 2017 at 2:03pm PST \nHackett was arrested at his parents’ house on the Gold Coast on Wednesday after family members called police. \nThe 36-year-old was arrested on Wednesday afternoon and driven to the Southport watch house in handcuffs. \nA Queensland Police spokesman confirmed Hackett had been arrested at a home at Surfer’s Avenue, Mermaid Waters following reports of a disturbance. \nHe was released without charge about three hours later and admitted to waiting media that he was “not great.” \nHackett’s father Nev, a former policeman, called police to the address because his son was in an agitated state and apparently intoxicated. \n“Grant’s got a medical problem and it manifested itself here this morning ... he was raving and ranting a bit,” Nev Hackett told The Gold Coast Bulletin .
