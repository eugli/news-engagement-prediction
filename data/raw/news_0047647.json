Trump has said he considers the border a sieve and if you're a border security person you're going to take that signal,\" he said.

The US Congress passed its own version of the bill in December. \nThe US immigration preclearance operations have had in Canada for decades - an example of the deep co-operation between the two countries on border matters. The system allows travellers to conveniently pass through American customs sites set up in Canada and for the US to vet people before they set foot on US soil. \nBut lawyers are concerned about the powers Bill C-23, which will supersede the existing agreement, would give US border agents operating in Canada. \nToronto-based immigration lawyer Howard Greenberg says he worries the legislation contains provisions that might hinder the legal rights and freedoms of Canadian citizens. \nAmong the red flags Mr Greenberg sees in the bill are provisions that would allow American customs officials to detain and question people, to perform body searches on travellers, and to require people who wanted to withdraw from pre-clearance interviews to give a reason. \nCurrently a traveller has the right to leave the preclearance area with no consequence. \n\"You head for the curb, take a taxi home,\" said Mr Greenberg. \nIt would also allow US border agents to carry firearms and \"restraint devices\" at preclearance sites. Image copyright AP \nPublic safety officials note that preclearance officers cannot place anyone under arrest, that they must operate in accordance with Canadian law, and that no right or power is conferred on border officers of one country and not the other. \nThey also say that allowing border agents to question people withdrawing from a preclearance area is necessary to avoid illicit \"probing\" of those sites by those who may be trying to detect weak points or deficiencies. \nBut Mr Greenberg says the bill, which still has time to be amended, needs to do more to clarify the rights of Canadians on Canadian soil, especially when a US administration talks about \"extreme vetting\" of migrants and refugees. \nOttawa is also under growing pressure to suspend the Safe Third Country Agreement amid increasing numbers of refugee claimants crossing illegally into Canada in Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia. \nThat pact with the US states that refugee claimants are required to request protection in the first safe country they arrive in - a policy meant to better manage refugee claims and to avoid so-called \"asylum shopping\" between countries. \nBut it is also driving asylum seekers to make the illegal crossing to avoid being turned back to the US at official ports of entry. \nMore than 200 Canadian lawyers recently sent a letter calling on the Trudeau government to suspend the pact following Mr Trump's election. \nRepresentatives from the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic also wrote to the Liberal government this month asking for them to consider the \"enforcement and implementation\" of the STCA. \nSo far, the federal government is standing behind the agreement, which came into effect in 2004, saying the conditions of the agreement continue to be met.
