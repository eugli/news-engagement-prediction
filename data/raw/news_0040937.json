You handled that rather well, but do you know your European club badges as well? How many clubs can you correctly identify when the list of possible teams is much greater and many of the badges will be less familiar?

We've selected badges from across the biggest football countries such as Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Holland and Portugal.
