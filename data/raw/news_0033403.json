Share via Twitter Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic/Getty Images There was plenty of head-turning fashion on the 2017 Grammy Awards red carpet. From a \" Make America Great Again \" dress to a gum ball machine-inspired gown, the sartorial choices at this year's Grammy Awards left people with plenty to talk about. But alternative rock group Twenty One Pilots managed to steal the style spotlight with a bold fashion choice of their own. The musical duo dropped their pants at the beginning of the awards show—leaving many (including us) confused. And it turns out they had an incredibly sweet reason for doing so. After Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun of Twenty One Pilots learned they won the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category for their hit \"Stressed Out\", the duo stood up and promptly took off their pants. Wearing only their boxer briefs, the pair took to the stage to accept their first Grammy win. Thankfully, they were quick to explain their reasoning for hopping on the stage in their underwear—and it dates back to their very beginnings as a musical group. \"This story starts in Columbus, Ohio,\" Joseph said.\"It was a few years ago, before Josh and I were able to make money playing music. And I called him up and said, 'Do you wanna come over to my rental house and watch the Grammys?' And he said, 'Yeah, who's hanging there?' And I said, 'a couple of my roommates just coming to watch the Grammys with us.'\" He continued: \"As we were watching, we noticed that every single one of us were in our underwear. Seriously, Josh turned to me—and we were no one at that time—and he said, 'If we ever go to the Grammys, if we ever win a Grammy, we should receive it just like this.'\" Kind of a cute—albeit creative—way to pay tribute to their beginnings, right? \"So not only is this amazing, but I want everyone who is watching at home to know that you could be next,\" Joseph said, concluding the acceptance speech on an inspiring note. \"Anyone from anywhere can do anything and this is that.\" A pretty good reason for dropping pants, we'd say.
