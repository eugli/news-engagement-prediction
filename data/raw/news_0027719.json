They soared 4.4% to 3,437 yuan, helping to propel gains in other industrial metals and bulk commodity futures during the session. \nAnd, as the daily chart of Dalian iron ore futures shows below, technical buying following a clear break above the highs struck in January may have exacerbated the gains that have been seen in recent days.

Source: Thomson Reuters \nIf you needed proof that speculative forces have taken hold in iron ore futures, this adds to a growing list. \nBuying iron ore on a technical break higher – it’s unlikely that would have been a factor to consider when price contracts were set on an annual basis only a decade ago. \nOthers suggested that renewed strength in the US dollar may have also supported futures, helping to boost demand as traders rushed to protect against potential further weakness in the Chinese yuan. \nWhile Chinese futures are priced in yuan, iron ore is commonly traded in US dollars in global markets. \nWhatever the reason behind the rally, be it fundamentals, technicals or outright speculation, it certainly helped to propel Australian mining stocks higher on Monday. \nRio Tinto was up 3.5% to $68.32 and BHP 2.2% to $26.45. And, making those gains look small, pure play iron ore miner Fortescue Metals saw its share price surge 6% to $6.88. \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
