(Chris Condon/PGA TOUR) \nNo matter how immaculate a golf course is manicured and prepared, there is a phenomenon that no grounds staff or PGA TOUR official can avoid or baby – the learning curve on new or unfamiliar greens. This isn’t to say that they’re not aware of it or even try to hide it, but entrants who take notice can prioritize their game plan accordingly. \nExcluding the last three majors of every season where the world’s best clash on a nomadic series of host tracks, we’re more likely to observe ball-strikers rising on leaderboards on other migrating tournaments (e.g. RBC Canadian Open, THE NORTHERN TRUST, BMW Championship) than a West Coast Swing staple like the Waste Management Phoenix Open at TPC Scottsdale’s Stadium Course. However, when a customary stop is redesigned, as this one was in 2014, its greens are almost always upgraded with the newest in drainage and grass. Even if one was torn apart and rebuilt exactly to spec, every green has a soul. A veteran would immediately notice and feel the difference between the original and the replica. Thus begins retraining and education of undulations and speed. \nFor the first few editions, a modernization neutralizes previous advantages of experience, which softens the blow the best putters can throw. Until separation occurs over time – and it will – the premium is on navigating TPC Scottsdale with precision and patience. This approach is widely evident in the identifiers of success in the 2016 edition of the WMPO, just the second since Tom Weiskopf updated his original collaboration with Jay Morrish.
