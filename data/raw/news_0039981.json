Lawton “Today, we are expressing our shared and deep concerns over your proposed immigration policies, including the recent Executive Order and current bills on the H-1B visa, all of which we fear will impact our ability to continue to hire freely and develop critical talent,” the letter said. The immigration order sparked widespread protests since its implementation in January. Large portions of it are currently on hold pending court challenges. A wave of tech companies, including Apple , Facebook , Microsoft and Twitter , along with D.C.-based MapBox, filed an amicus brief in a court challenge brought by Minnesota and Washington state opposing the immigration ban. On Feb. 8 three Greater Washington biotech execs added their names to 166 others in the industry opposing the ban , saying it would hinder innovation. The Berger-founded organization doesn’t have an official name yet, but it has formed committees made up of tech executives, including one to develop a mission statement and another to develop a set of shared values. Ultimately, Berger envisions an organization that puts together a pool of resources and engages in a larger organization effort. He intends to host a larger meeting on March 3. The other companies that have signed onto the letter include UrbanStems, Cava, ICX Media, Power Supply, Optoro, BroadSoft, Aquirecore and more. The group said it wants to meet with Trump to share its concerns and hopes for the future. “Help us grow together with great jobs here in the DC area and across the whole country by supporting talented individuals regardless of where they come from. We would be open to meeting with anyone from your Administration to share our concerns and hopes for job creation in the future,” the letter said. The organization now has an online survey asking people who have been affected to fill it out so they can know how they can assist. The full text of the letter appears below.
