most exciting place to eat in Europe The Spanish capital's renaissance has fuelled a blossoming culinary scene Stephen Bayley 22 February 2017 • 4:12pm \nM adrid is a city I first discovered as a student. Franco was in power (just), black widows skulked the smartest barrios and the regular taxicab from the airport was a black and chrome rococo Fiat 2300. \nBut if, like me, you went by rail, the journey could take three days. The tilting train was an eccentric design by Alejandro Goicoechea and José Luis Oriol. The Talgo (for Tren Articolado Ligero Goicoechea Oriol) made only fitful progress. I described the pleasures (hard bread rolls, jamón, wine) and pains (heat, dust and ennui) of the journey from Irun to the capital in an essay competition and won the prize of a year’s supply of Carlsberg Special. That was the first time I profited from writing – so, on the whole, I have fond feelings towards the city.

The Manzanares river, not much more than a stream, seems to serve no purpose. Madrid is the highest city in Europe and they used to say “the throne of the King of Spain is next after that of God”. Well, maybe, but not every traveller is so positive. In 1845 Richard Ford wrote: “The more Madrid is known, the less it will be liked.” Even Hemingway, who eventually fetishised the city, doubted that “anyone likes it much when he first goes there”. La Movida saw the city quickly evolve from Habsburg-inflected fascist gloom to one of the most engaging and exciting places to eat in Europe \nIt’s not an obviously pretty city – “modern, debased and feeble” according to Edward Hutton – although its attractions are profound when revealed. I have been many times since, but this latest trip was not about the Prado, the Thyssen or the Reina Sofia, nor even the Hemingway haunts. Instead, this was a long weekend devoted to the singular bar and restaurant culture that has characterised Madrid since La Movida saw the city quickly evolve from Habsburg-inflected fascist gloom to one of the most engaging and exciting places to eat in Europe. \nPartly to replicate my student journey, I started in the north-east, flying into Bilbao’s airport, a design of signature loopiness by Santiago Calatrava. And I had never seen Frank Gehry’s famous Guggenheim, so I wanted to experience at first-hand an “effect” which turned out to be as startling as promised. Bilbao got rich from exporting haematite and much of the extraction was by British businesses. My old 1930 Blue Guide shows a map with a route saying “Liverpool-Bilbao 701 miles” – not a journey one sees often nowadays. Did the iron ore connection inspire Gehry to make his metal masterpiece? I pondered this at a stand-up pintxo lunch in the splendid Bar Gatz, in a quiet street in the Casco Viejo, Bilbao’s old quarter, opposite the museum.

Between Bilbao and San Sebastian, you pass the little town of Gernika which Picasso made famous: my luxury German transport was a fine place to reflect on what more hostile German machinery had done 80 years earlier. \nThe San Sebastian train travels pitiably slowly for the first three hours on old classic 5’6” gauge track, then passes almost imperceptibly through a gauge-changer and on to speedier 4’8.5” gauge, accelerating to 155mph. Turista is one class, Preferente the other. For the five hours it takes to reach Madrid’s now very spruce Atocha station, Preferente is better. A post shared by Celso y Manolo (@celsoymanolo) on Aug 10, 2016 at 4:50am PDT \nMy first dinner was at Celso y Manolo. The cooking here is nuevo Latino: modern, clever, eclectic, but traditional too. Responsibly farmed produce is sourced from a network of rustic suppliers. There is more variety on the menu than can be grasped or eaten in one greedy evening. You could return here 10 times and never replicate your dinner. I ate empanadillas de mostoles (tuna and tomato dumplings), caracolillos (winkles: landlocked Madrid has spectacular seafood) and taquitos con salsa de queso (veal with blue cheese). Find the perfect Spain tour \nNext morning, I walked for several hours, dodging a grand military parade. I had never before been to the Café Gijon, Madrid’s Florian, its Greco, its Deux Magots: a storied focus of old Madrid where the intelligentsia met for smoky conversations called café-tertulia. Hemingway despised it. And literary historian David Gilmour said Gijon has “much character, but little charm”. I agreed and since there was no outside seating on a sunny day, but there were A-boards advertising nasty looking rice dishes, I moved on to a newer and better Madrid. \nThe Calle Ponzano is still gritty, but is acquiring a grit-changing collection of fine little bars and restaurants: “una ruta por el major tapeo” (the street with the best tapas), they say. One of them was Fide, a sophisticated chain which gloriously combines the trades of brewing and fishmongery. In Madrid, where no kitchen service is to be found before 1pm, it’s obligatory to have a small plate of anchovies and a can of beer before lunch proper. So there was also La Lianta: a no-name, stripped brick place to enjoy that unique Spanish thing of standing at a bar in the middle of Saturday with a plate of half a dozen scallops. A chef at work at Celso y Manolo \nLunch proper was at the Sala Despiece, a little further up Ponzano. As high concepts go, this is altitudinous and while it is normally wise to avoid any place where waiters have rubber boots, plastic aprons and attend to their craft with tweezers and blowtorches (while visitors have to crawl underneath the counter in an interior that looks as if Pedro Almodóvar has designed a nuclear medicine lab), it is done with such finesse and charming seriousness that absurdities are forgiven. The fanatically detailed menu – dishes are by weight, technique – is in minuscule blue biro. The indefinable cooking I described in my notebook as “industrial gastronomy”: a delaminated red mullet with hoisin and berries, perfectly cooked baby squid, burrata with green sauce… all served on metal plates. \nAs a contrast in style, dinner was at Viejo, once enjoyed by Juan Carlos but not by me. Like Lhardy (Madrid’s most famous old restaurant, on the Carrera San Jeronimo), Viejo was dead – not in the dark, sexy, interesting way in which Valdes Leal painted mortality, but in its tragic lifelessness. I rushed back to connect with life and watched, with a swaying crowd, an Atletico-Real penalty shoot-out in my hotel’s bar. 10 amazing food and wine holidays in Spain \nOn Sunday morning, Madrid’s two finest covered markets beckoned – Mercado de Cebada and Mercado San Fernando, each infinitely gloomy and with invitingly decrepit bars in their Stygian innards. Afterwards I settled into a plastic chair and an organic beer in the sunny Huerta del Rastro, a farmer’s market in the old flea market area. \nThen it was on to El Boqueron for pre-lunch. This is now my favourite bar ever, with no bread but very many tiles, forbidding hardwood chairs and little plates of astonishingly fresh, barely cooked seafood and luscious Albarino on draft. Lunch was at the very urban-chic Vaqueria Montanesa in Chamberi, a silent district of government offices and consulates. And now it was raining, so I took a cab to Toledo to share, with a group of confused-looking Koreans, El Greco’s sublime Entierro del Conde de Orgaz, one of the very greatest paintings. It’s nice to have one’s sense of awe refreshed now and again.

Dinner was at Ardosa, a teeming bar with ancient bottles crammed floor-to-ceiling, terrazzo, noise, brownness and a heaving crowd eating salmorejo (a very thick gazpacho) and drinking cold beer or classic vermouth. If you do not already have a cheerful vision of a perfect bodega, Ardosa will supply it. \nMadrid has an interesting range of new hotels. Mine was the Posada del Dragon in Calle Baja, a fine old street in La Latina, the district whose barrios most accurately replicate conventions of Bohemia. Shuttered and graffiti’d by day, by five it is roaring and at midnight deafening. Madrid's culinary scene has flourished \nThe Posada is a historic monument with rooms around vertiginous galleries above a narrow courtyard. You enter through a howling, rammed bar and restaurant. All the rooms are comfortable and decorated in the style you might call Almodóvar: a sprightly, camp postmodernism with ironic baroque details, splashes of irrational colour and panels of AstroTurf on the walls. The inner rooms have no windows and, despite Daikin ventilation and air conditioning, can be hot and claustrophobic. Ask for one with a window and you will look out on the Posada opposite with its ochre paint and ancient pantiles with some cupolas in the distance, and you will be as near the Kingdom of Heaven as the King of Spain. \nThere is something exceptional about Madrid’s bars and restaurants. Even the newer “concepts” seem more rooted, organic and real than London’s. I adore the gravidad y decoro of this city and its people. Grave and decorous indeed, but by early evening no one is without a glass of wine or beer and is dreaming dreams of anchovies or tortilla. Graveness and decorum disappear into the night.
