Logging became the primary order of business decades before the city was even officially established.\nThe history is even commemorated on a monument that sits near the Port of Vancouver on Dunlevy street.\nIt reads, \"On July 26, 1867, the vessel 'Siam' left Stamps' Mill with lumber for Australia, thus beginning Vancouver's prime function: the supply of her great timbers to the world.\"\nTracey says the mill exported over 1.2 million metres of timber in a single year. Chief among the supply was the iconic Douglas fir.\nA clearcut over what is now Denman street in the late 1800s.

[They went] all over the world because it was such a superior lumber — and it still is.\"\nTracey says the Douglas fir remains the most important timber tree in North America, utilized for construction, furniture, and even pulp.\nThe bulk of the Pacific Northwest's old growth Douglas firs are long gone, but Tracey says the fruits of their global demand remain — in the form of the cities we live in.\nAnd while a history of clear cuts might leave a sour taste in the mouths of nature-lovers, Tracey posits a simple question: where would you prefer to live?\n\"Maybe it's beautiful.
