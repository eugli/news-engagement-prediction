USA TODAY Sports Images \nMichigan basketball didn’t necessarily turn the corner with its second win over Indiana in just over two weeks, even with a 29-point win over Michigan State sandwiched in between. That’s because the Wolverines laid an egg at home against Ohio State that, for the time being, has them on the NCAA Tournament bubble. \nAnd now that we’ve seen the ceiling for this team (again) after a 75-63 win at Indiana and a beatdown of MSU, that makes it more inexcusable. \nThe team that’s show up the last two games, playing with intensity on both ends of the floor, is similar to the squad that won the 2K Classic with big wins over good Marquette and SMU teams. \nListening to IU head coach Tom Crean, however, you’d think the Wolverines had beaten his JV team twice. \n“Our screening was a joke. It was more us,” he said of the 60 points scored in a 90-60 whitewashing in Ann Arbor. “I’m sure they’ll feel good about it and all that type of stuff, but it was more us than anything else.” \nAnd of his team’s 4-for-21 three-point shooting, many of them heavily contested: \n“I'm not sure it was the Michigan defense. Maybe it was. I'm sure they'll credit themselves for it,” he said. \nNote to Crean — probably not wise to refuse the opponent credit when a good portion of your own fan base is disgruntled with you (to put it nicely). That’s three in a row for U-M now over his club going back to last year’s Big Ten Tournament, and two of them were on the Hoosiers’ turf. \nThis one was actually on their home court — U-M’s house of horrors, where the Wolverines had won only twice in the last 20 years, one of them in the mid-1990s. \nIt takes a strong leader to pull that off … enter senior point guard Derrick Walton Jr., who is quickly working his way into All-Big Ten contention (if he’s not there already). As much as fellow senior Zak Irvin has struggled the last four games (4-for-31 shooting), Walton has been that good. He’s averaging 20.4 points per game in his last eight, since Illinois called him and his teammates a “white collar” bunch. \n“Derrick Walton’s just controlling games. He’s doing a great job reading what’s going on,” head coach John Beilein said. “X [freshman Xavier Simpson] was giving great life so Mo [Muhammad Ali Abdur-Rahkman] could get his rest so he could go in and try to lock down James Blackmon.” \n“The kids are enthused about the win.” \nAs they should be, even though as Crean pointed out, the Hoosiers kind of stink under his command. But winning in that venue is no easy task, and winning anywhere on the road had been the impossible task until Saturday. \nWalton reportedly reached out to each one of his teammates before this one, knowing how critical it was. He told them last week to leave it out there for Irvin and the other Hoosier starters like they had for him against the home state Spartans. \nThey responded with an incredible defensive effort, whether Crean wanted to acknowledge it or not. Michigan went several empty possessions at the end of the first half, beginning of the second, but still maintained a solid lead. \nThe Hoosiers never cut the deficit lower than six after U-M claimed a 10-point halftime lead. \n“I’ve preached before, when the team is not making shots and the effort is still there, we’re going to win,” Walton said. “I don’t know how long it was, but we couldn’t hit a shot. I’m pretty sure we got stops. If we get stops, continually buy into that side of the ball, this season can be still special like we want it to be.” \nSpecial would be a deep run in the NCAA Tournament ... but one step at a time. Next up is Wisconsin Thursday, another team the Wolverines have struggled with historically, and a chance to prove that maybe … just maybe … they’re what we thought they could be after a New York weekend in November.
