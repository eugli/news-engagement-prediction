Steve Valk, spokesman for the Citizens' Climate Lobby , a grassroots organization that advocates for putting a price on carbon pollution, called the proposal \"an aggressive, properly designed carbon tax that employs the power of the free market to do the work is more effective and efficient than regulations.\" 2. Backers see it as politically feasible -- and popular with voters This is a strange political moment to be proposing any climate change policies. President Donald Trump erroneously has called climate change a hoax (it's real and we're causing it primarily by burning fossil fuels), and his \" America First Energy Plan \" aims to revitalize industries that contribute to dangerous warming. But Halstead told me it's becoming clear to him that the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress need plans of their own. It's not good enough just to repeal Obamacare, the thinking goes. You have to replace it, too. Similarly, climate regulations need to be replaced with something, he said. \"This is the only way I see for Republicans to have a viable and popular way to cut regulations significantly, because otherwise there will be popular backlash,\" Halstead said. \"These regulations are there for a reason.\" The polls are with him on this. Recent data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication shows nearly 80% of Americans -- and more than 60% of Trump voters -- support taxing and/or regulating carbon pollution. 3. The tax could help curb US climate pollution The Climate Leadership Council proposes repealing Obama-era climate regulations alongside passing a carbon tax. Some environmentalists certainly would take issue with removing at least some of those regulations, seeing them as compatible with the tax. But an analysis commissioned by the Climate Leadership Council says its plan would be nearly twice as effective as all Obama-era climate regulations at reducing global warming pollution. And nearly three times as effective as repealing the regulations and doing nothing else. This matters because the Earth's atmosphere isn't waiting for politics to catch up. Humans already have pumped dangerous quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, enough to warm the planet about 1 degree Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement on climate change sets the international target of limiting warming to 1.5 or at most 2 degrees Celsius. The world is not far -- perhaps only a number of years -- from ensuring the planet moves into those danger zones. \"A price signal is essential and it definitely will do the things the white paper says in terms of unleashing investment in cleaner energy and reducing dependence on foreign oil,\" said Vicki Arroyo, executive director of the Georgetown Climate Center. \"That all is really critical.\" Some climate policy experts would rather see the dividends from the tax be spent on infrastructure projects that go further toward reducing emissions. And the idea of repealing some climate regulations -- like energy efficiency standards, which help families save money -- makes little sense to Arroyo. 4. Unclear if Congress, White House will go for it Of course, none of these details matter if neither the White House nor Congress takes up the idea. The GOP old-timers pushing the carbon tax aren't in the administration -- or in Congress. Halstead told me the group met with White House officials and were received warmly. But it's hard to imagine a climate change denier like Trump championing climate legislation. \"My crystal ball broke back in November and it keeps breaking every week now in terms of what might happen next,\" Arroyo told me. \"But I would be quite surprised\" if the Trump administration ran with this policy proposal, she said. Still, this is a critical moment in climate change policy. Trump is threatening to send the US back into the fossil fuel era -- and that's happening at exactly the moment China and others are making massive investments in renewable energy. World leaders are trying to figure out how to meet the targets they set as part of the Paris Agreement on climate change -- and whether that agreement will continue to exist in the modern political climate. \"This kind of conservation is really essential at this particular moment,\" Arroyo said. \"This is the major challenge of our time -- and at least they're putting forth a proposal.\" Sections", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T15:37:55.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
