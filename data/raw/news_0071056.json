Pls give me & my sis the honor 2 meet with u to talk transgender rghts.” \nA singer who rose to fame on America’s Got Talent , Evancho performed the national anthem at Trump’s inauguration last month. She faced particular scrutiny because the Trump administration’s anti-LGBT rhetoric seemed to be at odds with the fact her sister, 18-year-old Juliet Evancho, is transgender. \nJuliet has steadfastly defended her sister but did not attend the inauguration. \nEvancho’s tweets came after reports emerged that the Trump administration planned to reverse Obama-era federal guidance requiring public schools to let students use the bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities. The Trump administration followed through with the reversal shortly after Evancho’s tweeted. I am obviously disappointed in the @POTUS decision to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide. #sisterlove \n— jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) February 22, 2017 . @realDonaldTrump u gave me the honor 2 sing at your inauguration.
