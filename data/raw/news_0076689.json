He’s gotta go out there and show the Monster Bag, he’s going to show the TaylorMade driver. He’s going to get on TV, he’s got the Nike clothes, he’s gotta keep that stuff relevant. But the bottom line is he knows he can’t beat anybody. He knows it.\" \nPerez went on to say he thinks there is a chance Woods' career is finished. \n\"If he doesn’t play Augusta (The Masters), then it’s over. I can tell you that right now,\" Perez said. \"Personally, I don’t think you’ll see him again this year. I think he’s out. I don’t think you’ll see him again.\" \nWoods got wind of Perez's comments, and according to Golf Digest Tiger was less than pleased. Perez backtracked on his comments a bit after texting with Woods. \n“I’m not Tiger bashing, I’m not saying he’s not the greatest,” Perez said to Golf Digest. “That was me and my co-host [Michael Collins] talking about the current what-ifs of Tiger’s situation. I have done nothing but praise him my entire career.” \nWoods has battled injuries for much of the last two seasons and recently withdrew from Genesis Open and Honda Classic because of issues with his back.
