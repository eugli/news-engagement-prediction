When WNBA star Elena Delle Donne's fiancée, Amanda Clifton, popped the question last June, their blue Great Dane, Wrigley, delivered the message. \" Amanda somehow managed to clip the ring onto Wrigley's collar,\" the former Chicago Sky forward, 27, tells Us Weekly. \"She called Wrigley over to us and proposed!\" \nRealizing \"every girl wants to be proposed to,\" the Olympic gold medalist later arranged her own pooch-y moment for her fiancée. After a rooftop meal at their Chicago condo, she trotted out black lab–border collie mix Rasta, \"I dressed her dog in a wedding dress and wrote on a sign bordered in lights, 'Marry Me?'\" PHOTOS: Celebrity Couples and How They First Met: Love Story Beginnings \nDelle Donne made non–sports headlines when she first revealed her romance with Clifton, 27 — director of the De11e Donne Academy — in an August 2016 Vogue profile. \"I've decided I'm not at all going to hide anything,\" she said at the time. The Knot/Hudson Nichols Photography \nNow the pair, who met through friends four years ago, will be the first same-sex recipients of The Knot Dream Wedding. \"We were honored they asked us,\" says Delle Donne.
