By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 27, 2017 4:00 PM The Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections have seen the use of a number of Zumalas in campaigns. (ANI image) \nDrawing another analogy, PM Narendra Modi ’s on Monday said that BJP , if voted to power, will confront all Baahubalis of state, just the way Katappa killed Baahubali in a movie of same name. “A movie called Baahubali was released, Baahubali was killed Katappa in the end, after March 11 police’s baton will take care of them like Kattappa did,” Modi was addressing a rally in Uttar Pradesh’s Mau district. PM Modi further said that Congress , SP and BSP, should be punished for neglecting the state of years. “Punish Congress, SP and BSP for neglecting UP for years,” says PM Modi. “Do whatever possible to defeat BJP, PM Modi dares SP-Cong and BSP; but don’t ruin the future of UP,” Modi said. “We are undertaking measures for welfare of our farmer brothers and sisters. We want their incomes to double by 2022,” Modi said. “Why SP government doesn’t care about the farmers in Uttar Pradesh? Why they are not helping farmers in distress? They must answer,” says PM Modi. \nWatch | UP Polls: ‘BJP Sole Hope For State’s Prosperity, Says PM Modi \nThe Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections have seen the use of a number of Zumalas in campaigns. On Sunday, Samajwadi Party Kannauj MP Dimple Yadav re-termed the acronym ‘KASAB’-coined by BJP chief Amit Shah . “BJP says ‘Ka’ stands for Congress. Your Akhilesh bhaiyya says ‘Ka’ (in Hindi) stands for Computer, ‘Sa’ stands for smartphone, through which you can get all the information about the policies of the government and ‘B’ stands for ‘bachche’ (children),” Dimple, wife of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav , said at an election rally. The ruling Akhilesh Yadav-led Uttar Pradesh Government has a scheme to distribute laptops to meritorious students and promised to give smartphones if it returns to power in the state. Earlier, Shah at a rally last week at Chauri Chaura in Gorakhpur had used the ‘KASAB’ acronym to describe ‘Ka’ for Congress, ‘Sa’ for SP and ‘B’ for BSP. \nWhile PM Narendra Modi had termed BSP as Behenji Sampatti Party, and had earlier coined the acronym SCAM: Samajwadi, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati. Hitting back at Modi, Akhilesh had set acronym as Save Country From Amit Shah and Modi.
