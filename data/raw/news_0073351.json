Nigel Farage joins Donald Trump for dinner at Trump International Hotel \nOwner of the business, Alan Brook, told the MEN that when he found the scene the DVD the horny burglar had been watching was still playing on the shop’s computer. \nHe said: ‘It’s probably an embarrassed customer who didn’t have the guts to buy it. There’s a lot of valuable stuff here he could have taken, like a computer and DVD player and a £10,000 photocopier. \n‘There must be £25,000 of kit in there but that doll was the only thing that was taken. It makes me wonder whether somebody has broken in just to steal that doll. That’s certainly the impression the police gave me. \n‘It’s obvious they’ve also been watching porn on the office computer, the cheeky bugger. But apart from the damage, nothing else has been stolen.’ \nPolice were called to the shop yesterday morning while Mr Brook is faced with the task of repairing his roof. \nMr Brook added: ‘I don’t see a need to break in. We are cheap enough. Don’t be shy. Give us a try!’. More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:47:42.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
