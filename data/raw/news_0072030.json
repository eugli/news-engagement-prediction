CNN reported Conway was deliberately pulled off TV by the White House, a claim she denied.\n“I don’t think I have to explain myself if I’m not going on TV, if I’m out with four kids for three days looking at houses and schools. A lot of my colleagues aren’t trying to figure out how to be a mother of four kids, I assure you,” she said Wednesday night on the Fox News show Hannity .\n  Keith Ellison: Trump Has Done Enough To Warrant Impeachment Kellyanne Conway Predicts President Donald Trump Will Remain In Office For Eight Years Trump Rescinds Obama Administration’s Transgender Bathroom Initiative She noted that the White House has one very powerful messenger to get out its message — President Donald Trump.\n. @KellyannePolls : “[ @realDonaldTrump ] is his own best messenger.” #Hannity pic.twitter.com/gYNUqw1bhW \n— Fox News (@FoxNews) February 23, 2017 \n\n“About 5 percent of what I’m being asked to do in this White House counselor role is TV. And I think that’s about right because, he’s the president now and he is his own best messenger,” she said. “In just last week, he held a press conference for 77 minutes, took 17 questions. You got that information for free, all at the same time. Then two days later he was at a rally in Florida. So he’s his own best messenger.”\nAdvertisement – story continues below\nConway told host Sean Hannity that reports she was temporally benched were created by people “trying to start up trouble.”\n“There are some people, I think, trying to get in my way. I’ve … gobbled up a lot of other people’s TV opportunities so there’s some resentment on the outside, I believe, and folks just trying to use me as click bait in a headline,” she said.\n“But I am only there to serve the president, who is there to serve the American people. And I know very clearly what the portfolio includes, what I am supposed to do with his senior team, and I’m very comfortable with that,” she continued.\n  ICE:   ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis Takes Only Three Hours Of Rest Before Returning To Work As McCain Steps Up Criticism Of Trump, He Makes Surprise Trip To Syria Conway said the media-manufactured fuss over who says what and when they say it is not important\n“It’s not even worth arguing because it doesn’t bother us, some things are really small — and the presidency and vice presidency with Mike Pence are really, really big. They are going to do things that impact people’s lives,” she said.\nOn that point, she said, the Trump administration faces an uphill struggle against the media.\n“I think there’s something called presumptive negativity. It’s what is he saying, what are his advisors saying, what are they doing today, there must be something wrong or there must be something negative,” she said. “And I’d just ask people give us a wide berth. Actually focus on what he’s doing. He’s keeping all his campaign promises at a quick clip.”\nWhat do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:30:24.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
