His won nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch will not be confirmed in time in order to help rule in on the ban. Furthermore, the ban only had a 90 day lifespan, and would likely end before the Supreme Court could even take up the case at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:18:05.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
