Mesut Ozil suffering CRISIS of confidence, admits Arsenal boss Wenger \nAt the ceremony ahead of the first singles clash between Andrea Petkovic and Alison Riske, the soloist sang the words to ‘Deutschland Uber Alles’ as opposed to ‘Deutschlandlied’. \nWhile the tune is the same, the original version has been defunct since the fall of Nazi Germany and only the third stanza of the song is used in today’s national anthem. \nThe unfortunate soloist, however, belted out the words ‘Germany, Germany above all else’ rather than ‘Unity and justice and freedom for the German fatherland’. \nThe first verse of the original anthem (as seen in the video above) has effectively been banned in Germany and it no doubt caused plenty of offence to those who had made the trip to Hawaii. \nThe USTA was quick to apologise on Twitter for the error, writing: ‘The USTA extends a sincere apology to the German Fed Cup team & fans 4 the outdated National Anthem. The USTA extends a sincere apology to the German Fed Cup team & fans 4 the outdated National Anthem. This mistake will not occur again. pic.twitter.com/4LyG3ACe5u \n— USTA (@usta) February 11, 2017 \n‘This mistake will not occur again.’ \nGermany’s own tennis federation, Deutscher Tennis Bund, quickly responded: ‘We hope so’, before the USTA assured them that the mistake would not happen again. @DTB_Tennis We can assure you that it won't. Again, our sincere apologies. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:40:30.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
