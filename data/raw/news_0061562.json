At my direction, the Department's Office for Civil Rights remains committed to investigating all claims of discrimination, bullying and harassment against those who are most vulnerable in our schools.\"\nObama's guidelines, issued last May, ordered schools nationwide to permit transgender students to choose the bathroom they prefer without restriction.

The Obama administration then requested the block only apply to the 13 states that filed a lawsuit.\nEarlier this month, Trump's administration asked to withdraw a motion filed by Obama over the issue. In a court filing, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ' Justice Department requested to withdraw a government motion last year asking a judge to scale back the injunction.\nSupporters of Obama's order reacted Wednesday by pledging to continue the fight for LGBT rights.\n\"Washington, D.C., Is an inclusive city. We will continue to protect and support inclusive policies for our LGBTQIA students,\" Mayor Muriel Bowser said on Twitter .\nCivil rights groups have also said Trump's government can do only so much to impact transgender rights.\n\"Trump's action sends a terrible message to transgender students. But these students should know the law is on their side,\" the American Civil Liberties Union said Wednesday .\n\"President Trump's revocation of the guidance, however, does NOT undo legal protections for transgender students.\"\n  GOP lawmakers face contentious constituents at town halls Homeland Security issues new policies cracking down on illegal immigration Trump denounces bigotry, anti-Semitism during visit to African-American museum", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:14:42.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
