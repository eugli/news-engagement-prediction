Photo: Pat Scala \nColes' same store sales grew 1.3 per cent in the half. But lower prices meant revenue from the supermarket remained steady and earnings fell 6.8 per cent. \n\"The decline in earnings was driven by lower margins following increased investments in value, which were weighted towards the second quarter, including through the absorption of cost price increases in meat,\" Mr Goyder said. \nThe supermarket chain's sales during the half \"built on the strong growth achieved in the previous corresponding half\", he said. \nTarget continued to struggle in the six month period to December 31. The department store's sales fell 18 per cent and earnings before interest and tax fell 78 per cent - from $74 million in the first half last year to $16 million. \nMr Goyder said Target's $58 million earnings erosion reflected a \"difficult trading period and impacts associated with significant transition work underway\". \nThe problem child of the Wesfarmers' empire is being overhauled by the architect of Kmart's turnaround, Guy Rosso, who now heads up both department stores. \nKmart's sales grew 8.9 per cent and its earnings grew 16 per cent to $371 million, but that wasn't enough to stop Target's performance dragging the combined department store division's earnings backwards by 1.5 per cent to $387 million. \nSales at Bunnings grew 8.3 per cent and same store sales grew 6.5 per cent, driven by \"continued investment in customer value, stores and online', Mr Goyder said, sending earnings up almost 10 per cent to $770 million. \nBunnings' foray into the United Kingdom and Ireland, where it has bought the Homebase chain and will gradually turn them into Bunnings stores, ran at a $48 million loss. \nWesfarmers bought Homebase mid last year an opened its first Bunnings pilot store in St Albans, Hertfordshire, a fortnight ago. \nThe biggest increase in earnings came from Wesfarmer's industrial division. It recorded earnings of $377 million in the half - $355 million than the same half last year - thanks largely to \"the significant increases in coal prices and strong productions in the second quarter of the financial year,\" Mr Goyder said. \nMr Goyder will hand over the reins of the company to Wesfarmers' head of industrials, Rob Scott, in November.
