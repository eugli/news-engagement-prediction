He was identified as a Muslim convert from Manchester, born Ronald Fiddler.\nMr Blair came under fire for his government's lobbying for the Guantanamo Bay prisoner's release.\nThe Daily Mail Quote: d Tory MP Tim Loughton as saying: \"So much for Tony Blair's assurances that this extremist did not pose a security threat. He clearly was a risk to Britain and our security all along.\n\"It adds insult to injury that he was given £1 million in compensation because of Blair's flawed judgement that he was an innocent.\"\nTony Blair: Brexit is not inevitable However, Mr Blair said: \"When his release was announced in very measured terms in 2004, pointing out the risks which remained with Guantanamo detainees, the Conservative MPs reacted by strongly criticising not the release, but why it had taken so long.\n\"The fact is that this was always a very difficult situation where any Government would have to balance proper concern for civil liberties with desire to protect our security, and we were likely to be attacked whatever course we took.\"\nHe added: \"The reason it did take a long time for their release was precisely the anxiety over their true affiliations.\n\"But those who demanded their release should not be allowed to get away with now telling us that it is a scandal that it happened.\"\nGitmo: The Movie - Inside Guantánamo Bay 6 show all Gitmo: The Movie - Inside Guantánamo Bay 1/6 Base instincts: staff facilities at Guantanamo Bay US Naval Base, Cuba\nAFP / GETTY IMAGES\n2/6 Adrian Baschuk filming at the base\n3/6 A scene from the notorious camp\n4/6 'Next day, I was woken early by my two chaperons.

Not only are they wrong, they are ineffective.\"\nThe source said it was \"impossible to say\" whether Fiddler's involvement with Isis was motivated by his experiences in detention, but added: \"Democratic values and human rights were clearly violated on a substantial scale, not only in Guantanamo, but in other detention camps and torture camps used in the war on terror.\"\nThe source said the campaign for the release of British detainees was backed \"across the spectrum\" of UK politics.\nGraphiq At the time of his al-Harith's release, then Home Secretary David Blunkett said: \"No one who is returned... will actually be a threat to the security of the British people.\"\nThe Labour former cabinet minister told BBC Radio 4's The World At One : \"There was no process associated with Guantanamo Bay by which the guilt or innocence of the people incarcerated there could be assessed - one of the failings of the US administration there.\n\"So we were in a bind and you can't just keep people locked up forever on the basis of suspicion.\n\"We wanted them returned, where the evidence we had was that they posed no serious and immediate threat — there was never a guarantee that these people would not in the future become more active in terrorism.\"\nAround 850 individuals of national security concern have travelled to join the conflict, according to figures published by the Government last year.\nOf those, just under half have returned to the UK and approximately 15 per cent are dead.", "external_links": ["https://www.graphiq.com/vlp/ekLEAiOQpmJ", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/ekLEAiOQpmJ", "http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/smiling-suicide-bomber-was-british-convert-released-from-guantanamo-h2wlfj6hj", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4247702/MPs-blast-1m-compensation-Gitmo-Briton.html"], "published": "2017-02-22T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:28:01.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
