It has already received approvals to market the product in Columbia, Ecuador, Indonesia and the Philippines over the last month and is currently awaiting regulatory approvals from the European Union, he said. \nSome doctors find BVS a good choice for young patients between 25-45 years because it dissolves and could give them a relatively better quality of life than metallic drug eluting stents. \n\"If you believe in the science, a scaffold that dissolves would reduce the need for patients to be on several medications for a long time,\" Columbia Asia senior consultant Sanjat Chiwane told ET. \"It would be an ideal therapy for anybody because you don't have a device inside your body forever.\" \nAt the same time, he said no single study has proven BVS are more efficient than drug eluting stents. \"They're not superior to second or third generation stents, but they're not inferior either,\" Chiwane said. \nIndia's cardiac stent market is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14% and cross $1.8 billion in revenues by 2026, according to a recent report by Future Market Insights. \nThe size of this market was estimated at $531 million (roughly Rs 3,619 crore) in 2016 end. Yet, so far, BVS have contributed to a small portion of these revenues, said an analyst on condition of anonymity. \nBVS also has its own limitations from a procedure perspective. For instance, existing BVS are twice as thick as a metallic drug eluting stents and don't have as many size options, Chiwane said.
