Bladder stones smaller than 1cm may pass out in the urine. But bigger stones such as this one, which is 4cm by 4cm, need surgery. This picture was posted by Dr Oktay Ozman, a urologist at the Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty in Istanbul. He explains that the patient had come to him complaining of pain in his pelvis, slow urination and blood in his urine (caused by the spikes damaging the bladder wall). While some men with bladder stones won't have any symptoms, others will suffer pain in the bladder area, blood in the urine, cloudy urine or difficulty passing it Tests, including a cystoscopy, where a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end is inserted into the urethra (which carries urine out of the body), revealed he had an enlarged prostate. 'It's impossible to say for how long he'd had the stone,' says Dr Ozman. 'It was quite big, but I have seen some that are 7cm.' The patient had surgery to remove the stone and his prostate. 'He spent a week with the stone in his pocket showing it to everyone and then donated it to us,' says Dr Ozman. 'It's one of the most beautiful jackstones I've seen.' The good news? A year on, the patient is said to be doing well. Research shows the best way to prevent bladder stones is to drink plenty of fluid. Urinating in a sitting position may help empty the bladder more effectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:37:11.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
