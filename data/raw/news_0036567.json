As such, the status of women in these countries makes any claim to feminism easy for critics to dismiss as near-delusion. \nReligion is not separate from culture. It changes, modifies, and in some cases regresses as the culture does. And there is no doubt that mainstream Islam is regressing in a world where Saudi Arabian Wahhabism is fast becoming the accepted mainstream version of Islam. This isn't just about the specific culture in that part of the world, but about the dissemination of this particular culture's interpretation of the religion. \nMuslims can't afford to deny there is a problem here. Regressive applications of Islamic law are spreading across the Muslim world as more turn to these unforgiving interpretations, from Aceh in Indonesia to Brunei to parts of rebel-held Syria . \nTo think that this interpretation cannot spread here in one form or another is disingenuous; we see it happening, for example, when Islamic conferences issue promotional posters with female speakers replaced with shadowy figures . And while that particular insult to women was swiftly rectified when the Muslim community loudly demanded the poster be changed, it doesn't mean the underlying problem has been addressed. \nDoes this mean that Lambie is right? Of course not. There is no chance of criminal Sharia being introduced here. But there is a danger that the practice of Islam may become more fundamentalist as more people accept this interpretation, which consolidates the application of Islam in Muslim-majority countries. \nIt also means that arguments over faith versus culture are moot. As are those over whether Sharia conflicts with Australian law. Clearly, criminal Sharia does, whereas the personal moral code does not. \nBut as long as we argue over these semantics, we will not address the pressing question over which interpretation of Islam will win. That of liberal Muslims like Abdel-Magied, for whom Sharia is a personal matter? Or that of the one Lambie fears, where Muslims are subject to crude and draconian criminal law? \nMuslims need to assert their right to be and practice their religion, but we also must admit it is getting harder to hold on to this feminist vision of the religion that Yassmin clings to. \nThere is a battle for the soul of Islam. And it is vital that Muslims acknowledge the dangers – and equally vital that the likes of Lambie accept that in this battle liberal Muslims are not the enemy. They are the key to Islam's future and the hope that it can once regain the progressive nature that made it so appealing to early Muslim women who flocked to hear and accept the prophet's radical revelations.
