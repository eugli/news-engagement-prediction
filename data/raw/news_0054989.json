Twitter 1 of 5 The depraved terror group released a photo of what is is believed to be Ronald Fiddler, known as Abu Zakariya al-Britani , who detonated a car bomb at an Iraqi army base near the Iraqi city of Mosul. TWITTER/RUDAW ENGLISH Women were seen smoking and men later danced in celebration \nThe video comes in the same week Iraqi forces obliterated Islamic State terrorists in the outskirts of Mosul . \nThe Iraqi troops blasted the village of Abu Sayyaf, which overlooks Mosul, as they close in on regaining the city. \nGovernment forces have now begun their assault to reclaim the whole city after Iraq’s ministry of defence deployed air jets to drop leaflets across western Mosul to warn residents of the imminent battles. \nThe footage also comes after an ISIS jihadi boasted about raping more than 200 Iraqi women and called it “normal”. \nAmar Hussein said “young men need this. This is normal” during an interview after he had been captured by Kurdish forces during an assault on the city of Kirkuk in October that killed 99 civilians.
