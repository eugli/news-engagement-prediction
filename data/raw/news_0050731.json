We don’t take our husbands’ last names because we aren’t their property. We were given the right to own land ... The fact is, in sharia it says you follow the law of the land you are on.” \nMore than 15,000 people have signed a change.org petition calling for the ABC to sack Ms Abdel-Magied from her role a host on the ABC’s Saturday morning program Australia Wide, on News 24. News.com.au has contacted Ms Abdel-Magied for comment. Yassmin Abdel-Magied, host Tony Jones and Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie on the Q&A panel. Source: News Corp Australia \nThe petition was created by right-wing group, AltCon News, which accused Ms Abdel-Magied of advocating for Islamic faith courts in Australia. The group alleged Ms Abdel-Magied was “blatantly lying to the public about the merits of sharia law and the oppressive impact it has on non-Muslim groups, homosexuals and women”. \nThe ABC will not fire Ms Abdel-Magied in relation to the Q&A episode and subsequent fallout, an ABC spokesperson told news.com.au. Meanwhile, the number of signatures on the petition continues to climb. \n“As Yassmin Abdul-Magied made these comments on the tax payer funded QandA program, and as she is a regularly paid commentator on the tax payer funded network, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation needs to reassure the tax paying public that they condemn her rhetoric and that Australians obey one set of laws, that no religious law is higher than the law of the land and that her blatant lies about this law will.not be tolerated or funded by the Australian tax payers,” the petition reads. \n“The ALTCON team feel that it is very important to note that we are avid supporters of free speech and Yassmin Abdul-Magied’s right to say what she said, but NOT her right to spew this Pro-sharia Propaganda while she is a taxpayer funded ABC presenter.” \nThe petition was a retort to another petition launched by Muslim leaders who supported Ms Abdel-Magied, which has so far received just under 2,500 signatures. \nHizb ut-tahrir spokesman Wassim Doureihi described Ms Abdel-Magied’s comments as “indeed problematic”. \nIn response, Ms Abdel-Magied, a Sudanese born writer and founder of Youth Without Borders, sought advice from Mr Doureihi on Facebook three days after the program was broadcast. \n“Salams! Well, I am always happy to take feedback. What specifically was problematic and how can I do better in the future inshallah?,’ Ms Abdel-Magied asked. News Corp Australia columnist Rita Panahi.

Source: Supplied \nNews Corp columnist Rita Panahi said she was “scolded” on air by ABC host Rafael Epstein for not supporting Ms Abdel-Magied, who she described as“an Islamic activist advocating for sharia law”. \n“ABC radio drive host Rafael Epstein had the gall to admonish me, a migrant who escaped a country under Islamic law, for not supporting an advocate of Islamic law,” Ms Panahi wrote. \n“It’s akin to a freed slave being criticised for a fear of slavery and reluctance to support slavery advocates.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:12:05.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
