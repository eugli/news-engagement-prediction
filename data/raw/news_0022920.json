And while Apple fans will be thrilled that the company is (reportedly) finally introducing wireless charging and a slew of other upgrades, the fancy features could push the phone to a staggering $1,000 price tag.

Here's a partial list of other things you can spend your hard-earned cash on. Three KLIPPANs \nThe IKEA workhorse is one of the most budget-friendly sofas on the market; at $299, you could buy three for the reported price of the iPhone 8 (rumored to also be called iPhone X, as in the 10th anniversary of the iPhone). You can't sit nine friends on your phone, no matter how much OLED technology the screen has. On the other hand, you could buy 52 iPhone 8s for the price of Kendall Jenner's Campana Brothers sofa . \nYou could also drop a G on two of these other sofas under $500 , or on one sweet velvet option . One each of Rifle Paper Co.'s Terai Chairs for Anthropologie \nSmitten with Rifle Paper Co.'s playful patterns?

Check out all that the beautiful US of A has to offer, and you can snap photos along the way with the 7 Plus's double lens camera ( which the 8 will also reportedly have ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:24:30.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
