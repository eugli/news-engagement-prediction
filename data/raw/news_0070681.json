But unlike other mothers, however, she won’t get to see her daughter grow up. \nEva, the name Keri kept for her unborn daughter, which means ‘life’, has a condition called anencephaly. \nThe condition is an untreatable one where the brain of the embryo does not develop appropriately. It’s so rare that it only occurs in six births per every 1,000 births in the UK. Sadly, babies born with this condition tend to only tend to survive for a few days. \nglobalnews.ca \nDespite being told this 30 seconds after being diagnosed with Eva, Keri asked the doctors if it she could possibly continue with the pregnancy so that her organs could help save the life other babies who are in desperate need of organs. \nOn a Facebook post, Keri wrote: “This is our daughter’s perfect heart. She has perfect feet and hands. She has perfect kidneys, perfect lungs, and a perfect liver. Sadly, she doesn’t have a perfect brain.” \n\"We found out recently she has anencephaly and is terminal. Faced with terrible options we have decided to continue the pregnancy to full term s o Eva, which literally means life, can grow strong and give life to multiple people through organ donation.” \nmirror.co.uk \n\"This was not an easy decision. For the next 20 weeks, I will feel her kick, have the hiccups and we'll be able to hear her perfect heart beating all while knowing we'll only get a few short hours with her when she's born. As you might expect, we're devastated but have an amazing support system with our family, friends, church and doctors. We're choosing to try and see the positives in this situation and cherish our time with Eva, and be grateful for the impact she will have on the world in the short amount of time she'll spend in it.\" \nHer husband, Royce Young, praised his wife and their son, Harrison, in a post he shared last Friday, which received thousands of comments from people who were touched by their story.
