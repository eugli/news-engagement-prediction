It will lead to the Marathi manoos being thrown out and will kick-start the process of separation of Mumbai from Maharashtra,\" Raj told TOI. The BJP has made the issue of development the main plank of its poll cam paign. \"There are various modes of public transport like local trains or BEST buses. Why do we need the Metro? Locals are suffering because of outsiders and if the time comes, they will favour separation of Mumbai from Ma harashtra,\" he added. The MNS has been on the downswing since the past couple of years. Only one MLA of the party was elected to the state as sembly in 2014 and political observers said the Marathi manoos, the party's main votary , seemed to have deserted the outfit. While asked about his definition of Marathi manoos, Raj said, \"Whoever has accepted Maharashtra's culture is a Marathi manoos irrespective of his surname. The Shiv Sena was earlier critical of south Indians. But after the development of Tamil Nadu, people from there stopped migrating to Mumbai. I would suggest to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that if he concentrates on the development of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, the whole country would be relieved.\" The MNS has 28 corporators in the outgoing House, but some of Raj's loyal aides have switched sides. \"Because I did not allow them to be corrupt. They left the party,\" Raj said.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:52:52.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
