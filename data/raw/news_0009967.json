Well, other than OSU landing an incredible class. Slot to Ohio State Links \nWe are not certain how many of Urban Meyer 's players over the years have dared to play a joke on him. However, it must be a very short list, especially when it comes to pranking Meyer in a big way. \nEnter Baron Browning , the Buckeyes' five-star recruit who is ranked as the No. 1 outside linebacker and the No. 11 overall prospect in the country in the 2017 class, per the 247Sports Composite. \nBrowning has already enrolled at Ohio State, but prior to making his announcement, he decided to have a little fun with Meyer. \nBucknuts asked Browning about that on Wednesday during his first interview since enrolling. \n“I was committing on that Thursday, and I told Alabama and I told Coach Meyer and them to come down on Wednesday, because those were the only in-homes I was going to do before I made my decision,\" Browning said. \"They both came in and we talked, and I was kind of undecided that night. And then the next day, I made up my mind, and my parents were like: ‘Will you at least tell us before you tweet it out and stuff?’ Coach Meyer was texting me and the coach from Alabama, he was still trying to do some recruiting. \n“So, I already knew I was going to come here, but I just felt like messing around. That’s the type of guy I am; I love cracking jokes. So, I texted Coach Meyer and Coach (Luke) Fickell and I was like: ‘Thank you for everything you’ve done for me, but I’m rolling with the Tide.’ And it was just funny all around.” \nWell, not all around. Meyer did not find it amusing. \nBut the coach got his revenge in a rather short period of time. 5-star comedian, too? (Photo: 247Sports) \n“Yeah, he got me back already,” Browning said. “It was when I was in school back home. I was in class and he texted me and was like: ‘Call me when you’re with your mom.’ My mom is an assistant principal at my school. I knew it was obviously something serious, so I went to the office with my mom and we called him. She put his phone on speaker and I’m listening and he’s like: ‘What’s up Baron.’ And I think this is right when the Rams had fired Jeff Fisher . And he was just like: ‘Hey, what’s up man. I’m just calling to let you know the LA Rams had offered me the (head coaching) job and I’m going to take it.’ And I’m just sitting there looking at (the phone) and my mouth just dropped. Like, I don’t even know what to say; I’m just speechless. And I’m just sitting there and he’s like: ‘Hello?’ And I’m not even saying nothing because I’m mad. I’m just listening. And he’s like: ‘You there?’ And I’m like: ‘Yeah, I’m here.’ And then a few minutes passed and he was like: ‘Ah, I’m just messing with you.’ But I wasn’t laughing though. \n“So, he got me back. I see how he felt. And I was really mad because my mom was in on it too. They planned it together. And I was just like: ‘Wow.’ But I guess I had that coming. And he was like: ‘That’s my payback, so don’t ever do that to me again.’” \nWe have a feeling that Browning won’t be joking to Meyer about transferring to another program anytime soon. \nAbout 2.5 hours after the media spoke to Browning, Meyer gave his recollection of trading practical jokes with one of his prized recruits. \n“I remember sitting down, and I looked down and he was going to commit,” Meyer said. “I was over at a friend's (house). I can't remember what time of year it was. And I remember looking, I leaned over, I said here it comes. Boom. I look down, and I can't remember if he called or sent me a text, and he said: ‘I'm going to roll with Bama,’ or something. I took my phone and threw it against the wall. I sit down, and all of a sudden I hear it buzzing again over there. I look and it's his father, and his father says: ‘Hey, we got him, coach, congrats.’ I said: ‘What the hell are you talking about? He's going to Alabama.’ He said: ‘No, he's just playing around.’ So he got me good.” \nAnd Meyer doesn’t like to be gotten good. Hence pretending he was off to the NFL. Meyer was surprised to learn Browning told the media that portion of the story. \n“Oh, he cried,” Meyer said. “Did he tell you that? Did he tell you he teared up?” \nMeyer was informed Browning only said that he was mad. \n“He told you this?” Meyer asked. “You guys are going to like covering him the next few years (laughter). \n“So there was all those rumors about the Los Angeles Rams, so I called his mom because she's great, and I said: ‘Keisha, let's go get him.’ She said: 'OK, what do you want to do?’ I said: ‘I'm going to call’ -- because she teaches at the school -- ‘call him down there and let's put him speakerphone. I want to see his reaction.’ So we did it. \n“I said: ‘Baron, I've got some tough news for you, but I've taken this job.’ And you just hear quiet. And I go: ‘Hey, man, you all right?’ Just quiet, quiet. I said: ‘I'm just kidding, man. You all right?’ His mom said: ‘Man, he was crying, he was crying.’ Great stories.” \nThat they certainly are. \nWhat's next for the Buckeyes?
