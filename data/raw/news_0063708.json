Bryan Carlisle of the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office said the boy called around 5:40 a.m. to report the violent act at his family's home in Conroe, about 40 miles north of Houston. \n\"He was begging his father to stop stabbing his mother,\" Carlisle said. \nThe boy stayed on the phone until sheriff's deputies arrived eight minutes later. He was drenched in blood when he came out of the house, Carlisle said. \nTwo deputies went into the home and were confronted by the father â later identified as 41-year-old Medger Blake â who was holding a knife. When Blake refused to drop the knife and lunged toward them, they shot him dead. Deputies: Deceased suspect is Medger Blake, say he killed wife Rose Blake. They shot/killed him. Son, 11, called 911. #khou11 pic.twitter.com/af5kxlfxd5 — Lauren Talarico (@KHOULauren) February 22, 2017 \nThe boy's mother, 38-year-old Rose Blake, was found dead in a bedroom, Carlisle said. The boy was uninjured, and relatives were headed to Conroe to be with him. \n\"Our hearts go out to the young boy,\" said Carlisle, who added that the boy is a hero. \nLt. Scott Spencer of the sheriff's office said a note was found in the home, but he did not know who had written it. Authorities said there had been no previous reports of violence at the home.
