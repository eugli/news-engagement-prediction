Ranieri was sacked (Picture: Getty) \n‘And if we cannot win anything or even come close to big things over the next few years then it will be difficult to go for it. \n‘Until now I didn’t understand it as I’ve always been on a long contract, as long as I wanted, and I have no idea why exactly it happened to me. \n‘Liverpool as a club wants to have a strong relationship with its manager but as always it depends on success.
