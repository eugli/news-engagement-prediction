Then, in high school he earned Eagle Scout status and says he never stopped relying on the values he learned early. \n“If you set a goal, you can achieve it… to be able to have that confidence was one of the things I experienced,” says Lee. \nAfter college, the Boy Scouts would become Lee’s career. Even after retiring, he still volunteers. “I’ve heard people say the things they learned in scouting were the same people skills they use as an adult, so that was my experience as well.” (Photo Credit: Leo Lee) \n“[I] still feel like it’s still a benefit to young people.” And when asked about how his continued commitment to scouting and its values helps him? “The satisfaction of seeing young people grow up into people of character.” \nAnd he didn’t have to look far to find them. \n“Our two sons are eagles, our daughter married an eagle, she has a son that’s an eagle… our other son has a son that’s an eagle,” says Lee—adding that scouting is definitely a “family thing.” Oh, yes, the girls were active in scouting as well. “If you set a goal, you can achieve it… to be able to have that confidence was one of the things I experienced,” (Photo Credit: Leo Lee) \n“The songs, the smell of the campfire… the s’mores,” says Lee, all bring back wonderful memories. He and his wife, Jerry, have finally slowed down a bit. They recently joined the Presbyterian Village North retirement community and say they take advantage of opportunities to exercise regularly. After all, that promise included physical fitness! \nOver the years, the Boy Scouts organization has endured its critics. It has bent under the winds of change. And yet, Lee insists that teaching young people to live with integrity and character, should not be controversial. \n“The country would be better off.” \n  Robbie Owens facebook Follow Robbie grew up in northeast Texas, in a tiny town where her family's history spans six generations.
