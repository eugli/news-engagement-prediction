While the citizens breathe air of terror following the suicide blast, it has also taken a toll on cultural happenings. Romanian singer Edward Maya’s performance at Port Grand last Saturday was postponed in the light of the tragedy incident in Sehwan. \nMusicians to hold peace jam at Lal Shahbaz Qalandar’s shrine \n“We have delayed it to the first or second week of March now,” co-organiser Atif Zubair told The Express Tribune. He cited the Sehwan attack as the primary reason for the delay. “Secondly, the security agencies warned us. They said the next 72 hours were crucial and we must not take any risk.” \nZubair said Maya left for Romania soon after and they will announce new dates soon. “Now the concert that is rescheduled for March will be a tribute to Pakistani people because whatever happens, we continue to be a resilient nation.” \nHave something to add to the story?
