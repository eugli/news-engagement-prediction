(ABC News: Laura Gartry) \nParent's from the western suburbs are also unhappy with the decision to scrap the new City Beach College. \nThe Liberal National Government pledged $84 million to upgrade the site of the former City Beach High School to ease growing enrolment pressure in Perth's western suburbs. \nThe original City Beach High School was closed in 2005, and the remaining schools servicing the western suburbs are bursting at the seams. \nChurchlands Senior High School's student body grew from 1,443 in 2011 to 2,500 last year. Shenton College has grown to more than 1,900 students. \n'We need a Highschool' group spokesman James Fuller, who has two children at City Beach school, said he had not seen any data that supported the idea the CBD school would reduce pressure on the area. \n\"The feeling is, it is a play for some of the marginal seats like Perth and Mount Lawley rather than a solid education policy,\" he said. \nMs Ellery said a Labor government would make a decision on the future of the City Beach site if elected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:09:43.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
