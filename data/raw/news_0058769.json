Storm Doris swell \n“The increase in people’s awareness as to when severe weather is on the way and what they need to do about it when it comes has been really huge,” Ms Chives told the Today programme. \n“In fact, the storm that had the biggest engagement on our social media channels was storm Barbara, which you might remember was right before Christmas last year. \n“We saw 81,000 tweets and 4,000 retweets about storm Barbara, so people knew it was on the way. \n“Previously, if you had a lot of storms coming in one after another, people got confused and just thought ‘oh well, it’s just another windy day’.” UK storm names 2017/18 \nS torms Barbara and Angus are among the most severe to have been named by the public since the scheme began. \nThe former, which hit the UK on 20 November with gusts of up to 84mph, resulted in a woman dying after being winched from the sea at Folkestone, and 150 passengers on board a ferry at Cardigan Bay being stranded for more than 24 hours. \nMs Chives’ comments come as meteorologists warned that the UK faces two weeks of severe weather, as Storm Doris gives rise to a ‘Black Thursday’ of snowdrifts and wind gales. \nThe storm has already resulted in a schoolboy being hospitalised, after a falling tree hit him whilst he was walking home from school with a group of friends in Arnos Vale, Bristol. Storm Doris hits UK: in pictures \nA cross the country, gale force winds have caused power cuts and delayed flights, whilst parts of the Welsh coastline have been hit by isolated flooding. \nIn order to deal with the disruption, the Ministry of Defence announced today that the Army had been placed on standby, as the Met warned that parts of England and Scotland could see snowdrifts reaching 4 ft in just a few hours, in a phenomenon known as a ‘snow bomb’.
