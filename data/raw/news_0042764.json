As of today, stats compiled by the Press Association find that he’s overtaken Pierce Brosnan, having been in the job for over 11 years – 4,147 days to be exact, since he was announced as the new Bond in October, 2005. His tenure comprises four movies – ‘Casino Royale’, ‘Quantum of Solace’, ‘Skyfall’ and ‘Spectre’. Brosnan also made four movies, ‘GoldenEye’, ‘Tomorrow Never Dies’, ‘The World Is Not Enough’ and ‘Die Another Day’, over 4,146 days in the tux. But both trail behind Roger Moore, who remains the longest-serving Bond, with seven movies in the 5,118 days he spent as 007.

Meanwhile, Timothy Dalton and George Lazenby bring up the rear, having served 2,863 days and 875 days respectively. Whether Daniel Craig will make it to five movies remains unknown. He expressed doubt over continuing in the role in an interview immediately after wrapping ‘Spectre’, famously saying he’d rather ‘slit his wrists’ than make another Bond film. But that was talking in the aftermath of a lengthy and complicated international shoot, so he may well have mellowed some since then, and if he stays for another movie, it would be the historic 25th in the series too. All manner of other actors from Aidan Turner to Idris Elba to Tom Hardy have been rumoured as possible replacements for Craig. The next Bond movie is said to be landing in early 2018, though if production isn’t already in progress, that could be somewhat ambitious.
