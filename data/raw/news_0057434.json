We confirmed it. \nThen they claimed a postmortem on him that we rejected because he is a diplomatic passport holder and our citizen who is under the consular protection of the DPRK. \nBut, the Malaysian side forced the postmortem without our permission and witnessing, we will categorically reject the result of the postmortem conducted unilaterally excluding our attendance. \nThis is the culmination of the violation of the human rights of and infringing upon our citizen disregarding the elementary international laws and the consular laws. Advertisement \nAfter concluding the postmortem the Malaysian police side said that they would release the body which they didn't need any more if we submit a document through Wisma Putra (MFA) and Wisma Putra too requested us to do it and we did it. \nBut Malaysian side did not answer after one day passed since then. \nToday I met with the high officer of the Malaysian Police and strongly demanded him to release the body without further delay but he rejected our demand raising the issue which has nothing to do with clarification of the cause of death. \nThis strongly suggests that the Malaysian side is trying to conceal something which needs more time and deceive us and that they are colluding with the hostile forces towards us who are desperate to harm us of malice. \nWe doubt whether the Malaysian side was asked to do like this by someone else. \nThe South Korean puppet authorities are desperate to escape from their miserable state of the largest ever political scandal. \nThey are distorting the public opinion resorting to the tricky plots to defame the image of the DPRK with this incident. \nThe public opinion of the South Korean people, too, are suspicious that the conservative forces might mop up this incident to save the Park Geun Hye regime and to find out an excuse to force the \"THAAD\" deployment which has been strongly opposed within and without. \nThat's why we strongly urge and demand the Malaysian side not to be entangled in a political plot of the hostile forces and to release the body and the result of the postmortem to us without further delay. \nWe don't see this incident simple, further we will not tolerate at all the attitude of the Malaysian side in collusion with the hostile forces towards our Republic. \nWe will respond strongly to the moves of the hostile forces towards us with their intent to besmirch the image of our Republic by politicising this incident and sue file this to the International Court.
