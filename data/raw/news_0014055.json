Instead, he compared it to a satanic ritual. \n“The organizers of the Super Bowl are deciding to defile America and break our will by having us bow down to this,” Jones said in a rant posted Sunday on his website. \nJones took aim at Lady Gaga’s set, which will feature hundreds of drones. He saw this as an unmistakable arm of the surveillance state. Also Read: Did Lady Gaga Just Tease Beyonce Cameo at Super Bowl Halftime Show?

They have to tell you what they’re planning in the future.” \n“The rise of the machines is here,” Jones continued. “You are broken, you are fallen, and I squat on top of you and basically piss all over you. Just like at the Hillary event, she wore the clear Nazi pure black uniform with the SS hat and the red insignia to again, flaunt it, rub it in, dominate you and say, ‘I am the dark one, I am the beast.'” \nJones went on to describe Lady Gaga as “this groveling, pathetic, power-tripping person that’s all about ego,” and concluded his rant by calling the pop singer a “poison” that the powers that be are forcing down the throats of people to make them fall. \nWatch the video above. 13 Offbeat Super Bowl Prop Bets, From Lady Gaga's Hair to Donald Trump (Photos) \nAmericans bet billions of dollars annually on the Super Bowl, but not all of it is directly on the game itself -- or even anything to do with football.
