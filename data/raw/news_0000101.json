An Asian was charged by the Public Prosecution of Al Ain city for killing his 34-year-old nephew, while wounding the other nephew, 35, while they were sleeping at a farm house in Al Ain. The incident was reportedly premeditated as the accused went to one of the farm where his brother worked, early morning armed with a cleaver. He then barged into the room of his nephews (brother's sons) who were sleeping and attacked them. He first stabbed the younger one to death and then attacked the other nephew who sustained serious injuries and is in a critical state. On hearing their screams, their father rushed to their room and saw his brother, 55, commit the gory act. The accused, however, managed to fled the scene. The father then asked his neighbour to call the police and the ambulance. The police also recovered the weapon used for the murder.
