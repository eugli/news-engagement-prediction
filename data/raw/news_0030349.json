And it is home to the pictured galaxy known as NGC 7640. \nThough many different classifications have been used to identify galaxies by shape and structure, but NGC 7640 is a barred spiral type. These are recognizable by their spiral arms, which fan out not from a circular core, but from an elongated bar cutting through the galaxy’s center. \nOur home galaxy, the Milky Way, is also a barred spiral galaxy. Galaxy NGC 7640 might not look much like a spiral in the image because of the orientation of the galaxy with respect to Earth — or to Hubble, which acted as photographer in this case! \nWe often do not see galaxies face on, which can make features such as spiral arms less obvious. \nAs per reports, there is evidence that NGC 7640 has experienced some kind of interaction in its past. Galaxies contain vast amounts of mass, and therefore affect one another via gravity. Sometimes these interactions can be mild, and sometimes hugely dramatic, with two or more colliding and merging into a new, bigger galaxy. Understanding the history of a galaxy, and what interactions it has experienced, helps astronomers to improve their understanding of how galaxies — and the stars within them — form.
