The trailer of the film struck a chord with the general public and the film is highly anticipated. The music album of the film consists of just four songs which is lesser in number since most films nowadays have at least six songs. But it goes with the genre of the film as it’s a court room drama, songs are not really required in the film. The film has multiple composers including Meet Bros, Vishal Khurana, Manj Musik and Chirrantan Bhatt. And the lyrics are by Manj Musik, Raftaar, Junaid Wasi and Shabbir Ahmed. Let’s check out which song works and which doesn’t: \nGo Pagal \nThe hook line of the song will surely be played in clubs and pubs irrespective of the festival. Raftaar is effective while Nindy Kaur’s vocals are negligible. Apart from the hook line or tune, the song is not really going anywhere as one would have expected it to be. Also the best part of the song, its hook line, has an uncanny similarity to Let’s Nacho from Kapoor & Sons, which is fine as it works in the favour of the song. \nBawara Mann \nSung by Jubin Nautiyal and Neeti Mohan, this romantic ballad is the best track of the album. Jubin Nautiyal was brilliant in the recently released Kaabil and he repeats his brilliance once again. Neeti Mohan compliments him perfectly. In fact the two sound good together. The ‘alaap’ by Rheek Chakraborty adds weight to the song. Music by Chirratan Bhatt is very easy to the ears and lyricist Junaid Wasi has done a brilliant job with the lyrics. The song has ‘Teri Meherbani’ from The Shaukeens, feel to it but a better version. My only complaint from the song is its duration, the song could’ve been little longer. \nCheck out the full jukebox below: \nJolly Good Fellow \nThis song celebrates the spirit of Jolly. An Indianised version of ‘For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow’, this one’s a situational track. The music is by Meet Bros and they have crooned it has well. The problem with Meet Bros songs are they mostly sound the same. The lyrics by Shabbir Ahmed are a little off track. This number can be avoided easily. Also read: Akshay Kumar’s Jolly LLB 2 gets U/A certificate and no cuts \nO Re Rangreza (Qawaali) \nThis Qawaali sung by Sukhwinder Singh, Murtuza Mustafa & Qadir Mustafa is a treat to the ears. This was the Sukhwinder Singh we have been missing for a quite some time now. Music by Vishal Khurana and lyrics by Junaid Wasi strike a chord instantly. I hope the Qawaali gets the visibility and its due like Bhar Do Jholi from Bajrangi Bhaijaan . Highly recommended. \nOverall, the album of Jolly LLB 2 is a mixed bag with two brilliant songs. \nOur Pick \nBawra Mann, O Re Rangreza (Qawaali).
