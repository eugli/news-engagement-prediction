This information isn’t crucial for enjoying Future ’s song of the same name, from his recently released self-titled album —“Draco” is only tangentially about the gun and firing it. But it helps explain who and what, exactly, we’re dealing with here: a man way beyond subtlety, a celebrity gunman navigating the rap and trap worlds, where the one with the biggest stick usually wins. ” On “Draco,” Future is shooting a starter pistol in the air mid-victory lap. \n“Draco” commences with a bang: over the 808s rippling and beneath scuttling hi-hats, he repeats the dizzying phrase, “You ain’t never ever get your bitch back.” Like many Future songs, “Draco” is about control, and he has it here completely. His flow careens from one direction to the next with ease, riding waves of starry synths. His melodies flutter off, then circle back and hammer in fixed notes. His maneuvering is only matched in scale by his braggadocio (he buys a Fendi couch for his kids). “You know I got a pimp degree,” he cautions. He even makes time to send a single, well-placed shot at his imitator (“Stop comparing my career/Designer flooded through my crib”). Opponents known and unknown are all put on notice: Future isn’t running out of ammunition any time soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:01:13.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
