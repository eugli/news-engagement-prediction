READ MORE: Duterte accused of paying police to kill \nDuterte, 71, won a presidential election last year after promising during the campaign to eradicate drugs in society by killing tens of thousands of people . \nSince his inauguration on June 30, an anti-drug drive has seen more than 7,000 people killed over suspected drug links - with over 60 percent of the deaths carried out by unknown assassins. \nDe Lima has previously called for foreign intervention to put an end to the \"state-inspired\" extrajudicial murders, which she said have been instigated by Duterte since his election to power. \nDe Lima also led a series of Senate investigations over allegations that police officers were involved in the killings, and that hired killers were operating under orders from police. De Lima has branded President Duterte a \"sociopathic serial killer\" because of his drug war policy that has left more than 7,000 people dead [EPA File Photo] Trumped up charges \nDe Lima's supporters also insist she is innocent, and that the charges are trumped up to silence one of Duterte's most prominent critics. \nIn a statement to Al Jazeera, Senator Paolo Aquino condemned the \"political persecution\" of his fellow opposition Senate member. \n\"This arrest is purely political vendetta and has no place in justice system that upholds the rule of law. This is condemnable. Victims of Duterte's war on drugs \n\"We reiterate that an arrest based on trumped-up charges is illegal,\" he said citing the \"haste\" in de Lima's arrest. \nDe Lima previously claimed she was targeted because of her criticism of Duterte's drug war policy. \nDuring her time as head of the country's human rights body, de Lima also led the investigation into the alleged extrajudicial killings of an estimated 1,000 drug suspects in Davao, while Duterte was mayor of the city. \nWhen Duterte won as president in 2016, his feud with de Lima continued. \nAt one point he called on her to \"hang herself\", after he ordered prosecutors to investigate the senator's alleged links to the drug syndicate. \nThis week, de Lima branded the president a \"sociopathic serial killer\" after new allegations surfaced accusing Duterte of ordering drug killings in Davao.
