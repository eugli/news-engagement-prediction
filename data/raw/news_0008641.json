R. Lopez \nNeed dining inspiration for this coming weekend? Don't fret — Eater's here to help. \nEach week, the site's editors select a new group of restaurants and suggest them for various meals throughout the weekend. These picks range from brand new restaurants to old, reliable favorites. \nSome pair well with fun weekend activities; others reflect the recent news of the day or features on the site this week. Diners probably won't get to all five in one weekend, but that's what next weekend is for, right? \nFor an archive of all the previous choices for Eater's Five Restaurants to Try, head here . — Tierney Plumb FEBRUARY 3, 2017 \nFriday night: Dinner at Blue Duck Tavern \nChef Brad Deboy has been honing a whole roasted duck recipe for over a year. The by-request special ($110) summons a spice-crusted bird that's been dried, marinated, slow-cooked, glazed and crisped before hitting the table. Deboy can accommodate about a half-dozen orders a night (each duck takes roughly a week to prepare); those lucky enough to secure one should ask for a side of his earthy, house-made chili paste. Whole Roasted Duck [Park Hyatt Washington] \nSaturday Lunch: Doi Moi \nTry the newly-launched Bird's Eye Sandwich Shop, serving up hearty sandwiches, noodle soups, salads, and suds. Lunch runs 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturdays. (Check out Eater DC next week for an exclusive interview with Max Kuller , head of Doi Moi's parent company Fat Baby Inc.) Max Kuller [Tierney Plumb] \nSaturday Night: Tapas at Barcelona Wine Bar \nSince you'll already be on the hot 14th Street strip, might as well stay put. The popular wine bar just landed a new chef fresh out of NYC. Alex Urena [Barcelona Wine Bar] \nSunday lunch: Burger at Brookland's Finest \nThe eatery is just a couple hundred orders away from selling its 30,000th Colonel Burger; the sandwich is named after Colonel Brooks, who was an early 20th century developer of the Brookland neighborhood. The customer placing the 30,000th order will receive a golden safety pin, and a donation will be made in their name to the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, the Washington Jesuit Academy, or a charity of their choice. \nSuper Bowl Sunday: Video Games at Cotton & Reed \nThere are tons of local places to eat and drink while watching the Super Bowl , but Cotton & Reed is going against the grain. In lieu of showing the big game, the Union Market rum distillery will be open with a projector setup, playing Tecmo Bowl (NES) and Tecmo Super Bowl (SNES). Open from noon to midnight, with video games starting at 5 p.m. JANUARY 27, 2017 \nNew D.C. dumpling shop Laoban Dumplings will host its first pop-up event on Jan. 27 to ring in the Chinese New Year. The Passenger will host the festivities, with dumplings and karaoke going down at 8 p.m. The Passenger [Facebook] \nSaturday snacks: Boqueria \nEater DC's staff just had an outing at this Bib Gourmand winner in Dupont Circle. One hit was the Pintxo de Carne (grilled steak draped over country bread and drizzled with salsa verde). \nSaturday dinner: Red Apron Burger \nRight around the corner is the new burger bar from the folks at Neighborhood Restaurant Group. Efficiency is encouraged here, with a beer menu behind the register that replicates a split-flap display found at train stations. Red Apron Burger [Facebook] \nHide your drinking: Elixir Bar at Barrel \nD.C. is packed with hidden drinking treasures to seek out, and the basement bar at Barrel has made a splash not just with its cheeky cocktail list but with pop-up projects that have poked fun at our newly installed commander-in-chief. The most recent incarnation featured a Russian theme. \nSunday art walk: Ben's Chili Bowl \nGet a half-smoke and get inspired to vote for a new mural to go on the U Street staple, now that the one depicting now-former President Barack Obama and Bill Cosby has been freshly painted over . Could it be Ellen Degeneres? Jimmy Fallon? Marvin Gaye? The choice is ours. Ben's Chili Bowl [Roy Lewis] JANUARY 13, 2017 \nGet there first: Pamplona in Clarendon \nIt's opening week for the sexy sangria bar at 3100 Clarendon Blvd. The Social Restaurant Group's new 3,600-square-foot colorful space boasts a racy design with a running of the bulls theme and Basque country dishes from chef James Martin. Pamplona [R. Lopez] \nDrinks in the West End: Quadrant Bar & Lounge \nThe Ritz-Carlton's bar program is at the top of its game, thanks to the expert hands of cocktail master Chris Mendenhall. The Smoked Old Fashioned has a theatrical presentation, comprised of bourbon, house made smoked syrup, cherry bitters, and cedar smoke. And its new chef JJ Yang is whipping out an array of dishes that pair well with Mendenhall's drinks, including this week's new foie gras migas. Foie gras and a gin and tonic at Quadrant Bar & Lounge [Tierney Plumb] \nSaturday's \"hair\" of the dog: Sip and Dry Bar \nThe latest addition to the growing Hecht Warehouse lineup is a funky full bar-meets-salon setup, opening Saturday. Eleven drink-and-dry combos include The Klasique ($48): a martini paired with a \"time-honored blowout\" with volume and bounce. Definitely document the results in a selfie-friendly bathroom covered in pink flamingo wallpaper. The Whiskey Slap (Irish mojito) at Sip and Dry Bar [Tierney Plumb] \nSaturday dinner: Ari's Diner \nSince you're already in Ivy City, pop around the corner and try out new dinner dishes coming out of the kitchen, like the pastas that owner Mindful Restaurant Group (Ghibellina) is known for. The classic burger at Ari's Diner \nSunday's calm before the storm: Drinking on Capitol Hill \nInauguration week is in full swing , so it's probably time to start drinking heavily in the center of the storm. Do like Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi does and dine at Bistro Bis (she was spotted drinking pinot noir there Thursday night). And new Spanish hot spot Joselito Casa de Comidas is another fine option, with sherry for days. Joselito Casa de Comidas [R. Lopez] January 6, 2017 \nHappy Hour: Hilton Garden Inn at Capitol Hill \nDoesn't sound like much of a Friday night hot spot, but this NoMa hotel is always buzzing at happy hour with an eclectic mix of government employees, travelers and locals (like me). Food and drink deals, like $5 wine, go until 7 p.m. Bartender Mo (and co.) run the show at the second-story bar. \nGet there first: DCity Smokehouse \nThe barbecue joint just reopened this week in a bigger space on Florida Avenue, serving up the same meaty fare that first made it famous in 2013.

Lopez] \nSaturday brunch: The Bird \nThe new 11th Street spot has a crazy cool design, and The Bird's recently-hatched brunch menu includes wings and, of course, lots of egg dishes. \nSaturday night: Cocktails at Petworth Citizen \nThe cute Reading Room back bar boasts a big book collection (giving and taking is the loose policy) and bartender Chantal Tseng has a new lineup of literary-themed cocktails featuring sherry. Tseng [Facebook] \nSunday recharger: Drink at JRINK \nIt's supposed to be a big resolutions month--or something like that--so downing a healthy juice sounds about right (and the cold-pressed elixirs also fix hangovers ). Six locales in the D.C. area. DECEMBER 30, 2016 \nGet there first: Choolaah Indian BBQ \nThe Cleveland-based brand just opened this week inside Fairfax's Mosaic District, serving up chicken tikka masala, lamb meatball wraps, and more. Diners can watch meals being cooked before their eyes, with tandoor clay ovens grilling food at 700 degrees. Choolaah [Facebook] \nSaturday snack: Cookie time at Baked & Wired \nWith one more day until New Year's resolutions go into full swing, diets are still out the window. So splurge at this Georgetown spot, where the Lil Bertha consists of two oatmeal cookies with cream cheese frosting between. Cupcakes are also at the ready. Baked & Wired [Facebook] \nSaturday brunch: The Prospect \nJust in time for a huge drinking weekend, Eater posted a monster list of what dishes can cure hangovers fast. Here's another find on U Street: chef Josh Valencia's hangover-busting Chef's Killer Breakfast Sandwich with bacon, sausage, American cheese, hash browns, and mayo ($15). The Prospect [Official] \nNew Year's Eve: The Gibson \nThere are tons of ways to ring in 2017, from an Elvis revival at Archipelago to \"Happy New Beer\" at Bluejacket Brewery. The Gibson is going for \"The Future\" theme, inspired by flicks like \"A Clockwork Orange\" and \"The Fifth Element\"; for $130 , get an open bar, small bites, burlesque performances, and a champagne toast at midnight. Guests are encouraged to don futuristic frocks. The Gibson [Photo: Official] \nWarm Up: At Iron Gate \nNeighborhood Restaurant Group's romantic Dupont Circle spot not only boasts a festive winter patio with couches, but it's also a top stop for its fire pit. Cozy up with blankets and warm winter cocktails like It's Never Turkish, with amaro, coffee, whipped cream and coffee beans. On Jan. 1, brunch is served all day until 6 p.m. Iron Gate [Facebook] DECEMBER 16, 2016 \nGet there First: Tredici Enoteca \nThe St. Gregory Hotel's new restaurant Tredici Enoteca opened this week at 2033 M St. NW. Nosh on different parts of the Mediterranean, like this tasting board (a top seller at its sister spot in Philadelphia). Mediterranean Tasting Board at Tredici Enoteca \nFriday Night Drinks: Ten Tigers \nThe new replacement to Chez Billy in Petworth comes with an all-day menu from Kyrisan chef Tim Ma, with cocktails that won't break the bank. \nSaturday Splurge: The Next Whisky Bar \nD.C. has a bunch of cocktails right now that will break the bank , however. One is at The Watergate's The Next Whisky Bar: a $900 Manhattan that's made with a super rare Macallan spirit. The Macallan \"M\" at The Next Whisky Bar \nLate-night Saturday Snack: A slice at Duccini's Pizza \nEater recently embarked on a jumbo slice tour in Adams Morgan (while sober), and this U Street spot ranked at the top for its crispy crust and fresh mozzarella.

Lopez] \nSunday Night Dinner: Jaleo \nChef José Andrés is showcasing the orange for the holidays, which hits its peak season in Spain this time of year. As part of the annual Clementina Festival running through Dec. 23, ingest the juicy fruit in the clementine and octopus salad , seared clementines with goat cheese, or Clementine 75 ( Clementine juice, gin, cava, simple syrup, lime juice). Jaleo December 9, 2016 \nGet there First: Marcus \nMarcus Samuelsson's new D.C. restaurant has a Rat Pack-inspired bar called Sammy's, a killer sounding mac and cheese, and, because it's a D.C. restaurant from an out of town chef, a crab cake. Get there this weekend and get a first glance at the MGM National Harbor casino. \nFriday Night Drinks: The Shaw Bijou \nNot everyone can afford the tasting menu-centric's hefty price tag. But the new bar caters to walk-ins with expensive but not insane drinks and snacks. Plus, it has those fabulous chairs... The Shaw Bijou [R. Lopez] \nSaturday lunch: We The Pizza \nHey, if it's good enough for the First Lady. Spend Saturday grabbing a slice of Spike Mendelsohn's pizza, and get some holiday shopping done nearby — there are a lot of cool independent bookstores and speciality shops, like Hill's Kitchen and Labyrinth Games, plus Eastern Market, all nearby.
