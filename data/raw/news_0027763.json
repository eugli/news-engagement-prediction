Don't get bogged down in origin stories \n\"Lego Batman\" opens with an absolutely giant action sequence that showcases nearly every famous Batman villain you can think of. It's a brilliant way to kick off the film, and it quickly bring audiences into the story. 'The Lego Batman Movie' reviewed 'The Lego Batman Movie' builds the hero we deserve \nWhat it barely does, to its benefit, is try to explain who most of the villains are beyond a super-fast introduction. When Bane comes on, he immediately speaks in a voice reminiscent of his depiction in 2012's \" The Dark Knight Rises ,\" and that brings a fast familiarity to fans of Batman films. All I learned about Lego Catwoman is that she says \"meow\" a lot. And that's all anyone needs. \n\"Dawn of Justice\" stalled when it switched focus to Ezra Miller's Barry Allen/Flash, Jason Momoa's Aquaman and Ray Fisher's Cyborg. When \"Justice League\" officially forms, hopefully we can get the bare minimum of what we need to root for these heroes, and leave the rest of the character development to their standalone movies. \nOver in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, who didn't immediately fall in love with Tom Holland's Spider-Man debut during \" Captain America: Civil War \" -- all without even an ounce of that origin story? It's refreshing to see a film that trusts the audience already knows enough about these iconic heroes. 'The Lego Batman Movie' swings into action Why so serious? DC movies can be fun \nThe live-action DC movie universe so far isn't exactly known for its levity, but hopefully \"Lego Batman\" can help lighten things up. \nThe block version of Batman spends much of the film acting like a brooding loner, but he doesn't lose his sense of humor. Watching the hero heat up a lobster dinner and then gear up to watch his favorite romantic films by himself (all while still wearing the cowl) humorously nails the point that he prefers to be alone without making me sad about it. \nSimilarly, when other Lego superhero characters eventually make their appearance as part of a celebratory gathering, the movie revels in the campiness of having so many costumed figures in one place. \nHopefully the \"Justice League\" movie will draw on the fun factor of DC's Lego universe along with the \" The Flash ,\" \" Arrow \" and \" Supergirl \" TV shows, which are far less bleak than the movies. \nNow, I'm not expecting Ben Affleck's Batman to have words appear in the air when he throws punches, but maybe Henry Cavill's Superman can smile once in a while (when he's inevitably done being dead ). \nTech Culture : From film and television to social media and games, here's your place for the lighter side of tech. \nCNET Magazine : Check out a sampling of the stories you'll find in CNET's newsstand edition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:10:09.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
