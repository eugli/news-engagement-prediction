DIY Bath bombs are so easy to make, you'll never buy one again   \nBath bombs are basically God's gift to Earth after a long day, but buying a luxurious, well-crafted bomb is not-so-easy on the wallet. We're looking at you, LUSH. \nIt's not that LUSH bath bombs aren't totally addicting, it's just that we wince at the price tag every time we go to stock up. We love that LUSH uses simple, natural ingredients — which actually makes their bath bombs easy to duplicate at home for a fraction of the price. \nThis is a fun activity to do with kids, too, since it's basically playing in the sandbox — but with a fancier outcome. DIY bath bombs also make for awesome Valentine's Day gifts! You will need: 4 tablespoons cream of tartar 2-1/2 tablespoons oil (I used coconut but you can use olive or vegetable oil too) 2 teaspoons essential oil (lavender, jasmine, whatever you like!) Food coloring Directions: Step 1 \nIn a large bowl, add all dry ingredients (baking soda, cornstarch, epsom salts and cream of tartar) and whisk together. Step 2 \nIn a separate bowl, mix all wet ingredients, (oil, essential oil, food coloring (2-6 drops) and water. Step 3 \nNow slowly pour your liquid ingredient mix into the dry mixture, whisking them together slowly. The texture should be crumbly. Step 4 \nScoop a generous amount into your mold, packing it down. If you're using a plastic, fillable ornament, fill one side, then the other, then squeeze the halves together, wiping away excess mixture at the seam. If you want to add a little trinket or note inside the bath bomb, press it into one side of your ball. Step 5 \nTo release a bath bomb from the round mold, tap the outside mold shell with a spoon to loosen it. Then turn it over, and repeat the process with the other half. Step 6 \nLay your bath bombs out on a cookie sheet to dry overnight. \nThe fun part about DIY bath bombs is the customization! You can open a green tea bag and sprinkle in tea leaves, experiment with different essential oils, add real lavender or orange peel, and for the bravest of brave — microglitter. Have fun trying different colors and molds! \nIf you're giving these as gifts, some fun ways to package them are in little drawstring mesh bags, cellophane bags, inside cupcake papers or even several in a large Mason jar. \nBefore you go, check out our slideshow below: Image: Brandi Bidot/SheKnows \nOriginally published February 2015.
