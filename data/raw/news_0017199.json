Police are looking for the far-right owner of the “migrant horror” site. \nThe Migrantenschreck website was run by a Budapest-based company owned by far-right German activist Mario Roensch, 33, according to Die Zeit. Roensch comes from the city of Erfurt, where he organized several anti-refugee demonstrations in 2014. \nThe guns on sale were exported from Hungary, where they are legal, to Germany where they are not. \nREAD MORE: ‘Like a ghetto’: Leipzig condo fences itself off from refugee center \nAmong the offers were several models of air guns at prices between 229 and 749 euros ($244-799), crossbows and rubber bullets. One of the guns was called “Migrant deterrent DP120 Bautzen,” while another was dubbed “Anti-fascist deterrent,” according to German newspaper B.Z. \nThe rubber bullets fired by the weapons can do serious damage and even fatally wound a person. © MDR Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk / YouTube \nThe store said it was operating for the sake of “protecting yourselves and your families,” and promised to deliver the guns secretly “without annoying bureaucratic hurdles and irritating forms.” \nMigrantenschreck brought more than 100,000 euros to its owner over an eight-month period, between May and December 2016. An air revolver at a price of 349 euros ($376) is said to have been its best seller. \nGerman customs officers carried out raids in 11 of Germany’s 16 states on January 24 in search for illegal weapons purchased at Roensch’s online store. The officers managed to seize 42 weapons out of 300 that were reportedly ordered by Germans since May 2016. \nIt is believed the website’s owner took it offline once he learned of the operation.

Merkel: F**k u!” German police, however, suspect that Roensch could still be hiding in Hungary, Die Zeit reported. \nRoensch is also a founder of the Anonymous.Kollektiv page on Facebook that has promoted racism and discrimination and xenophobia. The well-known hacktivist group Anonymous has denied that it has any links to Roensch. The page garnered more than 2 million likes before it was shut down by the social media giant. \nIn June 2016, the magazine Compact, popular among the supporters of right-wing political party Alternative for Germany (AfD), featured ads for Migrantenschreck. However, in October Compact distanced itself from Roensch, who had reportedly worked for the magazine for at least two years. \n“We fired him at the beginning of summer 2016 in response to Roensch’s gun business,” the magazine said in an article. “We at Compact have warned about Roensch multiple times; he and his gun shop are dangerous.” \nIt could be difficult to prosecute Roensch for inciting hatred and selling guns in Germany, since the website was located on Russian and Hungarian servers. In those countries, the legislation works differently. \nThe German Criminal Code prohibits “incitement to hatred” and punishes offenders with a sentence of from three months to five years in prison.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:01:42.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
