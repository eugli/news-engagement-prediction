Paris Fashion Week starts as soon as Tuesday, so how could they resist spending a day at the happiest place on earth?\nThe sisters both Instagrammed the same photo of themselves posing with a very dapper Mickey Mouse. The women are decked out in matching Disneyland hats, and Gigi and Mickey are wearing matching Mickey hands. Mickey looks pretty happy to be making the Hadids&apos; acquaintance, though we have a feeling that&apos;s how he looks around all his fans. \"Mickey with fans today,\" Gigi captioned her version of the shot. \"Best day ever,\" Bella wrote alongside her upload.\nBella also shared a pretty hilarious photo from the haunted ride The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. On the ride, visitors take a spooky journey via an elevator through the Hollywood Tower Hotel, where they can visit a scary garden, library, hotel lobby, and more. She&apos;s tightly clutching Gigi and the friend next to her, while Gigi is mostly just holding on to her Mickey Mouse gloves. And for some reason, a pair of large red sunglasses were added on to Gigi&apos;s face during the photo-editing process. I mean, when you&apos;re a supermodel, you can pull off any look, right?\nOn top of multiple Fashion Weeks and trips to Disneyland, the Hadid sisters have had so much on their plates lately. Gigi has been working with Reebok as the face of its #PerfectNever campaign , and she recently collaborated with Tommy Hilfiger on her very own Barbie doll as well as the second iteration of her TommyxGigi line. Bella recently collaborated with Chrome Hearts on a fashion line called Chrome Hearts + Bella , and while she is committed to modeling for a while, she has plans to give acting a try in the future.\nTake a look at their adorable Instagram posts, below:\nLoading View on Instagram\nLoading View on Instagram", "external_links": ["http://www.self.com/story/gigi-hadid-reebok-this-or-that-video", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ-3AAuhPxy/?taken-by=bellahadid", "http://www.teenvogue.com/story/bella-hadid-says-she-wants-try-acting", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ-0nGlBg9J/?taken-by=bellahadid", "http://www.self.com/story/bella-hadid-gave-us-another-sneak-peek-of-her-upcoming-chrome-hearts-designer-collaboration", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ-1PorgmeC/?taken-by=gigihadid"], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:10:03.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
