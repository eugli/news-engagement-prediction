As George Orwell observed , human beings “don’t only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Hence that big military buildup after eight years of consistent no-drama common-sense: It’s one of those “intermittently” moments (we were about due). You’re sitting in the middle of the country sharpening dull needles with fingernail files to be sold on the street for $25, or taking too many prescription opioids to calm the nerves before a presentation, or taking the coating off an opioid and cooking it down to liquid form, and straining it and shooting it up, or trying to cope with a couple of foster kids and a criminal record — and hell the country looks ready for a shake-up.

Talk about the last cent! Now maybe Alex Cruz, the BA chief executive, is a smart guy, but whoever came up with the notion of charging BA customers for a “cuppa” is a fool intoxicated by the bottom line. Next there will be a charge for oxygen. \nAdvertisement No big deal, except that the system that produces such rip-offs is ripe for the furies. \nYou can follow me on Twitter ( @NYTimesCohen ) or join me on Facebook . \nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .
