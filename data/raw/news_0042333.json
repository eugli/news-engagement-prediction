THE GREAT PRECIOUS METALS MARKET DISCONNECT: A Ticking Time Bomb by SRSrocco - Feb 18, 2017 8:46 AM \nThe Great Precious Metals Market Disconnect that took place four years ago is now a ticking TIME BOMB Retired Green Beret Warns: Deep State's Utopia Of Oligarchs Is \"Enslavement And Complete Control Of All Of Mankind\" Feb 18, 2017 10:25 PM 0 SHARES \nSubmitted by Jeremiah Johnson (nom de plume of a retired Green Beret of the United States Army Special Forces (Airborne)) via SHTFPlan.com, \nIn past articles the fact of a long struggle was mentioned and how it ties in with the current first year of the President’s administration. The struggle is not merely to overcome the executive actions and orders of Obama. The true battle is to remove the Marxists from bureaucratic fiefs established by Obama for carryover into the current administration and to deflect and negate their attacks and the attacks of others. \nThe circuit court in San Francisco and the Department of Justice have been waging a seesaw-type of battle over the executive order signed by the President. The order’s intent is to stem the illegal aliens and foreigners entering the U.S. from Middle Eastern nations either openly hostile to or providing the highest probability (intentionally or indirectly) for terrorists to enter the country. This makes perfect sense, and because it does , one can easily see that only those hell-bent on weakening the U.S. and fostering infiltration would be against the order: those Marxists of the Left labeled as “Democrats” and calling themselves “Progressives.” \nThey are not alone: they are aided by the Left-Right, which is even worse . The Left-Right are those masquerading as Republican Conservatives, when they are Marxist-Leftists and proponents of Global Governance and the New World Order. They are the Paul Ryans, the Mitch McConnells, and the Newt Gingriches. They are the pseudo-Republican politico’s in office presently and in the past who have those CFR slots and are working toward their fantasy: The Utopia of Oligarchs. \nEven if they do not overtly act on behalf of the Marxists, they have been guilty…numerous times…of enabling the Marxists through the complacency of inactivity. \nThey do not simply wish to derail the actions of President Trump: it is a much larger concept than that. They see themselves as “partners” with the Left in the same game: to establish an elitist politico-oligarchic ruling class, broken down into divisions throughout the globe for ethno-cultural manipulation, yet with the same end-state. That goal is the enslavement and complete control of all of mankind with the elitists ensconced as the ruling moneyed class. They see themselves as the educated, sensible minority with tender sensibilities and true humanistic views…who must… must …take a stand in the globalist crusade against the barbaric Neanderthals of the proletariat and populist serfs. \nThis new President has taken more action and more rapidly than even President Reagan did when he took office, and that is saying something. Even those globalists playing the part of conservatives are knuckling under in lock step, shivering internally: A President is in the White House that can turn these bedbugs out of the mattress and burn them. This new President quietly and without fanfare made it a point to be there for the SEAL who was killed in Yemen as his casket was brought back home. \nThat should speak volumes on the caliber of the man who is in the White House. \nEverything that he does is attacked by the media and disparaged by the leftists. Even the removal of Dodd-Frank (let’s remember…that was Christopher Dodd and Barney Frank…two troglodytes…who came up with that one) is sneered at. The executive order to halt the illegals from potential hotbeds of Middle Eastern terrorism is challenged by states packed with liberals and also by the business and industry oligarchs who would rather the U.S. be vulnerable if they can continue to hire “tax-free”day-laborers for less than minimum wage with impunity. \nSenator John McCain (R- AZ) wants to go to war with Russia and he wants to reshape eastern Europe. McCain and Lindsey Graham were instrumental in the Obama-ordered and sanctioned coup d’état that brought down Ukraine’s government and president and installed a U.S. puppet picked by Victoria Nuland. McCain hasn’t stopped: he’s just been “on hold” to see where he can take footing when the dust settles from the initial Trump shakeup. \nIn previous articles, it was mentioned how critical this first 6 months to one year-period in office is for the President, namely because of the midterm elections. If the public does not see results, they could very well change the complexion and composition of Congress in 2018 and the Republicans could lose control of either one of or both houses of Congress. The President realizes this, and he is moving swiftly. \nThe public will also see that he is doing good things, and that it is the Democrats who are attempting to obstruct his efforts. This will carry the Republicans through in the midterm elections, and thus all legislative efforts by the President will be able to be enacted. It’s a tough fight and at times it’s uphill, but he started out well, and right…and the Democrats won’t be able to hold him off.
