Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nAnyone who spends any time on Twitter knows that one of the knee-jerk responses to any Trump scandal is to tweet, “But her emails!” \nNow that the election is in the books — even Jill Stein has given up trying to find enough votes to reverse it — plenty of Hillary Clinton supporters are revising history and suggesting that their candidate was merely sloppy with her record-keeping, and it cost her the presidency. But it was no accident that she set up that private email server that let her correspond with everyone, even the president himself , off the grid. \nSpeaking of being off the grid, the House Oversight Committee has sent a letter to new Attorney General Jeff Sessions regarding Clinton’s former IT aide, Bryan Pagliano, who went from pleading the Fifth to not showing up at all to testify before the House Oversight Committee. There’s someone who really doesn’t want to talk to investigators. OBSTRUCTIONBryan Pagliano, who in 2016 refused to testify before the House Oversight Committee, may be charged as a warning to others. \n— Joelon Wilson (@futureicon) February 18, 2017 Chaffetz seeks to charge ex-Clinton aide in email inquiry via the @FoxNews App https://t.co/Jusgfsost6 \n— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) February 17, 2017 Jason Chaffetz is asking AG Sessions to look into the staffer who helped set up Clinton's private email server https://t.co/TZAGir0dq0 pic.twitter.com/9WsAsbPbpl", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:22:54.226+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
