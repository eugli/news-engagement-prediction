(Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar) Buy Photo\nWith Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump’s pick for the U.S. Supreme Court, some abortion opponents have gained new hope they can one day ban the practice.\nAnd their opponents say the fight will be \"more challenging than ever.\"\nIn the wake of Trump's election, Rep. Curt Nisly, R-Goshen, proposed a ban on all forms of abortion in Indiana. The bill was shot down by leadership in the House, but it demonstrated a level of optimism not seen in recent years.\nNisly contends that the U.S. Supreme Court erred in its landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which effectively established a woman’s right to an abortion before viability of the fetus. He and many evangelical Christian conservatives hope that Trump's promise to appoint anti-abortion justices to the bench will upend more than 40 years of precedent.\nBut there remain a good many unknowns and, for now, Indiana's abortion opponents are falling back on their long-term strategy of proposing legislation that limits availability of the procedure.\nCurrently in Indiana there are three bills in the House and Senate that would restrict womens' access to abortion:\nSenate Bill 404 , authored by Sens. Erin Houchin, Travis Holdman and Jeff Raatz, would impose restrictions on minors seeking abortions by removing, in some cases, a judge’s ability to ensure their privacy. Along with requiring parental consent, the bill would make it a criminal offense for a physician or a religious leader to counsel a minor on whether or not to have an abortion. House Bill 1128 , authored by Rep. Ronald Bacon, would require that a pregnant woman be informed orally and in writing before a chemical abortion that the procedure could be reversed or stopped. Senate Bill 118 , authored by Sens. Dennis Kruse and Liz Brown, would require a mandatory ultrasound before an abortion, and, notably, the bill would require the pregnant woman to view the fetal ultrasound imaging and listen to fetal sounds. Currently women can opt out of this procedure. Opponents say the bills serve no medical purpose and their sole purpose is to restrict women's access to abortion. \"These bills are so unnecessary and don't contribute to the safety of the procedure,\" said Sue Ellen Braunlin, co-director of the Indiana Religious Coalition for Reproductive Justice.\n\"The bill affecting minors is really worrisome,\" Braunlin said, because it removes an opportunity for judges to waive parental notice for young women who are at-risk in their own home.\nLeadership of the Indiana Right to Life group declined to speak about proposed legislation \"until we know what's going to be heard and voted on,\" a spokeswoman for the organization told IndyStar.\nHowever, Mike Fichter, Indiana Right to Life President and CEO, said in an email to that he is pleased that Judge Gorsuch \"has recognized that a state has a right to defund abortion providers, like Planned Parenthood, of taxpayer money.\"\nAt 49, Gorsuch is the youngest Supreme Court nominee since Justice Clarence Thomas, and, if confirmed, he could rule on decisions affecting abortion policy and birth control for decades.\nWhile a judge on the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Gorsuch has never formally issued a ruling related to abortion rights, though he did rule in favor of Hobby Lobby in the famous 2013 birth control case. That decision recognized the company's opposition to providing contraceptives and abortion-causing drugs as required under the Affordable Care Act.\nGorsuch also has written about the “right to life,\" in the context of physician-assisted suicide. In his book \"The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,\" he supported: “the idea that human life is intrinsically valuable and that intentional killing is always wrong.”\nSaid Fichter: \"We urge the U.S. Senate to swiftly confirm Gorsuch.\" He added that Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Indiana, may be the deciding vote on Gorsuch. The group has launched a petition urging Donnelly to support his confirmation.\n\"Our ultimate desire is to see a Supreme Court with a majority of justices who affirm the right to life as one of our country's founding principles,\" Fichter said.\nLocal anti-abortion activists are preparing for a fight.\nPatti Stauffer, vice president of public policy for Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, is concerned about the nomination of Gorsuch, and added that she hopes the Indiana legislature will focus on \"working on crafting really good public policy opportunities.\"\n\"I don't have a crystal ball on what the future holds, and knowing that he has not had a record on abortion issue, I do know that he has been deemed fairly strict on the rule of law,\" Stauffer said.\nStauffer said Indiana is one of the most restrictive states towards abortion, and the legislature's approach of piecemeal restriction adds up to an inability to access abortion altogether.\n\"Indiana has a lot of issues that require immediate attention,\" Stauffer said. \"Further abortion restrictions is not one of them.\"\nCall IndyStar reporter Fatima Hussein at (317) 600-4659.
