(Brian Crooks, City of Naperville) Suzanne Baker Police Chief Robert Marshall and former Naperville resident Brian Crooks was more than a half a year in the making.\nAfter communicating for months via phone and email, Marshall finally sat down with the man who shed a national light on what it was like to grow up in a predominantly white community, like Naperville. \nNow living in Iowa, Crooks graduated from Gregory Middle School and Neuqua Valley High School in Naperville. He came to Marshall's attention in July when Crook's essay about growing up black in the Midwest posted to Facebook went viral and was picked up by news outlets across the country. \nAt that time, the police chief reached out to Crooks about getting together to talk. \nCrooks said he thought it was a nice gesture and figured the invitation would get lost in the shuffle. To his surprise, Marshall continued to stay in touch via email and kept pushing for a sit-down meeting. \n\"He stayed with it. That says a lot about the man; it says a lot about his character,\" said Crooks, who was in town over the weekend to visit family. \n\"My hope was to meet him face to face,\" Marshall said. \"When you talk to people over the phone or through email, you miss some of the aspects of conversation,\" whether it's the inflection in a person's voice or being able to look the other person in the eye, he said. \n\"I just find in-person communication so much better. There's just a connection you can't get on the phone or with email,\" he said. \nBoth men said Sunday's conversation was positive, and they hugged and left fully expecting to stay in touch. \n\"I came away with a better understanding,\" Marshall said. \nCrooks said he was able to hear about the programs Marshall has implemented as chief to improve relations in the city. \nMarshall said gave Crooks a copy of the strategies Naperville instituted based on former President Barack Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. Outgrowths have included crisis intervention, the Connect For Life program that addresses heroin addiction, measures to de-escalate conflict, and an upcoming bias training. \nDuring the more than an hour discussion, Crooks said the two talked about how de-escalation might have prevented some of the property damage during a recent protest on the University of California Berkeley campus if police had not showed up in full riot gear. \nCrooks said the chief explained how Naperville police, on a much smaller scale, tone down responses to downtown bars late at night because the sights and sounds of multiple police cars can cause emotions to flare. \nThe Iowan also was impressed how police in Naperville and Aurora will attend sessions to help them assess their implicit and explicit biases. Marshall said management and supervisors from both departments will go through the training in April and the officers will take part later dates. \nCrooks said the lessons will go a long way to helping break down the basis for officers' biases. \nPeople often jump to the conclusion that if a person has bias, they are a racist, which in not the case, Crooks said. \nMuch of the bias, he said, is based on how a person grew up and the beliefs of parents, grandparents and other relatives and friends. \n\"The first step is to acknowledge that everyone has bias,\" he said. \"You can't confront biases and plan to solve them, if you don't think they exist.\" \nAmong Crooks' comments in his essay was that he was he was stopped by local police some 70 times from 2001 to 2007. He maintains he was stopped more frequently than his high school peers because he was black. \nSome members of Naperville's police union took Crooks' remarks personally and openly disputed his characterization that police pulled him over frequently. \nThat in turn caused Crooks to warn his parents, who still live in Naperville, to take extra care. \nCrooks said the conversation with the police chief helped dispel the negativity he felt. \n\"He genuinely comes off a good person who wants to leave Naperville a better place than when he started,\" Crooks said. \"He definitely addressed my concerns.\" \nThe Iowan said he feels more \"hopeful and validated\" and that Naperville is moving in the right direction. \n\"It feels good. It feels like the negativity is reduced. In the end it's safer for both the citizens and officers,\" he said. \nTwitter @SBakerSun1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:58:23.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
