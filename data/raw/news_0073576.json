The Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus are not exactly the most affordable devices out there, but that was to be expected, these two phones are Huawei’s all-new flagship devices. That being said, Huawei had introduced one Huawei P10 variant, and two Huawei P10 Plus models. The Huawei P10 handset comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of native storage, and it will cost €649. The Huawei P10 Plus, on the other hand, comes in both 4GB RAM + 64GB storage variant, and also 6GB RAM and 128GB storage model. The former will cost €699, while you’ll have to splash out €799 if you’d like to get the most expensive Huawei P10 Plus variant. Both the Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus will become available in March in a number of countries around the world, not in the US though. \nThese two devices are quite similar, though there are some considerable differences between them. The Huawei P10 comes with a 5.1-inch fullHD display, while its larger sibling sports a 5.5-inch QHD panel. Both devices are fueled by the same SoC, the Kirin 960, Huawei’s flagship processor. These two phones also come with the same camera sensors, on the back of the two devices you’ll be able to find a dual camera setup, 12-megapixel and 20-megapixel shooters are placed there, along with the dual-LED, dual-tone flash. Those camera sensors ship with Leica’s lenses on top of them, just as Huawei Mate 9’s cameras did, same goes for the Huawei P9 and Huawei P9 Plus as well, though Huawei’s new phones also ship with an 8-megapixel front-facing camera which is also protected by one of Leica’s lenses, which was not the case with the Huawei Mate 9, or any other smartphone for that matter. \nAs far as software is concerned, you’ll be glad to hear that the two devices come with Android 7.0 Nougat , the latest variant of Google’s operating system. On top of it, however, you’ll get Huawei’s very own skin called Emotion UI (EMUI) 5.1, which was actually released along with these two phones.
