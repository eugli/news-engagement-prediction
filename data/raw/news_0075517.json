He will rebel against Theresa May Credit: PA \nA Labour Lords source said the party \"would be likely to win handsomely\" and inflict defeat on the Government on the issue, as well as in a bid to guarantee rights of EU nationals already in the UK. \nA vote on whether Parliament should have a meaningful say on the final deal is not expected during the European Union (Notification Of Withdrawal) Bill's committee stage next week, but is more likely during report stage on March 7, the source said. \nWriting in The Mail On Sunday, Lord Heseltine said: \"In the end the outcome of Brexit will have to be confirmed by Parliament. \n\"It will also have to pass in 27 national European parliaments, several sub-national parliaments and the European Parliament. The proposals would give Parliament the final authority over a Brexit deal Credit: PA \n\"It was perhaps unwise for our Government to suppose that our Parliament should be excluded where all others were included. \n\"Very sensibly, after the Supreme Court interpreted the law, that position was reversed and Parliament was restored to its rightful constitutional role as the ultimate authority. \n\"I will vote in the House of Lords to ensure that position is legally intact. \"This is not a confrontation with the Government which has already made such a commitment. \n\"It is, put simply, a decision to ensure that the Commons has the chance to define its role in the exercise of its authority over what most people regard as the defining issue of our time.\" Last updated Sat 25 Feb 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:04:38.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
