Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nSally Kohn has taken to posting a #DailyActofResistance over on her timeline with today’s asking her followers to call their senators to protest Neil Gorsuch because he founded a “friggin fascism fan club” in high school: Get on this people. We need Supreme Court judges who are a check on fascism, not fans of it! #DailyActOfResistance #StopGorsuch ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿 pic.twitter.com/W2esEACmwr \n— Sally Kohn (@sallykohn) February 3, 2017 \nAs everyone knows by now , there’s nothing to this story. And if you don’t believe us, check with Snopes who found it “false”: @sallykohn @NekoCase No fan of Gorsuch, but let's get 'em on the facts! Or do you know something Snopes doesn't? https://t.co/zjv6Gak1dD \n— Ryan Spain (@RyanSpain) February 3, 2017 Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:15:13.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
