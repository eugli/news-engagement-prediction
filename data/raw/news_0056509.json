Perhaps that’s the thinking for Warner Bros., which is in negotiations with The LEGO Batman Movie director Chris McKay to helm a DC movie based on Nightwing, the vigilante identity adopted by the original Robin, Dick Grayson. Bill Dubuque ( The Accountant ) is writing the script for the studio. \nNo start date has been announced. The Hollywood Reporter first broke the news. \nMcKay, an animator who worked on three seasons of Robot Chicken prior to teaming up with Christopher Miller and Phil Lord on The LEGO Movie , will be returning to the Dick Grayson character after debuting him in LEGO Batman in plastic brick form. \nDick Grayson, a character who first appeared in the 1940s, created the alter-ego Nightwing in a 1984 comic after he left Batman’s fold to become a superhero all his own. Nightwing has yet to appear in any of the DC movies. The next film from that cinematic universe to hit theaters will be this summer’s Wonder Woman , set to bow on June 2, which will be followed by The Justice League on Nov. 17. \nThe LEGO Batman Movie has earned $182 million worldwide since opening on Feb. 10. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:38:05.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
