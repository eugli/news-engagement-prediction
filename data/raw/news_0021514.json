As soon as tiger came for food, the door was locked as per the plan,\" the official said, adding that this made Snehasis angry and it kept roaring for a day. \n\nMeanwhile, another his partner Sheela now got chance to move out of the cage for the safari. \n\n\"After four days Sheela was allowed in the park. It moved here and there, took rest under the shadow of tree and drank water from the pond,\" the official said. \n\nForest officials are also worried if Sheela too does what Snehasish did few days back. \n\nLast month, a full grown male tiger Snehasis along with his partner Sheela were brought from Odisha's Nandankanan Zoological Park to Kolkata's Alipore Zoological Gardens for Bengal Safari. \n\nOn January 23, Snehasis and Sheela were allowed to roam in an open cage by the Zoological Park authorities for tourist attraction. The authorities were with the notion that the tiger will return to the cage in the evening but that didn't happen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:24:26.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
