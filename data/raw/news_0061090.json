Let's get it out in the open that majority of us Filipinos love having a great time. We love the sensation of being happy and just relaxing while we enjoy our own cuisine. A lot of us prefer these gatherings to being in the comfort of our homes. On those weekends, we invite friends over and sing songs; share stories, laugh and be merry. It also goes without saying that most of us love to go out and be the life of the party. In a city such as Dubai, however, Filipino hangouts are few and far in between. But there's a new place in town catering to the kabayans of Dubai. Award winning American-themed bar, Speakeasy at Ramada Plaza Jumeirah Beach, unveiled its first ever Pinoy Night this Tuesday and we they're serving up the best of our home-grown dishes. Elevate your dining experience with a selection of unlimited homegrown Pinoy dishes that change on a weekly basis, so there's always something new to try, with popular favourites frequenting the menu such as binagoongan, afritada, kare-kare, bicol express or lumpiang shanghai, served right at your table while chilling with the groovy beats of DJ Keith Dobbs. Pair this wondrous spread with the well-loved tangy side dish, achara (pickled green papaya) to break the heaviness of the meaty feast. Leave room for desserts though as the delectable leche flan, fruit salad or cassava cake will surely not disappoint the Pinoy's sweet tooth! But the Pinoy Night is not just for merrymakers. Those who feel the need to indulge in some dishes from home can also make themselves comfy. Ramada Plaza is even encouraging other nationalties to come and sample Filipino cuisine!
