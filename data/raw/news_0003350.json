It’s made out of a hydrogel — a polymer gel that’s more than 90 percent water by weight. Light and sound waves pass through it just like they would pass through water, which makes it nearly undetectable underwater, according to a paper published today in Nature Communications . \nUsually, hydrogels are too flimsy to move with any sort of speed or force without falling apart. That’s why soft robots are typically made of silicones — but silicones are easy to see. So a team of scientists at MIT figured out a new formulation of chemicals that, when cured with UV light, make much tougher, but still flexible, hydrogel robots. \nUsing 3D printed and laser-cut molds, the scientists formed hydrogel parts that they then assembled into the goldfish-grabbing claw, a leg that could kick a ball, and an invisible fish that could flip its tail back and forth. \nWhen syringes pump pre-programmed volumes of water at specific intervals, water rushes through the little channels inside each of the robots — making them grab, kick, or swim. It only takes a second for them to move as much as less advanced hydrogel robots moved in 20 hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:34:40.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
