A Kentucky spokesperson confirmed neither Fox nor Adebayo, who were both passengers, was hurt in the crash. The two players were receiving a ride to the Kentucky campus. Shortly after the accident, they left the scene in another vehicle and arrived at the Joe Craft Center, where they talked with police. Fox and Adebayo have been key players for the Wildcats in 2016-17. Fox is the team's second-leading scorer (15.7 points per game) and sits second in assists (5.4 per game). Adebayo is averaging 12.9 points per game and is first in rebounds (6.9) and blocks (1.6).
