The singer shared her happy news by posting a vaguely bridal image of herself kneeling in front of a blooming arch of flowers, decked out in a green gauzy veil, holding her growing baby bump. The image was captioned, “We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters.” The result? The image was an instant, Internet-breaking hit. Twitter erupted with a series of hilarious memes , and outlets around the world (including this one ) quickly reported the news. Given Beyoncé’s tendency to decline to give interviews (she’s rarely given one in the last three years), it’s no huge surprise that Queen Bey would opt to directly share the fact that she is expecting with her large and loyal fan base. And while she is far from the only celebrity circumventing the traditional PR-to-interview routes of communications these days, she is the ultimate pioneer of this shift. Beyoncé is nothing if not always in control of her own image, and this post proved exactly that. Loading View on Instagram But if Beyoncé changed the way music albums are released with the surprise drop of her eponymous 2013 “visual album,” will she now do the same thing for baby announcements with this photograph? People announcing pregnancies, births, and engagements on social media is nothing new. Neither is the idea that one would hire a professional photographer to take said shots. But while social media baby announcements often employ a somewhat cutesy-but-memorable tactic (think blue balloons to indicate that the couple is expecting a boy, or a cake with a pink interior if it’s a girl), they pale in comparison to the sense of drama reflected in Bey’s post. What was, after all, the thing that really got people talking about Beyoncé’s Instagram today? The fact that the image in question was so utterly, undeniably unique. And that, somewhat illusive quality, may indeed be what expectant couples are more and more looking to capture. Green veils, optional.
