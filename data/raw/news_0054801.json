Chris Sununu. –Charles Krupa / Associated Press By AP, 11:09 AM \nGet Boston Globe's Political Happy Hour newsletter , your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. \nCONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A license is no longer required to carry hidden loaded guns in New Hampshire. \nRepublican Gov. Chris Sununu has signed legislation removing the licensing requirement for carrying concealed firearms. A representative from the National Rifle Association says that makes New Hampshire the 12th state that doesn’t require a license or permit. \nNow anyone who isn’t prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a gun can carry it concealed without a license. The previous law gave police chiefs and local officials the discretion to decide if someone was “suitable” to carry a gun concealed. \nSupporters say the bill restores gun owners’ constitutional rights. But opponents worry it will allow dangerous people to carry hidden guns. \nSununu said Wednesday signing the bill is “a long time coming.” His Democratic predecessor vetoed it.
