We’re underdogs, but we’re strong and want to show our football.” \n0041 hrs IST: Some stats as we wait for kick-off: \n23 – Sevilla have not lost any of their last seven home games, scoring 23 goals in the process \n289 – Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico has not conceded a goal in 289 minutes of football \n0025 hrs IST: All done in the Europa League games. No more goals added from the last update. Manchester United through to last-16 with a 4-0 win on aggregate. Schalke and Krasnodar join them in moving forward \n0021 hrs IST: Starting lineups (Porto vs Juventus) \nPorto: Casillas – Pereira, Marcano, Felipe, Telles – Danilo, Neves, Herrera, Brahimi – Soares, Silva \nJuventus: Buffon; Lichtsteiner, Barzagli, Chiellini, Alex Sandro; Khedira, Pjanic; Cuadrado, Dybala, Mandzukic; Higuain \n0017 hrs IST: Starting lineups (Sevilla vs Leicester City) \nSevilla: Sergio Rico; Mariano, Lenglet, Rami, Escudero; N’Zonzi, Nasri; Sarabia, Correa, Vitolo; Jovetic. \nLeicester City: Schmeichel, Simpson, Morgan (c), Huth, Fuchs, Albrighton, Drinkwater, Ndidi, Musa, Mahrez, Vardy \n0012 hrs IST: Meanwhile plenty of football in Europe tonight with an hour until kick-off in the Champions League. Nearing full time in the second leg of Europa League where Manchester United are on the verge of moving forward. They lead 1-0 against St. Etienne with a goal by Henrik Mkhitaryan and are 4-0 up on aggregate. In the other two games, Fenerbahce and Krasnodar are 1-1 with the Russian side leading 2-1 on aggregate; Schalke and PAOK Thessaloniki FC are 1-1 on the night too but the German side are 4-1 ahead on aggregate. In league football, Real Madrid went down 2-0 in the first ten minutes to Valencia, as Simone Zazza scored a peach of a goal, before Cristiano Ronaldo draw them back with the game at half time right now. \n0010 hrs IST: Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Champions League. Today’s action sees Sevilla host Leicester City and Juventus travel to Porto. Last night we saw an astonishing 14 goals with Manchester City beating Monaco 5-3 and Bayer Leverkusen going down 2-4 to Atletico Madrid. I would eat my hat if we have the same flurry of goals happen once again tonight. \nThings are going incredibly woefully for the English Premier League champions Leicester City. They are languishing near the drop zone in the league, were sent out of the FA Cup over the weekend and to make matters even worse, they are finding it tough to find the back of the net. They’ve been unable to find the goal in the last six of eight games with just five goals coming in this process – both against Derby County. Their opponents tonight – Sevilla are trying to replicate their heroics of Europa League into the Champions League. After three straight Europa League titles, they are hoping to make the quarterfinals with a good start at Sanchez Pizjuan. \nIn the other game on the night, two giants of European football and behemoths of their respective nations come together in what is likely to be a cagey affair. Porto host Juventus and that will also see another meeting of the goalkeeping legends Iker Casillas and Gianluigi Buffon. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Best of Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:29:07.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
