Related Stories \nKhulna transport strike withdrawn \n\"There is no question of lifting the strike,\" Bangladesh Road Transport Workers' Federation General Secretary Osman Ali told bdnews24.com on Monday night. \nThe organisation's regional chapter went on the indefinite strike in 10 districts from Sunday after a Manikganj court ordered life imprisonment for a bus driver over a 2011 road crash that killed celebrated filmmaker Tareque Masud, ATN News CEO Mishuk Munier and three others. \nKhulna Deputy Commissioner Nazmul Ahsan sat with the striking workers' representatives on Monday afternoon. \nAfter the meeting at the Khulna Circuit House, which lasted for over one and a half hours, Ahsan said the authorities advised the transport workers to move the High Court. \n\"There's nothing do to about the court's verdictâ€¦They agreed to withdraw the strike after the administration assured them of cooperation,\" he said. \nBut several workers' leaders later confirmed bdnews24.com that they had not withdrawn the strike. \nChuadanga District Bus, Truck Road Transport Workers' Union General Secretary Ripon Mondol said, \"The strike may have been withdrawn from Khulna, but we haven't. Our buses won't operate on the roads.\" \nThe Federation's Khulna regional committee President Azizul Islam Mintu said, \"We've called the strike... How does the district administration withdraw it?\" \nAsked about the workers' denial, Deputy Commissioner Ahsan said they are 'traitors'. \n\"The withdrawal was decided in the meeting and it was publicly announced. Now they are saying the strike has not been withdrawn. This is traitorous,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:09:26.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
