Say you landed a date to prom with the most popular girl in school and then, instead of dancing with you, she makes you dance with her mother , who is also there for a reason. Who knows why? Maybe chaperoning. And what if the date was not the most popular girl in school, but Star Wars princess Carrie Fisher? And it wasn’t prom, but Hollywood’s prom, the Academy Awards. And it wasn’t some P.T.A. president whose arms you’re thrown into, but Debbie Reynolds, song and dance film legend? That would be a good story to have in your back pocket for every dinner party hence. The Hollywood Reporter published entertainment industry veteran Tom Coleman’s story of escorting the then-21-year-old Fisher to the 1978 Oscars, when the first Star Wars swept nearly all the categories in which it was nominated. He writes that it was at the after-party at the Hilton that Reynolds approached and asked to be introduced, which is when Fisher quipped, “Mother, this is Tom, the man I have been living with for six months!” Coleman followed with how that magic moment with Debbie Reynolds came to be: \nCarrie then said to her mother, \"Tom has been wanting to dance all evening, but these new shoes are killing me — would you mind?\" And that's how it came to be that I waltzed with the extraordinary woman who had danced with Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and other greats. She was lovely and made me feel like Astaire.” The night ended in Richard Dreyfuss’s apartment at 3 A.M., where Fisher and Coleman sat surrounded by luminaries including George Lucas and John Belushi.
