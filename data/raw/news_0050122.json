(There is also no word for “citizenship.”) The current border barriers have three gates that open regularly for family reunions and ceremonies like the Vikita (pronounced WHI-kih-tha), celebrated every summer to mark the tribal new year, and religious pilgrimages 60 miles into Mexico. Those who live on the Mexican side have border-crossing cards authorizing them to visit the tribe’s American side, but not to stay or work in the United States, or leave the reservation. The Border Patrol has checkpoints on each of the roads leading out of the reservation, where a tribal member who is a Mexican citizen could be detained and deported, Mr. Saunders said. Because of tribal rights, building a wall across the lands of the Tohono O’odham Nation would most likely require an act of Congress, according to Monte Mills, co-director of the Margery Hunter Brown Indian Law Clinic at the University of Montana. But the Supreme Court has held that, in considering whether to act in ways that have an impact on Native Americans, Congress must partake in a “detailed consideration of tribal interests,” Mr. Mills said. Last week, Mr. Manuel and Mr. Jose met with Homeland Security officials in Washington to ask for a seat at the table. Photo The tribe’s chairman, Edward D. Manuel, at its headquarters in Sells, Ariz.

Still, many Native Americans saw the president’s swift decision to resume work on the Dakota Access oil pipeline — which President Barack Obama had halted after protests at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota — as a sign that the new administration would be less deferential to their sovereignty. As the sun set on Friday, dozens of Tohono O’odham members filled the Legislative Council chambers at the White House, the building in Sells that is home to the tribal government, for a community meeting about the border wall. Inside, volunteers registered people to vote and instructed them on how to write letters to the state’s congressional delegation. “If we have a wall, it will separate our people,” said the meeting’s main organizer, April Ignacio, 34, in an interview outside the building. \nAdvertisement She then brought up another possibility that filled her with dread. “If we don’t have a wall and other parts of the border have, the cartels will funnel everything through here,” she said. “What will that do to us?” Photo David Lopez, left, and Frank Martinez, members of the Tohono O’odham Nation, stoking a fire used for prayer outside a meeting in Sells.
