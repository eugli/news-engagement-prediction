Close Williamson channels Howard with bowling shocker UP NEXT VIDEO Williamson channels Howard with bowling shocker \nThe Black Caps captain had the calamitous moment during his side's tense loss in the first one-day match against South Africa in Hamilton. \nWilliamson inserted himself into the bowling attack, but he's probably wishing he hadn't after sending down a woeful spinner that bounced twice before reaching the batsman. Williamson tried out the rarely seen double bouncer tactic.

The Kiwi skipper saw the funny side of things after the match. Pic: Getty \n\"It was quite effective today!\" Williamson joked. \"I clipped my leg and I didn't want to let go of it. \n\"But it was a dot ball - that's the main thing!\" \nWilliamson top-scored for his side with the bat, clubbing 59 runs to help New Zealand reach 7/207. \nBut the Proteas got home with one ball to spare after an unbeaten 37 from AB de Villiers and a 69 from Quinton de Kock. \nWilliamson can even console himself with the fact that his delivery wasn't the worst ever seen on the international stage. \nThat 'honour' would almost certainly have to be bestowed upon Ravindra Jedeja, whose awful delivery in a Test match against England was so bad it defied logic.
