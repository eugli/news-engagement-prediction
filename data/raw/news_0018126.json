The remark followed Rockwall County Sheriff Harold Eavenson criticizing an unnamed state senator who believes police shouldn’t receive forfeiture money unless a case ends in conviction. \nTrump responded: “Who is the state senator? Do you want to give his name? We’ll destroy his career.” \nThe sheriff wouldn’t say and it was unclear to whom Eavenson was referring. \nRepublican state Sen. Konni Burton has proposed the most sweeping forfeiture reforms but wouldn’t stop to answer questions outside the Senate on Tuesday. \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.   rewritten or redistributed.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:39:36.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
