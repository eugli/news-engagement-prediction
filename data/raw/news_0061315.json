Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nFeminist and Democratic candidate for congress Brianna Wu says the Left holds themselves to a higher standard … BAHAHA! There is no equivalent of Milo on the left because we hold ourselves to higher standards. Our Milo wannabes get ostracized pretty quickly. \n— Brianna Wu (@Spacekatgal) February 22, 2017 \nOh man. \nOk, so most people on the right disagreed with and even condemned Milo for allegedly attempting to normalize pedophilia. And he was also disinvited from CPAC, lost his book deal and then ended up resigning from Breitbart. \nThat would tell you that even if Milo was a conservative (he’s not), people on the right ostracized him pretty quickly. \nThe Left seems to protect their own horrible people. \n— David Edward (@_David_Edward) February 22, 2017 \nOops. @Spacekatgal Higher standard? You Lefties had a Women's March dedicated to taxpayer funded abortion. Your entire party is Milo. \n— Stewart Hanson (@Jaystew17) February 22, 2017 Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:05:47.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
