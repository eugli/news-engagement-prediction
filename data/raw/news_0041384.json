Photo: Peter Swoop, Newcastle Herald \nI'd suggest they are not. Players have rarely had so much support around them. But it's clear that there can never be enough. \nIn rugby league, several young players have taken their own life in recent years. And then, last December, former Parramatta and Roosters player Chad Robinson was lost after a long battle with depression. \nABC broadcaster Craig Hamilton has been a mental health crusader since 2000 when he suffered a manic episode at Broadmeadow train station en route to cover the Sydney Olympics. When he's not calling rugby league, he is often crossing the country talking about mental health. \nWhen I phoned him on Monday, he was on his way to Central Queensland on a speaking tour with retired star Preston Campbell. \n\"When they are players, they become a person they think they are,\" Hamilton said. \"When they retire, they ask: who am I?\" \nIn other words, players are given superhero powers for 10 years, maybe more. And then it's suddenly taken away – the money, the physicality, the perfectionism – and the void can't be filled. \nYears ago, former coach Warren Ryan was in conversation with Broncos prop Shane Webcke, who admitted to struggling when he retired from playing. \n\"You need something to retire to ,\" Ryan said, \"not something to retire from .\" \nAfter a long pause, Webcke said: \"That's probably the most profound thing I've ever heard.\" \nBut sometimes having something to retire to isn't enough, and on that score you can look at Grant Hackett. \nHe left the pool as an Olympic hero, and straight into a suit and tie and a high-ranking job at Westpac. He had a gig at Channel Nine and speaking engagements coming from all corners. \nBut none of that replaced the structure and discipline that came with eyeballing the black line at the bottom of the pool every morning. \nLast Thursday night, Roosters halfback Mitchell Pearce fronted the Banksia Project's mental health lectur e at the University of NSW. Having turned his life around in the space of the year, Pearce feels it's necessary to give a little back. \nSome readers lazily dismissed the ensuing story – which wasn't solicited by Pearce or the club – as a cliched tale of redemption, but if they'd read it he actually had a warning. \n\"The war never stops,\" Pearce said. \nIt's a war that's never going to be won, but Hamilton argues the best way to fight it is by talking about it. \n\"I don't know how many phone calls I've had over the years from professional sportspeople,\" he says. \"I've never quoted them, never told anyone about those conversations but they've all said: I am really struggling. And they haven't told no one. \n\"It's important to let them speak to people who have been to hell and back. These were my symptoms. I wasn't sleeping. I couldn't eat. I had total social isolation. The normal things that made me happy no longer made me happy. I had dark thoughts. Then I had suicidal thoughts … I honestly don't know many players in professional sport have heard those stories; the confronting, personal stories about what it's like to battle mental illness. Those stories need to be told, they need to be heard.\" \nLifeline 13 11 14 www.lifeline.org.au \nSuicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467 www.suicidecallbackservice.org.au \nMensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78 www.mensline.org.au \nYou can follow Andrew Webster on Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:24:38.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
