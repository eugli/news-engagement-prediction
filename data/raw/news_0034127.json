Hart—best known for her massively popular My Drunk Kitchen series, which is pretty much exactly what it sounds like—has signed a first-look deal with the studio, with her prospective first feature being billed as an LGBTQ romance. \nHart previously starred in the film Dirty 30 , with fellow YouTubers Grace Helbig and Mamrie Hart. She’s also the author of two popular books, My Drunk Kitchen and Buffering: Unshared Tales Of A Life Fully Loaded , and is currently in production on a travel show for Food Network. Hart currently has roughly 5 million followers across all forms of social media, and—we can’t stress this enough—hasn’t made any jokes about murdering all the Jews recently, at least as far as we know. (Admittedly, we’re kind of grading on a curve at this point.) \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T11:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:55:18.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
