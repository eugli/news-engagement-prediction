After Chris Chiozza and Thornwell traded free throws on each end, Devin Robinson gave Florida its largest lead of the game when he knocked down a three from the corner for a 73-59 advantage. After two more Thornwell free throws, Allen drew a foul on a three-point attempt and then converted on all three for a 76-61 advantage with 4:43 remaining.\nAfter Chiozza scored on a long jumper and Kasey Hill took it to the rim for a layup, Florida held an 80-62 lead with 3:33 left.\nTHEY STOLE THE SHOW: Allen was aggressive and dominant offensively from the get-go Tuesday night, finishing with 26 points on 5-of-7 shooting (3-of-5 from three, 13-of-14 on free throws) to go along with a career-best seven rebounds, three assists and two steals. Allen was responsible for 12 of Florida’s first 22 points of the contest, showing hustle from when the ball was tipped off to log six points and four rebounds in less than five minutes of action.\nRobinson was also impressive Tuesday night. The junior forward recorded 14 points on 5-of-9 shooting, making some timely threes en route to 3-of-6 shooting from downtown, while adding six rebounds.\nTHESE STATS DON'T LIE: After going 0-of-17 from three at South Carolina on Jan. 18, Florida went 9-of-19 (47.4%) from downtown on Tuesday while shooting 49% from the field. The Gators also made 22-of-27 (81.5%) free throws, behind Allen’s 13-of-14 clip. Meanwhile, South Carolina shot just 39.3% from the field and 3-of-14 (21.4%) from three.\nFlorida committed 12 turnovers in the first half, but just four in the second half as the Gators eventually pulled away.\nWith two assists Tuesday night, Hill moved to second place in assists in program history, passing Donnie Montgomery with 505 assists. Erving Walker is still No. 1 with 547.\nWHAT A PLAY: Following a 17-2 South Carolina run, Florida responded with five quick points to close out the first half – and a key dunk by Allen with 20 seconds left played a part in that. After coming up with a steal on the defensive end, Allen was off to the races in the fastbreak and then heaved the ball over to Chris Chiozza down the floor. While in the air catching the pass, Chiozza dished it back over to Allen, who finished with a two-handed slam for the 35-33 Florida lead right before halftime.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: Against one of the top defensive squads in the country, Florida managed to finish with efficient shooting numbers and hang 81 points while hitting nine threes – nine more than in both teams’ previous meeting on Jan. 18. It was an impressive effort by a banged-up Gators squad – and SEC coach of the year honors are looking more and more likely for White after this latest victory.\nNEXT UP: No. 13 Florida and No. 11 Kentucky will square off on Saturday at Rupp Arena in Lexington in a 2 p.m. ET game that will air on CBS – a game that could end up determining the SEC regular-season champion. Kentucky (22-5, 12-2 SEC) squares off against Missouri tonight in a game that started at 9 p.m.\nAfter Saturday’s contest, Florids will return home for Senior Night against Arkansas next Wednesday night and then will square off on the road against Vanderbilt on March 4 to close out the regular season.\n-", "external_links": ["https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/szitglxogjahka5fqqtf)", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/lpwoazk3ogbd9c2dxfvc)", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/lpwoazk3ogbd9c2dxfvc", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/szitglxogjahka5fqqtf"], "published": "2017-02-22T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:49:57.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
