Stephen Lawrence was knifed to death in Eltham in 1993 (PA) \nThe judge Recorder Paul Clements described him as being at a very high level in the plot, with others reporting to him. \nHe added: \"Perhaps one of the problems with you is that, for various reasons, you have heard too much negativity about you and begun to believe the negative publicity about you. \n\"Perhaps it's time to walk away from that aspect of your personality and whatever or whoever it is controlling those parts.\" \nHe described the plot as a pre-planned and concerted effort to move substantial amounts of cannabis \"that in any estimation would have kept the people of the Newcastle area in spliffs for many a long day\". \nThe two-year conspiracy involved dozens of 600-mile (965km) round trips from London to the South Shields area, driving drugs up and bringing cash back. \nAcourt's co-defendants were also handed substantial jail terms for their various roles. \nThe judge added: \"Just look at you all - all six of you - all thoroughly ashamed of yourselves, all having ruined your lives by your involvement in this.\" Read more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:55:13.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
