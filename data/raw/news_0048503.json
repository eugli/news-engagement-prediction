It’s Rs 396 on February 17, 2017; and market capitalisation is at Rs 3,000 crore. \n\nThe name of this galloping smallcap pharma stock is Caplin Point Laboratories . The stock has surged some 11,800 per cent in nine years, driven mainly by robust fundamentals. \n\nImagine you had bought this stock in 2008! An investment of Rs 10,000 could become over Rs 3 crore this February. \n\nThe best part is, Caplin Point’s journey so far has been driven by inherent strength of the stock. The return on net worth of the stock has risen from 5.22 per cent in 2008 to 57.07 per cent in 2016. All through this period, the company has seen a steady increase in return on networth on a year-on-year basis. \n\nThe company’s bottom line has risen at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 50 per cent in last nine years. Net profit has surged from Rs 1.04 crore in 2007-08 to Rs 46.32 crore in 2015-16. \n\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the company reported a net profit of Rs 17.70 crore, up 10.76 per cent from Rs 15.98 crore reported for the corresponding quarter last year. Gross sales have increased 16.09 per cent year-on-year to Rs 87.67 crore for the quarter under review. \n\nIncorporated in 1990, the company manufactures a range of ointments, creams and other external applications. Caplin Point got listed on the bourses in 1994 and it used the IPO proceeds for setting up of a manufacturing facility at Puducherry and then further expanded the production capacity. \n\nOver the years, the company penetrated Latin America with a focus on the semi-regulated pharmaceutical markets of Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador, among others. \n\nToday, Caplin Point is one of the leading Indian pharma companies in the semi-regulated Latin American markets. \n\nIn the annual report for 2015-16, the company said, “We expect to generate 20 to 25 per cent compounded annual revenue growth over the next few years. Next three years are possibly going to be more exciting as we evolve from being a retail product marketing-cum-outsourcing company present in the semi-regulated Latin American markets into a formulations manufacturing company addressing the largest pharmaceutical market in the world , i.e. the US.” \n\nAs of last available data, the promoters held around 69.09 per cent stake in the company. \n\nOn further movement of Caplin Point Laboratories stock, Jay Prakash Gupta, Director and CEO, MDirect, said, “With robust presence of the company in Latin American markets, the stock will continue to outperform the broader markets in coming years.” \n\nKishor Ostwal, CMD, CNI Research said, “Caplin Point Labs is looking fairly priced right now.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T17:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:44:02.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
