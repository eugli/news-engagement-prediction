That means the former Sixth Man of the Year winner will be enjoying the green light of Houston coach Mike D’Antoni in what’s left of an already career-high scoring season (27.7 points per 36 minutes for the 30-year-old Williams). \nIt means James Harden will have more help in the Rockets backcourt and presumably more chances to grab some bench. And it gives D’Antoni so much firepower in reserve that the NBA might want to think about instituting a Seventh Man of the Year award: The #Rockets now have the two highest scorers off the bench in the #NBA .Lou Williams: 18.6 ppg — Conrad Garcia (@ConradBuckets) February 22, 2017 \nFor the Lakers, Brewer’s salary and contract term (through 2017-18) are about a wash with Williams, but the first-round pick – even late in that round – is the type of asset Johnson and his new staff in L.A. are prioritizing. Rockets still have two 2nd rd. picks in June: Portland and Denver. Both picks are projected to be in the 40's. — Bobby Marks (@BobbyMarks42) February 22, 2017 \nAnd as usually happens with deals made while there’s still time on the clock before the annual trade deadline, a number of teams that might have coveted the Rockets’ or Lakers’ return have moved quickly to Plans B, C: I wouldn't be surprised to see teams that missed on Lou Williams (NOLA, WAS, CLE, etc.) shift their focus to Darren Collison. He can be had. — Alex Kennedy (@AlexKennedyNBA) February 22, 2017 \nCopyright © 2017 NBA Media Ventures, LLC. All rights reserved.
