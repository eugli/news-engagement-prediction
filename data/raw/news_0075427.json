'Moonlight,' you guys won Best Picture. This is not a joke,\" producer Jordan Horowitz said.\nHost Jimmy Kimmel quickly stepped into the middle of the confusion, and compared it to Steve Harvey's gaffe in awarding the Miss Universe title to the wrong contestant in 2015.\n\"Personally, I blame Steve Harvey for this,\" Kimmel said.\nBut it was presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway who announced the wrong winner. Beatty opened the envelope, looked to co-presenter Dunaway, then appeared to struggle with the announcement.\n\"And the Academy Award…\" he said, pausing to glance at the envelope. \"…For Best Picture…\"\nDunaway urged him on momentarily, then accepted the envelope and read: \"La La Land.\"\nA stage hand delivered the news while producer Marc Platt was making the first speech for \"La La Land.\" Producer Fred Berger reluctantly stepped up to the mic next, despite being told already that he had not won, and started thanking his loved ones.\nThen Horowitz stepped in and announced the mistake – at which point Berger also acknowledged: \"We lost, by the way, but, you know.\"\nHorowitz held up the actually winning card, showing that \"Moonlight\" had won.\n\"I'm going to be really proud to hand this to my friends from 'Moonlight,'\" Horowitz told Kimmel, after Kimmel suggested he keep the trophy anyway.\nIt was awkward, and Beatty ultimately threw himself on the grenade, taking full responsibility. \"I opened the envelope and it said, Emma Stone, 'La La Land.' That's why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn't trying to be funny.
