He stepped down when he was still playing good footy and we’d just won a premiership. So they’re the things we look for at the club. \n“I think to elevate three vice captains — Dane Rampe, Dan Han, Luke Parker — just gives our leadership model a restructure and I think can only be positive for the football club.” Kieren Jack will remain in the Swans’ leadership group.

If I’m a small down there at their feet I should get a fair few opportunities,” Jack said. \nJLT Community Series - Don’t miss your Footy team’s youngsters on show!
