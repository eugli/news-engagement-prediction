Auto update 8:17AM What is Article 127? How is it different to Article 50? \nT riggering Article 50 (of the Treaty of Lisbon) gives any EU member the right to quit, and outlines the procedure for doing so. \nArticle 127 of the EEA Agreement is the process by which a country could leave the EEA. \nSenior lawyers have said they believe Article 50 does not provide for leaving the EEA, which extends the single market's tariff-free trade in goods to countries like Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. \nThe single market is a trade agreement that allows different countries within the EU to trade across borders as easily as they can within their own country, with no extra tariffs or negotiations. \nHowever, the Government has said that as the UK is party to the EEA Agreement only in its capacity as a member of the EU, which would mean that once we leave the EU, the UK would automatically cease to be a member of the EEA. 8:02AM PM call on EU leaders to spend more money on defence \nT heresa May will call on EU leaders to spend more money on defence during a summit in Malta today [FRI], in the wake of support she secured from Donald Trump following his call for other countries to pay more. \nThe Prime Minister will reiterate the American President's promise to continue to support NATO after he raised doubts about his stance on the alliance during the election campaign.

Once the UK leaves the EU, the EEA agreement will automatically cease to apply to the UK.” What does Article 127 actually say? \nEach Contracting Party may withdraw from this Agreement provided it gives at least twelve months' notice in writing to the other Contracting Parties. \nImmediately after the notification of the intended withdrawal, the other Contracting Parties shall convene a diplomatic conference in order to envisage the necessary modifications to bring to the Agreement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:20:54.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
