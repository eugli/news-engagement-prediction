However, others aren’t quite allowing Simon & Schuster to get away with doing the bare minimum . \nWhen Simon & Schuster, under its imprint Threshold Books, gave Yiannopoulos a reported $250k book deal in December, critics argued that it offered him a platform for hate speech. Simon & Schuster tried to assure authors that wouldn’t be the case. Regardless, best-selling author Roxane Gay felt like she could no longer publish an upcoming book with TED Books, another imprint of Simon & Schuster. \nHow to Be Heard wasn’t set to be released until 2018, but she asked her agent to pull her book in protest of Yiannopoulos’ controversial book deal, which she felt he never should’ve gotten. While she believes that Yiannopoulos has the right to vocalize his beliefs—no matter how offensive she finds them—she could no longer do business with a publisher who allowed him to publish them. \nNow that Simon & Schuster has dropped Yiannopoulos, however, Gay isn’t interested in bringing her book back to the publisher. For one, she noted how Simon & Schuster moved Yiannopoulos’ book back to directly compete with one of her other books after she pulled How to Be Heard . Did I mention that Simon & Schuster moved the release date of Dangerous to June 13, the day Hunger is coming out? Oh wait — roxane gay (@rgay) February 21, 2017 When they pulled that move, I took note and said nothing because I was not threatened or pressed. — roxane gay (@rgay) February 21, 2017 But it was not a coincidence. It was malicious. And that's how I will forever think of Simon & Schuster. — roxane gay (@rgay) February 21, 2017 But that isn’t the only reason she doesn’t want to go back to Simon & Schuster. She elaborated in a Tumblr post that despite Yiannopoulos’ long history of harmful comments toward women and people of color, Simon & Schuster only cut Yiannopoulos after he appeared to support pedophilia —i.e, once he was no longer viable for business . They did not finally “do the right thing” and now we know where their threshold, pun intended, lies. They were fine with his racist and xenophobic and sexist ideologies. They were fine with his transphobia, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. They were fine with how he encourages his followers to harass women and people of color and transgender people online. Let me assure you, as someone who endured a bit of that harassment, it is breathtaking in its scope, intensity, and cruelty but hey, we must protect the freedom of speech. Certainly, Simon & Schuster was not alone in what they were willing to tolerate. A great many people were perfectly comfortable with the targets of Milo’s hateful attention until that attention hit too close to home. \nOthers online agree, arguing that when women and people of color point out being attacked, they're dismissed.
