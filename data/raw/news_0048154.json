They then decided to tape the continuous stream of handshakes and put it up on Facebook. \nAccording to Gray, the dynamic between teacher and student has changed in education. Teachers have to try, “different things to get [students] excited and feel welcome and build those relationships.” \nHer students’ excitement has been long-lasting. They’ve continued their special handshakes since recording this video. \n**** \nFor more stories like this, LIKE Humankind on Facebook .
