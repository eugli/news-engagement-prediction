Source: Tweet \nCabinet minister Christopher Pyne has branded Tony Abbott's suggestion the federal government curtail immigration as \"catastrophic\". \nMr Pyne noted the former prime minister was now a backbencher, although he was free to state his views. \n\"The worst thing we could do is get distracted,\" he told Nine Network on Friday. \nMr Abbott on Thursday said the Turnbull government risked a \"drift to defeat\" at the next election if it failed to lift its performance. \n\"Our challenge is to be worth voting for,\" Mr Abbott said. \n\"Our politics can't be just a contest of toxic egos or someone's vanity project.\" \nHis plan for a coalition victory includes scaling back immigration to help take the pressure off house prices, scrapping the Human Rights Commission, ending subsidies for renewable energy and stopping all new spending. \nMr Pyne rejected some of those suggestions. \n\"We won't be going down the track of putting a freeze on immigration, for example, which Tony wants to do because it would be catastrophic,\" he said. \n\"We won't be slashing spending - Tony Abbott tried that in the 2014 budget during his leadership but of course a whole lot of zombie legislation sat in the Senate unable to be passed.\" \nMr Pyne said the government was getting on with the job and Australians were \"pretty happy\" with Malcolm Turnbull's leadership. \nOne of the last polls taken when Mr Abbott was still prime minister pegged his preferred leader rating at 30 per cent against Opposition Leader Bill Shorten's 48 per cent. \n\"So we are on the right track with Malcolm Turnbull and with the government's policies,\" Mr Pyne said. \nLabor frontbencher Anthony Albanese said the government was a shambles and suffering from a policy vacuum. \n\"The government doesn't have an agenda,\" he told Nine. \n\"Tony Abbott's solution is to say 'take what I did in the 2014 budget and go more extreme, go harder'. \n\"Tony Abbott is delusional and the government is dysfunctional,\" he said. \nIn London, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the Liberal party welcomed policy suggestions from ministers and backbenchers. \nBut she rejected Mr Abbott's \"drift to defeat\" view. \n\"I don't accept that characterisation at all,\" she told reporters.
