Slot to Florida State Links (Photo: Chris Nee, 247Sports) \nFlorida State defensive tackles/associate head coach Odell Haggins is the 247Sports Recruiter of the Year in the ACC after helping the Seminoles land the nation's sixth-ranked recruiting class. \nClick here for the full ACC rankings. \nHaggins served as the primary recruiter for five of Florida State's signees, including five-star defensive tackle Marvin Wilson and five-star running back Khalan Laborn . He also helped the Seminoles land four-star defensive tackle Ja'len Parks , four-star wide receiver D.J. Matthews and three-star defensive tackle Cory Durden . \nIn landing Wilson from Houston on National Signing Day, Haggins may have scored the biggest recruiting win of the 2017 cycle. Wilson, the nation's No. 6 overall player, is the jewel of Florida State's defensive haul. \nIt should be noted Haggins owned Newberry High School in Florida, where he landed both Parks and Durden, who will join Wilson at defensive tackle. \nHaggins is the longest-tenured coach at Florida State, joining the staff in 1994. He's been the Seminoles defensive line coach since 1996. Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T19:44:35.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
