We consider other products that might not get their 'likes' Lucy Rahim 23 February 2017 • 7:26pm \nB reakfast tables nationwide have been rattled today with the news that marmalade, that Great British stalwart, is now a preserve for the elderly . The ubiquitous spread, made with boiled oranges and sugar , has been a feature of early-morning meals for over 100 years, but is now being shunned by the younger generation. \nNew data reveals that six out of 10 marmalade-buyers are over 65, with only one in 100 shoppers under the age of 28. The study claims that, unlike the older generation of \"shred-heads\", millennials, who have perhaps been brought up on fruity fromage frais and chocolate spread, cannot abide the bits of peel found in a traditional chunky marmalade. \nSo what other classic British foodstuffs are unlikely to be on a millennial's hot list? 1) Tapioca pudding Tapioca was frequently featured in school meals from the 1950s-70s \nT aken from the cassava plant, tapioca is a starch usually sold in Britain in the form of chewy pearls. It rose to fame (or infamy) in British schools throughout the 20th century, in the form of a musty, soggy pudding boiled with milk, affectionately referred to as frogspawn. Its absence from school dinners and home kitchens (presumably because parents are still scarred by the memory) means that those under the age of 30 are unlikely to have tried it, let alone posted a shot of it on Instagram. Those tempted can find tinned tapioca pudding on the shelves in supermarkets. 2) Ovaltine The quintessential malty drink for many a bedtime Credit: ovaltine.co.uk \nA re you an Ovaltiney? If you're in your 20s, it's perhaps unlikely. Created by Swiss chemist Dr Wander in 1904, Ovaltine is a powdered drink made of malt extract, barley, milk powder, cocoa and vitamins and minerals. Although initially envisaged as a nutritious, energy-giving supplement (it was the official drink of the 1948 Olympics and a favourite among skiers), Ovaltine has gained a reputation as a soothing, night-time drink (delivering the taste of melted Maltesers in a mug) favoured by the elderly. Sadly, the British factory closed down in the early noughties . 3) Oxtail soup Water with added vertebra \nT raditional oxtail soup is literally made with the vertebra from the ox (the epitome of nose-to-tail eating). Heinz places its version of oxtail soup in its classics range, those being \"the soups we all grew up with\" - meaning that no one born in the 90s has ever heard of it. It's a classic favourite for Baxters, too, though you'll only find a scant 1 per cent of oxtail meat in either of these products. Sadly, oxtail has gone the same way as liver and tongue when it comes to mainstream popularity, but you'll find it in butcher's shops and we'd entreat you to revive the ingredient by taking inspiration from Diana Henry's brilliant braise with star anise and spring onions . 4) Kippers Kippers were a standard breakfast item in Victorian and Edwardian households. Clearly the last time young people ate them was 1945, when this picture was taken.

For the uninitiated, a kipper is a whole herring that has been butterflied, gutted and smoked, traditionally eaten at breakfast (and most often cooked, or 'jugged', by pouring boiling water over it in a jug). Given its persistent, pungent aroma, it's perhaps not surprising that the kipper is no longer a favourite fish, but perhaps trying it in a cheese toastie will convince under-30s otherwise.

Has it ever come near a banana or strawberry? All are valid questions when encountering Angel Delight, the powdered dessert that rose to fame in the 1960s, when convenience foods were coming into fashion. The ingredients list is as far from clean-eating as it is possible to be, making this a product likely only to be found lingering in the pantries of those over a certain age. 6) Smash Why have the real thing when you can get it in a jar? \nA nother powdered wonder, Smash rose to fame in the 1970s with an award-winning advert featuring martians that laughed at the poor humans who made mash with actual potatoes, rather than granules. Unlikely to have been eaten by anyone who knows the lyrics to a Justin Bieber song. 7) Kendal mint cake A healthy snack for active folk \nB ack in the days when chocolate and copious amounts of sugar were considered good energy boosters, Kendal mint cake was considered a nourishing pick-me-up for walkers and backpackers, and was taken on a trans-Arctic expedition in 1913. Though a renaissance has been attempted at the Gilbert Scott restaurant in London, you can purchase this block of menthol and glucose largely at tourist gift shops in Cumbria. It's not exactly a bliss ball , is it? 8) Sandwich spread Who could resist the charms of this vinegary delight? \nO nce upon a time, avocado was not what Brits chose to slather on their bread when pushed for time. They turned instead to sandwich spread; a tangy gloop featuring diced cabbage, carrots and gherkins. A cult item for the over-60s perhaps, but it's hard to imagine anyone under 30 topping their sourdough with such a spread. 9) Suet pudding Suet pudding is classic British fare \nA Victorian staple, suet pudding is British stodge at its finest. A filling of meat, onions and vegetables (or jam and fruit, in the sweet version) was surrounded by a thick case made of shredded beef suet (that's fat, for anyone born post 1989), flour and water, that was boiled in muslin for several hours. We entreat you to try Stephen Harris' lamb version, which is light, laced with sweet roasted-onion purée, and bound to win over eaters of any age - out in the Daily Telegraph on Saturday. 10) Devilled kidneys Some offal with your flat white? Credit: Heathcliff O'Malley \nP ity the poor millennial who comes across this Edwardian delicacy thinking that they're an exciting variety of mushroom. They are in fact a lamb's little internal organs, fried in copious amounts of butter, cayenne and mustard and dolloped on toast. On second thoughts, whack them on a hipster brunch menu chalked up on a blackboard and we reckon they'd come running.
