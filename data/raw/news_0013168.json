The 2016 Annual Report on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict in Afghanistan, released on Monday, documents an overall three per cent rise in civilian casualties — both deaths and injuries — from the previous year. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) supposes the sharp rise in children’s deaths is because of a 66% spike in casualties from left-over or discarded munitions. \nReuters Also, the number of children injured rose by about 23 per cent. Overall it was the highest number of casualties among children ever recorded in a single year by UNAMA. The report said, “Conflict-related violence exacted a heavy toll on Afghanistan in 2016, with an overall deterioration in civilian protection and the highest-total civilian casualties recorded since 2009, when UNAMA began systematic documentation of civilian casualties.” And the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto, said, “This appalling conflict destroys lives and tears communities apart in every corner of Afghanistan. \nReuters \"Real protection of civilians requires commitment and demonstrated concrete actions to protect civilians from harm and for parties to the conflict to ensure accountability for indiscriminate and deliberate acts of civilian harm.\" Don't Miss ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T14:11:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
