Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nTwo young cousins have been left languishing helplessly in hospital beds as five members of their family was hit with the shigellosis bug sweeping Britain. \nSixteen-month-old James Logan was rushed to hospital in an ambulance twice last week after suffering frightening 'seizures' from the sickness thought to have been caught at a playcentre. \n\"With the first time, I saw him on the floor, face down and I could hear him making a very strange noise,' his mum Charlotte Cullum, 24, told The Mirror. \n\"His arms and his legs were all shaking. I went over and picked him up and he was all floppy. He was then out cold for 40 minutes after we got him to hospital.

It was awful.\" \nBut James' cousin Ruby, 17 months old, is still in hospital today after her parents and grandmother also caught the vomiting bug. \nLast week 90 people - mainly school pupils and their family members - in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, were displaying symptoms from the bug. \nThe NHS say it is caused by poor hygiene but can then be spread in areas such as door knobs in schools or workplaces. \nThere have been unconfirmed reports of cases elsewhere in the country from Preston, Lancashire and Cornwall. James was rushed to hospital twice (Photo: Mirror Online) \nLittle James suffered diarrhea and sickness on Monday and Tuesday, triggering a seizure and an ambulance trip to the hospital. \nIt was thought to be a random virus but James suffered another fit on Wednesday morning and was rushed back to Basildon Hospital in Essex. \nHe was kept there for 36 hours under observation and blood tests where his mother said he was diagnosed with shigellosis. \nBut the bug then hit his 17-month-old cousin Ruby after she was looked after at James' house early last week. Ruby has been hospitalised over the bug outbreak (Photo: Mirror Online) \nRuby then passed the bug on to her parents. \nCharlotte, of Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, said her own mother had also fallen ill to the bug. \n\"These kids are so weak,\" she said. \n\"They can't even stand up properly and look so dopey in the face. But we just have to wait it out and flush it through their system. \n\"Basildon Hospital have been absolutely brilliant.\" Ruby in hospital (Photo: Mirror Online) \nBasildon Hospital could not comment on numbers of people hit by the bug in the region. \nRuby's mum, Laura Cullum, 28, was visiting hospital today where she was looking after her daughter. \n\"It's been awful,\" she said. \n\"My daughter is normally the life and soul of our lives and she has been literally on a bed since Wedsneday. \n\"She hasn't eaten anything since Tuesday. She is constantly sick.\" \nParents are being warned to be vigilant after the outbreak of the nasty vomiting and diarrhoea bug that has forced some schools to send their pupils home.
