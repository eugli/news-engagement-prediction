Now, it’s Paul Wesley who’s making us tear up. \nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Wesley confessed that he cried when he first read the finale script, and he even sent a teary-eyed selfie to the creators of the show. “I wanted them to see that Paul Wesley could actually formulate tears in his personal life and not just on screen,” the actor said. \nUnfortunately for us, that selfie is private and will probably never surface to the public. But the thought of Wesley crying in real life is enough for us. \n“It’s this very interesting melancholy,” he explained of saying goodbye to his character, Stefan Salvatore. \n“I did Stefan’s final scene with Elena [Dobrev]. It was strangely emotional for me. You’re saying goodbye to this time and this moment. The two of us are never going to be playing these characters ever again, and these were really important characters in television for eight years. That’s emotional.” \nAs for his thoughts on how the show concludes? \n“I thought how it ended was powerful.” \n“The Vampire Diaries” series finale airs March 10 on The CW .
