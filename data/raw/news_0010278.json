According to the Times, Trump demanded that his chief of staff Reince Priebus to come up with a fundamental approach to executive orders.\nPriebus told Trump and Bannon that the administration needs to revamp its policy and communications after the recent leaks about the orders coming out. Priebus created a 10-point checklist for the release of any new initiatives that needs a signoff from the White House communications department, The Times reported.\nTrump restructured the White House National Security Council at the end of January, adding Bannon to the principals committee, which includes the secretaries of state and defense. At the same time, Trump said his director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would attend \"where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.\"\nBannon served in the Navy before attending Harvard Business School, working at Goldman Sachs, starting his own media-focused boutique investment banking firm and later heading the ultraconservative outlet Breitbart News, which has been condemned for featuring racist, sexist and anti-Semitic content.\n\"He is a former naval officer. He's got a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer told ABC's \"This Week\" last month.\nSpicer said \"having the chief strategist for the president in those meetings who has a significant military background to help make -- guide what the president's final analysis is going to be is crucial.\"\nBut to Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, the NSC \"sadly has some really questionable people on it,\" he told NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" citing Bannon among them.\nAnd Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called Bannon's appointment \"a radical departure from any National Security Council in history.\"\nHe had told \"Face the Nation\" on CBS: \"The role of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has been diminished, I understand, with this reorganization. One person who is indispensable would be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in my view. So, it's of concern, this `reorganization.\"'\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \nClick for more from The New York Times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T10:58:16.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
