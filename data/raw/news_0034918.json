Second request was to conduct the secret ballot vote which again he did not agree to,\" Pannerselvam said. \n\nExpressing sympathies to DMK MLAs who were forcibly evicted from the Assembly, the former CM said, \"It is against democracy and the resolution was passed after they were evicted from the Assembly.\" \n\nOn the appointment of AIADMK General Secretary V K Sasikala 's family members to top party posts, Pannerselvam said \"if Jayalalihaa was alive, she would have continued to ensure that they did not have any access to the party.\" \n\n\"Today the fight is between the followers of Amma and Sasikala. The team led by Amma (Jayalalithaa) will win.... definitely,\" he added. \n\nSitting MLA Semmalai, who was appointed as the party whip by the O Panneerselvam camp said, \"The battle is over and the war has just begun.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T14:19:48.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
