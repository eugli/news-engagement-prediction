Read the policy . (CNN) To buy a camel in Abu Dhabi, the place to go is Ikea. Not because the Swedish furniture giant is now retailing self-assembly ships of the desert -- although it probably would if it could. It's just that Abu Dhabi's last traditional camel market, a daily bustle of haggling, hooves, handshakes and humps, sits right next to an Ikea store decked in familiar blue and yellow. The camel souk is one of the highlights of a day trip to Abu Dhabi's second city Al Ain, a lush, laid back and historic escape from the emirate's coastal capital. It takes about two hours to drive the straight-line highways from downtown Abu Dhabi through the desert to Al Ain ( experimental tech could one day reduce that to eight minutes). Read More It's a journey deeper into desert, on the border with Oman, but one that leads to some of the best cultural attractions in a region more usually known for big buildings and big spending. Al Ain Oasis Chief among those attractions is the Al Ain Oasis. Walking beneath the fruited date palms of this green space in the heart of the city, listening to the babbling of a nearby stream, it's easy to forget you're in a place that's mostly desert. This tranquil forest of tall trees and quiet walled lanes interspersed by a maze of waterways is all the more remarkable because, a few years ago, it almost vanished. As Al Ain grew in the 1980s and 90s, the oasis was in danger of being swallowed up by development. Instead, planners pushed back, expanding the greenery out into the city. The Al Ain Oasis is now a protected UNESCO site. The oasis's delicate eco-system, farmed using methods thousands of years old, is now protected as a UNESCO heritage site, and helps give Al Ain its Garden City nickname. A visitor center opened here in 2016 and cycles can be hired to explore, but for anyone tired of Abu Dhabi's relentless heat, it's more pleasant to stroll in the cool palm frond shadows. Occasionally, visitors might come across one of the irrigation channels, known as falaj, springing into life as they direct water from nearby cisterns to thirsty date groves. \"I can just stare at these trees for hours,\" says Usman Mustafa, an engineer on a break from working in Dubai. \"This place is like a beautiful sanctuary.\" Al Ain Oasis , Al Ain, Abu Dhabi; +971 3 712 8523 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:32:46.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
