Photo: supplied \nOne of those who likely wasn’t complaining was Patrick Johnson, of bespoke tailor P. Johnson Tailors, and his interior designer wife Tamsin Johnson, who scored $1,755,000 for their Darling Point apartment. \nSelling agent Gavin Rubinstein had listed the whole-floor spread this month with an initial guide of between $1.3 million and $1.4 million. The reserve was lifted to $1.5 million shortly before the auction, but still sold for $255,000 more than that. \nThe couple paid $1,065,000 for the apartment in 2012, but had redesigned it since then. \nTailor Patrick Johnson and his interior designer wife Tamsin are selling their Darling Point apartment. Photo: Supplied \nThe Johnsons are bound for Tamarama, where they have paid $3.85 million for the family home of Philip Green , until recently the Australian High Commissioner in Singapore. \nAnother interior designer to cash in on the current market conditions on the night was Juliet Black, wife of radiologist James Black. \nBlack’s recently renovated project on Bellevue Hill’s Ginahgulla Road received offers late last year of $6.7 million and $6.8 million, but instead she opted to put it under the hammer this week. It sold for about $7 million, again through Rubinstein. \nThis Bellevue Hill home was bought for $5 million, renovated last year and sold on Thursday for about $7 million.
