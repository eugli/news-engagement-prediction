Mishra said the conductor and driver of the DTC low-floor green bus also abused him verbally and threatened with dire consequences. \nR Sathiyasundaram, additional deputy commissioner of police (east), said that a case of assault and threatening was registered against the bus conductor and driver at the Ghazipur police station.

The complainant gave us a video that had the registration number of the bus. We served them a notice,” said Sathiyasundaram. \nThe film maker in his complaint told police that on Wednesday around 7.35 pm, he was walking back home in Patparganj from his studio in Kaushambi, Ghaziabad. As he reached the traffic signal at the Patparganj crossing, a DTC low floor non-AC bus stopped at the traffic signal. \n“The bus conductors stepped out the vehicle and began relieving himself between the footpath and the road. I taunted him, saying why he was ruining the Clean India efforts of our Prime Minister by urinating at a public place. The conductor began verbally abusing me while the bus started moving,” said Mishra. \nAs Mishra took out his mobile phone and started shooting a video of the bus, the bus driver stopped the vehicle. Suddenly, the conductor came out and rained punches on Mishra. The driver and his associate too joined the conductor, he said. \n“When I tried to flee, the three threatened to crush me under the wheels of the bus. They left when I called the police control room,” he added. Mishra was taken to Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital. An FIR was later registered on his complaint.
