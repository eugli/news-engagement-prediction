So, I wanted to figure out a way to bring the two together. I went from volunteering to running the organization and helping to build it up. We started out with four to six science clubs. We now have 19 running all across the Greater Toronto Area.\nEugenia Duodu, centre, leading a group of students through her Vision of Science program. (CBC)\nI grew up in a Toronto Community Housing community and I found that I enjoyed science. I loved science. I was engaged in science and I had teachers who really motivated me and had different learning styles that really inspired me. So as I was journeying and navigating through science I realized I was becoming lonelier and lonelier in my field in terms of my life experience, being from housing and being a Black woman.\nA group of boys working on a project set up by the Visions of Science program. (CBC)\nIt seems like there were so many negative experiences as it related to science, but as I was getting more into the field I was being exposed to so many different opportunities, feeling super empowered, feeling like, 'Wow I can do this or I can do that.' So, I was like I really wish some of my friends had this opportunity as well to experience science in a different way and to just see the possibility and not only with science, but all of STEM- science, technology, engineering and math.\nWhat do you hope people take away from the 150 photos of women featured in HERstory in Black?\nEugenia Duodu: I want people to look at that photo and just feel empowered to do anything. I feel like that photo represents legacy in terms of what black women can achieve. I want people to look at that photo and be like I can do this, whatever this looks like for them. I want them to feel very encouraged and empowered to do whatever they need to do to the fullest or maybe beyond what they thought that they could do because I think that's what that photo represents. It represents women who are going above and beyond what the status quo was for them.\nEugenia Duobu is among 150 black women from the GTA featured in a digital photo series called HERstory in Black.
