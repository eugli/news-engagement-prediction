Zoë Kravitz showed off an effortlessly polished beauty look with a pre-Grammys snap featuring her icy baby braids tucked into her collar to mimic a chop, an equally cool pink pout, and a peace sign. Meanwhile, musician SZA went full iron maiden, swapping her trademark curls for blown out Rapunzel lengths finished with bangs, subtle metallic touches, and a grin. Statement eyes found fans in more than a few models: Hari Nef took a break at the Berlin Zoo to show off a bedazzled gaze and matte red lips, Georgia Fowler blinked from behind a set of doll-like lashes, and Lenny Kravitz gave a lesson in taking a Valentine’s Day bath like a rock legend. And always the fitness fan, Emma Roberts rounded out a trip to New York with a BFF-friendly Pilates session, reminding followers that strong beauty moments are best worn by strong women.
