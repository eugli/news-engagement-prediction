As previously reported , the Obama-era guidance allowed transgender students to use school bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities, which advocates argued was essential in helping to protect trans students from bullying and discrimination. Without it, the decision on whether or not to allow transgender students to use their restrooms and locker rooms of choice will be given back to the states and school districts, which will now be responsible for interpreting federal anti-discrimination laws.\n In response to these protections being rescinded, people were quick to voice their outrage, including quite a few celebrities who've made it clear that they're a part of #TheResistance. Here are just some who have voiced their opposition to the roll backs so far.\nWe need to protect trans youth and stand up against this cruelty that hurts our kids.

What jobs does that create? How is that keeping the US safe? #Resist\n— billy eichner (@billyeichner) February 23, 2017\nI am obviously disappointed in the @POTUS decision to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide. #sisterlove\n— jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) February 22, 2017\nwe must #ProtectTransKids . this administration is attacking disenfranchised communities one by one. we must stand together for what's right. https://t.co/zbCIoMZKRi\n— Tyler Oakley (@tyleroakley) February 23, 2017\nJust seeing the news about removing laws protecting trans people.
