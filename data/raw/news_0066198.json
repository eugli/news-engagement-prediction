(Picture: Benjamin Mayo / 9to5Mac<br />) \nIt would use an infrared beam to sense the depth and position of nearby objects – and use that information in images. \nMultiple reports from respected analysts and industry sources have suggested this year’s iPhone 8 – expected in September, as is traditional from Apple – will be a near-complete overhaul. Here's what to expect from iPhone 8 \nRespected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo – who has a long track record of accurate predictions of upcoming iPhone models – said that Apple is going to shake things up with a new ‘curved’ look in 2017. \nThe prediction has been echoed with rumours from within Apple’s supply chain. \nSpeaking to Nikkei Asian review earlier this year, source predicted that the next phone would be ‘equipped with a screen bent on the two sides’. \nAs well as a larger screen dominating the front of the device, Apple may well ditch the Home button entirely – echoing rival Google, whose Pixel phone has no physical buttons on the front. \nManufacturing documents from Apple’s Asian supply chain suggest it’ll have a new ‘invisible’ home button, according to leaked documents seen by Apple Insider. \nCiting sources in Apple’s supply chain, Japanese business publication NIkkei said the new phone will come in three models – and all will have glass backs. \nAll three phones will have glass backs supplied by Biel Crystal Manufactory and Lens Technology in China. \n‘Apple has tentatively decided that all the 5.5-inch, 5-inch and 4.7-inch models will have glass backs, departing from metal casings adopted by current iPhones, and Biel and Lens are likely to be providing all the glass backs for the new iPhones next year,’ the source said. \nOther smartphone brands such as Samsung already offer wireless charging – and Apple uses it in Apple Watch – so analysts believe the new iPhone will charge wirelessly. \nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities predicted wireless charging in at least one of the models on sale this year. \nInstead of plugging phones into a cable, users will sit them on a dedicated charging pad to power them up. \nNext year’s crop of iPhones could contain a mysterious high-powered new model – codenamed ‘Ferrari’ – according to leaked documents from Chinese manufacturers. \nApple Insider says that the leaked document hints at three handsets – titled D20, D21 and D22 – and that D20 and D21 will be the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. \nThe third handset will be, ‘A completely redesigned high-end variant,’ according to the site.
