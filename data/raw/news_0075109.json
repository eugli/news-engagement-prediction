Ranieri guided Leicester to a stunning Premier League title last season but was dismissed on Feb. 23 after a dismal defence of the trophy, which sees them in the relegation zone ahead of Monday's clash against Klopp's side. The Times' Matt Hughes reported some senior Foxes players had met with the board to discuss Ranieri's position, and it was suggested they were partly to blame for the Italian's dismissal. Per David Maddock of the Mirror , Reds' manager Klopp said: \nPlayers are not more powerful. We were much more powerful in the past. It depends always on the board. If there is a direct way to the board—if the owners sit with the players and ask 'how are you?' and they say 'not too good' and it is 'why?'—'because of the manager'.It is not about how powerful. The players need to be powerful but not in sacking managers. They never did it. It’s not like the Leicester players did it or something. It is if someone asked they gave an answer. More to follow.
