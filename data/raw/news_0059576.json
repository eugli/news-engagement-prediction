'You're getting tired hey, my nan,' Mr Stoneman said. He said she was still doing well with 'plenty more years to come'. 'You're still doing fine, aye nanny. It's just time for her to get off Facebook and just chill. Just chill in her chair. There's still gonna be a lot of support out here, with my sister and mum and I'm still gonna be here for her.' 'It's just time for her to get off Facebook and just chill. Just chill in her chair,' Mr Stoneman said Jarryd Stoneman and his nanny Katie Thomas went viral in March last year when he asked her to dance â€“ even though she can't walk He said people assumed he was documenting their friendship for attention, and he would hate for that to affect his nanny. 'There's a lot of hate on Facebook, and I'd hate for any of that to come to our page. People try to say I use her for attention. That was never the case. It was just to promote elderly awareness and share our bond,' Mr Stoneman said. 'There's always a time where you just want to have some privacy, and I feel like that's nan's time. He thanked everybody for joining their journey and said he would continue to inform his audience how she is 'going strong'. 'For now, it's goodbye,' he said after turning his cap backwards and giving his nanny a kiss on the cheek. Mr Stoneman has shared his friendship with his grandmother on Facebook over the last year since posting the viral video of their dance to Lukas Graham's song 7 Years. The original video has been viewed more than 90,000 and shared by more than 50,000 other Facebook users. Mr Stoneman had asked his grandmother to dance, to which she replied 'yes' and nodded. The nanny and grandson have documented their friendship together on Facebook 'Asked nanny for a dance, she can't remember much but she still knows how to move', he wrote alongside the video. The pair started the dance slowly, as Mr Stoneman's grandmother is a little unsteady on her feet without her walking frame. But as Mr Stoneman and his grandmother circled the room they appeared overwhelmed with joy. At one point Mr Stoneman got on his knees, and they smiled at each other before embracing. 'She can't walk but she can dance,' he said. 'Still got it hey nanny.' After the dance, Mr Stoneman planted a kiss on her head and asked if they should have breakfast together. She nodded and he retrieved her walking frame. Family and friends didn't hesitate to express how emotive the video was for them. Brooke Hogan wrote: 'Jarryd this is beautiful.
