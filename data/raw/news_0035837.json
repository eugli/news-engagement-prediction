The gathering of Catholic clergy and activists comes as the world grapples with the impact of President Donald Trump's attempts to change US immigration policy. The pontiff said: 'Christian terrorism does not exist, Jewish terrorism does not exist, and Muslim terrorism does not exist.' Pope Francis insisted in the letter to the conference in Modesto that there are 'violent individuals in all peoples and religions'. And he said 'intolerant generalisations' would only make these people stronger because because they feed on hate and xenophobia. 'Do not classify others in order to see who is a neighbor and who is not,' the pope said. 'You can become neighbor to whomever you meet in need, and you will do so if you have compassion in your heart.' Despite insisting he was talking about 'anyone in particular', his speech is likely to be interpreted as a critique of President Trump's immigration policy. The gathering comes as the world grapples with the impact of President Trump's attempts to change immigration policy.

He said: 'I ask all of you, people of all backgrounds including native people, pastors, political leadersâ€”to defend Creation.'
