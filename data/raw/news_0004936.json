External Link: Bruce Springsteen Facebook: \"America is a nation of immigrants and we find this anti-democratic and fundamentally un-American.\" \nIn Adelaide Springsteen spoke out against Mr Trump's controversial announcement to temporarily ban immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, affecting Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. \n\"Tonight, we want to add our voices to the thousands of Americans who are protesting at airports around our country the Muslim ban and the detention of foreign nationals and refugees,\" Springsteen said to the crowd earlier in the week. \n\"America is a nation of immigrants.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:05:04.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
