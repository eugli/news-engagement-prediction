I think if this was in Victoria or New South Wales it would be announced the next day. \n\"There's a whole lot of funding available through the Wanderer scheme, but it has to be announced by the Premier to qualify for both state and federal assistance, and blind Freddy could tell you this is a major incident across the state.\" \nPremier Colin Barnett said on Sunday it was difficult at this stage to assess how much support would be offered by the state and federal governments because roads were still under water. \nMr Barnett said the state would move quickly once the extent of the damage was understood. \n\"There will be a full assessment with Main Roads along with local governments and we'll take it from there, but we've always stood by local communities when there's been damage to facilities like that, whether it's a result of fire or flood or whatever might happen,\" he said. Graziers start to count the cost \nFarmers in Western Australia's Great Southern are beginning to come to terms terms with the impacts of floods. \nWhile sheep graziers are breathing a sigh of relief that stock losses have been kept to a minimum, the bill for damaged infrastructure is expected to be extensive. \nDepartment of Agriculture and Food WA Esperance manager Brendan Nicholas said while the rainfall event was significant, its impact on livestock businesses had not been as severe as a similar event in 2007. \n\"There have been a few reports so far of sheep losses totalling up to 800 head right across the affected region, but nowhere near the stock losses of 2007, as the wind speeds were substantially lower this time,\" he said. Farmers feed livestock any way possible \nDumbleyung sheep and grain farmer Troy Smith said he had had significant amount of damage to fences, but the biggest challenge was how to feed the sheep. \nMr Smith uploaded a video to Facebook on Sunday that showed him paddling on a canoe to hand-feed four sheep stranded on small island in the middle of his paddock. \n\"We couldn't cross many of the creeks, we couldn't check sheep,\" he said. \n\"We had a handful of sheep that are just a month off lambing and we saw three sheep that were stuck on a rock in the middle of a swollen creek. \n\"The kids were a bit excited so we got the canoe and we paddled out there to see if we could get them to swim off. \n\"And they decided they weren't going to swim anywhere. \n\"They were pretty stubborn, so I went and got a bucket of lupins and dropped it to them on their little island, because I didn't know how long they'd be sitting there.\" \nThe Dumbleyung region received about 170mm over four days. \nMr Smith said his father Ken believed it was the widest spread damage in terms of fencing since the 1950s.

(Supplied: WA Police) Town has new lake \nFarmers in Newdegate, about 200km east of Narrogin, have reported similar impacts as they begin to drive on to paddocks to assess the damage. \nNewdegate farmer Anne Bishop said she had never seen the town look like it did. \n\"There's just lake extending from one side to the other, all at fence level,\" she said. \n\"We can just see the top of the fences poking out through the top of the water.\" \nMs Bishop said their feed stubbles had been ruined, and they were now struggling to get out on to some of their pastures. \n\"You can't be towing sheep feeders around and getting through these waterways easily with the sheep feeder behind you,\" she said.

(Supplied: Anne Bell) \nEast Cascade farmer Will Carmody flew over the floodwater on Sunday. \nHe said from what he had seen, in some paddocks the floodwater would remain on the surface for the year, which would take land out of production for grain farmers. \n\"It's filled up the bucket. What I'd estimate is if you had a 200 hectare paddock, there are some paddocks that are now only going to have 80 hectares of land, usable land where you are going to get a decent crop off,\" Mr Carmody said. \n\"So that is going to reduce the size of some of these cropping programs, so it's going to have quite a financial effect that way.\" Extent of damage unclear \nThe state's main grain handler is assessing if there is any damage to two of its major sites, in Borden and Esperance. \nVideos have been appearing online that show the Borden site, which is the one of the biggest in the Albany Port Zone, completely engulfed by water. \nAlbany Port Zone manager Greg Thornton said there would be grain and infrastructure damage, but they would not have a clear picture until later this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T10:17:08.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
