We have spiders and snakes and it’s pretty normal,” he said.\n“Obviously they’re not nice and you don’t want too many of them but you’ve just got to deal with them. They’re spiders and you can’t control them.”\nThe video has garnered almost two million views since being posted online on Wednesday evening.\nOriginally published as Redback spider attacks brown snake", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:47:45.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
