(Photo: Brianna Bradley/The Republic) \nI don’t know about you but I sure feel safe again.\nDonald Trump got his man … or in this case, his woman.\nSpecifically, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos.\nThe 36-year-old Mesa mother of two came to this country when she was 14 years old. She was nabbed in Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s workplace raid at Golfland/Sunsplash in 2008. She was convicted of identity theft and spent six months in federal detention but was released to her family rather than deported. This, because the Obama administration was concentrating on ridding the country of violent criminals rather than mothers working to support their children.\nTrump is going after mothers.\nGarcia was ordered to show up at an ICE office on Wednesday morning. There, she was promptly separated from her husband and her U.S.-born children, 16-year-old Angel and 14-year-old Jacqueline, and taken into custody.\nShe could be sent to a federal detention center to await deportation or deported immediately.\nTrump’s Jan. 25 executive order -- entitled \"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States\" -- makes it a priority to deport, among others, anyone here illegally who has been convicted of any crime or anyone who has been charged with any crime or anyone who has committed any act that could be considered a crime.\nAnd so Garcia, it seems, must go – regardless of why she did what she did.\nShe is, in Trump’s eyes, a criminal and a security threat and soon, I suppose, she’ll be gone.\nSo tell me, does this mean that America is safe again or just merely great again?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:13:44.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
