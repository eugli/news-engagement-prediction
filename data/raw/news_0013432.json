Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti state and President Muhammadu Buhari The governor vowed to challenge the action he described as the impunity by the anti-graft agency. READ ALSO: There is nothing good about Buhari’s administration - Fayose Daily Trust reports that governor Fayose, who stated this on Saturday 4th February in Ado-Ekiti in an interview with journalists, said he was at the bank's branch in Ado-Ekiti‎ on Friday 3rd February and was prevented from withdrawing money from his account despite the ruling of a Federal High Court which threw out EFCC's application for a Stay of Execution of its earlier judgment that his accounts be defrozen. Justice Taiwo Taiwo had last December given a judgment ordering the EFCC to de-freeze ‎Fayose's accounts however, the anti-graft agency approached the same court to seek stay of execution of the judgment, but the court threw out the agency's application saying it lacked merit. Fayose recalled that when he got to the bank, the officials claimed they were acting based on an undated Notice of Appeal the agency claimed it filed. He said: \"This is the impunity we are condemning. The bank and the EFCC got all the judgments of the court, but the agency still harassed the bank to act against the law. If I sent somebody with a cheque, they could give excuse but I was there myself and acts of impunity such as this cannot continue. We will challenge them,\" he said. On his recent election as the Chairman of the PDP Governors' Forum, Fayose said he never lobbied for it. \"My colleagues, in their wisdom, unanimously elected me the chairman of the forum. By the grace of God, we are going to reposition our party . The Peoples Democratic Party is only a sleeping giant and when it wakes up, those mocking us now will quake. Charlatans who are one leg in one leg out and causing confusion in the party would have to decide where to belong,\" he added. While appreciating journalists for their support, he advised them not to allow themselves to be drawn into politics. Doing so, he noted, would impugn on their integrity and make them inherit other people's enemies.
