Grown men pretending to be children, vomit inducing.” \nThe letter signed by the artists was backed by Help Refugees and Citizen UK's Safe Passage programme. \nIt states that it is \"completely unacceptable\" to \"slam the door shut after just 350 children have reached safety\". Getty Prime Minister Theresa May is being urged not to scrap the Dubs programme for child migrants Getty A host of celebrities have urged Theresa May to allow more child migrants into the UK \nIt reads: \"Lord Dubs was himself a child saved by Sir Nicholas Winton who rescued 669 children virtually single-handed. \n\"It is embarrassing that the Prime Minister's entire Government will not even manage to match the example set by her former constituent all those years ago, let alone the efforts of the Kindertransport movement of which he was a part which saved 10,000 children from the Nazis.\" \nThe government announced earlier this month that it would be scrapping the programme for resettling lone youngsters from mainland Europe to the UK. \nBut it has faced a chorus of opposition to its plans from celebrities and members of the opposition parties. Getty Jude Law and Ralph Fiennes are among the actors who signed the letter to Ms May \nDeputy Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron renewed calls for Theresa May not to abandon child refugees by scrapping the Dubs scheme, the Lib Dem Press Office tweeted on Tuesday. \nBut this was met with a tide of anger on the social media site. \nOne user tweeted: “Typical Lib Dems. Putting these fake ‘child refugees’ ahead of the British people.” \n“How about the 900 Syrian “refugees” arrested for a variety of crimes, including sex crimes. \nAnother tweeted: “Tim please explain why we need to rescue child refugees from France… please.” \nDespite this, artists, authors, actors, musicians and broadcasters including Coldplay, Juliet Stevenson, Gok Wan, Caroline Flack, Jude Law, Michael Morpurgo, Douglas Booth, Joely Richardson, Lily Allen, Sir Mark Rylance and Ruby Wax - have signed the letter to Mrs May. \nJosie Naughton, co-founder of Help Refugees, said: \"The outpouring of support for the continuation of the Dubs scheme by these well-known figures and the public demonstrates that its closure is at odds with the British values that make this country great.” \nHowever, one commenter hit back online. \nThe user tweeted: “We wouldn’t mind if they were children but the last lot obviously were not. Trying to fool the public backfired.” Related videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:54:10.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
