What started as a small route between two Northwest cities has expanded massively. Currently, service is offered between several Northwest cities—Portland and Eugene, Oregon; Seattle and Bellingham; and Vancouver, BC, and connecting to stops all throughout California and Nevada. The list continues to grow as the demand for express bus service expands, and as more and more people seek to travel up and down the West Coast. \nBoltBus is a newer bus service, previously only offered in the Northeast, but provides an incredibly cheap way to travel, with perks above and beyond your average bus trip. Don't expect cramped seating and other mainstays of average bus travel! These buses are fairly comfortable and provide perks like Wi-Fi for the duration of your journey. \nOf course, BoltBus is just one way to get between the biggest cities of the Northwest. \ncontinue reading below our video Best Ride Sharing Apps of 2015 You can also take short commuter flights out of Sea-Tac International Airport , catch an Amtrak train (stations in most cities) or ride Greyhound . BoltBus Stations in the Northwest \nThe list of stations in the Northwest and on the West Coast overall continues to grow. Formerly, BoltBus riders could only go between Portland, Seattle and Vancouver. \nEugene: 296 E. 5th Avenue \nPortland: 648 SW Salmon Street \nSeattle: 5 th Avenue South and King Street \nBellingham: 4194 Cordata Parkway \nVancouver, B.C.:1150 Station Street-Gate 4 \nOther West Coast stops include San Jose, San Francisco, Los Angles, Barstow and Las Vegas, as well as others. Facts about Riding BoltBus \nWhile bus travel has a reputation as a way to travel on the cheap and often sacrifices comfort, BoltBus is a bus line like no other. Where other buses might be just a cheap way to get from point A to point B, BoltBus provides luxury and service to its riders several steps above what you’d expect. \nRider perks include Wi-Fi, power outlets, leather seats and legroom. In fact, you'll likely have far more legroom on these buses than you will on most modern airliners! \nBoltBus also utilizes boarding groups so that you don’t have to fight your way to a good seat, or at the very least you know where you stand during the boarding process. All tickets guarantee a seat. Riders are allowed two small carry-ons, and one large piece of luggage in the cargo hold (bikes included). \nThere are several buses that go between each of the cities each day so you can choose morning, mid-day and evening departure or arrival times. Fares \nEven better, BoltBus is cheaper than just about any other way to travel, including many other bus routes. Fares can be as low as a $1 (plus a booking fee). If you want those $1 fares, make sure to book well in advance. It's easier to find the $1 fares if you travel mid-week instead of on a weekend or peak time, but there's no cheaper way to get between Seattle and Portland or Vancouver if you're available on a Wednesday night! If you don’t get the $1 fares, none of the BoltBus fares are expensive and usually hover in the $25 per leg range. How to Buy Tickets \nFor fare and schedule information, or to purchase tickets, visit BoltBus.com . \nYou can also buy tickets the day of travel from a bus driver, but for full fare only. Frequent travelers are able to sign up for the Bolt Rewards program, which is similar to a frequent flier program where you'll get reward based on traveling more often. \nYou can also buy tickets through the BoltBus app, available in the iTunes and Google Play stores.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:08:11.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
