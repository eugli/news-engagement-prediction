After announcing the rebranding of Withings’ portfolio which is coming in Summer 2017, the company decided to announce the global availability of the Nokia 6, as well as some new devices. The Nokia 6 is a smartphone which was announced last month, and has been available for sale in China. Nokia revealed that they have been selling a lot of Nokia 6 handsets in China, and that the consumers’ satisfaction rate is 97%. The phone has been available exclusively through JingDong Mall (JD.com) in China, which is one of the largest retailers in China. \nAll three Nokia-branded smartphones that were announced today will become available in the second quarter of this year, though Nokia did not say when exactly. Nokia said that all three of these devices offer great build quality, and reiterated that the company is focused on bringing forth Android smartphones which are backed by Google’s clean software (no skins), and are also secured because of it. You will not find any bloatware on Nokia’s smartphones, nor anything of the sort. That being said, the Nokia 6 will be priced at €229, the Nokia 5 will cost €189, and you will be able to grab the Nokia 3 for €139. \nNow, Nokia did not release all that much spec info when it comes to these smartphones (though we already know Nokia 6’s specs), but they did share some. The Nokia 3 is the smaller one of the pack, this smartphone sports a 5-inch display. The Nokia 5 is the next in line with a 5.2-inch display, and last, but not least, the Nokia 6 with a 5.5-inch panel. The MediaTek MT6737 64-bit quad-core SoC fuels the Nokia 3, while the Snapdragon 430 64-bit octa-core SoC comes with both the Nokia 5 and Nokia 6. In addition to all this, the company also introduced a special edition Nokia 6 handset, the Nokia 6 Arte Black, which offers a glossy black finish. All of these smartphones are made out of aluminum, by the way, in case you were wondering. Nokia will probably share more spec info in the coming days / weeks, and if you’d like to know more about the Nokia 6, click here .
