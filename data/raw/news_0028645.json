We’ve been in the industry for six, seven years, and there hasn’t been any dog that has opened the cage this way,” said Cao Sheng, the owner of the store. \nThe Husky has an owner but was temporarily placed in the shop for an unexplained reason. \nThe dog created a big mess in the pet shop with its escapade and was locked in a sturdier cage with double locks afterwards, CCTV cited the shop owner as saying, adding that the dog owner would bear all the costs of damage caused by the Husky. \n“We call the Husky one of ‘the three stupid sled dogs,’ and it is the dumbest. Very few of them can open cages. The whole thing was totally unexpected,” said Cao. \n-With files from The Associated Press © 2017 Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:36:05.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
