Judith Reichman, MD, a respected Los Angeles OB-GYN and author of several women’s health handbooks, reveals what you can do to get through the change... Insomnia, night sweats, agitation and hot flashes: Classic menopausal symptoms can start long before your periods stop – and pop up when you least expect them. Besides the annoying signs of perimenopause (the stage before your last period), women can look forward to these other conditions: Low or no sex drive, incontinence, overactive bladder and hormone imbalance – just to name a few. With all the information out there, it’s hard to know how to navigate your health vs. comfort. What can you treat and what should you suffer through? Can you safely use hormone replacement therapy to lessen menopausal symptoms? How do you sift through the volumes of explanations, home remedies and medical advice to find exactly what to do? In this Lifescript exclusive, Los Angeles OB-GYN Judith Reichman, MD , author of Relax, This Won’t Hurt: Painless Answers to Women’s Most Pressing Health Questions (Harper Collins), answers our questions and offers the facts, warning signs and available treatments. What are some signs of perimenopause? The patient will say, “One day, I’m having hot flashes, the next day, my breasts hurt.” Or “I had a period, then I didn’t have it for two months,” as well as, “I just feel like someone took over my body and I’m not in control anymore.” I call it a dress rehearsal for menopause. What do women going through menopause experience? If a woman is symptomatic, she may have hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, and mood changes. Some patients even say their cognition changes. She may also complain that having sex hurts and she has no sex drive. Every symptom in a woman over age 50 is attributed to hormones, whether that’s true or not. Do hot flashes last forever? Most women stop having hot flashes within 2-5 years [after going through menopause]. Fifteen percent of women have them for the rest of their lives. How can hot flashes be treated? For a woman who is significantly symptomatic – she can’t concentrate or sleep – the general consensus is if she doesn’t have a history of breast cancer, clotting problems or a cancer that had anything to do with estrogen, the pros of taking hormone replacement therapy in the first few years outweigh the cons. When should a woman consider hormone replacement therapy? Anyone who goes through a very early menopause should go on hormones – unless she has some major contraindication. With very early menopause, before age 40 or some say 45, if she doesn’t take hormone replacement therapy, she’s at higher risk for coronary vascular disease, osteoporosis and earlier dementia. Whether the early menopause is natural or because she had surgery or radiation, there’s no question a young woman should be treated. What problems can arise from extended hormone replacement therapy? Continuing HRT long term increases your risk for breast cancer, especially if [the patient is] taking estrogen and progesterone because she still has a uterus. If she’s had a hysterectomy – and they do 600,000 of these every year – then she only needs estrogen. The risk for breast cancer isn’t quite as high for women on estrogen only. Hormone replacement therapy is controversial. Can you explain why? The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study that came out a number of years ago really scared a lot of women. The study was on Prempro. They had about 25,000 women, half on and half off, and they found an increased risk in breast cancer [among the women taking estrogen plus progestin]. Actually, the study was meant to see if hormone therapy diminished coronary vascular disease. It didn’t, but it did decrease fracture rates and reduced colon cancer. Was it a realistic study? The problem with that study is that most of the women were older, had gone through menopause, and who were 10-15 years postmenopausal . The average age [of the women] they checked was early 60s. How would that influence the data? The question becomes this: Is what they found in these older women applicable to a woman who’s 51 [or younger]? The last few years has been devoted to arguing over that. Today, the thought is that in the early years of menopause, hormones can be very efficacious. But, we don’t want to give hormones to a woman without menopausal symptoms in her 60s. How do patients do when they quit hormones? When a patient says, “How long should I take HRT? Should I stop?” I say, “You can stop and there are studies that show stopping cold turkey or stopping with diminished doses doesn’t really make a difference [how the hormone leaves your body]. But we’ll see what happens to your menopausal symptoms.” If a woman had serious menopausal symptoms before she started, chances are those symptoms will recur when she stops therapy. If she says, “What should I do?” I say, “Always go to the lowest dose that helps you. Know that if you continue taking hormones, at some point you are making a quality-of-life decision vs. risk.” We make that quality-of-life decision every time we go on the freeway, every time we don’t exercise, every time we have that extra sundae. Life is full of quality-of-life-vs.-risk decisions. This is one of them. Which tests should women with menopausal symptoms get? Menopause isn’t a woman’s only health issue. Women over 50 should be having mammograms – and yearly. They should definitely be having their cholesterol checked and pelvic exams too. I check something called hemoglobin A1C. That’s the tattletale blood test to see if blood sugars have been elevated in the last three months. If patients are at a high risk to develop diabetes, I look at their weight. We discuss diet and exercise. There’s something called “successful survival.” It means you’ve reached 70 and you don’t have any major diseases. The best way to get there is exercise. We go over that. Also, if women aren’t going on hormones or if they’re at risk for osteoporosis, I want them to get a bone density scan – and I yell at them if they haven’t gotten a colonoscopy. I tell patients it’s more important to get a colonoscopy than to see me. I also check to see if they have elevated inflammatory levels. They need to get their skin checked once or twice a year for pre-cancer and cancer. They also need to get their eyes checked and teeth cleaned. And all that’s aside from getting their roots done.
