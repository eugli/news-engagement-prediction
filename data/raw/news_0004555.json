Wishing everyone an amazing year to come during these days of celebration. 新年快乐！\nA video posted by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Feb 2, 2017 at 4:30am PST\n“Wishing everyone an amazing year to come during these days of celebration.”\nIvanka Trump then added in Chinese characters: “Happy New Year!”\nThe post appeared after Ivanka Trump took her daughter to the Chinese Embassy in Washington to attend a reception celebrating the annual spring festival on Wednesday.\n‘She really likes China’: Ivanka Trump is surprise guest at Chinese embassy’s Lunar New Year party\nThe visit and her Twitter message were the only personal new year greetings made by the Trump family to the Chinese community because the US President – unlike his predecessors – has not sent any new year’s greeting on the official White House website.\nIvanka Trump has often shared videos and pictures of Arabella speaking Chinese and celebrating Chinese culture because her daughter has been learning the language since she was 18 months old. Arabella was shown wearing a red Chinese-embroidered dress while reciting a poem in Putonghua in a video posted on her mother’s Twitter account during last year’s holiday.\nWhy is Donald Trump giving Chinese leader Xi Jinping the apparent cold shoulder?\nDonald Trump’s relationship with China has been tense since his election campaign after he called the country a “currency manipulator” in his campaign pledge on trade.\nBut he did speak to President Xi Jinping by phone in November, after his election victory, before he took office .\nOne comment by a reader on the mainland news website news.163.com, who watched Arabella singing in the latest video, said: “Cute girl, good singing. Pure children do not have conspiracies.”\nHowever, other netizens were not happy that the US President had not sent any personal Lunar New Year greeting, saying: “He is just trying to brush us off with this five year old girl.”", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BQAl9KsgObM/"], "published": "2017-02-03T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:38:52.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
