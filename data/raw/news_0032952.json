(Zach Gibson / AP) Philip Bump The Washington Post \nOver the course of the lengthy and bizarre news conference that President Trump held Thursday, few moments crystallized the unusual nature of his presidency as effectively as an exchange he had at the end with April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks. \nRyan asked Trump if he would include the CBC in discussions about his agenda for addressing urban policy. The CBC is the Congressional Black Caucus, a group of African-American legislators that is often a leading voice on the Hill for issues dealing with the black community. Trump appeared briefly to be unaware of what the initials stood for, and so Ryan asked more pointedly. \n\"Am I going to include who?\" he asked. \n\"Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus,\" Ryan, who is black, asked, \"and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus as well as . . .?\" \n\"Well, I would,\" Trump interrupted. \"Tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting? Do you want to set up the meeting? Are they friends of yours? Set up a meeting.\" \nRyan pointed out to the president that she is a journalist and that, while she does know members of the CBC, that's not her role. \"I'm sure some of them are watching right now,\" she added. \nTrump went on to say that he had been trying to set up a meeting with Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee and a CBC member. He then claimed that Cummings had balked at following through, but the CBC tweeted its side of the story. \nThe tweet read: \"Hi, @realDonaldTrump. We're the CBC. We sent you a letter on January 19, but you never wrote us back. Sad! Letter: https://t.co/58KiuHmITF.\" \nThis wasn't the first dust-up between Ryan and the White House . \nOn Monday, Ryan accused Trump aide Omarosa Manigault of having physically intimidated her near the Oval Office and that Manigault claimed the administration was maintaining \"dossiers\" of information on members of the media. (White House press secretary Sean Spicer denied that this was the case in his daily briefing on Wednesday.) \nDuring the campaign, Manigault accused Ryan of being on the payroll of Hillary Clinton, thanks to a misinterpretation of an email released by WikiLeaks. This history is probably why Trump also told Ryan that her question was \"very professional, very good.\" \nHowever, the weirdness of the Trump-Ryan exchange on Thursday extends beyond the reporter's relationship with the administration. Trump's suggestion that a black reporter is somehow allied with or working on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus is fraught for obvious reasons, but also came shortly after Trump insisted, without being prompted, that he was not racist. \n\"Racism: [I'm] the least racist person,\" he said in response to one question. \"In fact, we did very well, relative to other people, as a Republican.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:10:33.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
