Published:February 6, 2017 10:46 am Senator Bernard Sanders speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) \nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders called US President Donald Trump a “fraud” and accused him of falling short of commitments to middle-class voters, pointing to his Cabinet and senior advisers’ ties to Wall Street, the media reported. “This guy is a fraud,” Sanders, also a former presidential hopeful, told CNN on Sunday. \nWatch What Else Is Making News \n“This guy ran for President of the United States saying, ‘I, Donald Trump, I’m going to take on Wall Street — these guys are getting away with murder’. Then suddenly, he appoints all these billionaires,” Sanders said. Trump selected Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs trader and hedge fund manager, as his treasury secretary nominee; Wilbur Ross, a billionaire and former banker, to lead the Commerce Department; and Gary Cohn, a top Goldman Sachs executive, to lead his National Economic Council. \nSanders said Trump’s Cabinet appointments and advisers directly contradict his pledge to re-institute the Glass-Steagall Act, a regulation that separated commercial and investment banks, which was repealed under former President Bill Clinton . Trump signed an executive order on February 3 that sets the stage for rewriting US financial regulation in an effort to encourage more lending to American businesses. \n“He is a good showman, I will give you that — he is a good TV guy,” Sanders said of Trump. “But I think he is going to sell out the middle class, the working class, of this country.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:17:54.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
