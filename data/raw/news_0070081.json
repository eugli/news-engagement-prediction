'When we found out Ben's face just went white,' she said. 'But for two or three weeks were in denial - we just thought the doctor was new and might not know.' 'Then I saw the obstetrician we had with Charlie and he confirmed it - I have never been so nervous in my life.' The young mother remembers being shocked when she found out she would be having twins so soon after her first pregnancy But because she was frightened she was 'in denial' for a few months before she started 'showing' Her boys were born in December and weighed over three kilograms each Ms Curby was in denial for a few more weeks until her pregnant belly began to show - then she realised she had to prepare her life for the two unexpected arrivals. Then it was her turn to shock her friends and family. 'I was really excited to tell them I knew they were going be way more shocked than I was,' she said. 'When we went to dad and told him we had exciting news he thought we were going to get married. 'Then when we said we were going for round two, with twins his face turned to horror.' The young mum is now writing down her experiences in a quirky blog which highlights what it is like to have three babies under one. Her daughter charlie has become friends with the family dog and favours Ben, according to Ms Curby The proud mum and dad were shocked when they first found out about having twins but over the moon with their family The couple have been together for two years - and now have three children together From switching up her trusty 4WD to a mum-van to planning how to leave the house and then facing the gaze of strangers once she is there. 'The other day I was walking down the street and people were staring at me like I was some kind of dog-walker but for kids,' she said. 'I sat down at a cafe but had to leave because I was so embarrassed by all the staring.' Ms Curby has been with Ben for just two years and joked 'he has never known me not pregnant - at least I am not as emotional now'. 'We are a pretty good team so our relationship has been surprisingly fine with all these changes,' she said. Ms Curby shortly before she became pregnant with her twin boys The young mother now expresses her own milk because feeding both babies at once was difficult The young mum doesn't have any tips for any other mums in the same situation 'He also loves being a dad.' In fact the couple's eldest child and little girl Charlie has already picked him as the 'favourite'. 'When I was pregnant I was too big to play with her so she did a lot of stuff with dad.' The young mum doesn't have any tips for any other mums in the same situation. 'I was trying to think of some tips the other day for my blog and realised I probably don't have it together enough for that yet.' 'I feel like it has taken me eight weeks, since the boys were born, to get my head above water.' Ms Curby said by the time her first born Charlie was a six-month-old she thought she had the 'baby thing down pat' but having to do it all over again with twins is 'completely different'. 'It is like I have had to start all over again. But now it is just everything in threes, three bibs, three baby seats - three everything.'
