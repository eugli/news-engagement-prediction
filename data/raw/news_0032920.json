I am so excited. I am blown away by the number of people. It has given me much more confidence to go out and spread my message. \n\"People should not be afraid to be who they are.\" \nNigel Booth, founder of Beyond the Mask, said: \"I think it is fair to say that for Callum this is just the beginning and he is literally wanting to take this to the world and inspire as many people as he can. \n\"It's always a shock for people what happens when they stop thinking what to say and start to say what they are thinking and this is just what Callum has done.\" \nCallum's mother, Kelly Burnham, said: \"It has been fantastic. It is unbelievable.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:24:58.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
