Trump's great grip cost Clinton \nTrudeau's achievement was a major one, as Trump has built a career on dominating all around him with his astounding handshake skills, dragging flunky and statesman alike into his orbit with that ferocious jerk. \nSo feared did Trump's handshake become over the decades that Hillary Clinton tried to dodge it during the presidential debates, only to see her campaign founder on the perception that she wasn't up for the handfight. \nNot that violence is Trump's only play in the shake stakes. \nRecently he met with President Shinzo Abe of Japan and showed an unsuspected tender side, taking Abe's hand gently in his and squeezing it tight, stroking it affectionately, and softly whispering his devotion to it. \nIt was a masterful piece of diplomacy that demonstrated that Trump knows there is a time to make love to a hand, and a time to yank it clean off the arm. \nIn mastering the myriad intricacies of the handshake he is following in a proud political tradition. \nThomas Jefferson was the first US president to make handshaking a presidential habit, seeing the pressing of palms as a way to bring the presidency closer to the common man. \nSince then the handshake has come to be seen as a powerful tool of political communication.

(AP: Patrick Semansky) The power of palms \nIn 1977, Atlantic City Mayor Joseph Lazarow won the lasting love of his people when he entered the Guinness Book of World Records by shaking 11,000 hands in one day. \nHe surpassed the record of Teddy Roosevelt, who performed 8,510 handshakes on January 1, 1907, and probably still had the energy to shoot a moose afterwards. \nWe can see how politicians who recognise the power of the handshake achieve a unique connection to their constituency. \nOn the flipside, those who fail to master the handshake may find themselves floundering. \nThe awkward three-way between Obama, Trudeau and Nieto showed the world just how ill-fitting the alliance between the North American powers is. \nWhen John Kerry greeted Francois Hollande, apparently under the belief that a handshake is just a prelude to a slow dance, it damaged the US-French relationship irreparably. \nAnd of course in our own country, the 2004 federal election was won and lost on a handshake. \nIf opposition leader Mark Latham had shown a little more restraint when meeting prime minister John Howard, instead of trying to snap his elderly arm like a twig, he might be PM today.

(Public Domain: Abbie Rowe) \nThese are important matters that cannot be left to chance, which is why, no matter what else Trump does in office, it's a relief to see him taking the matter of handshakes seriously. \nAmerica will remain strong as long as its leader is challenging others to resist his crushing tug, and thus spurring those others to lift their own interphalangeal game. \nThe current focus on handshakes also provides an opportunity to start a conversation about centring the handshake even more effectively in public life. \nNow that we've accepted that a power struggle between the leaders of America and Canada can be boiled down to who came out of the handshake better, we can move on to basing all our systems of geopolitical interaction on this once-humble gesture of etiquette. He with the firmest grip wins \nThere will be no need, for example, for lengthy trade negotiations between nations: each country simply puts its preferred deal on the table, the trade ministers shake hands, and whoever inspires the most confidence with their clasp wins. \nIt will be a cheaper, more efficient, and vastly more civilised way of conducting affairs. \nWe missed a trick with the aforementioned 2004 election: we all knew that the handshake was where the poll was won and lost, but we never took the logical next step of removing all the campaigning and voting palaver and deciding elections on a handshake basis.

(AAP: Mick Tsikas) \nAn independent council of respected community elders can be employed to judge the electoral handshake, and on the appointed day, the leaders of the parties will come together for a good healthy shake. \nWhoever is considered to have the firmest grip, while not applying so much pressure as to undermine public confidence — Latham-style — becomes prime minister. \nThe whole thing is done in less than 20 minutes and we're all much happier. \nIt isn't difficult to bring about this new age. \nAll it takes is a little political will, and the receptiveness of the ruling class to the truth that handshaking is the way forward. \nWe are almost there already: when the president shakes a hand, the world now stops in its track. \nWe need only take that final step, and the shake-ruled world we yearn for will come to pass at last.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:11:51.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
