Victim: Mustafa Farah \nAccording to a local cafe owner who tried to defuse the situation, Mr Farah was \"out of it\" before Brunel University student Awil hit him with a distinctive red and blue pole, the court heard. \nThe cafe owner described a tall man with an iron bar being \"egged on\" while another man was heard to say: \"He's not worth it. He's drunk. Let's just leave it.\" \nMr Farah, who was of Somali heritage and lived in Camden with his family, collapsed in the street and died in hospital eight days later. \nPathologist Ashley Fegan-Earl found he had suffered a heart attack as a result of being struck in the vagus nerve in the neck, something he had only seen three times in 17,000 post-mortem examinations. A shopping trolley handle allegedly used as in the fight \nAfter the fight, 20-year-old Abukar Yahye drove Awil to Victoria Coach Station from where he fled to the Netherlands, the court heard. Days later, he returned to England and handed himself in to police. \nThe weapon, a 50cm long shopping trolley bar, was retrieved by police from a wheelie bin. The court heard that two fingerprints on it matched Awil's right hand.
