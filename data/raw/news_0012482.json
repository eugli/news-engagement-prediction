Lady Gaga wows audience at Super Bowl half-time show \nWhile holed up in a fleabag hotel in New York City during a marathon writing session in 1940 during which he penned 'Hangknot Slipknot', 'The Government Road' and 'Dirty Overalls', he kept hearing the Kate Smith hit on the radio. \nIn an irritated fit, he wrote the words for an response song he sarcastically titled, 'God Blessed America for Me', according to NPR. Each verse also ended with this line. Watch Lady Gaga's Super Bowl halftime show in full \nIt wasn’t seemingly meant as a love song to his country. As noted pop critic David Cantwell wrote in Slate: \"Guthrie had battled his way through the Depression-torn 1930s, boots on the ground, from Texas to Los Angeles and all around the American West. \nWhat he’d seen during his hard travelin’ — prejudice and hatred and violence, crowded labor camps, empty stomachs and hungry eyes — led him to conclude that heavenly endorsement was the last thing America had coming.\" \nEventually, he scratched this title off the lyric sheet, replacing it with 'This Land is Your Land'. He also replaced the closing line of each verse. \nAfter borrowing the melody from a 1930 gospel recording “When the World’s on Fire” to strum on his guitar, which was famously adorned with a sticker reading 'This Machine Kills Fascists', he was ready to perform the new tune. \nIn 1944, he recorded it with Moses Asch, but that version mostly disappeared. It wasn’t published until 1997. Had it been, Americans may have viewed the tune in a different light. \nAs Robert Santelli wrote in This Land Is Your Land: Woody Guthrie and the Journey of an American Folk Song , the version of ‘This Land is Your Land’ that most Americans claim familiarity with does not contain the lyrics that doubt America’s integrity or questions the country’s commitment to essential freedoms. \nThose lyrics in the fourth and sixth verses of the song often have been washed away or simply ignored, which is why ‘This Land Is Your Land’ has been able to stand side by side with the other great patriotic paeans to America. \nThe Asch recording contained one of these two verses. The official recording, released years later, contained neither. Gaga did not sing them either during the halftime performance. \nThe forgotten fourth verse, included in the 1944 recording, feels particularly prescient in the infancy of a new administration led by a president who has imposed a travel ban on citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries. Consider that President Trump signed executive actions to build a border wall with Mexico, and it sounds downright prophetic. \nThere was a big high wall there that tried to stop me. \nThe sign was painted, said ‘Private Property.’ \nBut on the backside, it didn’t say nothing. \nThis land was made for you and me. \nThe meaning is as blunt as the sign he sings about. America claims to be for everyone, but it isn’t. Read more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T20:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T15:54:04.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
