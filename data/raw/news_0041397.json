Restaged by BP’s Nonoy Froilan, “Swan Lake” will have three pairings for the main characters Prince Siegfried and Odette (the sweet swan)/Odile (the nasty swan): Candice Adea and Joseph Phillips; Denise Parungao and Garry Corpuz; and Jemima Reyes and Victor Maguad. \nThis was announced at a recent press conference at CCP, which featured sparkling performances by Reyes as the White Swan and Maguad as Siegfried, and Parungao as the Black Swan and Corpuz as Siegfried. ADVERTISEMENT Maguad as Siegfried in “Swan Lake \nMarch 4, incidentally, will be the 140th anniversary of the ballet’s premiere in Russia, and multi-awarded guest stars Adea and Phillips will perform on that date at CCP. \nDuring the open forum, younger dancers Reyes and Parungao recounted the challenges they faced by playing innocent Odette and then shifting to scheming Odile in the next act. “It’s not normal being a swan,” quipped the more experienced Adea, back home after a four-year absence. “You’re a half-woman and a half-swan. So I just simplified.” \n“I just take it step by step,” noted Phillips, whether he was dancing in a classical or contemporary ballet. Jemima Reyes as Odile \nBallet Philippines has staged many full-length productions of “Swan Lake” since 1980, featuring luminaries foreign and Filipino, like Yukio Morishita and Maniya Barredo. The company has not produced the work in more than 20 years “and that is why we have put a lot of effort into this production,” said BP artistic director Paul Morales. \nGala of Ballet Philippines’ “Swan Lake” on Feb 24, 8 p.m., at CCP in an international gala featuring guest stars Candice Adea (formerly of Hong Kong Ballet and BalletMet) and Joseph Phillips of the Primorsky Stage of Mariinsky Theatre. —CONTRIBUTED \nOther schedules: Feb. 25 at 2 and 7 p.m.; Feb. 26 at 3 p.m.; March 3 at 8 p.m.; March 4 at 2 and 7 p.m., and March 5 at 3 p.m. \nCall Ticketworld at 8919999.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:22:02.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
