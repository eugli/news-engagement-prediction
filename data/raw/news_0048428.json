It’s as simple as that. \nThe new Olympics ‘cycle’ starts this month when the Matildas head to Portugal to play in the Algarve Cup, with group matches against Sweden, the Netherlands and China. \nThis will prepare the side for big international tournaments in 2019 (Women’s World Cup) and 2020 (the Tokyo Olympics). \nFFA chairman Steven Lowy also recently flagged the governing body’s intention to bid for the 2023 Women’s World Cup , which would expedite the need to push the Matildas to the top. \nBut in order to achieve success at these major tournaments, Australian football needs to increase the size and professionalism of the talent pool available to the Matildas. Kyah Simon celebrates a goal at the 2015 Women's World Cup.   \nPFA chief executive John Didulica drew upon the situation that unfolded in the 2016 Rio Olympics quarter-final, where key midfielder Elise Kellond-Knight was forced to cover for injured left-back Steph Catley because of the “dearth of left-sided players” available. \nEssentially, there aren’t enough quality players to consistently compete with the world’s best teams. \nWith 60 per cent of W-League players having represented either the Young Matildas or the Matildas, it’s clear the local competition plays a key role in developing this talent pool. \nTo put it simply, if Australia is going to be the world’s best, it needs a local competition that can compete with the world’s best. \nWHERE IS AUSTRALIAN WOMEN’S FOOTBALL FALLING BEHIND? \nThe PFA’s research indicated a combination of substandard salaries, working conditions and pathways sets the W-League behind its rivals. \nThe 14-game home and away season falls well short of the top leagues, including Germany, France, Japan and the USA — countries which are powerhouses in women’s football. \nThe W-League’s average salary is also dwarfed by its international competitors. \nThe PFA’s 2016 W-League Workplace Conditions Report — which surveyed 111 W-League players — confirmed 85 per cent of players earned less than $5,000 for the season, with 25 per cent of players earning less than $500 for the entire season. \nThe W-League also falls behind other women’s sports in a number of key areas, including its salary safety net, its minimum standards across medical and health, and its alignment with respective men’s programs. \nAll of these factors contribute to players either being under immense duress during their career, or retiring early.

Source: AAP \nTo put it in perspective: the average age of players of teams that made the final of the World Cup (Canada 2015) and Olympics (Rio 2016) falls between 26 and 30. \nAs things stand in Australia, the average W-League player breaks into the national competition before the age of 18 but leaves the professional level by the time they’re 24. \nToo many players are lost to professional football before hitting their peak which did not help the Matildas’ 2016 Olympics campaign. \nAustralia fizzled in the group stages, before exiting in the quarter-finals on penalties to Brazil. Aside from a draw — which should have been a win — against eventual champions Germany, the Matildas failed to impress in the tournament. \nHad the Matildas been able to earn a medal, it would have boosted funding for women’s football, which could in turn have played a key role in turning that achievement into a sustained cycle of success.

This would allow every team to play each other twice, with the increased length allowing for greater competitiveness throughout the season. \nClubs would be required to field two teams in their state’s NPL competition \nThe league would have an extended pre-season, to allow players to finish their overseas seasons, while the NPL seasons would ideally commence directly after the W-League finals, to allow players to continue playing football year-round. \nIn regards to pay, the PFA intends to divide the women’s football into three clear salary-based categories.

Source: AAP \nThe upper echelon of this group would be the ‘60 @ 60’ category, which would allow at least 60 players to earn $60,000 per annum over a four-year cycle. \nThese players would be those in the frame for Matildas selection, with a view to developing them over the major tournament ‘cycles’. \nThese contracts would be subsidised through national team contracts, W-League contracts, overseas contracts and a National Women’s Football Network. \nThis network would help players connect with employment opportunities that subsidise their football earnings, allowing the athletes to focus on football first and foremost. \nThe second key category of players would be the ‘seasonal professional’, who would be engaged for the full season. \nThese players would have to earn a minimum of approximately $11,500 for their work that season. \nThe third category would be the ‘amateur’ player, which would largely focus on elevating young players from the NPL. Due to their status, they would have a different contract structure to the other two categories, with the minimum remuneration likely to be on par with National Youth League and NPL players. \nThe PFA model for 20-player W-League squads would ideally feature six ‘60 @ 60’ players, eight ‘seasonal professionals’ and a further six ‘amateur players’. \nEssentially, W-League roster spend would be a minimum of $173,856 per season. \nHOW WOULD IT BE RESOURCED? \nThe PFA’s funding model includes an additional $1.49m on top of the $3.146m currently invested in W-League players. \nThis would be achieved through three key sources: clubs (an extra $69,000 each), the entrance of a 10th team ($173,000) and additional funding coming through players receiving flexible jobs within the football industry through a yet-to-be-created National Women’s Football Network. \nFor example, 14 jobs at $50,000 per annum would add another $700,000 to the pot. \nThe PFA also recommends the FFA provide an additional $175,000 to clubs (up from approximately $50,000) to help subsidise the increased salaries. \nSO CAN IT BE ACHIEVED? \nThere are two key entities standing in the way of this plan coming to fruition. \nThe FFA and the A-League/W-League clubs. \nFirstly, the clubs would need to be prepared to offer the additional investment in their programs, while backing their ability to recoup their expenses. \nThe PFA’s plan for clubs to break even from their W-League expenses relies heavily on clubs being able to build on their commercial presence through women’s football. \nWomen’s sport may be booming, but the PFA plan requires another level of corporate investment. \nEssentially, if the clubs aren’t able to meet those targets, it would be extremely difficult to cover the costs of running the improved program. \nSecondly, FFA would have to be willing to both cover the required dividends and commit to the extended season and competition restructure. \nWhile the PFA’s plan is ambitious and well-constructed, ultimately it’s dependent on whether the FFA and the clubs come to the party.
