[PHOTO: PHOTO: JONAH ONYANGO/STANDARD] \nThe national Sevens team Strength and Conditioning coach Ian Gibbons has resigned. \nHis resignation comes barely a fortnight after the team’s dismal performance at the Sydney and Wellington Sevens in Australia and New Zealand where Kenya collected a paltry eight points to slip to the eleventh position in the World Sevens rankings with 25 points behind leaders South Africa. \nGibbons resigned without stating reasons at a time Kenya faces a gigantic task of in Las Vegas, USA and Vancouver, Canada from March 4-5. \nThough it is not clear the reasons behind the coach's exit, Kenya Rugby Union has said it will announce a replacement soon with the decision coming just over two weeks to the Las Vegas leg of the World Rugby Sevens series in the United States. \n“We wish to confirm Gibbons’ resignation and thank him for his service during the time he has been with the team and wish well in his future endeavors,” read a statement by the rugby union sent to newsrooms. Gibbons penned a six-month deal that started in December 2016 that was due to run until the end of the current season in May 2017. \nKRU Chairman Richard Omwela downplayed his departure saying,“His resignation will not affect our performance in the forthcoming series of the World Sevens Championships. Furthermore, we have the capacity to replace him,” Omwela told Feverpitch.

He was charged with ensuring all players were physically fit with the assistance of other members of the technical bench. It was upon him with his counterparts to effectively discharge their duty ahead of the Sydney/Wellington Championships instead of crying foul,” Omwela said. \nCoach Simiyu is scheduled to announce the squad for Las Vegas and Vancouver Sevens at Rugby Football Union of East Africa on Thursday. \nIn the meantime, the union is making frantic efforts to name Gibbons’ replacement ahead of Las Vegas and Vancouver Sevens Championships.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:31:00.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
