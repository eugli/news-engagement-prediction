We've never gone down that road as an organization,\" she said.\nOn occasion, LeClair said some of the hospital's third-party fundraisers will go door to door, but they have a letter of endorsement. These fundraising efforts will typically coincide with the IWK's annual telethon or radiothon.\nThe woman who called the IWK about the incident said one person had an iPad and asked her to enter her credit card information on it.\n\"For me, that's the largest concern. It would be the capture of people's confidential credit card information. We would never endorse that,\" said LeClair.\nShe said anyone looking to make a web donation could do so through the IWK Foundation's website. In this case, the iPad wasn't on the foundation's page.\nClothing with IWK lettering LeClair said the people were wearing blue shirts, blue jackets and a blue hat.\nShe said fraudsters don't often use the IWK as a cover for their scams, but it happens periodically.\n\"Maybe once a year, we'll hear about something. The vast majority of people doing fundraising are doing it out of the kindness of their hearts and legitimately,\" said LeClair.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T08:20:25.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
