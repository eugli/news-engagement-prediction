Troy K. Venning, 40, only needed two months at Macedonia A.M.E. Church in Pearl City to make more headway than the 100-year-old church had seen in a long time. \"He's the greatest pastor, and what he did in eight weeks helped us redo the church,\" said Laura Albury, 76, a member for 70 years.\nVenning took the bills in hand and had both restrooms replaced and the pastor's study updated, Albury said. \"He showed love for all of us,\" she added.\n\"God told me to work on Macedonia before we can work on the outside,\" Venning told the congregation. \"God blessed us to wipe out some bills and ... there was some stuff in the church office from 1918,\" he joked.\nThe Rev. Jessie Harvin Jr., presiding elder, said, \"I made a recommendation and the bishop approved it. I know [Venning] from his work around the conference; we have 26 churches. ... We wanted a young pastor to fulfill the vision of the church in this community.\"\nCaption Going inside the hive for a honey harvest Broward County Beekeeper’s Association President Dan Novak takes us with him as he harvests honey from his backyard bee hives.\nBroward County Beekeeper’s Association President Dan Novak takes us with him as he harvests honey from his backyard bee hives.\nCaption Watch these wiener dogs competing for the title of fastest dachshund More than 90 wiener dogs raced each other during the 5th Dachstoberfest in West Palm Beach.

Church in Moore Haven and communications minister at St. Paul A.M.E. Church in Miami. \"It's exciting for me.\n\"This is a place where everyone is accepted. I plan to be inclusive,\" said Venning, who's also a radio personality. His \"Life After Church\" broadcast is 7 to 9 p.m. Thursdays on Strong Arm Radio at StrongArm.fm\nVenning has degrees from Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary, Xavier University and the University of Phoenix.
