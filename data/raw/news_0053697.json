Aaron and Bachalo have reenergized the good Doctor with layered allies, new and creative villains, and a reset of the status quo that mandated a big change in the Doctor's day to day operations. The result of all that tinkering is a Doctor Strange retains his psychedelic essence while also providing new readers the most approachable Doctor Strange that's been seen in some time. \nWhether you're a longtime fan or someone coming in straight from the cineplex, there's something for everyone here, so here are a few reasons you should give it a shot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:06:03.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
