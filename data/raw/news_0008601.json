The forward put the Americans on top of Jamaica, 1-0, on Friday night â€” a much-needed breakthrough after a scoreless draw against Serbia five days earlier â€” and itâ€™s his name that will go on the scoresheet, but it was the passing that set him up that was really special. There it is!ðŸŽ‰ @b_feilhaber22 and @JMoSmooth13 combine for the #USMNT 's first goal of 2017. #USAvJAM https://t.co/EoFOCQuYNp \nâ€” FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 4, 2017 \nThe Americansâ€™ sequence of one-touch passing to break down the Jamaica midfield was a work of art. And then there was Benny Feilhaberâ€™s pass to set Morris up. It looks easy, but to be in tight space like that, have the wherewithal to make the pass and then get the weight of it just right is special. Itâ€™s definitely something that the Americans often lack. \nIt may have taken the U.S. nearly 2.5 hours to find the back of the net, but they made sure it was worth the wait. And now they have the first goal of 2017 and the second Bruce Arena era.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T09:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:46:02.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
