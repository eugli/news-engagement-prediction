This was an enormous set-up.\n\"It is almost impossible to work out how many plants are inside, but we are talking thousands rather than hundreds and we would estimate the value of the crop at over £1 million.\"\nOfficers waited outside for people to leave the bunker on Wednesday night, saying the site was all but impossible to enter.\nThree men, aged 27, 30 and 45 and from Somerset, were arrested as they left the building, and officers used their keys to enter.\nInside they found several thousand cannabis plants at various stages of growth and three other males, aged 15, 19 and 37, all of no fixed address, believed to be working as gardeners.\nThe three males found inside the bunker were arrested on suspicion of cannabis production, while those held outside were arrested on suspicion of cannabis production and human trafficking offences.\nIt is not the first time large hauls of the class B drug have been found in unusual places - or even in a disused nuclear bunker.\nIn 2015 a man was jailed for two-and-a-half years for growing more than 800 cannabis plants in Drakelow Tunnels, in Worcestershire, a 285,000 sq ft network of tunnels stretching for about three miles.\nLast year, police found at least 1,000 cannabis plants at a luxury nine-bedroom country mansion in March, Cambridgeshire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:18:39.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
