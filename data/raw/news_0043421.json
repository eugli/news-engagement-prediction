Macron was on a visit to London for a rally for 200,000 French voters who live in the capital and could sweep him to power. \nSpeaking to reporters on the doorstep of Number 10, he said : \n“I was very happy to see that some academics and researchers in the UK because of Brexit are considering coming to France to work. \n“It will be part of my programme to be attractive for these kinds of people. \n“I want banks, talents, researchers, academics and so on. \n“I think that France and the European Union are a very attractive space now so in my programme I will do everything I can to make it attractive and successful.” XXSTRINGERXX / Reuters Emmanuel Macron, candidate in France's 2017 French presidential speaks to media outside 10 Downing Street.
