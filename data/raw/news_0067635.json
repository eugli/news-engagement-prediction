Story continues below \n“A lot of people agree on this middle ground where police participate but perhaps not in uniform,” Burgess said Thursday. \n“One of the things we hear is, ‘I agree with Black Lives Matter and I can recognize what they’re saying, but I think police should still be given the opportunity to participate.’ This is a way that that is realized.” \nBlack Lives Matter Vancouver asked the Vancouver Police Department last summer to voluntarily withdraw from the parade as “a show of solidarity and understanding” because the presence of uniformed officers makes some minority groups feel unsafe. \nThe request came shortly after Black Lives Matter in Toronto blocked that city’s parade until organizers agreed to demands that included barring police floats from future events. \nBesides proposing a decrease in the number of officers in the parade and asking them to march in T-shirts, Vancouver Pride Society suggested that police increase their outreach to vulnerable groups who feel unsafe participating in the parade. \nThe Vancouver Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nVancouver Coun. Tim Stevenson said the city would endorse whatever outcome is reached between the police and the pride society. He described law enforcement in Vancouver as one of the most progressive in North America. \n“I used to be on the board of the Pride Parade and I was part of those trying to get the police into the parade, encouraging them. And when they came, whoopee!” Stevenson said. \n“The police actually gave us legitimacy in a way that we hadn’t felt before. I mean, imagine having the police in the Pride Parade.” \nLast week, a group of transgender activists presented the pride society with a petition urging it to allow police into the parade with uniforms, arguing that a ban on officers could undermine the positive relationship between the LGBTQ community and law enforcement. \nPolice have taken part in Vancouver’s Pride Parade since 2002. They march as part of the city’s entry, alongside firefighters and municipal officials. \nThe parade became a civic event in 2013, meaning the city began paying the bill for public safety costs related to police presence, as well as garbage and cleanup. \nThis year’s parade is scheduled to take place in early August. \nIn a statement, the Vancouver Pride Society also said it should have more strongly condemned the online racism aimed at members of Black Lives Matter in response to the group’s advocacy work. \n“We tried to stay neutral and hold the middle ground in this conversation, and through doing that we realized after talking to Black Lives Matter that that created a space where a lot of hate and death threats and things like that have really been directed at them.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T10:36:22.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
