Hopefully, they will come forward,\" inspector-general of police Khalid Abu Bakar told Bernama when contacted. \nForeign media reported that the suspects were thought to be 'hiding' inside the embassy. \nThe suspects are still believed to be in the country. \nJong-nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, died after being attacked on Feb 13 by two women who reportedly swiped his face with what is believed to be poison. \nAfter the attack, Malaysian police detained four suspects - a woman bearing a Vietnamese passport, an Indonesian woman, a Malaysian man and a North Korean man. The Malaysian was released on police bail. \nIt was previously reported that police were tracking down seven North Korean suspects - four of whom were said to have fled Malaysia on the day Jong-nam was attacked while waiting for his flight to Macau at the KLIA2. \nJong-nam had come to Malaysia on Feb 6 and carried a passport bearing the name of Kim Chol. \nMore than 50 members of the press gathered in front of the embassy this afternoon to get comment from mission officials following Khalid's press conference and rumours that two suspects were hiding at the premises. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:57:38.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
