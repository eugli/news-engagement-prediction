He didn’t disappoint. \nDwayne “The Rock” Johnson, who first appeared in front of the Staples Center crowd before the televised portion of the show, was in Los Angeles to shoot an in-ring scene for an upcoming wrestling film called “Fighting with My Family,” which is based on the life of WWE superstar Paige. \nIt just so happens the scene involved Paige’s character wrestling former WWE superstar AJ Lee’s character. AJ Lee, of course, is married to former WWE superstar CM Punk, so the crowd’s attention shifted to Punk, and The Rock responded by pulling out his cell phone. \nThe Rock, now a movie megastar who seemingly can do pretty much whatever he wants when he returns for cameos with WWE, called CM Punk while in the middle of the ring. Punk, who went through a bad breakup with WWE before eventually landing with UFC, didn’t answer, but The Rock made the call worthwhile by leaving his former co-worker a voicemail. He even tried to FaceTime Punk. \nThe entire scene can be viewed in the videos below.
