Mostly because something actually happens in this one, and I’m a sucker for things actually happening in videos. I’m just not sure I’d have guessed that this would be the particular thing to happen. Watch A Guy Put His Car In Reverse At 70 MPH Watch A Guy Put His Car In Reverse At 70 MPH Watch A Guy Put His Car In Reverse At 70 MPH I’m all for doing idiotic experiments with cars.

I’ll admit, I’d always sort of figured if you jammed your transmission into reverse at 40 mph or so you’d hear some horrible noises, and then there’d be some kind of dramatic lurch and clunk, and then your transmission would be a jangly mass of gear slices inside the bell housing. \nI was wrong. Well, at least in the case of this Ranger and what I think is its Ford C3 transmission. Sponsored \nThere’s weird noises, sure, a more intense version of the usual reverse gear whine, but that transmission is able to spin those wheels backwards, with a lot of smoke and fury. \nReverse is a very low gear, usually lower than first, but perhaps there’s not an over-rev issue because the wheels are attempting to turn in the opposite direction? I suspect all the wheelspin and loss of grip are really what saves everything here.
