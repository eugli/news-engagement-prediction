In 2015, du fetched a total of Dh18.9 million out of the 70 numbers sold, which included the unique 052 222 2222 that went to an Emirati businessman for Dh8 million, and 052 200 0000 that was bagged by another bidder for Dh4.15 million.\nWhile the Dh8 million deal was a record for UAE, it was still behind the smashing Dh10 million sale generated in Qatar from the auction of the number in 2006.
