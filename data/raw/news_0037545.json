By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Thursday, February 16, 2017 - 23:08 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nNew Delhi: A chikoo seed had made a 50-year-old woman's trachea (windpipe) its home for 2 months before it was surgically removed. \nA resident of Wankaner in Rajkot, Shantaben Khandeka, had been complaining of severe cough for over two months. Physicians who were consulted could not put a finger on the cause even as her health showed signs of constant deterioration. \nCity-based ENT surgeon Himanshu Thakkar said, “CT-SCAN showed a foreign body stuck in her trachea which cut down supply of oxygen to her left lung.” \n\"We performed bronchoscopy on her and removed a 2-cm long chikoo seed without any complications,\" he said. \nThe procedure was performed last week. \n\"It was not easy as the patient was around 50 years old and the foreign body stuck in her trachea for over two months had to be removed quickly, otherwise the patient's health could have deteriorated further,\" Dr Thakkar said. \n\"After a couple of hours' stay at the hospital, the patient was discharged and she is now fine,\" he said. \n\"Such cases generally occur among children,\" he noted, adding that had the seed stuck in central area of trachea, she could have died on the spot. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Thursday, February 16, 2017 - 23:08 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:58:16.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
