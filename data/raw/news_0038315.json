Darrelle Revis (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:05 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 6:05 p.m. ET \nJets cornerback Darrelle Revis is under police investigation over his role in an altercation in Pittsburgh earlier this week, but there are conflicting reports about who was the aggressor. \nPittsburgh police are looking into an incident reported Monday around 2:30 a.m. involving Revis and two other men, according to WTAE-TV . The report, citing unnamed police sources, said Revis was spotted with the men by an on-duty patrol officer driving in a cruiser. When the officer returned, the two men were unconscious and Revis was no longer at the scene, according to WTAE, which added that police are considering filing felony charges against the NFL veteran. \nMORE: 40 most hated NFL players of all time: loudmouths, cheaters, criminals \nRevis' lawyer gave KDKA-TV a different account of the incident. He said Revis was \"assaulted by a group of five people\" and fled the scene because he \"feared for his safety and eventually went to get medical treatment,\" according to KDKA. \nIn a statement Thursday, the Jets acknowledged Revis' involvement in the incident but declined further comment.
