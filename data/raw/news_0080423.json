Here, Britain’s top pollster, John Curtice, analyses the extent to which Mrs May could build on this symbolic feat at the next General Election to make further inroads into Labour’s Northern heartlands. Not so long ago, Conservatives never dared look north. The Tory victory over Labour in the Copeland by-election means Theresa May has now built her own ‘Hadrian’s Wall’ in the far North of England After the 1997 General Election the party held just two seats north of Richmond in North Yorkshire, held at the time by the party’s leader, William Hague. However, the party’s capture of Copeland in the far North West – a seat it has not won since 1931 – has rattled Jeremy Corbyn’s MPs. With the Labour leader’s ratings at rock-bottom, Theresa May has as good a chance as any recent predecessor to become a ‘one nation’ Tory Prime Minister. The Conservatives won 44 of the 158 seats in the North of England at the 2015 Election.
