On the other hand, stars are using the spotlight to broadcast their resistance, starting with Meryl Streep at the Golden Globes . Photo Michael Moore, speaking out against President George W.

Many in America who are supportive of Mr. Trump already feel alienated by “Hollywood elites,” and might not be tuning in to the Oscars anyway. But as public arts funding is threatened with cuts , and Mr. Trump unveils other contentious policies, many actors suddenly feel that they must speak out , even if they’re preaching to a choir eager to lap up their every word. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Matters came to a head when the travel ban went into chaotic effect over the weekend. One Oscar contender who was immediately affected was the Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, whose drama “ The Salesman ” is up for the Academy Award for best foreign-language film. (His “A Separation” won in 2012.) Now he’s subject to the ban, which sharply limits travel from seven Muslim-majority countries. Mr. Farhadi said that even if he were granted an exemption to travel, he wouldn’t attend. “To humiliate one nation with the pretext of guarding the security of another is not a new phenomenon in history and has always laid the groundwork for the creation of future divide and enmity,” Mr. Farhadi said in a statement . He went on to condemn “the unjust conditions” the order had forced upon citizens of the seven nations. Will this affect Mr. Farhadi’s Oscar chances? You betcha. Not only has the fracas raised the visibility of his film, but it has also made voting for it a political act. The same goes for the nominated documentary short “The White Helmets,” about civilian Syrian rescuers. One of the film’s subjects and a cameraman were to attend the Oscars, according to the filmmakers , but now are shut out, too. The Iranian-born Swedish actress, Bahar Pars, a star in the Swedish entry “A Man Called Ove,” has said that she i s determined to attend as a statement but that details were still being sorted out. The ban, which the United Nations says has imperiled 20,000 refugees , also stands to raise the profile of nominated films that explore migrants’ plight, like the documentary feature “Fire at Sea” and the shorts “ Watani: My Homeland ” and The New York Times’s Op-Doc, “ 4.1 Miles .” Photo Mahershala Ali, accepting the award for outstanding performance by a male actor in a supporting role for “Moonlight.” He spoke of how he and his Christian mother overcame their differences after he converted to Islam 17 years ago. Credit Chris Pizzello/Invision, via Associated Press As widespread protests roiled airports last weekend, there were questions in Hollywood about whether speakers and winners would take aim at Mr. Trump at the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday, and the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday. Ms. Streep had already set a precedent at the Golden Globes in January: She publicly castigated Mr. Trump for being a bully. If that speech increased her chances at landing an Oscar nomination for her role in “Florence Foster Jenkins” — and Hollywood chatter holds that it totally did — Mr. Trump sealed the deal. His tweet the next day, calling her one of Hollywood’s “most overrated actresses,” fell smack in the middle of the voting window for Oscar nominations. And, lo, a few weeks later, Ms. Streep became a 20-time Oscar nominee. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
