(Getty Images) \nFormer Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink is on Leicester City’s shortlist to replace Claudio Ranieri, according to reports. \nThe Italian was sacked by Leicester on Thursday evening just nine months after guiding the club to the Premier League title. \nThe 65-year-old was told the news on Thursday afternoon, less than 24 hours after the team’s 2-1 defeat to Sevilla in the Champions League. \nLeicester, who defied odds of 5,000/1 with their title upset last year, are currently 17th in the Premier League and just a point above the relegation zone. Ranieri guided Leicester City to their first league title in 133 years. (Getty Images) Reports claim that Leicester’s players fell out with Ranieri before his exit.
