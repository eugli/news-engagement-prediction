'As opposed to which day,' he exclaimed. 'I haven't had a day off yet!' What's new? Alene was given control over the couple's date - much to Simon's bemusement - and her mind immediately turned to a makeover The couple started their date at a department store, where the 31-year-old found a number of outfits for Simon to try on. The chinos, board shorts and casual suits left the Queensland man feeling like someone 'from the big smoke', but eventually the pair found an outfit they both agreed on. Afterwards, she took Simon to the hairdresser. New look: The couple tried on a number of jazzy outfits before settling on one the Queensland man was happy with From the day they met, Alene has had an issue with her husband's curly locks, telling her bridesmaid at the couple's wedding 'he needs to lose the hair'. The 36-year-old was initially very reluctant, and suggested a trim instead, but after his wife used her best 'puppy dog eyes', literally begged and reminded him a few times they were on a surrender date, he conceded defeat. 'Alright, stuff it,' he said halfheartedly. Pretty please? It took puppy dog eyes and literal begging from his bride before Simon relented to losing his curly locks Regret: The 36-year-old immediately began to worry as his hair disappeared New man! Simon was virtually unrecognisable as he went to see his wife for the first time with his new look As his curls hit the floor, the distress on his face was obvious, but the makeover proved to be a success when he unveiled his new look to bride Alene. Sitting in what appeared to be a private room in a restaurant, the nurse told producers she was 'more nervous to see him' than on her wedding day. When he entered the room, she squealed and ran to hug him. An ear-to-ear grin swept over her face which did not leave for the rest of the night. Over the moon: Alene was delighted with the changes, and said her husband had become 'hot' 'I can't express how appreciative I am,' she said, adding her husband had become 'hot'. Simon also relented and admitted he did not mind his new look. 'It's still a bit out of my comfort zone, but it's a nice change,' he said.
