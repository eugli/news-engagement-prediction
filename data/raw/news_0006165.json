We do have some, so it’s helped.”\nAccording to the most recent available figures, the Falcons had sold 41,102 seat licenses as of mid-January, up from 33,000 at the start of the season. As of mid-January, the team appeared to have about 20,000 PSLs left to sell. (Some seats, such as those in suites or sponsor deals, are excluded from the PSL inventory.)\nFrom a business standpoint, it would be hard to imagine a better springboard into a new stadium than a Super Bowl berth, which in the Falcons’ case is just the second in the franchise’s 51-year history.\n“I think the timing is great,” Blank said Friday. “I would say Mercedes-Benz Stadium — in terms of design and construction and selling of PSLs — has been going along great. We were on pace, above pace, and I think when you have this kind of season it supports that.”\nWhile sales benefit from emotion and enthusiasm surrounding the Super Bowl — “the city is on fire,” Blank said — he thinks seat-license purchases are a reflection not only of the current season, but also of confidence about the future.\n“I think a lot of fans when they make that decision about PSLs and long-term commitments, in their mind what they’re asking is: Is this a one-year wonder or is this an organization … that is going to be a sustainably winning organization?” Blank said.\n“And that has been my longest-term goal: Not just to get to a championship game and win it — certainly that is our goal — but beyond that to have a team that (is among the) four-five teams you discuss at the very top every year. If you’re in that conversation, you’re at the party, you have a chance.”\nPSLs are one-time fees for the right to buy season tickets annually over the next 30 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:53:46.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
