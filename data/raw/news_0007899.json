That was five years ago and lifeguard Anthony Glick, 22, who is one of the stars in hit TV show Bondi Rescue, has been obsessed with capturing the perfect picture ever since, combining his love for the sun and surf with his passion for photography. Now he is exhibiting his stunning images, selling prints all over the world and constantly adding to his collection of lenses, cameras and other professional gear. Bondi Rescue's Anthony Glick and girlfriend Megan Hosiosky - Anthony is a self-taught photographer and is now showing his work in a solo exhibition Glick, originally from Johannesburg in South Africa, told Daily Mail Australia he 'takes photographs every day', spending hours before and after his day job to create his works. 'I wake up before sunrise so I can get to the beach to capture it,' he said. 'I have learnt consistency is very important with photography - if you go to the beach every day you will be there when something amazing happens. 'You will be able to catch the perfect sunrise - or the moment a dolphin breaches in front of a whale. 'And if you stay in bed you will be wondering what it is you're missing.' It wasn't until Glick set up an Instagram account to share his photos that he realised how his love for the beach was shared with so many - and decided to upgrade his camera gear 'to the very best'. 'I started with the iPhone, then I moved on to my dad's camera - but he wanted that back after a while so I bought my own little semi-profession gear. 'Now I only shoot with the best equipment - when you have the lighting right, and the timing right it is important to back yourself and invest in yourself and use a camera of the best quality.' What started as a hobby is now a full-blown passion and business for the young lifesaver. 'I feel like I am living the dream - I have both of my dream jobs and my perseverance has paid off.' HAPPY PEOPLE - 'Ever since I began photography, the beach and the people enjoying it has inspired me. The photo of Bondi Beach captures a moment that epitomises a busy summer day. It looks amazing as you can study the details for hours and it basically feels like you can walk straight into it' What started as a hobby is now a full-blown passion and business for the young lifesaver who spends 'most of his life' at the beach The 22-year-old moved to the eastern suburbs 15 years ago - after growing up in a compound in South Africa ICON - 'Believe it or not, I have never done the Sydney Harbour Bridge climb, and have always wanted to do it. In this photo I focused on the two main icons - the bridge and the Opera House - and the connection of the tourists between the two. I aimed to give scale and reverence to the two landmarks by comparing the group of twelve bridge walkers to their presence and stature' Glick, who is represented by international art dealer Margot de Manning, has more than 18,000 followers on Instagram. 'People would see a photo they love and send me a message on Instagram asking if I could make them a print,' he said. 'Now I package things up with my production team at Creative Frames in Waterloo and I send them everywhere from Bondi to the UK. It is a good feeling knowing that someone in London, who was a stranger now has a connection to me through my art and has one of my photographs of the beach hanging on their wall.' The lifesaver spent his young years confined to the family compound in Johannesburg, yearning for the annual family trip to the beach. 'As soon as we go home from the holiday I would get excited to go again,' he said. But 15 years ago his family swapped life in the bustling, dangerous city for Sydney's eastern suburbs. 'Suddenly I had the beach at my doorstep, I felt like I really belonged.' PRIMARY COLOURS - 'Using a big zoom lens from a helicopter, I focused on the surfer below and their red and blue boards. I really love how the colours pop in this shot' Glick hanging his photographs for his exhibition - the images are printed on metallic paper to 'make them pop' SPECKLED - 'I love photographing big crowds at the beach and this day at Bondi was one of the busiest. I really like how the people are doing loads of different things in this photograph. People are running, sleeping, playing ball games, taking photos or just strolling on the sand banks at low tide' Now he describes the famous Australian beach and his office, his playground and his backyard. 'I am here before sunrise to take photographs, then I work here all day and take photographs or exercise or surf in the evening. 'I go home and go to sleep and then I come back again.' The photographer says being part of Bondi's well-known surf lifesaving team has helped with his following and with the quality of his images. 'People will come up to me on the beach and tell me they follow me on social media and that they love my photos - which is really good for my confidence. 'Some of the lifesavers here have even bought my photos which is a huge compliment because they know this area better than anyone.' SYDNEY SAILS - 'This photo was taken in late December 2016 when the Opera House was actually packed with tourists. I took the shot while hovering above in a helicopter in order to get a unique perspective and the rare moment when there's no people in view' EIGHT LANES - 'This is a Thursday morning at Bondi Icebergs while it is being cleaned. In my photograph you can see the eight lane numbers reflected in the shallow water and that is my favourite imagery discreetly captured by the camera' His knowledge of the eastern suburbs beaches, especially Bondi, means he always knows the best locations to take a great photo. When Glick has slumps in enthusiasm, or his work starts to plateau, he tries to do something new and exciting or push boundaries in a new way. During one of these periods the young lifesaver decided to hop in a helicopter and take a photograph of the beach from above. Two of his favourite images 'Happy People' and 'Primary Colours' came from this shoot - and feature in his current exhibition. 'Happy People is my favourite photo, it is bright and colourful and the detail is amazing. You can see the sand, people running and laughing and enjoying their day at the beach.' Glick considers the eastern suburb beaches as his office, playground and gym. He loves surfing and his job as a life guard WAIT - 'I took this shot on a cool spring morning. The ocean was flat with only a few tiny waves coming through. I wanted to capture the calm and moment of anticipation from the surfer waiting for a good wave' The second photograph has been edited for effect and shows surfers from above - the picture is black and white except for the surfboards which are bright blue and red. 'Everybody does some editing, when people say \"but it is photo shopped\" I don't care because it is part of the art for this piece.' The exhibition features Glick's favourite pieces - as well as the photographs his audience enjoy most. 'Seeing them on paper is incredible, it is much more special than scrolling through them on an Instagram feed,' he said. WHAT ARE ANTHONY GLICK'S PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS? Trial and error is key - The best way to learn is by just missing out on a great shot. I have missed some of the most amazing pictures because the colour has blown out or it is over-exposed but you just have to keep trying until you get it right. Invest in yourself - the better your camera and lenses the better your photographs will be. Once you have the lighting and moment right it comes down to the camera. I still invest in myself all the time - buying new lenses or cameras. Stay consistent - I go to the beach every morning at sunrise. If I don't I could miss out on the best shot. Do your own thing - So many people take photos now but if you stick to your own thing and do it well people will start to follow your work. Plateau's happen, reignite your passion - Sometimes we all lack that motivation to get out of bed and take the photo. When this happens I like to do something different, go somewhere different or try new things. Last time I hired a helicopter and took photos of the beach from above. BLACK & BLUE - 'I took this shot on a sunny Friday morning in spring - the day after the iconic Icebergs pool was cleaned. I really like the contrast of the black and sky blues - and the dramatic stark architecture' The Bondi Beach Series Photography exhibition will be featured in the lobby of the five-star Four Seasons Hotel Sydney with Ultimate Art. The exhibition runs until Sunday, March 12 2017, which is curated by Margo de Manning.
