It was there that Michael Cole put together the group to own a gelding he had been given in return for looking after two fillies for three years by the stud that bred them. Cole said: 'I was down the pub and I said I couldn't afford to have him in training, so we got a few together. They pay half and I pay half. The seven-year-old is owned by a syndicate of 17 regulars at a Pembrokeshire pub 'Most of them had nothing to do with racing to start with. They can't seem to lose now and they keep lumping on. Someone asked me if I would sell him but I'd get lynched if I did. I'm some sort of god now . . . until he loses!' Tobefair has not done that for a while. His winning spree started with two successes at Worcester in the summer of 2015 and victory at Chepstow before he missed a year with injury. A comeback win at Ffos Las in November was followed by success at Chepstow in December and the win at Warwick in January that qualified Tobefair for the Festival Final. Victory at Newbury this month ensured his place in the Cheltenham starting line-up. But it has not all been plain sailing. Tobefair, originally trained by Lucy Jones before she retired, finished second on his debut in July 2014 but then was beaten almost out of sight in five subsequent runs. Syndicate leader Cole said: 'This is all quite nerve-racking but it was worse back then. I was worried for the people I had brought in and taken a share in him. Tobefair will be a first Festival runner for Welsh trainer Debra Hamer and her husband Paul 'The first time he won at Worcester I was standing by one of the syndicate and he said, 'He's consistent. He's always at the back'. With that, Whelan gave him a couple of cracks and he took off. The Coral and Betfred down here have had a hammering. When he won at Warwick, they had to borrow £20,000 from Coral Carmarthen branch for the Pembrokeshire branch to pay out.' Hamer, whose husband was a top point-to-point rider, said they soon saw potential in Tobefair, 'a big lump of a horse' who has started to mature. She said: 'He was laid-back and we could soon see there was more to him than he was showing. 'We had to dig a bit deeper and it came out. He deserves to be at Cheltenham and I will be proud of him.' Cole, who last went to the Festival in the Eighties, admitted to growing nerves. 'I'll be awake half the night,' he said. 'If he can finish in the first six, I'll think we've had a good run. 'They may quicken away from him as they run down the hill but if he can stays close to the leaders, I don't think he will be far off.'
