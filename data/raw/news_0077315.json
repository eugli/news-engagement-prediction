While a few places in the south may begin to get rainfall from Tuesday, north Tamil Nadu and Puducherry too may receive some rain from Thursday. \nHowever, Chennai, currently reeling under a near water-starvation situation, may not actually benefit much from this rain spell. The weather system may bring down the day temperature this week. On Monday, the weather observatories in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam recorded a maximum temperature of 31 degree Celsius and 31.2 degree Celsius, which was close to normal temperature. \nWeather bloggers and meteorology enthusiasts note that this rain spell would bring considerable rains over the State. Pradeep John, who runs the popular Facebook page ‘Tamil Nadu Weatherman’, said the southern and western parts of the State may get moderate to heavy showers. This weather system may provide significant rainfall, exceeding the normal rainfall of 20 mm in March. He pointed out that Tamil Nadu got 170 mm of rainfall in March 2008 and 55 mm in March 2006. \nChennai will continue to experience warm nights due to higher moisture content in the atmosphere, he said. \nCiting IMD data since 1951, K. Srikanth who blogs at Chennaiyil Oru Mazhaikalam said the State has received excess rainfall for 21 years in March. “This means Tamil Nadu has been getting more than 20 mm of rains in March once in three years. This March, a few places may experience heavy showers too,” he said. \nChennai too has registered a good rainfall of 138 mm in March 2008. This is much more than its average of 4 mm in March. However, this rain spell may bring only sporadic light showers, without any benefit or amelioration of the water situation in the city, he added.
