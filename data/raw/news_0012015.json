Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA horrified mum is warning parents of the dangers of social media, after her teenage son was offered £500 for his “dirty boxers” on Facebook. \nThe boy, who is under 15 and isn’t being named, was befriended by a man called John Humphrey on the networking site when he started asking if the teen “likes boys”. \nHe then went on to ask him for his “dirty” underwear in exchange for £500. \nThe young lad told his sickened mum, who deleted the man from his account and contacted police and the boy's school, Winifred Holtby Academy in Kingswood, Humberside. \nHis mum told the Hull Daily Mail : \"My son got a message from this man and another of his friends also received a similar message. A few of them seem to be friends with this person. The messages sent by the older man to the teenage boy (Photo: SWNS) \n\"The man has a growing list of friends and they all seem to be boys. I've reported it to Facebook. We have also reported it to the police and the school. \n\"My son told me after the man started messaging him. He was sensible enough to tell me rather than just laugh it off. \n\"Some boys are quite naïve when it comes to this sort of thing.\" \nThe man involved appears to be 43 years old and living in America. He has more than 500 friends on Facebook, most of whom appear to be quite young. \nThe Mail contacted him via Messenger but, after initially acknowledging the messages, he didn't respond after being asked to explain his actions. \nThe boy's mum said: \"My son was shocked by what happened and it is a reminder of what the likes of Facebook can be like. \n\"I am hoping more people report him as there is a better chance further action will be taken.

You never think it will happen to your children. It is horrible. \n\"I just deleted him straight away but I wish I hadn't acted so quickly and tried to find out more about him. The thought of him having any of my son's photos made me sick. \n\"My son knows the dangers but I will be monitoring his computer use more closely. I don't think you can stop young people from using social media but you just have to be more careful. \n\"I just want other parents to be aware of what can happen when their children are online.\" \nHumberside Police confirmed they had received a complaint but are not taking the matter further at this stage. \nA spokesman said: \"We have spoken to the parent of a boy who has allegedly received inappropriate messages via Facebook. \n\"After careful consideration of the circumstances, appropriate advice has been given and the details have been noted.\" Read More \nThe incident happened ahead of today's Safer Internet Day which is a worldwide event which tries to help parents and children protect themselves online. \nThe boy attends Winifred Holtby Academy and the school has warned other parents. \nA spokeswoman said: \"We have robust safeguarding procedures in place and we have an e-safety policy and provide regular lessons around safety online. \n\"In light of what has happened, we are sending out a message to parents to remind them of the issues around online safety.\" \nVisit getsafeonline.org for further advice on children using social networking sites.
