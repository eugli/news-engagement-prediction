Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFamilies with exploding tumble dryers in their homes have been told to unplug them immediately in a dramatic u-turn by manufacturer Whirlpool . \nThe electricals giant caved in to pressure and admitted all affected models including Hotpoint and Indesit dryers should be taken out of service until they can be repaired. \nIt comes after the Mirror led calls for Whirlpool to take responsibility for 5.3 million dangerous machines sold over a decade and linked to hundreds of fires. \nCampaigners are now demanding customers with unable to use dryers while waiting months for a repair be compensated. \nSince admitting the fault in November 2015 the company had defiantly insisted they were safe to use so long as they were not left unattended. \nIt faced a barrage of demands to order them to be taken out of use including from firefighters, consumer group Which? and Electrical Safety First. \nThe Mirror has led the way in exposing the exploding tumble dryer and holding Whirlpool to account culminating in the issue being debated in Parliament. \nWhich? Has now joined the Mirror’s call for a full product recall and free replacement of all faulty machines.

Whirlpool has updated the advice on its website (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nOther brands affected by the fault which sees excess fluff catch fire are Creda, Swan and Proline. \nWhirlpool confirmed the dramatic u-turn yesterday(Wed) in updated advice on its website. \nIt states: “If your tumble dryer is affected by this issue then you should unplug it and do not use it until the modification has taken place.” \nJill Paterson, of Leigh Day solicitors representing victims of tumble dryer fires, said: “Thousands of consumers are now left with a product that they can’t use and are enforced to wait for Whirlpool to get round to carrying out the modification. \n“This can’t be right. I would call on Whirlpool to rectify this situation by offering compensation or a free replacement machine to all those affected as soon as possible.” \nFamilies have been left waiting months with the potential death traps in their homes after Whirlpool refused to initiate a full product recall and replace all machines.

Recalled Whirlpool tumble dryer (Photo: hotpoint) \n“Fundamentally we now believe a full recall is necessary and the Government must urgently address the issues with the product safety system as it shouldn’t require the threat of judicial review to ensure that consumers are protected from dangerous products. \n“Despite updating the safety notice on its websites, Whirlpool still needs to do a lot more. \n“Our advice is to go straight to Whirlpool to demand your machine is fixed but also try speaking to the retailer you bought it from.” \nFaulty models sold between 2004 and 2015 have been linked to hundreds of fires and at least two deaths. \nDoug McTavish, 39, and Bernard Hender, 19, died in ablaze at their home in Conwy, North Wales, in October 2014. \nLondon Fire Brigade investigators found that a serious blaze that ripped through an 18-storey tower block in Shepherd’s Bush last August was caused by a faulty Indesit tumble dryer which required a repair. \nAssistant Commissioner for Fire Safety Dan Daly said: “This change of advice could save lives and we are extremely relieved that, after six months of campaigning by the Brigade, Whirlpool has finally brought its advice in line with our own.

It said 1.3 million of these cases have been resolved. \nIt said in a statement: “Trading Standards confirmed, following an internal review by independent experts, that the modification programme remains the most effective way of resolving this issue. “Since the launch of this campaign, safety has been our number one priority. We have consistently responded to the advice of Trading Standards and continue to do so. \n“Trading standards have now notified us that updated usage advice should be communicated to consumers and we are implementing this. \n“Trading standards have confirmed that our actions to date in this campaign have been undertaken diligently and responsibly. \n“The success of this programme depends on as many customers as possible registering with us for a modification.” \nThe five faulty brand models are now owned by Whirlpool. Whirlpool branded tumble dryers are not affected.
