This only compounded the shock from Shemar Moore’s sudden departure near the end of season 11. \nMatthew Gray Gubler stepped up powerfully to shoulder great performances, as Dr. Spencer Reid. Gubler is a tremendously popular, talented and handsome young heartthrob. If anything could possibly offset the loss of Thomas Gibson and Shemar Moore on Criminal Minds it would be Matthew Gray Gubler. \nMatthew Gray Gubler was awarded by TVLine for his performance last week, as his character, Spencer Reid stands accused of Murder. It was a strange twist of fate, but now Spencer is looking at interrogation from the other side of the desk in tonight’s episode. \nSadly even Matthew Gray Gubler cannot fill in the void left by his two male co-stars, Thomas Gibson and Shemar Moore, who also served as the masculine eye candy for Criminal Minds. Sadly, the average total viewers for season 12 of Criminal Minds were only 7.623 million viewers, and only 1.43 million young adult viewers 18 – 49 years-old, according to TV Series Finale. \nCriminal Minds season 11 with Thomas Gibson, and Shemar Moore as well as Matthew Gray Gubler, A.J. Cook, Joe Mantegna, and Kirsten Vangsness averaged 9.011 million viewers per episode including 2.15 million young adults, according to TV Series Finale. \nCriminal Minds has brought back Paget Brewster, and added Aisha Tyler, Adam Rodriguez, and Damon Gupton in an attempt to fill the void left by Thomas Gibson and Shemar Moore, as agents Aaron Hotchner and Derek Morgan.

Criminal Minds is featuring a Matthew Gray Gubler story arc that will likely spread to the end of the season. \nThomas Gibson and Shemar Moore are sorely missed, as fans continue to protest Thomas Gibson’s firing from Criminal Minds. Massive protests continue to be held on Twitter at #NoHotchNoWatch, and so many other related hashtags. \nStill, Criminal Minds ratings are very low compared to previous seasons, and February 8 hit an all time low at 6.700 million and 1.17 million for the 18 to 49 age demographic. Last week on February 15, ratings regrouped a little with 1.27 million young adults and 7.340 million total viewers for a highly publicized and almost guaranteed thriller featuring Matthew Gray Gubler.

Sadly certain casting decisions do seem to be the most likely factor killing their ratings. \nCriminal Minds is playing one of its best cards left with Matthew Gray Gubler. Gubler is handsome, young and one of the finest actors working today, yet with fans angry, hurt and frustrated there is a limit to what even Matthew Gray Gubler can do to attract viewers. \nRELATED REPORTS FROM THE INQUISITR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:10:16.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
