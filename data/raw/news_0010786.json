Fox Globe Staff and Globe Correspondent February 05, 2017\nThe mood throughout Boston turned grim as the Atlanta Falcons took a commanding lead Sunday night in Super Bowl LI, with fans’ initial excitement giving way to exasperation and mounting disbelief.\nSome watched the game with their hands covering their mouths, especially after an interception late in the second quarter put the Falcons up an astonishing 21-0. A field goal by the Patriots shortly before halftime did little to ease fears.\nAdvertisement\nAt the Cask ‘n’ Flagon in the Fenway, where a line of about 50 people stretched around the corner more than an hour before kickoff, Alex Eliades remained confident after the Falcons scored their first touchdown.\nAfter their second, as the clock ticked down to halftime with the Patriots still scoreless, he started to worry.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Before the game began, he said he was “feeling confident.”\n“I think our defense will be able to hold ‘em enough,” he said, “and our offense will be able to get up enough points to get us the win.”\nAt the Fours Restaurant & Sports Bar on Canal Street, Katie Langhammer, 24, began to lose her optimism.\n“I’m trying to be a good Patriots fan, but I’m feeling doubtful,” she said.\nAcross from her, Caitlin Murphy, 23, of Brookline, seemed to be in shock.\n“I really wasn’t expecting this,” she said. “I didn’t say that before the game, but by halftime I thought we would all be happy.”\nBefore the game, Alexander Einarsson, 26, said how he had just arrived in Boston from Iceland for a job interview. It was a lucky coincidence, he said.\n“I’ve been a Patriots fan for years,” said Einarsson, 26. “This couldn’t be better.”\nNearby, David Koppel, 27, and his friends cheered as the Patriots took the field. Any time Tom Brady appeared on TV, they broke out into hoots and hollers.\nTwo years ago, he and his friends sat at the same table for the Super Bowl against the Seahawks.\n“I’m wearing the same thing I wore two years ago,” Koppel said. “Same socks, same jersey, same place.”\nAround the Cask ‘n’ Flagon, pitchers of beer flowed and friends clinked glasses in celebratory toasts. Exuberant fans clad in Patriots gear sang along with familiar tunes. Jerseys and red-white-and-blue knit hats were everywhere, and at least one man had applied eye black to his cheeks.\nThe crowd was ethnically diverse. The fans included men and women barely old enough to enter a bar and those mature enough to be their parents.\nKeith Bedford/Globe Staff\nNew England Patriots fan Marty Maxwell smiled as he watches pre-game programing for Super Bowl LI in Boston.\nAt the bar, 39-year-old Marty Maxwell, who wore a blazer emblazoned with a pattern of Patriots logos, wasn’t willing to forecast the game’s outcome.\n“I don’t want to say anything,” Maxwell insisted. “I’m hoping I spent my money well and I came up here for a grand celebration.”\nMaxwell, a native of Bar Harbor, Maine, had flown up for the day from his home in Key Largo, Fla. He said he’d done the same two weeks ago for the AFC championship game.\n“I wanted to watch the game with Pats fans,” he explained.\nAs the game began, every neck in the bar was craned to see the screens, their eyes filled with hope and anxiety. Every caught pass and interception provoked a loud response, or a hail of high-fives.\nAs the Super Bowl entered halftime, fans inside the Cask ‘n’ Flagon wore expressions of worry and frustration, but they still clung to hope.\nSullivan spent the final moments of the second quarter shouting at the TV screen before him, as his beloved Patriots continued to squander opportunities.\n“It’s annoying,” he said. “They played so well all year, and then the biggest game, they don’t.”\nStill, Sullivan believed Tom Brady could save the day.\n“The greatest quarterback of all time is capable of making the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history,” he said. “If anybody can do it, he can.”\nKeith Bedford/Globe Staff\nNew England Patriots fans Mike White(, Rich Sullivan and Liana Andrade cheered as they watched the first quarter.\nRelated Elton John plays at Robert Kraft’s private Super Bowl party Patriots will settle the score once and for all Super Bowl ads aim to unite at a divisive time for the US\nDavid Abel can be reached at dabel@globe.com .
