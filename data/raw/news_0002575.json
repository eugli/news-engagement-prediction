As they get older, their wages start to fall and they also fear losing their jobs (retirement study commissioned by the Ministry of Manpower). \nThey see no “hope” in their lifestyle in the future, as the cost of living keeps rising (most expensive city in the world, The Economist). \nThey see no “hope” in growing their assets in the future, as their bank deposits (savings 0.1 per cent, fixed deposits 1 per cent), CPF interest (2.5 per cent on the Ordinary Account), bonds (Singapore Savings Bonds less than 2.5 per cent even if you keep it for the full 10 years), stock market (almost zero return on the STI last decade), etc, are and have been among the lowest in the world. \nThey see no hope in acquiring big ticket items like a house or a car, as their net disposable income makes these unaffordable and beyond their reach (estimated about a quarter of workers earn less than half the median income). \nLeong Sze Hian Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
