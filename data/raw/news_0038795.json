The Hazard Team boss has arrived & gets directions to chemical incident at Bristol Uni — Tristan Cork BPost (@TristanCorkPost) February 3, 2017 \nH e said: \"Following a full investigation, we can confirm that the chemical, triacetone triperoxide (TATP), was unintentionally formed during a routine procedure carried out by a PhD student. \n\"The student was following a published literature method and the risk of TATP as a potential by-product had been identified during the risk assessment process. \n\"We have robust contingency plans in place to deal with incidents of this nature.\" Royal Logistics Corps Bomb Disposal have arrived at uni of Bristol chemical incident — Tristan Cork BPost (@TristanCorkPost) February 3, 2017 \nT he spokesman added: \"As soon as the presence of TATP was identified the student immediately notified those responsible for laboratory safety in the school. \n\"A series of actions were then taken which resulted in the precautionary evacuation of the chemistry building and surrounding buildings and the controlled disposal of the substance by the emergency services. No one was injured.\" \nThe chemistry department's risk assessment process is now being reviewed to see if additional checks can be made when similar work is planned in future, the spokesman added.
