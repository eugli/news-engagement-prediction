Is that the kind of strength that you're looking for?\" his co-host Kate Boldaun said of America's new President. \nMany Americans are familiar with the close relationship between the United States and Australia and some seem baffled at what is playing out. \nOne concerned US citizen called the Washington DC bureau early this morning to apologise for Mr Trump's behaviour, saying he was embarrassed and irate. \nOverhearing an ABC reporter's Australian accent during a live television cross outside the White House, several Americans also took the time to stress they don't agree with their commander-in-chief and offered commiserations. \nOn Capitol Hill, members of Congress were at pains to give reassurance that the US-Australia relationship was not under threat. \n\"I don't think Australia should be worried about its relationship with our new President, or our country for that matter,\" Republican House Majority Leader Paul Ryan told the ABC. \n\"I know your country well, I've met with your leaders continuously over the last number of years. So, no, Australia is a very important essential ally and it's going to continue to be,\" he said. \nSenator John McCain called Australia's Ambassador to the US, Joe Hockey, to reaffirm the friendship.
