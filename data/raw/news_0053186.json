The Department claimed last year that homelessness had been more than halved since 2003.\nHowever, this claim was found to gloss over the fact that this was only the case under a narrow definition of homelessness; to include only those who authorities are obliged to help. The number did not take into account homeless people who were given assistance under other schemes.\nRead more MPs say housing benefit is being wrongly stripped from jobseekers Homeless man seen fist pumping for joy after being offered a job This dry cleaners is offering free service for the homeless 'Thank you for helping create the Centrepoint Helpline' It is thought that those who meet the statutory definition of homelessness has decreased since 2003 due to councils receiving additional funding and powers to intervene and assist, but the overall number of people who face homelessness has not dropped.\nLiberal Democrat peer Baroness Grender submitted a formal complaint to the UK Statistics Authority about the use of the figures in this way.\nIn a letter responding to her concerns, the UKSA’s director general Ed Humpherson said he agreed with her complaint. He described the Department’s use of the figures as “disappointing” and they were “potentially misleading” to the public.\nMr Humpherson also stated that he will now seek a commitment from Department staff that they will give “greater clarity” on data usage in the future.\nUK news in pictures 25 show all UK news in pictures 1/25 21 February 2017 Activists who have chained themselves to vehicle and blockaded the main tunnel into Heathrow Airport as they call for no new runways\nRising Up!/PA Wire\n2/25 21 February 2017 Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan pose for a photograph outside the Royal Courts of Justice in central London\nReuters\n3/25 21 February 2017 Police man a barrier on Graham Street near where specialist officers continue excavation work at two properties on Broad Street, Swindon, where double murderer Christopher Halliwell lived\nAndrew Matthews/PA Wire\n4/25 20 February 2017 A protester holds a placard near the Houses of Parliament as an anti-Trump protest gets underway in London, as parliament debates whether or not to allow Donald Trump a state visit\nGetty Images\n5/25 20 February 2017 A protester at an anti-Trump protest near the Houses of Parliament in London, as parliament debates whether or not to allow Donald Trump a state visit\nGetty Images\n6/25 20 February 2017 Former Labour MP Tristram Hunt at the V&A in London on his first day as director of the museum\nPA wire\n7/25 20 February 2017 Satirical artist Kaya Mar during a Flag Mobí in Parliament Square, central London, as part of One Day Without Us, a national day of action in support of migrants\nPA wire\n8/25 20 February 2017 Participants take part in a Flag Mobí in Parliament Square, central London, as part of One Day Without Us, a national day of action in support of migrants\nPA\n9/25 19 February 2017 Graffiti by artist Bambi in Islington portraying PM Theresa May and US President Donald Trump in 'Lie Lie Land'\nRex\n10/25 19 February 2017 Models wear creations by designer Pam Hogg during a presentation at the Fashion Scout venue, during London Fashion Week in London, England\nGetty Images\n11/25 19 February 2017 A guest works her way through the crowds following a presentation by designer Pam Hogg at the Fashion Scout venue, during London Fashion Week in London, England\nGetty Images\n12/25 18 February 2017 Models are prepared by the hair and make-up teams backstage, ahead of a presentation by designer Julien Macdonald, during London Fashion Week in London, England\nGetty Images\n13/25 14 February 2017 The sun rises behind Tower Bridge in London\nPA wire\n14/25 14 February 2017 Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge visit to RAF base, Cambridgeshire, UK\nRex\n15/25 14 February 2017 Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge visit to RAF base, Cambridgeshire, UK\nRex\n16/25 14 February 2017 The Duchess of Cornwall, President of the Royal Voluntary Service, is given roses by RVS volunteer Dave Hancock at a tea party and swing dance at The Trinity Centre in Bristol\nPA wire\n17/25 14 February 2017 The Duchess of Cornwall, President of the Royal Voluntary Service, dances with Graeme Puckett of Hoppin' Mad at a tea party and swing dance at The Trinity Centre in Bristol\nPA wire\n18/25 14 February 2017 The scene outside Topshop in the Oracle shopping centre in Reading, Berkshire, where according to reports a 10-year-old boy died from severe head injuries following an incident involving shop furniture\nPA wire\n19/25 14 February 2017 Creator Nick Ryan examines Machine 9, an electromechanical sound instrument that transforms the movement of 27,000 pieces of space junk into sound in real time, is put on display at the Science Museum in London\nPA wire\n20/25 14 February 2017 Creator Nick Ryan examines Machine 9, an electromechanical sound instrument that transforms the movement of 27,000 pieces of space junk into sound in real time, is put on display at the Science Museum in London\nPA wire\n21/25 14 February 2017 Mayor of London Sadiq Khan poses for a photograph with Tinie Tempah and MTV presenter Laura Whitmore at the offices of Viacom in London where he announced that the MTV European Music Awards will be held in the city\nPA wire\n22/25 14 February 2017 The Tornado locomotive at Appleby station before it pulls the first timetabled main line steam-hauled service for half a century across the Ribblehead viaduct in North Yorkshire\nPA wire\n23/25 14 February 2017 Britain's Queen Elizabeth arrives to officially open the National Cyber Security Centre in London, Britain,\nReuters\n24/25 14 February 2017 The new National Cyber Crime Security centre in Victoria, central London.
