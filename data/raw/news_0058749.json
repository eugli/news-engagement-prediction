(Reuters: Joshua Roberts) \nAnd while many around the world protest against Mr Trump's policies, like his travel ban, these young conservatives are thrilled. \n\"I mean he said that he would crack down on immigration, he's done that. He said that he was going to try to repeal Obamacare, he's done that. He said that he was going to try to renegotiate the trade deals, he's done that. And I'm just proud,\" Ajua said. \n\"Our country has gone downhill over the last eight years and I feel better being an American,\" she said. \nAdriana Conradson is also pleased with the administration. \n\"Yes I'm very proud, I'm excited to see his cabinet come together, very soon but I think he's done a great job so far,\" she said. \nThe young conservatives said the conference had left them energized and ready to return home to promote Mr Trump's policies. \nSimilar meetings of Mr Trump's opponents are taking place right across the country and the protests and division look sure to continue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:43:15.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
