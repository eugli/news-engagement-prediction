She said she often thought things would have been easier if she had never won.\nMs Park, now 21, argued 18 should be the minimum age for winning the lottery and suggested the current limit of 16 was far too young.\nShe said she had become bored of relentless consumption and felt like it failed to offered long-term genuine happiness. Before winning the lottery, Ms Park, who now owns two properties, worked as an admin temp for £8 an hour and lived in a small flat with her mum in Edinburgh in Scotland.\n“I thought it would make it ten times better but it’s made it ten times worse. I wish I had no money most days. I say to myself, ‘My life would be so much easier if I hadn’t won’,” she told Sunday People .\n“People look at me and think, ‘I wish I had her lifestyle, I wish I had her money.’ But they don’t realise the extent of my stress. I have material things but apart from that my life is empty. What is my purpose in life?”\nCambridgeshire couple win £101m lottery prize 1 show all Cambridgeshire couple win £101m lottery prize 1/1 PA\n“I think 18 should be the minimum age for winning the ¬lottery, at the least. The current age of 16 is far too young.”\nDespite the fact, Camelot, who run EuroMillions in the UK, appointed an adviser to help Ms Park deal with her newly accumulated wealth, she said it was family advice which helped her keep her spending in check.\n“I’ve read about other lottery winners who’ve just blown it all and I can totally see how it can be done,” she explained. “I was stuck in front of a financial adviser who was using words like investment bonds. I had no clue what they meant.”\nMs Park said it was unsettling how differently her life had turned out from her friends, making her feel isolated.\n“It’s scary how different my life is from my friends’. When they say they’re stressed about the money they mean their wages are s**t,” she said. “There’s no one in the same boat as me, no-one who really understands. I feel like I’m a 40-year-old.”\nWhile most who play the lottery fantasise about the moment of winning the jackpot, the reality of winning can be more complicated. There are numerous stories of lottery winners who have struggled to get used to quitting their jobs and becoming rich overnight. \nCallie Rogers, who was 16 and earning £3.60 an hour when she won a National Lottery jackpot worth £1,875,000 in 2003, struggled to adjust to her newfound wealth. She went on a spending spree and is reported to have tried to kill herself. \nA spokesperson for Camelot told The Independent: \"Camelot takes its duty of care to winners very seriously and all major winners are offered support and advice for as long as they wish. That support is tailored to each winner's situation and circumstances – and for younger winners, their age will obviously be an important factor in the advice and support offered. \n“Following her win, Jane received extensive support from Camelot. A dedicated winners’ advisor visited Jane at home to pay out her prize, arrange private banking and support her through the publicity when she chose to share news of her win. An independent financial and legal panel was set up shortly after her win and we put Jane in touch with another winner who won at the same age, to share their experience and help Jane adjust to the win.\n\"We keep in contact with all major winners for as long as they wish and have been in touch with Jane from time to time since her win to offer ongoing support. Of course, it is always up to the winners themselves as to whether they want to take us up that ongoing support and advice – but the door is always open and we will continue to support Jane in any way we can if that is what decides she wants.\"\nCamelot said the minimum age limit to play the lottery is an issue for parliament to deal with which they have no control over.\n\"Anyone over the age of 16 can play the lottery, and therefore win a prize,\" they said in a statement. \"Camelot doesn’t set the age limit to play – this was agreed at the launch of the National Lottery back in 1994 and so any questions about the legal age to play would be a matter for Parliament.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T18:22:49.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
