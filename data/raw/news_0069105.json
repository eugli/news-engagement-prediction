They allow officials to suspend a ride-sharing company for up to a month after three or more instances of their drivers getting caught without a proper license or insurance. The drivers themselves face fines and jail.\nIn the case of Airbnb, officials will have the right to force their way into homes to check whether residents were renting them out illegally, adding teeth to a rarely enforced law which bans the renting out of private property for less than six months.\nHIGH GROWTH MARKET, HURDLES\nThe sharing economy business is billed for explosive growth, estimated by PricewaterhouseCoopers to reach $335 billion by 2025, from around $15 billion in 2016.\nSo there’s a lot at stake for companies. And the worry, says Adrian Lee, who runs a car-sharing service called Tribecar in Singapore, is that other markets might ape the city state's stance.\n“I'm afraid other legislators may take a leaf from our play book without allowing these services to get to critical mass.\"\nSingapore had been one of the few bright spots in Asia for Uber, which has been facing legal scrutiny in many markets across the region. Uber has suspended its service in Taiwan and has withdrawn from China after selling its business there. And in South Korea and Japan, authorities have limited its operations.\nJean Chia, a Singapore-based academic who studies the sharing economy, says since short-term renters \"were previously operating in a gray area\", the tighter regulations raise some immediate questions around the business model of Airbnb.\nAirbnb's director of public policy in Asia Pacific, Mike Orgill, echoed those concerns, saying there are “thousands of people earning supplemental income … so the lack of clarity is of concern for hosts.\"\nDrivers of Uber and Grab said a requirement for all drivers to obtain a vocational license would force out a lot of part-time drivers, while the threat of fines and even jail would deter others.\nThere is no comparable measure in \"the more than 450 cities we operate in,\" Uber's Singapore general manager Warren Tseng said of the rule change, warning it would affect tens of thousands of drivers and \"hundreds of thousands of commuters.\"\nUber's strong regional rival Grab, which is planning to invest $700 million in Indonesia, one of Asia's biggest markets, is more sanguine about the new laws.\nGrab's country head Kell Jay Lim said though the company expects some drop-off after the regulations kick in, the rules showed that Singapore was now absorbing the sharing economy into the mainstream.\n\"It's a stamp of approval of what we're trying to do.”\n(Reporting By Jeremy Wagstaff; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:04:18.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
