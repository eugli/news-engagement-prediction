The Arctic region is taking on increased geopolitical and economic importance as the Earth continues to warm up as a result of climate. A decline in Arctic sea ice means a new ice-free shipping route connecting the Northern Hemisphere is likely . It also means that previously unavailable resources could soon be in reach. The Department of Energy estimates 90 billion barrels of oil lie in wait under the Arctic. That's enough to keep human civilization chugging along for 2.5 years. The DoE also estimates the Arctic holds 30 percent of the world's undiscovered natural gas.

Other countries are showing newfound interest in the Arctic. Russia is beginning to resurrect a series of military bases in the region, which is worrying because the country has laid claim a large part of the Arctic including the North Pole . The U.S. has responded by conducting several high profile exercises in the region, including ICEX 2016 , which saw U.S. Army soldiers linking up with a pair of U.S. Navy nuclear submarines that pushed through the sea ice.
