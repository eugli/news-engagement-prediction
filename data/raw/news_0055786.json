Then you spot the three-floor space of Pegasystems. \nAs Operations Manager Udaya welcomes us into the office of this Hyderabad branch of the US-based MNC, you soon realise why Pegasystems has been ranked among the 25 most popular offices in the country in a national survey. \nAlthough the steel exterior at the reception area rings in a global touch, the interiors reflect true-blue Hyderabadi flavour, with images of Laad Bazaar, manjas and kites, Falaknuma Palace, Qutub Shahi Tombs, the Golkonda Fort and the Tank Bund, splashed on the walls, with a brief history attached to each. \nThe picturesque images have a three-dimensional effect and you get to see most of the iconic tourist spots of Hyderabad from a different perspective. \nMost collaboration spaces with their movable seating options, (open-meeting spaces that are very popular for photographs) and meeting rooms across the office are named after different pearls and iconic landmarks in the city. The use of purple, green, aqua and orange brighten up the floors, sofas and workstations/ cubicles as against the neutral colours like grey, and light blue for carpets, points out managing director Suman Reddy. \nThe kalamkari motif spreads across the space rather subtly, even on a royal chess board right in front of the MD’s cabin. \nWhile picturesque backdrops fill one section of the office, nature complements it with a series of flower pots and saplings in another. Recreation zones showcase the ‘work hard, play hard’ side of the techies — Table Tennis, Billiards, board games like Snakes and Ladders are all in there, with the window offering you a fascinating 360 degree view of the city. \nWe are told that the employees chip in to run a theme across the office, for festivals, annual days and other cultural events. \n“That’s how we stay true to both our company’s roots (US) and embrace our local side,” informs Suman Reddy. The cordial work atmosphere reflects both the company’s ideas and artistry of the architect Geethika Jain. Clearly the design is inspired from the history of Hyderabad, its rich account of the Nizam era and culture. Traditional arts, local culture, kalamkari motifs, images and icons of Indian and Hyderabad architecture weave it all together. \nWhile most IT firms restrict photographs inside the office, employees here make the most of the plush backdrops for selfies. \nThe decor of the lavish cafeteria that provides free lunches to its employees , offers a nationalistic perspective. The wall depicting the touristy side of the country is where the MD often holds informal meetings. \nAnother side of the cafeteria will see a gymnasium opening soon, an aspect the employees feel will complete the office. \nPegasystems India", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:46:57.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
