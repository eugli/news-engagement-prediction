Jeremy Lock/USAF \nDays after North Korea tested a new, dangerous missile type and allegedly engaged agents to assassinate Kim Jong Un’s half-brother in Malaysia, the US plans to send the big guns to the Pacific in a massive show of force. \nThe USS Carl Vinson has been making its way to the Pacific, and it will be joined by the world’s most lethal combat plane , the F-22s, a nuclear-powered submarine, and possibly B-1 and B-2 nuclear-capable bombers. \n“The two sides have agreed to send such weapons as the F-22 stealth fighter and a nuclear-powered submarine to the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises in March,” a defence official told South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency . \nUS and South Korean forces will participate in military drills together to enhance readiness and test their ability to defend against North Korean missile attacks — an ability recently challenged by North Korea’s latest missile advance. \nKey Resolve and Foal Eagle represent two annual major military drills carried out by US and South Korean troops that regularly rile up North Korea, who usually threaten some sort of “catastrophic outcome” to what they see as a US-initiated provocation.
