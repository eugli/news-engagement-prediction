David Unwin/Fairfax NZ. \nJonty Skerman's tent gets pimped. \nThe breakfast host phoned the 7-year-old, and during the on-air interview about his passion for camping, Jonty revealed his sleeping bag had also ripped. \n\"We got a lot of feedback [to the interview], our text screen went nuts,\"West said. David Unwin/Fairfax NZ. \nJonty Skerman 7, with brothers Lachie 2, and Hugo 5, tries out the new camping furniture. \nListening in was Simon O'Connor from the Palmerston North branch of Hunting & Fishing. The story resonated with him, too. \n\"We got together and put together an accessory pack to pimp his tent,\" West said. \nWhile Jonty was at school on Thursday, the pack which contained a light-weight modern fold-out camp bed, new sleeping bag, the latest in solar-powered camp lights, camo netting, a head-lamp, outdoor clothing, a cap, and a toy cross-bow with stick-on bolts, was unloaded into the tent. David Unwin/Fairfax NZ. \nJonty Skerman and younger brother Lachie with More-FM breakfast host Mike West and Simon O'Connor from Hunting & Fishing. \nHis old squab mattress and torn sleeping bag were then stowed away. \n\"I just think its great for kids to get outside and enjoy the outdoors,\" O'Connor said. \nWhen Jonty came home from school, his surprise and joy was captured on camera. \nNot even a sleek jet thundering overhead in preparation for the weekend's Air Tattoo could distract him or his two brothers, Hugo, 5, and Lachie, 2, from the surprise. \n\"It's awesome, I'm really happy,\" he said. \nJonty's mum Kym Skerman said she could see his 130-night target being extended. \n\"He won't be coming in when it gets colder,\" she said, in reference to her son's aim to stay outside until after the third frost. \n\"Third frost? Yeah, right. That's a pretty decent sleeping bag.\" \nShe said Jonty didn't seem fazed by all the media attention, and was taking it in his stride. \n\"He's pretty grounded; he's handled it all really well. It has been good for him.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:44:04.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
