(CBC)\nDunphy's lawyers applied to have Dr. Stephen Czarnuch called as an expert witness, to testify about Smyth's claim that he acted in self defence.\nInquiry commissioner Judge Leo Barry said the experiment would have too many variables to be useful to the inquiry.\n\"The experiment results will be too speculative and uncertain because of the many variables involved,\" he said.\nHe also questioned if an expert was necessary to determine whether Dunphy could have done what Smyth claims.\n\"I will be arriving at my own independent conclusion as to whether Const. Smyth's description of what occurred is plausible. I do not need expert opinion in order to do this,\" Barry said.\nSummary of Barry's decision on chair experiment #dunphy pic.twitter.com/2unRfPrhSf\n— @CBCMarkQuinn Polygraph not done The inquiry heard Monday from retired RCMP Staff Sgt. Tom Townsend, who was in charge of polygragh testing in Newfoundland and Labrador and other Atlantic provinces.\nDuring the shooting investigation, He was asked by RCMP investigators if a polygraph of Smyth would be useful.
