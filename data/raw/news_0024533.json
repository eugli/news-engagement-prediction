Key points: Today could be the hottest February day on record for NSW Volunteer and professional firefighters are on standby for \"extraordinary\" fire conditions Sporting events have been postponed across the state \nA total fire ban is in force over the weekend amid fears that conditions could deteriorate to catastrophic in some areas of NSW tomorrow. \n\"We are expecting some of the worst possible conditions across New South Wales this weekend,\" NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. \n\"The traditional scale of fire risk forecasting — this is working off the scale. We can expect fire behaviour to be extraordinary. \n\"Today we are going to see large areas dominated by severe fire danger ratings. That is particularly from the Central West areas of New South Wales back in along the ranges, the Southern Ranges, the Central Ranges and then right out across the greater Hunter region,\" he said. \n\"That means no fires out in the open, no solid fuel fires or barbeques across the weekend,\" Paul Best from RFS said. \n\"Electric barbecues and gas barbeques in a residential setting, they're all fine.\" External Link: Interactive animation shows temperatures around Australia over the past week NSW could beat heat records in hottest month \nThe NSW weather bureau is predicting today could become the hottest February day on record for the state. Heatwaves kill far more people than other natural disasters. ABC Emergency has a checklist of things you can do to be ready. \nHay in the state's south-west is expected to reach a top of 46 degrees Celsius today. \nA maximum temperature of 39C expected in Sydney, while the mercury is expected to reach 45C at Penrith and 43C at Blacktown in the city's west. \nDespite Sydney getting some reprieve with lower temperatures on Sunday, Mr Fitzsimmons warned that conditions in other parts of the state could become catastrophic. \n\"Tomorrow, conditions will deteriorate further with widespread extreme and catastrophic conditions being forecast which will again extend right from parts of our Central West back along the ranges, north along the ranges, right down through the Hunter region, right out to the coast. \n\"In so many ways, they are unprecedented fire risk conditions for this part of New South Wales. \n\"That band of catastrophic extends from the Central West right across the table lands to Hunter region,\" he said. \nThe bureau is expecting Newcastle to see a top of 37C for Saturday with temperatures increasing to 42C on Sunday. \nProfessional and voluntary fire crews are on high alert across the state, the RFS said. People urged to have fire plans ready \nThe fire service has urged people to make sure they have bushfire plans ready in case faced with a fire emergency over the weekend. \n\"They need to make a bushfire survival plan and have that discussion with their families about what they're going to do,\" Mr Best said. \n\"Stay up to date by checking the RFS website, the fires near me smartphone app or by listening to radio.\" Photo: Most of NSW is experiencing temperatures over 40C today. (Supplied: Bureau of Meteorology) \nNSW Lifesavers are bracing for what they expect could be one of the busiest weekends of the season, with thousands of people expected to flock to beaches seeking relief from the heat. \n\"These extreme temperatures means that heat stress is a very real risk for those out in the sun,\" Andy Kent from Surf Life Saving NSW said. \n\"If left untreated it can lead to more serious conditions of heat stroke … so it's important to watch family members and friends.\" \nSwimmers are being urged to stay between the red and yellow flags and only swim at patrolled beaches. \n\"Watch out for children around any body of water,\" Mr Kent said. \n\"We are urging the public to do what they can to help lessen the load by taking some responsibility for their own safety.\" Sporting events postponed \nA number of amateur and professional sporting events have cancelled across the state. \nCricket NSW said it has cancelled all grades of its premier amateur competition and it has urged other Sydney cricketing associations to do the same. \n\"My main concern is that Grade Cricket does not have the infrastructure in place to safely monitor and manage heat stroke in what is essentially an amateur volunteer-run organisation,\" Cricket NSW Doctor John Orchard said. \nMeanwhile racegoers will have to delay their excitement with the postponement of today's race meeting at Royal Randwick featuring champion mayor Winx. \nLife Saving Carnivals and championships scheduled over the weekend could also be postponed or cancelled. \nAll national parks in the Upper Central West and North West have also been forced to close due to the heat and high fire danger ratings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:58:14.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
