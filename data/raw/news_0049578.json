The no-hitter was the first for a Tigers hurler in 38 years. Bobby Landry threw a no-hitter against USM in 1979. Five of the six no-hitters came in seven-inning games. Fred Southerland had the nine-inning no-hitter against Tulane in 1962. Poche struck out four – all in the first two innings. He was supported by some outstanding defense – particularly by Robertson at shortstop. The only Army base-runner was Josh White who reached when Deichmann missed his shallow fly ball in the fourth inning. The victory was the 28th of Poche’s career. He is one victory shy of reaching the top ten list for LSU pitchers.\nPoche’s comments: “I still can’t believe it happened. My dad said (Friday) that I was going to throw a no-hitter. I said ‘why did you say that. I will probably get hit all around the park.’ Then (no-hitter) happened. I wasn’t thinking about the no-hitter until the fifth inning because the score was 0-0. Then, we got some runs. I went out there today and filled up the zone. I let my defense make the plays. None of this would have been possible without the plays made by Kramer, Cole and Josh.”\nNOTES\nThere was one change in LSU’s starting lineup for the first game. Breaux replaced Beau Jordan in leftfield. Army started a righthanded pitcher in the first game, so the lefthanded-hitting Breaux was in the lineup. Breaux batted ninth in the lineup. Slaughter hit fifth in the batting order – the spot supposed to be occupied by Jordan, who was in leftfield in the second game. . .Four players had hits in both games of the doubleheader – Freeman (4-for-7), Slaughter (2-for-4), Adams (2-for-5) and Deichmann (2-for-6). . .Caleb Gilbert and Austin Bain each threw a shutout inning in the opener. . .The last time the Tigers won both games of a doubleheader by a shutout was 1986 when they swept Mississippi State 4-0 and 4-0 at Starkville. . .The last time LSU won its first two games of a season by a shutout was 1996 when it beat Western Kentucky 9-0 and 18-0. . .The last time the Tigers began the season with a doubleheader was 2001 against Kansas State at The Box. LSU and the Wildcats split the doubleheader. The Tigers won their first two games for the 16th straight year. In 2001, LSU lost its season-opener to Kansas State (9-8). . . Army is 0-3 for the season. . .Eric Walker will be the starting pitcher for the Tigers in the game against Air Force on Sunday afternoon. . .The paid attendance for the first game was 10,834. The actual crowd for the first game was about 5,400. . .The paid attendance for the second game was 11,174. The actual crowd for the second game was about 7,400.\nFROM THE LOCKER ROOM\nCoach Paul Mainieri’s comments: “Jared seemed pretty determined, particularly at the end of the game. He was like he was against Rice in the regional last year when he came out of the bullpen. The defense by Kramer Robertson was unbelievable. It was a real team effort. We got some good clutch hitting late in the second game, some good two-strike hitting. You are worried in a seven-inning game. One bad break can turn the tide. We got some great pitching today from Poche and Alex Lange.”\nUP NEXT\nLSU will play host to Air Force at The Box on Sunday. First pitch is scheduled for 1 p.m. Central. The Falcons (2-1) split a doubleheader against Tulane in New Orleans on Saturday. Air Force lost the first game 4-3 and won the second game 3-2. The LSU-Air Force game will be available on the SEC Digital Network.\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/d0lvunsoiivgxj6ocdnh)", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/d0lvunsoiivgxj6ocdnh"], "published": "2017-02-19T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T19:25:39.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
