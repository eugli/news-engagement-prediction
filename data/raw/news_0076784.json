a panel of more than a dozen experts and charity chiefs who look at welfare policy.\nRead More Jeremy Corbyn signs bid to kill off law denying increased disability benefits to 150,000 people But today Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green said the SSAC \"still have the power to look at these regulations and make recommendations\".\nThe committee's next monthly meeting is next Wednesday and it is understood the PIP row is almost certain to be raised.\nThe Social Security Advisory Committee routinely examines benefit changes (Photo: REX/Shutterstock) The SSAC has the power to demand a written response from the Tory minister and recommend he changes specific points in the policy.\nConfirmation came after angry exchanges in the House of Commons that saw MPs condemn the \"callous\" and \"distressing\" shake-up.\nShadow Work and Pensions Secretary Debbie Abrahams said: \"Disabled people are twice as likely to live in poverty. How many disabled people will be driven into debt or face poverty as a result of these cuts?\n\"What is the cumulative effect of these cuts along with [ESA disability benefit] cuts that are due to come into effect in April, which will affect 500,000 disabled people?\"\nTory minister Mr Green shot back: \"It is simply not a cut. It is not entirely honest of her to say that it is a cut.\"\nBut he was rapped by Commons Speaker John Bercow, who said: \"There can be no accusation of dishonesty in this chamber.\"\nDebbie Abrahams demanded: \"How many disabled people will be driven into debt?\" Later Mr Green claimed \"the idea this was slipped out is simply ridiculous\" - despite the fact the laws were published on the day of two by-elections.\nAnd he claimed it was \"simply wrong to say this will deny people PIP\" - despite his own equality analysis saying 165,000 people would have got higher payments.\nLabour's Rachel Reeves accused him of \"overruling the courts and depriving these people of the support they desperately need.\"\nSNP MP Corri Wilson said the mentally ill were worst-hit, adding: \"We cannot and should not pit one disability against another.\"\nLabour MP David Winnick said: \"The strong feeling among so many of the vulnerable that they will again be in the firing line.\"\nLabour MP Angela Eagle added: \"Long-term disabled people are being denied [PIP] and being caused massive amounts of distress by the process. They feel utter despair at having to have anything to do with it.\"\nEven Tory MP Peter Bone - who heaped praise on the \"caring\" minister - said: \"I am fed up with seeing every week a constituent who clearly should have been awarded PIP but is not getting it.\"\nDamian Green faced angry questions in the House of Commons (Photo: REUTERS) The tribunals that are being blocked said people who suffer \"overwhelming psychological distress\" when they leave home should score higher in PIP assessments than they do now.\nThat includes people with autism, dementia, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress and depression.\nLabour MP Jim Fitzpatrick read a letter from a PTSD and anxiety sufferer condemning George Freeman - the No10 policy chief who said benefits should only go to the \"really disabled\".\nThe letter said: \"I am deeply distressed and angry about his remarks. Considering the current lack of funding and social stigma that mentally disabled people already have to suffer, this is beyond the pale.\"\nAt least 28 MPs including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have signed a Lib Dem motion to kill off the PIP changes completely.\nThey took effect on February 23, but can be annulled if the House of Commons votes against the motion within 40 days and nights.\nThere is no guaranteed vote and the last time a similar law was defeated in the same way was 1979.\nMr Green said he had spoken to the SSAC's chairman before announcing the law and ministers will meet the mental health charity Mind.\nHe added: \"This is not a policy change or a cut. Nobody will receive less benefit than they were originally awarded by the DWP.\"\n Labour Party Conservative Party Liberal Democrats Department for Work and Pensions House of Commons George Freeman Jeremy Corbyn Angela Eagle Jim Fitzpatrick David Winnick John Bercow Damian Green Pensions strike Mental health Disability Politics Asperger’s syndrome", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/510/4221396001_5341368025001_5341353051001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2326/4221396001_5341184369001_5341159350001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorPolitics", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2454/4221396001_5341225032001_5341208630001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1942/4221396001_5341449084001_5341429298001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2726/4221396001_5341247857001_5341239636001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2358/4221396001_5341360552001_5341360066001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/914/4221396001_5341219668001_5341213633001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/578/4221396001_5341270950001_5341269295001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001"], "published": "2017-02-28T20:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T20:32:42.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
