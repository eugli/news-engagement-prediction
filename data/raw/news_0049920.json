Harriet Kauffman 2 Shane Barnbrook, 36, from Victoria, Australia, was left a quadriplegic after accidentally consuming a wishbone \nDuring February 2012, Shane was playing a computer game and eating some leftover chicken curry, not realising there was a large bone in the meal. \nHe accidentally swallowed it, but neither Shane nor his wife Sarah made a big fuss out of it at first. \nThe couple decided the only course of action was to patiently wait for the bones to re-emerge, but things took a turn for the worse. Alamy 2 Healthcare professionals found a hole in Shane’s rectum and a profound abscess on his abdominal wall after he swallowed the bone \nShane said on the the podcast 2 Keto Dudes last year: “About two days later, it got caught behind my chest and I had indigestion. \n“By Thursday night I was feeling really sick.” \nAs he decided to go and see the doctor, his chest tightened up and he thought he was going to have a heart attack. \nHis wife, Sarah, who at the time was nine months pregnant with their third child, called for an ambulance. \nHe told them he had pain radiating through one arm and had swallowed a chicken bone a few days prior, The Age reported.

I couldn’t stand or even sit in the seat. \n“The last thing I remember was they took me to the emergency room, and I projectile vomited about three metres.” \nHe was transported to Melbourne’s Northern Hospital for more advanced care, and a surgical team opened up his abdomen. \nThere were signs of an infection, but according to Shane’s lawyers, the doctors did not look for a puncture in the rectum. \nThe last thing I remember was they took me to the emergency room, and I projectile vomited about three metres Shane Barnbrook \nShane’s condition continued to deteriorate, to the point where his wife Sarah was eventually told her husband would not survive. \nShane said: “This all started on the 1st February. \n“By the 11th, they called a Catholic priest to read my last rights. They said “He’s not going to make it through the night”.” \nA few days later, Sarah gave birth to the couple’s third child. \nFortunately Shane survived, and surgeons were given a chance to take yet another look at his abdomen. \nThis time, they found a hole in his rectum and a profound abscess on his abdominal wall. \nHe remained in the hospital’s Intensive Care Unit as they attempted to treat him, but when he woke up a week later, he was a quadriplegic. \nHe said: “I couldn’t move anything below my neck. \n“Imagine having an itchy nose and you can’t move to scratch it, you can’t talk to say that. You just have to lie there and deal with it.” \nHe said the condition came from critical illness neuropathy, which is a disease of the nerves. \nShane spent the next four years in rehabilitation and a nursing home, before he finally was able to return home this year. \nImagine having an itchy nose and you can’t move to scratch it, you can’t talk to say that. You just have to lie there and deal with it Shane Barnbrook \nMaurice Blackburn Lawyers say they are now taking legal action against the two hospitals on Shane’s behalf. \nThey are claiming that if doctors had listened to him and treated him faster, he would have made a full recovery. \nTom Ballantyne, a principal in Maurice Blackburn’s medical negligence department said: “This is a tragic case. It illustrates the catastrophic and life-changing consequences that can stem from medical errors. \n“There were numerous opportunities to make the correct diagnosis and intervene, but instead, events have snowballed to the point where Mr Barnbrook now has a severe and lifelong disability.” \nShane was not available for further comment. \nThe Sun Online has contacted Seymour Hospital and Northern Hospital in Melbourne for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:09:47.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
