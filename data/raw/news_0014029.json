Martinelli | February 4, 2017 2:58 pm Follow @MMartinelli4 \nThink you’re going to put out the best Super Bowl spread Sunday? Think again. \nNo matter the variety of wings, the intensity of the nachos or the juiciness of the burgers, these architectural and culinary masterminds take Super Bowl finger food to an unparalleled level with their “snack stadiums.” \nIntricate planned and strategically organized, these stadiums are works of art, and the geniuses behind the creations know what they’re doing. \nSean Aron, a call-center manager from suburban Phoenix, takes his stadiums a step further, building a food replica of the actual Super Bowl sites, according to the Wall Street Journal . Last year, that even included using iPad Minis as jumbotrons. \nMore from the WSJ: \nA growing fringe of snackadium builders like Mr. Aron spend days meticulously constructing elaborate football-arena models using Super Bowl party food. Guacamole end zones rest under beef-jerky goal posts. Spectator stands seat hot wings, sliders and sushi. Cocktail weenies become players with Frito helmets. Cheese blocks perched on skewers make excellent stadium lights. \nHere are some of the best snack stadiums bouncing around the internet. Looks like I need to up my snack stadium game: \"We Have Sunk to This: Replica Super Bowl Stadiums Made of Snacks\" https://t.co/5DiR0RYKO2 pic.twitter.com/J8koRpAfy5 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:06:30.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
