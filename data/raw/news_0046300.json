Earlier today, Urbanize LA spotted a freshly released initial study that includes plenty of information about the project, called 6AM, as well as a couple new renderings. One of those renderings emphasizes the massive scale of the project’s two 58-story towers that would dwarf the neighborhood’s lower-slung residential complexes and industrial structures. The two towers are set to rise 732 and 710 feet, respectively—which would make them the seventh and 11th tallest buildings in Los Angeles if they were completed tomorrow. The taller tower would contain a mix of condos and hotel rooms, along with retail and parking. The other would include a mix of apartments and retail, as well as parking. All told, the seven-building complex would add 1,305 apartments to the neighborhood, on top of 412 hotel rooms (divided between the 58-story tower and a separate eight-story boutique hotel), 431 condos, a 253,514-square-foot office building, more than 125,000 square feet of commercial space, 23,000 square feet of art-centered space, and a three-floor school and park. The project is designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron. It will be the firm’s first LA project, and, as such, local firm AC Martin and Partners is helping out by bringing “local expertise and understanding” to the project, according to SunCal spokesman David Soyka .
