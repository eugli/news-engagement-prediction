On Friday, the agency held what it called a united voices rally at the company’s office in Beverly Hills in support of immigrant rights and in opposition to Trump’s policies.

This doesn’t feel right. And we need to pay attention to how this feels at this time in this country.’” \nCelebrities, including Kristen Wiig, Aaron Paul, Piper Perabo, Jamie Dornan, Nick Offerman, Kat Graham, and Bill Nye, showed up, according to Nylon, as well as more than 1,500 other people. \nThe agency donated $250,000 to the International Rescue Committee and the ACLU , and raised an additional $70,000 through a crowdfunding campaign.

It’s a singular time in history. It’s time to engage. \n“No matter who you voted for ― red or blue, whether you’re white, black, or brown, or all the colors of the identity rainbow, this is our time to resist,” Foster added. “It’s our time to show up and demand answers. It’s our time to tell our elected officials to do their jobs.” AFP via Getty Images Protesters attend the United Voices rally outside the United Talent Agency in Beverly Hills, California on February 24, 2017. \nComedian Keegan-Michael Key focused on the power artists have to inspire change. “We have the ability to educate,” he said. “We have the ability to effect change, to bring people together, and to even sometimes bring light when there’s a whole lot of darkness. We’re the ones who have been given the mantle to tell everybody’s story. Whether you be trans, whether you be black, whether you be Latino, whether you be disabled ― we’re here to be a platform for you .” . @KeeganMKey the first speaker at the rally.

Your actions are heartwarming,” Farhadi said.
