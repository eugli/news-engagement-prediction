But the real reveal, for those fans keeping track, is the confirmation of Cyborg as a playable character in the new roster. \n“In my years fighting crime, I’ve learned one truth — that every villain is the hero of his own story,” Batman says. Confronting the strongman as he ravages what looks to be Arkham Asylum, Superman says the battle only ends “when there’s no more crime.” \nWhile characters like Supergirl, Brainiac, Swamp Thing, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, Black Canary , Gorilla Grodd, Deadshot, and Atrocitus were all previously confirmed for Injustice 2 , Cyborg now has his moment in the spotlight as he battles Blue Beetle and blasts Batman through a portal to Apokolips. (Speaking of which, don’t forget you can pre-order the game now to score Darkseid at launch.) \nThe rest of the trailer plays out as a showdown between Bats and Supes, who flings the Caped Crusader into the clouds for a brutal blow. Watch it above. \nInjustice 2 drops this May 16.
