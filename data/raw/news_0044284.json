The amazingly rendered T-1000 [Credit: TriStar Pictures] \nComputer generated imagery has undoubtedly taken great strides in the last twenty five years. While audiences were wowed by the sleek, shape shifting of Robert Patrick’s T-1000 in 1991, the kind of effects work seen in films such as Terminator 2: Judgement Day has become commonplace, with characters, weather and worlds being designed and created in offices, rather than being replicated onset. \nThis has unequivocally been a boon to the industry , yet the practice, as we know, is not without pitfalls. For every lusciously designed production as Avatar , there are the almost cartoonish effects of #Wolverine ’s claws in X-Men Origins: Wolverine that tarnish the reputation of this industry-wide practice. The lack of substance or tactility to the CGI can “take you out” of the film if you can tell that it’s an effect. When another city is being leveled, how can you care if you know it’s not real? Wolverine and his dodgy claws [Credit: 20th Century Fox] \nReality is dependent upon each person’s perspective. To demonstrate this division perfectly, we only have to look at the reaction to Peter Cushing’s digital resurrection as Grand Moff Tarkin in Rogue One. Ethical questions aside , some fans have raved about its intricacy, hailing it as a landmark in the future of effects-work, while others compared his likeness to a bad video game, referring to it as \"monstrous\". \nOverall, it does seem as though everyone has become more discerning where special effects are concerned. Fans are very quick to point out unfinished VFX shots in trailers, and this attitude has extended into the industry itself. The grim and gritty 'Logan' [Credit: 20th Century Fox] \n#Logan director James Mangold famously railed against the excess of modern Hollywood effects in a way that would make the titular grumpy mutant proud. On his Instagram, Mangold posted a page of the shooting script , which notably read: \n“...if you're on the make for a hyper choreographed, gravity defying, city-block destroying, CG fuckathon, this ain't your movie.” \nThe gritty approach that we see in Logan is most certainly reminiscent of the intensity found in the aforementioned corridor battles. So are they both related? Are they part of some larger, industrial shift? Practical Effects Vs VFX The animatronic T-Rex from Jurassic Park [Credit: Universal Pictures] \nThough these hallway assaults are more likely the result of lower budgets and tonal requirements, it really does seem as if CGI is being shunned for older movie making techniques. For example, Steven Spielberg used both animatronics and CGI to bring the dinosaurs to life in Jurassic Park in 1993. \nTwenty two years later, Colin Trevorrow lobbied for a robotic Apatosaurus to be made for one of the most touching scenes in #JurassicWorld . He later enthused about the greater fulfillment that was born from the process to Wired: \n\"We had a team of puppeteers using every tiny motor in this robot's face. They drew a beautiful performance out of the actors -- we couldn't have done it with a computer.\" \nThe argument and preference for prosthetics, animatronics, miniatures and real locations appears to be gaining even more traction for projects in production.

And Denis Villeneuve was very quick to reassure fans that Blade Runner 2049 would feature very little digital trickery . \nSo what does this mean for the future of movies and television? Can we expect even more corridor fights, and similarly old-school settings and techniques? The Future of Corridor Fights and VFX Doctor Strange - a blend of practical and computer generated effects [Credit:Marvel Studios] \nIt may seem as if we’re fully returning to the days of practical effects, but as ever, it’s not that clean cut. Modern filmmakers don’t just use CGI to create eye-popping wonders, but it’s also harnessed to tinker subtly with movies in ways that are not always obvious. For example, lots of the inclement weather in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was created digitally, as was the exterior of #BenAffleck ’s house in Gone Girl . You wouldn’t have expected dramas to utilize such methods, but here they are, seamlessly helping the movie makers to subtly heighten the spectacle so that the film succeeds in telling its story well.

Remember how the major hits of Mad Max: Fury Road and Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens were embraced by audiences because of their retro feel? Well, it turns out that they were digitally tweaked far more than they had let on. Heck, several of the corridor fights mentioned at the start of this piece used special effects to merge shots and enhance the experience. \nThe thing is, many people have noticed just what a nostalgic time we’re living in at the moment, what with the resurrection of old franchises like #StarWars and series like Stranger Things echoing our love of the 80’s. By building up their use of these old practical methods, studios play to our love of the past, and continue to draw in the crowds. As Bryan Curtis says for The New Yorker, the use of corridor fights and practical effects isn’t only about doing what’s best for the film, but rather so that studios: \n“...recreate the sensations of a particular period—the sound of A.T.-A.T. walkers marching through the snow, or the feeling of wonder when a child reaches out to pet a dinosaur.” \nIt also helps that the industry itself has long been nostalgic for its heydays. For example La La Land and The Artist are loving tributes to classical Hollywood, and they have both been rapidly were embraced by the Academy Awards- a clear showcase of their sentimentality.

This ongoing antipathy towards computer generated effects will no doubt rise and fade in popularity, as talents and types of movies have before it. This has happened before after all, with actors such as Mel Gibson being slowly welcomed back to the fold, and the Western genre slowly making its stumbling steps back into the light. \nEventually, we’ll probably see an even greater synergy between both practical and special effects, with motion capture on the rise and technology improving all the time. Time will tell how this happens, as it will with the popularity of corridor fights, but as ever, we can enjoy it whilst it lasts.
