The present crop of players want to have a feel of what club greats like Christian Chukwu and Emmanuel Okala felt back in the day. \nWith the likes of Chisom Egbuchulam in full flow and ably supported by Godwin Aguda, Chinedu Udeagha and the impressive Senegalese defender Pape Ousmane Sane, coach Imama Amapakabo assembled a team that played arguably the best football by a Nigerian club side last term. \nRangers started the 2017 Caf Champions League on a good note, pulling off an impressive draw against north African opposition in Algeria in the preliminary round. A 1-1 away draw in the first leg against Jeunesse Sportive de Saoura [below] was followed by a goalless draw in Enugu which meant that Rangers qualified on the away goals rule to put one leg into the group stage. \nBut before that can happen, there is the little matter of another north African opposition. \nAfrican powerhouse Zamalek stands between Rangers and a place in the group stage of the 2017 Caf Champions League. The Egyptians have been a bogey team for Nigerian sides for the better part of three decades and will not be an easy prey for Rangers. Nigerian clubs have not had a smooth ride with Egyptian clubs in the Caf club competitions. \nFive-time winners of the competition, Zamalek defeated Shooting Stars Sports Club of Ibadan in 1984 in the African Cup of Champions Clubs Final. [below] The tie, held over two legs in November and December, was a virtual walkover for the north Africans, who won the two legs with a 3–0 aggregate, earning the Knights their first African Cup. The day after the 2nd leg, Shooting Stars FC were temporarily disbanded by the government for their performance. \nTen years later it was 'de ja vu' when the two locked horns in the final of the Caf Champions League. Shooting Stars won the first leg 2-1 but then lost the second leg by the same margin, which meant the tie went to penalties. The Egyptian side won 4-3 on penalties to hand Zamalek their fourth Caf Champions League title, leaving the Nigerians wondering what could have been. \nEnyimba, who represented Nigeria in last season’s Caf Champions League, met Zamalek [below] in the group stage of the competition.The Egyptians defeated Enyimba 1-0 in the first group game in Port Harcourt and also won 2-1 in the reverse leg to continue the recent Egyptian dominance over Nigerian clubs \nFormed in 1911 as Qasr El-Neel Club, the side underwent a series of structure and ,name change before finally emerging as Zamalek Football Club in 1952. Zamalek is nicknamed the ‘White Knights’ which is effectively represented in the club logo, and they command a large following in Egypt just behind their bitter rivals Al Ahly. \nThe current squad contains two Nigerians, who might just be the men to put paid to Rangers' quest for a slot in the group stage. Former Flying Eagles striker Stanley Ohawuchi [below] has been in good form since he joined Zamalek from fellow Egyptian side Wadi Degla. \nThe 26-year-old played for Heartland Football Club and Bayelsa United before he headed out to Malta via Spain, eventually finding his way to Zamalek. Ohawuchi is a striker who can also play on the wings, where he has been deployed of late by Zamalek, because of his pace and technical abilities. Rangers will have to do well to shut him out. \nMarouf Yousuf is the second Nigerian in the Zamalek side aiming to beat Rangers and get to the group stage. The 25-year-old is a midfielder who packs a powerful shot and is deadly from set-pieces. A central midfielder who can also play from the wings, Yousuf has not been a regular in the team lately, even though he is still an integral part of the squad. \nYousuf and Ohawuchi will not be the only players who pose a threat to Rangers' Caf Champions League ambitions. Egypt’s first choice goalkeeper Mohammed El-Shenawi is the man usually used between the sticks for Zamalek who also have Pharaoh's defender Ali Gabr, midfielder Mustafa Fathi, Tarek Ahmed and striker Barsem Morsi as the star men in the team. \nEgyptian football journalist Tarek Talaat told superpsort.com that the current Zamalek squad is one of the best in recent times, and he feels that they can edge Rangers International. He insists that they are not only good enough for the group stage, but the trophy as well. \n“Zamalek have a much better and balanced squad than they’ve had for some time now since the current chairman Mortada Mansour took the charge of the club four years ago,” Talaat revealed. “They play beautiful attacking football and they are known as the ‘School of Arts’ because of the offensive style. \n“Zamalek have some very skillful players like team captain Mahmoud Abdel Razek Shikabala, who is the team captain, Aymen Hefny who wears jersey number 14. The fans call him ‘Leo Hefny’ coined from Barcelona’s Lionel Messi because they share similarities in their play. Mostafa Fathy is another one to keep an eye on because he is skillful and can destroy any team on his own. \n“Ali Gaber and the attacker Basem Morsy are important members of the Zamalek squad and bring in a lot of experience. They also have two good goalkeepers in Ahmed El Shenawy and Mahmoud Gensh. Zamalek are a good side who will trouble Rangers when they meet. I believe they are good enough to qualify for the group stage and challenge for the Champions League title,” Talaat added. \nThe current Nigerian champions will travel to Egypt for the first leg knowing that North Africa has not exactly been a fertile hunting ground for Nigerian teams, but Rangers will look to change that. Meanwhile the second leg at ‘The Cathedral’ in Enugu will be tough for the Egyptians because the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium has been a virtual fortress for the Flying Antelopes. Come game day it will be packed by the 30 000 Enugu faithful [below] who will be hoping to emulate Enyimba’s feat of last season by qualifying for the group stage. \nRangers will have to be at their best if they are to see off Zamalek and book a place in the Caf Champions League group stage for the first time in their history. The first leg in Cairo will be played between 10-12 March while the second leg is set for the weekend of 17-19 March. \nThe winner of the tie will qualify for the group stage of the 2017 Caf Champions League. © supersport.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:33:13.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
