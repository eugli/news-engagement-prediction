Shout Out from Stephanie Jameson, the owner of the new Savory Salads restaurant in Arlington Heights. (Karen Ann Cullotta / Pioneer Press) Karen Ann Cullotta , which is my hometown. Looking back, I was just a kid, but it went really well. I graduated from Loyola University Chicago with a political science degree, and I had planned on going to law school. But after I came back from spending a semester abroad in Colchester, England, I didn't jump right into taking the LSAT as I had planned. Living in England made me realize that I wanted to re-think things. I learned about the restaurant business through basic trial and error, but my parents have helped me out a lot, and my dad was involved as an investor.\nQ: How did you learn to cook? \nA: I'm from a Greek family, and both of my parents are fantastic cooks. The stereotype about Greek families always having a lot of great food on the table is totally true. Some of the items on the menu, like my Greek salad, I've been helping my parents make at home for years. And I've always been a big foodie. I love to try out different restaurants and experiment with recipes. Most of our menu is made from scratch, including our dressings, homemade bread and soups. \nQ: Did your family and your time in Europe influence your attitudes toward healthy eating? \nA: Absolutely. For example, we offer two sizes for many of the items on our menu, small, which is a single serving, and large, which can be shared. One of our items on the menu is our Toasties, which are small sandwiches which I first had in England. \nQ: Can you tell us a little bit about your #fitfoodies challenge? \nA: We're challenging people to get healthy at both our Barrington and Arlington Heights locations. We are going to be engaging our customers in joining a Fitbit challenge, and the winner of the Work Week Hustle Challenges will win a $100 gift card. Throughout the challenges, I will personally be posting my journey on getting healthy in 2017, and in each of the challenge groups the challengers will not only compete against each other, but against me as well. \nQ: So, what is your favorite salad? \nA: Hmm â€¦ I have a lot of favorites. But one of them is our Southwest salad, which has our fresh herb and buttermilk ranch dressing, mixed greens, homemade tortilla strips, avocado, red onion, tomato, cucumber, corn and jicama. \nkcullotta@tribpub.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:33:32.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
