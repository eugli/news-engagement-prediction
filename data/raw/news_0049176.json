ADVERTISEMENT \nFirst aid responders were sent to Mactan’s Pier 4 to provide immediate treatment to the wounded passengers. \nThe ferry was carrying 90 passengers and 11 crewmen when it collided with the barge. \nA passenger, Fredamae Bereso, recalled watching a Korean drama on board the business class section of St. Braquiel while waiting for the vessel to dock at Pier 4 here around 10 p.m. on Saturday. \nShe was jolted by a loud thud while the vessel was approaching the first Mandaue-Mactan Bridge on the Mactan Channel, which separates Cebu from Mactan Island. \nBefore she realized what was happening, she was thrown into a table and chair. \nIt turned out that St. Braquiel hit a barge, SMC No. 8, which was carrying cases of beer and owned by Philmarine Services Corp. \nOf the 58 passengers injured, 23 had to be brought to hospitals. \nAmong them is Bereso, who suffered bruises in the face and legs, and Reniero Maurin, captain of St. Braquiel. \n“I panicked when I saw what happened to my fellow passengers,” Bereso said. \nNoses bleeding \n“Noses were bleeding and I found some teeth on the floor. Others where thrown at the corner of the vessel while some chairs were detached,” she said. \nThe passengers were told to put on their life jackets. \nAnother vessel of 2Go, MV St. Jhudiel, was sent to rescue the passengers. \nAccording to Bereso, it took almost two hours for the rescue vessel to arrive, however. \nBereso was among those given first aid on the scene. \nThe Cebu station of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) required the vessel owners to submit marine protests, or reports about the accident. \nSpeed limit \nThe barge, bound for Cebu City from Estancia town in Iloilo province, suffered dents on its rear and left portions. The tugboat towing the barge, PSC Matatag, did not suffer any damage. \nJohn Manuel Alip, PCG Cebu station commander, said investigators would check if either vessel exceeded the speed limit of 5 knots on the Mactan Channel. \nHe said the barge traveled at 2.8 knots. The speed of St. Braquiel is being checked, he added. \nAccording to a PCG report in Manila, St. Braquiel apparently encountered engine trouble when it collided with the barge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:48:06.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
