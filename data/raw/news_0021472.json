(NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images)   \nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer took a page out of the President Trump playbook Thursday, engaging in a combative back-and-forth exchange with reporters and appearing to get caught up in his, and his boss', own web of ambiguous statements. \nDuring a particularly tense back-and-forth during his daily press briefing, Spicer called reporters \"silly\" for remaining insistent he answer specific questions about Trump's recent comments about the judiciary and, moments, later, ripped them for asking follow up questions. \n\"The President is going to speak his mind… that goes back to Thomas Jefferson that Presidents talk about judicial nominees,\" Spicer said, referencing Trump's repeated insults of the judges who have frozen his executive order on immigration, pending a more comprehensive review. \n\"One branch talking or commenting about another branch is as old as the republic,\" he said. \nA reporter then asked Spicer why Trump was not \"concerned\" about the mere appearance of his comments, which politics-watchers have suggested creates the image that Trump is trying to influence the judicial branch. \n\"Where has this outrage been for the last 100 years,\" an increasingly agitated Spicer said. \n\"Part of the reason the President got elected is because he speaks his mind… he's not going to hold back when he feels passionate,\" Spicer said. \nWhen other reporters, however, expressed that the question, as well as others, were not being answered, the exchange became even more combative. \nSean Spicer reverses assessment of Yemen raid, calls it a success \n\"Thank you, you've now asked the question about eight times,\" Spicer said. \nA moment later, another reporter asked a question about the \"the contrast\" between \"the President's repeated statements about Nordstrom\" and \"the lack of comments about other things,\" including the recent attack in Quebec. \nSpicer didn't respond kindly. \n\"I literally stand at this podium and opened the briefing a couple of days ago about the President expressing his condolences. I literally opened the beginning about it. So for you to sit here… and say… why are you asking why he didn't do it when I literally stood here did it,\" Spicer said angrily. \n\"I came out here and actually spoke about it,\" he added. \n\"You're equating me addressing the nation here (with) a tweet? That's the silliest thing I've heard. This is silly,\" he continued, as the reporter tried to get a word in. \n\"Thank you — you've asked your questions,\" Spicer said. \nSpicer has been criticized repeatedly for his brash style at press briefings. \nHis behavior even earned him an impersonation on \"Saturday Night Live,\" last weekend where he was played by a comically irate Melissa McCarthy.
