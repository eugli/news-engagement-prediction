Sunday. (KPRC) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, February 27, 2017, 5:55 PM \nA Texas teen remarkably survived after his car plunged from a 7-story parking garage and flipped upside down onto a hardware store’s roof Sunday afternoon. \n“He’s fortunate,” Houston Fire Captain Al Castillo told the Star-Telegram . “God was on his side.” \nThe teen – who wasn’t seriously hurt – managed to crawl through the debris, Castillo said. \nHe said the teen was taken to a hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. The teen’s identity wasn’t immediately known. \nNo other injuries were reported. \nPhotos of the scene showed the car inside the massive hole as the roof caved in. \nThe driver appeared to have accidentally hit the gas instead of the brake, firefighters said, KHOU-TV reported. The teen had minor injuries, fire officials said. (KPRC) \nA crane managed to pull the car from the roof. \nWestheimer Plumbing and Hardware owner Mary Ambrose told the Daily News she received a call about a car that flipped on her business' roof Sunday. \nThe shop’s showroom where showerheads and other plumbing tools are sold had “significant damages,” she said. \nAnd about 2 to 3 inches of water, resulting from damaged pipes, inundated the store, added Ambrose. \nIn the meantime, she said the shop has moved to another location nearby while repairs are being made. \n“I’m thankful that none of our staff or clients were inside when the crash happened,” Ambrose said, adding she's glad the driver survived the impact.
