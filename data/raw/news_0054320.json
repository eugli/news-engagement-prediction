ABC News: Adrienne Francis \nThe Turnbull Government looks set to unwind the Medicare rebate freeze in the May budget, a move that could cost in excess of $3 billion. Key points: Cabinet ministers say Government needs to dramatically demonstrate its support for Medicare Health Minister Greg Hunt says he and Mr Turnbull will review the Medicare rebate Labor first introduced the Medicare rebate freeze in 2013 as part of a $664 million budget savings plan \nSome Cabinet ministers believe the thaw is essential if the Coalition is to ensure the successful \"Mediscare\" campaign run by Labor in the weeks before the July election can never be repeated. \nCoalition strategists believe that campaign cost it several seats. \nOne minister told the ABC the Government needed to dramatically demonstrate its support for Medicare to inoculate it against future attacks. \nThe Prime Minister has admitted the Coalition's 2014 budget fuelled public fears about the Government's commitment to universal health care, by including plans like the ill-fated $7 co-payment for GP, pathology and imaging services. \nNew Health Minister Greg Hunt seems keen to strike a deal with Australian Medical Association (AMA) and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) to remove a key irritant in the Government's relationship with the powerful doctor's lobby. \nThis morning on the ABC's AM program he was asked whether any thawing of the Medicare rebate freeze could be on the cards in the May budget. \n\"The Prime Minister has said and I have said that is an item that we would be willing to review and we are willing to review subject to a very clear set of reforms that will help make the system stronger and better,\" he said. \nAMA President Dr Michael Gannon said he understands the overriding concern about balancing the budget.
