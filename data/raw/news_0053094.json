After they arrived, one boy decided instead to use a gun he had brought and shot the girl, prosecutors said Tuesday. \nThey took $55 from her purse, tossed her backpack in a trash bin and destroyed her cellphone and iPod, prosecutors wrote. The girl is in critical condition in a medically induced coma. \nOne teen told police that greed made them do it, investigators said. \nThe girl was reported missing Thursday evening when she didn't return home from school, and she was found early Friday in the dry canal in the town of Smithfield, about 90 miles north of Salt Lake City. \n\"She is in the fight of her life right now,\" said a spokeswoman for her family, Jill Parker. \nThe teen who brought the gun gave the spent shell casing to the other boy when he asked to keep it \"as a memento,\" the charges state. Officers later found it displayed on his bedroom windowsill. \nThe teen who took the casing home told police that he saw his friend shoot a girl he didn't know, though investigators say text messages between the boys indicate they planned the robbery and shooting together. \nThe boys were charged with six counts each, including attempted aggravated murder, robbery and obstruction of justice. \nThe Associated Press is not naming the defendants because they are juveniles. It was not immediately clear if they had attorneys, and no phone numbers were listed in public records for them. \nCache County Attorney James Swink said he wants to try the boys as adults. \n\"I haven't seen anything like this case in the 18 years I've worked in Cache County,\" he told reporters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:49:01.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
