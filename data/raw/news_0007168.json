Article continues below \nThe club hired the 34-year-old as their new boss on January 12, but because of a transfer embargo they've been unable to make any additions to their playing staff. \nHowever, the debts the club owed to HM Revenue & Customs have now been settled, meaning the Magpies are now able to sign players just in time for transfer deadline day, according to the BBC . Article continues below Kevin Nolan signs himself for Notts County \nCounty already signed one new face this week in the form of Blackpool winger Mark Yeats, but Nolan has registered himself as a player as well in order to shore up the club's midfielder. \nTaking to Twitter, County owner Alan Hardy confirmed that the former Newcastle and West Ham player had signed on to resume player-manager duties. \n\"KN has signed and will be the best centre midfielder in the league,\" he said. \nHardy also explained that he expected the club to be busy on transfer deadline day now that their embargo has been lifted. \nNolan, though, hasn't taken to the pitch since April when he left Orient. He made a total of 15 appearances for the club. \nCertainly, at 34 he may still have something to offer on the playing side, but it is a hilarious prospect to imagine him walking into training only to decide that he needed to sign himself in order to improve the club's fortunes. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
