It may cause an accident in politics anytime,\" he said at a programme on Friday. \nHis remarks came in response to BNP's comments on the new Chief Election Commissioner KM Nurul Huda. \nBNP Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi told a press brief on Wednesday that the new CEC was \"a spokesman of the Awami League.\" \nCondemning the statement, Obaidul, the road transport and bridges minister, said: \"BNP leaders, most of the time, don't know what they're talking about. \n\"Let me ask you (journalists), do you also think the CEC is a spokesperson for the ruling party ?\" \nThe leader attended the inaugural ceremony of 'Jubojagoron Library and Research Centre' organised by Dhaka South Juba League (youth wing of Awami League) on Friday. \nHe called upon those entering politics to get into the habit of reading books. \n\"An activist in politics needs to study and become competent. Otherwise they'll end up serving the leaders.\" \nIn a same call to leaders, he said: \"We have many great leaders but it is sad that they do not write books on their work life.\" \nThe minister said no political party would be allowed to hold rallies in the capital on working days. \n\"We do politics for people. In order to keep them free of hassles, we will hold indoor seminars on the upcoming three national days in March instead of rallies or mass gatherings.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T11:00:04.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
