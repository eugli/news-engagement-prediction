A 47-year-old Datuk was arrested in Puchong while a 30-year-old woman was nabbed in Kajang on Feb 8. \nSupt Mazelan said the couple had obtained a tender from the Defence Ministry to supply digital camouflage uniforms. \n\"To dupe their victims, they claimed that they did not have enough funds to fulfill the tender requirements and promised the investors returns of between 30% and 90% on their investments,\" he said. \nSupt Mazelan said that the police first knew of the group when a clerk from Terengganu lodged a police report claiming that she and 40 other investors were conned out of RM1.7mil on Sept 8, 2016. \n\"The clerk claimed that she had gathered the investors after hearing about the investment scheme from a third party. We launched our investigations before arresting the two suspects at a luxury apartment in Bukit Jelutong,\" he said. \nSupt Mazelan also said that the couple operated from a double-storey shoplot in Taman Melawati. \n\"The woman was a partner in the company and worked to find more investors while the Datuk received RM14mil to obtain a tender for a project for the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) Tower in Pahang,\" he said. \nSupt Mazelan said police also seized various documents, cheques, cheque books, four mobile phones and a Macbook. \n\"We also seized a Mercedes E250 and BMW 328GT from the suspects,\" he said adding that police were looking for eight vehicles believed to have been bought by the suspects under different names.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T11:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:28:46.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
