Mike Hewitt/Getty Images for Tottenham Hotspur FC \nTottenham star Kyle Walker is on a list of players prepared by Barcelona to fill the right-back spot next season. \nThe Spanish champions have not properly replaced Dani Alves since allowing the Brazilian to join Juventus last summer, and are determined to do so before next season. \nBarca have been studying the continent for candidates and Standard Sport understands Walker, 26, is one of the players they admire. \nHe is arguably having the best season of his Tottenham career. His rampaging runs from defence are one of Spurs’ most potent attacking weapons, bringing him five assists in the Premier League this season — an excellent return for a full-back. Vertonghen: Winks can be next Kane or Alli and become a Spurs star \nAs highly as Barcelona regard Walker, however, they know that prising him from Tottenham would be an expensive task. \nHaving tied Walker to a new five-year contract, worth about £70,000 a week, last year , Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is in no mood to let a prize asset walk away. \nReports this season suggested Manchester United and Manchester City were ready to offer £60million to sign Walker and Tottenham team-mate Danny Rose, who plays at left-back. It seems far likelier that Levy would demand at least that amount for just one of them. \nWalker is happy at Tottenham, where he has developed from a raw defender into an England regular and one of the best full-backs in the Premier League.

Only four points separate second-placed City from United in sixth, with Spurs, Arsenal and Liverpool also vying for the top four.
