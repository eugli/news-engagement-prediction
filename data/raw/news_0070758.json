This is the first time that a life expectancy has passed 90, the study's authors say. South Korean girls born in 2010 also had the highest life expectancy, at 84.07. Advertisement \nAustralian women are currently have the fourth longest life expectancy at 84.53. Girls born in 2030, the study says, can expect to live until they are 87.57, which is the sixth longest projected life span. \n\"As recently as the turn of the century, many researchers believed that life expectancy would never surpass 90 years,\" said lead author Professor Majid Ezzati from Imperial College London. \n\"Our predictions of increasing lifespans highlight our public health and healthcare successes. However, it is important that policies to support the growing older population are in place.\" \nProfessor David Le Couteur from the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney said: \"Three things struck me about this study. One is that much of this life expectancy gain is occurring in old people. Two is how well Australia is doing. And three is how badly the US is doing.\" \nProfessor Le Couteur said Australia's performance is due to a combination of lifestyle factors and social policy. \n\"There has been a dramatic reduction in smoking and enough people are exercising as they get older to make an impact. And while obesity is a problem it is not as bad as in the US or Britain. \n\"A strong conclusion of this study and one I would support is that having a strong universal health system with public health interventions makes a huge difference.\" \nHe said that in the US high homicide rates, obesity, inequality and the lack of universal healthcare are contributing to its stagnating life expectancy rates. \n\"The US spends more on health [per capita] than Australia but it's very inequitable in terms of delivery,\" Professor Le Couteur said. \n\"America is not even in the top 20 countries for life expectancy - which is incredible considering how much it spends on healthcare.\" \nThe study also shows that in every country - except Mexico - the gap in life expectancy between men and women is decreasing. \nFor Australians born in 2010, women are expected to live 4.43 years longer than men. However, for those born 20 years later, that gap is expected to drop to 3.57 years. \nIn the Netherlands the gender gap will drop to 1.7 years, with men born in 2030 expected to live until 83.69 and women until they are 85.39. \nProfessor Le Couteur said: \"I suspect countries with the narrowest difference between men and women have better social equity and lower smoking rates.\" \nHe said men are healthier and there is a tendency for women to be taking up some of the bad health behaviours of men, such as heavier drinking. \nAiliana Santosa, from the Centre for Demographic and Ageing Research, Umea University, Sweden said: \"Countries are moving towards universal health coverage. Achieving universal health coverage is worthy, plausible, and needs to be continued.\" \nThe researchers used a statistical method based on 21 models for 35 countries with populations above 1 million, rather than a single statistical model. These results were then combined using a Bayesian modelling technique. \nThe data for Australia compares well to recent data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics , which predicts life expectancy for Australian girls born in 2013-15 to be 84.5 and boys born at the same to time to live until they are 80.4. \n\"What these figures reflect is health. The reason people are living longer is because they're healthy. And because they are healthy they are contributing more to society and using less healthcare resources,\" Professor Le Couteur said.
