I know it sounds like a Diane Keaton movie (wasn't it one?) but she created a JDate profile for me and started chatting with guys and trying to find me a husband. She told me how she had found a cute artist type that I would like and gave him my email address. When he emailed me I immediately told him that he had been talking to my mother and that I wasn't looking for love, but I gave him my phone number anyway because I thought he was cute. Fast forward seven years later, and we're super married! \nDavid: I got reverse Catfished. When I went from an online chat with a Jewish mother to a phone call with a spunky ex riot girl at the tail end of her punk rock years the tone changed quite abruptly. I ended up with the cute 25-year-old NYC girl-about-town in spite of the fact that it was her mother in Boca Raton who was running the screening service. It set the tone for what was to be a fun and dynamic courtship where Lily and I both dove headlong into each other's eccentricities (and sometimes, each other's neuroses). \nLily: We weren't super into each other at first because we're basically polar opposites. Our first real date started at a karaoke bar and then we saw The Sadies play at Mercury Lounge. It was on that date that we realized that we had a similar sense of humor. At one point in the date he drew an engagement ring on my finger and I remember thinking, boy am I in trouble now. We met in late January and moved in together slash/announced our engagement in June. It was absolute madness and when I posted about our engagement on my Facebook all of my friends thought it was a prank. \nDavid: Lily went down to Florida and retrieved her great-grandmother's engagement ring. We took it with us to Union Square (the site of our first meet and greet) where we sat on a bench and I asked her to marry me. Unsurprised and unphased, Lily said yes. Illustration by David Ostow Sarah and Patrick Wayland, a Girl Scout troop leader and a self-proclaimed hedge found drop-out The Connecticut-based couple met at work in 2000 with help from an inter-office chat system and a co-worker's prank. \nSarah: I sat in a desk right behind Patrick, but because of the massive computer screens surrounding him I couldn't easily see his face. A day or two after I started, someone came on to the inter-office chat under an unrecognizable name and sent a few strange messages. It was slightly creepy, but nothing over the top. I wasn't sure who to ask about it and Patrick was head of the desk so I thought if one of the people on the desk were hazing the new girl, he'd probably be able to give me a nod if it happened often. I initiated a chat with him to feel it out. He found out who it was and it stopped. And, no, it wasn't him! From there, we started chatting every once in a while and found out that we had a lot in common. I came to find that there were more than a few instances of us just missing each other by a year or so and that was intriguing. I took a few walks back and forth from the office kitchen that day and from the glances I got between the computer screens, I could tell he was cute and the crush just got bigger from there. Later on we teased a few family and friends that we actually met on the internet which was a little nerve-wracking for them. But that was in 2000. Today it wouldn’t have the same satisfying jolt! \nPatrick: Our first date (I wasn't supposed to date her since she was a temp) was a trip to see The Exorcist remake. I invited the whole office to make it clear that it was not a date. She was late (as I later learned would always be the case), so I waited outside for her while the movie started. I was afraid she would blow it off but my heart skipped a beat when she finally came running through the doors into the theatre lobby. For our first official date I asked her out in a more honest capacity by suggesting we go to a tapas restaurant. She thought I said \"topless\" which quickly broke the ice. We went out for tapas and pool and I drove her to the local beach where we first kissed by moonlight. \nSarah: That evening my aunt was visiting which made me late. If I had a cell, I could have texted him, but for all I knew, he thought I ditched him and it could all end before it even began. I ran up the escalator at the entrance of the theatre and was about to sprint to the ticket booth. Later, I found out he had orchestrated the outing after I agreed to go. It was a good plan. \nPatrick: During our first month dating, I was already looking at places in the city where I could have a social life and have fun (in the spare hours of my round-the-clock crazy hedge fund job). I found a condo in the West Village and she moved in with me just three months after our first date. I had an engagement ring made for her six months later and was waiting for the opportunity to propose. \nSarah: We had only been dating for a year when we walked through Central Park Zoo on a gorgeous summer day and happened to be by Tiffany’s. We walked in to look around and though he asked me a few light questions about ring setting preferences, it was fun but I didn’t take it too seriously. That evening we went to the wedding of a close friend at the Pierre Hotel. We were dressed to the nines and after an incredible evening of dancing and celebrating, we decided to sneak away to celebrate our one year anniversary with a carriage ride through the park. Afterwards, we walked to the Pulitzer Fountain. As we came to the side of the fountain, he turned me around to tell me how much he loved me and took my hands to his chest to warm them, as he did often. I began to respond when I felt something cold and metallic in my hands and then he asked 'Will you marry me?' I really wasn’t expecting him to propose and my first reaction was to laugh and say 'You better not be kidding.' I opened my hands to see he ring and realized he was certainly not. 16 years and three kids later, I’m so glad I did.

When I arrived, the staff was reviewing the menu items they had tasted and I immediately noticed a young guy with a fauxhawk and a New York accent. \nBen: That night we were invited out to the same dinner by mutual friends, and her pursuit of the young, gun-for-hire from New York ensued. Courtesy Sara Leveen Advertisement Jamie and George Hess, founders of NYCFitFam TV journalist Joan Lunden's daughter Jamie and music industry vet George were introduced by Tracy Young, who DJed Madonna's wedding. \nJamie: Tracy actually introduced the idea of a blind date, but then she got busy with work, so I tracked George down online and reached out. I’m not scared of making the first move, and I think he liked that. \nGeorge: Some light chit chat produced a long list of what we had in common. At that point I felt I needed to lay everything out on the table. 'Hi, I'm 20 years older than you, have three kids, and so on.' I thought to myself 'I am going to go to the restroom, if she is still here when I get back, this is going to work.' In June that same year we were engaged. \nJamie: George started attending Barry’s Boot Camp with me. Barry’s is my temple, so it was no surprise that when the time came to propose a mere four months later, he did so after class on a Barry’s treadmill. My mom and sisters were all there to witness the surprise, which took place at the culmination of our daily 7:10am class (I was a sweaty mess). \nGeorge: The trainer had the ring in his pocket throughout the entire class. \nJamie: Now, five years into our relationship, he still holds doors, carries my bags and drops me curbside when it rains so I never have to ruin my hair in a storm. Courtesy Jamie Hess Teen style blogger Alexa Curtis and Andrew Danielson The couple met at their local grocery store when Alexa needed recipe advice. \nAlexa: I needed advice on lemon chicken and he was the first one to come up and answer the question. I went back the next day and he was there again, and I wrote my number on a piece of paper and gave him my number. I have never been so scared of something in my entire life. \nAndrew: The next day I was originally supposed to be off but ended up filling in for someone who was sick. I remember hoping that she would come in again. Sure enough, a couple hours into my shift she showed up again and this time bought a different friend to try the chicken. She told me she was telling everyone about this chicken and loved it so much she needed to have it again. \nAlexa: For our first date went to an amazing pizza restaurant. I was really nervous and the first thing he said to me was, 'Thank God you're not one of those gluten-free girls,' when I ordered the sausage pizza. I forced myself to eat it, but I'm actually gluten-free and super into health, and he almost ruined our chance of going on a second date! I told him then next time I saw him that I was pretty much gluten-free, and if he wanted to see me again, he'd have to go to the gym with me.
