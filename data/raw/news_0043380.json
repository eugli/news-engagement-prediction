But, boy, did they make a first impression. \nIn Travis Colyer (175cm), Orazio Fantasia (177cm), Josh Green (178cm) and Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti (171cm), the Bombers have one of the most exciting and dangerous small forward brigades in the competition. \nIt’s a contingent that could turn into coach John Worsfold’s most damaging and effective weapon in 2017. \n“It is a good little group, isn’t it?” Colyer told foxfooty.com.au . \n“I think having that flexibility going down forward and challenging teams will be good, not just in the air but on the ground.” Travis Colyer kicked two goals against Collingwood. Picture: Wayne Ludbey Source: News Corp Australia \nCollingwood certainly struggled to contain all four players — both offensively and defensively — during its JLT Community Series clash with the Bombers last Thursday night at Etihad Stadium. \nOf the 14 goals Essendon kicked for the night against the Pies, nine of them came from the mosquito fleet. Fantasia top-scored with four, while Green (two), Colyer (two) and McDonald-Tipungwuti (one) also contributed. \nThis group’s ability to hit the scoreboard will be crucial this season for the Dons, who were ranked 18th for scoring in 2016. \n“I actually said that to ‘Walla’ (McDonald-Tipungwuti) pre-game: Put pressure on, tackle and stick to what we know, but let’s kick goals because that’s the most fun part about playing forward,” Colyer said after the loss to the Pies. \n“I think we can put a lot of scoreboard pressure on and hopefully move up the scoring ladder after finishing lower down over recent years.” \nWhile they struggled to contain the four forwards, the Pies often found themselves trapped when trying to rebound the ball from defensive 50. \nOf the 11 tackles Essendon laid inside its forward arc, the mosquito fleet laid seven of them, led again by Fantasia (four). Josh Green laid five tackles against Collingwood.

It’s exciting,” Colyer said. \nBut perhaps the most exciting aspect to the mosquito fleet this year is that every member is a different type of player, even though they’re all forwards 178cm or shorter. \nGreen lands at the Bombers after a couple of successful seasons at the Brisbane Lions, where he twice topped the club’s goalkicking tally. He has the potential to kick upwards of 30 goals in 2017. \nColyer is quick, but probably has the best tank of the group. You’ll find him accumulating plenty of the footy in the middle or on a wing. \n“Colyer’s one of those players like Bradley Hill at Hawthorn now Fremantle, in that he runs all day and breaks the lines on the wing,” Essendon champion Matthew Lloyd told 3AW on Thursday. \nFantasia is a classy ball-user that not only knows how to find the goals, but also when to hit teammates that are in a better position to shoot. \n“He’s one of those players that you could play from half-back with his run and drive. But when you can kick 30 plus goals, you’ve got to play him in the forward line,” Lloyd said. Joe Daniher should get plenty of support from Orazio Fantasia and Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti in 2017.

Well, there’s simply no other player like him in the land. \nWhat he lacks in height he makes up for in leg speed, tackling intensity and superb ball use. \nAfter spending most of 2016 down back, McDonald-Tipungwuti is a more than handy addition to the forward line. \n“We are all actually different players ... guys have got different attributes to bring,” Colyer said. \n“You add Joe Daniher, James Stewart’s competitive nature, Shauny McKernan going down there and then to get ‘Hooksy’ (Cale Hooker) hopefully back — it’s really promising that forward line set-up. \n“It’s something we probably really haven’t had over the last couple of years, that real chemistry and lockdown six forwards each week.” \nAsked whether he could afford to play all four small forwards in the same side this season, Worsfold said after the Pies game: “Absolutely I am … I think we’ve got some really good options up there.” \nCue the Fred Flintstone sound effects. \nLive stream EVERY game of the JLT Community Series on FOX SPORTS.
