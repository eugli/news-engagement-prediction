(Photo: Cheryl Evans/azcentral sports) \n2 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Senior forward Kelsey Moos will return for the Arizona State women's basketball team for rivalry week after missing 12 games with injury.\nMost importantly with just four regular-season games and the Pac-12 Tournament remaining, ASU has a small window to convince the women's basketball selection committee that with Moos back, it still is deserving of being an NCAA Tournament first- and second-round host.\nThat requires being at least a No. 4 seed, where the Sun Devils stood when the committee gave a first look at its top-16 seeds Jan. 23, three weeks into Moos' injury. Now, ESPN bracketology projects ASU as a No. 7 seed playing in an NCAA sub-regional at No. 2-seed Texas.\nASU hosted in 2015, reaching the Sweet 16, and in 2016, losing in the second round to Tennessee.\nMORE: No. 23 Arizona State women edge Washington State \n\"We can’t waste any more time,\" Moos said. \"We have to go now. We’ve got to kick it into gear to have the season we want in the end.\"\nCoach Charli Turner Thorne said she will immediately reinsert Moos, a 6-foot senior guard/forward, as a starter at Arizona (12-13, 3-11) on Friday, likely shifting freshman Robbi Ryan back into a reserve role. Moos averages 5.2 points and 5.8 rebounds while shooting 36.7 percent from 3-point and 92.9 percent on free throws.\n\"She’s just smart and sees the game,\" Turner Thorne said. \"She’s been shooting the crud out of the ball. We had one veteran guard and lost her for 80 percent of the conference season and now we’re getting her back, we’re going to be a better team. It is going to take a little bit of time. There is still some working it out, but she looked darn good (in practice Wednesday).\"\nMoos always has contributed more than box-score statistics because of her toughness and defense. She's not overly concerned about her conditioning while acknowledging \"biking is completely different than basketball shape. I’m just excited to be playing again. Honestly, the condition will probably be the last thing on my mind because I’m just so excited to be out there that I’m not going to let fatigue slow me down. I’m not going to let this injury set me back.\" She said hustle plays are \"a huge part of my game. That’s the only way I know how to play. That’s not going to change.\"\nShe sees her role as \"being a really aggressive offensive player, having my shot ready to go. Other than that, bringing an intensity on defense that kind of helps set the consistent standard we have in our program. Any way I can help out with that I will, then rebounding as well and get back on the boards.\"\nGET THE ASU APP: iPhone | Android \nFriday's game Arizona State at Arizona When: 7 p.m. \nWhere: McKale Center, Tucson. \nTV/Radio: Pac-12 Network/ KDUS-AM (1060). \nASU: The Sun Devils split last week, beating Washington State 61-58 and losing 70-57 to No. 9 Washington. They play Arizona again at home at 4 p.m. Sunday. ASU has won 21 of the past 23 rivalry games since 2006, including four straight (Arizona's last win was in 2014). \"I have great respect for that entire coaching staff,\" ASU coach Charli Turner Thorne said. \"They’re doing a great job, and they’re better than they were last year. They’re in every game, winning some games, which ultimately except for these two games a year is phenomenal for us because we want to have a great (Pac-12) travel partner. I’d rather have a brutal rivalry game and have them beat other teams.\" \nArizona: The Wildcats broke a seven-game losing streak last week with a 70-62 win at Washington State, rebounding from a 91-55 loss to Washington. F LaBrittney Jones is averaging 14.8 points and 6.9 rebounds and G Malena Washington 12.6 points and 3.0 assists. The two seniors have scored 42 points of UA's points. First-year coach Adia Barnes is back at her alma mater, where she played from 1995-98 and became the school career scoring leader with 2,237 points. Her husband Salvo Coppa is one of her assistants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:44:50.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
