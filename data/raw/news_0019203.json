Or maybe he's just showing some old-fashioned compassion for his old mate. \nThe television ratings should be strong and the spotlight will be squarely on the two superstars. According to NewsOK.com , tickets are averaging $405 apiece for the game. \nBut you can understand Westbrook's desire to bury the story as much as possible. Besides, the teams have already played twice in Golden State (Durant scored 39 points and then 40 in blowout victories). \nThe Thunder are currently sitting in seventh place in the Western Conference playoff race with ground to catch up to get back to the middle of the pack. \nThat's big because a seventh-seed probably means a first-round series with San Antonio, a big problem for anyone. \nOr, even worse, another rematch with an old friend if the Spurs overtake the Warriors for the top seed. \nNow wouldn't that be something?
