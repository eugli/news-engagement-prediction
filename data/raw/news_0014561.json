It is not clear how many asylum applicants would be processed in the camps, or whether the EU will sanction the plan. \nHungary has repeatedly clashed with the EU over its migration policy, including its decision to erect a fence on its Serbian border and its refusal to accept EU-wide asylum quotas. \nKovács said he expected a further clash with Brussels over the new asylum plan, but insisted the current arrangements were being abused systematically, since asylum applicants were currently free to move while waiting for the appeal of a rejected application. He said many on appeal absconded to other countries such as Germany and the UK . “If we maintain the existing regime, we are not able to control what is happening at the borders or within Europe ,” he added. \nKovács said that although the applicants would not be be allowed to move freely in the country, the camps should not be described as “detention centres”. \n“We do not have a proper term yet for it – that is the challenge task to formulate. It is not about detention, it is about not giving the same opportunity for them as provided to European citizens. Do not be mistaken. There is a systematic abuse of that within Europe. The name of the game today is illegal migration. Everybody who comes to the EU as a migrant basically comes here illegally.” \nHe claimed that over the weekend Hungarian officials had arrested 100 asylum seekers who were in the country illegally. \nThe conditions in existing Hungarian refugee camps have been severely criticised by human rights groups such as Amnesty International, but Kovács said access to the revised detention centres could not be provided to the media under EU rules. \nHe promised the shelters would provide food and education for children, including unaccompanied children, saying: “The shelters will meet all the required EU standards.” \nKovács said Hungary “will use all means at our disposal to check identity and have a very thorough investigation of each and every case. In line with international law, we do not believe just because someone comes from Syria and there is a civil war, it should entitle groups of people to come to the European Union , especially as they will have crossed many safe countries on the way.” Libya may allow EU ships to pursue people-smugglers in its waters Read more \nHungary has set up border fences with Serbia and plans to employ between 6,000 to 8,000 border guards “to apprehend those coming through the fence”. \nKovács claimed the EU summit in Malta was a turning point, and said the EU was taking up proposals put forward by Hungary in 2015. \nHe said when Orbán had proposed hotspots and camps be set up in north Africa, he had been denounced as a provocateur, but now his proposals were on the agenda of the EU. “What was denounced as utopian or insane is now starting to rule the agenda.” \nWith Orbán slated as one of the first European Union leaders likely to meet Trump when he comes to Europe for a Nato summit in May, Kovács added: “We believe a change of perspective in the US helped others to respect the Hungarian position.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:22:55.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
