She spoke in the local Shona language. \nMugabe, who turns 93 tomorrow, has slowed down on public engagements while his 51-year-old wife has become increasingly visible in politics. \nMugabe has been in power since white minority rule ended in Zimbabwe in 1980 after years of war. A big celebration for him is planned on February 25, a few days after his birthday. \nGrace Mugabe warned associates of Mugabe from the guerrilla war era that they cannot take power because they also are old. \n\"Anyone who was with Mugabe in 1980 has no right to tell him he is old. If you want Mugabe to go, then you leave together. Then we take over because we were not there in 1980,\" she said, pointing to herself. \nMugabe has declared he wants to live until 100 and rule for life and complained about party factions jostling to replace him.
