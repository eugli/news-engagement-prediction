The investment contract has been signed for nine years. The launch is scheduled for 2019; the plant's production capacity will be over 20,000 cars a year. The project will create more than a thousand jobs,\" Minpromtorg said in a statement. \nRussia will contribute to the project by giving government support and will offer a favorable tax environment, the ministry added. \nThe plant will be built by the newly-created Mercedes-Benz Manufacturing RUS (MBMR) division. \n“Russia is a strategically important and rapidly developing market for Mercedes-Benz,\" said Mercedes-Benz Cars board member Markus Schäfer. He added that the localization of production will make the company more competitive in the global market. \nMinpromtorg deputy head Aleksandr Morozov said the German car producer is investing in Russia despite the short-term deterioration of relations between Moscow and the European Union. \nThe agreement to build the plant was signed last year during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum (SPIEF). Daimler will start building it next year. \nDaimler has long had plans to build a car assembly plant in Russia.
