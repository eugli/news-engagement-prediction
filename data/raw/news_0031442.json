Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.) Saturday morning, a Florida GOP executive chided protesters who continually interrupted the event.\nWhen Pasco County GOP secretary Bill Akins got on stage to speak about the failings of Obamacare, claiming that elderly people go before “death panels” because of the law, the crowd erupted into screams and boos — but Atkins wasn’t having any of it.\n“They do. Yes, they do. It’s in there folks. You’re wrong,” Akins can be heard saying over the noise.\n“OK, children. Alright, children,” he added, mocking the rowdy crowd.\nCNN got video of the incident.\nWATCH: At Congressman @RepGusBilirakis town hall – County GOP Chairman Bill Akins refers to adults as \"children\" when they fact check him. pic.twitter.com/RcaOz0gNOY \n— Yashar (@yashar) February 11, 2017 \n\nPrior to Obamacare becoming law in 2010 and directly afterward, one of the biggest claims Republican used in their opposition to the law was arguing that the law effectively created “death panels” that would ration health care and not provide adequate care to elderly Americans.\nPolitiFact labeled the claim their “lie of the year” in 2009, despite the fact that rationing of health care exists in countries with socialized, single-payer health care systems similar to those Democrats want to implement.\nAfter the town hall, Rep. Bilirakis responded to the incident saying that he is holding town halls to hear the concerns of his constituents.\nIt's my duty to hear you out, even if we may disagree. I want today's town hall to be constructive and I want to find common ground. https://t.co/6p5xMwz7Oy \n— Gus Bilirakis (@RepGusBilirakis) February 11, 2017 \n\nIn 09 Dems passed ACA w/o listening to the people first. Held town halls after it became law. I want to do it differently & gather input now pic.twitter.com/6UnwwZa3M8 \n— Gus Bilirakis (@RepGusBilirakis) February 11, 2017 \n\nDemocrats are becoming increasingly testy at town halls across the nation, similar to what the tea party did in 2009 and 2010. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) faced brutal opposition and protests at a town hall earlier this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:39:27.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
