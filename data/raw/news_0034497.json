Several paw impressions were also left behind during a recent snowfall. \nWhile there could be more than one cougar, conservation officers are focused on one in particular. \nDog owners are being advised to keep their pets on a leash and those with young children are also being urged to stay cautious. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
