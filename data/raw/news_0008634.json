But after medics assessed the couple, they vetoed their marriage, warning that they will not be able to cope with living on their own.\nInstead, as part of an initiative called the ‘Project of Dreams’ the couple exchanged engagement rings in a betrothal service organised by volunteers.\nView photos\nLove at first sight – the couple want to get married and live together, but have had to settle for a lavish engagement ceremony (Pictures: Caters) More Volunteer Fabiane Zaffalon said: “As they couldn’t get married we came up with another way to make their dreams come true by holding an engagement ceremony at the retirement home.”\nThe special event was lavishly decorated with a four-tier cake, flowers, cupid ornaments and scattered rose petals. Valda, who wore a white dress, pearls around her neck and comfortable slippers, walked down the aisle with her Zimmer-frame decorated with roses.\nMORE: Kylie Minogue CONFIRMS split from fiancé Joshua Sasse on Instagram\nMORE: TV programme reveals moment when Terry Pratchett realised he was ‘dead’\nAfter a short message and prayer, the happy couple said “yes” to stay loyal to each other and exchanged engagement rings in front of 150 guests.\nIt’s the first time both Valda and Jaco have been engaged. Neither of them have children and most of Valda’s relatives have died while Jaco has lost touch with his family.\nView photos\nHappy – Valda has never been engaged before – neither has Jaco More The lovestruck pair met at the residential home in 2014 and it was love at first sight for Jaco, who has been living in the home for 19 years.\nHe said: “I fell in love with Valda from the moment I saw her. I know she’s a little older than me, but that doesn’t matter because she makes me really happy.”\nThe couple are inseparable and spend all day with each other, chatting, eating their meals together and sitting side by side in the home.\nSpeaking of her love for Jaco, Valda said: “If he dies, I die too. I know it’s not going to happen but I would have loved to be able to wash Jaco’s clothes, cook his meals and look after him like a wife.”", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TocEtB3HyhKENqrqtRpRSg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9MTAzNQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/e4ac7d8eceb50fb7eecc304d36ed0d54);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jlmVpEylkdX6cXU9BM2aJQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NDkz/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/fa60ae66b2f7853b1da23dd9d04dbe44", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TocEtB3HyhKENqrqtRpRSg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9MTAzNQ--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/e4ac7d8eceb50fb7eecc304d36ed0d54", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/G_i2zktPOu6iGn1tJFtdTw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NDkz/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/783f956bb81350cc39b0725d813e21d9", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jlmVpEylkdX6cXU9BM2aJQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NDkz/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/fa60ae66b2f7853b1da23dd9d04dbe44);", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150604/orb.png);"], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:40:20.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
