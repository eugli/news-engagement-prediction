The public does not care for u or ur child, it's no wonder u did this to be relevant!!!! Wow can't even come up with ur own style had to copy it!!!! What a joke!!! I'd feel embarrassed if I was u\" [sic]\nAnother said: \"\"Inspired\"? You mean copied to the T, right?\"\n\"Good job copying Beyoncé. Sucks you can't have your own originality.

Everyone really needs to get back to their lifes. She didn't steal and say it was her own, clearly the photographer picks the shoot and anyway she's clearly credited beyonce. It's nothing to do with race. Racism does exist, but taking a picture like someone else did to announce a pregnancy is not racism in the slightest. Calling a pregnant woman viscous and disgusting names because she took a picture makes you the ignorant person. Stupid people make my head hurt!\" [sic]\n\"Great news! Congratulations Danielle, you deserve to be happy,\" commented another fan.\nAnd another said: \"What a vile bunch of trolls!
