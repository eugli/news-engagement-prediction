Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible.\" \nJournalists have been at a loss to find any specific incident taking place on Friday night - but that didn't stop Twitter having a joke at Trump's expense. Twitter suitably ridiculed Trump for his false claim (Photo: Getty) \nThe billionaire's baffling comments spawned the spoof hashtags #JeSuisIKEA and #IStandWithSweden while users checked on the safety of ABBA. \nSweden's security service told Aftonbladet there was no change to the threat level, and former PM Carl Bildt fumed: \"Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking?\" \nTrump later claimed his comments referred to a Fox News feature about Sweden that was screened on Friday night. \nThe feature contained allegations the Swedish government was trying to cover up a surge in crime including rapes since the refugee crisis. However, this was not a specific incident that look place on Friday night.

Who would believe this? Sweden! They took in large numbers, they’re having problems like they never thought possible. \n\"You look at what’s happening in Brussels. You look at what’s happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris.
