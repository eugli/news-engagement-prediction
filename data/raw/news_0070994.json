Flynn has overseen the department since 2008.\n“As a brother or black man living in Milwaukee, it's not an unusual thing,\" Collin told Reason. \"When I leave my home, I leave with apprehension. Not that it's in your face, but it's there. I feel there's a good possibility that I'll get shot or pulled over.”\nMilwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn has led the Milwaukee Police Department since 2008.

He claims he has been stopped by Milwaukee cops three times -- once as a 5th grader, again in 7th grade and most recently while walking to his high school. The lawsuit, expected to be filed as early as Wednesday morning, will detail a pattern of abuse with its \"high-volume, suspicionless stop-and-frisk program,\" court documents state. The city has already faced dozens of lawsuits challenging police tactic.\nThe lawsuit comes on the heel of the ACLU scoring a large round of donations while battling the Trump administration's travel ban. Its attorneys will claim that Milwaukee's policy violates Title VI civil rights, the Fourteenth Amendment and Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\nNew York City has led the way in bringing down stop-and-frisk practices.\nIn 2013, a federal judge found the NYPD’s use of stop-and-frisk in predominantly black and Latino communities unconstitutional. Cops have conducted more than five million impromptu street interrogations since 2002, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union.\nAngry crowds took to the streets for two nights to protest an officer-involved killing in Milwaukee in 2016.  (Darren Hauck/Getty Images) The ACLU lawsuit will allege that Milwaukee’s use of the NYPD’s CompStat to monitor crime statistics has fueled a quota among officers, according to Reason.\nHigh-profile minority deaths, such as Eric Garner in NYC and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., at the hands of law enforcement has created a heightened awareness of police abuse of power and sparked the Black Lives Matter movement.\nA police shooting in Milwaukee sparked two nights of violent unrest in 2016.\nFormer police officer Dominique Heaggan-Brown fatally shot the gun-toting Sylville Smith, 23, after he fled traffic stop. The rookie cop was fired from the Milwaukee department following sexual assault claims. A man told police Heaggan-Brown raped him after a drunken night at a bar, watching the fiery riots on TV.\nHe was later charged with reckless homicide in Smith's death. He allegedly fired the fatal shots after Smith was disarmed.  \nSend a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:25:46.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
