This is the worst form of state intimidation and this is not how democracies and democratic countries function. It is extremely unfortunate and highly reprehensible. Needs to be condemned in the strongest terms that an alternative point of view, if not liked or accepted, will be met by state intimidation and state sponsored violence whether it is in the real or virtual world,” Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari told reporters. \nRamjas violence \nMr. Tewari was replying to a query about rape threats issued to Gurmehar Kaur, who is the daughter of a Kargil martyr, after she condemned the ABVP for violence at Ramjas College here. \nReacting to BJP Mysuru MP Pratap Simha’s remarks against her, he said, “Such a gentleman certainly does not deserve to be in Parliament. Someone who has no respect for the families of martyrs...for the pain of a young lady who grew up without a father because her father laid down his life to protect the unity and integrity of the country... Such a gentleman definitely has no right to sit in the highest seat of Indian democracy.” \nMr. Tewari said that unfortunately this was an ethos which had become intrinsic to the BJP because it flowed from the top. \n“Fascist culture” \n“When you have the Prime Minister of India referring to the media as ‘bazaaru’, ministers referring journalists as ’presstitutes’, front organisations of the RSS and BJP perpetrating violence then obviously their MPs also feel that possibly by insulting the family members of Kargil martyrs, they may also find a place in Modi’s Cabinet,” he said. \nOn Mr. Rijiju’s remarks, Mr. Tewari said, “This is an example of fascist culture. She is just not anybody. She is the daughter of a Kargil martyr. Her family understands the meaning of sacrifice. If she condemns violence and you treat her like that... it is a perfect example of fascist mindset.” \nThe Congress tweeted, “When a woman thinks independently, patriarchal BJP thinks her mind is polluted. \nWhen a person ‘bats’ for peace, BJP responds with hate (sic).” \n“We admire Gurmehar Kaur’s courage to stand up against bullies & threats and to fight for Rights of her fellow students. Fascists always fall in the mud & remain there when brave Indians like Gurmehar Kaur chose to fight for peace and not give in to hate (sic),” it said. \nCongress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also took to Twitter and said, “Speaking the ‘truth’ is now ‘pollution’. New normal by Modiji’s ministers. No wonder the ABVP now stands for ‘Aao Bhaiya Vidyarthee Peetein’” \n“Rape threat to a 20-year old student and Kargil martyr’s daughter is BJP-ABVP brand of ‘nationalism’ Ghastly and horrific (sic),” he tweeted. \n“Anti-national” \nEarlier in the day, Mr. Simha tweeted, “At least Dawood did not use the crutches of his father’s name to justify his anti-national stand.” \nAfter Kaur’s campaign went viral online with her photograph in which she said, “Pakistan did not kill my father. War killed him”, Simha also posted a photograph showing Dawood with the message, “I didn’t kill people in 1993. Bombs killed them.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:20:59.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
