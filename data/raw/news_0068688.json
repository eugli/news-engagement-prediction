The track, a soulful pop tune in its original form, has powered into clubland via remixes from Dave Aude, Ivan Gomez and DJ Deville, among others. \n\"I'm so happy the message of 'Long Live Love' connected and people are dancing to it,\" Rimes tells Billboard of the track that she co-authored with Darrell Brown and Mark Batson. \"We wrote the song to speak to our need for love. So, I appreciate the love from the dance world. And, of course, I love collaborating with the best of the best! I am honored to be a part of it all.\" \n\"Love\" is from Rimes' new album Remnants , which debuted on the Feb. 25-dated Top Album Sales chart at No. 28. She first ruled Dance Club Songs since \"What I Cannot Change\" on Feb. 28, 2009 (after first establishing herself, at 14, as a force in country music with her debut hit \"Blue\" in 1996). \n\"Love\" is Rimes' fourth top 10 and eighth Dance Club Songs hit, dating back 16 years to her first entry, \"Can't Fight the Moonlight\" (No. 17, 2001). Her next track to chart, \"Tic Toc,\" became her first top 10, clocking a No. 10 peak in 2003. Rimes also reached the top 10 with \"Nothin' Better to Do\" (No. 8, 2008).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:42:04.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
