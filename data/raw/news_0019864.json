Now another storm is headed for the region, threatening to bring even more powder and travel chaos for a region that has been mostly untouched by extreme weather this winter. Forecasters say a smaller storm will bring snow to the Great Lakes and New England Friday night into Saturday. Scroll down for video A small smattering of one to two three inches of snow is expected in the northern Great Lakes and New England Friday night The Friday system is set to be followed by a larger storm that will stretch from Sunday afternoon to Monday night While New York City and Philadelphia will see a wintery mix, conditions will be cold enough in Boston for more snow and possible blizzard conditions in the coast regions But that's just the precursor for an even larger storm that's looming large over the Monday morning commute. The first clipper system starts tonight and is set to bring one to three inches of snow to the northern Great Lakes region, upstate New York and New England by Saturday afternoon. After a break Saturday evening, a new - more potent - system will move in. Temperatures will remain below freezing Friday night, making it all but impossible for Northeasterners to shovel out of the Thursday storm Warmer temperatures on Sunday will likely shield New York City from more snow accumulation with the second storm By Monday, the second storm will be firmly in New England territory The second starts Sunday afternoon and will last through Monday evening. 'At this time, it appears that the I-95 corridor from Boston to Portland and Bangor, Maine, will bear the brunt of the storm,' Accuweather Meteorologist Kyle Elliott said. Elliott says that some areas could see over a foot of snow.
