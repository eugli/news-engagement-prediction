South Africa withdrew in 1961 when it became apparent its membership application on becoming a republic would be rejected. It re-joined after democratic elections in 1994. \nPakistan left in 1972 after the recognition of Bangladesh but returned after elections in 1989. Fiji’s membership lapes in 1987 after a military coup, but the country returned in 1997. \nAdama Barrow, the new Gambian president Credit: AFP PHOTO / SEYLLOUSEYLLOU/AFP/Getty Images M r Johnson’s trip to Gambia is also the first time a British Foreign Secretary has visited the country, according to government records. \nHe will meet President Barrow and President Akufo-Addo of Ghana and praise the impact of recent elections as proof of the “continuing strengthening of democracy in West Africa”. \nMr Johnson expressed his belief in the Commonwealth within months of taking office when the Maldives announced it would be leaving. \n“We believe in the Commonwealth and its commitment to improving the lives of people across all its member states,” Mr Johnson said last October. \n“The Commonwealth is an organisation dedicated to developing free and democratic societies, and to promoting peace and prosperity.”\nEurosceptics repeatedly argued that Britain leaving the EU could help forge greater links with the Commonwealth during the referendum campaign. \nLeading Leave figures have also argued that citizens of Commonwealth countries should be given more favourable rights to move to Britain after it leaves the EU.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:15:26.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
