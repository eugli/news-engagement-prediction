Ben Martin reports: \nLloyds Bank posted its biggest annual profits in a decade after the lender took a smaller hit from the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal, in a sign the company has almost recovered from its near-collapse during the financial crisis. \nPre-tax profits jumped to £4.2bn from £1.6bn in 2015 after provisions for PPI compensation dropped to £1bn, compared with £4bn a year earlier. The taxpayer’s stake in the bank has now fallen to less than 5pc, from 43pc following its bailout at the height of the crisis, and the Government is on course to return the business to full private ownership by May. Lloyds share price \n“The group’s performance demonstrates that our simple, low-risk, UK-focused, multi-branded model continues to be a source of competitive advantage,” said Lloyds boss Antonio Horta-Osorio. \nL loyds' total bill for the PPI scandal is about £17bn, the biggest of any British bank. However, the drop in provisions last year signals that the lender has almost put the controversy behind it. 8:35AM European shares hit 14-month high buoyed by upbeat corporate earnings \nU pbeat corporate earnings from Lloyds, Scor and Telefonica Deutschland lifted European shares to a 14-month high this morning. \nHere's a snapshot of the current state of play: Credit: Reuters \nMike van Dulken, of Accendo Markets, ​said: \"Calls for a firm open come after US bourses posted a solid return from a long weekend.

Investors will be eyeing the numbers for signs of a fall-off in business investment six months after the Brexit vote. \nForecasts suggest the second estimate of UK Q4 GDP are unchanged at 0.6pc quarter-on-quarter for a third consecutive quarter and 2.2pc year-on-year. \nPreviewing the release, Michael Hewson, of CMC Markets , said: \"This effect is expected to be illustrated by today’s second iteration of Q4 GDP which is expected to be reconfirmed at 0.6pc, and an annualised 2.2pc. \n\"More importantly the weakness of the pound is expected to help exports contribute 2pc, while imports are expected to fall from 1.4pc to 0.5pc. Services are still expected to provide the majority of the expansion at 0.8pc, though a little worryingly business investment is expected to stall.\" Looking ahead, highlights include FOMC meeting minutes, UK GDP, Eurozone inflation alongside API crude oil inventory reports — RANsquawk (@RANsquawk) February 22, 2017 \nE lsewhere, we get the latest IFO survey of German confidence at 9am and a flash estimate of eurozone inflation for this month at 10am. \nAt 9am, the latest IFO survey of German confidence is released - showing how firms in Europe’s largest economy feel about current conditions, and future prospects. \nWe finish the day with the release of the minutes from the Fed's FOMC January meeting.
