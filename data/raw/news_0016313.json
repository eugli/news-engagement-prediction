Swar Shoaib is a popular Arab show which is shot in Kuwait and is hosted by Shoaib Rashid. \nSporting a navy blue, patterned dress, the actress spoke to the popular host Shoaib Rashid about how paparazzi snapped a photo of her holding Quran in New York City in 2015, which went viral. Lindsay with the Quran. Photo courtesy: Twitter \n\"My intention wasn't to hold a religious book. I was just holding a religious book, but people in America didn't like it, they judged me for it and were saying nasty things. (The Quran was) a solace and a safe thing for me to have,\" Lohan said. \nIn the interview she further elaborated on how she has started praying the Islamic way and has fasted during the Ramadan month. \"I did Ramadan for three days with my friend from Kuwait, it was hard but it was good. It felt good,\" she said. \nThe actress said she has read 15 pages from the Holy Quran in English and that she practices writing some of the verses in Arabic as well. \"I also listen to the Quran on my phone, I have an App.\" she added. \n\"Do you feel something special when you read it?\" Rashid asked. \n\"I feel calmness,\" Lohan said. \nThough Lohan neither confirmed nor denied converting to Islam in the interview; she has scrubbed of her entire social media presence and left an Arabic greeting 'Alaikum salam,' that translates to 'and unto you peace.' \nThis greeting falls under the umbrella of proper Islamic etiquette, leading many believers to assume that Lohan has embraced the faith. \nLohan has also put up a photo of her time with Rashid: A photo posted by Lindsay Lohan (@lindsaylohan) on Feb 5, 2017 at 7:33pm PST \nThere were a few fun, light moments in the show too. Rashid managed to get Lohan to eat rice with her hands. The interview ended on a funy note when Rashid concluded with, \"Thank you, Lindsay, see you in heaven, soon Insha'Allah.\" \nLohan retorted with, \"Hope not like soon enough.\" \n(Skip to 18:20 in the video for Lohan's interview segment.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:36:42.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
