It is a simple and effective program that facilitates the text communication and file exchange. The application features an easy to use interface that displays the list of users from the network and provides quick access to the received files folder. You can also browse the recent message history for all the users with just one click. The messenger users can be organized into groups in order to easily find the person that you need to chat with. The program is able to export and import the group parameters which makes it easier to use the same parameters for all the members of an organization. This app also allows you to communicate with multiple persons at the same time by inviting other users or entire groups to an ongoing conversation. You can also make announcements by sending the same message to multiple users at the same time. While the casual users can be satisfied with the basic communication features of the Softros LAN Messenger, some network administrators might require additional features such as user rights management or remote assistance support. Unfortunately, the application is pretty straight-forward and offers only basic communication features. However, this approach makes the program easy to understand and enables any user to start chatting immediately after installation. Another advantage of the simple interface is the small footprint of the program. It requires insignificant resources and can easily be run on older computers with various operating systems. If you are not looking for advanced features and the emoticon support is not very important for you, the Softros LAN Messenger is a reliable solution for enabling the text messaging between all the network computers.
