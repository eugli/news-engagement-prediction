Ohio Players confirmed his passing on their official Facebook page. A cause of death has not yet been revealed. Best known as the keyboardist and vocalist for Ohio Players, Morrison also served as musical director for Parliament/Funkadelic during the late ’70s. George Clinton is said to have called him “the most phenomenal musician on the planet.” In 1997, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with Funkadelic. Morrison also released several solo albums. His final record, When the City , came out in 2004. \nIn 2015, Morrison contributed to Dâm-Funk’s album Invite the Light . The producer took to Twitter to pay respects to him, calling him “‘my’ King of #FUNK.” Last year, Solange included the Morrison-inspired track “ Junie ” on A Seat at the Table . In an interview , Morrison said of the honor, “I was a bit taken aback by the surprise but very appreciative that she wanted to put time and energy into creating it.” He added, “Suffice it to say, I was like, WHAAAT???!!! ” A post shared by Questlove Gomez (@questlove) on Feb 16, 2017 at 10:01am PST RIP the unheralded JUNIE MORRISON https://t.co/R61DyeKPvS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:02:14.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
