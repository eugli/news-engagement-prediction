The Joanne singer is following up her electrifying Super Bowl LI halftime show performance by collaborating with Metallica this Sunday at the annual music awards show, and if her past appearances are any indication, we should expect her to go bold. In the meantime, Gaga's upcoming performance has us thinking of all the times the eccentric artist has totally stolen the show on music's biggest night. Here now are Lady Gaga's nine best GRAMMY moments. 1. When she arrived in an egg... Photo: Getty Images Gaga's red carpet game has certainly toned down a bit over the years, but it's kinda hard to outdo herself when one of her earliest GRAMMY fashion statements literally involved incubation. The pop star let us all know we should feel OK about being \"Born This Way,\" though it's clear that no one was born quite like Mother Monster! 2. And then hatched out of it to slay \"Born This Way.\" Say what you will about her over-the-top style, but what Gaga's unmatched commitment invariably leads to is big ideas, and oftentimes, incredible shows, such as this performance of her sophomore album's eponymous anthem at the 2011 GRAMMYs. 3. Her look that literally could have possibly killed.

Fashion may always win the battle over function in Gaga's wardrobe, but we love her all the more for it. 4. When she used half of Optimus Prime's head as a hat.

And lest we think she's all spectacle, Gaga's duet with Tony Bennett at the 2015 GRAMMYs showed that even when she's understated, she's a venerated talent on the mic. 6. Her David Bowie tribute. When the world lost David Bowie in January 2016, it was clear that a true icon had left us all. And while no one can truly embody the late superstar's essence, Gaga proved she honors it deeply with her moving, animated tribute performance. 7. As well as her red carpet look that night. You could probably say this with many of her fashions and ventures, but exclusive footage obtained by ET shows just how much work Marc Jacobs put into Gaga's Bowie homage-ing wardrobe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:15:31.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
