The maximum penalty for misconduct is seven years. \nTsang showed little emotion as the sentence was read out in a packed courtroom. \nChan noted that among Tsang’s major contributions to public service, one that stood out was “his effort in overcoming” the 1997—98 Asian financial crisis. Tsang, who was financial secretary at the time, led the city’s successful multibillion—dollar defense of its currency peg against speculators. \nA jury found Tsang guilty last week of one count of misconduct in public office but not guilty on a second count. His wife, Selina Tsang, told reporters outside court that she and other family members were “disappointed and heartbroken” at the sentence and that they plan to appeal. \nIt’s one of several cases in recent years that have shaken public confidence and raised concerns about cozy ties between Hong Kong’s leaders and wealthy tycoons. \nJurors ruled 8—1 that he committed misconduct when he failed to disclose that the penthouse in neighboring Shenzhen in mainland China was owned by a businessman whose company was applying for a digital radio license. \nThey unanimously cleared him of the second misconduct charge, which alleged he failed to reveal he had nominated for an award an interior designer working on the penthouse’s renovations. \nThe jury couldn’t decide on a third charge of accepting an advantage. A retrial is tentatively scheduled for September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:29:33.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
