They all went off to university. Couldn’t go back see friends at weekend as used to. We followed them through their first year.\n\"We looked at what happened to the original set of friendships - they deteriorate really rapidly over a matter of months. The churn was phenomenal. Forty per turnover every six months.\n\"What determined with original friendships whether they survived with girls was whether they made effort to talk more to each other on the phone.\n\"The telephone was only of any use to the girls though. Talking had absolutely no effect on boys’ relationships at all. What held up their friendships was doing stuff together. Going to a football match, going to the pub for a drink, playing five a side. They had to make the effort.\"\nProf Dunbar said there was a \"very striking sex difference\" between men and women's social groups.\n\"Women clearly have much more intense close friendships,\" he said. \"They’re very intense, very like romantic relationships - in the sense if they break they break catastrophically.\n\"Guys tend not to have that relationship. They tend to have a group of four guys that they do stuff with. That is much more casual.\n\"If you move away to another town, girls will be on the phone or Facebook with each other to keep the relationship going. With guys it is out of sight out of mind. They just find four more guys to go drinking with.\"\nThe cast of Channel 4's university-themed sitcom Fresh Meat Credit: Channel 4 P rof Dunbar also said that having too many friends could make women more stressed and even impact fertility.\nHowever, having five close female friends could cancel out the effect.\n\"The stresses you incur destabilise the menstrual system endocrinology and very quickly lead to infertility,\" he said.\n\"Women's infertility is heavily driven by social stresses.\n\"It’s the number of people bumping into you. It’s the commuter problem - they’re not attacking you in the underground, they’re just crowding you. It’s social stresses\n“There is a suggestion that your core friends – the shoulder to cry on friends – can bolster your fertility.\n“A core of five best friends are crucial in buffering you against the stress of other people.\n“If you do not have these friends, you are more likely to have your menstrual cycle and endocrinology disrupted.”\nProf Dunbar was speaking at the AAAS annual meeting in Boston.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:06:45.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
