A post shared by SURFER (@surfer_magazine) on Feb 22, 2017 at 11:55am PST \nThe post from SURFER credits the efforts of Portuguese surfers Tiago Pires and Nic Von Rupp, as well as the U.S. Embassy in helping free Reynolds. SURFER Editor Todd Prodanovich told GrindTV that Reynolds had been successfully given a temporary U.S. Passport and is now free to go about his trip in Portugal. \nA story in Portugal’s Tribuna Express reported earlier that Reynolds had been detained upon arriving at the Lisbon International Airport from England, having lost his passport on the plane and unable to present it to immigration officials. \nTribuna Express obtained a response from Portugal’s Foreigners and Borders Service clarifying the situation that stated: \n“Following the request, the Foreigners and Borders Service (SEF) confirms that on February 20, at 20:00 [8:00 p.m.], a foreign citizen without a passport arrived at Lisbon Airport from England, who presented himself as the surfer Dane Reynolds, said he lost his passport on the plane but was not found. In the absence of a travel document, in accordance with the legislation in force, it was in the custody of the SEF and all the conditions for that purpose were guaranteed. The SEF, in accordance with the procedures in force, contacted the US Embassy for the purpose of identifying the citizen in question. A representative of the Embassy attended this morning at Lisbon Airport so the situation is in the process of being resolved.” \nTribuna Express also noted that the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon does not issue passports outside of the Embassy, and Reynolds would have thus been banned from Portuguese soil if Embassy representatives had not shown up to the airport with the emergency document, having to send him back to the country of origin to deal with the situation at the U.S. Embassy there. Thankfully they showed up with the temporary passport.

No mention was made of the treatment which Reynolds received while detained.
