Clearly being of the two-wheel enthusiast type, this wasn't just your regular fuel-efficiency crazy, seat-a-family-of-four scoot. Aprilia gave us the SR 150. A proper power-scooter in every sense of the word. \nIt was fast, an exception handler, most definitely an edgy looker and scoffed at the first thought fuel frugality. Every boy racer in the business was left grinning from ear-to-ear. Wanting to bring even more excitement into the mix, Aprilia has given us the SR 150 Race. Aprilia SR 150 Race Edition.

That comes in the form of a Maze Grey body coating with red, black and green tri-colour livery inspired by Aprilia's very own MotoGP race bikes, the RS-GP. Contributing to the sassiness are alloys and rear suspension spring finished in Fluo Rosso red. Topping off the design details is the front disc-brake calliper which is now coloured in gold.

From sharp lines and contours which the SR 150 brought to the table, the Race version furthers that by really accentuating those design creases. Aprilia SR 150 Race Edition.

Ergonomics are definitely on the aggressive side but you'd soon forgive that when you realise how well it also holds you in your seat when flinging the scooter into a corner. \nHandling: \nAs for the handling department, only a handful of bikes can hold a candle to the standard SR 150 and the Race, I'm glad to say, still retains that crown. Combine the structural rigidity of the steel frame chassis, tautness of the suspension and grip from the Vee Rubber... err, rubbers, what you have with you is a recipe for absolute glee. Only now the passer-by's eyes will open wider, tongues roll-out further and spine tingles last a wee bit longer. Aprilia SR 150 Race Edition.

Aprilia has fettled with the CVT gearbox, improved gear ratios in order to favour faster acceleration as compared to outright speed. \nThe rider though will definitely be hard-pressed to notice these changes when simply pottering around town. However, under heavy acceleration and riding the standard and Race version of the SR 150 back-to-back, you'll notice that the latter is more springy off its feet. Aprilia SR 150 Race Edition. (Photo: Simran Rastogi) \nSuspension: \nIn the bigger scheme of things, the SR 150 Race is still very much the sprightly little machine we loved. The amount of hooliganism it allows is unrivalled and my unhappy photographer will a be a testament to that fact. If things do get a little out of control, the 220mm disk brakes and 140mm rear drum-brakes do a good job of bringing the scooter to a halt, helping push your confidence even further. \nEngine: \nThe 155cc single-cylinder engine still produces a respectable 10.4bhp and 11.4Nm of torque. As soon as starter is thumbed, the engine fires up with a throaty burble, immediately wanting to start a fight with the next helpless soul it sees. This type of immediacy is not a trait for those who preach serenity. Instead, it aims straight at those who nurture the spirit of a boy racer within. Aprilia SR 150 Race Edition.

Yes it does lose out on the practicality bits like a tiny underseat storage, an undersized footboard and it will never be called the kmpl king amongst scooters, does that really affect my buying decision though?

Costing just Rs 3,000 over the price of the standard SR 150, the Race variants makes a whole lot of sense in my books.
