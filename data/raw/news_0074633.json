He drugged Bailey with his own sleeping medication before hiding her body, along with that of her pet dachshund, Boris, in a 100-year-old cesspit concealed beneath the garage of their £1.3m property in Royston, Hertfordshire. Ian Stewart. Photograph: Hertfordshire constabulary/PA \nPolice are now re-examining the death of Stewart’s first wife, Diane, who died suddenly in 2010. An inquest ruled she had died of natural causes. Police said there was currently no evidence to suggest her death was suspicious. \nDuring the six-week trial St Albans crown court heard that Stewart, 56, deceived police by telling them three days after Bailey went missing that she had gone to Broadstairs in Kent. He told police she had left a note that she “needed some time” and a missing persons investigation was launched. \nBut on 11 April 2016, Stewart had killed Bailey, 51, probably by suffocation, before dumping her body in the cesspit. \nOn the same day he changed a standing order from Bailey’s bank account to the couple’s joint account, switching the amount from £600 to £4,000. The former software engineer, who had not worked since the mid-90s due to ill health, tried to delete the history of the transaction but a small fragment of information that read “11/4/2016” and “£4,000” was found on his laptop. \nBailey, who wrote fiction for young adults including the popular Electra Brown books, had changed her will in 2014 to make Stewart the main beneficiary. She also took out a life insurance policy to cover a potential £1.2m inheritance tax bill should she die before they were married. \nOn the day of the murder he was captured on CCTV dumping a large white object – possibly a duvet used in the killing – at a tip, before trying to push through the sale of one of Bailey’s houses in Gateshead with her solicitor. That afternoon he went to watch his son play bowls before buying a Chinese takeaway for them both at home. That night, knowing Bailey was already dead, he sent a text message to her phone reading “xx”, the court heard. \nStewart kept up a charade in the weeks and months after killing his partner. He paid for flyers to raise awareness about her disappearance but secretly renewed Arsenal season tickets using her account and then flew to Spain for a holiday the couple had planned to take together. \nHe was arrested, three months after Bailey went missing, on 11 July. His first response was “you’re joking”, followed by “bloody hell why?” and then: “Have you found Helen?” \nStewart had hidden the fact that the house had a second cesspit under the garage, parking Bailey’s car over its opening. But after a further search on 15 July police discovered Bailey’s body there. \nDuring police questioning Stewart maintained a near total silence, but later concocted a defence labelled “bizarre” by police. He claimed after Bailey had gone missing two men, known only as Nick and Joe, came to the house and assaulted and threatened him. He claimed the men were business associates of Bailey’s first husband and had kidnapped the author but the story was dismissed as a lie. \nStewart was also found guilty of fraud for altering a standing order; of preventing a lawful burial by hiding Bailey’s body; and of three counts of perverting the course of justice, including disposing of evidence, carrying out a “charade” in the days after her death and disposing of her mobile phone. \nBailey was grieving for her first husband, John Sinfield – who drowned in 2011 when the couple were on holiday in Barbados – when she met Stewart. Stuart Trimmer QC, prosecuting, told the jury Bailey was “grossly deceived by someone who was preying on her”. In a memoir about her loss, When Bad Things Happen in Good Bikinis, she described meeting Stewart, calling him her “gorgeous grey-haired widower”. On its final page she wrote: “BB, I love you. You are my happy ever after.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:27:21.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
