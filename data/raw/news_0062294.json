By Aakar Rastogi , ECONOMICTIMES.COM | Updated: Feb 23, 2017, 02.00 PM IST Is Modi on a road to nowhere in Uttar Pradesh? You have a large amount to invest for a long period. Typically, everybody would ask you to start a SIP or STP (Systematic Investment Plan or a Systematic Transfer Plan) in an equity mutual fund. But there is a big question: should you do an SIP or STP for six months? Or one year? Or even longer. The question is important as there is no unanimity among mutual fund advisors about the period. There is also no formula to find out the ideal time-frame to transfer your money to equity mutual fund schemes. \"You should ideally spread your investment over 12 months, especially when the markets are expensive,\" says Purav Mehta, Certified Financial Planner, Wealth First Advisors. According to him, spreading the investment amount over a year gives you sufficient time and opportunities. SIP and STP have become the preferred method to stagger investments over a long period. While SIP is preferred by salary earners, STP is recommended to investors with a large amount to invest. The investor route the investment through a bank account in an SIP, whereas the money is parked in a debt mutual fund (preferably liquid or ultra short-term funds; some also use arbitrage funds) and transferred to an equity mutual fund scheme via STP. Both methods help investors to benefit from cost averaging and maximise returns. \"There is no scientific formula to decide the duration,\" says Jimmy Patel, CEO, Quantum Mutual Fund. \"For how long you should stagger your investments depends on the individual; his risk appetite and the objective for which he is investing,\" adds Patel. According to him, individual investors should not try to time the market as it could prove extremely risky. Finally, how do you decide the duration of SIP or STP? We believe investors can adopt a common-sense approach. For example, an investor with a modest corpus can invest in six months or a year. But an investor with a large or very large corpus can stagger it over a year or two or even longer period. The person can also make extra investments whenever there is a big fall in the market.
