It's easy to be angry on adrenaline, but it's much, much harder when you are just tired, and this is going to be exhausting.\" \nJohn Oliver is not excited as one might think to return to late-night TV. \nThe Last Week Tonight host stopped by The Late Show on Tuesday for a talk between late-night hosts about coping with day-to-day updates from the Trump administration, as well as a special edition of \"Community Calendar\" to learn all about Oliver's hometown. \nThe late-night hosts, formerly Daily Show colleagues, spoke about Oliver's hiatus, with Last Week Tonight returning to HBO on Sunday for the first time since November. \n“Until inauguration day, nothing was really happening. It was just being tied to a train track, watching the train coming,\" said Oliver, adding that he hasn't wished he was on air covering Trump thus far. \"And then of course, inauguration day is the train hitting you, and you say, 'yup, that felt pretty much how I thought it was going to feel.'\" \n\"It's exhausting,\" Oliver said of witnessing the Trump administration's decisions so far. \"It feels like inauguration day was 114 years ago. We have a long way to go, it's going to be hard. It's easy to be angry on adrenaline, but it's much, much harder when you are just tired, and this is going to be exhausting.\" \nThe duo also touched on President Trump's travel ban and what may happen if Oliver is sent back home. \"You're here on a green card, we hope you can stay here,\" said Colbert, assuring him that \"we all like you here.\" \n\"I am slightly concerned,\" said Oliver. \"I have an American wife and an American son now, but who knows what's enough? Having a green card used to be enough.\" \nBut just in case he has to go back, they decided to take another look at what's happening in his hometown. Oliver described his hometown of Bedford as \"a scrappy town. You back it into a corner, it'll chew your face off.\" \n\"Welcome to 'Community Calendar,'\" Colbert introduced the show-within-a-show, \"your source for what's happening in and around Bedford, the county town of Bedfordshire, and the greater region of... I'm gonna say Bedfordington.\" \nThe two hosts presented a series of real events happening in Bedford, including \"Badgers in a Box,\" spooky stories and \"Circus of Horrors.\"\"It'll leave you with terrifying questions like, 'Why do people in Bedford keep doing Halloween stuff in February?'\" \nOr, according to Oliver, go to \"The Great War Through the Magic Lantern,\"\"because in England it seems everything must sound like a f—ing Harry Potter title.\" \nWatch the segment below.
