After lagging in third or fourth place among the four largest domestic carriers, the world's largest airline moved into second place in on-time arrival performance behind — you guessed it — perennial top gun Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL). American, which has its third-largest hub at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, ended January with 76.4 percent of its flights arriving on time, behind first-place Delta's 77.5 percent on-time arrival result. The United States Department of Transportation considers a flight to have arrived on time if it reaches the gate within 14 minutes of its scheduled arrival time. Enlarge American Airlines showed some marked improvement in on-time arrival performance in the… more Despite the new spirit that United's upbeat CEO Oscar Munoz has been promoting at the Chicago-based airline, United sank to fourth and last place in January in on-time arrivals among the four largest U.S. airlines. United ended the month with 73.3 percent of flights arriving on time. Though United is slowly but surely moving more traffic to its more dependable mainline operations, the carrier's on-time performance still is being negatively affected by several regional carrier operators that have struggled to consistently get regional United Express flights to the gate on time. United also has a major hub at Newark Liberty International Airport, which is among the most delay-prone airports in the nation due to the density of traffic in the metro New York City air space. United is a unit of United Continental Holdings (NYSE: UAL). Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) did okay for the month of January, finishing third among the big four, with 75.5 per cent of its flights arriving on time. Southwest's on-time issues often stem from its inability to turn aircraft in the allotted 35 minutes when they arrive late with a full complement of passengers needing to deplane and another full plane of people waiting to get on board. January also was not a good month for United in the flight cancellations department. United had the highest percentage of cancellations for the month at 2.9 percent, followed by American at 2.7 percent. Delta canceled only 1.8 percent of its flights and Southwest 1.2 percent.
