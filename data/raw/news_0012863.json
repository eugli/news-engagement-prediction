View photo Queens Jogger Murder Suspect Allegedly Said He 'Lost It' and Choked Victim, in Videotaped Confessions (ABC News) \nChanel Lewis, 20, the Brooklyn man accused of murdering Queens jogger Karina Vetrano, allegedly gave two videotaped confessions in which he said he \"lost it\" and choked her to death, according to an official briefed on the investigation. \nLewis was arrested this weekend in New York a little over six months after 30-year-old Vetrano's death. She was fatally strangled on Aug. 2, 2016, while jogging alone in Howard Beach in the borough of Queens, on a path where she and her father often ran together. \nPolice do not believe Lewis knew Vetrano. \nAccording to the official, in Lewis' alleged confessions, he indicated that on the day of the murder, he was angry about something at home and left his family apartment. He said that he wandered into Spring Creek Park in Queens and that when he saw Vetrano, he just \"lost it\" and hit and choked her, according to the official. Lewis gave a detailed account of the attack but denied any sexual assault, according to the official. ABC News has not been able to determine whether Lewis had a lawyer present at the time he was recorded. \nLewis was first approached by police about the murder last week; he gave a voluntary DNA sample, which matched DNA recovered from the crime scene, police said. He was taken into custody on Saturday and charged with second-degree murder, police said. \nPolice have recovered evidence from Lewis' home, including clothing he may have been wearing at the time of the attack, the official said. \nLewis made his first appearance in court Sunday and did not enter a plea. The case is being presented to a grand jury to consider sexual assault charges.
