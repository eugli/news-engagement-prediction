The reservoir captures water from the Tuolumne River, a key tributary of the San Joaquin.\nMeanwhile, water was receding in the farm community of Maxwell, about 112 kilometres north of Sacramento, where dozens of people sought higher ground Friday after creeks topped their banks and inundated houses. Crews used boats to rescue residents from the low-lying neighbourhood.\nOfficials advised residents to be ready to evacuate.\n“We're telling those people to keep a bag close by and get ready to leave again,” said Colusa County Assistant Sheriff Jim Saso Saso. “If the water comes back up, it's going to be those areas affected.”\nAbout 100 kilometres east, the water level continued to fall at Oroville Dam, where a damaged spillway had raised major flood concerns and prompted the evacuation of 188,000 people last weekend.\nThe amount of water flowing down the spillway was increased from 55,000 cubic feet a second to 60,000 cubic feet a second Sunday afternoon in anticipation of the storm, the California Department of Water Resources said. Last week, outflows were at nearly 100,000 cubic feet a second.\nDuring recent storms, authorities up and down the state have dealt with overflowing creeks, mudslide threats in foothill areas blackened by fires, road collapses and hundreds of toppled trees in neighbourhoods. At least three people have died.\nRelated Stories Flood fears renewed as another storm aims for California Southern California rain eases; north facing renewed storm Photos Major flooding is seen in Maxwell, Colusa County, Calif. on Saturday, Feb. 18, 2017.
