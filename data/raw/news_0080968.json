What grade A trolling. \nAlso, can we not have KKK marches ever? Thanks. \nHero tuba player trolls entire KKK march with doofy music #AntiFa Posted by Great Lakes AntiFa on Sunday, February 26, 2017 Tweets by @AlexontheMic What's up? I'm Alex! So I guess I'll tell you a little bit about myself. I grew up in South Jersey (10 minutes from Philly) and went to school a few minutes from Lexington, Kentucky. Growing up I always wanted to be on the air. What's better than talking about and listening to music for a living? Sounds like a pretty good job to me. I'm here to to provide some good music for your ears and keep you informed on all the latest things happening around here. Sound good?
