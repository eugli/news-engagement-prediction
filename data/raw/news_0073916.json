I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 \nTrump has long had an adversarial relationship with news media. In recent weeks, he has accused some news outlets of publishing \"fake news.\" \nTrump has also slammed reporters for using anonymous sources. His frustration includes reports describing contacts between his campaign advisers and Russian intelligence agents, which the White House has disputed. Yet members of his staff regularly demand anonymity when talking to reporters \nIn a statement following Trump's tweet, WHCA President Jeff Mason says the organization \"looks forward to having its annual dinner on April 29.\" Noting Trump's Twitter announcement, Mason calls the dinner \"a celebration of the First Amendment and the important role played by an independent news media in a healthy republic.\" \nCopyright 2017 by The Associated Press.
