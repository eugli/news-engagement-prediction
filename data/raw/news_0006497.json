Rec Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is the latest NFL player to chime in on President Donald Trump, doing so in a Facebook Live video while at the barbershop . “Despite anybody’s political issues or views, everybody has a right to choose who they want to vote for,” Wilson said. “But this thing’s getting out of hand. It’s getting out of hand, people. ... When you think about, it’s only been what, two weeks? Or even less? We’ve got to attack this issue here.” Wilson also disclosed that he voted for Hillary Clinton. In referencing Trump’s executive order that suspended entry of all refugees from seven Muslim-majority nations, he said, \"We go to the LAX airport, and there’s people all over the place fighting for their lives and protesting. \"All the protests that have gone on through the African-American community, through obviously the Muslim community too, if we’re going to be a nation that says we’re equal, we have to be equal -- obviously being smart, all that kind of stuff.” Wilson continued, \"Now you kind of recognize that people’s feelings are getting hurt, people’s lives getting changed, people are getting sent back or not let in back home to see their families for reasons that may not be worthy. Just because you believe in something or you’re from a certain place doesn’t mean that you’re a bad person.\" Wilson touched on his own faith, saying that everyone has to find ways to love people and care for each other. He also questioned whether or not Trump would last his entire term. “I don’t know if [Trump's] even going to be able to last four years, in my opinion. You don’t want to wish bad upon anybody, because if he doesn’t last four years, that means that something went wrong. So hopefully nothing goes wrong any more than what it’s already doing.” You can watch the video below. Wilson starts to talk about Trump at the 9:30 mark in the video. \nBarbershop Talk Season 2.
