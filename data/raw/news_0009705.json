The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.\nThere are also more than 95 outposts - settlements built without official authorisation from the Israeli government - across the West Bank.\nCan Jewish settlement issue be resolved? Blame and bitterness keep peace at bay In the statement on Thursday, the White House said: \"While we don't believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal.\"\nIt said Mr Trump's administration looked forward to discuss the issue during Mr Netanyahu's visit to Washington later this month.\nIn December, Mr Trump, who was at the time president-elect, said a vote at the UN Security Council was a \"big loss\" for Israel which \"will make it much harder to negotiate peace\", vowing \"we will get it done anyway\".\nHe also promised that \"things will be different\" at the UN after he took office.\nThe UN resolution - the first since 1979 to condemn Israel over its settlement policy - said the settlements had \"no legal validity\" and constituted \"a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution\".\nMr Netanyahu and former US President Barack Obama had a difficult relationship during Mr Obama's two terms and Israel had feared that Washington would support such a UN move in the final weeks of his presidency.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3A73/production/_93836941_west_bank_settlement_624-4.png", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7925/production/_93931013_3fcc591f-40f2-4696-af10-c1d3e237f6c9.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-38458884", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-38842551", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-36682062"], "published": "2017-02-03T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:27:55.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
