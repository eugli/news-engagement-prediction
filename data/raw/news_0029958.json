Conservative party leadership candidate Maxime Bernier is questioning a Liberal proposal to condemn Islamaphobia. ( Paul Chiasson / THE CANADIAN PRESS ) By Alex Boutilier Ottawa Bureau Reporter Tues., Feb. 14, 2017 OTTAWA—A push to condemn Islamophobia in the House of Commons has created a wedge in the Conservative leadership race, driven by far-right blogs claiming it’s an attack on freedom of expression. The motion, scheduled to be debated in Parliament on Wednesday, asks MPs to recognize the need to “quell the increasing public climate of hate and fear” against Muslims and condemn “all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination.” It further asks the Common’s heritage committee to examine the issues of racism and religious discrimination, including Islamophobia , and to collect more data on hate crimes in Canada. The motion, introduced by Liberal Mississauga–Erin Mills MP Iqra Khalid, would in no way change Canadian hate crime laws, nor does it call for further limiting Canadians’ Charter-guaranteed right to freedom of expression. But over the weekend, prominent Conservative MPs vying for the party’s leadership say they’ve been convinced to vote against the bill. Article Continued Below “Is this motion a first step towards restricting our right to criticize Islam?” wrote Maxime Bernier , one of the race’s leading candidates, over the weekend. “Given the international situation, and the fact that jihadi terrorism is today the most important threat to our security, I think this is a serious concern we have to take into account.” Bernier connected the motion to “blasphemy” and “Sharia” law, concerns that have no connection to the text of the motion, but mirror opposition on far-right blogs and from anonymous social media users. Amira Elghawaby, a spokesperson for the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said it’s “unclear” how studying Islamophobia and other forms of religious discrimination would limit freedom of speech. “It’s undeniable, when you’ve just had six people gunned down in a place of worship, it’s undeniable that there is Islamophobia in Canada,” Elghawaby told the Star on Tuesday. “Even prior to that attack in Quebec City, we have been documenting rising hate crimes targeting Muslims in this country … To study these issues, again, is not at all to limit anybody’s freedom.” “I think it’s a red herring.” Khalid’s motion was introduced in December, more than a month before 27-year old Alexandre Bissonette allegedly stormed a Quebec City mosque and murdered six Muslim men at their evening prayers. Michael Chong, another candidate for Conservative leadership, said that in light of that attack, it’s proper for parliamentarians to study anti-Muslim prejudice and discrimination. Against the argument that the motion would grant “special privileges” to Canadian Muslims, Chong noted that the House of Commons has only last year condemned political campaigns against Israel and the genocide of Yazidis in Iraq and Syria. “In denouncing Islamophobia, the motion is simply denouncing discrimination and prejudice against Muslims and people of the Islamic faith,” Chong wrote in a statement. “Nothing more or less. Motion 103 will not prevent anyone from criticizing Islam or radical Islamic terrorists.” Chong added that he would repeal section 319 of the Criminal Code, which governs hate speech, saying he believes the best way to combat hate speech is through more free speech. Richard Moon, a University of Windsor law professor specializing in freedom of expression and freedom of religion issues, said that he can’t see how Khalid’s motion would limit Canadians’ right to criticize Islam. Moon said it’s becoming easier to recognize the connection between hateful speech against a group and violence directed at that group. “One of the mistakes about how we think about hate speech law is very often we think about the spread of hatred leading to widespread, socially established, politically and legally-enforced oppression and violence,” Moon said in an interview. “Whereas maybe what we should be thinking about, as often, are appeals to fringe groups. Speech that happens online on sites where people go (and get) reinforced and more emboldened to take action.” Howard Anglin, a former deputy chief of staff to Stephen Harper, told the Star Monday he believes concerns of the impact this motion will have on freedom of speech may be “conflated” with other issues at the provincial or even corporate level. Anglin pointed to the case of Jordan Peterson , a University of Toronto professor who is refusing to use non-binary pronouns (i.e. respecting a student’s wish not to be called “he” or “she”). “I’m somewhat sympathetic … It is confusing, if you’re not a lawyer and you haven’t spent time actually studying the issue closely,” Anglin said. “I think there is a lot of general concern about political correctness, for want of a better term. Political correctness, limiting what is considered to be acceptable speech or acceptable views just generally. So any law, bill, motion, human rights act, whatever, that seems to be in line with that, even if it doesn’t have teeth that will actually enforce that law, I think is seen as part of the overall threat.” “I’m sympathetic probably to people who see it all as part of a multi-dimensional attempt to restrict what are ‘acceptable’ and ‘mainstream’ views and speech. So I think to that extent, there’s a legitimate free speech issue that sort of emanates from these, but it individually none of these (efforts) may pose the grave threat that their critics are concerned about.” The Star requested an interview with Khalid, Bernier, and Scheer on Tuesday. Khalid’s office did not return multiple interview requests. Representatives for the Bernier and Scheer campaigns said their statements from the weekend stand.
