The network has since attracted a thousand more members taking the total to over 2200. \nLewis said, \"One of the reasons why I was motivated to start the WE network was because I was seeing a lot of my peers try and start businesses whilst they've got young children and for me I started my business when I was so young, I made all the mistakes in my 20s and I had time to grow the business without the stress of a family.\" \nLewis co-founded a nanny agency called KiwiOz in London when she was 22 that supported New Zealand and Australian nannies moving to the UK. Now 37 years old, Lewis still directs the business from afar with 10 employees in London, and branches in Auckland, Wellington and Sydney and is a full-time mum of daughter Amelia, 3. \nREAD MORE: * Shocking lack of women in New Zealand's Business Hall of Fame \nShe said the WE network is comprised of a broad demographic of established and experienced business owners and women just starting out, but the majority are women in their 30s to 40s. \n\"I think a lot of women are making the decisions to make businesses because they've chosen to turn their back on a corporate lifestyle and they're kind of thinking, 'Why am I even bothering with the glass ceiling when I can just walk around the building and start my own business?'\" \nThe shortage of women in leadership in the corporate world was glaringly apparent. In the December 2016 quarter 13 per cent of company directors in the NZX and 27 per cent of company officers were female. Chief executive of Chorus Kate McKenzie has become the only female chief executive of a NZX 50 company after her appointment to the position this week. \nLewis said the choice for women to start a business happened a lot of the time because the corporate lifestyle was not meeting their needs. \n\"We're doing it in a way that compliments life as a woman and allows them the time that they need to build their skills before they start investing a lot of money.\" Ad Feedback \nLearning not to invest too much money in marketing right off the bat, making a solid business plans, and productivity hacks are aspects of the monthly boot camp sessions the WE network offers. Lewis said the classes give women who did not have a small business background a basic understanding of skills they would not have learned in a corporate environment. \n\"It's actually recognised that women have a lack of funding, time, resources, and support,\" said Lewis. \nShe said without peer support and encouragement those struggles can lead to a lack of confidence. \n\"One of the real goals is getting women to move from the thinking their business might be able to generate $30,000 to $40,000 dollars a year to thinking this could be a serious operation with hundreds of thousands of dollars in turnover and impact on the economy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T07:05:59.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
