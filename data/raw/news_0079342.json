Aiesha Bailey A price of $539,000 for 480 square feet is not a bargain by any reasonable measure. But finding a single family home at that price in Los Feliz is increasingly rare, even if the pad is tiny. And that’s what we have here at 1747 North New Hampshire Avenue. At least the darling bungalow, built in 1921, requires no fixing up. It’s lathered in white paint and decked out in subway tiles, glossy countertops, and on-trend light fixtures. It holds one bedroom and one bathroom in an open floor plan that also fits a kitchen, small living room, and dining area with pitched ceilings. There’s no back yard, but there is fenced-in font yard with gravel and concrete pavers and enough room for a sitting area. What it lacks in space, it makes up for in location. It’s walking distance to shops, restaurants, and bars on Hillhurst and Vermont avenues, as well as to Griffith Park and Barnsdall Park.
