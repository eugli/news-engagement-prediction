It provides a lot of support. These people coming round, it's only little but it helps a lot.\" Image caption The part-time bookeeper prepares about 12 hot meals each week \nMrs Dixon sees herself as lucky enough to be able to afford to do something to help. \n\"I'm in a fortunate position in that I can pay for it myself,\" she said. \n\"I get looked after myself by my partner, he provides for me and I spend my wage on the homeless. \n\"There are regular faces that we see, we see some new people now and again but most are regulars. \n\"All of them say there is not enough help out for them. It's drink and drugs, marriage break-ups, anything can cause it.\" \nShe said she usually cooks things like meatballs with pasta, pulled pork sandwiches and apple pie and custard and takes it round with a friend, Kai Kye, 30. \nHer partner, Richard Willis, 53, and their daughter Charlotte Dixon, 22, also help out on the rounds. One of the simplest ways is to alert a professional, to help rough sleepers access help and support Give food and time, not money Offer a gift like a hat, gloves, or clean dry socks For homeless people with dogs, offer them dog food \nThe story comes as the homelessness charity Crisis warns homelessness is rising at an \"appalling rate\" . \nFigures from the Department for Communities and Local Government show more than half of councils in England recorded a rise in rough sleeping in 2016 compared with the year before. \nMatt Downie, director of policy and external affairs at Crisis, said: \"Cold weather conditions can prove fatal for people sleeping on the streets. Tragically, the average age of death for a homeless person is just 47. \n\"As temperatures drop, local authorities should be doing all they can to protect rough sleepers. This action could be a lifesaver for those with nowhere left to turn.\" Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:05:00.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
