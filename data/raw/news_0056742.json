Now, Verizon is testing the tech that will eventually be rolled out when 5G is available everywhere -- which isn't expected until 2020. \nAT&T ( T , Tech30 ) also plans to test 5G outside the lab. The company will begin testing 5G with DirecTV Now customers in Austin soon. \nFaster broadband means you'll be able to download and consume more high-quality video. It also means you'll pay more for data.
