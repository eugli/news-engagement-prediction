(Photo: Ed Mulholland, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW YORK -- Anderson Silva buried his bald head in his left hand for about 10 seconds. \nHe needed time to collect himself before fielding the question from Joe Rogan. Just how does it feel to finally taste victory again -- the all-time great's first win since October 2012? \nSilva just might still have some fight left in him. \n\"The Spider\" entered UFC 208 on Saturday with a record of 0-4 (one no contest) in his last five fights. His last victory prior to this? A first-round TKO to extend his record for most consecutive title defenses. Finally, though, Silva is back to winning ways after a controversial unanimous decision win over Derek Brunson. \nAll three judges scored it for Silva: 30-27, 29-28 and 29-28. USA TODAY Sports gave the nod to Brunson, 29-28. \nMore: Twitter reacts to Anderson Silva's controversial victory over Derek Brunson at UFC 208 \nSilva, the UFC's No. 7 middleweight, was on his back for the final minute-plus of the three-round bout as Brunson, in full mount, whacked him with rights and lefts. \nSilva (34-8, 1 NC) also ate a slew of uppercuts in the clinch while he clasped his hands around Brunson's neck in an attempt to land the knee's that made him such a feared fighter. \nBut judges preferred Silva's activity level. He was the aggressor, while Brunson (who has now lost two in a row) fought from a surprisingly tentative stance for most of the encounter. \nThe 41-year-old drilled Brunson with a roundhouse kick in Round 1, before Brunson, 33, connected with a series of uppercuts. Silva ended the frame with a flying knee that missed, sending him to the mat. \nBrunson (16-5) clearly lost Round 2 after being dropped by a thunderous kick to the chest, which sent the North Carolina native into a shell for much of the round. He continued to test Silva with feints, but never followed up with combinations. Rather, it was Silva that was busy. The Brazilian continued to press forward with kicks and knees. \nSilva clearly is a shell of his former self, but with a return to the win column, he surely will be in line for another big payday.
