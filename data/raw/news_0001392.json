(AP Photo/Tony Dejak) By Evan Grant , Staff Writer Contact Evan Grant on Twitter: @Evan_P_Grant \nWho doesn't love a nice, sappy Valentine's Day love story? \nWell, I got one for you: \nOn that day, Feb. 14 th , slugger Mike Napoli and the Texas Rangers come figuratively running across a meadow into each other's arms and commit to one another for a third time. Just replace the long heather of a meadow with the shorn grass of a baseball field. \nYes, it's sappy. Yes, it's romantic. And, yes, it makes all the sense in the world. \nMind you, this is just theory. For now. \nBut here's why I'm circling Feb. 14 as the day Napoli, the perpetual Bachelor, accepts millions of roses from the Rangers and comes back to play some first base, some DH and be part of the glue that holds the team together: \nFor insurance purposes, the Rangers must carry Prince Fielder on their 40-man roster during the offseason. In addition, Jake Diekman is out for at least the first half of the season while recovering from colon surgery. In effect, the Rangers have had 38 usable spots on the 40-man roster during the important roster construction phase of the winter. Pitchers, a position where the Rangers are trying to build up depth, take up 23 of the spots. \nFeb. 14, the day pitchers and catchers start reporting to spring training, is the first day the Rangers can move Fielder and Diekman to the 60-day DL. Players on the 60-day DL do not count against the 40-man roster. Rangers expect big strides from Martin Perez in 2017: 'God gave him an arm that is just unreal' \nIf they can buy themselves a couple of weeks until the 14 th , they regain roster flexibility and they don't risk exposing any of the pitching depth they've acquired this offseason to the waiver wire. \nAll that's needed here is a handshake. \nAnd that's where we enter the mystery portion of the love story. In a world of legally binding contracts, handshake agreements aren't the norm. In fact, they'd be quite frowned upon by MLB and the Players' Association. Perhaps that is why nobody on either side of this theory is commenting. \nIt all makes sense, though. \nDespite a 34-home run season last year, Napoli hasn't been really heavily engaged with any potential suitors for a while now. He was seeking a two- or three-year deal early in the free agency period. It was initially assumed he'd end up back in Cleveland, but the Indians jumped on Edwin Encarnacion when his price for a long-term deal started dropping. Napoli's options have been drying up ever since. \nThe Rangers have maintained contact and expressed interest all along, but on nothing more than a one-year deal. The Rangers also had bigger priorities to tend to during the offseason and had to figure those out, then figure out how much money they had left to work with after. By signing Carlos Gomez, Andrew Cashner and Tyson Ross all to inexpensive one-year deals, they met those needs. What they've got left to spend probably is somewhere between $7-10 million, at the max. \nThe Rangers have a plethora of left-handed hitting options at first base in comeback candidate Josh Hamilton, veteran James Loney, eternal prospect Joey Gallo and the versatile Jurickson Profar. All of them would best be used in a platoon-type situation for various reasons. Hamilton to protect his brittle body and the others because of lopsided batting splits. Profar (from the left) and Ryan Rua (from the right) also provide an inexpensive platoon option. The ideal fit for that would be in left field, but it demands the Rangers have a right-handed hitting first base option. \nNapoli, 35, is still quite effective against left-handed pitching. He hit .262 with a .366 OBP and .817 OPS vs. lefties last year. Over the last three years, he's got an .894 OPS vs. left-handers and .725 vs. right-handers. He still fields first base well. As he moves into his mid-30s, perhaps a little less playing time (coming in the form of a loose platoon) may keep him more fresh. Napoli or Hamilton could also slide into the DH role if Shin-Shoo Choo plays some outfield or if Choo gets hurt again. \nIt's been a long offseason flirtation. All it's missing is the happy romantic ending. \nValentine's Day seems an appropriate way to end it. -- Listen live to Sportsradio The Ticket 1310am/96.7fm and rewind and pause up to 1 hour -- Free access to breaking news, analysis, podcasts and more New Android version soon!
