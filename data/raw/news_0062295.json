Her latest hair transformation, though, might be the sleekest yet. \nIt seems the supermodel swapped her long, dark brown style for a pin-straight, jet black lob—a look that can be attributed to London-based hair maestro George Northwood, who uploaded a photo of Hadid to Instagram on Thursday. \"Great to have Bella in the salon over LFW for a touch of darker colour by Kat ❤︎ and a new Lob by me! ✂,\" he captioned the pic, likely confirming Hadid's lob is indeed a legit cut and not just a wig. \nCheck out Hadid's new look for yourself: Loading View on Instagram \nThe 20-year-old is one of many female celebrities to go shorter this year. Everyone from Olivia Wilde to Selena Gomez has experimented with bobs in 2017, while Lea Michele recently chopped off a half a foot of her hair . It's a trend that Hollywood hairstylist Chris Appleton predicted back in January when he gave Pretty Little Liars star Shay Mitchell a textured \"power bob.\" \nBut back to Bella: She's rocking the hell out of this look, and hopefully she keeps it long enough for us to properly appreciate it before moving on to her next hairstyle. \nRelated stories: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:09:23.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
