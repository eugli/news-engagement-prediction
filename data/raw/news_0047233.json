Taking time to understand all concepts and maintaining a regular study schedule will help you. Ask your teachers and family to help too.(Getty Images/iStockphoto) \nThere are many students who perform well in junior school but cannot cope with the pressure of studies when they go to higher classes. After that it’s a downhill ride for them. \nMy advice to them is, that if they have been doing well till senior school, then they have definitely mastered the basics required to achieve good scores. Performance of many students generally dips in Class 11 and this is due to various reasons. One of them is that students have to concentrate on specialised academic work and work only on certain subjects that they have chosen. Secondly, with the Class 10 Boards not made compulsory till 2018 and with a year to go for Class 12 Boards, most students tend to take life a little easy during the interim period. \nIf poor performance in studies puts you through enormous mental stress. It may be a good idea to have a detailed discussion regarding what is causing this stress with the people you trust such as your teachers or parents.

Here’s help \nEven if you are able to study only for short intervals right now, do not lose hope. Whenever you have the time go back to your studies. Make charts, notes, keep memorising the difficult parts. Do not forget to maintain a routine of healthy eating, regular sleep and physical exercise. \nThere is no hard and fast rule about the perfect time to study. See what timings work best for you and when your concentration levels are high. Tackle new material when you are fresh. Do your revision later. \nThe author is a senior psychiatrist and incharge, Institute of Life Skills & Mental Health Promotion, Moolchand Medcity, New Delhi. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T19:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:12:46.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
