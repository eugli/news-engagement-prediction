I’m more confident of the higher amounts in the south metro than the north metro.”\nMore certainty for a wintry wallop is southeastern Minnesota, Ahasic said.\n“Rochester is the bull’s-eye for this one,” he said.\nIn the meantime, the Twin Cities will continue to bask in temperatures topping or hovering around record highs. A high of 61 degrees is forecast for Tuesday afternoon. That would topple the all-time high on a Feb. 21 of 59 set in 1930. The forecast high of 58 Wednesday would nudge off the record books the Feb. 22, 1930, reading of 57.\nThen the cool-down rolls in, opening the door for the snow to pile up, with highs forecast by the NWS to be barely above 30 for Thursday, Friday and stretching into the weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:17:07.291+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
