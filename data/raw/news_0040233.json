Simon Hetherington, commander of the 3rd Canadian Division, under which 1 PPCLI falls.\n\"I understand that the mandate is being reviewed by our government and we're prepared to react in any eventuality, whether that means changing our posture in theatre to embrace new tasks or to reduce the number, if that's what the government asks us to do.\"\n'This is not building an army' The Edmonton-based soldiers will relieve their counterparts from 2 PPCLI, based out of Shilo, Man., who have been on the ground training Ukrainian forces near the city of Lviv since August.\nThe battalion will also be providing the majority of troops for the start of Canada's mission in Latvia, which is expected to ramp up in the coming months before becoming fully operational in the summer.\nOngoing war in Ukraine turns 1.7 million people into refugees Canada has committed to send about 450 troops to lead a multinational NATO force in the Baltic state, which is intended to deter any potential Russian aggression in the region.\nHetherington described the Latvia mission as \"a bit of back to the future\" since it will be Canada's largest deployment to Europe since the end of the Cold War.\n'A very dangerous game': Russia vs. Ukraine showdown reaches risky new level The Canadians will be joined in Latvia by counterparts from Italy, Spain, Poland, Albania and Slovenia, who Hetherington said will all work hand-in-hand with the Latvians on a daily basis.\n\"The Latvians will be our peers,\" he said. \"This is not building an army. We are not training them.\"\n'If push comes to shove, we can all get out' With 1 PPCLI also providing about 150 soldiers to Canada's mission in Iraq, the question remains how the government plans to find another 600 troops to send on a major peacekeeping mission in Africa.\nHetherington acknowledged that with Ukraine, Latvia and Iraq on his plate, he is \"rounds complete,\" meaning he doesn't have much more to spare.\n'Quite a formidable foe' Ukraine facing: Canadian training commander But he was confident the military would be able to find enough troops from other places to be able to participate in a peacekeeping mission, if and when the government pulls the trigger.\n\"It will depend on the task,\" Hetherington said.\n\"If push comes to shove, we can all get out the door and do what we need to do tomorrow.… If you look back to the Afghan days where at any one time we could have had upwards of 3,500, and we kept going through that.\"\n© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-14T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:32:53.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
