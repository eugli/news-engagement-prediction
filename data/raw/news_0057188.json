One of his other scheduled guests, Jeremy Scahill , even dropped out, causing Maher to respond : \n\"If Mr. Yiannopoulos is indeed the monster Scahill claims — and he might be — nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed on Friday night.\" \nWell, here we are on Wednesday, and the conservative troll has been disinvited from CPAC , lost his book deal , and resigned as Senior Editor of Breitbart News . \nHow does the HBO host feel about the booking now? He wants credit! He told The New York Times : \n\"About a week ago, I went on Van Jones's show, and somebody asked me about the booking. I hadn't really gotten into the details of Milo yet. He was just getting on my radar. I said, specifically, sunlight is the best disinfectant. Then we had Milo on, despite the fact that many people said, 'Oh, how dare you give a platform to this man.' What I think people saw was an emotionally needy Ann Coulter wannabe, trying to make a buck off of the left's propensity for outrage. And by the end of the weekend, by dinnertime Monday, he's dropped as a speaker at CPAC. Then he's dropped by Breitbart, and his book deal falls through. As I say, sunlight is the best disinfectant. You're welcome.\" \nMaher himself didn't give Milo nearly the thrashing everyone wanted to see — though a couple of his guests did — so should he really get credit? \nWe mean, it was someone else who tracked down the pedophilia comments that sparked his downfall. \nThen again, Maher inviting him on the show does seem to have put Milo beyond the tipping point; and a larger audience means more scrutiny — which sometimes leads to scandalous comments being uncovered . \nHmm. What do YOU think, Perezcious readers?? Did his appearance on Real Time facilitate his downfall? \nP.S. - Check out the results of our poll from before his appearance HERE !
