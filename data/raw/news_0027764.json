The suites, which are rented to people considered hard-to-house, were deemed unfit for human habitation. \nREAD MORE: Bedbugs, cockroaches and feces: Edmonton apartments ‘unfit for human habitation’ \nIn October, AHS issued closure notices for seven suites in the building, citing wet, damaged floors and mould growth. The order declared the residence “closed for tenant accommodation purposes” and ordered the premises vacated immediately. \nThe owner was ordered to remove material that was water damaged, conduct air quality analyses, and replace all floor coverings and walls. \n“Until such time as work referred to above is completed to the satisfaction of an executive officer of Alberta Health Services, the above noted premises shall remain closed for tenant accommodation purposes.” \nThen, in mid-January, 377 charges were laid for failing to comply with the health orders issued. \n“It is Alberta Health Services’ (AHS) duty to protect the health of Albertans, and this includes requiring that housing provided to Albertans is safe, and does not pose a risk to their health and wellness,” AHS spokesperson Kerry Williamson said in an email to Global News. \n“Alberta Health Services always attempts to work collaboratively with building owners and landlords to proactively address issues before escalating to closure or other enforcement measures or, in this case, legal action. \nAHS said, before moving forward with legal charges, staff conducted more than 100 inspections in the building, “issued four compliance letters and met several times with the property managers to discuss ongoing issues with maintenance and pest control.” \n“The property management’s lack of responsive actions created a direct and avoidable risk to the health of the tenants in the building,” the statement said. \n“The charges relate to alleged violations of the Housing Regulation and the Public Health Act that occurred between Aug. 22, 2016 and Dec. 30, 2016 involving 84 suites.” \nRents in the MacDonald Lofts were capped five years ago but were set to go up by hundreds of dollars on Nov. 1, 2016, when the cap expired. \nBut, after the AHS orders, the rent increase was rescinded. \nA Katz Group company, ICE District Joint Venture, has entered into an agreement to buy the 87-unit apartment, which is a designated historic site and cannot be torn down. \nThe company has not yet said what it will do with the property.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:57:41.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
