File photo \nMANILA, Philippines ( Philippines News Agency ) — The Senate will begin interpellation Tuesday for the proposed emergency powers for President Rodrigo Duterte. \n“We would start the plenary debates for the emergency powers so that we will finish and approve the bill at the soonest,” Sen. Grace Poe, chair of the Senate Committee on Public Services, said Monday. \nPoe expressed hope that the emergency powers would be “part of the solution” to the country’s traffic woes and other transport problems. \nUnder Committee Report No. 24 or “An Act Compelling the Government to Address the Transportation and Congestion Crisis Through the Grant of Emergency Powers to the President,” Poe noted that alternative methods could be used to speed up implementation of key transportation projects.
