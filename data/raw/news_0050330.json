Juventus Extinguish Dragons' Flame Porto finished second in Group G, and their reward was a round-of-16 matchup opposite a Juventus side that's rediscovered its charm under manager Massimiliano Allegriâ€”if it was ever lostâ€”and is unbeaten in Europe this season. Centre-back Medhi Benatiaâ€”on loan from Bayern Munichâ€”isn't expecting an easy trip to Portugal come Wednesday, however, and he told Sky Sports Italia (h/t Football Italia ) of the challenge facing the Turin club: \nThere are no easy games in the Champions League and Porto are accustomed to playing at this level and in this tournament. \nWe are well aware it wonâ€™t be a simple task. There are strong ambitions for this season and we want to go all the way in the Champions League. This is a very important period of the campaign for us and weâ€™re ready for it. That being said, with the Bianconeri enjoying a six-match winning streak, it's fair to say Juventus enter the Estadio do Dragao as fancied favourites to take a result from the first leg. The Dragons have scored in every home league fixture this season, however, and the Champions League Twitter account recently noted it's mostly Juventus' home form that's made them terrifying this season: Champions League @ChampionsLeague 2/18/2017, 9:33:42 PM Porto sit second in the Primeira Liga while Juventus currently rule the Serie A roost, meaning this round-of-16 duel could be between two teams who go on to collect their respective domestic crowns this term. However, Italian titans Juve hold the aces up their sleeve in terms of world-class quality across the pitch, and their form of late suggests Allegri won't allow his side to crumble at this stage. Prediction: Porto 1-2 Juventus Sevilla Dampen Leicester's European Spirits Ranieri's Leicester dropped to a 1-0 defeat at Millwall on Saturday. Clive Rose/Getty Images Leicester City are hoping a fairytale run in Europe akin to the one that netted them last season's Premier League title can salvage what's been an otherwise horrific season thus far, typified by Saturday's FA Cup exit at Millwall. Sat 17th in England's top flight, Leicester's title prospects look slim, while a 2-0 victory over Eibar saw Sevilla's shock charge on La Liga continue as they temporarily moved into second in the standings: LaLiga @LaLigaEN FT #SevillaFCEibar 2-0 Sevilla keep a third consecutive clean sheet to move provisionally into second place. ðŸ’ª https://t.co/srm3De3L2J 2/18/2017, 9:36:37 PM Two teams having near opposite campaigns as far as silverware hopes go, Leicester need to clinch a result at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan on Wednesday if their Champions League dream is to endure, but that may be a stretch too far. Saturday's 1-0 defeat at 10-man Millwall was but the latest chapter in a worsening plummet in form for the club, leading former Fox Gary Lineker to criticise manager Claudio Ranieri's decision to prioritise Europe so heavily: Gary Lineker @GaryLineker Great to be in the @ChampionsLeague but the obsession with a competition that there's zero chance of winning has hugely damaged @LCFC season 2/18/2017, 5:13:45 PM Having beaten the likes of Porto, Club Brugge and Copenhagen in Group G, Leicester are likely to find the level of competition will take on a drastic increase in the round of 16. Sevilla have conceded just 11 times at home in La Liga this season, while Leicester failed to bag in their trips to Copenhagen and Porto, meaning we could see another one-sided scoreline emerge on Wednesday.
