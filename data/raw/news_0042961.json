(Michael Reaves/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, February 20, 2017, 12:08 AM \nIt looks like the Kings’ All-Star center is going to Boogie his way right out of Sacramento. \nThe Kings have reportedly agreed to trade DeMarcus “Boogie” Cousins to the New Orleans Pelicans, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical. \nIn exchange for Cousins, the Pelicans will send a 2017 first-round draft pick, a 2017 second-round pick, guard Buddy Hield, swingman Tyreke Evan and point guard Langston Galloway. \nSacramento is also sending Omri Casspi to the Pelicans as part of the deal. \nTrade speculation, which was brewing all day Sunday, escalated when Cousins only played two minutes in Sunday night’s NBA All-Star Game. \nCousins will join fellow All-Star big man Anthony Davis in the New Orleans frontcourt. Davis is fresh off winning the All-Star Game MVP award, scoring a game-record 52 points. \nCousins is averaging 27.8 points and 19.7 rebounds per game this season. \nCousins, 26, who has always displayed a lot of emotion during his seven-year NBA career, is facing a one-game suspension for picking up his 16th technical foul of the season last week.
