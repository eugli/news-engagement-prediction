Both teams announced the deal Sunday afternoon. \nPhillips will come to Atlanta to fill a void that developed late last week, when the Braves became more concerned about the lingering effects of a left shoulder ailment Sean Rodriguez sustained during a Jan. 28 car accident. \nThe Reds will pay nearly all of the $14 million Phillips is owed as he enters the final year of his contract. Their desire to move their long-tenured veteran was rooted in their plan to use former Braves top prospect Jose Peraza and Dilson Herrera as their primary second basemen this season. Statcast: Phillips goes airborne CIN@PIT: Phillips' 0.30-second first step robs hit Statcast measures Brandon Phillips' first step, distance covered and route efficiency as he takes away a base hit \nMLB Network insider Ken Rosenthal first reported a deal was in the works on Saturday evening. The Braves haven't specifically addressed the severity of Rodriguez's shoulder ailment, but Rosenthal has reported the versatile infielder will need surgery that could sideline him for three-to-five months. \nAs a 10-and-5 player, Phillips blocked trades to the Nationals and D-backs last year and then used this same privilege to veto at least one potential deal with the Braves earlier this offseason. The 35-year-old suburban Atlanta native first blocked a trade to his hometown team in November, a short time before the Braves gave Rodriguez a two-year deal with the expectation that he would serve as their primary second baseman at least until Ozzie Albies -- the No. 2 second baseman in the Minors, per MLBPipeline.com -- is deemed Major League ready. \nPhillips spent the last 11 seasons in Cincinnati, including all three of his All-Star campaigns. He hit .291/.320/.416 with 11 home runs, 64 RBIs and 14 stolen bases in 141 games in 2016. Phillips' two-homer game CIN@PIT: Phillips hits two homers vs. Pirates Brandon Phillips hits solo home runs, one in the 2nd and another in the 7th inning against the Pirates \nWith Phillips leaving, the Reds have achieved one of their major offseason goals in trying to clear a middle infield spot. Both Peraza and Herrera -- who was acquired from the Mets for Jay Bruce in August -- will compete for that opening. Peraza, who batted .324 for the Reds last season, would appear to have the inside track. The team has also made efforts this offseason to move shortstop Zack Cozart . If Cozart is dealt, Peraza and Herrera would form Cincinnati's new middle infield. \nMcKirahan compiled a 5.93 ERA in the 27 appearances he made for Atlanta in 2015 before being suspended for testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. The 27-year-old southpaw missed last year while recovering from Tommy John surgery. \nPortuondo produced a 3.63 ERA over 34 2/3 innings for Double-A Mississippi and Triple-A Gwinnett last year. The 29-year-old pitched in his native Cuba before coming to the United States to join the Braves' organization last year. has covered the Braves for MLB.com since 2001.
