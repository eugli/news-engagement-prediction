It also saw 14 RBB members suspended by the club. Just spoke to Graham he hasn't heard from anyone at WSW. He isn't on social media. Just call him. Easy as that. https://t.co/eau1GhSgrG — Tony Pignata (@tpignata9) February 24, 2017 Spoke to @wswanderersfc CEO John Tsatsimas JT called Arnie late yesterday which wasn't answered JT and I go back a long way Time to move on https://t.co/cz5Zrq9Bwg — Tony Pignata (@tpignata9) February 24, 2017 \nOn Thursday, Tsatsimas ruled out a club apology to Arnold , but after the club finalised their review of the events that took place before Sydney’s 1-0 loss to Western Sydney, Wanderers Chairman Paul Lederer issued the below statement. \n“Unfortunately the events of the last week have overshadowed what we should be celebrating as a fantastic event between Sydney’s two A-League teams,” said Mr Lederer. Banner displayed by the RBB during the Sydney Derby. Source: Supplied \n“It is with great disappointment that the actions of a minority have prompted fairly stern action to be taken by the Club this week to eradicate anti-social behaviour. \n“On behalf of the Western Sydney Wanderers, we apologise to Graham Arnold and his family and to all others who have been offended by the abhorrent actions of a few who are now no longer part of our Club. \n“We urge everyone now to come together and celebrate the great event that the Sydney Derby has become and to attend future A-League matches in the right sporting spirit.” \nTsatsimas told 2GB on Thursday: “We don’t apologise for the behaviour. \n“It wasn’t an official, it wasn’t conducted by a player ... \n“We [The Wanderers] won’t take responsibility for the poor actions of others.” \nFour days after the incident, Arnold said he would have liked an apology but never recieved one. \n“Apology? I would probably have liked one by now,” said Arnold. “I haven’t heard from them for four days so I don’t want one now. At the end of the day I would have hoped I would have got an apology, but I didn’t get one. That’s life and we just move on.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
