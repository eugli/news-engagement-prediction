Jared Payne has been out of action since fracturing a kidney against Australia in November Payne back training but waiting for medical all-clear \nUlster skills coach Niall Malone revealed that Jared Payne has been back training for a couple of weeks but is waiting on the all-clear from doctors as he recovers from the fractured kidney he sustained in Ireland's win over Australia in late November. \n\"He says he's fine but if he got a big bang in that area, it could be serious,\" added Malone. \n\"So it's up to the doctors and medical staff.\" \nWith Ulster facing Treviso on 3 March before the re-arranged home game against Zebre on 11 March, Les Kiss' side look capable of continuing their return to form over the next number of weeks. \n\"We play the best three teams in the league over the last three weekend of the competition - and not saying we can't beat those teams - but it would be nice to have a cushion or a buffer before we reach those concluding games,\" continued Malone. Media playback is not supported on this device Tommy Bowe Pienaar says energy back in Ulster squad \nPienaar's sensational try as he returned after six weeks out because of a knee injury was the highlight of Ulster's win over the champions of two seasons ago. \nAfter a dreadful run of form which saw nine defeats in 13 games, Pienaar, 32, says that belief has returned to the squad following the back-to-back wins over Edinburgh and Glasgow. \n\"You can feel there is a bit of a change of energy and that the guys are felling really positive after last weekend,\" the Springboks star told BBC Sport Northern Ireland. \n\"I hadn't played since 31 December and it was great to get back on to the field at the Kingspan.\" \nPienaar started and finished the length-of-the-field move which culminated in his try and he ended up playing the entire game after fly-half Peter Nelson was forced off early in the second half. \n\"I didn't expect to get the full 80 minutes but it was great to come out of the game alright and the knee felt fine,\" added Pienaar, who switched to fly-half after Nelson's departure. Marcell Coetzee's introduction has helped breath hope into Ulster's season Pienaar hails Coetzee impact \nPienaar believes the introduction of his fellow Springbok Marcell Coetzee has made a \"massive difference\" to the province over the past two weeks. \nCoetzee signed for Ulster last summer but a knee injury then delayed his debut for over six months. \n\"His aggressive nature, his physicality has made a big difference to our pack. He's an energy ball on the pitch and gets the guys around him going as well. He has been absolutely outstanding.\" \nWhile Coetzee is only beginning his Ulster career, Pienaar's time at Kingspan Stadium is coming towards an end and the half-back admits that he is \"cherishing every moment\". \n\"I know I've only got a handful of games left and the emotion is going to kick in as the end nears.\" \nPienaar, who has been linked with French club Montpellier, says he knows his destination for next season but that he is not in a position to confirm the details yet. \n\"I think that will probably be announced in a few weeks,\" added the South African.
