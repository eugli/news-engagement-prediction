Tight-oil production from unlocking previously inaccessible shale resources using fracking has become America's energy answer to OPEC and Russia.\nIt's a relief that the world price of oil has settled in at around $55 to $60 a barrel and not higher. With oil prices nearly doubling in the last year, the last thing we need is a trend that makes them rise even faster.\nYet that's what would have happened had it not been for a significant increase in U.S. tight-oil production, with output rising to nearly 5 million barrels per day in 2015, accounting for more than half of U.S. oil production.\nAlthough shale-oil production began to tail off last year in North Dakota's Bakken field and Eagle Ford in South Texas, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that total tight-oil production will rise by 80,000 barrels per day in March, thanks to increased production in the Permian shale play of West Texas and New Mexico.\nCredit for this goes to continuing improvements in drilling and extraction technologies, which have made fracking more efficient and lowered its cost per well. Wells have turned into superwells. Oil drillers are using better mixes of sand, water and chemicals. Lateral drilling is reaching new sources of shale oil and gas several miles into previously inaccessible shale rock.\n\"Walking rigs\" that can move from one location to another are increasingly being used, dramatically reducing the time to drill new wells and saving millions of dollars in drilling costs. And data analytics are enabling companies to bypass inefficient shale plays.\nIt's no surprise then that new wells in the Permian Basin produced 3.4 times as many barrels of oil in January than wells in the region were producing in January 2014, when oil prices were at their peak. But the Utica Shale in Ohio has shown the greatest improvement in efficiency, with wells producing 4.2 times as many barrels of oil than they did three years ago.\nAnd newly drilled natural gas wells in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia are now producing on average 13,000 cubic feet of gas daily, compared to 4,500 cubic feet a day in 2012.\nProducers believe that production of tight oil (another term for shale oil) could reach 11 million barrels per day, or two-thirds of total U.S. oil output, by 2040 or sooner. But make no mistake, for tight oil to reach its full potential and for the U.S. to maintain its new status as a world energy superpower, fracking regulations must come from state officials who have the expertise and experience with shale formations, and not the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nOPEC and Russian oil ministers must be gritting their teeth at the astonishing increase in U.S. oil and natural gas production, which has kept a check on price spikes. Witness the relatively low and stable prices of gasoline, diesel and other petroleum products. OPEC countries are starting to wonder whom they should believe about the world price of oil â€” the reassuring Saudis or the worrisome numbers.\nHere at home, a lot of U.S. politicians who have been waving the anti-fracking banner for years are backing off quietly now. This trend was not unexpected, considering the enormous economic stimulus that the shale bonanza has delivered to the U.S. economy, in addition to making the country more energy secure than in several generations.\nAnd for the first time since the 1970s the United States is holding its own in competition with OPEC and Russia for energy production. Thanks to America's shale resources, which are now accessible with state-of-the-art, made-in-the-USA technologies that keep improving with startlingly rapid progress, U.S. oil production has proved more resilient to price drops than our competitors ever expected.\nThat achievement may prove to be the most valuable benefit from America's surging energy production in recent decades.\nPerry is a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a professor of economics at the Flint campus of the University of Michigan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:19:23.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
