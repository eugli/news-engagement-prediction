Ad Feedback \nSpark has discussed opening up Lightbox by turning it into a platform that could sell programmes owned by other television companies alongside its own content. \nHowever, an industry source said it would not be practical to combine the two services into a single offering. \n\"For a start, you would have to agree which would be the lesser brand.\" \nSpark could use what it regards as a highly successful partnership with streaming music service Spotify as a model for a looser arrangement that saw the internet television services provided side-by-side. \nSpark effectively resells Spotify by bundling it for free with its higher-value mobile and broadband plans. \nA partnership between the country's largest phone company and the world's largest internet television firm might appear ironic, coming on the heels of the Commerce Commission's decision on Thursday not to clear Sky Television's planned merger with Vodafone. \nHowever, commission chairman Mark Berry said that its concern with the Sky/Vodafone merger was Sky Sports, and it saw the market for all other programming as \"highly competitive\". \nVodafone spokeswoman Andrea Brady would not comment on a suggestion from Sky TV chief executive John Fellet that the two companies could deepen their existing partnership, outside a merger.​ \nFellet has suggested Sky TV could still source a new generation of set-top boxes from Vodafone in Europe. \nThese would receive programming over ultrafast broadband, store recorded programmes \"in the cloud\" rather than on a hard drive, and include a much-improved electronic programming guide (EPG) that would make it easier to discover programmes. \nBerry's comments also appear to hold the door open for Sky and Vodafone to enter into exclusive agreements to supply Sky's non-sports programming to Vodafone broadband and mobile customers. \nSky TV and Vodafone have until 20 working days after the commission releases its detail reasons for declining the merger to decide whether to appeal the commission's decision to the High Court. \nBut the prospects of an appeal are already being discounted. \nWhile expressing disappointment at the commission's ruling, Fellet has likened an appeal to \"root canal work\" and questioned what the grounds for an appeal might be. \nGalpin said an appeal could take 18 months even before any subsequent appeal to a higher court. \nEven if a legal challenge was ultimately successful, the benefits of the merger might not be there for both parties at the end of that process, given the nature of sport rights, he said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:14:05.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
