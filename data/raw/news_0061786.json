By Aakar Rastogi , ECONOMICTIMES.COM | Updated: Feb 22, 2017, 06.11 PM IST Is Modi on a road to nowhere in Uttar Pradesh? Untimely demise of an investor brings his/her nominee into the picture. Often the nominee would not be familiar with various investments , including mutual funds . The nominee must fulfil a host of formalities to transfer the mutual fund holdings in his/her name and to sell those investments. The requirements vary with every fund house, but here is a list that would be enough for most individuals. Death Certificate is a legal requirement, needed to prove the death of the investor. \"You need to submit a notorised copy of the death certificate,\" says Pallav Agarwal, certified financial planner, WeFlourish. Fund houses usually insist on an attested copy of the death certificate. Transmission Form should be filled up to transfer mutual fund units to the name of the nominee. \"Nominee cannot directly redeem the mutual fund investment. He is first required to get the units transferred in his name,\" says Rajesh Bhatia, a mutual fund advisor based in Delhi. You can give a written application, if the fund house doesn't follow any particular format. KYC and FATCA Forms should be filled by the nominee to transfer mutual fund units in his/her name. The nominee must comply with the Know Your Customer (KYC) and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) regulations. KYC basically asks to verify the identity of the person and the address proof along with a photograph. And FATCA requires some basic information whether the person holds any financial assets or income in any foreign country or not. The person must also submit a cancelled cheque to link his bank account for the redemption proceeds. Indemnity Bond is another requirement in some mutual funds. \"One of my clients had to give an indemnity bond to Sundaram AMC while getting the units transferred in his name,\" says Agarwal. By asking for an affidavit or an indemnity bond, the fund house basically wants to legally protect itself from situations where a legal heir or any other person contests the transfer of the units in the name of the nominee. \"It usually takes around seven to 10 working days to get the units transferred in your name,\" says Bhatia. Once the mutual fund units are transferred in the nominee's name, he can either choose to continue with the investment or sell them in full or part as per the requirement. A separate redemption request should be placed online or in paper to sell the investments. The redemption procedure is usually completed within two to three working days.
