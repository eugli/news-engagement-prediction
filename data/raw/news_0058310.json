It also seeks the names of the nonprofit's donors and the keys to its endowment. And it wants to make clear that WLRN exists to support the communications programs of Miami-Dade public schools, a mission far different from that of a credible news outlet.

So, too, could television funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) be at risk. That's because both national entities only support programming free of government influence. And both are closely watching the developments in South Florida. \nWLRN also risks losing journalists who've won dozens of state and national awards in recent years for their coverage of our big, diverse and complex region. A number of them say they will quit if the district's proposed operating agreement goes through. You can bet all will pursue other jobs. \nYou can also bet the district will be hard-pressed to recruit similar high-calibre journalists, no matter its promise of uncompromising journalistic integrity. For like most people, reporters want to please their bosses. And who would be crazy enough to pursue a story about drop-outs, detentions or, God forbid, unappetizing food in school cafeterias? We hear that last story, reported by a Miami-Dade schools intern under the supervision of a WLRN editor, made the district see red. \nRather than take on the business of broadcasting — and absorb the salaries of a 19-member newsroom — you'd think Miami-Dade Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho would have enough to worry about given his challenges with student performance, school grades, charter school competition, teacher recruitment and a political climate that increasingly views public schools with a jaundiced eye. \nAt a time when he most needs the public's good will, Carvalho risks outraging citizens who depend on public broadcasting — especially local public radio — to help tell the stories of our communities, our governments and our lives. \nWLRN's members, donors and program underwriters should similarly be alarmed by Carvalho's power play. Does he not understand that WLRN has grown its audience and donor base by producing credible reporting not censored by government oversight? Does he not understand that trust can be lost overnight? \nCarvalho backing off some demands \nIn an interview with the Sun Sentinel Editorial Board late Tuesday, Carvalho said he did not draft the proposed operating agreement, that his staff did. He said he does not intend for the school district to run WLRN and promises the station will emerge stronger, better and more independent than ever. He says the proposed agreement was simply the opening salvo in a negotiation. \nBut he also believes the nonprofit lacks transparency and accountability. He doesn't like that WLRN's salaries are not publicized. He says he only cares about executive salaries, though his staff wants to see those of journalists, too. \nAn ugly audit about five years ago revealed a WLRN account underwriter made about $400,000 a year, which is clearly over the top. But Dwight Hill, the president of Sabadell United Bank and volunteer chairman of Friends of WLRN, says salaries have been significantly adjusted since then. Even still, he's reluctant to release salary information for competitive purposes. \nMostly, Carvalho is frustrated — rightfully so — about misrepresentations Friends made in federal financial statements. He said he fears the misstatements could jeopardize the station's future funding, threaten its license and risk taxpayers having to pay fines. \n\"This didn't start out as a power grab,\" Carvalho said. \"This started out as a detection of egregious financial issues that led to the discovery of this shadow entity, created by Friends, not known to us … that has been engaged in financial dealings that spooked the federal government and will result in financial fines because of a series of hidden transactions and misreporting.\" \nHill, the nonprofit's board chairman, says no one is alleging theft or criminal behavior. Rather, he said the chief financial officer over-reported sales revenues on the TV side and under-reported those on the radio side, which likely drew bigger grants from CPB. As soon as the issue came to light, he said the school district and federal officials were notified, the station sought a forensic audit and the CFO tendered his resignation. He says the station will likely have to refund money to CPB, but no fines have been mentioned. \nHill notes that a school board member sits on the board of Friends, so the school district has had full access to its financials. \nSchool district's role in WLRN \nThe district's ownership of WLRN's broadcasting license goes back to 1948, when the federal government gave schools and universities slices of the airwaves to provide educational programming for those unable to attend class. \nBecause of the challenges in the business of broadcasting, many big-city school districts — including in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles — have transferred their public radio and television licenses to community foundations committed to serving the public good. \nSuch an outcome would best serve the citizens of South Florida, too, given that WLRN's audience now extends far beyond the boundaries of Miami-Dade schools. \nBut from what we know, the district doesn't want to let go because there's money to be made in leasing part of its spectrum. \nNew muscle in WLRN's newsroom \nGiven the sweep of WLRN's news operation today, it's easy to forget that until 15 years ago, it offered little more than a rip-and-read newscaster who peppered programming with top-of-the-hour headlines. \nIn 2003, things changed — for the better — when the station entered a collaborative partnership with the Miami Herald. The deal called for four Herald reporters to create radio content and for the two entities to split the proceeds from the program's sponsorship dollars. \nHowever, when the McClatchy Company bought the Herald from Knight-Ridder, Inc., in 2006, it wanted nothing to do with radio. And so it was that Friends of WLRN created a nonprofit subsidiary — called South Florida Public Media — to employ the reporters and ensure their independence. This is the organization that Carvalho calls a \"shadow entity.\" \nDaisy Gonzalez-Diego, the school district's communications director, says Friends never received school board permission to create the subsidiary. And now that the district is aware, it has many concerns beyond the financial irregularities. \nFor one thing, the station's news staff doesn't submit to district hiring practices, including the Level 2 criminal background check required of employees who work with school children. As a result, the district has suspended the internship program that spawned that cafeteria story. Surprisingly, she said employees at the 700 or so businesses that work with Miami-Dade interns undergo Level 2 background checks, which include fingerprint checks. \nHill says Friends of WLRN conducts pre-employment background checks, but if the district wants a higher level of screening, its journalists will submit tomorrow. The district, however, isn't interested. It first wants its operating agreement signed. So you've got to wonder, are background checks the real issue? Or is this about control? \nGonzalez-Diego insists the district has \"no intention of silencing journalists, or going against the First Amendment. That's not what this is about.\" She says a 2002 editorial integrity policy adopted between the district and WLRN would prevent her from influencing how the school board's journalists would do their jobs. She also says the district's HR department will decide which reporters get to keep their jobs, though the draft proposal clearly puts her in charge. \"If the question is, will we not hire someone who's done a negative story, that's not the case. Our intent is not to stifle public speech or reporting ability.\" \nGonzalez-Diego acknowledges that's she's complained about WLRN's coverage of the district, \"just like I have with Channel 7 or 10. I have spoken to the news director. When you're a PIO (public information officer) for a school district, if you find a story is not accurate, you will call and say \"I don't believe you were fair.\" \nWhile WLRN's news director and general manager declined to comment, multiple sources tell us Gonzalez-Diego regularly calls the station to complain about stories she considers negative or about the station not covering the positive news the district wants communicated. \nIt's not uncommon for editors or news directors to field angry calls from government officials. But you've got to believe there's an unspoken subtext when the owner of the station's license calls. \nWe shall see how this all turns out. Carvalho says he may tap journalism luminaries, including former Miami Herald publishers David Lawrence and Alberto Ibarquen, to help establish a structure that creates a journalistic firewall between the news station and the school board. \nSo it appears the Miami-Dade school district has blinked. \nStill, by proposing this ham-handed operating agreement, the district poorly treated a nonprofit friend that has supported public broadcasting for more than 40 years. It also needlessly threatened the livelihoods of 19 journalists doing great work at WLRN. \nWork relationships are like marriages. They need tending on both sides. \nIn this long-term marriage, Carvalho overreacted by proposing an agreement that had all the hallmarks of a divorce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:22:26.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
