The anonymous investor has forked out £21 million for the asset, working out at around £150,000 per space, making it the largest parking-related transaction ever recorded in the UK. The off-market deal was confirmed by Milton Stone and Nicolas Van Patrick, two high-end Knightsbridge estate agencies which were joint agents on the mega-sale. Sacha Moussaieff, director at Milton Stone, said: 'We had been discreetly offering the spaces either individually or as one lot and completed the sale for £20 million in January. The anonymous investor has forked out £21 million for the asset, working out at around £150,000 per space The car park on Kensington Road is a stone's throw from Harrod's and has already had a makeover fit for a king 'It is unique. In the 20 years I have been in the industry I've not seen an opportunity to buy ten spaces, let alone 130. This marks a fantastic start to 2017 for Milton Stone.' The car park, a stone's throw from Harrod's has already had a makeover fit for a king. The royal's 80 cars will have the luxury of extra wide bays, cushioned pillars, a car grooming service, and 24-hr security guards. It means his fleet will be protected in the run up to supercar season which starts in August. The month traditionally sees a host of flashy supercars shipped over to the UK by their Arab-owners. But they cause a headache for residents who complain of noise pollution and parking congestion. On display: A row of stunning supercars line up outside designer shops Versace and Fendi in Sloane Street, west London last summer From chrome Mercedes-Benz McLarens to silver Lamborghini Aventador, the stunning vehicles descend on Knightsbridge and Chelsea. But Kensington and Chelsea council announced their first ever prosecutions of 'nuisance' supercar owners in December dishing out up to £1,000 fines for drivers who raced around the boroughs playing loud music and revving their engines. Mr Moussaieff would not discuss the buyer or their intended use for the car park, but said investors are looking at fresh ways to make money in the property market. The royal's 80 cars will have the luxury of extra wide bays, cushioned pillars, a car grooming service, and 24-hr security guards The £150,000 per space price is around the same as a brand-new McLaren 570S or Porsche 911 Turbo S He added: 'Parking is very difficult in the area so if you have money to invest in London then garages and spaces are a good proposition.' The £150,000 per space price is around the same as a brand-new McLaren 570S or Porsche 911 Turbo S. At £20 million, it is the same as a 6,500sq/ft period home in Belgravia with each space costing the same as a two-bedroom terrace in Taunton, Somerset. Patrick Alvarado, director at Nicolas van Patrick, said: 'When it comes to the sales market in prime central London, we predict trading conditions to remain challenging for 2017 although quarter one has seen us get off to a very good start.' A spokesman for Waterbridge Estates who sold the exclusive car park told The Times the buyer actually got a bargain. 'The value of his collection is significantly higher than the price he has paid for parking.' The agent added: 'A car park in central London is being sold for more than entire streets and villages outside the capital's centre and yet even upper middle class generations are finding it impossible to rent in London, let alone purchase in their lifetime.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:37:59.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
