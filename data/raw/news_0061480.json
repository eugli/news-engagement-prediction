Hunt, at Upton Boxing Center in Baltimore. Ford, the model for the character Cutty in “The Wire,” coaches Gervonta Davis, a junior lightweight champion. Credit Matt Roth for The New York Times BALTIMORE — The FedEx package containing the junior lightweight championship belt, intended for Gervonta Davis, arrived at the gym too early in the day. Davis often trains late into the night, running the streets of Baltimore, and sleeps until midday. So it was his coach Calvin Ford — he sleeps much less, sometimes just an hour a night — who found the attempted-delivery note when he got to Upton Boxing Center, a gym in one of the city’s most blighted neighborhoods. Ford, along with Kenny Ellis, another of Davis’s coaches, runs the training sessions at Upton five nights a week, showing young people the angles of the trade and keeping them off the same streets that Davis makes his training ground. The coaches have been involved with fighting, in one way or another, for most of their lives. Ellis, 49, is a bearded former amateur boxer who has coached at Upton since 2005. And Ford, 52, was once a violent lieutenant in the Boardley-Burrows drug organization, which controlled parts of West Baltimore in the 1980s.

If I had to beat you up with my hands, I’d beat you up with my hands.” In 1988, Ford was convicted of racketeering and conspiracy. He served 10 years in a federal prison, where he learned to box. He started coaching after he was released, eventually cultivating a national amateur champion. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story That attracted the attention of Ed Burns, a police detective who had investigated Ford — and who became one of the creators of the HBO series “The Wire.” He used Ford as a model for the character known as Cutty, an ex-con who opened a gym after realizing that the streets he returned to had grown harder than he could handle. Today, Ford is a soft-spoken man who wears track suits and reading glasses secured by a bejeweled chain, a jarringly endearing detail for someone who teaches others how to inflict pain efficiently. And he is a father figure to dozens of children who have been coming to him for nearly two decades for lessons that reach far beyond a three-minute round. Davis, his first world champion, and the youngest living professional titleholder, has been called the future of boxing by no less an authority than Floyd Mayweather Jr. When Davis, 22, entered the gym a few hours later to find a heavily taped cardboard box on the reception desk, it was Ford who handed him the scissors. Inside was a deep-red belt with a large gold logo of the International Boxing Federation, earned with a seventh-round knockout of José Pedraza, who was heavily favored, in Brooklyn on Jan. 14. “Strap me up,” Davis said through a stifled grin. Ford, wearing a beanie with #STRAPSEASON printed on the front, put the belt on the 5-foot-6, 130-pound Davis. The new champion posed for a picture under banners that included Angelo Ward, who trained here before he was shot to death in 2012, and a scowling version of Davis’s younger self, draped in belts and medals a decade ago. Now, with a new belt over his shoulder, Davis glowed. “I might walk up and down the avenue,” he said, gesturing to the street outside.

So far this year, the city is averaging nearly a murder a day. Ford and Ellis know children who were — and still are — linked to those troubling statistics. Children, forced to fend for themselves after the killing of a parent, slipping into the current of incarceration. Young men with no prospects other than the easiest one available — the economy of addiction. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Davis, whose mother struggled with drug abuse during his youth and whose father spent time in prison for selling drugs, is one of the fortunate ones. Others have not been so lucky. “Kids fall out of school because they saw the kid that they hang with get gunned down in the street,” Ellis said. After witnessing a murder, “you got to go to school the next day!” he added. “How can you do a test? How can you pass?” The kids who come through the gym’s doors at least have a chance to learn how to cope with the hopelessness outside, where, Ellis said, violence claims “a body every day.” “Sometimes you hear gunshots, you look around the gym, like, ‘We got some in here that ain’t getting shot,’” he said. Upton is not far from where Freddie Gray was arrested in 2015, leading to the ride in a police van that left him with a spinal cord injury that killed him a week later. The drugstore that was looted and burned during the riots after his funeral is six blocks away. The neighborhood has the largest percentage of returning criminal offenders in the state, said Nick Mosby, a former mayoral candidate and City Council member who is now a state legislator. “Any barometer of success of a community, unfortunately in that ZIP code, will typically tilt towards a very unhealthy community,” said Mosby, whose wife, Marilyn, was the state’s attorney who prosecuted the Baltimore police officers charged in Gray’s death. (None were convicted.) “Poverty level, education level, unemployment rate, health disparities, you name it.” Mosby said the children here were facing adult issues. “At the age of 7, 8, 9, 10, they’re taking care of themselves, they’re taking care of younger siblings, they’re going out, figuring out what they’re going to eat every day.” Continue reading the main story Photo Training at Upton.

The city funds the gym, though for many years Ford helped out of his own pocket — including paying for trips to out-of-town competitions. \nAdvertisement “You don’t know how many cars I ran through,” Ford said, laughing. Such sacrifice has helped generate good will in the community. Upton stands apart. “You notice when you walked up on the corners, you ain’t see nobody standin’ on my corners,” Ford said. “They ain’t gonna have that nonsense around us. That show you that the people — city, street people — cares about what we are doing.” Even with Davis’s success, and the national attention it has brought to Upton, the loss of previous fighters — those who the coaches said decided to “go left” and give in to the streets — weighs heavy. Ray Davis, a fighter Ellis trained as a teenager, is in jail after ending up on his own when his father was shot at a corner store. Ronald Gibbs, a 17-year-old nationally ranked amateur, was stabbed in the heart in 2012 in a dispute defending his sister. That same year, Ward, the fighter under whose banner Gervonta Davis had his picture taken, was shot nine times. He was two fights into his professional career. “Every day, his friends would come here and wait for him to finish training so they could run the streets,” Ellis said of Ward. “I said, ‘Man, you can’t have one foot in the streets and one foot in the gym. It’s not gonna work.’” The day that Ward was killed, Ellis said, he was in his car when he received the text. “And where he got killed was like three minutes from where I was driving, so I drove around there. And they had the yellow tape around him.” History of Fighting After locking his belt in its case, Gervonta (pronounced Jer-VON-tay) Davis drove a few blocks northwest and stood in front of the home he once shared with his mother and grandmother, a bitter wind tunnel of a block dotted with abandoned rowhouses. Garbage spilled into an alley framed by a rowhouse with no roof. An open Bible lay on a stoop, its pages fluttering. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Davis pointed out a cactus a few doors down. He used to touch it every day as he walked to and from the elementary school at the end of the block, a child’s personal challenge to himself ahead of a career of stinging hands. When he was 7, Davis and one of his older brothers moved in with his grandmother, after bouncing between a group home and their uncle’s house. Being new to West Baltimore, the boys were quickly forced to defend themselves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T12:04:01.910+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
