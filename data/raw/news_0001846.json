My baby has a red rash. Do I have depression? What are the symptoms of breast cancer? How do I get rid of a migraine? These days, millions of the people consult Google every day about health issues before they even think about going to a doctor, but the responses may not be reliable. Now, the search engine is launching a service that aims to increase the trustworthiness of the answers to medical questions people ask on the web. Dr Google has launched a new health card to provide Australians with accurate information about the condition, symptoms and diagnosis fact checked by a panel of qualified doctors From today, searches on around 900 common health complaints will retrieve 'Health Condition Cards' that display information that has been fact-checked by a panel of qualified doctors and the Mayo Clinic. A similar feature was introduced in the United States in 2015. Google has partnered with Australian groups and is using local data to tailor responses to better suit Australian users, project manager Isobel Solaqua told The Sydney Morning Herald. The feature will include an outline of the condition, symptoms, diagnosis, and prevalence according to age at the top of search results. Australians can now trust that Dr Google is providing them with reliable health information The feature, launched by the internet giant on Wednesday, will show accurate information For some conditions you'll also see high-quality illustrations from licensed medical illustrators. With one in 20 online searches related to health, Google says they want to empower their users.
