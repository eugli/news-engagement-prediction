It is, however, hard to see from a distance. And so, activists decided to make their faith in the country's open arms loud and clear, mounting a 20-foot banner that reads \"Refugees Welcome\" on the Statue of Liberty's observation deck on Tuesday. \nBecause hanging anything from the Statue of Liberty is illegal for obvious reasons, not to mention unsafe, the sign was swiftly removed by the National Park Service hours later. Observers were swifter still, though, capturing the message and posting the evidence to social media. \nAccording to CNN , an activist group called Alt Lady Liberty claimed responsibility for the act, stating, \"Almost all Americans have descendants from somewhere else. Immigrants and refugees make this country great. And turning away refugees, like we did to Anne Frank, does not make us great. Refugees are welcome here, Muslims are welcome here and immigrants are welcome here ... We wanted to send a reminder about America when we're at our best -- the country that's a beacon of freedom to the world, built by immigrants. Walling off countries or entire religions is against our values. That's what the Statue of Liberty stands for.\" Loading View on Instagram \nThe activist imagery—which is reminiscent of the \"Resist\" banner made to hang in view of the White House last month —comes amidst a flurry of controversial immigration policies put forth by President Donald Trump's administration. This week, the Department of Homeland Security announced its intention to double down on the enforcement of immigration restrictions, just days after Trump revealed upcoming plans to sign a new executive order to replace the travel ban that was previously suspended by federal courts .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:46:39.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
