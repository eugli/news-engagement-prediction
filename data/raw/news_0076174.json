The remembrance will include a dedication that opens the episode. \nPaxton's death does not affect production of Training Day 's first season as the midseason entry wrapped production on its 13 episodes in December. But Paxton's passing casts a shadow over the series' future as he was the big star and ratings have been unimpressive through four weeks. \nTraining Day's Bill Paxton gets into the mind of his character \nIn Training Day , Paxton played detective Frank Roarke, a veteran cop who goes about his job his own way, sparking controversy. He's paired with young officer Kyle Craig ( Justin Cornwell ), who's planted as Roarke's partner to keep an eye on him for higher ups at the department. \nThis is the second CBS drama to lose one of its stars already this year. NCIS: Los Angeles star Miguel Ferrer passed away on Jan. 19. He'll be remembered in the Mar. 5 episode. \nTraining Day airs Thursdays at 10/9c on CBS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:02:35.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
