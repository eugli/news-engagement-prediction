Published in full in 1922, the novel parallels Homer’s “Odyssey” in a dense stream-of-consciousness sojourn by Leopold Bloom, a Jewish immigrant from Hungary, through his adopted Dublin on June 16, 1904. Photo Mr. Delaney’s book “James Joyce’s Odyssey: A Guide to the Dublin of ‘Ulysses.’” Credit Henry Holt & Co The book was banned as obscene, criticized as chaotic, dissected to death and pronounced a modernist masterpiece — “a vast, entertaining, funny, absorbing, exciting, complex, immensely enjoyable novel,” Mr. Delaney called it in 2011 in The Economist. Don’t agree? Everyone can concur with his summation: “A book to get lost in.” To help frazzled readers find their way through the novel’s 260,000 words while making them less forbidding, Mr. Delaney, in the first episode of his podcast, invoked the “Peanuts” character Snoopy. He also wrote a rap tribute to Joyce. \n  Some conventional scholars were appalled, to which Mr. Delaney parried, “No one hates a popularizer more than an intellectual.” In his weekly line-by-line analyses, he sought to explain that while “every sentence in ‘Ulysses’ has more than one meaning and sometimes many meanings,” Joyce’s “multitasking in prose” could be contemplated simply. “In the ordinary is the extraordinary,” Mr. Delaney said of the book on his blog . “In the particular is the universal.” “Above all,” he told The Guardian in 2004, Joyce “taught every writer the importance of naturalistic dialogue; with his fine tenor voice Joyce knew better than most that we read not with the eye but with the ear.” In Mr. Delaney’s book “James Joyce’s Odyssey: A Guide to the Dublin of ‘Ulysses,’” he wrote that Joyce “believed that the key to human nature lay in observing the commonest acts of man, ordering a drink, eating a meal, opening an umbrella, folding a newspaper.” Reviewing the book in The Boston Globe in 1982, Robert Taylor described Mr. Delaney’s book as “a work of incisive criticism, written with style and grace and intelligence.” “Delaney avoids the temptation to treat Joyce as a petrified object, a monument,” Mr. Taylor wrote. “In fact, one of the most charming aspects of the volume is the interweaving of Delaney’s personal experience with Joyce’s novel — remarking the poignancy with which lives are touched by literature.” For example, Mr. Delaney wrote: “Once, in this part of Dublin, I trysted with a girl who, like me, had no timepiece, but we both lived in earshot, though in opposite directions, of the same church. So we left our separate residences when the bell began to ring. Thus, later, and through the entire day, the same bells ring in the ears of different characters in ‘Ulysses,’ the same processions are saluted in different parts of the city, the same persons are observed in different streets.” \n  Francis James Joseph Raphael Delaney (he rolled his eyes whenever he repeated his full name) was born on Oct. 24, 1942, in County Tipperary. His father, Edward, was the principal of the elementary school in Thomastown; his mother, the former Elizabeth Josephine O’Sullivan, was a kindergarten teacher there. Both helped found the Irish teachers’ union. Photo Mr. Delaney made the elusive novel “Ulysses” accessible to the average reader. Credit Frank Delaney Mr. Delaney is survived by his wife and frequent collaborator, Diane Meier, a marketing executive; their sons, Bryan and Owen; and three grandchildren. He was 8 when his godmother, a teacher, gave him a copy of “Treasure Island” with this advice: “As you read, think of the man who was making up this story. Where was he sitting, what kind of pen was he writing with?” He developed such an affinity for the author, Robert Louis Stevenson, that he later wrote a faithful sequel titled “Jim Hawkins and the Curse of Treasure Island.” “With his straggling mustache, his unstoppable curiosity and his heart of fire,” Mr. Delaney wrote of Stevenson, “he has always been one of the very few authors with whom I’d ever have wanted to hang out.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:29:57.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
