But as with any band that made its greatest impression in a previous era, Soundgarden draws from its yesteryear. The group's debut album, \"Ultramega OK,\" turns 30 next year. And last year Soundgarden celebrated the 25th anniversary of its breakthrough album \"Badmotorfinger\" with fancy reissues of the album.\nSoundgarden's allure wasn't difficult to dissect: Its draw was built on the operatic hard rock vocal histrionics of frontman Chris Cornell which soared above the Black Sabbath-influenced bedrock metal guitar playing of Kim Thayil.\nThe band's sway peaked in 1994 when sludgy hard rock from Seattle reached a point of cultural ubiquity. Its 1994 album \"Superunknown\" was a multi-million seller. But points of cultural ubiquity are often short lived. Soundgarden released another album in 1996 and then called it quits.\nCornell released a few solo albums that ranged from listenable to trainwreck. Thayil and bassist Ben Shepherd played a lot of odd job gigs and recordings with other folks. Drummer Matt Cameron enjoyed the good life in Pearl Jam.\nTickets for the show go on sale at 10 a.m. March 3rd, more information here .", "external_links":
