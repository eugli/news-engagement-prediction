Business First is honoring 21 women this year who are top leaders in the community. 21 photos Miquelita Carrion is quality systems professional and project management professional for… more These women come from a wide variety of industries and their roles are just as varied. They are CEOs, corporate executives, entrepreneurs, nonprofit leaders — and now, they are 2017's Women of Influence. View the accompanying slideshow to see all of the honorees and to learn in what industry they work. The selection process began with a call to the public for nominations of New Mexican women who are leaders, role models, mentors and innovators. From there, the nominees submitted applications and letters of recommendation. A panel of judges evaluated applicants on professional achievement, leadership and community involvement. More than 250 nominations were submitted by the public. Judges reviewed more than 120 applications to select the 21 Women of Influence. The judges were: NAIOP New Mexico President Lynne Andersen ; Native American Community Academy Executive Director Kara L. Bobroff ; Briones Business Law Attorney Thomas R. Briones ; Southwest Women's Law Center Executive Director Pamelya Herndon ; and Janice Torrez , divisional vice president, external affairs and chief of staff, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico. Judges recused themselves from voting on any nominee with whom they had close ties. This year, Albuquerque Business First has created a day-long Women’s Summit on April 3 that includes the Women of Influence awards, our annual Mentoring Monday event and executive leadership roundtables. Registration for the Women of Influence awards luncheon that day is here . The luncheon will be held at the Hyatt Regency Downtown.
