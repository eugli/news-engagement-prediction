But the couple stayed mum.\nMohsin has now opened up about his relationship with Shivangi.\nMohsin said in a statement: \"We have been linked to each other ever since we became part of the show but we chose to avoid all those rumours and not let it affect our friendship or work in anyway.\"\n\"In fact, there was nothing to talk about initially, since we were just friends. Our friendship graduated to love only recently. It's just been a month and a half. We rang in the New Year with my family. Funnily, we haven't gone out on an official date yet, owing to our erratic schedule.\"\nAsked what made him fall for Shivangi, he said: \"Shivangi's innocence made me fall for her. We are still exploring each other. It has been a long friendship and a beautiful journey, which has now blossomed into love.\"\nThe cast of the show will soon fly to Bikaner to begin the shooting of the wedding functions of Naira and Kartik.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:50:58.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
