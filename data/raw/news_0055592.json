Most of the emaciated animals had no food and green coloured fluid was there only water to drink. Source: Supplied A fly was found in the dogs infected ear canal. Source: Supplied All of the dogs were found with serious health issues. Source: Supplied \nTodd Baker received a three year good behaviour bond for each of the 15 counts of animal cruelty, to be served concurrently, and was fined for cost of the vet care of the animals when he faced Penrith Local Court today. \nHe was also banned from owning animals for the next 10 years. \nEvery single one of the dogs found alive had serious health problems because of the horrific conditions which they had been subjected to, at the property which used to be known as Herizon Kennels, which bred dogs for sale. Flies and insects were everywhere, attracted by the urine and faeces which covered the ground. Source: Supplied \nMost of the dogs were located locked in pens without shelter. The RSPCA said where there was drinking water available, it had turned green. \nThe dogs had severe medical conditions, including one a severely ulcerated scrotum, and another with a dead fly found imbedded in an infected ear, while others were found tethered without access to food or water. \nThe yard was completely filled with the dogs’ faeces and was ridden with flys and insects, when the scene was discovered by RSPCA inspectors. \nIn one pen, dried blood and a pool of bodily fluids smelt like a dead animal. RSPCA NSW found the smell of a dead animal in one of the pens. Source: Supplied \nThere was no covering on the hard concrete for the dogs on the property. \nAnother dog was found with burnt testicles, consistent with having burnt them on hot concrete. \nNumerous bodies of dogs were found in a freezer on the property, as well as half of a burned dog’s body which was in full view of other the other canines in the yard. RSPCA NSW inspectors found dogs with burnt testicles. Source: Supplied \nThe dogs had been diagnosed with dehydration requiring fluid therapy, covered in fleas, untreated wounds, ear infections, dental diseases, severe osteoarthritis, and emaciation. \nOther dogs had ulcerated paw pads. \nMr Baker alleged that the dead fly located in the ear canal of one of the dogs had been planted there by one of the RSPCA inspectors. The property had previously been used as a kennel. Source: Supplied RSPCA NSW inspectors attended the property in response to a complaint about the welfare of dogs. Source: Supplied \nMr Baker is said to have been hostile and aggressive and verbally abusive toward RSPCA staff. \n“The mind boggles how someone that has a history of breeding for profit could let so many dogs get in such horrendous conditions. Every single dog had serious health problems — some of them truly grotesque and heartbreaking,” RSPCA NSW Inspector James Arentz said. \nThe RSPCA has begun the process of rehoming the dogs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:44:59.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
