But after that, we won’t be seeing Cena for a while. \n“Cena will be hosting the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards on 3/11. After that, rumors are that he will team with girlfriend Nikki Bella to take on The Miz and Maryse at WrestleMania. Some sites are reporting Cena could be on hiatus until as late as next year’s Survivor Series. Cena recently apologized for his previous comments about The Rock being a part time star and not giving his all to the WWE Universe. Have we seen the last of John Cena as a full time WWE Superstar?” \nOnly @JohnCena , giving open challenge in @WWE , And they all match of 2015 is the Brilliant. He's very strong. #wweuniverse #NeverGiveUp pic.twitter.com/oIkq9qtls8 \n— CENA'$ BIGGEST F@N (@ImranKhan0600) February 19, 2017 \nIf, indeed, this is the end of the line for John Cena, he would have had a career that was well-earned, and well-deserved. It’s no wonder that, according to the latest WWE rumors from Sky Sports, Kurt Angle has recently said that Cena — while underappreciated now — will go down in history as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time. \nIn March, Angle will be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame , and it’s rumored that Cena will do the inducting. And while that may be part of the reason that Angle sang his praises, there’s another, more important reason that Angle said that Cena will be considered amongst the greatest of all time: because it’s true. \n“I’m not going to say he’s the greatest athlete in WWE history but he will go down as the greatest of all time in WWE history. He’s not a guy who’s going to throw fists and mix it up but what he has been able to endure for 12, 13 years, nobody has ever done that.” \n— Manager Sanjoanense (@TheManagerSJBV) February 15, 2017 \nWhat do you think of this latest round of WWE rumors about John Cena?
