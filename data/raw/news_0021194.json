I kicked the hornet’s nest, you just rubbed a hornet’s head. Both bad. It’s not the outcome I wanted, but it’s history. I got a man elected president, I want my points.” \nMeyers, who was on The Tonight Show to discuss the upcoming HRC Greater New York Gala, also reminisced about starring with Trump in a 2004 SNL sketch called “ Fathers and Sons ” alongside Fallon and Horatio Sanz. \n“Trump and I…he doesn’t love me,” Meyers said, referring to his Late Night coverage . “It was funny because in that sketch, me and Trump, even as father and son, we didn’t get along,” he added. \nIn addition to politics, Meyers and Fallon — who both work inside NBC’s famed home at 30 Rockefeller Plaza — also goofed around while filming local promos. \n“We didn’t talk about how close our studios are,” Fallon said. “But really, and you’ll be able to hear it soon ’cause the [ Late Night ] band starts playing up there and we can hear it.” \n“Oh really? Well, we can hear The Roots. If you can hear our band, do you think we can’t hear The Roots?” Meyers laughed. \nThis was before they even got to the promos. The hosts then joked about hearing lively music while chatting about a serious topic, as they shouted and danced to each other over the loud noise. \nWatch them pal around in the clip above.
