Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA few years prior to the birth of her son, Heather Miller, originally from Texas, came across a Facebook post from someone who had shared a photo of their stillborn child. \nIn her emotive account of her own loss, Heather openly admits her reaction to those photos was to think, \"how morbid\", before scrolling past them and putting them out of her mind. \nOf this reaction, over in an instant and seemingly insignificant at the time, Heather acknowledges, \"if only Iâ€™d known back then what I know now.\" \nFor on March 30 2016, prior to being induced for the delivery of her son, stillborn at 18 weeks, she was asked two questions. \n\"Would we like any photos of our child, and did we want to hold our child? \n\"Without hesitation or explanation, I immediately said, 'No.'\" \nIt was her husband, Christopher, who quietly and carefully said that not only he did want to hold their son, but he also wanted to have a record that he was here. \nSpeaking to Mirror Online, Heather shares how and why she came to not only hold her son, James Alvin Miller, but bravely chose to share the four pictures they have of him. \"We have four photos of our son. Just these four photos that we are comfortable sharing.\" The couple have four treasured photos of their son (Photo: Heather and Chris Smith) \nSix months into her marriage with the man she knew she'd marry from their first date, Heather discovered she was expecting their first child. \nBoth she and Christopher were overjoyed. \nHeather had enjoyed a happy and healthy pregnancy. \nIt was at her 18 week scan, however, that she was told the devastating news that no heartbeat could be detected. \nFrom this painful blow, things moved quickly. \n\"I went straight to the hospital and about 15 hours later on March 30th, I delivered our son stillborn, James Alvin Miller,\" Heather says. \n\"That's when we learned he had the cord around his neck. \n\"We named him after our grandfathers that both passed away just a few weeks and months before.\" \nWhile waiting to be induced, the couple were approached about holding James, and whether they wanted photos of him taken. \n\"The thought of holding my dead child and having photos of him scared me,\" Heather explains. \n\"I wasn't strong enough to see that. The logical side of me thought I would never look at the photos. They would be too morbid and painful, and I couldn't subject myself to that. \n\"The conclusions I came up with were strictly to protect myself and were made out of fear.\" Chris with his son (Photo: Heather and Chris Smith) \nHaving witnessed Heather's trepidation and Christopher's willingness to hold their son and have photos of him taken, a nurse offered the couple some words of advice. \n\"She explained that in all her years of working with stillbirth parents, not a single one regretted holding their child or receiving photos. \n\"The regrets came after, when parents had opted to not hold their child or have photos taken.\" \nFollowing a frank phone call with her aunt, and having seen what it would mean to her husband, Heather changed her mind. \n\"I knew I could never deny my husband a moment to hold his child or keep him from photographing his child.\" \nNow, her only regret is that she did not hold James for longer. \nOf that time she had with James, indelible in her memory, Heather says: \n\"My husband held our son first and wept. Once I was strong enough to sit up, my husband handed me our sweet baby, all 3.5 ounces and 8 inches of him. \n\"I cried and stared and stared and stared. I memorised his face. His nose and ears. His face and eyes, just like his daddy's. His fingers and toes. His tiny little knee caps and little belly.\" \n\"I wish I had held him longer. I wish I had more photos of him. I wish I had been looking at the camera. I wish my husband and I were together in a photo holding him. I wish I hadn't crumbled in panic when I went to give him a kiss and saw that his forehead was bleeding. James' heart stopped at 16 weeks (Photo: Heather and Chris Smith) \n\"My husband quickly took him from me, and I never kissed him. I never kissed my child. That pain feels like a 400-pound man sitting on my chest, and I'm afraid it may never leave. \n\"I know that to some, my son's photos are hard to look at. His heart stopped at 16 weeks and five days. He's not a round, chubby, eight pound baby. \n\"His neck and head were swollen from a wrapped umbilical cord. He was red, and his ears and nose were still developing. \n\"The photos were taken about four hours after I delivered him, so the surrounding environment had started to take its toll on his little body, hence the bleeding I saw.\" \nIn the days and weeks which followed the loss of their son, Heather and Chris we aware they may need to be careful with whom they shared this precious record of their son. \nThe couple elected to only show the images of James to those who asked. \nIt was a Twitter exchange with another mum who had suffered a similar loss which changed Heather's mind. \nBy and large, the response has been positive. \n\"We did receive some harsh comments and of course with each negative comment, I bawled. \n\"But we took the time to reach out to them and chat with them. All but one, apologised and thanked us for helping them understand why we shared our son's photos. Heather admits she held her son for longer (Photo: Heather and Chris Smith) \n\"One even blamed it on her anger toward Donald Trump and his stance on abortion.\" \nSince James' passing the couple have had to cope with another at loss at 10 weeks in October last year. \n\"Needless to say,\" Heather says, \"it was a really tough year for us. \n\"We are trusting the doctor and have began to try again this month. We are prepared for the reality this may happen again, so adoption is not off the table just yet.\" \nIn addition to their losses, Heather has also had to navigate the vast and painful range of emotions which have followed. \n\"Every time someone announces a pregnancy, I feel immediate jealousy and then fear for them. I am jealous for obvious reasons but so fearful that they will lose their baby. Read More \n\"You become very hyper-aware of pregnancies and babies around you. It's like my new superpower and it sucks. \n\"I am not angry for losing my child but for not being able to talk about it. \n\"It's like you spend weeks rehearsing a song for your friends and family. You are beyond excited and ready to perform. \n\"You walk onto the stage, ready to share your beautiful song and right before you belt out the first note, someone turns the lights off, the curtain drops and everyone leaves. \n\"That hurts and that hurt turns into anger. I feel that anger when someone says something like 'at least it was early or 'oh that happened to my cousin...pass the chips'. Ouch.\" \nOne positive which has emerged is the community which Heather has discovered of other women, people, having to live with their experience of infant loss as best they can. The couple have since gone through an additional loss (Photo: Heather and Chris Smith) \nThere have also been lessons and realisations. \n\"Somehow and in some way you will survive,\" Heather says. \n\"Join groups or networks that you can reach out to and share with. Don't let the fear of those not understanding stop you from wanting to celebrate your child, that's your right as a parent. \n\"I have learnt most people just don't know what to say and don't want to hurt you. But in reality it hurts more when someone doesn't say something. So that's where loss parents need to learn to say 'hey, I want to talk about my kid.'\" \n\"It's a long learning process but it does get easier. \n\"I can't tell you how amazing it is to hear your child's name brought up casually in a conversation.

It's okay that people don't understand, that means they have never gone through this. \n\"We won't find a cure for miscarriages or stillbirths, but we can create an environment where mom's and dad's that want to talk about it, can. \n\"With that said, I also honour and respect those parents that choose not to share, everyone is different. \n\"The more I speak my son's name, the longer he lives here on earth.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T16:09:36.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
