It sounds like a cross between a burp and a bit of a belly grunt,\" Ms Eccleston said. \n\"It sounds like a really sad orchestra that's failing.\" \nThe other females present will screech their disapproval of what they are witnessing. \n\"If there are other koalas around there's quite a lot of ruckus because they're all rejecting his advances,\" she said. Even koalas need a helping hand \nSometimes nature has a little bit of trouble taking its course and koalas need a helping hand. \nThe breeding program handlers have a box of custom-built equipment designed to aid the process. \nAmong them is a glass rod with small protuberances at one end, specially made to stimulate ovulation in the females. \n\"It was quite an interesting thing to have a glass blower produce for us,\" Ms Eccleston said. \n\"This is a tool that we can use to help the wild populations in the future as well, so really important stuff.\" \nAnother unusual hand-made device is used collect semen from the males. \nIt is a three-inch long tube of PVC pipe about an inch wide, with a valve at the top and a soft rubber interior. \n\"The first modification on this little design was a cricket bat handle, the rubber grip of a cricket bat handle,\" Ms Eccleston said. \n\"We fill it with water to a perfect temperature that you would find inside a female koala.\" \nA glass vial is used to collect the semen, which is then introduced through a specially designed catheter. \n\"The male doesn't realise that we've just gone and done … a bit of a switcheroo,\" she said. Echidnas getting right to the point \nEchidna mating is generally quite unusual — the males have a four-headed penis and several males will follow females in a train when she ready to breed. \nOne male echidna in particular at Currumbin has distinguished himself as the program's top breeder. \nHowever, in his constant enthusiasm to mate, he often injures himself on inanimate objects inside his enclosure. \n\"He has a particularly high sex-drive,\" Ms Eccleston said. \n\"He'll take any object that may be in his path to make it his own.\" \nHandlers have to provide him with some soft toys as a distraction to deter him from hurting himself on rocks, boxes and other males. \n\"At the moment his favourite thing in the whole world is a cockatoo hand puppet,\" she said. \n\"That gets put through the wash quite regularly.\" The short, rewarding life of the phascogale \nThe males in one particular native mammal species live to reproduce. \nThe brush-tailed phascogale is a relative of the Tasmanian devil. \nThe males try to breed as soon as they are old enough and once they mate, they die. \n\"They're here for a good time, not a long time,\" Ms Eccleston said. \n\"They end things on a good note. After a season of phascogales, at the end all you'll have left is pregnant females. All the males will have died.\" It takes cockatoos to tango \nAustralian wildlife mating is not all rough animal behaviour; some natives also display a range of gentler traits. \nThe vulnerable species the black glossy cockatoo pairs for life, which can be up to 80 years. \n\"During that time they will stay monogamous to one another,\" Ms Eccleston said. \n\"If a partner dies they will actually be quite mournful.\" The gentle smile of a crocodile Photo: Female saltwater crocodiles will gently carry their young in their sharp teeth. (ABC Gold Coast: Damien Larkins) \nWhile the Australian saltwater crocodile may look rough on the outside, unlike many other reptiles the females are incredibly gentle and attentive mothers. \nA female crocodile will guard her eggs in the mound until they hatch and then help them out of the nest. \n\"They'll really gently allow them to climb into their mouth and take them down to the water,\" Ms Eccleston said. \n\"Imagine that, climbing into a set of teeth like that. That's trust, that's love.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T09:00:40.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
