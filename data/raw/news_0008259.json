(Photo: LIVINGSTON DAILY FILE PHOTO) \nMichigan's Woody the Woodchuck agrees with Punxsutawney Phil: There will be six more weeks of winter. \nWoody, the Great Lakes State's official groundhog, made her annual prediction this morning at the Howell Conference and Nature Center, just minutes after Punxsutawney Phil made his prediction , by not coming out of her house. \nIf Woody doesn't come out of her house or runs back into her house within 30 seconds of coming out, the prediction is six more weeks of winter. If she stays out of her house for 30 seconds or longer, she predicts an early spring. Looks like 6 more weeks of winter! Woody wouldn't come out! @WLNS @HowellNatureCtr pic.twitter.com/4Q3it7StNS â€” Mariah Harrison (@WLNSMariah) February 2, 2017 \nOh well. We saw some sun to start February in downtown Detroit, at least. Maybe that'll be a sign for things to come this month? \nBe sure that you follow the Detroit Free Press on Twitter ( @freep ) and Instagram and like us on on Facebook .
