Get thee to the tipline and send us your suggestions. We'd love to see what you've got. Location: Palm Springs, California Price: $925,000 Though not quite as spectacular as the former home of Tippi Hedren , this midcentury cutie is nothing to thumb your nose at. Designed by William Krisel in 1968, the 2,312-square-foot home has everything youâ€™d want in a resort-town getaway: clean lines, flowing floor plan, large sliding glass doors, bright white interiors, and, of course, a private pool, all great for entertaining. Recently updated, the Kings Point residence also features three generously-sized bedrooms and baths, a dual living space divided by a double-sided fireplace, flexible dining area, and a gleaming kitchen with a wall of windows. Architecturally speaking, the property comprises a cantilevering flat roof, with that of the main living area elevated above the rest of the house and punctuated by clerestory windows, brick detailing, and crisp planes. Located at 2781 South Kings Road West, the property is set among community pools, tennis courts, and golf courses. If this speaks out to you in any way, it can be yours to the tune of $925,000.
