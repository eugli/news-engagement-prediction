Same-sex marriage became legal in 2014. \nThe couple's lawyer, Karon Monaghan, said Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan wanted \"to enter into a legally regulated relationship which does not carry with it patriarchal baggage, which many consider comes with the institution of marriage\". \nThe Government says it wants to see the impact of gay marriage on civil partnerships before deciding whether to extend them to everyone, abolish them or phase them out. \nThe three appeals judges agreed the situation was discriminatory, but two of the three said the Government should be given more time to decide on the future of civil partnerships. \nMs Steinfeld said that although the couple lost, \"all three judges agree that we are being treated differently because of our sexual orientation\". \nMr Keidan said they would appeal to the Supreme Court unless the Government agrees to change the law. \nAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:03:42.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
