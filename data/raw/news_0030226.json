Sprewell spent five years with the Knicks from 1998-2003, averaging 17.9 points per game during his tenure. He then signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves and poured on 51 points in his return at Madison Square Garden, dishing out an expletive-laced tirade at his former owner along the way. \"All I can tell you is that he doesn't belong in our stadium,\" the Knicks owner said after that game, according to the New York Daily News . Sprewell was one of many former Knicks players to be honored on Sunday, including Bernard King, Bill Bradley, Herb Williams , Larry Johnson, Vin Baker, John Wallace and Kenny Walker. Dolan sat in his court side seats next to Sprewell and King.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:25:49.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
