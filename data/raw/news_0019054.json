Benedict Brook and AAP news.com.au \nIF YOU think you’re sweltering through the heat, spare a thought for the good people of Adelaide where it was still above 40C at 7pm on Wednesday. \nWhile in outback towns, and even in Sydney where it will hit 39C on Saturday, we could be on the brink of a record breaking run of hot days. \nWith blackouts, bushfires and five of Australia’s capitals sweltering through highs north of 30C on Thursday, we may have just reached peak summer — or should that be peak suffer. \n“It’s hot and horrid and I heard someone even use the world sultry. It’s not nice, it’s no tropical holiday,” Tina Donaldson, a forecaster with the Bureau of Meteorology based in Adelaide, told news.com.au. \n“Yesterday we got to 42.4C in Adelaide and it wasn’t until midnight that we dropped down to below 30C so it’s been a hot night for most people. \n“It’s going to be a similar day today with a forecast max of 42C and it’s pretty much all set to continue on Friday as well.” \nThe culprit is a stubborn northerly wind sucking hot air down from Central Australia across the state. \n“Northern parts of South Australia have been in a heatwave for the last week. With Moomba going 13 days above 40 degrees they’re going to get close to breaking records,” she said. \nThe town in the north east of the state hit 46.6C on Wednesday. Today will be much the same. \nIt wasn’t just the heat causing misery, said Ms Donaldson. \n“It’s very humid so everyone notices that and that reduces people’s ability to recover from the heat”.

Around 125 hectares have been destroyed. \nDepartment of Fire and Emergency Services incident controller Brad Miles said conditions were difficult for crews, but they were confident of containing the blaze. \n“It’s quite hilly, some of it is forested country, some of it is granite-involved, so there’s a lot of challenges,” he told the ABC on Wednesday night. Heatwaves are in store for much of south and eastern Australia. Source: Supplied \nMELBOURNE \nMelbourne will top out at 37C on Thursday before a cool change this afternoon. Areas in the Wimmera and Mallee could reach up to 44C. \nEmergency Management Commissioner Craig Lapsley says with the heavy rain Victoria received earlier in the week, firefighters will be on alert to battle grass fires. \n“It’s a hot day and we’ve also got strong winds, so it’s bringing the fire danger up,” he told Melbourne radio station 3AW. \nHe’s advised tradespeople not to use grinders, welders and cutters because they could start a fire from the sparks. \nThe CFA is advising people to activate their bushfire plans and monitor the fire and weather situation. \nSYDNEY PREPARES FOR HEATWAVE \nJust two days after copping half a month’s worth of rain, Sydneysiders are set to be hit with another heatwave with a trio of days with highs above 35C. \nTemperatures are forecast to soar past 34C in parts of the city’s west on Thursday. By Friday, the mercury is tipped to rise to 35C in the city and 40C in the west with a sizzling weekend of 39C on Saturday and 38C on Sunday. \nThe Bureau’s David Martin said a string of such hot days was unexpected in the Harbour City and hadn't been seen since January 1994. \nIf temperatures beat expectations, and exceed 39C for four days, a record run of heat, set in January 1960, could fall, he told Fairfax .

The mercury in Birdsville is tipped to reach 45C on Thursday and Saturday, while a top of 46C is expected on Sunday. \nThe town’s February maximum temperature record is 46.2C, which was only set last Friday. \nThe forecast means the town could also break Queensland’s February daily maximum record of 46.5C. \nThe Bureau of Meteorology’s Andrew Bufalino said hot air building in the atmosphere since the New Year had pushed up temperatures in Birdsville and many other parts of the state. \n“We have had a stagnant weather pattern that has led to a significant pool of hot air over much of the interior of the country with no significant change of air mass,” he explained. \nHeat records could also tumble in southern Queensland on the weekend, with temperatures as high as 12C above average forecast. \nMr Bufalino said records were most likely to be broken in Toowoomba and Applethorpe. \nA top of 38C is forecast for Toowoomba on Sunday, 0.6C above its February temperature record.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:25:08.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
