He’s a hard worker, so he’s another player we’re hoping to address his contract and have him here for the long term.” There was no discussion of a time frame for addressing Brown’s deal. He has one year left on his deal, but the Steelers also have to deal with running back Le’Veon Bell ’s impending free agency in the near future.
