And none showed him speaking. This confirms the open secret that Buhari is 100% paralyzed on the left side of his body from his head down to toes. This is why there will NEVER be a VIDEO clip by his spin Journalists no matter how hard you try. Even BBC who helped Yar’Adua out last time by airing his purported broadcast has refused to air what Buhari’s men presented as Buhari’s broadcast. The drama/nightmare/comedy (depending on how you view the situation) continues Public Protector \n@disqus_acJeJPgn7X:disqus \nSince Buhari was reported to have found his voice the Naira began to fall and worsen in exchange rate value, and hitting the bottom today at 510 to one U.S dollar. The rate was by contrast stable when he was rumoured dead. Premium Times should pay due attention in deciding to publish or not to publish Buhari’s photo. Who knows how far the Naira will fall tomorrow since this eerie photo only suggests left hand amputation? Investigation Officer \nBUHARI IS HALE AND HEARTY AND VERY CHATTY, SAYS YEMI OSINBAJO \n• Why did Buhari’s right hand stop at the elbow in the first picture above? • Why is his left hand missing in the 2nd picture and rested as if placed on the chair in the first picture with no movement at all? • Did Muhamadu Buhari suffer a stroke; if yes, what function is affected? musa aliyu \nWhat if he’s dead? Don’t U have Osinbanjo as an acting, who can do all Buhari can do? A beg make una allow us hear wordi! Otile \nFulani hard liners have threatened to invade Igbo land and Niger Delta if Buhari dies. God save SE SS let Buhari hang in there even if he is coma until next election. Nobody deserves to die because of Buhari B. Me$$i \nBut people died when he lost elections. People also died ‘celebrating’ when he won elections. Now you claim people will die If he dies??? LORD HAVE MERCY! Otile \nLooking at the photo above it looks like Imam Mohamed suffered paralysis on his left hand. You know, paralysis is caused by nepotism, ethnic hatred, or oppression of the poor. Ikenna Okwuchi \nThe correct terminology would be tragi-comedy. ROTFLMAO Pete \nThere is no way I and many Nigerians will believe this story at all. With Tinubu appearing in the photo, then everything is wrong. The story just can’t be right. I suspect Buhari is long gone. Nothing associated with Tinubu can have truth in it. Malik Isah \nsounds like a death wish for yourself. remember Zik ? evidence \nThis is an old picture. Mamman Daura was in this picture. A close look will show that Mamman Daura has been cut off. taiwo \nLol. More like the ghost of Maman Daura…. Darlington \nWhy was Tinubu’s left hand almost affected by the cut? There is an element of truth in his assertion. Comfortkay \nIt is unbelieveable that some people without conscience are making empty noise about the health of our President. It is a pity that those with personal agenda will fail. Malik Isah \nand will die before him Comfortkay \nAmen Anonymous \nSo cus people wish Buhari dead, you too wish them dead on Buharis behalf when they did not wish you dead personally, which makes you just as guilty as them, they wished the president dead and you wish them dead, i hope u can see ur hypocrisy, you see a politician and pity him but you dont know how many during the course of his life that he has rendered widows, widowers, orphans, bereaved. All because of quest for power, how many people died cus of politicians who made hate speeches pitting northerners to move and kill? Jude owoh did not deserve to die by firing squad for drug related crimes which did not carry capital punishment, killing him by firing squad was a crime against humanity, a violation of human rights, but cus of sentiments u excuse the man who ordered for his extrajudicial killing. Go and meet Jude owohs kinsmen, go and ask Nkem Owoh if he understands and forgives the man who ordered the killing of his brother, whetehr millitary regime is enough excuse for Jude owoh or Ken saro wiwa to be killed in an extra judicial manner. I pray you are do not be in the shoes of those who have lost loved ones cus of quest for power by politicians before you find it so easy to judge, a human life is a human life, the life of the president is not of greater than value than those of the people of southern kaduna but he did not care to respond to their plight, his governemnt calls their gruesome deaths a fallacy, he did not show concern for them, go and judge them fro not showing concern for him. Me i dont wish another man dead and i have not killed anyone, can Buhari make same claim? Comfortkay \nThis write up is a complete nonesense AryLoyds \nThank God for Buhari ,Nigeria is not worth dying for. FreeNigeria \nTinubu standing outside in London cold in February without jacket, na today. Another Yar Adua saga is playing out. Tori Osa \nShut up. You chose to be blind. Can you see what Akande has around his neck??? By the way, this week has been a mixture of hot and cold Aso Irot \nLook at the pishure of Akande very well, it is Photoshop. Can’t you see? suleiman \nIs it so difficult for the president to dispel the rumors of his death on NTA London? Why do Nigerian politicians expose us to redicule all over the world. You only need to travel outside the shores of this country to know how everybody laughs at us. Yet our so-called leaders are so shameless to continue this charade. If the president is still alive, hale and hardy, at least he can address us in a three minute video. Let’s stop this nonsense and join the the comity of civilized nations. Okokondem \nThank you. emmanuel \nIf Buhari is not dead then let him appear on TV for 1 second…or CALL someone like Cardinal Okojie or Femi Kuti or people like these two whom Nigerians (Christians. Pagans, Muslims, Hari-krishna, free thinkers etc) will believe and not hardened liars like Liar Mohammed and subdued conformists like Osinbajo. Bamidele \nHave u noticed? No photograph ever shows Buhari from the left side. Never. This man is paralyzed. Stroke from brain damage. He shud resign and get out of the scene so Nigeria and Nigerians can move forward. After 74 years why should he still want to hold on tenaciously? Mosley \nThank you my brother. Some of us had relatives who suffered ailments and know the impact on their body. Can Buhari undertake a 12 hours flight from London to Lagos in his condition because Saraki said Buhari will return tomorrow, Saturday. These people should stop deceiving Nigerians. Otile \nIn February of what year did they take this photo of Buhari? paul irumundomon", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:10:42.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
