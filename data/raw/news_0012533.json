It is followed by Akwa State N150 billion, Rivers N134 billion, Delta State N126 billion and Kano State N111 billion. The five states cornered a quarter (25%) of the total allocation for the states and local government councils in Nigeria. \nAmong the 10 highest recipients from the Federation Account are Bayelsa State which got N99 billion; followed by Katsina State N83 billion, Oyo State N80 billion, Kaduna State N78 billion and Borno State N73 billion. \nThe lowest recipients are Gombe and Ebonyi States that got N46 billion each followed by Ekiti and Nasarawa States N47 billion each and Kwara N49 billion. \nThe report further disclosed that Edo and Ondo which are oil-producing states got N59 billion and N70 billion respectively while another state in the South-South, Cross River State merely received N55 billion. \nThe Economic Confidential gathered that factors that influence allocations to states and local government councils from the Federation Account include: Population, Derivation, Landmass, Terrain, Revenue Effort, School Enrolments, Health Facilities, Water Supply and Equality of the beneficiaries. \nMeanwhile, the Economic Confidential which has been publishing the monthly Federation Account Allocation figures in the print edition of the magazine since January 2007, has commenced the publication of the monthly allocation in its online version.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T16:18:49.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
