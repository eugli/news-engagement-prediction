Their injuries were sustained during a shootout that occurred when they escorted client Edwin Roberts on a hunting trip. \nInvestigators said Mr. Daughtery suspected that illegal immigrants were inside a recreational vehicle attempting to kidnap Mr. Roberts and his wife, but tried to enter the vehicle without announcing his presence, causing Mr. Roberts to shoot at the door, the Independent reported. \nMr. Daughtery retreated to his cabin to grab his gun and retrieve Mr. Bryant, and the two then begin firing at the RV. \nAuthorities said Mr. Daughtery shot Mr. Roberts, his client, in the arm and Mr. Bryant shot Mr. Daughtery, his colleague, in the chest, the Independent reported. \nThe newspaper noted that the local sheriff had been skeptical from the beginning about how the injuries were sustained, even as he admitted the area was known to be a hot spot for illegal border crossings. \nEven so, the initial claims of illegal immigrant violence seem to have benefited Mr. Daughtery financially. He was the subject of a crowdfunding page that generated $26,000 in donations for his medical care, according to page at GoFundMe.com that says the campaign is “complete and no longer active.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:05:03.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
