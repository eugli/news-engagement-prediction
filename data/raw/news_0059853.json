This is KTM's all new product and will be placed between the 200 Duke and new 390 Duke in India. KTM will manufacture the new 250 Duke from the Bajaj Auto's Chakan plant in Pune. \nThe deliveries of the 2017 KTM 250 Duke will commence from March. This is the first time that KTM is launching a product in the 250cc segment. \nEngine: \nThe new KTM 250 Duke will come with a 248.8cc single cylinder liquid cooled engine that produces maximum power output of 31 hp and maximum torque of 24NM, mated to a six-speed transmission and will comply with BS-IV emission norms. 2017 KTM 250 Duke \nDesign : \nThe new 250 Duke will be based on the design philosophy of the 2017 390 Duke, but might miss out on some premium features. These include LED headlamps and ride by wire system. However, the new 250 Duke will get ABS as standard and new LCD instrumentation console. \nFeatures: \nNow, not much is known of the India-spec Duke 250, but from the spy shots, the new 250 Duke will come with new MRF Revz-FC1 and Revz-C1 tyres, and the instrument cluster from the outgoing 200 Duke. 2017 KTM 250 Duke \nCompetition:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:46:02.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
