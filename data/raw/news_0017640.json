It has already built several mosques and plans construction of more places of worship in such cities as Dresden, Leipzig, Meissen, Riesa, Pirna, Bautzen und Goerlitz.

The Muslim Brotherhood “is trying to break into this vacuum and secure a monopolistic position,” he said, adding that the opportunity to spread the group’s influence came with the ongoing refugee and migrant influx from Muslim-majority countries. “Offering prayers is a religious duty for Muslims. And when there are no [other] mosques in the region, they go to those that exist there,” Meyer-Plath explained, adding that “it is needless to say that it is a bad situation when the only Muslim structures in the area are controlled by Islamists and political extremists.” The security official believes that the group has vast financial reserves as it does not lack money for sponsoring new construction projects or just buying real estate. “They are going through the land with a fantastic sum of money and are just buying real property” to turn it into mosques, Meyer-Plath said, adding that the local Muslims often appreciate their efforts.

The fact that the mosques are controlled by Islamists “does not mean that people who go there are necessarily being indoctrinated [into and becoming extremists],” the head of the regional BfV department said.The Muslims that attend such mosques “are often absolutely unaware” of the true nature of these facilities because the Salafist structures are quite “cautious about what they are saying,” Meyer-Plath said. He added, however, that believers often “start sympathizing [with the radicals] and become potential [recruits].” At the same time, Meyer-Plath stressed that the security services would continue to just monitor the activities of the Brotherhood in Saxony but would not take any active measures against them in line with German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere’s policy of “intense surveillance.” Meanwhile, an Islamic Cultural Center in Saxony’s capital of Dresden, which is allegedly controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood, denied all accusations of radicalism, saying that it supports “non-political Islam.” The center fully supports democratic values, its spokesman, Muhammed Wellenreuther, told German media. He also said that it welcomes both adherents of “conservative” and “progressive” forms of Islam. Wellenreuther confirmed that his organization looks for real property for sale, particularly in the rural areas of Saxony, in order to establish Islamic cultural centers and mosques there, as “there is a great demand” for them. BfV figures show that about 1,000 members of the Muslim Brotherhood are active in Germany, as reported by MDR. They particularly run Islamic centers that are used as venues for political and religious agitation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:43:58.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
