While this appears not to have been a terrorist attack, it does expose the city’s vulnerability in terms of public awareness of what people should do in similar threatening situations.\nIn countries where they have had the bitter experience of terrorist attacks and mass shootings, there has been a much greater effort at public awareness and education on what to do in dangerous situations than what we currently have in Hong Kong.\nFollowing a number of high-profile incidents in other countries, the citizens in those places have become more conscious of the need for better situational awareness and, more importantly, what to do when there is a risk of danger. In the UK, the public are advised to “run, hide, tell”, while in the United States they tend to prefer the “run, hide, fight” approach.\nMan arrested after firebomb attack on Hong Kong MTR train injures at least 18 \nEven in a place like Hong Kong, where the very professional emergency services are usually able to respond within minutes of an incident, as was seen in yesterday’s case, a lot of damage or injuries can be sustained before they arrive. It is therefore essential that the public have some sense of how better to protect or defend themselves in similar situations.\nOf course, it begins with better situational awareness, especially in crowded places with limited options for movement. According to eyewitnesses, the culprit in this case shouted his intentions a few times before throwing the petrol bomb. Clearly, it is no longer acceptable to accept odd or abnormal behaviour in public places and these people must be reported to the authorities immediately.\nAt the same time, it is essential that the authorities are more sensitive and responsive to such reports coming in so that they can provide, hopefully, earlier mobilisation of resources or intervention.\nSecond, the public needs to have in mind a suitable guideline or sense of what immediate action they should take. While the “run, hide, tell/fight” strategy has its proponents, it raises some concerns as running blindly might actually put you in more danger if you head for the wrong direction.\nThat is why I prefer the concept of “escape, evade, engage”. By using the word “escape”, you know you are meant to get away from the danger. Even if you do not know where that danger is, you will be constantly prepared to re-evaluate your escape route if it needs to be changed.\nTsim Sha Tsui MTR firebombing leaves commuters in fear as girl, 16, battles burns \nSometimes, as in Friday’s incident, where people were trapped inside an MTR train compartment, there is literally no way to escape. This leaves you with the option to “evade”, by attempting to move further away from the immediate danger, and maybe throwing items such as bags onto the ground to make it harder for the subject to follow or to hopefully halt the progress of any approaching flames.\nEvading might also mean adopting best practices in a fire situation, by crouching down to minimise the effects of smoke inhalation. In the early stages of the incident, smoke will rise to the roof of the compartment.\nLastly, it might be necessary to engage the subject, as waiting for the authorities to do so may be absolutely too late if lives are at stake. Engagement might mean attempting to subdue, incapacitate or delay the subject, buying precious extra time for others to either escape or evade the danger.\nIn this case, the suspect was a 60-year-old man, more than likely with only one petrol bomb, and it may have been possible to rush at him and envelop him with bulky clothing in order to pin him to the ground. After that is done, it might then be possible to address any danger from the flames or other dangerous items.\nSmoke and screaming fills carriages as firebomb on Hong Kong MTR causes commuter chaos \nIdeally, engaging the man before he was able to throw the petrol bomb might have helped prevent the incident in the first place.\nClearly, complacency in crowded public areas is no longer an option and everyone now needs to be looking out for possible threats and danger so that we can all help to protect one another.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:56:44.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
