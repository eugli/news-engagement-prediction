(Photo: Google Maps) 7 CONNECT 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThree African-American women are alleging they were the victims of racial discrimination at a sushi restaurant in Grosse Pointe Farms. \nTaNisha Prater and her friends, Adrienne Savage and Kimberly Hudson, said they went on a monthly “girls’ night out” gathering at Blufin Sushi on Saturday night. The women were sitting at the bar when an employee asked them to give up their seats for other customers who wanted to sit at the bar. \nPrater, owner of the Thrift on the Avenue store in Detroit's Midtown, said today that she and her friends looked around and realized “we were the only African American patrons at the time.” \nThey hadn’t finished their drinks, and the situation escalated after they paid the bill and asked to speak to an owner. \nRead more: Female sculptor sues GM: 'There's a sexist environment' \nThe woman who asked them to give up their seats turned out to be the general manager, Prater said. \n“We asked why did she ask for us to relinquish our seat?” Prater said, adding that the manager did not answer when asked why the three women were singled out. “I believe it’s because were African American,” Prater said she told the manager, who Prater said responded: “That’s it, I’m done talking with you,” and said she was calling the police. \nNeither the manager nor other representatives of Blufin could be reached for comment today. The phone line at the restaurant was busy for much of the day, and the manager did not respond to an emailed request for comment. \nPrater said she later asked other employees at Blufin for one of the manager’s business cards and began posting on Facebook Live about what was happening. She said the manager tried to snatch the card out of her hands and ushered her out of the restaurant. \nPrater and Savage, a communications manager for a health insurer, said the police arrived and asked for the women’s IDs, which they said they didn’t understand because they’d done nothing wrong. \nThe friends posted about their experience on social media to send a message against discriminatory treatment. \n“We love our community and neighbors,” Savage said. “We really want people to be aware and stand up for themselves.” \nPrater said she filed a police complaint against the manager alleging assault, and she and her friends want Grosse Pointe Farms police to explain why they were asked for their IDs during the altercation, a move that made them feel as if they were being targeted by the police during the incident when they’d done nothing wrong. \nOn the video, an officer tells Prater that the manager admitted to making a mistake, but Prater said the manager never said as much to the women and did not apologize. \nA dispatcher at Grosse Pointe Farms’ Public Safety department said no top administrators were available for comment because they were off for the Presidents Day holiday.
