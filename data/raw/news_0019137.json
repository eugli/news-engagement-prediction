It encourages the people traffickers.\" 'Britain can do better' \nFaced with a rebellion in the House of Lords, then prime minister David Cameron announced last year that he would accept the Dubs amendment and settle more child refugees. \nOn Wednesday, ministers announced that 200 children had been brought in under the scheme and that it would close after another 150 were settled in the UK. \nSpeaking in the Commons, Ms Cooper said thousands of child refugees were languishing in camps in Greece and Italy, desperate for help and at risk of abuse, exploitation and modern slavery. \n\"Britain can do better than this. Will she accept that and reinstate the Dubs programme now?\" Image copyright PA \nBut Ms Rudd said the UK was concentrating its efforts on providing aid and resettlement to vulnerable people in crisis-hit regions such as Syria. \nShe said: \"I completely reject her attack. The UK has a strong reputation in Europe and internationally for looking after the most vulnerable. That will continue. \n\"We have a different approach to where those most vulnerable are, we believe that they are in the region. \n\"That's why we have made a pledge to accept 3,000 children from the region and we are committed to delivering on that.\" \nResponding in the House of Lords, Lord Dubs said: \"It wasn't long ago that I remember that the prime minister when she was home secretary told me the government was prepared to accept the amendment. \n\"It was on the same day that the then immigration minister said to me that the government would accept the letter and the spirit of that amendment. \n\"I believe in arbitrarily closing down the scheme, without any good reason for doing so, the government is in breach of its own commitments.\" \nA legal challenge on how the government has handled the legal commitment will go ahead on Friday.
