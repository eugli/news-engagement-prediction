Granny’s house is your second home \nYou are just as comfortable here are you are in your own home, no matter what your age is. You can enter without knocking, help yourself to tea and have your own space on the sofa. You just have to make sure you take your shoes off at the door. 2. She always has sweet treats (Picture: Getty) \nA sweetie bowl on the table, a packet of toffees in the car and a kitchen cupboard full of cake-like delights, Granny knows we all have a sweet tooth and won’t judge us for it. And she always knows that you can manage a bigger slice of Battenburg than anyone else. 3. Her meals are to die for (Picture: Getty) \nHome cooked food is at its peak when your nan makes it. With my granny, her unbeaten and unreplicated dish is a mean shepherd’s pie (secret ingredient – actually no, I’d better not). With yours, it could be any manner of comforting, stodgy meals that you have enjoyed since childhood. No-one does it quite the same. 4. She gives the best hugs \nThey take every problem away. 5. She keeps your secrets \nGrandma is always team you. If you need to talk about something sensitive or something you don’t want to go any further, she is your gal. Nothing will leave that room if you don’t want it to. 6. And she is an amazing listener (Picture: Getty) \nMum and dad will jump in with advice or criticisms, friends will try to show you the bright side and bae will just worry – but Granny will hear you out, nod when needed and you will have her undivided attention. You won’t feel like you’re bothering her or being silly, she cares no matter what the problem. 7. She then gives the best guidance \nGranny has lived a life full of experiences – very little you can tell her will surprise her or leave her unable to advise you on. If you take any advice to heart in this world, make sure it’s your gran’s. She knows, okay? She knows. 8. She doesn’t judge you \nYou might have made a mistake, you might be a bit of a rogue or you might have even done something that not even you yourself can defend. And yet Granny will always see the good in you, she is your biggest fan. She might scold you for this behaviour – but disown you? NEVER. 9. Her house is always cosy \nAnother bar on the fire? Oh, go on then. 10. She’s generous (Picture: Getty) \nYou will never leave empty handed. Granny must have a grandchild budget – and you always seem to reap the rewards. Even though she knows she doesn’t have to, she just loves to spoil you. 11. She doesn’t sugar coat life truths \nOver the years, your nan has learned that there is no use beating around the bush. Therefore, if she wants to say something, she will say it. She doesn’t have time to mollycoddle or dance around the truth – if you need her to set you straight, she will do it properly. And then give you a cuddle and a Werther’s Original. 12. She has the best sense of humour \nAge means absolutely nothing when it comes to having a laugh – and my Granny is the funniest of the lot. When nan drops one of her jokes that silences a dinner table before an inevitable explosion of shocked laughter, you can’t help letting your chest swell with pride. 13. She doesn’t dismiss your knowledge \nYour Granny has a lot of life experience and probably knows far more than you – and yet she will always understand and embrace the fact that you can teach her too. She will ask you for internet lessons or help sending an e-mail – and then she will probably surpass you and be a web genius in no time. 14. Chilling with nan is the best \nLots of snacks, a warm house, her spoiled cat curled up between you and an episode of The Chase on the box? This is a true night in and those who have their grans appreciate them. Those who don’t miss them in a huge, aching way. 15. She always teaches you something \n\nWhether it’s a historical fact, what old money used to look like or what your dad was like as a baby, your gran never fails to fill your head with new information. 16. She’s always glad to see you \nLife is always busy but no-one’s face will light up at your arrival quite like your gran’s. If you turn up, she will cancel plans, whack a whopping great casserole into the oven and give you 100% of her focus. In a world where everything has become a stressful race, than can be no better feeling. 17. She makes you a better person \nYour one target in life is to be half the person that your Granny is. If she manages to guide you towards achieving that, then you know you have nothing to worry about. Your inspiration, Gran will always be your best friend, whether she is still with you or not. \nAnd by replicating her warmth and behaviour, others can enjoy a fraction of what you have been lucky to.
