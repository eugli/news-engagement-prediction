The income would help sustain the poor and sick and provide a cushion for those displaced in the high-tech economy, he said, such as truck drivers who may lose their jobs due to the advent of autonomous big-rigs. \nIstvan, a writer, said he made a small fortune fixing up and selling homes in California and Oregon. His wife is a doctor, and the couple has two young daughters. \nDuring his run for president, Istvan, 43, campaigned on a platform that advocated for advances in science, health and technology to extend human lifespan and intellect. \nTo draw attention to his cause, Istvan fashioned his campaign's “immortality bus” into the shape of a wooden coffin. \nIt worked. His campaign drew a fair amount of coverage for an independent candidate, and earlier this month he was featured in a New York Times Magazine story .
