That's all I'm doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 electoral college votes. I wasn't supposed to get 222. They said there's no way to get 222, 230's impossible,” said Trump.\n“270 which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before so that's the way it goes.\n“I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media's trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they're not happy about it for whatever reason.”\nMy exchange with President Trump: \"Why should Americans trust you?\" https://t.co/To3RUj00tz \n— Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) February 16, 2017 Watch this.

I was given that. We had a very big margin.”\nAsked why Americans should trust him, he responded: “Actually, I've seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that?”\nT rump has previously sparked a host of memes over his unusual handshakes and executive order signings . \nHere's how cartoonists around the world have reacted to Trump's first month in charge . \n*record scratch* \n*freeze frame* \nTRUDEAU: yup, that's me, you'e pro- \nTRUMP: personally I dont feel they're that small #TrudeauMeetsTrump pic.twitter.com/jXOFm5Jbiz \n— Andy Cole (@AndyCole84) February 13, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T13:44:55.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
