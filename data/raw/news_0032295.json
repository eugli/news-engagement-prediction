She didn't have the chance to do it until she'd been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, so she'd sing in hotel rooms while she did chemotherapy and radiation,\" Rory Feek said at Sunday's awards ceremony. \nWhen the album was nominated he said his wife made him promise he'd attend the pre-telecast awards ceremony. He says she added with a big smile, \"'Remember, if we win, I'll know before you will.'\" \nRory Feek told Fox News before the awards it \"doesn't mean anything to me if we win or we don't.\" \n\"Of course it's exciting and amazing to win but just to have my wife's name and our music still in the mix...is a good thing.\" \nHe added that the night will be about \"celebrating my bride.\" \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
