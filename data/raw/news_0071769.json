Burned for personal and home blessings. Burned or smudged for purification purposes. Incorporated into sweat lodge ceremonies. Carried as a protective totem. Kept in the home to attract positive energies. Suggested Ways to Use Sweet Grass for Healingfrom our readers \nI use it to clear out bad vibes. Or if I am worried about loved ones. Some of my relatives lay one across the dashboard of the car (safe travels) My dad says a prayer in his language (Shoshone). ~ \nOne Brother to Another Brother! - With sage, copal, and tobacco make a sun tea. To make place one gallon of water in 3 days of sunshine. Put it on your roof those 3 days. Put it in a 5 gallon container and add 3 more gallons of pure water. Use those 4 gallons of prepared \"tea\" for use in sweat lodge to pour over hot volcanic rock! Makes a good sweat! ~Range Hawk \nInvite Wanted Energy - Smudging is a two step process for me. It is removing unwanted energy and bringing wanted energy. Call them good vs bad if you will. I use sage to remove and sweetgrass to invite. I leave at least one window partway open during winter but in summer all windows would be open as well as doors. My belief is if the energy I wish to leave does not have a window or door to go out of it could make one and how can the energy I wish to come visit get in if there is something blocking the entrance. So I open a window or door depending upon time of year and I use the sage to clear room of those energies I do not want there. Then I use the sweetgrass to invite those energies I do. I also allow time for them to depart between using sage and sweetgrass and time for them to arrive before I close up house. ~Whitehorse Woman Also Read About Smudging", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:28:47.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
