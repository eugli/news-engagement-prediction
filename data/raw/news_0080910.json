Acceptable IDs included driver's licenses, handgun licenses issued by the state's Department of Public Safety, election ID certificates or personal ID cards issued by DPS, military IDs, citizenship certificates or passports.\nThe law’s most fervent supporters, including Gov. Greg Abbott, have long argued that the voter ID requirements were necessary for preventing voter fraud. But the law’s opponents point to studies that show Hispanic and black voters are disproportionately less likely to have one of the seven forms of ID that the law was written to accept.\nRep. Marc Veasey, D-Fort Worth, called the law “the clearest manifestation of modern-day voter suppression tactics” and challenged the law in court, along with several other voting rights organizations. The Obama administration also opposed the law.\nLast summer, judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the law was discriminatory but said they could not come to a conclusion on whether the Legislature had intentionally discriminated when writing the law. They sent the question of discriminatory intent back to U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos in Corpus Christi.\nRamos is set to hear arguments on the question of discriminatory intent Tuesday morning.\nAlthough the Department of Justice, now led by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, has yet to issue a formal court filing about its change in position, this is not the only change the administration has made on the voter ID argument.\nLast year, Texas officials asked the court to delay hearings on how the voter ID law could be fixed, arguing that the issue might be addressed during Texas’ current legislative session. The Obama administration opposed the delay, arguing that there was no firm guarantee a legislative fix was forthcoming.\nEarlier this month, when Texas officials again asked whether the court would postpone its efforts to address the aspects of the voter ID law that had been deemed unconstitutional, the Trump administration agreed that the case should be postponed.\n“Legislatures should have the first chance to address issues under the Voting Rights Act whenever possible,” officials wrote in a brief filed on behalf of Texas officials and the U.S. government. “It is thus appropriate for this Court to [postpone] the hearing until the Texas legislature has had an opportunity to act.”\nRamos denied the request to delay proceedings.\nOn Monday, Lang said the plaintiffs in the case will continue to fight, even though they’ve lost the support of the federal government.\n“Private plaintiffs will continue to pursue justice in this matter,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:43:26.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
