So when her baby girl popped out, it was a complete surprise. \n\"She just basically went ‘Ow’ and I kind of saw something but I wasn't sure what,” said Crystal’s mother, Tina Beaumont–Delong. “It was just unbelievable. You just don’t have time to think.” \nA dispatcher helped Tina and Crystal through the process, explaining what to do over the phone until the paramedics showed up. \nWaterloo Region paramedics arrived within minutes, and according to the family, were amazingly calm throughout. \n“That was the best call I’ve ever been on,” said Rochelle Moreira, one of the paramedics that came to assist. “I was very happy to be there for the beginning of life.” \n“We see a lot of negative in this job. We go to a lot of calls where it’s a lot of people’s worst day and you know, that day was their best day and we are so glad to be there for them and provide some good comfort and make sure that everyone was healthy in that situation,” said Cody Schwende, the other paramedic on duty that night. \nThe delivery went smoothly and both Crystal and baby Miranda are doing well. Miranda is a healthy eight pounds. \n“She’s my miracle,” said Crystal. \nWith files from CTV Kitchener’s Leena Latafat Photos The family, along with the new addition of baby Miranda, is doing well and want to acknowledge the team of people involved in helping that night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:24:17.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
