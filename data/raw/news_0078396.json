We can be better and not doing it feels really disappointing. \n\"Thank God we don't have to play again tomorrow. Now we have to react again.\" \nLeicester found themselves three goals up on the hour mark after a Jamie Vardy double and a Danny Drinkwater volley. \nPhilippe Coutinho's strike only proved to be a consolation.

Liverpool fans go into meltdown after defeat to Leicester \n\"A bad start, bad in the middle and bad at the end,\" Klopp reflected. \n\"We had a few better than average moments but most of the game was not even average. It was clear what would happen tonight, it was an emotional night but we have to show what we are fighting for. \n\"We knew how Leicester would play, go back to their roots. We could have done much better. We let them be Leicester of last year - that's our fault. \n\"We should get criticised. This inconsistency makes absolutely no sense.

We have to try with everything we have to do better. \n\"If you are not good enough you lose football games. I have no reason for this at the moment. You can always find excuses but I'm not ready to look for one. \n\"We had opportunities to do more throughout the game - we changed system at half-time but the crosses into the box were not good enough. We could have scored a second goal and that may have changed the game.\" poll loading Should Liverpool sack Jurgen Klopp? 500+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:28:15.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
