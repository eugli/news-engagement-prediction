They argue that doing so undermines the trust built between immigrant communities and local law enforcement. \nA letter from Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, City Attorney Mike Feuer and City Council President Herb Wesson requested that ICE cease calling themselves police when interacting with the public to prevent alienating undocumented immigrants from the LAPD.

A statement from an ICE spokeswoman refused to comment on the semantic controversy, arguing only that their tactics “ are consistent with their authorities under federal law and in accordance with the Constitution. ” 'Expedited removal' of illegals: Trump's newest immigration rules outlined https://t.co/p97Pfl8E4a — RT America (@RT_America) February 22, 2017 \nShe also explained that agents “ initially identify themselves as ‘police’ during an encounter because it is the universally recognized term for law enforcement and our personnel routinely interact with individuals from around the world ” and referred to it as a “ life-or-death issue. ” \nCity Attorney Feuer explained to the Times that it is not about the legality of the practice, but rather the long-term effects that are the real issue. \n“ At this point, this is a request grounded on the public safety implications of misrepresentation as police, ” Feuer said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:11:35.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
