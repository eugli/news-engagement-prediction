Pendulums are objects attached at the end of a string or metal chain. When suspended from a stationary position the pendulum will swing back and forth or in a circular motion. \nPendulums are made from a variety of materials including crystals, wood, glass, and metals. There is a general consensus within the healing community that using a wooden pendulum on a thread is the preferred option for receiving the most clarity. This is because both crystals, gemstones, and metals tend to absorb energies and these energies could cloud or influence information. If you are using a crystal pendulum choose a method of cleansing or clearing your crystal prior to your divination session, be it for healing or dowsing for answers. \nHolistic healers will use a pendulum for measuring energy fields or as a dowsing tool for divination purposes. Choose A Pendulum: Allow a pendulum to choose you. If you like the way it looks or feels, it is meant for you. Cleanse Your Pendulum: You may cleanse it by holding it under running cold tap water, soaking it in sea salt, or setting a mental intention to free it of 'picked up energies.' Understand the Directional Swings of Your Pendulum: Pendulums swing in vertical straight lines, horizontal straight lines, and in circular movements. Define the Directional Swings of Your Pendulum: Assign each directional swing a \"response\" by first asking the pendulum to show you what certain responses look like. Ask: What does a NO look like? What does a YES look like?... and so on.
