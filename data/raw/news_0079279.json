The firm has become a fixture on the high street since it started life in 1997. But its reputation has been hit by revelations about its tax affairs and its complex corporate structure. Labour MP John Mann said Caffe Nero was taking money from people paying tax properly and ripping off the taxpayer The head offices of Caffe Nero and Rome Pikco are based in Covent Garden in the heart of London. But Rome Pikco’s holding company, called Rome Holdco Sarl, is based in Luxembourg, a well-known tax haven. The ultimate parent company – called Saratoga – is based in the Isle of Man, another tax haven. The architect of this arrangement is Caffe Nero’s Californian founder, Gerry Ford. The 59-year-old, who lives in Kensington, west London, has previously insisted the structure ‘has no implications for our corporate tax at all’. This was given short shrift by MPs last night. John Mann, a Labour MP and member of the Treasury Committee, said: ‘Caffe Nero is taking business from decent people running cafes who are paying their tax properly. This is just ripping off the taxpayer. HMRC needs to gets it act together. It’s just a farce.’ Charlie Elphicke, a Tory member of the Public Accounts Committee which has been investigating tax avoidance, said: ‘It is unacceptable that large companies take money from British customers and do not contribute to the cost of public services.’ There is no suggestion that Caffe Nero has done anything illegal. A spokesman from Caffe Nero said: ‘Overall the group of companies that includes Caffe Nero did not make a taxable profit in the year to May 31, 2016. This is because of interest payments that it makes to third party UK-based banks.’ HMRC said it brought in a record £26billion in extra tax for public services in 2015, with £7.3billion coming from the 2,100 largest and most complex companies in the UK. A spokesman said: ‘Large businesses must pay the tax that is due. Everyone must play by the same rules.’ DISCOUNT FIRM'S TAX SECRET B&M Bargains has paid £152.6 million in dividends to a Luxembourg-based holding company over the past three years Britain's fastest-growing discount chain is a serial user of tax havens, it has been revealed. B&M Bargains has paid £152.6million in dividends to a holding company in low-tax Luxembourg over the past three years. And the firm’s chairman, Sir Terry Leahy, holds his stake through a US fund registered in the Cayman Islands. After the huge payment, the holding company paid £148million to shareholders in just one year. Some of the cash went to Luxembourg-based SSA Investments, which holds almost 21 per cent of B&M’s shares. SSA is owned by B&M’s owners Simon and Bobby Arora. A spokesman said B&M was based in Luxembourg because of its pan-European operations.
