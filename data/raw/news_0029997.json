Fire Service \nWhat was left of the Collingwood St villa. \nWhen fire broke out around 5am the three young people were unable to escape the smoke and heat of the blaze. \nPolice referred the deaths to the coroner after exploring all lines of enquiry that found no criminal culpability. BRUCE MERCER/FAIRFAX NZ \nEmergency services at the scene. \nAt the first day of the inquest before Coroner Gordon Matenga in Hamilton on Monday, the court heard how the fire started on a couch in the downstairs lounge. \nOn Tuesday, fire investigator Peter Hallett said fire investigations determined the point of origin was in the downstairs lounge area, given the significant amount of damage. \nExaminations showed extensive damage in the south western corner of the lounge, although exactly where the fire ignited could not be determined. \n\"The area of interest was the bar area and couch on the southern wall.\" Ad Feedback \nTesting by ESR revealed no trace of any flammable liquid, although there could have been a number of factors for this, he said. \n\"The fire service focused on the single window, a curtain on the window, which dropped down during the fire, during the course we found glass debris remains between the metre board and the couch. \n\"I couldn't rule out that the fire had been intentionally started by someone leaning through the window and it spreading to the curtains and boxes and sofa. \n\"But the fire pattern analysis shows that the floor for bedroom four has dropped down into the lounge on a diagonal pointing to where the couch was, the hallway above was completely destroyed. \n\"That area directly above couch is the most significant of area of burning, there were only a few pieces of couch and it had burnt the wall behind. \n\"If it wasn't the couch it was something very close to it.\" \nAlthough fire examinations could not determine the exact cause of the blaze, Hallet said there were two possible ways the fire started. \nFirstly, that the fire was ignited by a discarded cigarette butt that landed on combustible material and ignited from there. \nAnd secondly, the fire was deliberately lit. \nWhen asked by Toni's father, Mark Johnston, how long it would take a tailor made cigarette butt to ignite materials, Hallett said a smouldering cigarette could only ignite in perfect circumstances. \nIt needed to land on the materials at a perfect angle, with the right airflow and fuel to ignite, he said \n\"Evidence suggests anything from 11 to 22 minutes for a smouldering cigarette to start a fire.\" \nTwo multi-plugs discovered behind the bar area were discounted by an electrical engineer. \nThe only positive outcome from the tragedy was that it was the catalyst for the introduction of new laws to make smoke alarms compulsory in rental properties. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:59:21.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
