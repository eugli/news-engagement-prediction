It will operate as an online store.\nAdvertisement\nWhile online competition was a factor, rapidly rising rents in the square were the landmark shop’s undoing, said Madeleine Flanagan, executive director.\n“We’re in the 21st century; things are changing, and Old Harvard Square is changing, as well. How do you want us to stay the way we are? We can’t,” Flanagan said. “The rents went too high. We negotiated [a new lease] and we didn’t [get] what we wanted. I came to the decision slowly and really reluctantly.”\nThe shop, owned by Illinois-based MEP Inc., has rented space on Mount Auburn Street from the Spee Club, one of Harvard’s final clubs. Attempts to reach the club for comment were unsuccessful.\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Daniel Eastman, Schoenhof’s director of marketing and sales, said the Spee Club “has been really kind with us. This should’ve happened three years ago, but they tried really hard to find some way to help us stay.”\nThe self-proclaimed oldest and largest foreign-language-only bookstore in the United States was founded in Boston in 1856 but moved in 1983. The store, which has five employees, is expected to close March 25. The move was first reported by the Harvard Crimson.\nAdvertisement\nFlanagan said she would consider relocating in Harvard Square, but rising rents make that impossible at the moment.\n“Find me a place that’s affordable,” she said. “It’s a new mood in Harvard Square. We love this place so much — this kind of shop that we have, it has a place here, that’s for sure. That’s why we don’t want to go elsewhere.”\nSchoenhof’s is the latest Harvard Square stalwart bumped out by rising lease rates as a development boom washes over the area. Proposed developments are also threatening to push out the Out of Town News and Crimson Corner newsstands, as well as The World’s Only Curious George Store .\nThe square, once promoted to tourists as having a large concentration of bookstores, has seen the number decline steadily over the past decade: WordsWorth Books closed in 2004, followed by The Globe Corner Bookstore (in 2011), and Revolution Books (in 2016 ).\nSchoenhof’s plans to vacate its approximately 2,500-square-foot space, but it will continue to live as an online-only operation at www.schoenhofs.com , Flanagan said.\n“This is Chapter Two,” she said.\nDenise Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said the group is saddened by the loss of Schoenhof’s, stressing that the convenience of online shopping is the death knell for many small, independent businesses, many of which dot the square.\nDavid L Ryan/Globe Staff\nMadeleine Flanagan is the executive director of Schoehhof’s, which closes next month.\n“We will miss the experience of walking into the store, smelling that book smell you can only get at Schoenhof’s, and hearing the variety of languages being spoken in hushed voices. And you can’t get that from Amazon,” Jillson said.\nAmazon.com is opening brick- and-mortar stores, including in Dedham and Lynnfield, but whether they will have longevity is yet to be determined, said Alicia Borinsky, a professor of Latin American and comparative literature at Boston University and a longtime Schoenhof’s customer.\n“I hope they will be able to provide readers with intellectual excitement,” Borinsky said. “I hope independent bookstores are not going to go away, but we have fewer of them. Schoenhof’s is going to leave a very, very big hole in our community.”\nGail Gilliland, a writer of short stories from Natick, said she has been a customer of Schoenhof’s since the 1970s, when, as a junior at the University of California Berkeley, her French professor looked at her pitifully thin French-English dictionary and told her that if she was serious about studying the language, she needed a proper dictionary — from Schoenhof’s.\nThe store has been helpful throughout her career, including when she needed a pictorial dictionary to translate into English three chapters of an Italian romance novel written by a family friend.\n“The uniqueness of a place where those titles are in an original or foreign language, I can’t think of another place like that,” Gilliland said.\n“I would just browse . . . and pull a book out. You can’t do that online, pull a book out. You cannot do that without being in a physical place.”\nDavid L Ryan/Globe Staff\nPascale Torracinta, a French teacher, has been a regular Schoehhof’s customer for many years. The Harvard Square store plans to close its doors March 25.\nKatheleen Conti can be reached at kconti@globe.com .
