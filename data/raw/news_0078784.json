Philip Ramey Photography, LLC via Getty Images What? \nToday in totally random: Penn Badgley aka Dan Humphrey aka Lonely Boy aka Gossip Girl is officially off the market, so any chance of your future romance will live on in that embarrassing fan fiction you wrote back in high school. \nThe actor and Domino Kirke wed in a Brooklyn courthouse on Monday, surrounded by friends and family. Domino is sister to “Girls” star Jemima Kirke, who also joined in on the celebration. Thanks to guests’ sweet social media posts, we have a clue what the gathering looked like, and it’s already giving us major Jessa’s-ill-fated-wedding-to-Thomas-John in Season 2 of “Girls” vibes. Hopefully, this union has some more staying power.

We love you.” A post shared by Lola Kirke (@lolakirke) on Feb 27, 2017 at 8:37am PST \nBadgley and Kirke have apparently been dating since 2014, following the former’s highly publicized relationships with “Gossip Girl” co-star Blake Lively and actress Zoë Kravitz. \nCongratulations to the newlyweds!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:59:45.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
