Panneerselvam. \nP R Sundaram was one of four MLAs who managed to win the Assembly elections in 1996. Even Jayalalithaa was defeated in that elections. \nBesides this, the Dravidar Kazhagam leader K Veeramani questioned the Governor's delay in initiating the formation of a new Government when he had already accepted the resignation of Chief Minister O Panneerselvam. \nMr. Veeramani said “Panneerselvam is saying ‘good things will happen’ while the Sasikala camp says they have majority.” He further added “administration is in a limbo and Mr. Panneerselvam has said he was coerced.” \nThe Dravidar Kazhagam leader said “According to constitution there is no provision to take back resignation once it is accepted.” He said “Governor can separately investigate OPS claims of duress” and added “He has to invite whoever has the majority. Why is he delaying.” He further said “RSS and BJP wants to bring in Article 356. They are involved in destabilizing this government”. \nMr. Veeramani said “There is a need to put an end to this impasse. It is bringing a bad name to the Governor’s office. He further stated “SC is independent. In our country, legislature and judiciary are separate entities. \n“There is no date fixed for judgement. Whenever it comes and whatever it is, you face it at that time.” \nMr. Veeramani said \"Even Anna was not an MLA when he took oath.\" He further reiterated \"BJP is making efforts to saffronise Tamil Nadu.\" Mr. Veeramani said \"We are not bothered if it's Sasikala or OPS. We are worried only about the state.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:08:31.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
