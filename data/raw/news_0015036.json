Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nSinger Linda Nolan claims she is now looking younger than her Celebrity Big Brother-winning sister Coleen - after undergoing a £6,000 facelift. \nLinda, 57, admits she considered suicide because she looked tired and haunted after ten years of mourning her husband, and beating breast cancer only for it to take her sister Bernie in 2013. \nAnd after undergoing the surgery, Linda says she feels like a new woman - and even looks younger than 51-year-old sister Coleen. \n“I’m really happy with the results. It’s exactly what I wanted,” smiles Linda, who chose a lower facelift and extreme skin peel on the advice of her surgeon. Linda Nolan before the surgery (Photo: Urban PR) Read More Oops! Celebrity Big Brother committed a huge gaffe when Coleen Nolan left the house \n“It’s amazing to wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and feel better about yourself. And when I meet people I haven’t seen for a while, they’re amazed. The facelift has enhanced my life. The sadness has gone.” \nBut one person who hasn’t seen Linda’s facelift yet is Coleen, who won Celebrity Big Brother on Friday. \n“I screamed the house down as Coleen won,” said Linda. \n“She would never in a million years have believed she could have won. She looked so shocked.” (Photo: ITV) Read More \"I need him in my life\" Coleen Nolan reveals she missed husband Ray Fensome while in Celebrity Big Brother \nBut Linda laughs that Coleen is about to have a bigger surprise when she sees her sister’s face. \nLinda reveals: “I spoke to her ­afterwards and she asked me what I’d been up to. I felt so guilty because I didn’t say I was speaking to her with a new face! \n“I know she’ll go mad as she’s so anti-surgery. But she’ll only find out when she sees this.” \nLinda reckons she could now ­challenge Coleen for youthful looks. She laughed: “I think I look younger than her now so maybe she’ll be asking for the clinic’s number! I looked years older than my age with all the grief. I was aged well beyond my years. People say I know look 20 years younger after my facelift.

And her sadness only deepened every time it was reflected in the mirror. \nBut now, four weeks after surgery at London’s Harley Street Skin Clinic, all she can see is positivity shining back.
