A formal announcement will likely come Thursday morning when Viacom unveils its turnaround plan during its quarterly earnings call. \nSources tell THR that Spike chief Kevin Kay — who recently added oversight of CMT and TV Land to his purview of the Global Entertainment Group — is expected to remain in place. The rebranding could begin as early as 2018, sources say, and no personnel changes are expected to be made at this time. Representatives for Viacom and Spike declined comment, though a formal rollout strategy is expected to be part of Thursday's call. \nIt's unclear what the rebranding would mean for Spike's current lineup, which includes upcoming scripted foray The Mist as well as unscripted hits Bar Rescue, Ink Master, Lip Sync Battle and more. Newly-minted Viacom CEO Bob Bakish is said to be plotting a strategy for the company that's similar to the Walt Disney Co., which has had great success around its own namesake network, in creating branded entertainment that can be exploited across platforms. \nSuch a move would allow Paramount to better define itself. It's no secret that the studio has struggled in recent years; in January, Bakish had to brush off reports that Viacom was considering a sale of Paramount — assuring a crowd at a programming conference that the brand will be \"a much more integral part of Viacom moving forward.\" \nGood for Paramount has been been the TV business' ability to monetize the film studio's library with upcoming series including Star Trek: Discovery (CBS All Access), Jack Ryan (Amazon) and USA Network's Shooter — among others. Other upcoming credits include TNT's upcoming The Alienist, Netflix's 13 Reasons Why and Maniac. \n2017 is shaping up to be a big year for cable rebranding. Just last week, Oxygen confirmed its shift to a crime-focused network . It's part of a growing trend among ratings-challenged niche channels, as the cable ecosystem braces for a potential a la carte world. Whatever Viacom's larger plans, Bakish has wasted no time in changing up the executive roster. After a year of a great many changes at the individual networks, Doug Herzog, formerly president of the music and entertainment group, exited Viacom in December after a decades-long tenure overseeing such networks as MTV, VH1, Logo, Spike and Comedy Central.
