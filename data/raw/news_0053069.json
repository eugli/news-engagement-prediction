(supplied) Related Stories More emergency training needed for dentists doing sedation, says expert \nAn Edmonton dentist and his staff failed to provide basic care to a young girl who stopped breathing during an office visit in September, according to statement of claim filed this month. \nAmber Athwal's family is suing Dr. William Mather and eight staff members who were on duty that day at the Scotia Place office for a total of $26.5 million, plus costs. \n\"Amber's injuries were caused by a lack of oxygen to her brain over a sustained period of time and were entirely avoidable through the provision of basic medical care,\" according to the claim, filed earlier this month in the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta. More emergency training needed for dentists doing sedation, says expert \nOn Sept. 7, Mather examined the four-year-old girl and told her father, Ramandeep Singh, that four teeth had to be removed. \nMather said a cancellation that morning had freed him up to perform the surgery and that he would do so despite knowing Amber had eaten breakfast, the claim alleges. \nDuring the hour-long procedure, Mather performed the dental work and was also responsible for administering and monitoring the anesthesia. \nAt 11:55 a.m., the surgery completed, Amber was placed in recovery. Staff failed to ventilate Amber, claims says \nThe events that happened next are unclear, according to the lawsuit. \n\"According to the only recorded notes, at or around 12:15 p.m. — and despite the fact that Amber was or should have been on continuous, alarmed monitoring — the (nurse) apparently noticed for the first time that Amber was not breathing, she did not have a heart rate, and that Amber's oxygen saturation level was zero.\" \nEMS was called at 12:30 p.m., the claim states, and when paramedics arrived five minutes later, Amber was lying unresponsive on the clinic floor. \n\"Neither Dr. Mather nor any of the other defendants were making any effort to ventilate Amber through the use of either bag valve mask ventilation, intubation or other means,\" the claim states. \n\"Dr. Mather and all of the other defendants know, or ought to have known, that Amber was not receiving oxygen to her brain and was suffering a critical medical emergency.\" \nAmber was taken to Stollery Children's Hospital, where she stayed for 12 days after being diagnosed with hypoxic brain injury. \nThe lawsuit accuses Mather and his colleagues of failing in their obligations to exercise reasonable care of their patient. \nFailing to \"monitor an unconscious and vulnerable child in the post-operative period fall(s) well below the basic standards of safe patient care,\" the claims says. \nIt also claims Mather failed to take into account that Amber ate breakfast that morning. \nGoing ahead with the surgery despite the fact that Amber had eaten breakfast \"constitutes a breach of the most basic standards of safe and prudent dental and anesthetic care,\" the claim says. \nNone of the allegations contained in the lawsuit have been proven in court. \nA statement of defence has not yet been filed. \nMather has been ordered to attend a hearing conducted by the Alberta Dental Association and College. A date has not been set. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:02:50.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
