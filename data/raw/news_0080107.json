What will they think if I speak to the media now? But I will call you when the time comes,\" Babul told bdnews24.com on Sunday. \n\"Many people are saying many things. But I am not saying anything. I am being with my children. They are my life. I want to forget many things for them,\" he added. On Monday, he wrote the over 2,000-word Facebook post titled \"Everyone is a judge, and I am the murderer without any evidence.\"\nBabul made the headlines after Mitu was murdered in the port city in June 5 last year just days after he had joined his new workplace in Dhaka following a successful drive against militants in Chittagong. \nHe had been living in his in-laws' house afterwards. Speculations and rumours ran wild when the Mitu murder investigators picked him up from the house for questioning. \nHis in-laws were at his side at the time. They, however, changed the tone when Babul left the police job and the house. \nHe made headlines again recently when sub-inspector Akram Hossain's sisters alleged Babul 'plotted the murder' of their brother over the extramarital affair with Akram's wife Banani Binte Bashir Borni. \nThey alleged Babul and Borni 'plotted the murder' in such a way that it looked like a road traffic accident. \nBorni denied having any relationship with Babul. \nLater on Sunday, Babul's father-in-law Mosharraf, himself a former police officer, told bdnews24.com: \"We have told the investigator in detail about Babul's extramarital affair, quarrel with Mitu, her attempt to commit suicide, and failed attempt to come to us.\" \nIn reaction to Mosharraf's comments, Babul wrote, \"I don't have any headache over those. I am busy with the two motherless children now. Besides this, proving the charges is the duty of the people who brought those.\" \n\"...They (his in-laws) had insisted on one thing: 'I will have to marry their girl and stay there.\" \n\"...How did they let their daughter stay with me even after knowing that I had an extramarital affair?\" he asked. He admitted that Akram's wife lived in his area in Magura and took legal help from his lawyer brother. \"But I was not involved with that,\" he wrote.\n\"If living in the same area means having an extramarital affair, then the list of my girlfriends beyond marriage will start at the Northern Hemisphere and won't stop at the Southern Hemisphere,\" he added. \nThe investigator of Mitu murder case, Detective Branch officer Md Kamruzzaman, spoke to his former colleague Babul along with the victim's parents and sisters. \nPolice said seven people have so far been arrested over the murder. Two of them were killed in so-called gunfight with police. \nPolice named Kamrul Islam Shikder alias Musa, a source of Babul when he was posted in Chittagong, as the prime suspect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:02:16.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
