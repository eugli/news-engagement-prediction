Mercury Press/Caters News By Madison Feller Jan 31, 2017 After Sophie Murray's son Finley was born in March 2015, her sister noticed something weird about the shape of the baby's head. According to The Daily Mail , Finley had a triangular-shaped skull. \"As Finley got bigger and bigger his head got more and more triangular,\" Murray told The Mail . \"He had a ridge that stuck out running down his forehead and a permanent vein down his nose that looked like a bruise.\" Murray added that he would frequently viral infections, and that \"it got to the point where every day he would be clutching his head and screaming from the pain.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Mercury Press/Caters News After being repeatedly brushed off by her doctors, Murray took matters into her own hands and sent pictures to four specialist centers, who she says responded to her within minutes, letting her know that Finley's condition was serious. A surgeon booked Finley for an appointment and CT scan a week later, and then surgery a week after that. It turns out Finley had a condition called metopic synostosis, a type of craniosynostosis. According to the Boston Children's Hospital , craniosynostosis occurs when sutures, the fibrous joints between plates, fuse too early in a developing infant's skull. Children with metopic synostosis will have a noticeable ridge along their foreheads and a pointed, triangular shape to the front and top of their skulls. In this case, the ridge was literally squeezing Finley's brain.

Finley was 17 months when he received his surgery. \"They cut his head open from ear-to-ear, and the surgeon said when they opened up his skull, Finley's brain was bulging at the top from where it had been so squashed,\" Murray said. \"They cut off bits of his skull and put them back together like a jigsaw. All his face bones had to be pushed forward.\" Mercury Press/Caters News Even before the surgery, Murray says Finley's development had delayed. He didn't crawl until he was one, and he couldn't speak. But since the surgery, he has learned to say two words: \"mama\" and \"pear.\" Mercury Press/Caters News Now, Murray wants to share Finley's story to raise awareness of his condition. \"Without the surgery, Finley would have had serious development issues, he would have had facial deformities, he would have been bullied at school. That is the opposite of what you want for your child,\" Murray said. \"And Finley is doing amazingly since... I'm so proud of him.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T12:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T08:50:10.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
