But the differences become more clear as the book progresses and the Fergusons start making drastically different choices from one another. \nDespite its publication date, 4 3 2 1 is very much a novel of the 20th century. The Fergusons all bear witness to the assassinations and riots that marked the 1960s and '70s, but Auster wisely chooses not to make Ferguson a Forrest Gump-type character, implausibly present for every significant historical moment. He also gives each iteration a subtle self-awareness about their parallel existences: One of them, at a fairly young age, thinks \"One of the odd things about being himself ... was that there seemed to be several of him, that he wasn't just one person but a collection of contradictory selves, and each time he was with a different person, he himself was different as well.\" \nThere aren't many authors who could pull an 880-page novel like this off, and it's a little surprising that Auster manages to do it so well. That's not because he's not a great writer, but he's never been known for his loquacity or long, flowing sentences before. But he's a gifted observer, and his writing is so energetic, he makes it work with passages like this: \"Adolescence feeds on drama, it is most happy when living in extremis , and Ferguson was no less vulnerable to the lure of high emotion and extravagant unreason than any other boy his age ...\" \nOccasionally, Auster goes on a little too long ... Nonetheless, it's a stunningly ambitious novel, and a pleasure to read. Michael Schaub \nOccasionally, Auster goes on a little too long — the novel is perhaps a bit longer than it needs to be. And his exuberant writing can get the best of him, like when he describes two teenagers kissing: \"... a delicious slobber of flailing tongues and clanking teeth, instant arousal in the rambunctious nether zones of their postpubescent bodies ...\" (There's no accounting for taste, of course, but I probably don't need to read the phrase \"rambunctious nether zones,\" evocative though it may be, ever again.) \nNonetheless, it's a stunningly ambitious novel, and a pleasure to read. Auster's writing is joyful, even in the book's darkest moments, and never ponderous or showy. \"Time moved in two directions because every step into the future carried a memory of the past,\" one of the Fergusons muses, \"... and while all people were bound together by the common space they shared, their journeys through time were all different, which meant that each person lived in a slightly different world from everyone else.\" Auster proves himself a master of navigating these worlds, and even though all might not happen for the best in any of them, it's an incredibly moving, true journey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T14:11:47.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
