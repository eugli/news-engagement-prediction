The Davao City mayor herself confirmed her own death in response to fake news and online trawling. \nPosting a screenshot of a fake news website, the mayor, daughter of President Rodrigo Duterte, sarcastically expressed her annoyance to a post the claimed that she died from an illness. \n“We regret to confirm the untimely demise of Inday Sara,” she said. “It is truly sad for those who sincerely love her and a happy day for those who hate her guts.” ADVERTISEMENT \nThe article, which was posted last Tuesday, said she was rushed that day after complaining of chest pains. \nIt claimed that the death was confirmed by her brother, Davao Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte, on Twitter. \nBut Inday Sara, in a Facebook post on Thursday, said her funeral was not open to the public. \n“Before she died she requested for a private wake for family members only,” she said in her post. “Please omit flowers and pray that she goes to heaven and not hell.” \nDuterte also said she would buried “alongside nothing in her prepaid memorial lot in Davao City.” \nFake news has recently become a serious concern in the Philippines with different political camps accusing each other of perpetrating it. \nA legislative move is now in Congress to explore means how to control these kinds of social media behavior. \nThough some sectors support the move, others are concerned that it may also suppress freedom of expression. /atm/rga", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:02:33.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
