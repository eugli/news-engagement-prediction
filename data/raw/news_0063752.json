She wrote a different friend: “Behind every great man is a woman dedicated to his greatness whilst behind every great woman is a man dedicated to bringing her down.” Carter’s first novel, “Shadow Dance,” appeared in 1966. By 1972 she had published five more. Her life changed when she went to live in Tokyo for two years on prize money from a Somerset Maugham Award. In Japan she took on a younger lover, the first of several in her life. About one, she commented: “Every time I pull down his underpants, I feel more & more like Humbert Humbert.” Sex was important to Carter and she wrote about it beautifully, in her fiction and in the letters and journals of which Gordon makes use. In her book “The Sadeian Woman” (1979), she wrote, “We do not go to bed in simple pairs; even if we choose not to refer to them, we still drag there with us the cultural impedimenta of our social class, our parents’ lives, our bank balances.” Carter never learned to drive or ride a bike. She was a savage smoker of cigarettes. “When she was writing,” Gordon says, “smoke would curl out from the keyhole in her room.” She was, oddly, to borrow a phrase from Kingsley Amis, a “mean sod” about alcohol. “Guests often felt frustrated by her habit of pouring them a single glass of wine,” Gordon writes, “then corking the bottle and putting it back in the fridge, never to emerge again.” She returned from Japan to a changing literary world in London. She assisted her friend Kazuo Ishiguro in finding an agent. She helped usher Pat Barker into print. She befriended Salman Rushdie and Ian McEwan. \n  There was a boom in British fiction in the early 1980s, with Rushdie, Ishiguro, McEwan and Martin Amis at its vanguard. “Angela missed out on all this,” Gordon writes. Her book advances, unlike theirs, did not soar. She always felt she had never quite broken through. Selling each new book, Gordon tells us, was a struggle. It is hard to see why. Carter wrote some of the 20th century’s unforgettable first sentences. Her novel “The Passion of New Eve” (1977) begins this way: “The last night I spent in London, I took some girl or other to the movies and, through her mediation, I paid you a little tribute of spermatozoa, Tristessa.” Carter ultimately married again, to a construction worker 15 years her junior, and had her only child, a son, at 43. After her death, Rushdie wrote that “English literature has lost its high sorceress, its benevolent white witch.” This biography is witchy, in the best sense, as well. \nFollow Dwight Garner on Twitter: @dwightgarner A version of this review appears in print on February 22, 2017, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Wild, Savage, Unforgettable And Disruptive.
