But if you use it heavily, you'll need to recharge it more often. Batteries also lose steam over time, running down faster the longer you've owned the phone. The spectre of losing battery -- and therefore losing your communication hub -- is frightening and real.\nIf you feel your handset battery seems to be stuck in the '90s and doesn't last as long as you'd like, you're not alone. So if a long-life battery tops your list of smartphone needs, check out these top-scorers -- they lasted impressively long during our lab tests for continuous video playback on Airplane mode.\nEditors' note: This post updates frequently. It was originally published October 31, 2011. With the Z Play, you get a long battery life at an affordable price. \nSarah Tew/CNET Motorola Moto Z Play As the cheapest, most \"midrange\" phone of Motorola's Moto Z series, we were stunned to see that the Moto Z Play not only had the longest battery life of the Z line, but of all the handsets we reviewed in 2016 and beyond. Clocking in a whopping 23 hours and 3 minutes, this handset is worth getting for the battery life alone (aside from the fact that it also works with useful modular accessories). Its Z Force counterpart didn't do so shabbily either, with a time of 16 hours and 32 minutes of video playback.

Its robust 4,000mAh battery will also survive throughout the workday and then some. In our tests, it lasted 18 hours and 35 minutes easily.

Instead, we mean only the Galaxy S7 Active , the S7 Edge and the S7 . In addition to being top-tier devices (with the Active being extra durable) they clocked in battery run times over 21, 19 and 16 hours, respectively.

AU$580), the 3T replaces the company's last OnePlus 3 flagship with a more powerful Snapdragon 821 processor and a sharper front-facing camera. It also has a bigger battery that lasts over 16 hours. You still get OnePlus' trademark Dash charging technology, which means the device charges super quickly.
