McMillan constructed a sideline play against the Houston Rockets during an officials’ replay review with 43.6 seconds. \nMcMillan designed the play for the ball to be in Paul George’s hands – and only in Paul George’s hands – once the inbounds pass was completed. The Pacers, clinging to a small lead, executed McMillan’s plan. George used a screen from Myles Turner and found himself free for a midrange jumper. \nGeorge, however, manipulated three Rockets into swarming him, which allowed him to find a wide open C.J. Miles in the corner. Without hesitation, Miles swished the 3-pointer with 40.8 seconds left for the game’s biggest basket. \nIn front of a national TV audience, the Pacers produced one of their most thrilling comebacks of the season for a 117-108 victory. \n“He just made a read and I was just staying ready,” Miles said of George’s assist. “That’s a growth moment. It’s a lot of plays that over time we talk about in hindsight about how I could have did this or I could have did that. I just think playing the game the right way, seeing each other, it’s him trusting us (as teammates). He made a pass and my job is to knock that shot down for him.” \nAfter the play, the first teammate to scream and high-five Miles in the team’s celebration was George. \n“That’s how I’ve been taught to play the game,” George said. “That’s how I’m always going to play the game. I trust my teammates and I rely on my teammates. Everybody’s got to feel that way and I try to night in and night out emphasis that.” \nAlthough George scored just 15 points, he was masterful with the ball in the second half. He recorded five assists and collecting seven rebounds, including the most precious one to seal the victory. Jeff Teague powered Indiana’s offense with 25 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Rodney Stuckey was also instrumental off the bench with 17 points. \nThe Pacers’ performance was remarkable for two reasons. They showed their resiliency by rallying from a 17-point deficit by outrebounding the Rockets 55-39. They also showed maturity by sharing the ball more as the game progressed for 29 assists. \n“This is the first game I felt like we really just stuck together,” Teague said. “Nobody really got down. We all were just kind of cheering each other on and kept competing. The second unit did a great job of just bringing it.” \nThe Pacers (31-29) began the game in abysmal fashion. \nThey looked lackadaisical on defense, confused on offense. The Rockets, feeding off their home crowd, started the game on a bludgeoning 18-2 run. During that stretch, the Pacers showed the type of body language that will usually get a team embarrassed. George dropped his head after turnovers. Miles missed a 3-pointer by 2 feet. Thaddeus Young couldn’t convert on layups within 2 feet. \nDuring a timeout, several Pacers used the same phrase to motivate each other: Stay together. \n“We didn’t have time at that point to get on ourselves and try to win that game alone,” George said. “We had to do it together and we did a great job of collecting our thoughts. We went to the bench and we talked and we won every quarter after the first.” \nAfter such a terrible start, McMillan began playing rare lineup combinations. He eventually found better energy and effort from his bench. McMillan then experimented with three-guard combinations – mostly of Teague, Stuckey and Monta Ellis – that produced efficient offense. By halftime, the Pacers led 59-58. \n“When teams go small, we’ve got to matchup with them,” Stuckey said. “We pretty much know each position. It’s very normal to us and we’re used to it. We needed this win.” Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:46:06.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
