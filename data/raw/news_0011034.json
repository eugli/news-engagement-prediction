Credit: Frank Hoensch/Getty \nRaucous rockers Deftones and Rise Against will partner up for a co-headlining tour this summer. Related Deftones Talk Band Tension: 'We Like Unnerving Feelings' Chino Moreno, Stephen Carpenter and the rest of the group discuss the making of \"silky\" yet \"punishing\" eighth LP, 'Gore' \n\"We've been talking to Rise about touring together for a while now. Finally, everything aligned and we get to spend the summer playing shows with our friends. We couldn't be more excited and can't wait to see you at the shows,\" Deftones said in a statement. \nRise Against added, \"Every once in awhile you get to share the stage with a band so powerful they make you work harder. After conspiring for years, we're excited to finally share the road with such an epic band. We can’t wait to put Deftones and Rise Against fans under the same roof in 2017.\" \nDeftones released Gore , their first album in four years, in April 2016. Rise Against, meanwhile, have largely been on a break since the arrival of their 2014 LP The Black Market ; in 2013, singer Tom McIlrath told Rolling Stone the band needed to \"recharge batteries\" after a grueling two years on the road touring. \nThe 21-date jaunt, which also includes special guests Thrice, kicks off June 9th in Chicago and concludes a month later in Phoenix on July 9th. Tickets go on sale February 10th local time; visit the Deftones' site for complete details. \nDeftones & Rise Against Tour Dates \nJune 9 - Chicago, IL @ Huntington Bank PavilionJune 10 - Sterling Heights, MI @ Michigan Lottery TheaterJune 11 - Toronto, ON @ Budweiser StageJune 13 - Wantagh, NY @ Nikon at Jones Beach TheaterJune 16 - Boston, MA @ Blue Hills Bank PavilionJune 17 - Philadelphia, PA @ Festival PierJune 18 - Raleigh, NC @ Red Hat AmphitheaterJune 20 - Charlotte, NC @ Charlotte Metro Credit Union AmphitheatreJune 22 - Tampa, FL @ MidFlorida Credit Union AmphitheatreJune 23 - Miami, FL @ Bayfront Park AmphitheaterJune 24 - Jacksonville, FL @ Daily’s Place AmphitheaterJune 26 - The Woodlands, TX @ Cynthia Woods Mitchell PavilionJune 27 - Dallas, TX @ Starplex PavilionJune 28 - Austin, TX @ Austin360 AmphitheaterJune 30 - Denver, CO @ Pepsi CenterJuly 1 - Salt Lake City, UT @ USANA AmphitheaterJuly 3 - Seattle, WA @ White River AmphitheatreJuly 6 - Concord, CA @ Concord PavilionJuly 7 - Chula Vista, CA @ Sleep Train AmphitheatreJuly 8 - Las Vegas, NV @ Downtown Las Vegas Events CenterJuly 9 - Phoenix, AZ @ Ak-Chin Pavilion More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:12:14.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
