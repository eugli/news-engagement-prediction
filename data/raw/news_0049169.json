Claire was told she had a form of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) (Photo: Facebook/Support Claire's Battle) She was later told her health problems may have stemmed from a form of Lyme disease (Photo: Facebook/Support Claire's Battle) \n\"It pains me to have to say that our beautiful Claire died on Monday, February 13. \n\"Claire had become so very ill and was admitted to hospital on Sunday, February 5 with a chest infection and subsequently pneumonia. Claire was able to be transferred to Farleigh Hospice and left us peacefully on Monday morning. \n\"I don't know where to begin to thank all the amazing people who have helped Claire with her battle.\" \nHe then signed off the post with: \"Wherever you are imagining Claire is right now, she is able to run, jump and show us that wonderful smile. She will be hugging Emilie and dancing around us all, finally able to move her body again.\" Read More Mum with Lyme disease releases harrowing footage to warn others about agony of infection \nClaire underwent more than a year of tests before being told in November 2015 that she had a form of motor neurone disease called ALS and given a life expectancy of just two to five years. \nLater, after a friend suggested she look into the possibility she may have Lyme disease, she underwent a test in the UK with initial results coming back negative. \nBut after further blood tests at a specialist clinic in Germany she was told she did have the disease - as well as various multiple co-infections - and that her other health problems stemmed from the strain. (Photo: Facebook/Support Claire's Battle) \nThe mum-of-one then travelled to the US where she was diagnosed with advanced chronic Lyme neuroborreliosis, and began specialist treatment. \nA doctor in the US suggested giving her antibiotic therapy and, along with other fees and test costs, meant the family were facing a bill of around £100,000. \nFamily and friends decided to try to raise around £60,000 of the total and eventually reached almost £50,000 in pledges. \nHowever, she passed away on Monday, February 13, after contracting pneumonia linked to her various illnesses. \nLast year, speaking to Chelmsford Weekly News, her sister, Laura Butler, said: “We’ve been told there isn’t any treatment available on the NHS or privately in the UK, so we’re raising money to pay for her treatment in Washington. \n\"It’s been really good for us all to have a focus, Claire was getting quite low, but this has given us hope.
