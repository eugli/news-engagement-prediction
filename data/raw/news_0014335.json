Monday to talk about his crucial game-tying two-point conversion and to offer some insider info about the biggest party animal at the team’s Super Bowl party.\nSurprisingly, Amendola didn’t pick the party-rocking Rob Gronkowski when Kimmel asked who he was “most worried about” at the party.\n“My teammate, Chris Hogan,” Amendola replied. “It was his first Super Bowl win. He played in Buffalo, so we played against him for four years, and then he came over this year, had a great year, stole the show, caught a lot of passes. [He was] one of our best players this year, and after the game he did some questionable activity.”\nAmendola didn’t clarify what the “questionable activity” might have been, but he did mention that he himself spent the party hanging out with Snoop Dogg. When Kimmel asked whether they drug test in the off-season, Amendola replied, “Nah, we’re good,” with a smile.\nThe host also asked the wide receiver about what went through his head when he caught the game-tying two-point conversion that sent the game into overtime.\n“What they were doing defensively, matching up with us throughout the game, I kind of knew the play call when we were getting that close into the red zone, on the 1- or 2-yard line,” Amendola said. “So I knew it was coming, and it was just a matter of executing.”\nThe wide receiver told Kimmel he didn’t shy away from the responsibility of catching the ball on such a monumental play.\n“In a moment like that, do you feel like you’re more or less likely to catch the ball?” Kimmel asked. “Do nerves play a role either way, good or bad?”\n“I ain’t got time for that,” Amendola said.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/dntKjL8b0_A?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9L77BLA2qSw?feature=oembed"], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T18:01:19.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
