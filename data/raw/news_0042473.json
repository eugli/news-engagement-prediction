Many in the crowd chanted ‘No ban, no wall. The Trump regime has got to fall.’ \nThey held aloft signs saying ‘Uphold the Constitution Now’ and ‘Impeach the Liar.’ Protesters in Los Angeles, California.

Demonstrators there called attention to Trump’s crackdown on immigration and his party’s response to climate change and the environment. \nOrganisers said they chose to rally on the holiday as a way to honour past presidents by exercising their constitutional right to assemble and peacefully protest.
