Twelve months ago Cheryl and Liam Payne just about confirmed their relationship – and now the parents-to-be are expecting their first baby! Fans are desperate to know whether the tot has been born, with many speculating that Cheryl will give birth any day now, if she hasn't already. Bets have also been flying around about the baby's sex , with Alfie being tipped as the frontrunner for the name, if the couple do have a boy. \nLooking back over the past year, it's clear that Cheryl, 33, and Liam, 23, are more smitten and stronger than ever. The couple have defied naysayers who claimed that their ten-year age gap meant their relationship was unlikely to last. They made it Instagram official one year ago by posting the cutest loved-up selfie online – the first of several. Liam quickly followed it up with another stunning snapshot of Cheryl, calling her his \"favourite woman in the world\" and adding: \"Hope I make you as happy as u make me.\" VIEW GALLERY Cheryl and Liam Payne made it Instagram official one year ago \nThe pair had been secretly dating since December 2015, shortly after Cheryl split from her second husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini. They enjoyed a string of romantic dates but managed to keep their blossoming relationship on the downlow. In May, the hot new couple made their red carpet debut , attending the Global Gift Gala in Paris. Days later, they stepped out again, this time in Cannes for the Chopard Trophy Ceremony. The pair posed up a storm, putting on an affectionate display and clearly only having eyes for one another. VIEW GALLERY The couple often share cute selfies online \nCheryl had found 'The One' and her broad smile and glowing appearances were thanks to her new boyfriend. The star was also harbouring her and Liam's own little secret – they were having a baby! After months of 'is she, isn't she', Cheryl finally embraced her beautiful baby bump. She seemed to confirm her pregnancy in November as she attended a Christmas carol concert with Liam, showing off her new rounded figure in a khaki green dress. And earlier this month, Cheryl proudly cradled her sizeable bump in a stunning campaign for L'Oreal and The Prince's Trust. VIEW GALLERY Cheryl is expecting her first baby with Liam Payne \nAs the final months of her pregnancy loomed, Cheryl moved out of her six-bedroom house in Hertfordshire and into Liam's countryside mansion in Surrey. The couple will use Liam's home as their base and have reportedly asked their mums to help with the new arrival for the first few weeks. It's been a whirlwind 12 months, going from new couple to parents-to-be. We can't wait to see what the next year will bring!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T19:02:19.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
