Want to find an honest, competent home builder with a great reputation? \nSimple. Visit the Texas licensing website for home builders, study their records and then find a good builder that suits your needs. Voila. \nExcept I made that up. There's no Texas licensing authority, no way to actually check a builder's reputation, outside of referrals, except to go to the courthouse and look up their previous lawsuits. Who does that? \nIf you make the right decision, you'll own a beautiful home and live happily ever after. \nIf you make the wrong decision, your life could be overtaken with a bitter battle against your builder. If matters can't be worked out, the only recourse in Texas is to go to mediation or file an expensive lawsuit in court. \nObviously, the key is to make the right hire. That's why The Watchdog is leading a \"people power\" campaign to persuade lawmakers in Austin to create a state license for roofers and contractors like those required in our sister Gulf states. So far, though, no lawmakers have introduced any such bill. Who to trust? \nThe Watchdog takes up the flag for every home buyer who complains about getting hurt by builders and roofers. It's more than an epidemic of incompetence. In the roofing industry now, it's a crime spree. \nThe Watchdog does this for families like the Greens, the Pettys, the Bottones, the Hoxworths and the Beris. I met them all this week. Each was bit by the same builder. That's rare. Five families all coming forward at the same time to complain about the same builder. \nBut their situation illustrates the confusion that surrounds the Texas home building and repair industries. Who to trust? Dallas builder \nThe builder in today's hot seat is Kevin D. Wiley, president of Tower Custom Homes in Dallas. He's a luxury home builder who puts up $1 million homes in some of North Texas' swankiest neighborhoods. \nWiley the builder played Texas Longhorns football in the 1980s and has run his own business for close to 20 years. \nNow he's embroiled in fights with each of the families over their projects. \n\"This is a pretty ugly and entangled mess,\" he says. \"It's challenged my resources in a lot of ways.\" \nI met the five families in University Park. They joke that they have a name for their group — The Kevin Wiley Support Group. The Beris \nRajive and Lorie Beri hired Wiley to build a McKinney home. \nLast week, they sued Wiley's company, seeking up to $1 million. \nRaj Beri says the builder hasn't paid subcontractors $250,000 he owes them. He estimates he lost $400,000 to Wiley in unpaid bills and improper receipts on his million-dollar home. \nWiley responds that Beri made changes during construction and owes him $100,000. \"He wasn't able to pay the change orders,\" the builder says. \"We shut the job down.\" \nNot so, Beri says. He fired Wiley, not the other way around. Homeowner Rajive Beri has taken legal action against Tower Custom Homes, Tower Building and Remodeling and the owner Kevin Wiley of Dallas. (Photos by Dave Lieber/Staff) The Hoxworths \nRon and Heather Hoxworth knocked down an older home in University Park and hired Wiley to build a new one. There were delays and excuses, more delays and more excuses. Ron Hoxworth kept finding mistakes during construction. \n\"Kevin plays the blame game,\" he says. \"It's always someone else's fault.\" Watchdog: Attention state lawmakers – the case for a roofers/contractors license \nSubcontractors complained they weren't getting paid. Wiley insisted they were. \nWhen the list of problems grew too long, they fired him. The Hoxworths say they lost $70,000 to Wiley. Wiley says they owe him $40,000. \nEach says the other side is lying. Dallas homeowners Heather and Ron Hoxworth have had disputes with Tower Custom Homes, Tower Building and Remodeling and the owner Kevin Wiley of Dallas. The Pettys \nVirginia and Scott Petty fired Wiley, too. Their proposed 12-month University Park project took 29 months. After Wiley left, they say they spent almost $200,000 on repairs from faulty construction. They also sued him. Last week, they spent six hours in a mediation session. \nWiley's lawyer, Israel Suster says, \"When a project is terminated in the middle, there's no opportunity to correct any problems.\" \nWiley says he'll beat this one in court, too. Dallas homeowners Virginia and Scott Petty have had legal disputes with Tower Custom Homes, Tower Building and Remodeling and the owner Kevin Wiley of Dallas. The Bottones \nJohn and Lou Anne Bottone hired Wiley to build a commercial building in Plano. John fired Wiley, too. \n\"He blamed vendors,\" he says. \"But it was Wiley who didn't pay them.\" \nWiley says Bottone owes him money. Business owner John Bottone has had disputes with Tower Custom Homes, Tower Building and Remodeling and the owner Kevin Wiley of Dallas. The Greens \nThe Greens' University Park house burned down on Christmas Day 2012. They hired Wiley to build a replacement. \nSame story. Kyle and Jaquelyn Green fired him after a series of mistakes, including a flood in their kitchen. They sued Wiley. Wiley countersued them. \n\"We built it cheaper than anyone in the world could have,\" Wiley says. \nThe parties are scheduled for mediation in March and court in April. Dallas homeowners Jacquelyn and Kyle Green have had legal disputes with Tower Custom Homes, Tower Building and Remodeling and the owner Kevin Wiley of Dallas. Fix the mess \nWiley says each of the families are fueling one another in their anger toward him. He says the families have \"colluded\" to ruin his reputation. \n\"I have a long track record with a lot of customers in Dallas and the Park Cities that are incredibly happy,\" he says. (Available court records show he's had other lawsuits with vendors, but they were dismissed.) \nOne matter that both sides — Wiley and the Support Group — agree on is the need for licensing. \nTold that the families could then go after his license, Wiley says, \"I don't believe they would have success because I don't believe I've done anything wrong.\" \nSee what a mess this is for everybody? \nNOTE: Want to join my \"people power\" campaign in favor of a contractors/roofers license?
