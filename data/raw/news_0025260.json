Non-oil assets like concession of airports are a more difficult sale because they would involve a lot of transactions.” \nThe government targets oil production of 2.5 million barrels a day by 2020 to boost export earnings, it said in the document. \nOutput declined to an almost three-decade low of 1.4 million barrels per day in August after militants in the Niger Delta bombed pipelines to demand more benefits from the resource. \nOverall, the Federal Government is said to have developed 59 strategies for implementation to achieve the strategic objectives of the Economic Recovery Growth Plan that will be launched in the next few weeks. \nThe document, which is awaiting Federal Executive Council’s endorsement, has twelve strategies that have been prioritised based on their importance to the success of the government recovery plan. \nThose working on the document said the plan would accelerate non-oil revenue generation through expanding the tax base, blocking leakages in tax avoidance and non-payment. \nThe plan is expected to drastically cut cost and align monetary and fiscal policies. The government also during the plan period, will spend heavily to expand critical infrastructure, especially power, roads and rail. \nAnother strategy in the recovery plan is government’s intention to revamp the four existing refineries to ensure local supply of petroleum products in order to conserve foreign exchange. \nIt is also stated in the document, government’s intention to expand its social investment and deliver on agricultural transformation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:26:04.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
