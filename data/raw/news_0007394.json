Is 2face being used to attack Buhari by politicians? Blackface alleged in a post he shared on his Instagram page that 2face is part of the people desperately trying to discredit the Buhari's administration. He said: \"Is it because you are part of desperate plot to poison the hearts and minds against a fantastically incorruptible President who fights the corrupt no matter whose ox is gored?\" Is 2face being used to attack Buhari by politicians? According to blackface, 2face was mute over several allegations against governors who were allegedly misappropriating the bailout funds given to them by President Buhari but he (2face) is quick to call for a protest against the President. Could this be the governor using 2baba to attack Buhari? An alleged investigation by PM news, infers that a former Akwa Ibom state governor is the chief sponsor of the planned massive nationwide protest being orchestrated by 2baba. The protest, planned to hold on Sunday, February 5, had in the last two weeks generated much hue and cry with some Nigerian celebrities queuing behind the move, while others had kicked against the intention. The Benue-born had taken to his Instagram page to confirm that the protest will hold as scheduled . He wrote: “A call for good governance. A call for urgent explanation into the reckless economic downturn nationwide. A call for nationwide protests as we say no to the Executive, no to legislatures, no to judiciary… You have all failed us. Is 2face being used to attack Buhari by politicians? “We the people are tired. We can no longer continue with all of you. All your excuses and mistakes are not funny. We do not wish to continue with a system and government that is not working but afflicting the people…” But on Monday, a source revealed that 2face was being used as a stooge to drive the protest aimed at smearing the Buhari-led Federal Government. According to PM News, this said former governor, now a Senator, has never hidden his love for the ‘African Queen’ crooner and had in the past said to have showered award winning musician with cash and gifts worth several millions of naira. It would be recalled that 2face and his wife, Annie Macaulay, in 2013, were gifted two brand new Prado SUVs by this former governor as their wedding gift which they graciously accepted. 2face has however, come under severe criticism by some fans who feel he was silent during the previous administration where massive corruption, lawlessness and poverty were the order of the day, with some concluding that there was more behind the protest. “2face should come out clean and tell Nigerians the real reason behind this protest rather than hiding under the guise of clamouring for good governance. Where was he during Chief Olusegun Obasanjo era? Where was he when Goodluck Jonathan and his men were ripping Nigeria off? “If he is not careful, this move might just signal the beginning of the end of his musical career. He is threading on a path where he is a complete novice,” the source said. Education versus rationality Following the proposed massive protest against the federal government which is lead by Nigerian music legend 2baba Idibia, Nigerian professor, Akindele Adetoye, has come out to blast the singer over his actions. He said: \"You are a bloody illiterate. You had s*x with all manners of girls without using condoms. You impregnated them and made babies all over the place. You now want to lead protest against the government because of lack of governance! Have you governed your own personal life? Charity, they say begins at home. Nonsense!\" Support from other artistes Regardless what many have said in favour and against 2baba's proposed protest, some very popular musicians like Burna Boy and Davido have publicly promised to join the march . Similarly, Ruggedman, Nigerian hip-hop icon, has slammed fellow veteran Blackface for endorsing a post that derided the activism of 2baba Idibia, his former band mate. Is 2face being used to attack Buhari by politicians? Hours after sharing the post and noting that it was “copied”, Ruggedman responded by saying he was disappointed in Blackface. Apparently oblivious to the fact that Blackface added the caveat “copied”, the rapper said it’s become “too obvious” that Blackface had unresolved issues with 2face. He wrote in part: “This your move right here is very disappointing. You sang hard life and all when things were even a bit bearable, but now that things are really messed up you have kept quiet but here you are mouthing off over a 2face move? The reply by the veteran rapper fully reads: \"BLACKFACE FACE WHAT'S REAL @blackfacenaija you be my guy and@official2baba na my guy but I will tell you that this your move right here is very disappointing. You sang hardlife and all when things were even a bit bearable, but now that things are really messed up you have kept quiet. But here you are mouthing off over a 2Face move? Guy you fall my hand. Talking about educating people 1. It is not a protest being lead by 2face. He said he saw the post and thought to lend his voice to it. Something a few other artists and people have done. 2. So you knew about all the governors embezzling funds and yet you said nothing. But you are quick to shout now because 2face name has come out on something. But you make it too obvious you have something against 2face and you should have let all this go by now. NIGERIANS are suffering and you are just monitoring 2face. Atleast he has chosen to lend his voice to something all Nigerians believe is needed. What have you done? You have details that should be out there for all to see but you only decided to speak cos 2face is involved. Guy change your ways. I know you as a crusader and not a 2face hater. The people need voices that can be heard, I know you are one of them. Do the right thing brother. Life in Naija now is harder than it ever was and Buharis people should let Nigerians know what they are doing right and also let Nigerians know who and who is doing wrong. You cant say you are doing great things when the people cant feel it. You cant say you are fighting corruption yet not one corrupt official has been jailed in 2 years.\" Further investigations into this case are ongoing, as we are yet to get a concrete reply from 2face who have been accused of delving into politic as a puppet for the yet to be named politician.
