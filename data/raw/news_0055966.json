Franks, Bielema said he expects Scott to recruit the Atlanta area, as well as North and South Carolina. \nWalker is more of a wild card when it comes to a particular recruiting region. \n“E.K. and I had a sit down two days ago and were kind of finalizing things as we get ready to move into spring ball,” Bielema said. “I think Chad is one of those guys that really can go in and do anything.” \nBecause of his time at Bryant, an FCS program in Rhode Island, and Division II Mississippi College, Walker said his recruiting background is along the eastern seaboard and the stretch from Mississippi to San Antonio. \nAt Tuesday’s introductory press conference, Walker’s love for the game and his exciting personality were easily noticeable, making it easy to believe when he said he was “absolutely” ready to get back into recruiting. \nLikewise, Scott was well-spoken and knowledgeable, proving his own assessment of himself as a recruiter. \n“Recruiting is something, for me, that has always come pretty easy,” Scott said. “The good Lord blessed me with a calm personality, a good demeanor, so I’ve never had any problems relating to any type of kid or any situation.” \nIn addition to the areas Bielema mentioned, Scott said he heavily recruited Texas, specifically the Houston area, during his time at Texas Tech. When he was at Missouri State – an FCS program just a couple hours north of Fayetteville – he was tasked with recruiting Tulsa, Okla. \n“You could put me in Timbuktu and I would go out there and find the best player in Timbuktu,” Scott said. “I’d find some sort of common ground. I’ve been very blessed just to have that personality.” \nAnother aspect Bielema said he has to consider is the NCAA rule changes with satellite camps, which he said will be limited to a 10-day window in July. \nThe camps have drawn criticism from most coaches in the SEC, but Bielema seems to like them as evidenced by the signing of Korey Hernandez in the 2017 class and the offering of several other prospects. \nWherever Bielema sends them, Scott said knows that the key will be how well they are able to connect with the recruits they go after. \n“At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter where you go if you can’t build relationships with people and relate to people,” Scott said. “It doesn’t matter if they put you in a hotbed, you’re still not going to recruit any kids to the program. \n“To me, it’s all about relationships.” \nBe sure to enjoy VIP access to Hawgs247 with our free 7-day trial promotional offer.
