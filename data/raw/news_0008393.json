Politicians and pressure groups on both sides declare that they will not support nominees unless they hew to their own partisan creeds. When a favored candidate is voted down for lack of sufficient political sympathy to those in control, grudges are held for years, and retaliation is guaranteed.”\nNow, here sits Gorsuch, the beneficiary of politicians acting on “partisan creeds.”\nHow does he feel about that, I wonder?\nWill he tell the senators at his confirmation hearing that Garland should have been given a hearing?\nJeez, GOP.

This is the first time a Senate majority has stolen a seat. We will use every lever in our power to stop this.\"\nI’m not sure they will, actually. Not enough of them, anyway. They could stall things if they want. Stage a filibuster.
