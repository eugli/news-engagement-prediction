We loved the idea!” the Northampton Police Department announced in a statement Saturday. “Everyone was on board. Principals and teachers communicated the High Five Friday plan to staff, students, and families. We went to all of the elementary schools, exchanged high fives, and even snuck in some playground time with kids.” \nBut apparently not everyone was pleased with the presence of law enforcement at the schools. “While we received a lot of support on social media … concerns were shared that some kids might respond negatively to a group of uniformed officers at their school,” the police department continued on its official Facebook post. “People were specifically concerned about kids of color, undocumented children, or any children who may have had negative experiences with the police.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:46:23.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
