Here he the stands in the middle of a group next to Mayor Robert O'Connor at an event to announce the completion of upgrades at the Route 59 train station in December. (Steve Lord / The Beacon-News) Privacy Policy \nFormer Aurora Mayor Tom Weisner, who stepped away from the job three months ago to focus more on his health, said this week he is feeling \"very good.\" \nWeisner was mayor of the city for 11½ years before retiring about six months before the end of his third term. He had announced about a year before that he would not run for a fourth term, citing his long-time battle with cancer. \nAt the time, Weisner said he was going to be pursuing a treatment that would take more time, and might take away from his ability to be mayor. He also said he needed his privacy. \nHe has been indulging in both since that time, although he appeared in public again this week at the dedication and ribbon-cutting for the Aurora St. Charles Senior Living project in the historic former St. Charles Hospital building at 400 E. New York St. \n\"I'm doing great,\" Weisner told The Beacon-News this week. \"I started a new regimen, a new treatment, and I feel very good.\" \nThe Aurora St. Charles project was near and dear to Weisner's heart, and the many partners and investors in the project praised Weisner for the support he gave it during his last year at City Hall. \nOfficials at Evergreen Real Estate Group named the community room in the building – remodeled into the former hospital chapel – after the former mayor. \nWeisner just returned from a vacation in Florida, and said he has had time to read again – tackling three books since he has left office. \nOne is \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" by J.D. Vance, a popular book that talks about growing up poor and white in Appalachia, another is \"Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City\" by Matthew Desmond, which follows the fate of poor people facing eviction in Milwaukee. \nThe third book is \"Behind the Beautiful Forevers\" by Katherine Boo, a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer who paints a picture of what it's like to live in Mumbai, India. \nWeisner pointed out that all three books deal with poverty, and what it's like for the poor in different communities and cultures. \n\"I know, I didn't pick very light reading,\" he said, with a smile. \nWeisner will continue to be active, particularly with some of the regional issues he championed more and more during his time as mayor. \nHe will speak before the Joliet City Council next week, at the invitation of Mayor Bob O'Dekirk, on the many issues involving area water supplies. \nAurora passed a water conservation ordinance in 2006, pushed by the mayor at the time. \nHe also helped create the Northwest Water Planning Alliance, which took in many municipalities and counties in the area to take a regional look at water conservation and demand. Eventually, the alliance passed a regional conservation ordinance and Aurora adjusted its ordinance to mesh with what other cities were doing. \nAs far as his regional interest goes, Weisner also became involved in the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, the Mayors and Managers Conference and the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus. \nHe also made headlines as a driving force behind the regional effort to get Canadian National to pay for upgrading railroad crossings and safety after it took over the former Elgin, Joliet and Eastern railroad tracks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:07:24.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
