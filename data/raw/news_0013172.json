DREAM MATCHES \nCena has also taken on The Rock on two occasions, while Shawn Michaels is an opponent fans want Styles to face off against. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

Article continues below \nIt’s obvious that the crowd would have loved it at the time, but for some reason, it just never came to fruition. \nFinally, we have answers. \nFormer WWE creative team member, Bruce Prichard, revealed on his podcast that WWE had firm plans to do Austin vs. Hogan. AUSTIN VS. HOGAN \nHowever, the idea was to allow the Hulkster to battle The Rock first and build towards a match with the Rattlesnake as it was seen as the bigger match out of the two. \nHe said: “Well, I can tell you from my vantage point and my discussions were, where are we going to go because the match was Austin and Hulk or Rock and Hulk. \n“I think everyone agreed that Austin and Hulk were the bigger match that we had to get to, so the feeling was, why not give it to them first, let’s build it some more. \n“Rock and Hogan were interchangeable in their careers.” \nTheir match at WrestleMania X8 was so well received by fans that WWE didn’t think they could match up to it by having Austin battle Hogan the following year, or at any other event. \nNot only that, Prichard has revealed there might have been some discussions that one didn’t want to lose to the other. \nHe added: “Originally, it was planned for Rock and Hulk and then eventually get to Austin and Hulk at some point, whether that be at the next WrestleMania or not. \n“There may have been discussions where one wasn’t going to put the other over, but that was just gesturing and positioning.” \nThat alone tells you just how big of a star The Rock was, as he was powerful enough to help scupper plans of another huge match through no fault of his own. \nWho do you think would have won in an Austin vs. Hogan dream match?
