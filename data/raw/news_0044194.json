Levent Kulu / Getty \nLONDON — Rolex watches have long been seen as status symbols for the rich and famous. Now research has shown that the reputation is fully justified. \nInsurance firm HomeProtect investigated the types of people who own Rolex watches in the UK and where they are located. \nThe data, drawn from its 8,000 customers , showed that the average cost of a Rolex is at least £5,000 ($6,300). It also revealed: \n1. The average Rolex owner is a 68-year-old male \nMost Rolex are owned by retired men, according to the study. It showed that the average age of a Rolex owner in the UK is 68, with 66% of people surveyed over the age of 65, and only 1.5% under 35. Male owners also outnumber women by almost two to one. 2. The majority are found in south east England and London \nHomeProtect \nSome 29% of Rolex watches in the UK are found in the south east and London. Elsewhere, 15% are found in the east Midlands, 11% in the west Midlands, and 10% in the north west. \nLondon suburbs have a larger number of Rolex owners than central. Redhill, Kingston Upon Thames, Rochester, and Chelmsford all appear in the top 10, alongside the affluent south London areas of Twickenham and Bromley. These areas also have a higher than average population of people in retirement. 3. Managers or directors are more likely to own a Rolex \nHomeProtect \nSome 7.2% of Rolex owners are company directors, with managing directors close behind. Over 20% of owners have either manager or director in their job title. \nBut there was some surprises. 3.5% of owners were housewives, over 465 (1.3%) were police officers, and 175 (0.5%) were receptionists. Hairdressers, dog groomers, classical musicians, and even dinner ladies also featured on the list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T12:06:34.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
