(Vision courtesy ABC News 24) More videos They're coming for your frequent flyer points \nJust when you think the risk of identity theft and cyber fraud means youâll have to leave your credit cards in a safe, here's another one. The scumbags are stealing your frequent flyer points. \nQantas won't divulge just how common frequent flyer identity theft is, but it's common. (The airline, like the banks being a bit vague about the extent of credit card fraud, says it's a security issue, not wanting to encourage the criminals. I suspect it's also a little embarrassing.) \nQantas is fighting back by beefing up its cyber security. Starting from Thursday, it's rolling out a trial of \"a second-factor authentication process\" – geek speak for texting you a code before you can log on to your account, the same way banks SMS a security code for many online payments. Related Content Qantas profit slides after 'unprecedented airfare' discounts \nOK, having your frequent flyer membership identity stolen is not like losing the deeds to your house or having your life savings cleaned out, but it's still annoying, can represent a considerable loss of value and could be part, or the start, of a broader identity theft. \nIn my case, when I was getting on a Qantas flight from Los Angeles to Sydney earlier this month, a low life used my points to buy a ticket from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh city on Jetstar Pacific. An alarm rang in Qantas and the ticket was cancelled, but the fraudsters had another crack closer to flight time and got away with it.

There are 11.5 million Qantas frequent flyer accounts – how many of us ever check the points unless we're about to try to use them? \nSatisfied that it was a fraud, Qantas quickly refunded the points and is happy to give tips about protecting your identity.
