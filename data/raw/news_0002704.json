We have banned r/altright due to repeated violations of the terms of our content policy. There is no single solution to these issues and we are actively engaging with the Reddit community to improve everyone’s experience.”\nReddit did not make it explicit which content infringed its rules, but it is believed to be attempts to dox the protestor who punched a white nationalist during a TV interview at Donald Trump’s inauguration.\nSpeaking to the Daily Beast , one Reddit moderator claimed that the ban was instead a result of its “record monthly traffic” (Reddit moderators, like the creators of individual subreddits, are all volunteers with no official relationship to the site’s staff). “It’s clear that Reddit banned us because we were becoming very popular and spreading inconvenient truths about who’s ruining our country and robbing our children of a future,” the moderator said.\nDoxing is one of Reddit’s few red lines when it comes to site-wide offences, alongside posting illegal content, inciting violence, or threatening, harassing or bullying people. It was banned on the site even before Reddit instituted rules banning sexually suggestive content featuring minors .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:47:28.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
