Hydro made headlines earlier this month when it announced over 900 positions, or almost 15 per cent of its workforce, would be eliminated in a sweeping move to cut down on costs. The measure will save $65 million, but Shepherd admits isn't enough to cover the billions of debt carried by the province.\nManitoba Hydro to shrink workforce by roughly 900 positions Manitoba Hydro's walking on a tightrope — or is it? Built into the Crown corporation's 20-year plan from 2015 is 13 years of 3.95 per cent increases, followed by two per cent increases in the subsequent years. \nSanford Riley, chair of the Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board, says Hydro's operations are going to require a significant restructuring that will not be pleasant for staff. (CBC)\nSanford Riley, the chair of Hydro's board, has warned even higher rates — into the double digits — would be needed to get a handle on Hydro's burgeoning $13-billion debt-burden and increasingly low debt-to-equity ratio.\nShepherd isn't ready to tip his hand and say what increases Hydro will apply for this fiscal year, but said all signs point to a change in direction and asking for a hike higher than 3.95 per cent.\nPlans for 'double-digit' hydro rate hike worry business owners and poverty advocates \"We are going to have to raise rates faster,\" he said. \"I think we are going to look at something different than 3.95 per cent.\"\nOne credit analyst says the Crown corporation's ability to raise rates has been used by credit agencies to justify the idea that Hydro can remain a self-supporting utility. Plus, Manitobans enjoy some of the cheapest rates in the country. \n\"There is a lot more room for (Manitoba) to increase rates, unlike a province such as Ontario,\" said Tom Li, a utility credit analyst with DBRS, which released its outlook on Hydro in September.\n\"It shows how much flexibility there is for a utility to be able to increase its rates to recover costs.\"\nEchoes of the 1970s  Historical data provided by Manitoba Hydro show a correlation between increased rates and massive capital investments by the public utility. The utility stands in a similar position today as it was in the 1970s when Hydro was at various stages of building the $226-million Churchill Diversion, along with several other massive projects.\nDuring this period, Manitobans saw the greatest rate increases in the public utility's history. Shepherd describes that era as a \"different world\" when interest rates had skyrocketed and the corporation's capital investments, by scale, were more massive than recent projects.\nSix years of double-digit rate increases followed, beginning with a 20.6 per cent increase in 1974 — the highest increase in Manitoba Hydro's history. In the subsequent years, double-digit increases between 19.8 and 14.4 per cent continued until 1979.\nThe chair of Manitoba Hydro is calling the utility's financial state a 'ticking time bomb' 2:17\nCurrently, the 695-megawatt  Keeyask  hydroelectric generating station, which is being built on the Nelson River in northern Manitoba, is estimated to cost roughly $7.2 billion. \nBipole III — a 1,341-kilometre, 2,300-megawatt transmission line, running down the west side of Lake Winnipeg — is estimated to cost between $4.65 billion and $5.2 billion to build. \nBipole III route a mistake that can't be changed, Manitoba Hydro board says Manitoba Hydro's Keeyask dam was 'risky investment strategy,' says U.S. energy expert Manitoba Hydro's Bipole III cost shoots up by more than $1B \"My responsibility is to try and bring forward a plan that addresses what we think is reasonable for customers at the same time while addressing the real requirement. We think we have to address the fact we have costs and increase investments we have in the system,\" Shepherd said.\nThe Public Utilities Board ultimately decides on rate increases requested by Hydro, but balked at Hydro's recent 2016-17 increase request of 3.95 per cent, arguing Hydro's finances have shown it could reach its debt-to-equity targets at a lower rate increase.\nIn its most recent decision the PUB allowed a rate increase of 3.36 per cent and dictated the interim rate increase must go into a deferral account to reduce the expected rate shock when Bipole III and Keeyask come into service. By 2018, when the Bipole is scheduled to become operational, nearly $360 million will be in the account to be used to help keep rate increases low, explained a spokesperson for Hydro.\nThe PUB hasn't ruled out accepting a 2017-18 rate increase of 3.95 per cent or higher if the financial situation of Hydro deteriorates to provide a \"financial cushion.\"\nShepherd told CBC News Hydro's 2017-18 rate application won't be filed until the spring, after its 2016 financial forecast is complete.\nExport stability For last decade more than 30 per cent of Manitoba Hydro's revenue has come from exports, bringing in $5.2 billion over 10 years. Bringing Keeyask online is expected to increase those export revenues dramatically, explained Shepherd.\nManitoba Hydro is partially hedging its multibillion-dollar capital program on $4.5 billion in export contracts made possible by Keeyask's capacity. \nShepherd admits, in hindsight, Hydro should have delayed the construction of Keeyask. While he argues Bipole will protect Manitobans from an \"economy-devastating\" blackout event, Keeyask was built to increase export capacity and changing markets have decreased its viability. Export prices are on the decline and alternative energy pushes in the United States have decreased demand, he said.\n\"I think it is fair to say that the economics have deteriorated,\" Shepherd said. \"20/20 hindsight, I would have said, 'Yes, I would have waited.' But I am not faced with that today, I am faced with a project many years in the making and $3 billion already invested.\"\nManitoba Hydro offers solar energy incentive program Hydro chooses final preferred route for Manitoba-Minnesota Transmission Project Four long-term export deals with Minnesota, Wisconsin and Saskatchewan have been signed that are dependent on Keeyask. The utility has sold off all the additional capacity and dependable energy brought on by Keeyask until 2025.\nThe Keeyask generating station's capacity is pre-sold until 2025. (Keeyask Hydropower Limited Partnership.)\nHow much Hydro will make off each individual contracts with Xcel Energy, Minnesota Power, Wisconsin Public Service and SaskPower is confidential. The contracts begin around 2020, with some ending as late as 2040. \nEconomist Brady Yauch described the decision to build Keeyask as a multibillion-dollar gamble that might not pay off, given the current energy market.\n\"Building big megaprojects and dams are always inherently risky. Manitoba Hydro thought they could get them done on time and on budget,\" he said, noting the projected delays and cost increases that have recently been announced.\n\"Industrial demand is … flat so the money they thought they'd get from being a major energy powerhouse in North America didn't materialize.\"\nDave McMillan, Minnesota Power's executive vice-president, says Hydro is the only utility in the area that has the resources and capacity to supply its needs. The private utility is embarking on a plan to rely more heavily on wind energy to supply power to its over 145,000 residential and commercial customers. Keeyask will give Minnesota Power the ability to store power on their system to use when wind levels are low.\nThe contract with Minnesota Power expires in 2035.\nThe Google logo is spelled out in heliostats at the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System in the Mojave Desert. Solar power is making inroads in the U.S., but Hydro could be seen as a dependable backup. (REUTERS/Steve Marcus)\n\"The renewable aspect is huge, as is the battery (power) … For that reason we are willing to pay somewhat of a premium for it,\" he said. \"And 15 to 20 years from now, it will be a resource for Manitobans in the long-haul.\"\nSelling off excess energy, outside of contracts, to the United States — a.k.a \"spot pricing\" — has become increasingly challenging, argued Yauch.\n​Shepherd agreed, saying utility companies are being offered subsidies to use wind or solar energy which is hard to compete with. While volume of export has increased, prices are declining, he said. \nA report released in February by Greentech Media, a U.S.-based clean energy research group, reported solar energy accounted for 39 percent of new capacity additions across all fuel types in 2016.\nAs solar installations multiply, U.S. utility companies fight back Wind, solar energy real options for Canada's remote Arctic communities With excess power up for sale from neighbouring states, the price has been driven down, explained Yauch of the Toronto-based Consumer Policy Institute.\n\"They'll take your power, but if they do it on a market-based price, they are going to do it at a cheap deal,\" he said. \"No one has seen an increase in power prices.\"\n\n\n\nWith files from Sean Kavanaugh", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:18:45.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
