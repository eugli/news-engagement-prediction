The prize money grew to some $403 million after there were no winners in Saturday's drawing, lottery officials said.\nPowerball's jackpot hit a record $1.6 billion in January 2016, when there were three winning tickets sold in California, Florida and Tennessee. The game and a second major U.S. lottery, Mega Millions, have exceeded $400 million only a handful of other times.\nThe odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292 million.\nPowerball tickets are sold in 44 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Players can buy the $2 tickets with their own numbers, or have the numbers randomly generated by a computer.\nThe next drawing is scheduled for 10:59 p.m. ET on Wednesday and the winner would receive annual payments over 29 years or $243.9 million in a lump sum payment, before taxes.\nHalf of Powerball sales goes to prizes, 40 percent to state governments for items such as education and 10 percent to retailers who sell the tickets and for other administrative costs.\nRelated Video: At Least 3 Lucky Winners Will Split Record $1.58B Powerball Jackpot (2016)\nFor more news videos visit Yahoo View , available now on iOS and Android .\nCopy to Clipboard\n(Reporting by David Ingram in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yahoo.view", "https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1149490943?pt=9029&ct=tout&mt=8", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yahoo.view&quot;", "https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1149490943?pt=9029&amp;ct=tout&amp;mt=8&quot;"], "published": "2017-02-22T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:16:46.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
