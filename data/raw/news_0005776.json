immigration ban last week.\nTrump moved to suspend the resettlement of refugees to the United States and deny entry to more than 218 million citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries.\n'Refugees are men, women and children caught in the fury of war, or the cross hairs of persecution.\n'Far from being terrorists, they are often the victims of terrorism themselves', she wrote.\nAngelina Jolie, the special envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, penned an emotional op-ed about the refugee crisis for The New York Times\nJolie's essay was in response to President Donald Trump's immigration ban last week\nThe 41-year-old spoke out against Trump's controversial order, writing that the United State's response to the refugee crisis should be 'based on facts, not fear'.\n'It is simply not true that our borders are overrun or that refugees are admitted to the United States without close scrutiny.\n'Refugees are in fact subject to the highest level of screening of any category of traveler to the United States.\n'This includes months of interviews, and security checks carried out by the F.B.I., the National Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department', Jolie wrote.\nJolie is the special envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\nShe has worked with the agency since 2001 and has carried out more than 50 missions for them.\nThe Oscar-winning actress has devoted massive amounts of time and money to helping refugees since she witnessed the atrocities in Cambodia while filming Tomb Raider in 2001.\nJolie wrote that she is proud to live in a country that has a history of lending its support and resources to refugees.\nJolie is the special envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, a post she has held since being promoted in 2012\nJolie adopted three of her and Brad Pitt's six children from Cambodia, Ethiopia and Vietnam\n'Americans have shed blood to defend the idea that human rights transcend culture, geography, ethnicity and religion.\n'The decision to suspend the resettlement of refugees to the United States and deny entry to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries has been met with shock by our friends around the world precisely because of this record.'\nWhile the safety of the US amid threats of terrorism should be a priority, Trump's executive order is not the solution.\nThe cause is especially close to Jolie's heart.\n'As the mother of six children, who were all born in foreign lands and are proud American citizens, I very much want our country to be safe for them, and all our nationâ€™s children.\n'But I also want to know that refugee children who qualify for asylum will always have a chance to plead their case to a compassionate America. And that we can manage our security without writing off citizens of entire countries - even babies - as unsafe to visit our country by virtue of geography or religion'.\nJolie adopted three of her six children from Cambodia, Ethiopia and Vietnam.\nHer father, actor Jon Voight, was a vocal Trump supporter throughout his presidential campaign.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-03T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:05:21.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
