Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger did a really bad job as Governor of California and even worse on the Apprentice…but at least he tried hard! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017 \nSchwarzenegger, the former Republican governor of California, took over as host of the NBC show when Trump decided to launch a campaign for president. But, apparently, Trump has been paying attention to the ratings since he left. \nDuring his address at the National Prayer Breakfast Thursday, the president had this to say : “They hired a big, big movie star to take my place — Arnold Schwarzenegger. And we know how that turned out. The ratings went right down the tubes. It’s been a total disaster.” \nTrump went on to jokingly ask the audience to “pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings.” \n“Celebrity Apprentice,” with Schwarzenegger as the host, debuted Jan. 2 with 4.95 million viewers, according to Vox . By comparison, Trump brought in 6.31 million viewers at the debut of his final season as host on Jan. 4, 2015. \nResponding to Trump’s joke, Schwarzenegger, who supported Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich for president, suggested the two men “ switch jobs .” \n“You take over TV because you’re such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job and then people can finally sleep comfortably again,” he said in a video he posted to Facebook. \nOf course, Schwarzenegger is ineligible for the presidency because he is not a “natural-born citizen” of the U.S. He was born to non-American parents in Austria.
