Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP \nScores of Londoners are unable to withdraw cash or use their bank card after a nationwide Barclays computer crash. \nPeople across the city have reported their bank cards being declined in shops and restaurants while some branches have been forced to shut early. \nBarclays banks in Ealing and Feltham reportedly closed early on Saturday afternoon as customers complained their day had been “messed up” by the technical problems. \nStaff at the Ealing branch put up a sign which read: “Due to unforeseen circumstances our computer systems have crashed and we are unable to complete transactions. \n“We apologise for the inconvenience. This is a national issue.” \nDerek Jones-Bennett, who lives in Tooting, had his card declined when he tried to pay for a meal out with friends. \nHe told the Standard: “Basically I have no access to any money. \n“I went to pay for lunch, I was treating some friends and my card kept getting declined. \n\"It just kept getting declined. I thought this was really odd so I logged onto my online banking and I saw I had money. \n\"I had to leave the place to get cash but it kept saying I had insufficient funds when I knew I don't.\" \nHe added: \"I'm stranded.\" \nAaron Linstead said on Twitter: “The one day I want to do shopping Barclays goes down and can’t use your card anywhere. Just my luck!” — Annie McCall (@Temwelove) February 25, 2017 Barclays better fix this real quick I can't buy anything ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T17:47:28.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
