MUMBAI: A 21-year-old woman was molested by a home guard deployed for women's safety in the ladies' compartment of a Borivali-bound local train early on Wednesday morning. The incident is a blot on the Railways' attempts to increase the presence of uniformed officers in ladies' coaches to keep miscreants away. A complaint against the home guard, Mewlal Chandresh Chavvan, 30, was registered by the woman with the Government Railway Police (GRP) in Borivali under section 354 (sexual assault) of the Indian Penal Code. He was put before the court and granted bail on a security deposit of Rs 15,000. The incident took place at 4:42 am on a Borivali-bound train from Vile Parle station. The woman, who lived in a Juhu hostel while studying in a college nearby, hailed from Silvassa in Daman and Diu. She had intended to alight at Borivali, from where she would board a longdistance train to Silvassa. She was traveling in the second-class ladies' compartment, when she fell asleep. The woman, in her complaint to the GRP, said, \"He was sitting in one corner of the compartment and there were few other passengers in the train when I boarded. I woke up to someone touching me, just as the train had reached Malad. Startled to find him sitting next to me and touching me, I raised an objection to his advances.\" The home guard countered that he was only trying to wake the woman up. However, a police officer from Borivali GRP said, \"The train had not reached Borivali and there were still a couple of stations to pass. Also, he could have woken her up by whistling or calling out to her instead of touching her. This makes his conduct suspicious.\" The woman then dragged the home guard to the GRP police station at Borivali where a complaint was registered. The GRP have also reported the matter to the home guard.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T10:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:46:39.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
