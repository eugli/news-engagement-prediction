Watch | Super Bowl LI: Lady Gaga's epic halftime show jump 00:59 \nA s many speculated about whether the outspoken singer would use her spotlight to address issues such as immigration , Gaga recited part of the American Pledge of Allegiance, \"one nation, indivisible with liberty and justice for all,\" in her opening song. \nShe then swung down from the roof to a stage suspended on cables and embarked on a meticulously choreographed 13-minute set of her greatest hits during the National Football League championship game between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons. What was her setlist? \nA fter opening with Woody Guthrie's civil rights anthem This Land Is Your Land, Gaga continued with hits from her back catalogue. \nBallad Edge of Glory was up next, followed by 2009 dance hit Poker Face. \nGaga continued to prod at the Trump administration with a performance of Born This Way, her anthem for self-confidence and inclusion, while dressed in a silver sequined bodysuit and matching heeled boots as she performed aerial acrobatics while suspended in the air. \nShe followed this with Telephone and Just Dance, another two floor-fillers from her early career, before swinging back to Million Reasons, taken from her latest album Joanne, and rounding off the set with Bad Romance. Lady Gaga performs Bad Romance \nG aga descended onto the stage to dance through Telephone and Just Dance before running through the crowd to a piano, where she sang, Million Reasons, giving a shout-out to her parents while she performed. \nShe commanded a large troupe of dancers and musicians, props that breathed fire and audience members swinging lights in synchronisation ‚Äì the usual excess that has become a Super Bowl clich√©. Lady Gaga sings Million Reasons \nA finale of Bad Romance proved a crowdpleaser. Gaga, who had spent much of the evening in a metallic space suit, emerged in her third outfit of the performance, a midriff baring costume topped off by football-like shoulder pads. \nAfter joining her diverse cadre of dancers, the singer, known for her flair for the dramatic, ended her set by dropping her microphone, catching a football and jumping off a set of stairs onto the field. Did she cause any controversy? Lady Gaga jumps with a football \nT his year's Super Bowl followed a fierce presidential election campaign which Mr Trump won in November but which left the country at least as fractured afterwards as before it began. \nMr Trump was greeted with massive protests just after taking office on Jan 20, and his policy moves have sparked further protests and controversy in the first weeks of his presidency. From Poker Face to Super Bowl: Lady Gagas career in pictures \nA head of her high-profile performance, watched by more than 100 million US viewers, Gaga, 30, said in a post on the Instagram social media network that she planned to headline the slot entirely on her own, eschewing a tradition of halftime main acts bringing on special guests. \nT he Super Bowl halftime show, with an audience usually topping 100 million, is easily the biggest show of an artist's career. \nIt's so attention-getting that Las Vegas even set odds on what color Gaga's hair would be.
