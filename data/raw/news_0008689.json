Douglass, who died in 1895, was one of the country's most influential and celebrated African-Americans.\nDouglass was born a slave, and became an orator and a leading figure in the anti-slavery movement. Over the last 20 years of his life, Douglass served as marshal and recorder of deeds for the District of Columbia, as well as U.S. minister to Haiti. Black History Month originally started out as a weeklong celebration that included Douglass' birthday along with that of President Abraham Lincoln.\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer later said it would become clearer what Trump meant by having noticed Douglass being recognized \"more and more.\"\n\"I think he wants to highlight the contributions he has made,\" Spicer said.\nThe White House has said Trump plans to issue an official proclamation recognizing Black History Month, which has been recognized by every U.S. president since 1976. Other White House events are planned, including a gala and receptions, officials said.\n\"During this month, we honor the tremendous history of the African-Americans throughout our country, throughout the world if you really think about it, right?\" Trump said. \"And this story's one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work and faith in America.\"\n\"Martin Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks and \"millions more black Americans who made America what it is today,\" Trump said. \"I'm proud to honor this heritage and will be honoring it more and more.\"\nTrump mentioned the new Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture as a place \"where people can learn about Rev. King, so many other things.\" He did not mention the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial, which also sits on the National Mall.\nOn hand for the listening session were Housing and Urban Development Secretary nominee Ben Carson; Paris Dennard, an official with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund; longtime Republican strategist and media owner Armstrong Williams; and White House adviser Omarosa Manigault.\nTrump also said that he did better in the African-American community in his election than candidates in previous years. Among African-Americans, Trump got 8 percent of the vote, slightly better than Republican Mitt Romney's 6 percent against then-President Barack Obama in 2012, according to national exit polls.\nTrump's black support was not as high as the 12 percent that Republican Bob Dole won in 1996. Ronald Reagan set the high mark for Republicans in recent history, winning 14 percent of the black vote when he was elected president in 1980.\n___\nJesse J.
