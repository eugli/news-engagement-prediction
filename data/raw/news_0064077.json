That’s showing disdain. He came up behind her, it was the touch on the shoulder and the shoulder shrugging to dismiss him.” \nNow, let’s take a look at the Internet’s response… \nFirst, there were the tweets… PRAYER WARRIOR ALERT: Melania Trump is now even using the Lord’s words to send coded messages for help! #FreeMelania pic.twitter.com/7HRf3ob5kn \n— Mrs. Betty Bowers (@BettyBowers) February 21, 2017 @TheDweck It's a warning squeeze.
