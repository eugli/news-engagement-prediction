A Gift for the Mailman: What the Rule Book Says \nThe Code of Federal Regulations Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, Part 2635, Subpart B states: \nFederal employees cannot accept a gift as a result of their federal employment. \nWhat this means exactly is that a postal worker can't actually accept a gift from you just because he or she delivers your mail, but can only accept a gift if a personal relationship already exists between you two. \nIf you decide to ignore the rule, any gifts exceeding the $20 limit or for gifts where a value of the item can not be easily determined, your mailman must reimburse you for the cost of the item — this is done in two ways: By returning the gift or by sending financial reimbursement. \nThe second option means that if you were to give your mailman a bouquet of flowers exceeding $20, your mailman would then have to figure out the actual value and send you a reimbursement for the full value. Your intentions may have been sweet, but now your mailman has to make an extra effort to find the actual cost of your gift and then pay you the full amount of what the flowers cost out of their own pocket — that doesn't seem like much of a gift does it? Acceptable Gifts for the Mailman \nSome acceptable gifts for your mail delivery person include: modest refreshments such as coffee, doughnuts, cookies or soda; plaques, trophies and other items intended for presentation; perishable items such as food, candy, fruit or flowers so long as they are to be shared with other postal workers; and retail gifts cards with a value of less than $20 that cannot be converted to cash. Unacceptable Gifts for the Mailman \nPostal workers are prohibited from accepted the following items: cash", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:18:02.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
