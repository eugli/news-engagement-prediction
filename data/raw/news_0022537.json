How about revelling in some self-love this time? So pick up your backpack and head out to these places to collect some exclusive memories. \n\nAuroville \nAs the destination itself claims, Auroville is a ''universal town where here men and women of all countries are able to live in peace and progressive harmony.'' And undoubtedly so, as the city has evolved as one the safest destinations in the country. Spreading itself over the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, this ideal township has much more than what meets the eye at first glance. A cultural day tour and some lone time on the Auroville beach are highly recommended. Do visit the Matrimandir viewing point at the city's central Peace area.
