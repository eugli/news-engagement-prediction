Theoretical physicist Robert McNees tweeted, “Good grief, I couldn’t believe how spot-on that Carl Sagan quote was. I had to check to make sure it was accurate.” Good grief, I couldn't believe how spot-on that Carl Sagan quote was. I had to check to make sure it was accurate. https://t.co/WrrXg4pTKe pic.twitter.com/GXMVyeD6jY — Robert McNees (@mcnees) January 23, 2017 \nWhile it’s great that major scientists like Sagan, Neil deGrasse Tyson , and Bill Nye are treated like celebrities nowadays, it’s also vital to remember that these men can be wrong and sometimes their high profile ends up being detrimental to actual progress . People should probably take what these scientists say or tweet with a grain of salt. \nDan Seitz at Uproxx observes that doomsayers tend to be wrong (looking at you, ancient Mayans who said we’d all be gone in 2012). Predicting a bleak future isn’t anything revolutionary. Somebody’s always going to be pessimistic about what’s next — that doesn’t necessarily mean that we should all lay down and let it take over. \nSagan’s prediction holds some legitimacy, but parts of it can also be debunked. Yes, China beats out the United States when it comes to manufacturing. But the United States is still the second most competitive manufacturing economy . Also, “awesome technological powers” aren’t in the hands of “a very few.” According to a 2015 Pew Research Center report, 64 percent of Americans own a smartphone of some kind. And the approximately 470,000 people in the women’s march just in Washington, D.C. will probably contest that they know how to “knowledgeably question those in authority.” \nThen there are those that are genuinely intrigued by Sagan’s prediction and are questioning whether or not he’s actually a time traveler. @neiltyson , where are you hiding Carl Sagan's time machine!?!?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T11:28:47.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
