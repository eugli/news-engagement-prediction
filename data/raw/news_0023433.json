Canby Jr., an appointee of former President Jimmy Carter, pressed Flentje on whether any American had standing to challenge Trump if he decided to go through with the Muslim ban that he proposed as a presidential candidate.\n\"Could the president simply say in the order, we're not going to let any Muslims in?\" Canby asked.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

This order is limited to the countries defined by Congress.\"\nJudge Michelle T. Friedland, an appointee of former President Barack Obama , noted that opposing counsel for the state of Washington had submitted evidence that they believed showed banning Muslims was a motivating factor for Trump.\n\"Why shouldn't the case proceed, perhaps to discovery, to see if that really was the motivation or not?\" Friedland asked.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Cruz, Sanders trade jabs over healthcare rationing \nBernie Sanders and Ted Cruz traded barbs over whether a single payer government healthcare system will lead to a rationing of healthcare.\nCruz said during a CNN debate Tuesday that a move to a single payer, government-run system will lead to longer wait times and rationing of care to the population. He pointed to wait times of more than 90 days for a hip replacement in the United Kingdom in 2013, one of the countries that has a single payer system.\n\"Whenever you put government in charge of healthcare what it means is that they ration who gets care and when you don't,\" the Texas senator and former presidential candidate said.\nHis opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., countered that there is already rationing of care in\nBy Robert King • 02/07/17 9:55 PM \"We're not saying the case shouldn't proceed,\" Flentje answered.\n\"But it is extraordinary for a court to enjoin the president's national security determination based on some newspaper articles and that's what has happened here. That is very troubling second-guessing of the national security decision made by the president.\"\nJudge Richard R. Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush, then raised the issue of Trump's statements on the presidential campaign trail regarding a ban on Muslims.\nIn December 2015, Trump called for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\"\nNew York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Trump adviser, said Trump later asked him to put together a task force that could develop a legal way to implement Trump's desired ban. The guidance Giuliani offered pre-dated Trump's order banning migration from select predominantly Muslim countries.\nFlentje acknowledged that Trump and other advisers spoke previously about a Muslim ban, but noted that the lower court judge issuing the restraining order blocking the ban said that the judge would not look at campaign statements made by Trump. Clifton said that the lower court judge was making a different point, and Clifton was simply trying to determine the statements that could be construed as potential evidence for an argument.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:07:34.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
