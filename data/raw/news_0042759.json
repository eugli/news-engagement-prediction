Omar Kelly is rare because of all the moving parts. But the Dolphins found a way to do two separate deals with the Jacksonville Jaguars that benefited both teams.\nInstead of a player-for-player swap, which had been discussed, the Dolphins sent left tackle Branden Albert to Jacksonville in exchange for a late-round pick in 2018, and Miami got tight end Julius Thomas from the Jaguars for a late-round pick in 2017, according to sources. \nThomas will be visiting the Dolphins on Tuesday to take a physical and meet with team officials. \nIt is unclear whether the contracts for Albert and Thomas have been restructured. However, Albert said his deal is being redone. \nThe trades can’t become official until the start of the new league year on March 9, and plenty of hurdles could surface until then. \nA initial, tentative deal for Thomas fell apart earlier Monday. According to a source, the sticking point was the Dolphins’ desire for the 6-foot-5 tight end to restructure what remains on the five-year, $46 million contract he signed with the Jaguars in 2014.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) ( ) \nThomas is guaranteed $3 million of his $7.1 million salary for this upcoming season, which includes a $100,000 workout bonus. He’s slated to make $8.6 million in 2018 and $9 million in 2019, and the Dolphins wanted to rework those numbers. \nTalks stalled, Thomas was taken out of the Albert trade, and reports of other teams making an offer for Thomas surfaced. By Monday afternoon a new deal was agreed upon. \nThomas, who turns 29 in June, thrived while playing for Dolphins coach Adam Gase in 2013 and 2014, when Gase was the Denver Broncos ’ offensive coordinator. \nAdding Thomas would provide Miami’s offense a seam threat it lacked last season. Thomas caught 30 passes for 281 yards and four touchdowns in the nine games he played in 2016. \nIn 2013 and 2014, he was considered one of the NFL’s top up-and-coming tight ends after catching 108 passes for 1,277 yards and scoring 24 touchdowns over those two seasons with the Broncos. \nHowever, he’s played 21 games for the Jaguars, starting just 16 the past two seasons because of various injuries. He was placed on injured reserve late last season because of a back injury. Thomas will need to pass his physical to finalize the trade. \nThe Dolphins will clear $7.2 million in salary cap space once Albert’s trade to Jacksonville is completed, but Thomas will cost $7.1 million if his deal isn’t reworked.

Miami hopes to get younger on the offensive line. \nThomas’ expected addition means it won’t be a priority for the Dolphins to re-sign free-agent tight ends Jordan Cameron or Dion Sims, unless the price is favorable to the team. \nThe Dolphins are expected to aggressively pursue linebackers, defensive linemen and offensive linemen in free agency and the draft.
