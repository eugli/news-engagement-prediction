By Kyle Mizokami Feb 9, 2017 The U.S. Air Force has sent four heavy, four-engine bombers nearly a third of the way around the world from their base in Texas to the island of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. The mission is part of an effort to deter North Korea with regular, visible displays of heavy weapons and firepower. Crank up the volume and listen to the combined roar of four GE 101-102 afterburning turbofan engines on takeoff.   Most Popular The four B-1B bombers of the 9th Bomb Squadron (\" The Bats \") departed Dyess Air Force Base in Texas and flew to the island of Guam, a distance of 7,120 miles. The mission is part of the Continuous Bomber Presence program, which rotates heavy bombers from the Air Force's Global Strike Command to the island on a regular basis. The program began in 2004 as a means of reassuring American allies in the region and warning potential enemies. The service has rotated B-1, B-2, and B-52 bombers to Andersen Air Force Base, the sprawling air base on the Pacific island. Bombers stationed on Guam conduct live fire missions on the island of Farallon de Medinilla , a small, uninhabited island 45 miles north of Saipan. Bomb craters are easily visible on Google Maps' view of the island here . Here's a video of a Continuous Bomber Presence B-52 bombing the island here: More from Popular Mechanics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:35:10.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
