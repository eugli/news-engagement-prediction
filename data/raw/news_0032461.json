A 21-year-old man, accused of sexually abusing a girl, 8, and then threatening to kill her if she informed anyone about it, had his 6-month-jail term increased to one year by the Court of Appeals on Wednesday.The Pakistani man, who is a site supervisor, was found guilty by the Court of First Instance last November of groping the little girl and kissing her on the cheek and neck, and threatening to kill her.He earlier pleaded not guilty to charges of molestation and making criminal threats.He claimed he was younger than what is shown on his passport.However, the court convicted him then, sentenced him to six months in jail and ordered his deportation.That verdict was later appealed by both the defendant and the public prosecution. It was on Wednesday revoked by the appellate court, which sentenced him to one year in jail and upheld his deportation order.The incident, as shown in the prosecution records, took place on August 29 last year.The girl, from India, said that the man on trial asked her and her little brother to play hide and seek in the playground outside the building where they stayed in Al Rafaa.\"When my brother hid, that man asked me to sit on the stairs. He then came close to me.\"The girl recounted to the investigator how the man touched her, kissed her and bit her neck.She became very upset and slapped him and before she left he threatened to kill her if she ever informed anybody about what he did.The girl's father, a 40-year-old accountant, said that he was at his place around 11 pm when he heard his daughter crying in her room: \"She looked afraid of something. She told me what happened and how she was threatened.\"The forensic report showed a mark that looked like a bruise on the girl's neck which could be left by a kiss.The worker may challenge the ruling within 30 days. mary@khaleejtimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T16:30:50.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
