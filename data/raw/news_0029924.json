This picture taken on February 11, 2017 shows fishermen looking at pilot whales which died in a mass stranding at Farewell Spit. (AFP Photo) \n“The area is currently closed to the public because of the risk from whales exploding,” the conservation department said in a statement. \nWorkers in protective clothing would spend the day cutting holes in the whale carcasses, “like popping balloons” with knives and two metre (six feet) needles, to release internal gases that build up pressure, a DOC spokesman told local radio.

(REUTERS) \nThe surviving whales were last seen swimming six kms (four miles) offshore on Sunday evening, according to DOC. \nLast Thursday a pod of about 400 whales became stranded , with a second pod of more than 200 whales stranded on Saturday. \nThe precise cause of the whale strandings was not known.

Its shallow muddy waters confuse the whale’s sonar, leaving it vulnerable to stranding by an ebb tide, according to marine environmental organisation Project Jonah.

About three-quarters of the pilot whales were already dead when they were found Friday morning at Farewell Spit at the tip of the South Island.
