By Hollee Actman Becker Comments \nTinseltown/Shutterstock Confession time: I didn't stay up long enough last night to witness the biggest mishap in Oscar historyâ€”now known as \"Envelopegate.\" Why? Because it took place at about 10 minutes after midnight and my kids wake up at the crack of dawn, that's why. And yes, I was pretty bummed to have missed it when I heard all about it this morning. But I did get to see the red carpet arrivals about five hours before at the totally reasonable 7 o'clock hour, and that's usually the best part anyway. So at least there's that. RELATED: Mom Brain: That Moment Your Kid Was an A-hole \nMy fave couple to hit the carpet this year was Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel. Hands DOWN. I mean, JT can do no wrong in my eyes ever. And while I've never been a huge fan of the Mrs. (color me insanely jealous), even I had to admit she looked resplendent in her stunning gold Kaufman Franco. Or as Timberlake told Ryan Seacrest during the E! pre-show . \"I call it perfection, baby!\" \n#MadHusbandGoals A post shared by Jessica Biel (@jessicabiel) on Feb 26, 2017 at 10:55pm PST \nTimberlake also got candid about the reality of parenting 22-month-old son Silas , revealing on the carpet that while raising his mini-me is amazing, his little one happens to be going through a fairly difficult stage right now. \n\"He does not want the diapers changed,\" Timberlake explained to Entertainment Tonight . \"He's hitting his terrible twos a little early, so we're hoping he'll get out of them a little early.\" \nGood luck with that, guys! My son is currently 11 and I'm still waiting for the terrible twos phase to end. Meanwhile, Biel also chimed in, and got even MORE real when she perfectly summed up the parenting struggle with the following spot-on sentence: \n\"He's doing amazing,\" she said of Silas. \"But it's one of those things where you're like, I love you, but I don't know if I like you.\" Have a toddler at home?
