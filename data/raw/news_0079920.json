After being rejected, a motion to allow the broadcast by all media outlets was later unanimously approved by the committee.\nThe committee got an earful about how bad things are in the classroom.\nWhat gets broadcast now? While proceedings in the legislative chamber are broadcast online and on cable using Legislative TV, Province House's in-house production service , it's not available in the Red Chamber where law amendments takes place or for committee meetings held across the street in One Government Place.\nMLAs from all three parties agree it's time to allow greater access to those proceedings.\nProgressive Conservative House leader Chris d'Entremont said if what happens at Province House is to truly be a public forum, it needs to be open and accessible to as many people as possible — not just those who can be physically present in downtown Halifax.\nMobile streaming in demand \"I think today, access on a cellphone walking down the road seems to be where people are,\" he said.\n\"We're always restricted on how many people can actually come and participate and see what actually happens. So the more opportunity that we have to provide that to them, I think we should modernize our rules to make sure that happens.\"\nNDP House leader Dave Wilson also supports a more digitally-accessible House.\nGetting more people engaged He hopes that improved access might also increase the level of public engagement.\n\"When people know what's happening in this legislature, I think they'll become more aware of what they can do to influence policy decisions of a government, legislation that happens here on the floor of the legislature and, hopefully, motivate them to be engaged during elections,\" said Wilson.\nExpanding services, be it through Legislative TV or another means, would require input from a number of players, including the House's assembly management commission and assembly matters committee.\nHow things might look Government House leader Michel Samson, who sits on both committees, said better access should be discussed, but how it would look needs to be determined. With Legislative TV, he noted, no one is shown on camera unless they are speaking, a custom from which the media live streams departed.\n\"I'd certainly want to be able to hear from our experts over at Legislative TV and all others as to both the pros and the cons of how it worked [with Bill 75] and what might be the options for the future,\" he said.\nThe government typically holds law amendments meetings on Mondays in an effort to help people with scheduling, but Samson said the Liberals remain open to further changes.", "external_links": ["http://nslegislature.ca/index.php/proceedings/legislative-tv/"], "published": "2017-02-27T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:32:13.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
