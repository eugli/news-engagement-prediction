At the 2015 general election, Mr Reed secured 42 per cent of the vote compared to 35 per cent for the Conservatives.\nAs the results were counted in the early hours of Friday morning, senior Labour sources appeared to be conceding defeat, adding it was “neck and neck” and that “rural constituencies still to come in likely to favour Tories”.\nOn Thursday evening Mr Corbyn thanked those who campaigned for the party in the final hours and braved Storm Doris , which lashed parts of Britain with up to 94mph gusts.\nHe added: “The political establishment has let down Copeland and Stoke, who have seen their industries gutted, living standards stagnate and hope for a better future for their children and grandchildren decline.\n“Whatever the results, the Labour Party - and our mass membership - must go further to break the failed political consensus, and win power to rebuild and transform Britain.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:39:31.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
