He has an impressive record on several issues. But some of his statements on federalism and judicial review are seriously troubling. \nIn legal circles, Gorsuch is probably best known for his skepticism toward the so-called Chevron doctrine, a 1984 Supreme Court decision requiring federal judges to defer to administrative agencies' interpretations of the law in cases where the text seems ambiguous. On this, Gorsuch is absolutely right. Judges, not bureaucrats, should take the lead in interpreting the law. Paring back bureaucratic discretion in this way would reduce the often-overweening power of bureaucrats and force them to adhere to the rule of law. \nJudge Gorsuch also deserves praise for his rulings emphasizing that criminal law should be interpreted narrowly, and ambiguities resolved in favor of defendants. In an age where the scope of federal law has grown extraordinarily broad and almost anyone might inadvertently run afoul of it, it is more important than ever that we enforce the traditional legal principle that no one should be subject to punishment unless the law clearly and unequivocally forbids what they did.

In a 2005 article, he suggested that judges should only strike down laws in \"extraordinary\" circumstances. This implies that merely \"ordinary\" or potentially contestable violations of the Constitution may be overlooked — an unfortunate attitude at a time when the overweening power of government in general and the presidency in particular threatens the Constitution on many fronts. \nPresident Trump nominates Neil Gorsuch to Supreme Court \nIn the same article, Gorsuch praised New Deal-era liberals' \"judicial restraint and deference to the right of Congress to experiment with economic and social policy.\" He urged modern liberals to \"return to their New Deal roots,\" as exemplified by \"their own judges of the New Deal era.\" Liberal jurists of that period advocated near-total abdication of judicial enforcement of limits on federal power. Their position was badly misguided, and utterly at odds with the originalist approach to constitutional interpretation that Gorsuch himself has advocated elsewhere. \nGorsuch's possible commitment to New Deal-liberal positions on federalism might win him some sympathy on the left. But perhaps not at a time when liberals are relying on federalism principles to, among other things, resist Donald Trump's efforts to bully sanctuary cities into submission. More generally, left and right alike need strong judicial enforcement of federalism to help reduce the dangers of political polarization and save the failing \"marriage\" between red and blue states.

But, given the high stakes, we should — at least for the moment — take his writings both seriously and literally. \nJudge Gorsuch does not have much of a record on freedom of speech and constitutional property rights, two other areas where Donald Trump's past history and ominous statements suggest serious threats to our constitutional liberties. That certainly does not mean he necessarily supports Trump's dangerous positions in these fields. But, as with federalism, the Senate should closely scrutinize Gorsuch's views on these questions. President Donald Trump announced his pick for SCOTUS Tuesday. (Evan Vucci/AP) \nNeil Gorsuch may well turn out to be a surprisingly worthy nominee from a President who has so far shown precious little respect for the Constitution. But in these dangerous times for our constitutional system, neither the Senate nor the American people should take anything for granted. \nIlya Somin is a law professor at George Mason University and author of \"Democracy and Political Ignorance: Why Smaller Government is Smarter.\" Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:50:58.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
