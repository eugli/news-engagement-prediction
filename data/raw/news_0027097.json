'I know some Greek economists who have even gone to leading think tanks in the US to discuss this topic and the question of dollarization,' he told Skai TV , according to the Express. 'Such a topic of course freaks out the Germans because they really don't want to hear such ideas.' It comes just four days after one of the EU’s most powerful finance chiefs warned Greece will be forced out of the Eurozone if it fails to address its ailing finances. Amid growing concern about the outbreak of another European economy crisis, German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said calls to slash the country’s debt mountain would lead to Grexit. Greece leaving EU will be a blow to Merkel The blunt assessment by Angela Merkel’s finance chief follows a damning report by the International Monetary Fund that claimed Greece’s fragile economy would soon become ‘explosive’. In a move that is threatening to destroy the current bailout package, the Washington-based body called for Europe to send even more money to cut Greece’s ‘highly unsustainable’ debt. The war of words about how to avoid another crisis and assist the Greek economy intensified yesterday as officials desperately tried to reach agreement. But Mr Schaeuble rubbished the IMF’s call for the EU to inject more money into Greek coffers and said that Germany had no intention of providing a ‘debt haircut’. ‘For that, Greece would have to exit the currency area,’ he said. ‘Pressure on Greece to undertake reforms must be maintained so that it becomes competitive, otherwise they can’t remain.’ The possibility of providing yet more publically-funded debt relief to Greece is seen as a politically toxic idea in Germany just months before Miss Merkel vies for re-election. The stalemate between the EU and the IMF may stall a crucial £6billion repayment owed by Greece in July for which they require another bailout payment The European Union has insisted Greece's economy is on track despite an IMF warning over the country's 'explosive' debt that could threaten the future of the Eurozone. German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble during his meeting with the Greek Prime Minister in Athens in 2013 A standoff between the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund has dragged on for months, raising fears of a new debt crisis and sparking fresh talk of Greece tumbling out of the euro. Talking of the Greek crisis, Prof Malloch said: 'Greece might have to sever ties and do Grexit and exit the euro. It needs debt restructuring, it really needs debt relief, and I know people in Europe don't want to hear that. 'They need to reduce the debt overhanging and that means frankly something that people in Germany and elsewhere have not been able to accept, it means a haircut to the lenders and to the banks in Germany and probably, at least in my perspective, a return to the drachma. 'So the problem then is who will manage that transition, and how, to avoid all the chaos and all the instability.'
