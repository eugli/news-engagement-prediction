However, for many people, inflammation goes haywire, and they end up constantly battling a storm of chronic, low-grade inflammation. \nThis hyper-inflammation is the underlying commonality between just about every health problem we see today. Brain fog , depression, anxiety, thyroid problems, autoimmune conditions, digestive issues, cancer, heart disease, and arthritis all are somewhere on the inflammation spectrum. \nGetting your inflammation levels balanced is essential for you to thrive. The problem is, many people can get overwhelmed and not know where to start. \nIf you were waiting for the right time, it's now. You can start bringing your inflammation levels down and balancing your immune system today. \nMy job as a functional medicine doctor is to get to the root cause of health problems but also come up with practical, sustainable solutions to address them. Here's my simple one-day plan to get you started: 1. Start your day with a cup of coffee. \nFor all you coffee lovers out there, this is an easy one! It may be a shock to hear that coffee is encouraged, but coffee drinkers were shown to have lower CRP (an inflammatory protein) levels so start off this one-day diet with a nice big cup of joe. Make sure what you are drinking is organic and third-party tested for mold. If you can't tolerate coffee, green tea has also been shown to lower CRP . Photo: Stocksy 2. Decrease NF-kB. \nDid I tell you this is not your mother's anti-inflammatory plan? We are getting scientific here, my friend. High levels of the inflammatory nuclear factor kappa B, or NF-kB, will not do you any favors when trying to balance inflammation levels. When NF-kB is activated it binds to your DNA and brings about various inflammatory cascades in the body and has been shown to play a role in many chronic inflammatory conditions . Start decreasing this by snacking on NF-kB-fighting super foods throughout your day such as blueberries and matcha green tea. 3. Increase your Nrf-2. \nThe protein Nrf-2 turns on genes that are responsible for antioxidant and detox pathways. This in turn helps calm inflammation levels. Activate Nrf-2 by focusing on dietary antioxidant foods such as matcha green tea. Not only will green tea increase Nrf-2, but it is pulling double duty decreasing the inflammatory NF-kB as well. 4. Maximize your fat-soluble vitamins. \nThe vitamins A , D, E , and K2 are extremely important to your health for many reasons. They play a big factor in bringing down inflammation by decreasing levels of the inflammatory protein CRP. Focus on food medicines that are high in these vitamins by following my food plan below. 5. Avoid alcoholâ€”except for one kind. \nMake sure to limit the alcohol (or cut it out entirely!). It can actually increase your levels of CRP . However, studies have shown that red wine when consumed in small amounts is associated with lower CRP . So if you choose, end your day with a nice glass of your favorite organic red wine before heading to bed! 6. Boost methylation. \nMethylation is your body's biochemical superhighway that helps protect your DNA, brain, and gut from inflammation. It is important to support healthy methylation pathways to lower homocysteine, an inflammatory amino acid. A great way to help with this is by eating sulfur-rich vegetables such as cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli. 7. Reduce stress and increase mindfulness. \nStress can hurt your health in more ways than one , including raising CRP. People with stressful jobs or toxic relationships have been shown in many studies to have higher CRP levels . Mindfulness meditation is a great technique to help lower stress and also bring down CRP . Incorporate mindfulness at some point either in the morning before you start your busy day, during lunch, or even in the evening to close out the day. Your One-Day Inflammation-Calming Diet \nNow let's take these inflammation-busting tips and maximize them for your day. This plan will focus on calming inflammation in all its forms: CRP, NF-kB, and homocysteine. In addition, your anti-inflammatory methylation and NRF-2 pathways will be activated. Win-win!
