Most Popular By Scott Christian Feb 23, 2017 Easily one of the most iconic sneakers of all time is the original \"banned\" Air Jordan 1 . As the story goes, Michael Jordan was told by the NBA that he'd be fined $5,000 if he wore them, since they didn't meet uniform specifications. He wore them anyway, and a legend was born. And now, that legend, as well as the original shoes that started it, are being used to protest one of the more destructive (and ludicrous) policies of the month-old Trump administration. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Victor Nguyen-Long, a former employee of Nike, is selling his pair of original 1985 Air Jordan 1s on eBay. And rather than spending the money from the sale on himself, he'll be donating the proceeds to various charities in order to protest Donald Trump and his Muslim ban. Most Popular \"Everybody is just very engaged with politics right now and everything that's going on in the country,\" Nguyen-Long told sneaker website Sole Collector . \"People are all clamoring to figure out a way to contribute or do something.\" Nguyen-Long originally got the shoes from his mother's college roommate. He was visiting her with his family in 2013 when she mentioned that she had an old pair of Nike basketball shoes lying around that she'd bought for her son when he was in high school. They turned out to be original Air Jordan 1s. She mailed them to Nguyen-Long a year later, and he's had them ever since. Once sold, he plans to split up the proceeds from the sale of the shoes between the family friend, the ACLU, Misericordia University—where his mother and her former roommate met—and Boat People SOS , a non-profit founded by his mother, who also happens to be an immigrant. Nguyen-Long told Sole Collector that he's happy that brands like Nike and Adidas are stepping up to speak out against Trump and his controversial policies, but thinks there's always room to do more. \"Every business in America, no matter where it is—whether it's in the Rust Belt, or the middle of America, or in the coastal cities—has had immigrants, and immigrants to thank for part of their success.\" If you'd like to get your hands on these OG Jordans, not to mention help lend a hand in the fight against Donald Trump's insanity, head on over to eBay and place your bid. Right now it's up to more than $1,500. Related Story ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:17:20.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
