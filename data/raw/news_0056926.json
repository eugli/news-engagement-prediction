Tube and rail strikes continue to cause commuter choas \nShe claims that, as a result, her food budget is only around £16.60 a week for her family of four. \nLorna apparently gets a £65 box from Muscle Food , an online food shop, which lasts her family for around six weeks. \nWhile the box is only made up of meat, she also orders vegetables and cupboard staples from the site. Impressive (Picture: Facebook) \nTo save even more money, however, you could get a fresh veg hamper for £10 a week for four people – which works out around £5 cheaper every six weeks than if you buy the meat one. You could then supplement your order with grains and spices. Brace yourselves! Storm Doris is going to hit with blizzards with 80mph winds \nLorna, from Blocharin in Glasgow, said: ‘I’ve always watched what I’ve spent when it comes to the grocery bill, and over the years have learnt a lot of different ways to make meals stretch further. \n‘I’ve definitely learnt that bulk-ordering wholesome and healthy ingredients instead of regular trips to the shop is a great way to prep ahead and make food last.’ \nShe also runs a Facebook page called ‘ Feed your family for about £20 a week ‘, or ‘FYF’ for short, on which she gives regular money-saving advice and recipes.
