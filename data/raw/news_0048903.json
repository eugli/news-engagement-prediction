(Photo: azcentral) \n10 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Several groups of dogs with Leptospirosis, a bacterial infection that can spread to humans, were reported in Arizona over the past year, the Arizona Department of Health Services said.\nThe disease can be transported to humans if they come in contact with an infected dog's urine or with diseased rodents and other wildlife, DHS said in an advisory posted on its website.\nIn extreme cases, Leptospirosis can lead to kidney and liver failure in both dogs and humans. No cases of human infection with the disease have been confirmed in Arizona.\nLeptospirosis was detected in several groups of infected dogs over the past year, indicating cases may be on the rise, DHS said.\nSymptoms in dogs include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, vomiting or diarrhea, but more serious conditions, including liver or kidney failure, can occur, DHS said.\nIn both humans and dogs, the disease can be treated with antibiotics. Even after treatment, however, dogs with Leptospirosis can shed the bacteria in their urine for several months.\nHumans with Leptospirosis often experience flu-like symptoms, but the symptoms can turn more serious.\nDHS offered several tips people can take for themselves and their pets to avoid contracting the disease:\n• Avoid swimming in water that may be contaminated with animal urine.\n• Don't make contact with rodents or other wildlife in order to reduce exposure to the bacteria.\n• Discuss vaccinating your dog against Leptospirosis with your veterinarian.\nFor more information, contact the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, or email vbzd@azdhs.gov .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:19:36.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
