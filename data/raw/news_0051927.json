Image Source: Twitter/Meenakshi Shedde \nThe jury, consisting of Spanish film composer Pedro Barbadillo, Croatian director and Pula Film Festival producer Tanja Milicic and French producer Rainer Wothe labelled Newton as a 'wonderful' and 'exceptional' film. \n“This exceptional film within the rich and varied Forum selection deals with the various issues of democracy and fight for it during the elections in India. It’s modular portrayal of Indian culture, the dark humour and ironic approach as well as positive use of typical cliches in Indian society gives ‘NEWTON’ a unique form and style which will delight audiences in art house cinemas all over the world,” the Jury said in a statement. Image Source: Twitter/Meenakshi Shedde The award was received by film curator Meenakshi Shedde on behalf of the director. \nRao took to Twitter to congratulate the entire team of the film. So happy to share #Newton has won the Art Cinema award for the Forum section at #Berlinale . Congratulations team @ManMundra @Amit_Masurkar — Raj Kummar Rao (@RajkummarRao) February 18, 2017 \nThere were total 43 films screened in the segment at the festival. \nFilmmaker Amit, who rose to fame after helming 2014 film Sulemani Keeda said, “Newton is the result of so many people coming together with a common intention of telling a story that was waiting to be told. I’m shocked to see how well it connected with an international audience despite the rootedness and regional nuances. We are very touched by the love showered upon us by the Berlin International Film Festival and we feel honoured to accept this award.” \nAmit had earlier said that the movie will release in mid-2017. \nThe movie revolves around the story of a rookie clerk on election duty in a conflict-ridden jungle of Central India, who tries his best to conduct free and fair voting.
