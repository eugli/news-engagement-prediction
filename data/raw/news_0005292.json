We wonder if our plans to foster or adopt will be blocked by an anti-LGBT cabinet. Our families are also immigrants, Muslim and Mexican, and we fear what's in store for us as a result of mean-spirited Executive Orders targeting these communities. \nBut for our children, our families, ourselves, and our country, we also continue to be hopeful. We want to believe that people in power will ultimately use that power for good, and that they will make future decisions that benefit all families, including LGBTQ families. \nSo while Gays With Kids will continue to monitor and report on the policies to come out of the White House, we will prioritize doing what we do best: telling our stories and sharing invaluable information to help gay men become dads and navigate fatherhood. Because one of the most radical forms of protest for LGBTQ people has always been, and will continue to be, simply living our lives proudly and out in the open. \nSo with that, please enjoy this collection of photos of LGBTQ families across the country, asking the new administration to #RememberOurFamilies when considering legislation that affects our children, our lives, our dreams, and our neighbors. \nAdd your own #LGBT family to this campaign by commenting below with your favorite family photo and family name, or upload your favorite family photo on Facebook , Instagram or Twitter with the #RememberOurFamilies hashtag. Also, please share this post far and wide and ask your friends to do the same. The greater our reach, the more likely we'll be to reach the attention of our new President. \n#RememberOurFamilies", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T16:53:15.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
