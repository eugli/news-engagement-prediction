Pine Ridge, he noted, is only about six hours away from Denver. \nIt’s also considered one of the poorest areas of the United States, where the average life span of a man on the 30,000-member reservation is only 48 years. Many of the homes there do not have running water.

Many of the dead were later piled into a mass grave, where a Catholic church was later built. \n“I’m an Italian and a Catholic so I’m not here to bash Catholics, but this is history, this is what happened,” Ventimiglia said. \n“What the Lakota Sioux didn’t do, was let their culture and music die out.” \nTribal members sang, danced and told the students their lives revolved around honoring nature and their ancestors. \nToumi Annoh, a 16-year-old junior, said he appreciated hearing the tribe’s perspective. \n“I enjoyed it. It was very touching. I’m glad we were able to experience it.” Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T14:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T09:35:22.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
