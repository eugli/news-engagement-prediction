Congress Ave. — a major step for the company to directly reach consumers, and a promising development for a long-vacant property at the gateway between downtown and trendy shopping to the south. The 8,000-square-foot space is packed with scenes from the outdoors, such as a fishing skiff and taxidermied bear, plus plenty of Austin mementos that pay homage to the hometown of founders Roy Seiders and Ryan Seiders . The brothers started the company in 2006, and over the past decade-plus have grown it into a business with 300-plus employees and annual revenue of more than $468 million. 11 photos The new Yeti Coolers store on South Congress Avenue at Barton Springs Road is set to open… more The flagship also store includes a bar, a stage, neon signs by Evan Voyles (owner of Neon Jungle, who also created neon signs for the likes of Uncommon Objects and Home Slice Pizza), a screening area to show promotional videos and coolers and other products stacked everywhere. The marquee site is a short stroll from downtown, at the corner of South Congress and Barton Springs Road, and sits next to one of the city's primary tourist attractions: bat viewing on the South Congress bridge. On top of all that it's next to the downtown hike-and-bike trail, a favorite for Yeti's target audience. Austin Business Journal reported on the store in February 2016 when rumors were abounding in the real estate community about the cool but dilapidated building. Now one of the highest-profile consumer companies in Austin has created a temple to its brand at the border between the city's commercial heart and one of its hippest residential and shopping districts. The public opening is slated for Feb. 23. Built in 1936, the facility at 220 S. Congress Ave. once housed Brink's cash handling and security business. Developers have pined over the thin block next to Lady Bird Lake: In 1999-2000, Houston developer Randall Davis had hoped to turn the site into a 10-story residential tower called the Gotham , complete with neo-Gothic architecture. But Davis ran into resistance from neighbors over the building's proposed height and look . The location was most recently a furniture store, which closed in 2009 . Austin-based Cielo Property Group purchased the site in 2015 and invested at least $2 million on a facelift with Gensler as the architect. Once Yeti got involved, it recruited Lake/Flato Architects while branding agency McGarrah Jessee led the concept design for the new space with input from retail design firm Lauckgroup. The store is part of the city's South Central Waterfront project , which aims to guide the redevelopment of a few of blocks on the south shore of Lady Bird Lake in order to create a lively, walkable district. An advisory board was recently created to oversee the process . Parent company Yeti Holdings Inc. filed in July 2016 for an IPO . However, those plans are apparently on hold — the company is reportedly seeking more private funding before it heads to the public markets .
