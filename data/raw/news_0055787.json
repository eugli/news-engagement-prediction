More than 40,000 people died there before its liberation by US troops in 1945. \nA ceremony was held on Wednesday to mark the gate's return to the site. Image copyright EPA Image caption No arrests have ever been made over the theft of the gate \nThe president of the International Dachau Committee, Jean-Michel Thomas, called for further investigations into the theft, which he described as \"deeply shocking\". \nThe perpetrators had tried to \"remove a trace, a symbol of all that is represented by the inscription 'Arbeit Macht Frei' on this gate of Dachau camp that some 210,000 detainees walked through from 1933 to 1945\", he said. \nThe gate was stolen on a Saturday night between the rounds of security guards watching the site. \nAt the time, police raised fears that the thieves could be neo-Nazis. \nThe gate will now be placed in the museum at Dachau. \nThe memorial attracts about 800,000 visitors a year. US Vice President Mike Pence visited earlier in February, accompanied by his wife and daughter.
