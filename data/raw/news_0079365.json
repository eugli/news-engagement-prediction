Bruce Rauner at a news conference in Springfield on Feb. 23, 2017. \nIllinois Gov. Bruce Rauner at a news conference in Springfield on Feb. 23, 2017. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy \nRepublican Gov. Bruce Rauner kept his distance from President Donald Trump during a weekend visit to Washington, D.C., where he participated in a gathering of governors but didn't meet with the president and skipped a White House dinner that was attended by 46 other governors. \nRauner did not attend the National Governors Association dinner with the president, a fellow Republican, even as Trump has made a habit of bashing Chicago over its persistent problems with violent crime. The governor's response to the new president's statements about Chicago has been similar to his stance during the campaign: He has often avoided the topic, even veering away from uttering the president's name. \nOn Monday, the most Rauner revealed is he's been in \"communication\" with members of the \"Trump administration\" on \"violence issues.\" \n\"The folks who are developing the policy — different from, you know, media discussion — the policy that we're actually going to implement, we're in conversations, I'm personally in conversations with folks developing that,\" Rauner told reporters Monday when asked to respond to the perception that he's been distancing himself from Trump. \nThe governor did not give specifics about what policy was being considered, nor did he say whom he was talking with from Trump's administration. Pressed on whether he was avoiding Trump, Rauner said he'd \"meet with the president any time.\" \nA longtime businessman and first-term politician like Trump, Rauner is up for re-election in 2018 in a state where the Republican president lost last year by a significant margin. That alone could make being close to Trump a politically tricky prospect. \nAdding to that, Rauner spent the campaign keeping his distance from the presidential race and Trump's candidacy. The governor, for example, skipped the Republican National Convention where Trump was nominated. But that didn't stop Democrats from running ads connecting him to Trump, and it's likely they'll consider the same playbook in the upcoming campaign.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:06:21.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
