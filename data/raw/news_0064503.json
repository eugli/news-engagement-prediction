Both pleaded not guilty.

She was jailed for four years over the scam and he has been fighting through the courts for years to get the properties back.

Pratuan did not respond to requests for comment. \nUnlike in most countries, where defamation is a civil crime, in Thailand it is a criminal offence. Private citizens can launch their own cases and they do not have to pay costs if they lose. \nBrad Adams, Human Rights Watch’s Asia director, said the case against Head and Rance showed “exactly why having criminal defamation laws is such a bad idea”. He said it meant powerful people could “engage in a game of legal blood sport by dragging people through the Thai court system”.
