About 1,000 people could be eligible to apply, according New Zealand media reports. 'Stigma and prejudice' \nA petition was introduced to parliament last July, asking for a process to reverse those convictions brought before 1986 and for an apology from the government. \nOn Thursday, Ms Adams apologised while addressing reporters. \n\"Although we can never fully undo the impact on the lives of those affected, this new scheme will provide a pathway for their convictions to be expunged,\" Ms Adams said. \n\"It means people will be treated as if they had never been convicted, and removes the ongoing stigma and prejudice that can arise from convictions for homosexual offences.\" \nOnly convictions between consenting adult men will be quashed, Ms Adams said, not those where the acts are still illegal today. \nBritain announced it would pardon thousands of men convicted of offences that once criminalised homosexuality last year and a 2012 bill allowed those with historical convictions for consensual gay sex to apply to have them disregarded.
