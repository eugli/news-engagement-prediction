For example, if you’re not quite sure which side of the climate change debate you agree with, an extended drought period in your region might easily lead you to the conclusion that global warming is quite real. \nConversely, a person on the fence opinion-wise might take several cold winters in a row as a sign that global warming doesn’t exist. \nUnfortunately, proponents of both sides of the debate tend to use these relatively insignificant and isolated local weather trends to bolster their arguments. Scientist finds startling proof that short-term human memory makes people believe in climate change myths \nUniversity of British Columbia geography professor Simon Donner conducted a study showing how public opinion regarding climate change is often swayed by recent weather events. \nFrom UBC News : \n“The study…finds a strong connection between U.S. weather trends and public and media attitudes towards climate science over the past 20 years – with skepticism about global warming increasing during cold snaps and concern about climate change growing during hot spells. \n“While many factors affect climate change attitudes – political views, media coverage, personal experience and values – the researchers suggest that headline-making weather can strongly influence climate beliefs, especially for individuals without strong convictions for or against climate change.” \nDonner says that recent extreme weather events and record-breaking temperatures are nothing out of the ordinary. \n“Broken records are a normal thing in a stable climate,” he said. “Atmosphere and oceans dynamics mean that low and high surface air temperature records are broken in some locations every year.” \n“What today seems remarkable and unprecedented was actually not that unusual in past winters,” he added. “We just have short memories.” \nOne of the most important actions Donald Trump has taken in the early days of his presidency has been to follow up on his campaign promise to open up the debate on climate change. His pledge to allow room for a real exchange of scientific opinions regarding the issue seems to have been a serious one, as he removed all the politicized climate change references from the official White House website immediately after his inauguration. \nLet’s hope that’s a signal that a real scientific debate can now commence, and the public can once again begin to rely on the information it receives from its elected leadership in the White House. \nSources:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:34:50.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
