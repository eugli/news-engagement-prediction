He addressed EPA employees briefly Tuesday during his first full day as as head of the agency.\nAlso   Trump slams 'planned' protests at GOP town halls \nPresident Trump claimed on Tuesday that \"liberal activists\" are purposely targeting Republican lawmakers who have held town halls since the new administration took over.\n\"The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists,\" the president wrote on Twitter.\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, drew national attention earlier this month when video emerged of angry constituents shouting \"do your job!\" during a tense 75-minute town hall in his home state.\nIn a similar fashion, a group of Iowans confronted Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley during an event in the Hawkeyes State Tuesday night.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 02/21/17 6:49 PM Top Story House GOP moves to undo Obama OSHA rule Bill would nullify a rule that made firms liable if they didn't record injuries in the previous five years.\nBy Sean Higgins • 02/21/17 6:22  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:06:35.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
