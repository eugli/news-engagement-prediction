The institution has struggled to lift its share of women managers to a third -- mirroring a similar challenge throughout Australia's workforce . Related Content Two more companies join blacklist of 'female-free' boardrooms An education problem \nBut Lowe's efforts to further gender equality face a problem: there's a dire shortage of women studying economics and finance . For economics, the recent ratio for schools in New South Wales was one for every two boys, according to government data. The upshot is that the competition for talented women is intensifying. \n\"At the end of the day, we can't all achieve our objectives unless there are more women studying economics,\" Lowe said in the interview, in which he didn't discuss monetary policy. \"Companies can compete with one another, and those particular women will do very well, both financially and career-wise, but we won't all be able to achieve our objectives.\" Advertisement \nWhile the RBA's female representation is in a similar range to developed-world peers, it lags regional counterparts. Thailand's central bank had a female governor from 2006 to 2010 and half of 60 executive roles are held by women, while Zeti Akhtar Aziz ran Bank Negara Malaysia from 2000 until last year. \nIn the Federal Reserve under Janet Yellen's leadership, some 37 per cent of its executives and senior level officers were women in 2015, according to the Fed's Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Among other peers, Russia's and Israel's central banks are led by women. SHARE Luci Ellis was named assistant governor overseeing economic analysis and research.

Organisations like the RBA are in the ideas business, developing them and seeing if they withstand scrutiny, and that doesn't work as well in a uniform group.

But it's facing stiff competition from the nation's major banks and other financial institutions also striving to boost their female numbers.

Among women studying economics, only a small proportion do the macroeconomic and finance side that the RBA traditionally targets. The bank now includes graduates in labor market, welfare and health economics who've got the skills required. Most of the specifics are learned on the job. \nIn addition to the appointment of Luci Ellis as assistant governor overseeing economic analysis and research and acting as Lowe's chief economic adviser, Michele Bullock was named assistant governor for the financial system. At the departmental level, Alexandra Heath is head of economic analysis, which advises on monetary policy, and Marion Kohler was named head of the domestic markets department, which implements policy. \n\"We've never had that before,\" Lowe said. \"Hopefully that sends a pretty strong message that yes, if you're a woman you can have a successful career at the Reserve Bank, and to girls, to the extent that they're interested in reading the newspapers and listening to what's going on, they can see women in senior positions.\" \nBut there are problems further back in the chain. Lowe cited conversations with female employees who said the terminology and examples in school economics are often gender-laden. In addition, teachers tend to be male, older, and their classes dull. Ironically, that contrasts with Lowe's own experience in the country town of his birth, Wagga Wagga, where his inspirational teacher Mrs King nourished his enthusiasm for the subject. \n\"She'd always say that economics is about understanding how we meet the unlimited wants of people with limited capacity,\" said Lowe, who went on to study at??the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I thought, that's kind of an intrinsically interesting question. And it was her constant refrain: so how do we do this best?\" Other skills \nAs Lowe seeks progress on equality, the RBA's view of its ideal employee is also evolving. In the past, men who excelled at math, macroeconomics and debating were generally seen as best. While these skills remain important, Lowe said other attributes are coming to the fore. \n\"Influencing people, managing people, drawing out ideas from others and responding to them,\" he said. \"This is what a successful economist at the Reserve Bank looks like.\" \nLowe's ultimate aim is to establish a strong bench of female executives at the RBA, where he began a seven-year term as governor in September. That surely begs a follow-up question to his daughter's initial one: How long until a woman gets the top job? \n\"At least six years and nine months!,\" laughed Lowe. \"Not that I'm counting.\" \nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:56:33.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
