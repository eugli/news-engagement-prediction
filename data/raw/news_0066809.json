Jason Rapert, told Reuters. \nPresident Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives in 1998. The Senate acquitted him on the charges in 1999. \nThe bill--which does not name the Clintons by name-- would prohibit the “naming of public buildings, structures, airports, or facilities” after anyone living. \nThe legislation also calls for the ban of naming an airport after an elected official who served in the 10 years \"preceding the construction\" of the structure. \nReuters reported that Rapert claimed that several people in Arkansas shared their feelings on the airport being named after the Clintons. \nThe commercial Arkansas airport, just outside Little Rock, was renamed in 2012 to the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport/Adams Field. \n\"I happen to think that the naming of the airport as it is doesn't have any negative impact on our state or on our city,\" the Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola told ArkansasMatters.com. \"As a matter of fact I think it is the opposite.\" \nAlyssa Madruga is a news editor for FoxNews.com.
