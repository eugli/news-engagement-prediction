Mr Legier is regularly seen accompanying Ms Le Pen to events, and in the past has protected Hollywood celebrities ranging from Charles Bronson and Mel Brooks to Sean Penn. Before starting work for Ms Le Pen in 2011, he spent decades looking after her father, the convicted racist and anti-Semite Jean-Marie Le Pen, who founded the FN in the 1970s. But Mr Legier has never been linked to any EU work whatsoever, meaning that the thousands received from European taxpayers - including British ones - should never have been paid. Ms Le Pen was also said to have produced a false employment contract on behalf of Ms Griset, a long-time friend, as part of the same money-spinning arrangement. Ms Grist was meant to be a parliamentary assistant in Brussels from December 2010, but in fact spent all her time at the FN headquarters, which is also in Nanterre. According to the leaked papers, Ms Le Pen has 'finally admitted' the charges, saying she had simply wanted to 'regularise unpaid salaries and charges. 'But she denies this, and is refusing to pay the money back, saying she is being victimised for political reasons. The scandal comes as Francois Fillon, the right-wing Republicans party candidate for the presidency, also faces charges for a fake jobs scandal involving his British-born wife, Penelope, and their two children. French voters have called for Fillon to be jailed over allegations he created fake jobs for his wife, Penelope, and their two children Details were sent to Paris by the president of the European Parliament who has estimated the total loss to the taxpayer of the two fictitious salaries at approaching £300,000. Paris prosecutors have opened a judicial investigation for a variety of corruption charges including breach of trust and organised fraud - all of which carry prison sentences of up to 10 years. They today confirmed that both Mr Legier and Mr Griset were in custody, and - like Ms Le Pen - could face imminent criminal charges. The scandal comes as Francois Fillon, the right-wing Republicans party candidate for the presidency, also faces charges for a fake jobs scandal involving his British-born wife, Penelope, and their two children. As the French right faces up to such sleaze scandals, independent candidate Emmanuel Macron is currently the favourite to win the presidential elections in May.
