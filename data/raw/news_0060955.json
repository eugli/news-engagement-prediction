The UAE is already home to a number of Tesla’s Destination chargers, which are available at 26 locations across the UAE, including hotels and shopping malls. Tesla will add more than 50 additional Destination charging locations by the end of the year,” Tesla officials said in a statement.\nThe company said customers looking to explore the new lines of Model S and Model X can log on to www.tesla.com/en_AE for details.\n“Customers in the UAE can now visit the online design studio to customise and order the Tesla vehicle that best suits their lifestyle. First orders of Model S and Model X vehicles are expected to be delivered in Dubai this summer,” the company said.\nThe launch of the UAE’s dedicated online platform is supported by a pop-up store in The Dubai Mall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:19:48.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
