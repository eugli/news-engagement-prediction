Appin, West Scotland (CNN) The snow-capped mountains in Appin, West Scotland, are a hiker's paradise. They attract hundreds of tourists every year and up until a couple of years ago, many would have stayed at the 37-bedroom Stewart hotel. It now lies in ruins and its former owner Shamsul Arefin is serving a three-year prison sentence for the labor trafficking of a group of men from Bangladesh. Among the victims was Abdul Azad. He was a chef in his family's business back home in Dhaka, when was attracted by an advert in the local paper advertising chef work in the UK. The job offer included an annual salary of around $22,500, as well as paid holidays, free food and accommodation, according to court documents. 'Master and servants' Read More In 2009, Azad arrived in the UK, leaving his wife and son behind. But at the hotel, the work was very different from what had been promised. As well as working in the kitchen, Azad had to clean rooms, work in the garden, clear snow and provide labor for tradesmen. Stand up to modern slavery on March 14 -- #MyFreedomDay What's more, as a condition of the job offer, Arefin had demanded an initial payment of about $6,200 to sponsor the men's visas and he later wanted even more money, the documents show. To pay the fees, Azad says he had to sell his wife's jewelry and a small piece of land that his father owned. And far from the promised salary, Azad was told he would be paid only $125 per week, with the shortfall made up later -- but, according to the documents, he was not even paid that. Even once the men realised the harsh reality of their situation, they felt unable to leave. They felt bound to their Arefin, having paid him thousands of dollars for sponsorship visas, and Azad felt that, as their sponsor, Arefin had power over them. Azad told CNN: \"[Arefin] had the sponsorship license, he could do anything and he used to always show us this. 'If you don't do this, I can cancel [the sponsorship] and you have to move back and you may be illegal and the police will arrest you.' \"So we say nothing, because he was the sponsor, just like a master. He was the master and we were his servants.\" JUST WATCHED", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:56:08.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
