The mentality is that ‘it will not happen to me’ and if it does, Bomba (the Fire department) is always there. \n“Spend a bit of money and invest in these life-saving items. A smoke detector is only around RM100 apiece,” he said, adding that during community outreach programmes, he always encouraged the public to install smoke detectors in their houses. \nKhirudin said smoke detectors are very sensitive and can detect smoke in the early stages of a fire, giving the occupants enough time to escape. \nOnce the alarm goes off, it will emit an audio signal of around 90 decibels, which is said to be sufficient to awaken a hibernating bear. \nKhirudin said smoke detectors should ideally be placed in each bedroom, kitchen and the stairs. \n“As for fire extinguishers, it is best to have at least one for each floor. Some may say that the standard ones are too heavy, but there are so many portable models now ranging from 1kg to 10kg each. \n“The fire blankets on the other hand are usually placed in kitchens,” said Khirudin. \nHe revealed that during community outreach programmes, he learnt that only 10 out of 100 had fire extinguishers at home. \nHe aims to ensure each household has at least one extinguisher. \nChecks at hardware shops and online stores showed that smoke detectors were priced around RM100, fire extinguishers ranging from 2kg to 9kg at between RM85 and RM150, and between RM50 and RM100 for fire blankets. \nKhirudin also advised the public to make sure all electrical appliances were switched off before leaving their houses and before going to bed. He said most home fires were caused by faulty electrical appliances. \nIncidents also happened when someone forgets to switch off the power sockets where plugs are still connected or overloading a socket with two or more electrical appliances attached. \n“After a long period, the insulator will not be able to take the load and it will overheat. This might cause some ‘crackling’ and if there are combustible items such as paper, curtains or carpets nearby, that’s how the fire starts. \n“You should also try not to leave your smartphone charging overnight. \n“If it needs charging, place it on non-combustible materials such as cement floors or tiles, not on wooden tables or your bed,”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:24:46.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
