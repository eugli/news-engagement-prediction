Photo: Brett Coomer, Staff Texans' training camp moving to West Virginia 1 / 5 Back to Gallery \nThe Texans made it official today that they will move training camp to The Greenbrier at White Sulpur Springs, W.Va. \nReports surfaced last week that the Texans were planning to replace New Orleans at The Greenbrier. \nThis is the first time they will not have camp at their Houston Methodist Training Center across the street from NRG Stadium. \nThe dates for training camp and times for practices will be announced later. \n\"We are thrilled with the opportunity to hold training camp at the Greenbrier,\" general manager Rick Smith said in a statement. \"It's a wonderful place, and the facilities and climate combine for an ideal environment as our team trains, bonds and prepares for the 2017 season.\" \nOwner Bob McNair said last week that one reason the Texans were moving to West Virginia is because of better weather. The temperature is a lot cooler than in Houston during training camp in August. \nThe Saints were the first team to train at The Greenbrier. They had camp in White Sulphur Springs the last three years. After their contract expired, the Saints didn't renew, and they're expected to move camp back to Louisiana.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T18:51:15.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
