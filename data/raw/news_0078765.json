Democrats even tapped an illegal immigrant “Dreamer” to deliver their party’s official Spanish language response to the president’s speech. \nThe dichotomy between valedictorians and felons in the illegal immigrant community has been on display over the last two years as Mr. Trump has tried to give the victims of illegal immigrant crime the same profile as the illegal immigrants themselves. \nThe White House said Mrs. Trump will host Jessica Davis and Susan Oliver, widows of detective and a sheriff’s deputy killed by an illegal immigrant who went on a shooting and car-jacking rampage in 2014.
