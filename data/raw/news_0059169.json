The group assembled at Los Angeles’ No Name included director Paul Haggis, musicians Moby and Jenny Lewis, and actors Jeff Bridges, Rita Wilson and Jeremy Renner, per The Hollywood Reporter . \nHe added: “So, if she doesn’t win, to the winners in here, I hope you do the same, ya know?” Now this: Jack Black applauds Meryl Streep's courageous @goldenglobes speech, hopes she wins Oscar, goes after @POTUS again. pic.twitter.com/DALs4phji4 — Chris Gardner (@chrissgardner) February 24, 2017 \n“A lot of people say, ‘Oh, that’s just liberals patting themselves on the back,’” Black said about the reaction to Streep’s comments, which inspired a couple tweets from the president himself . \n“I don’t agree. I thought it took balls. Thought she was very brave. I was very inspired by it. To get up there and tell the truth about the president of the United States in front of a billion people — that takes courage, and it’s very inspiring.” \nOthers in Hollywood wholeheartedly agreed . \nWhile host Jimmy Kimmel doesn’t seem keen on making a grand political statement, we can’t know what to expect from the night’s biggest winners. \nThe Oscars will kick off with red carpet coverage on Sunday, Feb. 26, at 7 p.m. ET on ABC.
