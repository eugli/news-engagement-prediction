Gorgeous imagery, infographics, or vectors all give websites and blogs the extra “oomph” needed to turn a basic site into a stellar representation of your brand.\nHaving high-quality, good resolution images is part of this design puzzle. Luckily, there are several free image resources available to minimize the time you spend looking for the perfect picture.\nBefore we get into the list of reputable free image services, there are some points of differentiation for images that every small business owner needs to know. Public Domain and Creative Commons are two terms that many haven’t heard of, but should be familiar with before downloading images and putting them on a website or blog.\nFor those of us who love a good definition, below are official descriptions of the two types of images:\nPublic Domain - “The person who associated a work with this deed has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.” Creative Commons (CC0) - “CC0 gives those who want to give up those [copyright laws] a way to do so, to the fullest extent allowed by law. Anyone can then use the work in any way and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, subject to other laws and the rights others may have in the work or how the work is used. Think of CC0 as the “no rights reserved” option.” In essence, these terms mean you don't need to cite, or link, to the image’s owner on your website - though in most cases you should give credit where it's due. This is a huge advantage for small business websites and blogs, as it removes liability for posting the image on your web pages.\nOnline imagery can be tricky, and knowing how to correctly navigate photo licensing is incredibly important.\nEnsure you use images from Public Domain and Creative Commons sites only to maintain a reputable online presence.\nResources for Photographs, Vectors, and Illustrations These sites are great catchalls for image research. They have photos, vectors, videos, and illustrations, all with image counts in the hundreds of thousands.
