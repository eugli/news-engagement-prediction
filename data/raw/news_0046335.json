These speculations and fabrications are clearly designed to tarnish our reputation, and they specifically target our employees, including myself, to the point of harassment,\" said Sikka in the email, titled \"Focus, in times of distraction\". \n\nHe added that such stories create \"a false alternate-reality\" that \"mislead and sensationalize\". \n\nThe email comes on a day when an anonymous complainant wrote an email to regulators -Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) - alleging that the Infosys board has not addressed serious corporate governance issues and conflict of interest issues related to CEO Sikka. \n\nAlso read: Infosys now faces anonymous plaint on governance \n\nET, along with two other publications, received a copy of the email on Sunday, marked to two other publications apart from the regulatory bodies. \n\nInfosys, India's second-largest IT company, is publicly listed on stock exchanges in India and the US. The complainant, who claims to be an employee, said he or she is willing to talk to regulators and reveal all information \n\nSikka said Infosys has categorically denied the allegations in the stories, \"but they still get published. As we’ve publicly said before, we take every whistleblower complaint very seriously, and there is due process to investigate any complaint that comes to us,\" he added in the email. \n\nHe urged employees to not get distracted by such stories and focus on achieving the goals set out by the company as artificial intelligence and digitization become more and more mainstream. \n\n\"I am, as always, counting on your faith and unwavering attention to what really matters...I am counting on all of us to rise above the distractions, focus on what really matters, and deliver,\" Sikka said. \n\nHere is the full text of Sikka's letter: \n\nDear Friends, \n\nOnce again today, some newspapers have carried false and malicious stories about our company; this time it is about the acquisition of Panaya. These speculations and fabrications are clearly designed to tarnish our reputation, and they specifically target our employees, including myself, to the point of harassment. They create a false alternate-reality out of events and dates, with embellishments that are calculated to mislead and sensationalize. We have categorically denied the allegations in these stories, but they still get published. \n\nAs we’ve publicly said before, we take every whistleblower complaint very seriously, and there is due process to investigate any complaint that comes to us. \n\nHowever, there is no doubt that these attacks are orchestrated by people who are hell-bent on harming the reputation of the company, and its employees. We cannot let these stand unchallenged , and we will take every step and pursue every avenue to strongly defend the company in the face of these unfair and unwarranted attacks. \n\nAnd yet, though these distractions are expensive, draining and time-consuming, it is our burden to ensure that our company’s business continues unflinchingly. As I have written previously, we have far bigger battles ahead of us. STRAP is a couple of weeks out, and we need to have a strong close to the year, while simultaneously preparing for a new year ahead. A year that promises to be full of relentless disruptions and wondrous opportunities, and a year that will decisively separate the “has beens” in our industry from the “to-bes”. \n\nI am, as always, counting on your faith and unwavering attention to what really matters. Change is never easy, and change at the scale that we are undertaking may be unprecedented, and perhaps it is this change that has so inflamed some into trying to drag us all into the mud. And yet, change we must. There is no other way. In the time of AI and of a pervasively digitizing world, our success will depend on our ability to automate, innovate and educate our way to the top. Our success will be a success for all of us, including those whose ample shoulders we stand on, Iur failure will be more than a failure of a company- it will be a failure of an industry, and a dream. And we cannot let that happen. \n\nLast week when I shared the results of the our journey with many investors and financial analysts in Mumbai and elsewhere, it was very clear that the vast majority of them, and our clients, are with us 100%; they understand the path we are on, and its significance, and are deeply supportive. As I was flying home, I visited a very old Buddhist temple en-route. It was a fleeting peaceful moment in an unnecessarily difficult week. But the row of Buddhas there, in a moment of clarity, indicated to me that with compassion and unflinching resolve, we will get there. We must, and we will. \n\nI am counting on all of us to rise above the distractions, focus on what really matters, and deliver. \n\n\n\nBest, \n\nV Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T18:00:16.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
