Some hackers have taken advantage of that vulnerability, taking over more than a dozen small-radius radio stations which did not update their transmitter's security. Since the president's inauguration on Jan. 20, they've been set to play an anti-Trump anthem on repeat . \nThe song in question is \" FDT (F*ck Donald Trump) \" by YG and Nipsey Hussle. (As you might expect, it is chock full of NSFW language.) The rapper YG offered to perform the song at Trump's inauguration for $4 million, but apparently the Inauguration Committee, despite hurting for quality acts , did not go for it. \nArs Technica reports that at least a dozen FCC-approved stations have reported being hacked over the past few weeks, but it's unclear how many others simply haven't reported the issue. The hack only affects Barix Exstreamer products, which, as it was uncovered last year, are vulnerable to having their remote login credentials compromised if they're not placed behind a firewall or VPN. Back in April of last year, stations using this model of transmitter were hacked to play a podcast about furries . \nAccording to Radio Insight, in this recent incident, the hackers' IP address has been discovered and passed on to the FCC .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:14:28.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
