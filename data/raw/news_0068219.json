I’m sad that I should have known that people in my life would sell me out before I was ready,' she wrote. 'Like any normal person, I want it to be a happy time.' 'Please know this was a choice I made, I already know some won’t agree but I’ve been showered with support by the ones I love since I found out. 'Why did I wait? I’ve had a lot of health complications leading up to this pregnancy and I was not ready to release such private information on my own just yet being that I am so high risk with this pregnancy. I didn’t want to announce just to have another miscarriage and suffer through another grief. The first two: The star already has sons Isaac, aged seven (from Lowry’s relationship with ex-boyfriend Jo Rivera), and Lincoln, aged three (from her marriage to ex-husband Javi Marroquin) She went on to point out she had been filmed on her show saying she didn't want any more kids. 'I know so many will have comments on this but here’s the thing — I didn’t want to bring another child into a failing marriage,' she continued. 'Shortly after I started having complications, the option of having more kids was almost taken away from me. When I started thinking long and hard, I knew I wanted more. This was the choice I made. This is the baby I thought I wasn’t sure if I could have. I know this isn’t an ideal situation but I know everything will be okay. 'Having another child is something I am so happy about and I just can’t wait. My boys are so excited, those who love me are so excited, and I hope that everyone can just be happy for me during this time.'

Over: She finalized her divorce from Marroquin recently. They wed in 2012 and split in May 2016. Pictured 2014 In 2015 she suffered a miscarriage. She told People: 'I like to think that everything kind of happened for a reason. 'I'm not really sure what the reason was yet for that, but I'm just constantly reminding myself that there was a reason why this happened.' Earlier this month Marroquin slammed Lowry after a bitter Twitter spat. The Teen Mom star told Us Weekly he is 'absolutely' done with the 24-year-old, adding: 'I'm disgusted when I look at her.' He added: 'I thought things were really great, [until] a very reliable source came up to me and brought some new things to light that I didn’t know about, so all of that went right out the window.' The former couple became embroiled in a very public spat after this week's the latest episode of Teen Mom 2. The first baby daddy: Jo Rivera and Lowry attend the 2016 MTV Movie Awards in Burbank 'I thought we divorced cause she didn't want more kids? That's weird, he tweeted on Monday night.

The mother-of-two suffered a miscarriage during season seven of the show; Javi subsequently apologiZed for saying that he blamed her. 'That was last season and I apologized for that and I have my own little theory that will come up eventually but if she wants to keep throwing that around, so be it,” he told the magazine. 'I already apologized on camera to her and she’s lucky I was sleeping when she said that because I had a comeback but she deleted it by the time I woke up.'
