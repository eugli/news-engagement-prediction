Its only right i let everyone know how silly i have been. [sic] WENN 7 The pair have been dating for the past seven months after meeting on CBB \n“Marnie Simpson is an amazing person and i have done something seriously messed up to a very special girl. Ive now met anyone in my life kinder, more caring & more beautiful inside and out and i feel very grateful i got the chance to meet and fall in love with someone so special.[sic] Lewis Bloor cheats on Marnie Simpson on VALENTINE'S DAY with girl he met in carpark \n\"And yes i did and still do love Marnie ive just been very foolish and got very drunk. I myself know that my actions are unforgivable and apologise to Marnie, her family and mine for the pain that I've caused.

I have alot to think about so i will be staying off social media for the forseeable future. [sic] \n\"I am utterly disappointed in myself for hurting such an amazing girl, she did not deserve any of the pain i have caused. [sic] \n\"It was a drunken mistake, a terrible thing i wish i had the courage to just admit my wrong doing so Marnie did not have to find out from these girls.[sic] PA:Press Association 7 In the statement he referrred to Marnie as 'the most beautiful person inside and out' \n\"I was with Marnie for the right reasons. Alot of the stuff thats been said is lies. That doesnt change the fact of what i have done.[sic] \n\"You all have the right to think badly of me. Today, i think worse of myself than any of you possibly can. Marnie is a great girl and i am clearly a fool for ruining what was something very special. \"[sic]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:56:17.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
