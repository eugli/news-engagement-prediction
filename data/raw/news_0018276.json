UPCOMING TOUR \nHowever, this week, WWE took a very different approach when promoting their upcoming tour of France. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

Article continues below \nDespite the video below being in French, a Reddit user, JJohnson1979, translated exactly what Owens was saying, and it’s still hilarious. HEEL PROMO \nHe said: “On May 9th, WWE is coming back to France, and they asked me to talk in French about the event, and to smile and say how I’m excited to be back, but the truth is, I’m not. \n“Because, although I do speak French, I’m from Quebec, which is way better than France. \n“So, people who wanted me to be happy and excited to come back, forget about it! \n\"On May 9th, I’ll come to France, destroy my opponent, whoever he is, hop back on the plane and get the hell out of there as soon as possible,” before walking off. \nIt’s a clever tactic by WWE to utilise Owens, and give fans something to look forward to when he’s in the ring, as his last appearance in France saw him deliver a promo in English before he was powerbombed through a table by Rollins. \nWhat did you make of Kevin Owens’ promo in French?
