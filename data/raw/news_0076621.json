The pair engaged in a friendly Instagram Live battle over the weekend, with Swizz narrowly gaining the win over Just with an unreleased track that featured a few rap legends. \nOn Thursday, the two rap behemoths were seen together in a video clip via Swizz Beatz’s Instagram page announcing their Friday night beat battle. Just playfully talked trash in saying he was going to “take out” Swizz and announcing the rules for the battle along with an accompanying clip of Swizz showing respect for his friend but saying he’s prepared for war.

Hosted by Hot 97’s Ebro Darden and attended by the likes of Busta Rhymes, the gentlemen sparred using classic breakbeats like “Pump Me Up” and “Big Beat,” displaying little rarely televised DJ skills from the two. \nFrom there, live beat construction took place with Swizz and Just clearly enjoying the moment as a crowd of onlookers gathered in the studio while mashing up some of their classic productions. Freeway’s classic “Roc the Mic” was an early crowd pleaser with Swizz treating the affair more like a Jamaican sound system clash with rare exclusives and strong cuts such as “Banned From TV” from N.O.R.E. among others. \nHowever, near the end of the battle, Swizz pulled out the big secret weapon in playing an energetic unreleased track featuring longtime collaborator DMX, Jadakiss, Jay Z and Nas. Needless to say, the reaction in the room told all the stories it needed to, including Busta breaking into patois to describe what he just witnessed. \nCheck out the entire beat battle between Just Blaze and Swizz Beatz in the clip above.
