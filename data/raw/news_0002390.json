It was time, Springer thought, to pull out the new move that has fast become his favorite. Springer executed a “slide-by,”grabbing Tibbits’ head with one arm and an arm with the other, then throwing Tibbits’ arm over his head and sliding around him to earn the two-point takedown needed for a 5-4 victory. “I’d seen the move before but I’d never really tried it,” Springer said. “I learned it this year and I tried it out in a match against a pretty good kid and won. I thought ‘Well, this really works.’ I’ve had a lot of success with it.” The victory capped a 5-0 week for Springer, who improved to 26-5 on the season. He hopes his performance of late will move him back into the Class 3A state rankings. He was ranked earlier in the season but fell out after a tough week in some big tournaments. “It’s motivation for me,” he said. “And if I see I’m wrestling a ranked kid, it gets me more pumped.” SAM FISCHER St. Croix Lutheran • wrestling The junior 182-pounder has won 14 of 17 matches in January. He’s won seven in a row, five by pin. He stuck all three of his opponents in the St. Croix Lutheran Quadrangular on Saturday, two days after bumping up to 195 pounds and pinning a foe from Cooper.
