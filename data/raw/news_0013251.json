The court should decline.\" \nThey also lodged a statement by a host of national security officials - including former secretaries of state John Kerry and Madeleine Albright, and former CIA director Leon Panetta - which describes the travel ban as ineffective, dangerous and counterproductive. \nLawyers for tech firms including Apple and Google have also lodged arguments with the court, saying that the travel ban would harm their companies by making it more difficult to recruit employees. \nPresident Trump has attacked the federal judge who originally blocked his travel ban and the judiciary in general, saying Americans should blame the courts \"if something happens\". \nMr Trump also said he had instructed border officials to check people entering America \"very carefully\". \nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, Mr Trump said: \"I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!\" \n\"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\" US border checks All persons arriving at a US port of entry are inspected by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers Visitors must have valid US visas or hold \"Green Cards\" that authorise them to live and work in the US permanently Travellers under the Visa Waiver Program must apply for authorisation via ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization) before their visit Image copyright EPA Image caption A CBP officer at Atlanta airport Visitors must complete declaration forms Travellers may have their fingerprints and photos taken CBP officers may also ask to inspect luggage or personal items CBP uses biometric technologies to verify travellers' identities Travellers from certain countries can use Automated Passport Control (APC) \nUS federal judge James Robart's ruling on Friday prevents elements of President Trump's executive order being implemented. \nWashington and Minnesota argue that the ban is unconstitutional and denied people with valid entry documents the right to travel without legal recourse. It also violated freedom of religion rights by appearing to target Muslims, they said. \nThe ruling suspends: the seven-country travel ban; the temporary refugee admissions ban; the reprioritisation of minority religion (interpreted to mean Christian) refugee claims; and the ban on Syrian refugees. \nThe cap on overall US refugee admissions this year of 50,000 is not covered by the judge's ruling. \nIn its appeal , the justice department said Judge Robart had overreached by \"second guessing\" the president on a national security matter. \nIt also argued that only the president could decide who can enter or stay in the US.
