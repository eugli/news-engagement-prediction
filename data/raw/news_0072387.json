Source: Supplied \nThe four bedroom house, which has three marble fireplaces and has been in the one family for 90 years, will now be bulldozed to make way for an apartment block. \nSet amid apartments blocks, the deceased estate at 5 George Street, Marrickville in Sydney’s inner western suburbs, will be replaced by four levels of units on the 860sq m block. \nThe sale was triple the suburb’s median house price of $1.375m. \nAnother house which shattered its reserve price was Nirvana, a grand 1898 home in the lower North shore Sydney waterfront suburb of Longueville. This house in Longueville also smashed its reserve on the last weekend in February, selling at $1.5m above for $5.05m. Picture: realestate.com.au.

It’s come early, as many vendors want to capitalise on the strength of the market. \n“These are boom times for real estate.” \nCore Logic made an initial estimate of the weekend’s property clearance rate at 80.72 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:21:10.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
