I thought I would be killed when ABVP members dragged me in full view of the Delhi Police,” she said. \n“This is an attack on the idea of a university by the ABVP. They even grabbed my phone and broke it,” said Ms. Shora. \n“The ABVP is saying that they protested because anti-national students from JNU were coming to spoil Delhi University. I can safely say that, barring a handful, all students who had gathered for the march were from DU,” she added. \nMs. Shora also lashed out at the police, asking why they did not stop the ABVP members.
