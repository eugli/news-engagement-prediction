When the House of Representatives started session at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday, they were more than a dozen votes shy of the 55 needed to approve the tax cut. \nBy 11 p.m. Wednesday night, they were still trying to draft enough sweeteners to the bill to make it drinkable for a majority of the Republican caucus in order to get the deal done. \nRelated: Henderson: GOP insanity continues over income tax elimination \nThe latest version of the proposal was a big departure from the original House plan, which would have cut the tax to 3.9% in the first year and then gradually eliminate the tax over the next 39 years. \nBut leaders ran up against opposition from nearly all Democrats and many Republicans, including Gov. Rick Snyder, who weren't prepared to blow a $1.1 billion hole in the state budget over the next four years without a plan on either how to replace the money or which parts of the budget would be cut \n\"With 24 years experience in governmental budgeting, this whole process is totally backward. We have not even talked about potential cuts or funding priorities,\" said state Rep. Larry Inman, R-Williamsburg. \"We have not even looked at other states to see how they have handled drops in their income tax rate and we have no contingent plans for any budget short falls.\" \nThe House Tax Policy committee approved the income tax elimination on a party-line vote last week after one 90-minute hearing, cutting the state's largest source of revenue for the general fund that supports everything from state police, environmental protections, the Corrections department and revenues to local government. \nRepublicans have said that in the last seven years that businesses had gotten the benefit of tax cuts, but regular citizens have been left out. They claimed that the tax cut would spur economic growth, but economists at the Brookings Institute have said that any economic boost from tax cuts is not obvious or a given. \nThe new version of the bill would reduce the income tax to 4.15%, beginning on Jan. 1, 2018, then to 4.05% in 2019, 3.95% in 2020 and 3.9% in 2021. The lost revenue in the first year, which comes three months into the fiscal year, would be $195 million; in the second year, it would be $463 million; in the third year, it would be $780 million, and by the fourth year, it would cumulatively translate into $1.1 billion less in state revenue. \nIt was that figure - and the lack of a plan to replace the money - that prompted Gov. Rick Snyder to say he was still opposed to the bill because he had \"a billion dollars worth of concerns.\" \nThe state Senate isn't much more supportive either. Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof, R-West Olive, said it is way too early to put his stamp of approval on the proposal. \n\"We have lots of other ideas on how to give people value for their money,\" he said. \"It has some significant opportunities, but opens up further opportunities to look at all the things we do.\" \nAnd Sen. Ken Horn, R-Frankenmuth, said he wants to make sure it's a fair and reasonable approach to tax policy. \"And we have to make sure the balance sheet works out.\" \nThere are seven states without an income tax — Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming — but most make up the difference with higher sales or property taxes or much higher state revenues from taxes on coal mining (Wyoming) or oil drilling (Alaska). \nContact Kathleen Gray: 313-223-4430, kgray99@freepress.com or on Twitter @michpoligal 2 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:23:01.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
