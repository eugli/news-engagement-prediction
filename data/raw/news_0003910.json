The case of culpable homicide was subsequently dismissed.\nHe also faced charges of injuring the dignity of five other boys who said they had been subjected to savage beatings.\nEdith Nyachuru, whose brother died at one of Mr Smyth's camps, say he would still be alive had the barrister faced justice in the UK Credit: CHANNEL 4 NEWS C ourt documents from the time state: “The particular allegations are that [Mr Smyth] made the complainants walk naked to the swimming pool at night; that he took showers with them in the nude; that he talked to them about masturbation and told them to be proud of their ‘dicks’; as Jesus Christ had one; and that he assaulted them on their ‘rear bare buttocks’ with a table tennis bat.”\nThe case against Mr Smyth collapsed in 1998, after he successfully persuaded Zimbabwe’s Supreme Court that prosecutors had overstated the claims and failed to follow proper procedures.\nA lawyer involved in the case told The Telegraph he had been “shocked” after the barrister privately admitted showering with the boys, and said he had warned Mr Smyth to stop.\nChannel 4 News has tracked down boys who attended the camps, who insist that the allegations are true.\nRocky Leanders, one teenage camper, said Mr Smyth had encouraged boys to talk about masturbation and told them to “just feel free to embrace your body and love your body”.\nWatch | Reporter tracks down man at centre of abuse allegations 01:21 H e told the broadcaster the barrister told the boys to swim naked, adding: “John took part in the activity. He certainly went in the pool. He was at various places throughout still naked, watching that we all went out and all came back in.”\nLater the boys claimed they were subjected to beatings with a table tennis bat and a jokari, another type of wooden racquet. Mr Leanders said he recalled one boy being beaten so hard that the table tennis bat broke. He said: “I remember I could barely sit down because my bum cheek was so sore.”\nMr Nyachuru’s sister, Edith, said that had Church authorities reported Mr Smyth to the police in Britain in 1982, “my brother wouldn’t meet the fate he met”.\nApproached by Cathy Newman, the Channel 4 newsreader, Mr Smyth said Mr Nyachuru’s death was “a very unfortunate drowning incident”.\nHe said he had not left Britain because of abuse claims, but because “God called us to Zimbabwe”.\nReverend David Fletcher opted not to pass the allegations to police Credit: CHANNEL 4 NEWS T he Archbishop yesterday pledged to co-operate fully with a police investigation into his former friend.\nIn an interview yesterday, he repeated his “unreserved and unequivocal” apology to the alleged victims. He insisted he had \"never heard anything at all” about the abuse claims, and had never encountered beatings in his religious life.\nIt has emerged that two friends of the Archbishop have known of the abuse claims since they first came to light, although a spokesman said neither informed him of the allegations.\nA 1982 report into the claims, commissioned by the Iwerne Trust, was carried out by Mark Ruston, the vicar of the Round Church in Cambridge, with whom the Archbishop lodged during the late Seventies, in his final year at university.\nMr Smyth is now a public morality campaigner in South Africa Credit: CHANNEL 4 NEWS T he Archbishop has said his friendship with the Reverend Ruston was \"extraordinary privilege\" and he was \"inspired\" by him.\nA second friend of the Archbishop, the Reverend David Fletcher, was the trustee of the Iwerne Trust who led the investigation into the incidents.\nRev Fletcher opted not to pass the claims to police. He said: “My top priority was that John Smyth should be stopped and second that the men he beat were cared for.”\nA spokesman for the Archbishop said he “has not seen the Rev David Fletcher more than once or twice casually since the late 1980s”.\nWatch Channel 4 News investigation ‘An Ungodly Crime?’ on Friday at 7pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:12:21.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
