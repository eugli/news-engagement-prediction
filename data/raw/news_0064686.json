It isn't clear yet whether the tumor is benign or cancerous. Marouf filed an emergency bond request with the Dallas immigration court Friday afternoon to gain Beltran Hernandez’s release so that she can see a Fort Worth-area neurosurgeon. \n“She is afraid she is going to die in there,” said Marouf, director of the immigrant rights clinic at Texas A&M University School of Law. “She is also in an isolated room. It seems to be a form of solitary confinement and a form of punishment.” TAKE ACTION: Sara, a 26-year-old mother of 2 detained by @ICEgov , needs urgent medical care! Call now: 1-855-463-4511 #NoBanNoWall #FreeSara pic.twitter.com/mefmuNs774 — AmnestyInternational (@amnestyusa) February 24, 2017 \nAmnesty International is calling on its 1.2 million members to call ICE to ask for the Salvadoran woman's release. The \"Free Sara\" campaign was prompted because of Beltran Hernandez's medical condition and because of the U.S. treatment of certain Central Americans fleeing violence in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. They generally enter and ask for U.S. asylum — a complicated and lengthy process to prove under the persecution rules of U.S. asylum and refugee law. \nMarouf said Beltran Hernandez was in a wheelchair during their Thursday night visit. The young immigrant seemed to be in pain and ended the visit sobbing with her younger sister. That sister, Raquel Beltran Hernandez of New York City, is also fighting for her older sister’s release. \nICE officials have answered the Beltran Hernandez is getting treatment in the detention facility and access to care offsite as needed. \nBeltran Hernandez arrived in the Rio Grande Valley from El Salvador in November 2015. She left her two small children behind in her native country with the hopes of bringing them into the U.S. legally at a later date. RT to demand @ICEgov releases 26 year old Sara & give her the urgent medical care she needs #FreeSara #NoBanNoWall https://t.co/ESzGAK48lU pic.twitter.com/U8jSfagqF0 — AmnestyInternational (@amnestyusa) February 24, 2017 \nHer asylum request was denied by a Dallas immigration judge on Jan. 26. The case is now on appeal. \nLegal advocates in New York and the Dallas-Fort Worth area galvanized efforts on behalf of Beltran Hernandez because of the intensified immigration crackdown by President Donald Trump, and concerns that vulnerable populations such as asylum-seekers would not have sufficient protection. Friday afternoon, a protest was held outside of ICE offices in Manhattan. Family desperate to get private medical care for detainee with possible brain tumor \nBeltran Hernandez has been in detention in a variety of places in Texas since she arrived, Marouf said. In late January, she was transferred to the newly opened Prairieland center in Alvarado. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, has a contract with the Prairieland center for ICE detention of up to about 700 persons.

(Melissa Zuniga) \nAbout two weeks ago, Beltran Hernandez, who has no known criminal history, collapsed at Prairieland with head pain, two members of her legal team said. She was rushed to a Burleson hospital, Marouf and an ICE official have both confirmed. But on Wednesday, Beltran Hernandez was taken back to Prairieland. \n“Like all detainees in our care, Ms. Beltran will continue to have access to 24-hour emergency medical care and access to any required specialized treatment at an outside facility,” an ICE statement read on Thursday and again Friday. \nThe ICE statement said Beltran Hernandez was discharged from the hospital because she was stable. The agency also denied that Beltran Hernandez was shackled or scheduled for brain surgery or that she was \"forcefully removed\" from the hospital. \n\"ICE takes very seriously the health, safety and welfare of those in our care. Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment the families arrive and throughout their entire stay at the facility,\" a Friday ICE statement read. \nThe Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, an hour south of Dallas, opened its doors this January with a contract from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. (Louis DeLuca/The Dallas Morning News) \nICE spokeswoman Adelina Pruneda on Friday said in an email that the agency would answer no further questions. \nRaquel Beltran Hernandez, the younger sister of Sara Beltran Hernandez, waits to enter detention center in Alvarado. (Karina Ramirez, The Dallas Morning News/Al Dia) \nAmnesty International officials are worried about harsh treatment that they believe is increasing for immigrants seeking asylum and refuge in the wake of President Trump's trio of executive orders aimed at toughening immigration enforcement. \n“In the face of President Trump’s aggressive immigration orders, we will fight to ensure that people with asylum claims are given a fair hearing and humane treatment,” said Eric Ferrero, an Amnesty USA spokesman. \"People like Sara who are seeking asylum for horrific violence should not be treated like criminals while their cases are processed.” \nAmnesty USA lawyer Justin Mazzola said federal officials have the authority to grant public release so long as there is not a risk of flight. “They are fleeing conflict and violence and shouldn’t be locked up,” Mazzola said. \nFort Worth attorney Marouf agreed, saying Beltran Hernandez is not very mobile with a wheelchair and, legally now has a material change in her condition due to the brain tumor. If she is released to her family in New York, Beltran Hernandez stands a much better chance of getting health insurance as an unauthorized immigrant in New York, Marouf said.
