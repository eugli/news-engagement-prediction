Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) is “too liberal” to run the Democratic National Committee. Ellison is considered a front-runner in the election for DNC chair which will be held Saturday. \nHe made the comments to Vox, saying, “You’re going to be shocked at me telling you this: Ellison is too liberal to run the DNC.” \nEllison’s greatest competition is former labor secretary to Obama, Tom Perez. Elleithee explained why he was favored over Ellison, explaining, “Tom is not in bed with anybody — he served President Obama; he knows the Clintons — that doesn’t make him establishment any more than it makes me establishment. I served in Clinton and Obama’s administrations, but I’m not establishment.” \nBacked by the Bernie Sanders wing, Ellison is seen as the more progressive alternative to Perez, perceived as the establishment pick and backed by the Obama and Clinton wing of the party. Also in the running is the dark horse mayor from South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg. \nThe Sanders wing is the far more animated and spirited portion of the party, but their far left ideology is considered a negative after the devastating 2016 election. \n“The average voter in the United States is moderate,” Ellison explained. “A lot of people in my circles agree with that. And Ellison is too close to Bernie Sanders.” \nEllison has been dogged by accusations of anti-Semitism, something he addressed during the CNN debate for the DNC chair Wednesday. \n“These are false allegations, and that’s why I have 300 Rabbis and Jewish community leaders who signed a letter supporting me,” Ellison said, going on to cite works he had done on interfaith issues for the benefit of the Jewish community. \nHe also appeared to want to dish out some left-wing red meat for his progressive supporters during the debate, as he declared that President Trump was impeachable on the first day of his presidency. Some of the other candidates beat around the bush on the issue, wanting to not appear as extreme as Ellison. Perez, meanwhile, distinguished himself by touting cooperation among Democrats as being the “worst nightmare” of President Trump. \nDemocrats will vote for DNC chair Saturday in Atlanta, Georgia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:02:35.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
