Rude treatment for a revered hero, and only a day after a decent away result at Sevilla in the new fairytale which remains alive, the Champions League. \nLeicester legend Gary Lineker, he who tweeted an underwhelmed “Really?” when Ranieri was appointed, this time tweeted that his demise was “inexplicable, unforgivable and gut-wrenchingly sad”. \nBut, as cold and tough as the club looks today, you can see their point. \nDEPRESSING: The numbers that show full extent of Leicester slide \nIt was always going to be hard, impossible, to even come close to replicating the miracle of last season, when Leicester won the Premier League. As we long-suffering fans got up eagerly at 3.00am to watch and be transported to fairyland, the Foxes were switched on for every minute of all 38 games. It was, of course, incredible. \nThe fear, indeed the expectation, about this season was this: How could these players possibly lift themselves to play so superbly, so watchfully and with such discipline again, knowing simply that there was no way in the world they could win the league two years in a row? Claudio Ranieri. Source: AP \nAt this level, where everyone’s supremely talented, advantages are measured in millimetres. That 10 or even five per cent sag in motivation counts as enormous. \nIt’s why so few Major League Baseball clubs win two World Series in a row. Knowing they’ve got to go through all that again -- turn up, switch on with your full commitment, for 162 games, especially with the glow still warming you from the previous season’s triumph. \nEven as a lifelong Foxes fan, it was admittedly getting harder to set the alarm here in Australia, to be motivated to just sit there and watch. As with movies, there was no way the sequel could be as good as the original. \nHow could it possibly match? Does it really have to? Now that we’ve won it, who gives a hoot what happens this year (a sentiment Lineker also tweeted this term). \nHowever, several months into our defence, sitting dangerously close to relegation, the realisation looms large that obviously it does matter. \nLeicester have, as everyone knows, been very bad at being defending champions. Tellingly, on that issue of motivation, we’ve done far better in the new fairytale in Europe than in the old one in England. Happier days. Source: AFP \nMaking a better fist of a more realistic domestic aim, say to finish in the top 10, would have been nice. But the psychological spiral was soon in effect. Like winning, losing also becomes a habit. \nAt some point you have to cry enough. The person responsible for that difference-making motivation is the manager. And as always in football, it’s a lot easier, more sensible and ultimately more effective, to sack one manager than a large group of players, if the rot has set in. \nNo Leicester fan wants to see Ranieri treated harshly, booted out the door of the club he helped he so endearingly nurtured, like a beloved uncle, into the sport story of the century. But another scenario is more appalling. Would Foxes fans prefer to run the risk of being relegated again? Do we persevere with the adored Ranieri, when he’s steering us so close to the rocks? Or do we move now to head off this trouble before it becomes terminal, when its too late to turn back? \nWe Leicester fans know what it’s like to go down, and stay down. It’s horrible. Your players leave. Your stadium, so ebullient and incredible last season, contains vast, chilling, patches of empty seats. \nLeicester’s Thai billionaire owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha has, it must be remembered, been fantastic for the club. He’s rich because he’s a successful businessman who has made many tough calls. After we went up – following those 10 desolate years in the wilderness – he announced an aim to make Leicester a regular top five outfit. He wants his club to be a proper, serious entity, not some anomalous quirk everyone remembers for one freakish year. Most Leicester fans would feel the same. Claudio Ranieri. Source: AFP \nSrivaddhanaprabha is also no rich mug with a plaything in England. He knows the potential long-sentence to oblivion relegation can bring, as does anyone at Leicester. He’s been faced with two alternatives: to persist and risk, with the man who’s been at the helm of this decline; or to first stop the bleeding, and bring in someone who at the very least brings an emotional and mental freshness, someone who doesn’t represent a fading miracle. \nRanieri could possibly have been given a couple more weeks, a chance to see if Jamie Vardy’s goal in Seville could be the confidence-boost to turn a season. But when the club hasn’t scored a premiership goal all year, that would be another big punt. There are high stakes at play. The owner has spent many millions on new players this season. \nWe don’t need to feel sad for Ranieri, as Lineker says. The reason he was so good for Leicester last season is because he’s mature, experienced, sanguine and even-keeled. He’s also 65, close to a deserved walk into the sunset. Most likely he’ll take this sacking with the same realism and grace he’s always shown. Despite some of the often unfair tribulations of his managerial career, he’ll know the historical enormity of what he pulled off. \nAnd regardless of today, or anything else that happens, the Italian will still always be revered at Leicester, and admired across the football world. In 10 years time, he won’t be remembered as the bloke who got sacked, or even the guy who fumbled a title defence, but as the humble, canny and wonderful puppeteer of the greatest sport story ever told.
