Family-friendly during the day, a jaunt along the Savannah River will often afford views of seemingly larger-than-life ships as they enter the city, much to the delight of many children. If you find yourself waving as the ships pass, you are carrying on a tradition from one of the many legendary inhabitants of Savannah. As one of the South's oldest cities, Savannah has no shortage of legends. Legend of Florence Martus \nOne of Savannah's favorite stories involves the life of Florence Martus (1868 -1943), who was known well by Savannahians and sailors of the sea as the Waving Girl . The daughter of a sergeant stationed at Fort Pulaski , Florence later moved to a cottage along the river near the entrance of the harbor with her brother George, upon his upstream transfer from the Cockspur Island Lighthouse to the Elba Island Lighthouse. \ncontinue reading below our video Best Ride Sharing Apps of 2015 \nAs the story goes, life at the remote cottage was lonely for Florence whose closest companion was her devoted collie. At an early age, she developed a close affinity with the passing ships and welcomed each one with a wave of her handkerchief. Sailors began returning her greeting by waving back or with a blast of the ship's horn. Eventually Florence started greeting the ships arriving in the dark by waving a lantern. \nFlorence Martus continued her waving tradition for 44 years and it is estimated that she welcomed more than 50,000 ships during her lifetime. There is a lot of unsubstantiated speculation about Florence having fallen in love with a sailor who never returned to Savannah. The facts, however, about why she started and continued the waving tradition for so many years remain a mystery. \nIn any event, Florence Martus grew into a Savannah legend, known far and wide. On September 27, 1943, the SS Florence Martus, a Liberty ship, was christened in her honor. According to the Georgia Historical Society , it was the \"thirtieth of eighty eight liberty ships built in Savannah\", and was eventually scrapped in Baltimore. \nFlorence is laid to rest next to her brother in Laurel Grove Cemetery in Savannah. The head stone inscription resonates the admiration for their legendary service to the mariners. \nIN MEMORY OF THE WAVING GIRL AND HER BROTHER KEEPERS OF THE LIGHTHOUSE ON ELBA ISLAND, SAVH RIVER FOR 35 YRS. The Waving Girl Statue \nThe Waving Girl Statue by renowned sculptor Felix De Weldon, the sculptor of the United States Marine Corps Memorial in Arlington, Virginia (also known as the Iwo Jima Memorial,) depicts Florence with her loyal collie. The statue can be found at the eastern end of River Street, overlooking the Savannah River from the bluff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:31:08.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
