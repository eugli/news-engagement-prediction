(ABC News: Malcolm Sutton) \nMr Mullighan said design changes to return the cycling and pedestrian overpass to \"full working order\" would also commence immediately. \n\"I have been reassured from the advice I have received that the problems with this bridge are not expected to be experienced elsewhere,\" he told reporters. \nThe shared cycling and pedestrian path remains closed and access points are fenced, the Minister said, promising more safety and security measures would be implemented once the screens had been removed from the sides of the overpass. \nThe condition of 1,500 bridge structures across South Australia is now under review after the structural problems were found on the South Road overpass. \nThe engineering assessment said there was no reason to believe the tram overpass adjacent to the cycling and pedestrian overpass would face any similar incident. \nThe structure was built under a contract the SA Government reached in 2009 with McConnell Dowell and the design work was done by engineering firm AECOM, with certification from Wallbridge and Gilbert Consulting Engineers, Mr Mullighan said. \n\"We will now be beginning a process involving the Transport Department and Crown law to sit down with the companies that have provided this piece of infrastructure to taxpayers,\" he said. \n\"[We will be] making sure that they make good on the costs that have been imposed on the Government and imposed on the community by having to fix this bridge.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:27:24.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
