(Marta Iwanek/Canadian Press) Related Stories Future life expectancy in 35 industrialized countries, The Lancet (Note: CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links.) \nCanadians born in 2030 will live longer by a few years — to age 84 for a man and 87 for a woman — than the preceding generation, according to a U.K. study that projects life expectancies in 35 industrialized countries will continue to climb. \nThe study was led by Prof. Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London. Unlike previous studies that relied on one model, Ezzati and his team used 21 models to predict life expectancy — the same statistical technique weather forecasters use to assemble their projections in a systematic way. \nIn Canada, the life expectancy at birth for females in 2010 has been pegged at 83.94, compared with an expected 87.09 for those born in 2030. The corresponding figures for males are 79.41 and 83.89. The projections are in line with those from Statistics Canada. \nAmong the 35 countries, Canada stands at about the middle of the pack, at 19th, for projected change in life expectancy in women and 14th for men. 'I think it is kind of good news, bad news. Canada was higher and now we've been slipping a bit.' - Dr. Doug Manuel, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute \nIn the latest study, women in South Korea are projected to top life expectancy of people in the countries studied, with women born in 2030 forecast to live to nearly 91, Ezzati and his colleagues report in this week's issue of the medical journal The Lancet . Men in South Korea also lead in projected life expectancy, at about 84. \nThe increases in life expectancy in most developed countries is \"breathtaking,\" said Dr. Doug Manuel, a physician at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute who was not involved in the research but was asked to comment. He works on life expectancy calculators for the public to see how their lifestyles could affect their health. \n\"I think it is kind of good news, bad news. Canada was higher and now we've been slipping a bit,\" Manuel said. \nHe added that the good news for Canadians is they're likely to be able to enjoy those extra years with good-quality health. \n\"There's definitely warning signs as well when I see us just dropping through the ranks of OECD countries pretty quickly,\" Manuel said. \nFor instance, Manuel said, Australia stands out with life expectancy that is now leading Canada's. He suspects part of the difference could be how women in Canada in the 1960s took up smoking at much higher rates than Australia and the U.S. \nSocial inequality is another important piece to consider. Australia addressed it high minimum wages. Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador are considering basic income supports . South Korean women tops \nSince 1985, the first year South Korea provided data, there have been \"massive gains\" in the life expectancy of women in that country. \n\"They've been remarkable in investing in early childhood, nutrition, and education,\" Ezzati told BBC News. \"They have done very well in terms of controlling obesity and blood pressure. They seem to have been good at taking up new knowledge … and implementing it. And perhaps, sort of most importantly, they're doing this compared to a lot of Western countries in an equitable way.\" \nIn South Korea, there's also been a broad uptake of medical knowledge, know-how and technology — from specific guidelines and practices, to medicines and diagnostics — that seem to have reached much of the population, Ezzati added in an email to CBC News.

(Lee Jin-man/Associated Press) \nImprovements in health expectancy relate to improvements in prevention, Manuel said, in calling for inequalities to be reduced for low-income and Indigenous Canadians. \n\"If you think of inequalities as a kind of a disease, it's our major killer.\" \nReducing inequalities could make a bigger difference than eliminating heart disease, he said. \n\"I think the difference between life expectancy in Indigenious and non-Indigenous is one of our most notable, persistent and discouraging differences that we've seen in mortality in Canada.\" \nPeople in countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand benefit from high-quality health care to prevent and treat cancer and heart disease. They also have low rates of infant deaths and road traffic injuries. \nFor women, the study's authors expect these countries will top life expectancy in 2030: South Korea (90.8 years old). France (88.6 years old). ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:58:52.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
