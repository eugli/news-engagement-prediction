U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, while rescinding that requirement, said federal laws would still protect the LGBT students from \"discrimination.\" \n\"The Department of Justice has a duty to enforce the law. The prior guidance documents did not contain sufficient legal analysis or explain how the interpretation was consistent with the language of Title IX. The Department of Education and the Department of Justice therefore have withdrawn the guidance,\" Sessions wrote in a statement. \n\"Congress, state legislatures, and local governments are in a position to adopt appropriate policies or laws addressing this issue. The Department of Justice remains committed to the proper interpretation and enforcement of Title IX and to its protections for all students, including LGBTQ students, from discrimination, bullying, and harassment.\" \nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Sen Lois Kolkhorst, the top proponent and sponsor of Texas' bathroom bill, could not be immediately reached for comment on Wednesday. It is unclear whether their bill will be changed to take into account the Trump administration's decision. \nThe immediate effect on school policies will be little because the rules have been on hold nationwide since a Texas judge blocked their implementation last year. Since then, it's been up to individual districts to determine if and how they will help protect transgender students who walk their halls. \nBut LGBT rights advocates said rescinding the rules shows the president has little regard for transgender Americans. By giving states like Texas -- whose Republican leaders oppose greater rights for transgender people -- control over this issue, Trump is giving tacit approval to policies that discriminate against trans kids, they added. \n\"This is a demoralizing step for our president to take,\" said Lou Weaver, the transgender program coordinator for LGBT-rights group Equality Texas. \"It absolutely threatens the ability of transgender students to go to school in safe and supportive environments.\" Following a public Fort Worth ISD meeting, at which transgender policies in schools were discussed, Alison Francis of Hurst smiles as a full rainbow appears over the Fort Worth ISD Board of Education complex in Fort Worth.

Tom Fox - Staff Photographer \nTexas has been at the epicenter of the fight over the rights of transgender people. \nPatrick pressured the superintendent of the Fort Worth Independent School District to resign after he became one of the first school administrators t o agree to accommodate transgender students . Soon after, Texas sued the federal government in an attempt to block the guidelines nationwide. \nIt succeeded -- at least temporarily -- in December, when U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor put the rules on hold while considering whether to strike them down. Since then school districts have been setting their policies, which will continue for now. Obama appeals Texas transgender bathroom case to 5th Circuit \nIn Fort Worth, for example, district officials decided to determine bathroom usage for transgender students on a case-by-case basis. \n\"If something changes, either at a federal or state level, we'd send it to our counsel for review,\" FWISD spokesman Clint Bond said. \"We follow the law and if the law changes, we'd follow that too.\" \nThis would change if Texas politicians pass a bathroom bill this year. If it becomes law, this bill would take control away from districts, forcing them to require bathroom use based on a student's \"biological sex.\" Its proponents have said the bathroom bill was filed to mainly fight Obama's transgender student guidelines . \nThe decision also means the state's lawsuit against the guidelines could be dead, simply because there are no guidelines to fight over. \nBut Dale Carpenter, a constitutional law expert at Southern Methodist University, said he thinks the lawsuit could be revived if Texas officials don't like whatever school guidelines the Trump administration writes in the future. That, or an independent group like the ACLU could try to resurrect the suit by intervening in the case on behalf of transgender students. \n\"I'm not sure this is the end of the matter,\" Carpenter said. \"It seems to me that there may still be some attempt to protect transgender students after this.\" \nThe news isn't so good for Gavin Grimm, however. A transgender student from Virginia, Grimm fought for his right to use his school's boys bathroom all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices were supposed to hear his case this year, but they probably won't if the Justice Department drops the case. \nTrump's decision has caused a ripple effect across every state and up to the Supreme Court: The Obama guidelines are gone, but Texas' bathroom bill is here to stay. One lawsuit could be revived and another is likely dead. But Carpenter said the fight over transgender rights isn't going to calm down any time soon. \n\"It very may well signal the end of the line for this particularly,\" said Carpenter, \"but it is not the end of this issue, regardless of what the Trump administration does.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:27:47.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
