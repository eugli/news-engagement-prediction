Since then, he has played a key role in the development of a range of campaigns including, most prominently, Gatorade’s “farewell” spots for retiring athletes like Derek Jeter, Peyton Manning and Abby Wambach. Beyond those ads, he also helped develop last summer’s Serena Williams-themed Gatorade Snapchat game and a forthcoming campaign for Principal Financial Group. \nTBWA\\Chiat\\Day L.A. president Erin Riley praised the new creative leader as “relentless in his pursuit of excellence,” adding, “I can think of no one better to inspire, drive and diversify our creative output.” \nHis promotion marks the latest in a series of big changes at the Los Angeles office including Riley’s arrival, last summer’s executive shakeup and Nissan’s decision to consolidate its business on the East Coast , effectively ending a three-decade partnership with TBWA\\Chiat\\Day L.A.
