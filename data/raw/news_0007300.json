Think Company opened its third office this month on the second floor of the Philadelphia Building at Walnut and Juniper streets – near 13th Street, marking the fast-growing company's second space in the city and third office overall. Think Company's employees in its new Philly East Office on the second floor of the… more Courtesy of Think Company Called its \" Philly East \" office, the new office is specifically designed to be a creative gathering space focused on collaboration and an open-air feel, while its studio at 15th and Chestnut in the Packard Grande building is smaller and centers around day-to-day work and development. The two Center City offices have different feels and purposes, the same way Think Company's second and third floor at its Conshohocken headquarters does, said Executive Vice President Russ Starke , but each space also speaks to the company's aim to create focused experiences, whether digitally or in real life. \"As an experience design firm, it is as important for us to create an experience for our clients and our employees as it is to create those experiences in the work it is that we do. We take our own medicine in that respect all the time,\" said Starke, adding their operating style is to focus on needs first, and execution second. \"We don't create things to force people to use them the way we envision them. We look at how they're working, what do we need, then we codify those things rather than trying to lay down the law and having people adhere to them.\" About 30 of the company's roughly 76 employees are working out of the Philly East office, located just about three blocks from its \"Philly Think Space\" near City Hall. Starke said they didn't set out with a specific plan to either wait for additional space to grow their first Center City studio or open a separate location, but when they saw their newest office, they fell in love with it. \"There's a different vibe, a personality to each of the spaces, so they're optimized for different kind of work styles,\" he said. \"That really suits us well.\" The new space also allows the company — which landed at number 21 on the Philadelphia Business Journal's list of the 50 fastest growing companies in the region with a 35.6 percent growth in revenue over a two-year average — to continue expanding. Starke said they plan to continue its average of a 20 percent increase in staff over the next year, and may add another 10 to 15 employees in development, project management, visual design and user experience design roles. It was the company's initial move into the city in 2014 that helped spark its growth spurt, Starke said, as the location made them more desirable to the population of tech talent who aren't interested in commuting outside of the city. The development of new spaces is far from the only shift the company's undertaken in recent months, as it executed what Starke called a \"brand refinement\" through the name change from Think Brownstone to Think Company. The idea was to keep the part of the company's name that often stuck in clients minds and communicated its aim to \"helping people think,\" co-founder Brian McIntire said in a statement when the name change was announced. Dropping Brownstone also helped cut out initial misconceptions the company operated in the real estate or architecture industries. That was an even bigger issue back when the firm first launched as Brownstone Creative Partners, a nod to the founders' dreams of opening their own design firm in an open-air brownstone property somewhere. While the name change brought about concerns surrounding brand equity and SEO strength and visibility, Starke said, so far the transition has been \"eerily successful\" and less tumultuous than he expected. \"The connective tissue seems to have reconnected,\" he said. Another aim with the brand shift was to help the company gain wider appeal, better recognition, and as it eyes another year of growth, allow it to play more on the national and international stage.
