Others took a more extreme route , throwing eggs at the court building and painting explicit graffiti, including threats against Snelgrove's life, throughout the downtown.\nJustice Minister Andrew Parsons told CBC that he accepts the jury's not guilty verdict in the Const. Doug Snelgrove trial, but that he has a duty to ask questions in the wake of protests over the outcome. (CBC)\nOn Saturday, Justice and Public Safety Minister Andrew Parsons sent out a tweet that stated \"While history has taught us the presumption of innocence is paramount, public confidence in our system is critical as well.\"\nCriminal lawyer Bob Buckingham criticized Parsons's tweet, saying it undermined the legitimacy of the jury process.\n@Andrew_Parsons1 This was a jury verdict. Ur statement undermines jury system. As Minister you shud be defending process. #justice\n— @WeMakeJustice \"I think that's quite a narrow view,\" Parsons said Monday on the Corner Brook Morning Show . \"You have to take what Mr. Buckingham says with a grain of salt perhaps, given that he ran for an opposing party in the last election. There may be a partisan side to it.\"\nDuty to ask questions Parsons said his tweet was not meant to disagree with the jury's not guilty verdict, but that as minister he has a responsibility to ensure there is public confidence in the justice system.\n\"When I sit back and see people protesting, it's my job to ask questions as well,\" he said.\n\"I hear what the public is saying, and there's a lot of upset out there and we have to continue on and not be afraid to ask questions.\"\nRoyal Newfoundland Constabulary Const.

(Glenn Payette/CBC)\nParsons said the justice system should be able to withstand the rigours of public questioning and scrutiny, and that both the public and the justice department should be allowed to look at a verdict with a critical eye.\nConfidence in police Besides some loss of confidence in the judicial process, Parsons is also hearing about loss of faith in the RNC following the Snelgrove verdict.\nHe doesn't want to go into specifics about Snelgrove's future with the force, as the RNC's disciplinary process has to run its course to determine whether having sex with the woman while on duty was unethical.\nComplaint process for Doug Snelgrove underway after not guilty verdict Protest follows not guilty verdict in RNC officer Doug Snelgrove sexual assault trial Parsons said he still has faith in the RNC to serve and protect.\n\"We can't let the actions of one tarnish the actions of many,\" he said. \"But we will not tolerate unethical behaviour, especially from those who are in positions of power.\"\nWith files from Corner Brook Morning Show", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/justice?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/Andrew_Parsons1", "https://twitter.com/WeMakeJustice/status/835536990498091008"], "published": "2017-02-27T18:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:45:28.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
