It tells about the Jewish people coming 4,000 years ago. The Arabs only came about 1,000 years ago!\" Infographic: Israeli settlements in the West Bank (UN OCHA) \nDr Ben-Artzi hopes Donald Trump's election will bring a new era of settlement expansion will make it impossible for a Palestinian state to ever be created on this land. \n\"We hope that in the time of Trump people will stop talking about that stupid and crazy idea of two sate solution which is absolutely impossible,\" he tells the ABC. \n\"There's one state in the land of Israel and that's the state of Israel.\" \nFor the people of Beit El, the election of Mr Trump is hugely exciting. \nMr Trump's personal foundation has donated $10,000 to this settlement, while the man the US President has appointed to be America's Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, chairs one of Beit El's biggest fundraising efforts in the US. \n\"Mr Freidman is a friend of Beit El. He donated money to Beit El. He came to visit Beit El,\" Dr Ben-Artzi explains. \n\"He is also a good friend of the settlement movement.\" \nFor the past eight years, Barack Obama's opposition to settlements and the pressure his administration placed on the Israeli Government meant it was difficult to obtain building permits here. \nNow in Beit El, there's hope temporary housing will soon be replaced by a building boom. \n\"People had to live in these caravan, trailers,\" Dr Ben-Artzi says, pointing at several rows of demountable buildings. \n\"We hope that in the time of the new president, President Trump, they should be able to build normal houses.\" 'Hilltops confiscated by the settlers' Photo: Issa Amro, who runs the NGO Youth Against Settlements. (ABC News) \nFor Palestinians, the expansion of Israeli settlements across the West Bank has had a daily impact on their lives. \n\"Everywhere in the West Bank you find settlements and the settlements are completely restricting the movement of the Palestinians between their own cities and one town and another,\" says Issa Amro. \nA human rights activist from Hebron, Mr Amro runs the NGO Youth Against Settlements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:47:57.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
