Live updates Sort posts by 11:22am \nOne thing that might work against La La Land is the fact it seems to have divided audiences. It's the most commercially successful of this year's best picture nominees, having grossed $369 million worldwide, but not all those paying customers have loved it as much as I did. In fact, there seems to be a pattern here: people who grew up loving 1950s MGM musicals don't rate it so highly – how many times have you heard \"Ryan Gosling is no Gene Kelly\"? – but people who don't necessarily love musicals love this one. \nThat suggests the vote for best picture could be split. And if so, that could be good news for Lion . I suspect Moonlight is too niche, Manchester by the Sea too difficult for either to garner a majority of the vote in this category. But Lion is a well-made, intensely moving film that leaves people feeling uplifted. It ticks a lot of boxes. \nIn short, while I suspect La La Land is going to be hard to beat, if any film has a chance I reckon it's Lion . 1 of the best crowd-pleasers I've shown this yr @ my Michigan theater is \"Lion.\" It's the kind of film ppl keep saying \"make more of these!\" — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) February 27, 2017 11:15am La La Land, the record? \nLa La Land has a record-equalling 14 nominations this year – the same as All About Eve in 1950 and Titanic in 1997 – but I doubt it's going to win them all. In fact, it can't win them all: two of those nominations are in the same category, best song. So that's 13 at best. \nBut I can't see it winning best actor for Ryan Gosling, and Emma Stone is an outside chance at most for best actress. \nMy guess is it will fall well short of the record 11 wins (for Ben Hur in 1959, Titanic in 1997, and Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2003). The technical categories can be a bit hard to pick, but I'm going to take a stab and predict La La Land will win seven. \nIf I'm right, just remember you read it here first. If I'm wrong, do us both a favour and forget I said it, OK?

I suspect that's come too late for him to be included in the In Memoriam segment but we'll see soon enough. He will surely get a mention early on in proceedings though.
