According to residents, government forces blasted the house with explosives.\nAs the fighting raged, clashes erupted between security forces and neighboring villagers who tried to march to Frisal in solidarity with militants. Troops fired tear gas canisters to stop the rock-throwing protesters.\nMilitants fighting against Indian rule have wide support among Kashmir’s Muslims, who often protest in the streets during security operations to help militants escape.\nKashmir is divided between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan. Both counties claim the disputed territory in its entirety.\nRebels have been fighting against Indian rule since 1989. More than 68,000 people have been killed in the uprising and Indian military crackdown.\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
