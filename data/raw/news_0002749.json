It's an equally luxurious three-bedroom penthouse downtown on Second Avenue.\nThe Puget Sound Business Journal first reported the penthouse was on the market earlier this week. It has been listed for four days at $13.8 million, putting it just behind this historic neo-classical revival on Capitol Hill and this literal castle in Laurelhurst.\nBut in terms of price per square foot, it takes the cake: It comes in at $2,408 per square foot, putting it well ahead of the Capitol Hill home ($1,364) and the Laurelhurst home ($1,937).\nThe unit is undeniably stunning, said Scott Wasner, a founding director with Realogics Sotheby's.\n\"The view is unparalleled -- from the Space Needle to the Sound and everything in between. [It] makes this home extremely unique,\" he said.\nMoira E. Holley, also a founding director at Realogics Sotheby's and Wasner's wife, is the home's listing agent. She told the PSBJ that this is the most expensive condo she has seen on the market since she started selling Seattle real estate in 1992.\nRelated Stories Trump Island in San Juans listed for $8.7M Gorgeous $7.5M brick home on Capitol Hill 2 stunning San Juan Island estates for sale The penthouse has tasteful, contemporary style and features walls of windows that wrap around the home from the kitchen and into the living room. All three bedrooms (and the master bathroom) have views of the Space Needle. The home has a massive roof terrace with views of downtown Seattle, Mount Rainier and the Great Wheel.\nThe home was a collaboration between interior designer Gregory Carmichael and architect Rick Sundberg. Carmichael is a renowned designer known for his work in luxury homes around the Northwest, while Sundberg is a prolific architect known for his work designing buildings on the campuses of Whatcom Community College, Seattle University School of Law and the University of Washington.\nYou can see the full listing here.\nItâ€™s called the Penthouse in the Sky, and boasts sweeping views over Manchester and beyond with floor-to-ceiling windows.\nMedia: MediaOS Video", "external_links": ["http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2017/01/30/patti-paynes-cool-pads-bay-vista-penthouse.html", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/56/56/42/12249219/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/56/62/63/12266708/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/56/47/61/12221512/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.rsir.com/eng/sales/detail/286-l-638-hjr3eq/2821-2nd-avenue-2301-seattle-wa-98121"], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:58:36.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
