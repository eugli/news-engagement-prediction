Mirai gets its first Windows version \nOne of the recent developments on the Mirai malware front was discovered by Russian cyber-security firm Dr.Web, whose experts came across a Windows trojan built with the sole purpose of helping Mirai spread to even more devices. \nStandard Mirai versions work by infecting a device, selecting a random IP address and attempting to log in via the Telnet port using a list of default admin credentials. Subsequent versions added the option to launch these password guessing attacks via SSH ports. \nIn all of this process, the Mirai self-spreading behavior was contained to devices running various versions of the Linux operating systems only. \nThe trojan discovered by Dr.Web (detected as Trojan.Mirai.1 ) helps crooks launch the password-guessing attacks from Windows devices, even if Mirai itself (detected as Linux.Mirai) won't be able to run on Windows. \nIf the Windows trojan infects another Windows device, then that device is used as another point to launch the password-guessing attacks. New Mirai Windows version targets even more ports \nUnder the hood, the Mirai Windows trojan works by infecting a device, where it contacts an online C&C server and downloads a list of IP addresses. \nIn the same way as the original Mirai trojan, the Windows variant attempts to log into the devices at the end of those IPs via a series of ports. Unlike the Linux version, the Windows trojan targets more ports. 22 - Telnet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:07:14.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
