But it has left players like Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jack Wilshere and Kieran Gibbs uncertain over their futures as they have just 18 months left on their deals. \nThey are being kept in the dark while Arsenal look to resolve Wenger’s future and the contract situations with Sanchez and Ozil. \nSenior players still hold the Frenchman in the highest regard and respect him as a nice man and good manager. But they simply do not do as much work on tactics or preparation as some other big clubs, and they were horribly exposed by Bayern.

I don’t want him to be remembered for these last few years at the club. It’s nasty now. \n\"He has been magnificent for the club, absolutely amazing. But he should come out now, say he will see out his contract and then everyone will get behind him and the team and give him the send off that he deserves.” \nWenger’s unwavering loyalty to his players is another major issue. \nHe is close to N’Golo Kante’s agent and a deal was there to be done last summer, but he baulked at paying a big commission fee and the fact the France midfielder wanted wages of £200,000-a-week.

Kante ended up at Chelsea instead, and they now top the Premier League. \nMeanwhile, Arsenal’s big midfield signing of the last off-season, £30m Granit Xhaka is seen as “bang-average” in the eyes of some. \nThere is also a feeling that it is far too comfortable at Arsenal’s state-of-the-art training ground. \nThey had a players’ meeting after the Chelsea defeat and Mirror Sport understands there was barely a raised voice, just a run-of-the-mill post-match inquest. \nSome players want rollickings and rows to clear the air, but Wenger does not like confrontation. Is the atmosphere at Arsenal's training-ground too light-hearted?
