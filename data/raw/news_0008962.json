FLYWEIGHT KING \nIn fact, the current pound-for-pound number one is so dominant in his division that many are calling for a super fight at bantamweight instead.

Article continues below Marcelo abused for not wishing Cristiano happy birthday - reacts brilliantly \nThat was until a spanner in the form of Cody Garbrandt was thrown into the works, who upset the odds and snatched the bantamweight crown from Cruz in December. \nNow, the super fight that makes sense is if Johnson moves up to bantamweight to take on No Love. \nSpeaking to NESN , Mighty Mouse revealed he’s open to the bout, and the only incentive he needs to make it happen is money. INCENTIVE \nHe said: “Yeah, definitely. \n“If the money’s right. It’s always about the money aspect of it, you know? \n“I need to have an incentive to go up and do it, you know?” \nJohnson is never one to back down from a challenge, but Cruz also feels he deserves an immediate rematch. \nGarbrandt, on the other hand, has been vocal about wanting Conor McGregor in another super fight. \nThat does look unlikely, and with T.J. Dillashaw in the mix, you can expect Mighty Mouse to sit back, break some records and watch which one of the three can come out of the other end as the champion before stepping up. \nWould you like to see Demetrious Johnson take on Cody Garbrandt in a super fight?
