It is not designed to address complex emissions control systems in new vehicles. This cannot screen inherent technical flaws and frauds for which manufacturers are responsible that compromise the emissions performance in the real world. \n\nThe key highlights of the CSE analysis: \n\nVery poor PUC compliance and ineffective tests \n\nThe PUC system, the only system to check emissions from on-road vehicles in India is extremely weak in terms of lax norms, poor enforcement and poor quality test procedures. New data from the Delhi Transport Department shows that failure rate is as dismal as 5 per cent - nearly all vehicles pass the test. There is no data, however, on how many vehicles show up for the test. \n\nThe PUC norms for on-road vehicles are extremely lax for the older pre-Bharat stage IV vehicles. While under PUC, petrol cars are tested for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons along with lambda (that indicates the optimum condition needed for proper functioning of catalytic converters), diesel vehicles are tested only for smoke density. While all norms are lax, those for on-road diesel vehicles are particularly lenient - smoke density norms are 50 HSU only for the Bharat Stage IV-compliant diesel vehicles. For pre-BS-IV vehicles, the norm is as lax as 65 HSU. In Singapore and Pakistan, this norm is 40 HSU; in Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong and Malaysia it is 50 HSU for all genre of vehicles. \n\nThis is a serious issue at a time when Delhi, which already has more than 614 PUC centres, is trying set up more. This investment can go waste without an effective system in place. \n\n\n\n\nSerious concern over quality of checks in PUC centres \n\nThe Supreme Court has recently given directions to the EPCA to audit all the 614 PUC stations. There are serious concerns over quality and credibility of PUC tests across the cities. In fact, a detailed audit that was carried out by the Central Pollution Control Board in 2013 in 76 PUC centres exposed serious anomalies - non-compliance with the code of practice; unavailability of calibration certificate for testing instruments in several centres; poor condition of laboratory; leak test failure; and non-functioning analysers. This clearly brings out the ineffectiveness of the programme. \n\n\n\n\nSmoke density test under PUC cannot check particulate emissions \n\nThe smoke test was introduced in the 1960s to reduce the visibility problems due to diesel smoke. There is no real correlation between smoke density and particle emissions. Smoke is not a good surrogate for tiny particles. There can be a risk of misclassifying polluters - low smoke emissions can also mean high particulate emissions. Even in Europe, virtually no vehicle fails the smoke test. Other governments including ones in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, the US, etc now conduct these tests on chassis dynamometer to simulate speed. This makes the emissions test more rigorous. China is further developing a nationwide I/M system for evaluating NOx emissions from in-use HDVs. \n\nTests are needed to prevent emissions frauds or poor emissions performance of advanced emissions control systems on roads - especially diesel vehicles \n\nThe PUC system is not even designed to test tiny particles and NOx on road - the key concerns from diesel vehicles. Volkswagen was caught cheating on NOx emissions. In fact, too much focus on reducing smoke can actually increase NOx emissions as a trade-off. But new generation diesel vehicles will come with advanced emissions control systems to reduce particulate and NOx. If these systems perform sub-optimally, there can be uncontrolled emissions. \n\nThe fact that India is totally unprepared to prevent emissions frauds and underperformance of emissions control systems on roads was proved a few years ago when the Tavera fraud case of General Motors was exposed. These models passed the certification tests with one set of engines that did not the match those actually sold in the market. But this incident did not lead to any major reform to establish in-use compliance norms and monitoring in India. \n\nThe Indian government does not have the power to penalise manufacturers for non-compliance and violation. This has serious implications as the next level of Euro V and Euro VI standards will require advanced particulate traps and NOx control systems like SCR to cut toxic diesel emissions. If engineering deficiency reduces the effectiveness of these systems or if these are not properly operated like urea refilling in SCR system, it can lead to uncontrolled emissions and nullify pollution control measures in our cities. \n\nIndia has already specified more advanced On Board Diagnostic Systems in post-2013 vehicles. This should be integrated with vehicle inspection programme for more effective monitoring. \n\nIf a problem or malfunction is detected, the OBD II system illuminates a warning light on the vehicle instrument panel to alert the driver. This warning light will typically display the phrase \"Check Engine\" or \"Service Engine Soon,\" and will often include an engine symbol. The OBD system stores important information about any detected malfunction so that a repair technician can accurately find and fix the problem. It is notified to monitor catalyst, fuel injection system, particulate trap, coolant temperature, EGR, fuel system, emission control systems, etc. \n\nSmog-check inspections in USA for post-2000 model vehicles are now primarily based on an inspection of the OBD II system - tailpipe testing is no longer required. It identifies emission-related components covered under warranty, eliminates unnecessary repairs, and gives information about area of malfunction or a specific component. This reduces cost of warranty repairs and ensures customer satisfaction, allows early detection of malfunctions etc. But this system will require strong surveillance and appropriate software to work effectively. \n\n\n\n\nAuto company and its accountability \n\nIndia also needs strong compliance regulations to make manufacturers responsible for on-road emissions performance for a vehicle's useful life on road \n\nConsistent with the global best practices, India needs an independent authority to check emissions against standards; issue recall of vehicles by companies if they are found non-compliant; levy fines on defaulting companies; and withdraw approval of sale if vehicles do not conform with the stated emissions targets. An independent authority should monitor this process without being influenced by industry. Only such a system will make non-compliance with regulations more expensive for companies than compliance with regulations and ensure implementation. The Auto Fuel Policy committee has recommended an emissions warranty and recall programme and in-use compliance regulations. But this has not been implemented. \n\nCSE's review shows that currently, Indian certification agencies do not select vehicle samples for certification tests randomly and independently. In fact, certification agencies give prior notice to manufacturers about the approximate time during which samples will be collected from a given lot. This compromises independent and impartial testing. Legal procedures for the MoRTH to issue mandatory recalls or levy fines have not been established yet. \n\nMoreover, there is no system post-sales (as in the US) to allow testing agencies to select any vehicle, anywhere, and at any time, without prior notice to the manufacturer. India urgently needs rules for the government and manufacturers to remove non-compliant vehicles. A mandatory recall policy for non-compliant vehicles is needed to ensure that manufacturers design vehicles to comply with emission standards for the duration of their useful life. \n\nIn fact, China has taken steps to move in this direction. China has recently revised its programmes to allow the selection of vehicles at random without any prior notice. Furthermore, COP testing in China is now corroborated through inter-laboratory round-robin testing, which adds an additional level of scrutiny. \n\n\n\n\nDefeating defeat devices \n\nCSE investigations have also shown that defeat devices are being sold openly in the global market. For instance, Adblue OBD2 Emulator that disables selective catalytic reducing (SCR) system needed to control NOx from diesel vehicles is being openly sold in the global market. People use this to avoid recurring cost of urea refill in SCRs. In countries like Brazil only 46 per cent of the diesel vehicles have working SCRs - rest have been disabled. India therefore needs defeat device regulations as those that exist in countries like the US. \n\nThe road ahead: \n\nIndia will be in deep trouble if massive motorisation happens without strong compliance with emissions limits. This will enhance the public health risk. \n\n* Strengthen PUC norms and testing for older vehicles. Ensure 100 per cent compliance by linking annual insurance with PUC certificates. \n\n* Overhaul emissions tests for diesel vehicles to enable monitoring of particulate and NOx emissions. \n\n* Integrate OBD with the inspection and maintenance programme. Ensure its software is not manipulated. \n\n* Need immediate technical preparedness to implement Real Driving Emissions Test Procedures and Standards based on portable emissions monitoring system with a small margin for deterioration. \n\n* Ensure unbiased and independent type approval tests for vehicle certification by the test agencies. \n\n* Need defeat device regulations: Prevent use of defeat devices like SCR disablers that are being openly sold in the global market. \n\n* Industry should be mandated to declare actual certification emissions data, real world emissions data and allow free access.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:45:22.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
