Golden State Warriors teammates Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant were named Co-Players of the Month in the Western Conference. \nThomas certainly is deserving of the honor, as he averaged a league-high 32.9 points per game during a historic January . He also tallied 6.9 assists per game, shot 49.7 percent from the floor and 43.2 percent from 3-point range. \nThe 5-foot-9 point guard scored 20 points or more in all 14 of his team’s January games, notching at least 35 points in eight of those games and topping the 40-point mark twice. The Celtics went 10-4 in that span. \nThomas has done most of his damage in the fourth quarter , where he’s averaging an NBA-best 10.5 points per game. The 27-year-old capped the month off with a 41-points effort in a win over the Detroit Pistons in which he scored a season-high 24 points in the final 12 minutes. \nThomas is the first Celtic to win Player of the Month since Paul Pierce in March 2012. \nThumbnail photo via Winslow Townson/USA TODAY Sports Images \nHave a question for Darren Hartwell?
