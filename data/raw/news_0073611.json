Zlatan Ibrahimovic's hat-trick and the battle between the Pogba brothers dominated the first-leg headlines on a night when the margin of victory flattered Jose Mourinho's side. The United manager criticised his players' first-half approach as Les Verts scared the hosts on several occasions last Thursday - something Galtier is confident his side can do again. St Etienne boss Christophe Galtier insists the second leg is not a dead rubber Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a hat-trick at Old Trafford in the first encounter between the sides The odds on St Etienne overturning the 3-0 loss and progressing from Wednesday's second leg are as long as 40-1, yet their manager has not given up hope. 'There is no need for hyper motivation,' Galtier told reporters. 'We have a huge but not insurmountable handicap. We will play in another big atmosphere. The stadium will be full.
