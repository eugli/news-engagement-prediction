Stars and celebrities lent a big hand to the #SagerStrong Foundation on Saturday at #NBAAllStar Weekend! pic.twitter.com/RrFlml2449 \n— NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) February 19, 2017 \nThe group amassed a total of $130,000, and Steph Curry was then given the chance to bump the total up to $500,000 by hitting a shot from halfcourt. \nThere was just one problem: Curry missed, repeatedly. After bricking nine heaves from the center of the court, Sager’s son Ryan was given the chance to make a shot to hit the $500,000 mark. He got a little help from Shaq.
