Inside that cold, dark container, a small green face pokes out of a hand of bananas. \nIt's a frog, stowed away with the tropical fruit, and it will never return to its home. \nArthur White, the president of the Frog and Tadpole Study Group of NSW, has been studying frogs all his life. He's one of the people behind a pioneering frog rescue service. \n\"We knew that frogs were being moved around all the time,\" he says. \n\"Even as young kids, just in the local markets, you'd go down to the produce store and they'd often have frogs in the back of the sheds that'd come down on trucks. \n\"But we never realised quite how significant the problem was until we got into the 1970s and 80s, which is when the big frog declines were starting to occur.\" \nFrog populations across the world had plummeted, and scientists were working fast to work out why.

(ABC RN: Ann Jones) \nAs a precaution, NSW introduced a policy of euthanasing frogs that arrived from interstate or overseas. \n\"There was a suspicion that it was disease related, so a lot of the rules that had been brought in about having to kill frogs that had come from unknown provenances were really a protective measure to try and control unwanted diseases,\" says Dr White. \nThe Frog and Tadpole Study Group negotiated with the authorities to pick up stowaway frogs and put them into quarantine.

(ABC RN: Ann Jones) \n\"Basically any frogs that went through quarantine were treated for diseases like frog chytrid disease,\" Dr White says. \n\"If they came out of quarantine, and appeared to be OK, we could them make them available for captive care. They could never be released. \n\"When the Frog and Tadpole Study Group started up the frog rescue service, 95 per cent of the frogs that we received were coming from Queensland in hands of bananas. \n\"The most common species is the dainty green tree frog. It's a beautiful frog, but for some reason it just loves crawling in among the bananas on the tree.\" \nNorthern laughing tree frogs and the little red tree frogs are also common. \nThe frogs shelter in the bananas during the day and come out at night to feed, particularly if the trees are in blossom. \nMany bananas are picked green and then artificially ripened at production centres using ethylene gas. \n\"Prior to the frog rescue service, the hands of bananas were going into the ethylene rooms with the frogs in them,\" says Dr White. \"And of course, the frogs would get gassed as well. \n\"That's another reason why we were keen to kick this process off and intercept the frogs before they actually got into that processing part of the train. All sorts of things can happen to them from then on, they can just be accidentally squashed too, in the handling.

(ABC RN: Ann Jones) \nBut it's not just bananas the frogs stow away with. \n\"We get lots of little dainty green tree frogs with the cut flower trade,\" says Dr White. \"We also get quite a few of them in the cooler months of the year from lettuces and cabbages.\" \nWorking with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and growers, the frog rescue program has managed to dramatically reduce the number of stowaway frogs. \n\"The main reason we don't get as many banana box frogs now is that the banana growers themselves have actually changed their processing methods,\" says Dr White. \n\"The hands of bananas, once they're cut, get inspected at the source before they then get loaded and sent down to Sydney. So that's great. \n\"That is a far better result, as far as I'm concerned, than having to retrieve frogs, run them through the frog rescue service, then farm them out as pets.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:08:33.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
