So where to go to get some of that prime scenery? Here are five of the most beautiful multi-day bike rides in the country, from the Florida Keys to the Colorado Rockies. San Juan Islands, Washington \nFive awesome multi-day bike rides include the San Juan Islands.

You can take a ferry from Anacortes, on the mainland, and then ferry-hop between the four biggest islands — San Juan, Orcas, Lopez and Shaw — for free. Mt. Constitution, on Orcas Island, will give you the most expansive view, and there are plenty of sandy beaches to visit. \nDepending on the time of year, you can see whales migrating in the Straits of Juan de Fuca. Limekiln State Park is a prime spot for whale watching, and you can camp there for free, too. Route 100, Vermont \nRoute 100, Vermont.

You’ll pass by classic Vermont landmarks, like the Ben & Jerry’s factory, and there are lots of good swimming holes to hit along the way. It’s at its most beautiful (and most crowded) in the fall. Black Hills, South Dakota \nIf Annie Oakley rode a bike, she would have done it in Black Hills, South Dakota.

The Keys, Florida \nThe Florida Keys, best done from the top down.

You’ll get all the weird and wonderful parts of south Florida — wildlife, beaches, history — and you end up in Key West, so you have a built-in welcome party. Because of the prevailing wind, it’s much more pleasant to do the ride north to south instead of the other way around. \nRELATED: Dive into these epic adventures in Florida San Juan Huts, Colorado \nLooking for an extended multi-day mountain bike trip? You can ride through the San Juan Huts system from Telluride, Colorado, to Moab, Utah. The 215-mile trip takes seven days, but it’s worth the time because it encompasses a wide variety of riding, from high alpine trails to desert slickrock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:48:07.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
