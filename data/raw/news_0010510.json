Some travellers boarding US-bound flights were turned back, crowds of hundreds of people packed into arrival areas to protest and legal objections were filed across the US. \nThe order also temporarily stopped the entry of all refugees into the country and indefinitely halted the settlement of Syrian refugees. \nOn Friday the Department of Homeland Security issued additional clarification of the order, stating that there were no plans to extend it beyond the seven countries. The DHS also reiterated that the ban did not apply to permanent residents, or green card holders, and some others, such as those who have helped the US military. \nThe block comes as it's been revealed a former prime minister of Norway - a US ally - was detained in Washington this week because he had taken a trip to Iran in 2014. \nKjell Magne Bondevik, an ordained Lutheran minister travelled to the US for the National Prayer Breakfast event headlined by Trump on Thursday. He has travelled to and from the US on numerous occasions. \nHis office contacted the US Embassy in Oslo prior to him travelling, and was told his passport and a separate electronic travel authorisation - a visa waver - would be enough for entry into the country. \nBut after flying into Dulles International Airport Tuesday afternoon, he was detained and questioned for about an hour. His passport - which clearly stated he is the former prime minister of Norway - indicated he been to Iran, where Bondevik said he had attended a human rights conference. \n\"I was surprised, and I was provoked,\" he told WJLA ABC7. \"What will the reputation of the US be if this happens not only to me, but also to other international leaders?\" \nBondevik contacted the Norwegian Embassy in Washington after he was detained, he said. A spokesperson said the embassy was \"happy that things were sorted out.\" \nHe was placed in a room with travellers from the Middle East and Africa who also faced extra scrutiny, and had to wait for about 40 minutes before being questioned for about 20 minutes, he said. Officials asked him why he had been in Iran and why he was coming to the US, he told Norway's TV2, according to English-language news outlet the Local. \n\"There should be no reason to fear a former prime minister who has been on official visits to the country several times before,\" Bondevik said. \"It appears that when the name of a certain country shows up, all of the antennas go up. This will create totally unnecessary suspicion.\" \nBondevik said his detention was prompted not by President Donald Trump's recent executive order, but by a policy instated under President Obama, which calls for extra restrictions on some citizens from 38 countries - including Norway. Exemptions for travel for diplomatic or military purposes exist. \nStill, Bondevik was shocked, he said, particularly because this was not his first visit to the US since his trip to Iran in 2014. A spokesperson with US Customs and Border Protection said the agency is prohibited by privacy laws from discussing specifics of any individual's admissibility review,\" ABC7 reported. \n\"I understand the fear of terror, but one should not treat entire ethnic groups in such a way,\" he said, the Local reported. \"I must admit that I fear the future. There has been a lot of progress over the last 10 years, but this gives great cause for concern, in line with the authoritarian leaders we see controlling other major countries.\" \nBondevik served as the Christian Democratic Party prime minister of Norway from 1997 to 2000 and from 2001 to 2005, making him Norway's longest serving non-Socialist prime minister since World War II. \nReuters, Washington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:53:14.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
