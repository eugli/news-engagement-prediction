Rec There was a very unusual and odd sequence during the game between the Bulls and Kings that ended with DeMarcus Cousins shoving a Chicago assistant coach. Bulls' Taj Gibson gets technical foul; Kings' DeMarcus Cousins and Matt Barnes make contact with Bulls assistant coach during aftermath pic.twitter.com/bVjp4feRiA — Ben Golliver (@BenGolliver) February 7, 2017 It’s not out of the ordinary to see tempers flare in a NBA game. But, it is weird when the tempers flare on both sides and none of it is between the players. This sequence starts out innocently enough. Chicago’s Taj Gibson thought he was fouled on a layup attempt and appeared to say something. The referee didn’t like it and gave Gibson a technical. Gibson and Rajon Rondo then started arguing the call. They did so aggressively enough that Bulls assistant Jim Boylen came over to try and separate the players from the referees. It appears Boylen inadvertently made contact with Barnes, who didn’t appreciate it. Cousins then got involved too and shoved Boylen. The Kings players walked off without further incident while the Bulls continued to argue with the refs. Cousins was ejected later in the game for arguing an unrelated play with officials. So there you have it. A near-scuffle in a NBA game with zero players angry at other players.
