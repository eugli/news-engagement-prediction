We usually hear of it in terms of light, but it is the basis of all electromagnetic radiation. \nWhere radar sends out a beam of photons as radio waves, quantum radar uses entangled photons. \nPut simply, entangled photons are two separate photons that share a deep quantum link. The upshot is the photons mirror each other’s behaviour when one of them is influenced in some way. \nIn terms of radar, a crystal can be used to ‘split’ such entangled photons and cast one into the sky. \nFor a time at least, the twin photons retain their ‘spooky’ link — mirroring the same responses to the environment the other encounters. \nIt’s a quirk of quantum physics which strained the understanding of Albert Einstein when he grappled with the idea in the 1930s. \nQuantum radar would send out bursts of photons while retaining their ‘pairs’. The changes in behaviour of the retained photon would then reveal what’s happening to the photon in the beam. \nUltimately, the point is the same: the entangled photons bounce back to a sensor which can then compute course, speed and size. \nBut the use of tangled photons has a second major benefit over radio waves. \nIt’s not likely to be jammed. The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II banks hard at the Farnborough Airshow, south west of London, last year. Quantum radar appears impossible to jam or confuse. Picture: AFP Source: AFP \nUNBREAKABLE LOCK \nApart from absorbing or reflecting away its radio beams, conventional radar can also be jammed by transmitting ‘white noise’ on the same frequencies. \nThis isn’t possible with entangled photons. \nWhile the photons are separated by their beam, they retain their quantum link. \nAttempting to break that link would be a giveaway. And any attempt to distort the behaviour of one of the pair would be equally noticeable. \nThe same applies to advanced materials. \nWhere modern composites can ‘trap’ radio waves within their molecular structure, whatever happens to an entangled photon would be replicated — and measured — in its paired mate back at the radar site. \nAnd different materials affect protons in different ways. \nBecause of this, analysts say quantum radar could ultimately be capable of determining what an aircraft is made of — or even carrying. \nAt one level this would eliminate the effectiveness of decoys. At another, it could identify which aircraft — or missile — is carrying nuclear warheads. \nAnd, unlike existing radar, their transmissions would not be detectable. \nAny stealth aircraft would not know it had been ‘seen’. An F-35 undergoes operational testing aboard a US Marine amphibious assault carrier last year. The stealth fighter’s abilities are limited by the need for stealth.

But all this was justified on the basis that its design was optimised to be invisible to radar. \nTake that invisibility away and the F-35 looks much less capable than its counterparts. One of Australia’s first F-35 Strike Fighters displays its RAAF markings. Losing its ability to fly ‘unseen’ will leave the fighter vulnerable. Picture: Defence Source: Supplied \nREALITY CHECK \nDespite the ominous sounding properties of this unbeatable radar, the foibles of quantum mechanics make the actual exploitation of such technology incredibly difficult. \nPhoton pairs degrade. The longer one photon remains in the outside environment, the more stress is placed on the link with its partner. It’s called quantum decoherence. \nThis has implications for a quantum radar’s maximum range: keeping the photons paired for the time it takes one to cover 100km represents an enormous technical challenge. \nMaker of the F-35 Lockheed Martin has itself been attempting to develop the new technology over the past decade. Its progress remains unreported. \nBeijing media asserts successful tests of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC) quantum radar has produced results “500 per cent” better than Western examples. \nThe truth of this is likely to remain unknown for some considerable time, given the defence and corporate secrecy attached to such projects.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:20:50.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
