You want to pick on Kim? Don’t you bother. I had hoped we had a little something here but you’re a nasty b***h of a girl, you’re a saddo. Don’t start with me, you haven’t got the strength.\" Kim exploded at Nicola tonight (Photo: Channel 5) Nicola remained silent as Kim screamed at her (Photo: Channel 5) \nThen, addressing Nicola and Bianca Gascoigne , she said: “You silly b***ches. You stupid b***ches. You start on me, I’ll start on you. You don’t like it do you? Tough!” \nBig Brother then called Kim to the Diary Room where she continued to rant about Nicola, saying: “I don’t want trouble but Nicola thrives on it, there’s something wrong with her.” \nThe trouble all started when the housemates were shown clips of things they’d all said about each other in the house - it led Bianca to see Kim’s remark about Jamie O’Hara being an “adulterer.” \nBianca was furious and Nicola backed her up. Nicola refused to retaliate (Photo: Channel 5) Kim called Nicola \"filth\" (Photo: Channel 5) \nNicola told Kim it wasn’t cool to bring up someone’s past in the house, while Bianca said: “That was uncalled for and a little bit below the belt, shall we say.” \nKim, however, stood her ground, shouting at Bianca: “Your boyfriend two-timed his wife with three children. Saying he had to pay his wife a lot of money and he shouldn’t have to.” \nShe then branded Nicola “dirty” and said: “[I heard Jamie say] that his wife was getting too much money off him and [Nicola] turned around and said, ‘That’s what she married him for.’ You don’t know why she married him, you have no right to stir the pot. It was cruel of you.” \nNicola said: “I was at their wedding, Kim.” \n“Filth!” shouted Kim. Bianca was unhappy about Kim's comment about Jamie Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:50:59.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
