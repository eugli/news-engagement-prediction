Jeff Kravitz via Getty Images Dev and Anita Patel on the Oscars red carpet \nThe ‘Lion’ actor was photographed on the red carpet with his mother, Anita Patel, a carer, who looked totally thrilled to be joining her son at the Academy Awards. \nHe told Sky on the red carpet: “This film [’Lion’] is about mothers and sons and the strength of that love. She’s more than deserving of being here... more than me, actually.” Jeff Kravitz via Getty Images Already our favourite image from this year's red carpet \nDev wasn’t the only star to arrive with his mum in tow, with ‘Hamilton’ creator Lin-Manuel Miranda also being joined at the event by his beloved mother, Luz Towns-Miranda. \nLin-Manuel is nominated at this year’s Oscars for his offering in the latest Disney film, ‘Moana’, the heartfelt ballad ‘How Far We’ll Go’, which is battling against big numbers from ‘La La Land’ and, indeed, ‘Trolls’ in the category of Best Original Song.

ANGELA WEISS via Getty Images D'awww \nLucas is up for Best Supporting Actor thanks to his performance as Patrick Chandler in ‘Manchester By The Sea’, so you can bet that he could have had his pick of dates for the evening. \nHowever, he instead chose to attend with his mother, Susan Bruce Titman, who couldn’t resist planting a smacker on his cheek as they posed for photographers.
