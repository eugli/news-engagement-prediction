Young people, faces pressed against the estate agent's window, trying and failing to find a home they can afford. \n\"With prices continuing to sky rocket, if we don't act now, a whole generation could be left behind. We need to do better, and that means tackling the failures at every point in the system. \n\"The only way to halt the decline in affordability and help more people onto the housing ladder is to build more homes. Let's get Britain building.\" \nThe white paper states that \"only in exceptional circumstances\" can local authorities alter Green Belt boundaries. \nA £3 billion home-building fund aims to help small firms as 60% of new dwellings are currently constructed by just ten companies. Sajid Javid wants to 'get Britain building' Credit: PA \nThe Communities Secretary said the fund will help build more than 25,000 new homes by 2020, and up to 225,000 in the long term by providing loans for small firms and custom builders. \nFrom next April a Lifetime ISA will be launched aimed at supporting younger adults to save flexibly for the long term by giving them a 25% bonus on up to £4,000 of savings a year. \nThe Government said the extra £1.4 billion announced in the Autumn Statement will boost the Affordable Homes Programme and initiatives like the Rent to Buy scheme. \nMinisters say they want more security for renters with longer-term tenancies in the private sector. \nThe white paper includes measures to more accurately reflect housing need in the future, giving councils revised powers to speed up the building of new homes, and to place developments where they are most needed. \nLabour's shadow housing minister John Healey said: \"The measures announced so far in Theresa May's long-promised housing white paper are feeble beyond belief. \n\"After seven years of failure and 1,000 housing announcements, the housing crisis is getting worse not better.\" Last updated Tue 7 Feb 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:24:15.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
