Sweden was one of the five.

The influx of people into the continent caused disputes amongst EU states over how to manage the flow. One of the solutions found by some states was not to allow migrants in. \nStockholm introduced identity checks for travelers from Denmark to Sweden in November 2015, as part of measures to reduce the flow of illegal migrants. Passengers boarding trains, ferries or buses bound for Sweden are required to show a passport or other form of ID in order to be allowed onboard. \nBut the controls created havoc at the border with many Scandinavians and Germans unable to travel to Sweden simply for forgetting their IDs at home. \nHH Ferries, which offers sea connections between Denmark and Sweden, had previously revealed that 98 percent of the entire flow of passengers prevented from boarding by security checks were forgetful Scandinavians. Others criticized the journey time which became longer due to the extra security measures.

Tourists could also travel unhindered by land in the zone. \nUnder EU rules, countries may put in place border controls for a maximum of two years, for periods of up to six months at a time of exceptional circumstances such as a terrorist threat.
