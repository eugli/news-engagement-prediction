McMaster The lieutenant general is replacing Michael Flynn as national security adviser. By Sara Clarke | Assistant Managing Editor Feb. 21, 2017, at 8:40 a.m. Cancel Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster listens as President Donald Trump announces that McMaster will be the new national security adviser. (Susan Walsh/AP) \n1. Herbert Raymond McMaster, known as \"H.R.,\" graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1984. In the mid-1990s, he worked as an assistant professor of history there. \n2. He received a Ph.D. in U.S. history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . He turned his thesis into \"Dereliction of Duty,\" a 1997 book critical of the country's leadership during the Vietnam War. \n3. McMaster is the first active-duty military officer in the national security adviser role since Gen. Colin Powell held the post during President Ronald Reagan's tenure, and he will remain on active duty. \n4. McMaster was among Time magazine's 100 most influential people in 2014. \n5. McMaster is a combat veteran who was awarded a Silver Star in the first Gulf War for his commanding of a tank during the Battle of 73 Easting. \n6. He was twice passed over for promotion to general before finally earning the rank; some say his outspokenness and questioning of authority led to the delay in his career advancement. \n7. McMaster and his wife, Kathleen Trotter McMaster, have three daughters. \n8. In Tom Clancy's book \"Armored Cav,\" McMaster said he met Kathleen in 1983 while he played rugby for the Army team. \n9. He was a national security affairs fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University from 2002 to 2003. \n10. In a 2013 talk, McMaster referenced TV's \"Seinfeld\" when explaining how to fight a ground war. \"The word 'decisive' can be problematic,\" McMaster said. \"You don't want it construed as the old rapid decisive operations, you know, which I liken to the George Costanza on 'Seinfeld' — 'Leave on an up note.' You know what I mean. Just go in, do a lot of damage and leave. What have you really achieved if you do that?\" Sara Clarke Assistant Managing Editor \nSara Clarke is assistant managing editor for special reports at U.S. News & World Report.
