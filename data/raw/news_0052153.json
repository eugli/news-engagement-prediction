They have no doctors and no food. There is no flour, no bulgur wheat, no rice, no milk, there is nothing to eat.” Watch | Iraqi forces battle their way towards Mosul airport 00:43 \nT he shortages have sent food prices spiraling and in the few places where markets are still open many families cannot afford to buy anything. In some areas there were reports of people eating cats to ward off hunger. \n\"What we're hearing from inside western Mosul right now is deeply concerning,” said Maurizio Crivallero, Save the Children’s director in Iraq. \n“Even when there is food available at the markets, people don't have any money left to buy it. Families and their children are on the brink of starvation.” \nSome residents compared the situation to the Syrian city of Madaya, where people in the rebel-held town starved to death while under siege from the Syrian regime.

More than half of those 750,000 people in the west of the city are younger than 18, according to Mercy Corps. \nIsil fighters have reportedly executed people caught trying to escape from their areas and fleeing towards Iraqi troops. Around 3,000 Isil troops are believed to still be inside Mosul although most of the senior leaders have fled into Syria. \nFighting in the city is focused around the ruined remains of Mosul International Airport, which Iraqi forces plan to seize before beginning their main drive into the remaining Isil areas. \nThe airport was opened to civilian traffic in 2007 after years of disuse under Saddam Hussein and during the Iraq war but shut when Isil seized control of the city in 2014. \nThe jihadists appear to have destroyed much of the airport during their two-year reign in Mosul, digging deep trenches across its two runways in an apparent effort to sabotage them and prevent them from being used in future. \nThe airport and a nearby military base will be used as staging bases for the thrust into western Mosul, the Iraqi military said.

One family claimed to have lost 11 members in the strike.
