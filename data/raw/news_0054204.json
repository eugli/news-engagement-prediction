Not a chance in hell. \n\"I will proudly stand up to any homophobe and say right to their face that I'm a proud, openly gay cowboy. \n\"It doesn't make you any less of a person nor, be it, a cowboy.” \nHe also emphasised the \"terrible problem\" with homophobia in rural areas of the country. \n\"Rural Australia has a terrible problem with homophobia and it needs to stop.\" \nMr Goyne’s video has already been viewed 23,000 times. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:25:02.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
