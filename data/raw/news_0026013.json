They threatened DSCC Mayor Khokon that they would complain to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. \nOn Thursday, the DSCC filed the three cases of extortion against the background of the hawkers’ movement. The case dossiers show that the charges of extortion were brought against the 72 following investigative reports carried by national dailies and ‘information and evidence provided by Kashem’.\nHawkers’ Federation President Kashem has admitted to helping DSCC file the cases by providing the information. \nHe told bdnews24.com on Friday night that five hawkers’ organisations had also provided information to DSCC. \n“The mayor sought lists of extortionists from the hawkers’ leaders during a meeting. Five registered organisations of the hawkers provided the lists. We actually provided the names published in newspapers,” he said. \nKashem, however, denied that the names of hawkers’ leaders had been included in the lists. \nHe said DSCC had named some hawkers’ leaders from the federation, who ‘joined the extortionists later’, after reviewing video footage of demonstration. \nBesides Abul Hossain, the hawkers’ leaders implicated in the cases include Hawkers’ Coordination Council leader Arif Chowdhury, Bangladesh Hawkers’ Union Advisers Sekendar Hayat, Abul Hashem Kabir, Muriskul Islam Shimul, Shafiqur Rahman Babul, Manjur Moin, Homeless Hawkers’ League General Secretary Khokon Majumder, and Homeless Hawkers’ Society leaders Khairul Bashar and Rafiqul Islam. \nArif Chowdhury said Kashem could not evade responsibility as their leader. “If we are extortionists, he (Kashem) is also an extortionist, having been the federation chief,” he said. \nThe hawkers alleged Kashem had embezzled several hundred thousand taka by providing ID cards to the hawkers at Tk 200 per head. \nDSCC official Muhammad Shamsul Alam, who initiated the cases with Motijheel, Paltan and Shahbagh Police Stations, did not reply to a question on whether the cases were based on information provided by Kashem. \nHe also did not reply when asked if the city corporation had checked the names before initiating the cases. \nbdnews24.com spoke to the hawkers in Gulistan, Paltan, Baitul Mukarram, Zero Point, and Bangabandhu Avenue from the afternoon to night on Thursday. \nThe hawkers identified many of the 72 accused as ‘extortionists’. \nThey include Khalil, Burha Salam, Sarder Salam, Akter, Jahangi’, Kala Nabi, Abdur Rob,‘Hasan, Shaheed, Khorshed alias Borho Mia, Bimol Babu, Shawkat Habib, Bhola, and Kana Siraj. \nThe hawkers could not identify many of the others. They said Lombu Shahjahan, Babul, Hindu Shaheen, and Ayub work as ‘lineman’, who collect edthe extortion from the hawkers on behalf of the main culprits.\nMany others implicated in the cases were identified as hawkers like Manik’, a hairdresser with a makeshift arrangement on the footpath. \nOne of the accused, Bangladesh Hawkers’ Union Adviser Manjur Moin, told bdnews24.com that the cases were aimed at stopping the movement against eviction. \n“But this wicked strategy will not be able to stop our movement,” he said. \nAfter the cases were initiated on Thursday, DSCC Mayor Sayeed Khokon said a quarter was trying to stop the eviction drive as they would lose the money they were getting through extortion. \nHe also alleged political interference in the movement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:06:23.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
