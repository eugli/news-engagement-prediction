In their own spheres, brothers Ollie, Ben and Luke rang up meaningful successes within a four-day period starting Saturday and ending Tuesday evening.\nIt might be a stretch to call it unprecedented, but it was a remarkable stretch for one of the more noteworthy sets of siblings to ever compete for Tech.\nOn Saturday, Ben, a junior who pitches for the Tech baseball team, made his return from Tommy John surgery, which sidelined him all of the 2016 season. Against Marshall at Russ Chandler Stadium in the second game of the season, he threw one inning of shutout relief, giving up one hit and striking out one in the Yellow Jackets’ 11-3 win.\nOn Sunday, eldest brother Ollie, a three-time All-American during his Tech career, shot a final-round 68 to finish in a tie for eighth at the Genesis Open in Pacific Palisades, Calif. Ollie, in his first year on the PGA Tour, now has three top-10 finishes in nine starts, including two in his past three starts. He ranks 36th on the money list with $666,016 pocketed.\nOn Tuesday, Luke, a freshman at Tech, won his second tournament for the Jackets golf team, taking the Puerto Rico Classic with a three-round total of 10-under 206. Luke won the Carpet Capital in the fall, putting him well ahead of the pace of his brother’s historic career at Tech. Ollie won six college tournaments, but didn’t win his first until his junior season.\nLater Tuesday, Ben returned to the mound, giving up one earned run and three hits while striking out two to close out the Jackets’ 10-3 road win over Georgia Southern.\nThey’ll have to wait till March for an encore. That’s when Tech’s golf team plays next, March 10-12 at the Seminole Intercollegiate in Tallahassee, Fla., which could be part of a Schniederjans convergence upon the state of Florida. Tech’s baseball team will be at Miami and the PGA Tour stop that week will be at the Valspar Championship in Palm Harbor outside of Tampa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:42:05.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
