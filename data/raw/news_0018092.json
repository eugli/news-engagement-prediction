The Medical Journal of Australia reported during the 1990s, deaths from opiate drugs increased by 170 per cent. \nIt was a national crisis and politicians, police and health workers lobbied to open a medically supervised drug injecting centre, right across the road from Kings Cross station where many were buying their drugs. \nAt least this way, health professionals could stop the spread of HIV and AIDS by giving addicts clean needles and had more of an opportunity to rehabilitate them. \nIt was a debate that went on for years and finally in 2001, it moved from health professionals giving clean needles to addicts in a paper bag on the street, to inviting them into a private centre to get them off the street and needles out of the gutters. \nIt’s the only medically supervised injection centre in the southern hemisphere, and there’s currently the debate Sydney had 16 years ago happening in Melbourne. \nA controversial bill will be introduced to parliament this week with Sex Party leader Fiona Patten pushing for an 18-month trial of an injecting room in North Richmond in Melbourne’s inner city to be modelled off the centre in Kings Cross. \nINSIDE THE KINGS CROSS CENTRE \nIt’s not much different from a doctor’s surgery and does not look like a place you’d find drug addicts. It’s clinical, with pristine steel bench tops with large yellow needle bins, plastic chairs like you’d find at a school desk and a counter that makes you feel like you’re in a pharmacy. Oxygen tanks and gym mats are in the corner waiting for the next overdose. For the workers, seeing people inject drugs is normal and the status quo. \nDr Jauncey, told news.com.au about 150 people came to the centre each day and there’s always a morning rush. \nThe centre is open from 5.30am and closes at 5pm before reopening at 6pm until 10pm.

After five minutes, he was not responding to the oxygen so he was given Narcan, a drug that reverses the effects of opiates. It still took another five minutes before he began to respond. \n“Without question, without us, that man would have needed an ambulance and if it hadn’t got there in time he would’ve died,” Dr Jauncey said. \nBecause the man overdosed in the injecting centre, staff could revive him straight away and there was no need to call an ambulance. The rate of ambulance call outs in Kings Cross has dropped 80 per cent since the injecting centre opened and there has never been one death. \nYou may think all the clients are long term drug users with mental health issues and are homeless, but Dr Jauncey said that wasn’t always the case. \nRecently a man used the injecting facility who had a stable job and didn’t match the profile of a stereotypical drug user. Before he visited the injecting centre, he overdosed in the street in Kings Cross outside the police station and was taken to hospital for two weeks. \n“Just talking to him he was like ‘I’m at rock bottom, I’m about to lose my job, I just came out of two weeks in hospital and my family is just about to wash their hands of me’. It makes you think OK, let’s do some work here,” Dr Jauncey said. Clients wait their turn at the injection centre.

Clients are rarely erratic and in the last two years, there have been no violent incidences as a result of methamphetamine use. \n“There’s a lot of myths about methamphetamine and I’m not saying it’s not associated with a wide range of problems or encouraging use, but to say everybody who uses methamphetamines is suddenly some wild violent axe-wielding maniac is just laughable,” Dr Jauncey said.

Dr Jauncey slammed claims the injecting centre was an old idea. \n“Firstly we didn’t open until 2001 and secondly I’ve been accused of a lot of things but old hat has never been one of them. Ireland is on the cusp of opening one, Canada is about to open up another three and the US is looking at opening one,” she said. \n“All around the world the number of cities that have injecting facilities has only ever increased over time so I don’t think you could accuse us of being old news.” Medically supervised injecting centre medical director Dr Marianne Jauncey.

The centre opened in Kings Cross purely because that’s where the problems were. If the injecting room was opened in an area where there was no drug use, addicts wouldn’t bother because they’d want to get their hit straight away. Dr Jauncey says she is no expert on Melbourne, but said an injecting room in the city should be considered. \n“In Melbourne, Montreal or Timbuktu, if you have problematic injecting drug use and a number of people are requiring ambulance attendance because of overdose and a number of people are dying of accidental overdose and discarded equipment is in the streets, there’s public use going on and the local business community and local residents are sick of that and you’re lucky enough to have local police and council to support you, you tell me what the evidence based reasoning is not to open a proven service,” Dr Jauncey said. \nThe sex party leader pushing the injecting room in Victoria told AAP needle exchanges were sending people out to use illegal drugs in car parks, people’s doorways and public toilets. \nLast year almost 40 people died from drug overdoses in North Richmond where the injecting centre would open. \nMr Foley said there were no plans to open an injecting room in the state and Ms Patten said it “flies in the face of all the evidence”.
