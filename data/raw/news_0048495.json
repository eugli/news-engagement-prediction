In his words: \"I would be wrong to allow my poor choice of words to detract from my colleagues' important reporting, so today I am resigning from Breitbart, effective immediately.\" It was reported earlier today that the website was considering axing him. \nWhatever the case, bye-bye, Milo. CGW 02.21.17 | an hour ago 3D camera tech could be the iPhone 8’s biggest addition \nApple's next iPhone could include a front camera that measures 3D space, or at least that's the claim from KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo , a fairly reliable source for Apple rumors. By sensing depth, the iPhone 8 camera could offer face recognition as a security feature, and could open up some novel uses for apps, such as transplanting the user's face onto a game character. PrimeSense , a 3D scanning firm that Apple acquired in late 2013, would reportedly supply the algorithms, and Lumentum would provide infrared sensing, as Fast Company has reported previously . \n3D-sensing cameras are hardly new, but no smartphone maker has managed to take the concept mainstream. Amazon's Fire phone was a flop , Google's Tango depth-sensing tech is only available on a single phone from Lenovo , and Microsoft's Windows Hello camera login system is getting more traction on PCs than mobile devices. Apple's rumored camera could be the company's first journey into augmented reality , but even if it only served as a supplement for TouchID fingerprint biometrics, that alone could make security more convenient.

Send California Senate leader’s bill would move Golden State to 100% clean energy \nEven as the Trump administration is trying to make coal great again, out in California, there's still a sense that perhaps moving away from non-renewables is the way to go for a prosperous and safe future. That's why Kevin de León, the leader of the state's Senate, has i ntroduced a bill that would transition the country's most populous state to 100% clean energy by 2045 . \nThe Desert Sun notes that de León's proposed legislation moves California well past current law, which mandates that 50% of energy will be renewable by 2030. In fact, the bill would require hitting that 50% mark by 2025 before phasing out fossil fuels entirely over the following 20 years.
