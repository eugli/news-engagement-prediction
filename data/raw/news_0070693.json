It's going to be absolutely just the opposite,\" he said. \nTrump ran on a platform that called for deregulating the market. \nHe earlier took an executive action that requested two old regulations be scrapped for every new rule put into place. \nTrump has so far signed 13 executive actions, many of which are about shedding government regulations or boosting national security.
