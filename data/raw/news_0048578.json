I think it is good for my health. I insist on doing it every day. I believe it builds up resistance and I have got less fever and cold than before,” the master said. \nThe master has been polishing his skill with a relentless training regimen for ten years now. Despite a lack of scientific proof, ‘Iron Crotch Kung Fu’ adherents believe that the practice is essential for male sex health and helps counter such problems as erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. \nThe video shows the master and his disciples taking blows to their testicles with hands, feet and even a medieval looking device suitable for breaching gates. The master claims that his art is rapidly gaining popularity with the emergence of new schools following the path of ‘Iron Crotch.' \n“It was the kind of Kung Fu which can only be inherited by family members. I learned it from Master Wang Yongzhi. With time, we want it to be more popular and accepted by the public. More and more masters are opening studios to teach it and attracting an increasing number of people to learn it,” the master said. \nWitnesses to the training session in the Chinese city of Luoyang seemed to be fascinated, admiring the 'ballsy' courage and toughness of the Kung Fu enthusiasts. \n“I am shocked,” said one passerby. “It is supposed to be the weakest part of a man, but it is the strongest part of a man now. I am so shocked.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:54:54.252+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
