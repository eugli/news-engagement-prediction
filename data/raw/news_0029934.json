More videos Grant Hackett in police custody \nFormer Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett has been taken into police custody on the Gold Coast. Vision courtesy Seven News. \nFor Hackett, we now know they were the only thing holding him together. His burly facade ... tall, broad, powerful ... cloaked the turmoil of a man who would find himself lost without the rigid structures of the sport that made him famous. \nVision of a groggy Hackett being driven into the Southport police station on the Gold Coast on Wednesday afternoon saddened those who had hoped he had turned a corner. His family, friends and former swimming colleagues desperately want him to regain his mental health.

For their protection, and his own, Hackett was taken into custody and released later in the day with no charge. \nHackett will now look for a fresh start â€“ and this time it cannot be a false one. He has no choice but to lay bare his deepest problems to those who can help the most. In the past, he has made noises about serious, genuine reform. Now the stakes are too high to be ignored.
