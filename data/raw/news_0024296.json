He cited terror-related arrests of Somalian nationals connected to al Shabaab, but conceded that those cases had not been admitted to the record in the lawsuit.\nWithout that evidence in hand, Flentje was exposed to counterarguments that the order was written not simply to restrict travel from dangerous countries, but with the goal of preventing Muslims from reaching the U.S.\n\"Haven't there been allegations here of bad faith?\" Judge Michelle Friedland asked at during the argument.\n\"The states are claiming that the executive order violates the Establishment Clause,\" she observed at another point. \"If that's true, and it can't meet the standards that the Establishment Clause imposes, then wouldn't it be invalid on its face?\"\nTrump's campaign rhetoric about banning Muslims proved a stumbling block, but Flentje argued the text of the executive order was itself the \"best evidence\" of Trump's intent. And the order, he emphasized repeatedly, was based on a congressional determination that the seven affected countries — Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen — pose a heightened terrorist threat.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Sanders: Healthcare access 'doesn't mean a damn thing' \nBernie Sanders pushed vehemently back against Ted Cruz's response to whether healthcare is a right for all Americans.\nCruz said during a CNN town hall debate that every American has the right to \"access to healthcare\" and choosing their own doctor.\n\"Access doesn't mean a damn thing,\" said Sanders, the Vermont senator who challenged Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic nomination. \"What it means is if people can afford it.\"\nSanders added that everyone has access to buying one of President Trump's mansions. \"You can do that as well,\" he said.\nCruz, the senator from Texas that challenged Trump for the GOP nomination, said that you \"have the right for government not to mess with you.\nBy Robert King • 02/07/17 10:09 PM \"It is extraordinary for a court to enjoin the president's national security determination based on some newspaper articles, and that's what has happened here,\" Flentje said. \"That is very troubling second-guessing of the national security decision made by the president.\"\nTop Story Warren shut out of Sessions debate The   the Democratic senator sparked a floor fight.\nBy Pete Kasperowicz • 02/07/17 7:51  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:46:43.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
