All Stories \nWheeler Walker Jr., the deviant, dick-swinging country character who turned heads with last year's polarizing debut Redneck Shit , has announced a new album. Titled Ol' Wheeler , the record reunites the hairy-chested, shit-talking Walker with Grammy-winning producer Dave Cobb, who, this time, adds a touch of Eighties-era Hank Williams Jr. to Walker's twang-trash sound.
