McCartney will be making a guest appearance on Starr’s latest record, a follow-up to 2015’s Postcards from Paradise. \nStarr took to Twitter to thank his former bandmate for joining him in the studio. “Thanks for coming over man and playing great bass,” Starr wrote. “I love you man – peace and love.” #RingoStarr (@ringostarrmusic) Thanks for coming over man and playing Great bass. I love you man peace and love. 😎✌️🌟💖😇☮ pic.twitter.com/Z5kpyLLlkO February 20, 2017 \nAlso joining the former Beatles in the studio was Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh, who Starr said had “come out to play”. \nBruce Sugar, who is producing Starr’s latest album, posted a photo of him with McCartney and Starr on Facebook, with the caption: “Magical day in the studio today with these two.” \nIt is the first time since 2010 that the pair have collaborated to make music, when McCartney played bass on Starr’s track Peace Dream, and contributed his vocals to Walk With You. \nStarr confirmed he was working on a new record last year, but said a release date was still not scheduled.
