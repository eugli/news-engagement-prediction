It demonstrates the frustrations going on within the Warriors, as they picked up their first loss after a five-game win streak, and neither player played well enough in order to extend the streak to six. \nDurant only scored 10 points on two-of-10 shooting, with nine rebounds and two assists, while Green only had 16 points, eight rebounds, and six assists. The 26-year-old even said after the game that the former Oklahoma City Thunder star needs to take more than just 10 shots. \nThe power forward also defused any sort of problem with Durant on Snapchat, as he didn't believe the altercation with him during the Kings game was a big deal. \nWe'll have to wait and see how the Warriors react to this loss and this situation when they play against the Chicago Bulls at home on Wednesday night.
