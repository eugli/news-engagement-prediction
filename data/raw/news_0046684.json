It’s a bust. \nAfter the two artists went at it online with insults and slurs, the heated exchange morphed into a real-life battle and the promise of a grudge match to square things off. But it seems the touted boxing match won’t happen after all. \nSoulja Boy tweeted on Sunday (Feb. 19) that Brown was scared of him and refused to sign off on the fight. And on Monday, Soulja Boy was busy again on Twitter, this time writing that the “fight is off” and leaving the blame at Brown’s feet. He tweeted, “Chris Brown manager call my manager last night sand said the fight is off and he's not signing contract. Don't ask me about the s--- no more.” Chris brown manager call my manager last night sand said the fight is off and he's not signing contract. Don't ask me about the shit no more — Soulja Boy (@souljaboy) February 20, 2017 \nSince talk of a fight heated up, boxing champs Floyd Mayweather, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield and rapper 50 Cent threw their hats into the ring to help orchestrate the contest. Tyson even vowed to teach Brown “every dirty trick in the book,\" including ear biting. \nIn response to a question on whether the fight would go ahead, Soulja Boy tweeted, “Nah he acting like a Bitch. Won't sign the boxing contract.” Brown has not tweeted about the fight and its status. Nah he acting like a Bitch. Won't sign the boxing contract https://t.co/CCwxntMJ6H — Soulja Boy (@souljaboy) February 21, 2017 \nWith Soulja Boy insisting he's done talk about the fight, he can devote his time and energy to promoting his new Big Soulja mixtape, which dropped Sunday night.
