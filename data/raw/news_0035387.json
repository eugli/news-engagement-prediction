I’m still not! I don’t know what’s going on! But I think back in the '60s it just was much more open. I'm open. My sexual orientation is up for grabs, I guess you could say.” \nAs for the gay man she once dated: Philip Sayer . \n“I did at one point have a very successful and very loving and wonderful affair with a man who then wasn't with another woman after me, and that worked out fine!” she shared, before revealing it was the late actor, whom she worked on 1983's The Hunger with. \"Philip Sayer — he was a wonderful actor. He passed away, but yes, he was gay, and we had a great relationship in every way.” Unlikely Celebrity Couples \nThe Stepmom actress was married to Chris Sarandon for 12 years before splitting in 1979.
