However, few of those rituals rival that of Twins left-hander Ryan O’Rourke. \nO’Rourke recently revealed that he vomits before almost every pitching appearance, a “tradition” that dates back to his collegiate career and resulted in minor-league grounds crews waiting with a new trash bag when he entered the game. “It just happens,” O’Rourke told the Pioneer Press . “I’m pretty pumped up out there. I think everything is culminating as I’m getting ready for my big moment, whether it’s energy or what. I like the competitive aspect. I think this is just a way for me to release a little bit of my nerves.” \nO’Rourke explains that he doesn’t do the deed where fans can see him and noted that hoops Hall of Famer Bill Russell also had a nervous stomach before big games in his career, which included 11 NBA championships. \nUnderstandably, teammates might not be too eager to have a locker near O’Rourke or even sit near him in the bullpen.

And, of course, he likely lost his lunch 26 times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:53:47.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
