Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA body artist has been slammed by animal rights activists after drugged his hairless pet Sphynx cat and covered it in TATTOOS . \nThe man, named only as Aleksandr, inked the animal, which he calls Demon, himself in the city of Yekaterinburg in central Russia's Sverdlovsk Oblast region. \nAleksandr, who has 10 tattoos on his own body, has given his hairless pet four major tattoos on its sides and chest. \nHe said that he had to give Demon an anaesthetic so that he could stand the pain of the ink needle and admitted that he might not have been doing the right thing.

It's not like he wanted to do it himself. He has a different skin, so tattoos are applied differently. \n\"I hope it is not too bad for him, it is not his first tattoo. Usually he feels fine and recovers from the anaesthesia pretty fast.\" \nThe tattoos that Aleksandr chose for Demon are of the type typically worn by criminals in Russia, including representations of a prison tower, a pretty woman and a cigarette. Demon is covered with four tattoos (Photo: CEN / Life.ru) \nThey are often used to denote the seniority of the member of a criminal gang, how long they have served in prison and the seriousness of their crimes. \nAnimal activist Yelizaveta Skorynina condemned Aleksandr for putting Demon through the pain of the ordeal for no reason other than his own vanity. \nShe said that the skin of Sphynx cats was extremely sensitive and that giving the pet an anaesthetic was also an unnecessary risk.

If he does it frequently, it could affect its heart.\" \nHowever, another local tattooist, Aleksandr Purtov, defended his namesake, saying that what he had done was no worse than a farmer branding his livestock. \n\"It is an old practice, this is why I am neutral to it,\" he added. \nSphynx cats were developed through selective breeding and are known for their lack of fur but are not completely hairless.
