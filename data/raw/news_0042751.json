But it took Arsenal 27 minutes to go ahead as Granit Xhaka spread the ball wide to Perez, the Spanish striker cut in and unleashed a low left footed shot.\nPerez has been complaining about a lack of first team chances but he clearly had a point to prove and his low cross shot flew into the far corner.\nAlexis Sanchez is grabbed by fans on the pitch after full time (Photo: Getty Images Europe) Sutton United fans invade the pitch at the full time whistle (Photo: Rex Features) That should have calmed nerves but Arsenal keeper David Ospina looked edgy and nervous, he looked uncomfortable and a poor clearance gifted a chance to Adam May but the Sutton midfielder fired tamely wide.\nArsenal came out for the second half and you expected them to exert their superiority and extra fitness.

Sadly, it also saw hundreds of fans run onto the pitch as the supporters baited each other in an unsavoury ending to the night.\nBut not even that should take the gloss off Sutton’s memorable FA Cup run and Arsenal will be grateful they did not become another giant killing victim.\npoll loading Will Arsenal win the FA Cup this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO   Arsenal FC Newsletter Follow @mirrorfootball Subscribe to our Arsenal FC   Comments Show more comments More On Theo Walcott Alexis Sanchez Arsene Wenger David Ospina FA Cup Lincoln City Football Club Premier League Arsenal FC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:24:37.720+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
