But the UK’s Vanguard-class nuclear submarines are all ready for action, although they carry the UK’s Trident nuclear deterrent. A Royal Navy spokesman said: 'We don’t comment on specific submarine operations. 'Britain has a world-class fleet, the Royal Navy continues to meet all of its operational tasking, deploying globally on operations and protecting our national interests as Britain steps up around the world.' It comes after British and French jets were yesterday scrambled to intercept Russian nuclear bombers approaching UK airspace. The Tupolev TU-160 Blackjack bombers were in the UK's 'area of interest' but did not enter British territorial airspace, the RAF said. The French Air Force released these pictures taken yesterday of one of its Mirage jets escorting the bombers. The bomber is believed to be named after Nikolai Kutnetsov, a famous Soviet aircraft engineer Typhoon jets from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland and RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire were scrambled to keep watch on the bombers in the latest sign of Russian military activity close to the UK. The French air force said two of its Mirage military aircraft escorted the two bombers down the French coast before handing over to Spanish military planes. The United States is currently deploying thousands of soldiers and heavy weaponry in Poland, the Baltic states and southeastern Europe in its biggest build-up since the Cold War. German troops and armour are also due to reinforce Lithuania this month as part of NATO's plans, which are designed to reassure European countries after Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea.
