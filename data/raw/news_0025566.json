However, it's not only the fans who are excited for the movie. The man who wrote the Infinity Gauntlet comic series is also keeping his eye on the film and he has one request for the Russo Brothers. Now that the movie has begun to actually film, Jim Stalin took this opportunity to look for a cameo role. \nWell, from the looks of all those notes sticking out of a copy of the Infinity Gauntlet in this screen shot from The... Posted by Jim Starlin on Sunday, February 12, 2017 \nJim Starlin is responsible for some of the most iconic characters and stories in the history of Marvel Comics. Not the least of which is Thanos the Mad Titan himself. He also wrote the Infinity Gauntlet storyline on which Avengers: Infinity War is primarily based. He took to Facebook to make an argument that this should earn him some screen time alongside his creations. \nHe points out that the movie will likely be only loosely based on his comic, though that doesn't seem to bother him. Since the lead up to Avengers: Infinity War is only the handful of films, and not the multiple decades of Marvel comics, the direction has been a bit different. Still, while the catalyst for Captain America: Civil War wasn't the same as it was in the comics, the heart of the story was the same and we'd expect something similar to happen with Infinity War . We wouldn't see all of those bookmarks in the copy of Infinity Gauntlet if they weren't expecting to be referring to the book constantly during production. \nIt would seem only fair to give Jim Starlin his cameo. Stan Lee has been able to cameo in every Marvel movie and while his connection to some the characters is just as strong, he's also been able to cameo in films based on characters he had a lot less to do with directly. \nThe Russo Brothers have seen the plea, and based on their response, it would appear that Jim Starlin will be following Stan Lee into the world of Marvel cameos. \nWe've got your close up ready, Mr. Starlin. Posted by The Russo Brothers on Monday, February 13, 2017 \nSo it would appear that we can now look forward to seeing the creator of Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet somewhere inside Avengers: Infinity War . We'd assume this will be some sort of cameo role. Of course, since Jim Starlin is hardly the recognizable face that Stan Lee is, there's a good chance that most won't even recognize him when he shows up on screen. Still, he'll be a great little easter egg to pay tribute to the story's origin and if you do recognize him you can show off to all your friends later.
