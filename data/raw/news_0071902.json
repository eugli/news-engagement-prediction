The cat was eventually adopted out of the shelter, according to officials in the statement. \nThe Old Bridge Animal Shelter could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. \nAccording to the NJSPCA, Chen has been issued summonses along with a notice to appear in court on March 8. Because Chen is a township employee, the NJSPCA has requested a venue outside of Old Bridge. \nSpencer Kent may be reached at . Follow him on Twitter @SpencerMKent .
