Super Bowl commercials often attempt to capture the essence of what makes America great. And in this year’s commercials full of people of color, immigrants, and little girls who kick ass, one couldn’t help but see the subtle (and sometimes overt) pushback to a president who has made bigotry and division a hallmark of his platform. \nOne after the other, the commercials consistently showed a country that embraces values that are most certainly “anti-Trumpian”—filled with unity, hope and a broad diversity of the American experience. \nOf course, most of these “wahoo diversity” messages were launching subtle critiques at Trump’s recent executive order banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. But no ad leaned harder into the pro-immigrant programming than Budweiser’s “Born the Hard Way.” In this cinematic paean to beer and 19 th century immigration, German co-founder Adolphus Busch endures tough conditions and xenophobic rhetoric on his journey towards achieving the American dream of brewing for a living. While the company claimed that the commercial wasn’t meant as a political statement, anti-immigrant critics responded to the controversial spot with a cry to #BoycottBudweiser. \nYou can watch the Budweiser ad (and others) below. x YouTube Video \nThen there was this 84 Lumber commercial , which featured a Mexican mother and daughter attempting to cross the border in search of the American Dream—only to encounter a giant wall. Because the whole commercial was deemed too controversial to air, an edited and incomplete version was shown. To watch the entire thing, viewers were directed to the company’s website, which crashed from a surge in traffic. Fair warning: watching without tissues may not be a good idea. \n“Ignoring the border wall and the conversation around immigration that’s taking place in the media and at every kitchen table in America just didn’t seem right,” Rob Shapiro, the chief client officer at Brunner, 84 Lumber’s ad agency, told The Washington Post . “If everyone else is trying to avoid controversy, isn’t that the time when brands should take a stand for what they believe in?” \nAll of the commercials were great and each one served to counter the misogynistic, anti-immigrant, monistic society that Trump hopes to take us back to. But among the funniest and most accurate commercials was this one, which assured viewers that we are in for “at least four years of awful hair.” x YouTube Video \nOf course, Trump was too busy tweeting about his friendship with Tom Brady to notice all the shade being thrown his way. But this was shade of epic proportions. It’s great to know that in the Trump era, even advertisers have joined the resistance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T21:15:06.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
