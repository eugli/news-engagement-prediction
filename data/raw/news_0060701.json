The moves were outlined in a pair of memos signed by DHS Secretary John Kelly.

But they make clear that ICE agents should also arrest and initiate deportation proceedings against any other undocumented immigrant they encounter. \n\"Department personnel have full authority to arrest or apprehend an alien whom an immigration officers has probable cause to believe is in violation of the immigration laws,\" one memo said. \"They also have full authority to initiate removal proceedings against any alien who is subject to removal under any provision of the (Immigration and Nationality Act).\" \nThe memos fulfill Trump's campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration. Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for lower levels of legal and illegal immigration, said the memos capture many recommendations his group has been making for years. \n\"It's Christmas in February,\" Stein said. \"What (Homeland Security Secretary John) Kelly has done is lay out a broad road map of regaining control of a process that's spun out of control.\" \n► Related: Freedom seems to be missing from president’s vocabulary \nImmigration advocacy groups were crushed. Although Trump recently said his focus would be to deport undocumented immigrants with criminal histories or who pose a threat to national security, the new memos make clear that nearly all undocumented immigrants are at risk. \n\"These memos lay out a detailed blueprint for the mass deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants in America,\" said Lynn Tramonte, deputy director of America's Voice Educational Fund, which advocates on behalf of immigrants. \"They fulfill the wish lists of the white nationalist and anti-immigrant movements and bring to life the worst of Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric.\" \nOne group appears to be spared for now. A Homeland Security official who briefed reporters Tuesday said deportation protections that President Obama granted in 2012 to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children will continue to be honored so long as those immigrants abide by the rules of the program. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss details of the memos. \n► Column: For tweeter-in-chief Donald Trump, a crash course in civics \nMore than 750,000 undocumented immigrants have been granted deportation protections under that program, known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program (DACA). \nThe orders also detail a broad plan to keep undocumented immigrants caught crossing the southwest border from making it to the interior of the U.S. They call for detaining all of them until their cases are resolved. \nCurrently, many undocumented immigrants are processed by immigration agents, released into the country and ordered to reappear for court hearings. The memos seek to end that practice, known as “catch and release,” by ordering the construction of more jails along the southwest border to house detained immigrants until their cases are resolved. \nThe new directives also allow Customs agents to send some people directly back to Mexico, whether they’re Mexican or not. Under previous administrations, people from Mexico and Canada could be deported directly back home. But people from all other countries, such as from Central America, had to be detained until they could be flown back to their country of origin. \nThe memos do not mention the idea of using National Guard troops along the southwest border, as reported by several media outlets last week. \nOn the campaign trail, Trump regularly highlighted crimes committed by undocumented crimes and embraced the families of the victims of those crimes. Now, there will be a permanent office within ICE to carry on that message. \nThe Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office, or VOICE, establishes a process to keep victims and their families informed about the status of criminal cases against the undocumented immigrants and any followup deportation proceedings. The new orders eliminate protections that had been granted to undocumented immigrants under the federal Privacy Act, meaning ICE will now publicly distribute information about these cases. \n\"I direct the Director of ICE to immediately reallocate any and all resources that are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens ... to the new VOICE Office,\" Kelly wrote in one directive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:08:01.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
