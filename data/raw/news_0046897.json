Speaking with State House correspondents on Tuesday , Adesina said that the test results are responsible for Buhari’s long stay in the UK. He said “The President wants Nigerians to know that he appreciates their prayers, he appreciates their concerns and their goodwill. He has added that there is really no cause to worry. “He is the one who owns the body and there is nobody who will know his body more than him and he says no cause to worry. “It makes sense to say that maybe from the results of the tests, further rests had been recommended. The statement did not say how long the rest will last. “I speak for somebody, I do not speak for myself. So it is what he tells me to say that I say and the statement transmitted to me is that the President needs to rest for some further time.” he said On the possibility that he will speak directly to Nigerians, he said: “What he has just done is to speak to Nigerians.” Asked to speak on the President’s sickness, he said “Don’t you know that the Hippocratic Oath even forbids a doctor from speaking about the condition of his patient except the patient authorises it? It is only the patient himself who can speak about what he is going through. “This is the person going through these series of tests and rest and he says no cause to worry, let us believe that.” On why journalists trying to reach the President in UK were been harassed, he said “I do not consider that an harassment. Presidents are not hijacked and interviewed. Those things are scheduled. So I do not consider that as harassment. Also speaking on the reports that Buhari may remain in UK for months, he said: “What we have just said is what I will want us to believe. The President said he needs to rest further. The same President that communicated that to us, when it is time for him to come, he will also communicate to us. On the claim that the President has lost his voice, he said that those making the claim needs to prove it. “Those people need to prove it. He spoke with President Trump. Did Trump say he did not speak with Nigerian President. Anybody can allege anything. “My message to Nigerians is that let us learn to believe our leaders. This is a man we elected into office and he says no cause to worry, let us believe him,” he added . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:02:13.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
