The state School Reform Office has identified the 38 for potential closure because they have ranked in the bottom 5% academically for the last three years. \nA final decision on school closure will come later this month or early March. The state will consider whether there are better-performing schools near those slated for potential closure. If there aren't, those schools would remain open but the state would impose an intervention, such as the appointment of a CEO to take over a school's academics, in a bid to turn it around. \nSpeakers at the rally said the closures will have a negative impact on students and communities. They raised concerns that most, if not all, of the schools on the list are in majority African-American communities. And they vowed to fight. \n\"If nobody knew before today, Detroit stands up and fights back,\" community activist Monica Lewis-Patrick told the crowd. \nOf the 25 Detroit schools on the list, 16 are in the Detroit Public Schools Community District, eight are part of the Education Achievement Authority and one is a charter school. \nThe DPSCD Board of Education last week gave administrators the authority to sue the state over the potential closures, if the district leaders deem a court fight necessary. \nMeanwhile, the Kalamazoo Public Schools Board of Education this week authorized a lawsuit that will be filed, likely next week, against the school reform office. The plaintiffs are nine parents whose children attend Washington Writer's Academy and Woodward School for Technology and Research, both of which are on the potential closure list, Superintendent Michael Rice said. \n\"We want to keep our schools open and under local control,\" Rice said. \"We don't believe that the (school reform office) has acted legally. We don't believe it's acting consistently with Michigan state law or in the best interests of children and families.\" \nRice said Saginaw Public Schools, which has two schools on the list, will also be a plaintiff in the lawsuit. \nAt the Detroit protest, Danica Branner, 11, was standing with a glittery and colorful sign urging the state to save Detroit schools. She attends Paul Robeson/Malcolm X Academy, which isn't on the closure list. But she still came to the rally. \n\"Sometimes we need a voice,\" Danica said. \nShe said schools in DPSCD \"need a lot,\" including more after-school activities, more teachers and better curricula. \nContact Lori Higgins: 313-222-6651, lhiggins@freepress.com or @LoriAHiggins 34 CONNECT 6 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:20:05.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
