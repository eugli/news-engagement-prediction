The Sharjah Sharia Court sentenced to death a Pakistani teenager who murdered a student during a football match. The father of the teenager was in a state of shock after hearing the judgement. He said: \"I will appeal against this as my son is juvenile and didn't intentionally kill and it was just a brawl.\" The accused allegedly stabbed the victim using a small knife during a brawl while they were playing football. In December last year, the family of the student had refused to pardon the defendant. The Sharjah Sharia Court had given a grace period of one month so that the family of the defendant can negotiate with the victim's family. The Pakistani student who stood trial at the Sharjah Criminal Court had claimed that he committed the act in self-defence. The incident dates back to August 2015, when the accused allegedly stabbed the victim using a small knife during a brawl while they were playing football in the Butaina area of Sharjah. The police were informed that a Pakistani boy had been brought to the Kuwaiti Hospital with a stab wound in his chest. The victim died later in the hospital. The police arrested the accused, who confessed to the crime. Lawyer of the accused told the court that the victim attacked his client over some previous disputes and he stabbed the victim in self-defence. At the court, brothers of the victim refused to pardon the accused. Father of the accused told Khaleej Times that his son was a minor at the time of the incident and he did not mean to kill the victim.
