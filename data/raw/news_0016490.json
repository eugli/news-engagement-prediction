Published:February 7, 2017 12:29 am Kashmir has received over 162.2 mm of snowfall in January alone. Source: Shuaib Masoodi \nHow much snow does Kashmir receive every winter on an average? \nThe Meteorology Department considers 26 cm of snowfall in the winter as average for Kashmir. However, over the past three decades, the amount of snow has been declining, attributed mostly to global warming. \nHow much snow has the Valley received this time? \nThis time, Kashmir has received more than162.2 mm or 16.2 cm of snowfall in January alone. The overall figure stands at 23 cm. January is the coldest month in Kashmir with temperatures remaining below sub-zero levels and cold winds blowing. The recent phase of heavy snowfall has coincided with the period of chillai kalan, the harshest 40-day period of winter in Kashmir, which begins on December 21 and lasts up to January 30. Night temperatures in this period drop up to -10 degrees Celsius in the plains, and to -20 degrees in the upper reaches. \nHow is this year different from other cold spells in the past? \nIt is after 26 years that the Valley has seen three spells of heavy snowfall in January. Though Kashmir had seen good snowfall in 2006 too, that time it had snowed in February and the snow didn’t last long, especially in the upper reaches, because of higher temperatures in that month. The sub-zero temperatures in January mean the snow has solidified this time, increasing its shelf life. \nIn meteorological terms, what qualifies as ‘heavy snowfall’? \nMore than 7 cm of snow in 24 hours is considered heavy snowfall. \nWhat is the reason for this much snowfall in January? \nThe Met Department attributes it to Western Disturbance, an ‘extratropical’, non-monsoon precipitation pattern driven by westerly winds, which arises in the Mediterranean Sea, Caspian Sea and Black Sea and brings winter rain or snow to northwestern parts of the India, as well as to Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. \nThe Western Disturbance has led to heavy snow this time in not just Kashmir but also Himachal Pradesh. Extratropical storms usually carry moisture in the upper atmosphere, unlike their tropical counterparts where the moisture is carried in the lower atmosphere. \nWestern Disturbance is important for rabi crop as it sustains the Himalayan snow cover, which ensures water for irrigation during the summer months when the glaciers melt. \nNow that chillai kalan is over, does it mean there is no possibility of any more snow in the Valley? \nThe Met Department has predicted more snowfall in February. Previous years show it can snow in the Valley between November and March, but as explained earlier, it is the snowfall in December and January that lasts longer. March marks the arrival of spring in Kashmir. \nWhat is the significance of chillai kalan in the Valley? \nThe 40-day period is considered a blessing. Apart from drawing tourists, including now foreigners to Gulmarg’s ski slopes, the snow helps recharge the state’s water-table and is good for its horticulture industry. \nThe more affluent homes in the Valley have a room with hallowed stone floor, called the hamam, for precisely this period. Wooden logs kept in the hollow space are set afire on cold days to warm up the floor.
