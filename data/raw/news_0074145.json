Transport Services Ltd, has reacted to the accident involving one of its luxury buses recently at Owode-Elede in Lagos, saying it was unfortunate and saddening. \nThe company said it sympathizes with the affected passengers and their relations for the inconveniences and losses suffered in the crash. \nA survivor of the accident recounted that the Lagos-bound bus which departed Aba Thursday at about 8:00 pm, hit a concrete demarcation on the road early Friday morning at Owode and ran into the nearby river resulting in the death of three passengers. \nThe rest of the occupants of the 59-seater vehicle survived with a few rushed to hospitals for the treatment of injuries. •The bus with registration number, Anambra GDD:386 YE, being pulled out of the canal at Owode Elede, Mile-12, along Lagos-Ikorodu Road, Lagos, yesterday.

Transport wish to express our utmost sympathy and regret for the distress experienced by the passengers and their families as a result of the accident involving our luxury bus”, the Managing Director stated, appealing to them to “bear with us during this sad period”. \nOkeke said it was premature to comment on the cause of the crash, preferring to rather wait for “the report and updates from investigations by the agencies” \nHowever, a survivor of the accident, Mr. Kenneth Aaron, who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria, said the accident may have been caused by a slippery surface. \nHis account: “I entered the bus in Onitsha with four of my brothers. The bus passed through Ikorodu because of the ongoing construction on Lagos-Ibadan expressway. \n“It seemed an accident happened in the area before which spilled diesel onto the road. By the time our bus got to the spot, it skidded, hit the culvert and plunged into the river.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:03:53.084+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
