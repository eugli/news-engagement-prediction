And then just went into soccer, track and field and basketball, those were my focuses in high school. But when I started dancing again and actually training I was like, 'Wow,' I just couldn't think of anything else I wanted to do as a profession, but dance and make dances. As a performer, how can I speak to my audience? How can I speak to their humanity? How can I make that connection? That's what is really important to me. I really don't know what I would do if I didn't move and dance and create. I wouldn't be the person I am. I wouldn't be happy. I wouldn't be grounded.\nd'bi young anitafrika is among 150 black women from the GTA featured in a digital-photo series called HERstory in Black.
