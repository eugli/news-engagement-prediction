That's just wrong thinking. Francisco Lindor, Javier Baez (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 7:45 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 7:45 p.m. ET \nNews item: Major League Baseball will experiment this year with shortening extra-inning games. The plan: Begin each half-inning with a runner on second base and no outs, which is intended to expedite scoring. This experiment would take place at the lowest levels of the minor leagues (Gulf Coast, Arizona Rookie). \nOur (naturally correct) reaction: No. Just. No. \nThat's the minimum that needs to be said about this idea, but we owe it to you, the reader, to fully explain why this idea stinks on skates (foreshadowing!). \nFOSTER: Pace of play in MLB is just fine as it is \nAltering game play for the sake of expediency (MLB vice president Joe Torre, in disclosing the experiment, cited concerns about extra-inning games dragging) is always wrong. Baseball currently has it right by playing until there's a winner. Basketball has it right by playing five-minute overtimes. The NFL doesn't quite have it right with its 15-minute sudden-death period. \nMLB, then, is needlessly wading into college football and NHL territory. College football games become red zone drills. The NHL turns regular-season games into skills competitions with its three-on-three overtime and shootouts. These setups are material departures from what transpires during the first 60 minutes. Regardless of whether fans get jacked for these innovations, they're still wrong. \nI'll resist the urge to crack wise and propose that baseball go to a home run derby after 12 innings, because, you know, that's so clichéd. \n“It’s not fun to watch when you go through your whole pitching staff and wind up bringing a utility infielder in to pitch. As much as it’s nice to talk about being at an 18-inning game, it takes time,\" Torre told Yahoo Sports . \nMORE: Commissioner sounds like a fan of pitch clocks \n“It’s baseball. I’m just trying to get back to that, where this is the game that people come to watch. It doesn’t mean you’re going to score. You’re just trying to play baseball.” \nThat's the thing, Joe: It's not baseball. The first nine innings don't automatically start with a runner on second. Bad enough the leagues already play under two sets of rules (DH vs. no DH); playing under two sets of rules within a game is worse. \nAnd, let's be real: Watching a Wilson Valdez or a Chris Davis hold it down on the mound every few months is not going to kill the sport. Besides, those guys don't need to be on the mound if managers were willing to let a long reliever or a starter pitch until the game is over. Torre played when pitchers often went seven, eight, nine innings in extras. \nIf baseball is worried that people will get bored watching the most dramatic innings of a game or a season, it should just adopt Japan's rules and call the game a tie if there's no winner after 12 innings, but still play the game the same way throughout. That would uphold baseball's integrity a lot better that what Torre and Co. are plotting. \nWe just have one favor if this plan is somehow approved by the Players Association in the next few years: Go back to real baseball for the postseason, kind of the way the NHL does for its postseason. Playoff overtime hockey — teams skating five-on-five — is one of the most dramatic things in sports. The NHL, at least, gets that right.
