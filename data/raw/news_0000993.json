They wanted the kid to be a Jayhawk bad, so the assistant never said a word, and proceeded to eat every piece of shrimp on his plate. Beaty says at the end of the night he had to rush him to the hospital because his throat was starting to swell shut. \n… \nReal talk I developed a shrimp allergy 3 years ago. Just completely out of the blue. Grew up eating shrimp basically on a daily basis. Shrimp cocktail, shrimp pasta, shrimp tacos, fried shrimp, popcorn shrimp. Love shrimp. Shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There’s pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. Any way you could eat shrimp, that’s how I ate it – you can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. Then one day I ate it and my face blew up with a million hives. Next time I ate it – a million hives. Took 5-6 times before I finally gave it up. RIP shrimp for me. \nAnyway that was just my way of making this story about Kansas assistant coach David Beaty about myself instead. Respect the hell out of this move by the way. Recruiting is the lifeblood of a program. Gotta do what you gotta do to land the player you need, if you don’t you’ll lose your job and be broke and homeless and slowly die of exposure anyway. Might as well make it quick with a shellfish reaction. Kmarko |", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:30:34.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
