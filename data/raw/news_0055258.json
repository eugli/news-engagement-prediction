He got four notes of Rs 2,000 which had \"churan\" label on them in place of the official watermark. \nThe notes also had \"PK\" written on them in place of the RBI stamp and the top left corner had \"Bharatiya Manoranjan Bank\" written instead of Reserve Bank of India. \nAfter the victim approached the police, a Sub-Inspector was sent to the ATM to withdraw money and he also received a note that had \"Children Bank Of India\" written on it. \nFollowing this, a case of cheating was registered and investigation has been taken up, said a senior police officer. \nAfter scanning the footage from the ATM, police has managed to identify the last man who had filled cash in the machine. \n\"Till now, there have been no other complaints. Probably, only a few notes were changed. We have to identify at which point the real notes were exchanged,\" the officer added.
