(Keyur Khamar/PGATOUR.COM) \nPACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. – Notes and observations from Thursday’s abbreviated opening round of the Genesis Open, where Sam Saunders leads by two shots after a 7-under 64. A total of 48 players hope to finish their first rounds Friday morning, weather permitting. For more Round 1 coverage, click here for the Daily Wrap-up. CAREER-LOW FOR SAUNDERS \nArnold Palmer won this event three times. But never at Riviera. Thus, Sam Saunders wasn’t able to gleam any inside course knowledge from his legendary grandfather before he passed away last September. \nEvidently, Saunders didn’t need it. \nIn his first round at Riviera, Saunders – playing on a sponsor’s exemption -- shot a 7-under 64. That ties for his lowest score in 221 career rounds on the PGA TOUR. \nPalmer’s wins at the then-Los Angeles Open in the mid-1960s were at Rancho Municipal. He played just five times after Riviera began hosting the course in the 1970s. \n“We didn’t talk necessarily specifically about this course,” Saunders said. “He just always talked about how much he loved coming out here and playing. I think his celebrity matched pretty well with the celebrity atmosphere that you have here, so he was obviously very comfortable with that.” \nSince his grandfather’s passing – Saunders provided the emotional tipping point with his moving speech at the memorial service – he has joined the board of the Arnie’s Army Charitable Foundation, and anticipates having more involvement during next month’s Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard. \nBut at the end of the day, his focus remains on golf. He spent time in the offseason in Florida to work on his game, but hasn’t had that as much practice since returning home to his wife and children in Fort Collins, Colorado. “We’ve had a foot of snow on the ground,” he said, “and I haven’t been able to get out and play as much.” \nSaunders knows the week at Bay Hill will be an emotional one, but he wants it to be a celebration of his grandfather’s life. “We all miss him,” he said. “It’s not just me. People come up and say, ‘I’m so sorry for your loss.’ The truth is, we all lost somebody that meant a great deal to us and did a lot for all of us. It’s not just me.” PADDY FACING HEALTH DECISION \nEntering Thursday’s first round, Padraig Harrington had not touched a club for four days since missing the cut at Pebble Beach. Nerve injuries in his shoulder forced him to withdraw from this week’s pro-am. But the time off served him well, as he shot a 4-under 67, his lowest opening round at Riviera since his first start here in 2007 when he shot 63. \nAlthough he’s glad to be in the mix, Harrington may soon face a tough decision. If his nerve issues continue to linger, he may need surgery, which would put him out of action for 12 weeks. Because of the lengthy rehab time, Harrington must decide soon whether to go under the knife. He does not want to miss The Open Championship, which will be played this year at Royal Birkdale, site of his 2008 major win. \n“I kind of have to make a decision in the next couple of weeks,” Harrington said, “to give myself time to get ready for The Open, which is obviously the biggest thing on my schedule this year.” \nHarrington said he will definitely play next week at The Honda Classic, a tournament he’s won twice, and then evaluate from there. Rest might fix the problem, but if he takes too much time off and still has an issue, then The Open might be in jeopardy. \nHe visited a doctor this week and had a cortisone shot, but he doesn’t know if that will make much of an impact. “The problem is, I’m not in pain,” he said. “It takes the pain out.” \nThe trapped nerve in his shoulder is causing him weakness in his shoulders, preventing him from doing push-ups. He also has numbness down his right side, even to the tips of his fingers. “I keep getting paper cuts on my finger,” Harrington said. “I don’t remember getting those.” DUSTIN’S BEE STING \nDustin Johnson was on the first green when he got stung by a bee. What stung worse was failing to birdie the par-5 496-yard hole, which last year was the easiest hole on the PGA TOUR. \nJohnson found the right rough with his tee shot, then hit what he described as an “awful” second shot that landed on the fringe of his green. He couldn’t get up and down for birdie. Of course, the bee sting didn’t help. \nBut Johnson answered back with two birdies to eventually finish at 5-under 66, prime lurking position after the first round. \n“It didn’t help the golf swing,” Johnson said of the bee sting, “but I did make two putts. The golf course gave me a little love back after I got the bee sting.” HERE COMES THE RAIN \nThere’s a 100 percent forecast for rain and high winds Friday. Many players finishing early on Thursday didn’t expect to hit another shot until Saturday. \n“I mentally prepared for not playing golf tomorrow, actually, as I approached this week,” said Sam Saunders. “I said I’ll try to go and get off to a good start and know that day two is probably not going to happen until Saturday.” \nSouth African Branden Grace told playing partner Brandt Snedeker “that we might have two days off.” \nDustin Johnson was just glad to finish his round, given the morning fog delay Thursday. \n“It’s definitely nice having a later tee time tomorrow because I can get up and kind of see how things are going,” Johnson said. “We’ll know if we’re going to play or not, where the other guys, they’re going to have to be out here early in the morning.” SHOT OF THE DAY Phil Mickelson's amazing chip-in eagle is the Shot of the Day ODDS AND ENDS \nAfter Adam Scott finished off his 3-under 68, he mentioned that he and wife Marie were expecting their second child. Scott said the child is due in August around the time of THE NORTHERN TRUST. “It’s likely I shall not be there,” Scott said of the tournament, the first of four FedExCup Playoffs events. “Hopefully I can play well enough to afford myself the week off the FedEx.” … \nDaniel Summerhays has a new-look haircut. He’s also tied for second after a 66. Summerhays said his 7-year-old son approached him several months ago and said he wanted to cut his hair in the same style as his friend. “His best friend’s name is Brigham and it looks sharp on him,” Summerhays said. “I was like, ‘Yeah, buddy, you got it.’ It looked really good on him. I’m like, if it looks good on him, I’m going to give it a try. So I gave it a nice high and tight here, hard part. My wife really likes it. I get an extra kiss every day, so it’s worth it.” … \nPhil Mickelson, making his first start at Riviera since 2013, shot a 67 that included a chip-in eagle on the 17th hole. Mickelson is commuting via plane this week, flying into the nearby Santa Monica airport, which is six miles north of Los Angeles International. “Because I was worried about the fog, I ended up staying over last night,” Mickelson said after his first round. “But I’ll head back now.” … \nKevin Na was 3 over on his first four holes, having hit a tree on the 12th hole. But he was 7 under on his final 14 holes, shooting a 30 on his final nine (the front side). “I fought hard and made a great comeback,” Na said. “It could’ve been ugly. I could’ve shot over par in a heartbeat.” … \nSaunders wasn’t the only first-timer at Riviera to go low Thursday. J.T. Poston (66), Cameron Percy (66) and Byeong Hun An (67) also enjoyed their first look here. BEST OF SOCIAL MEDIA Warming up just before the fog rolled in! Happy with my 68 in round one.
