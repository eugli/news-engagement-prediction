It was great to see the seals who had been so poorly when they came to us swim back out to sea and return to the wild where they belong.\nOne of the reasons I enjoy working with seals so much is that whilst you put so much into their rehabilitation, taking them for release is a fantastic reward.\n– Kirsten Larcombe, RSPCA West Hatch Take a look at the photos of the release below:\nCredit: RSPCA Credit: RSPCA Credit: RSPCA Credit: RSPCA Credit: RSPCA Last updated Wed 22 Feb 2017 Somerset Devon", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:37:49.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
