I want to make a difference for her.” Joanne Good \nShe was at a party where her mum thought she was safe but came home early feeling sick. \nAt midnight her mum said Megan seemed fine as she was texting her friends. \nJoanne put her daughter in the recovery position when she started to lay on her back. \nBut the next morning, Joanne was shocked to find Megan has passed away during the night. \nFROSTY JACKS STRONG: A three litre bottle can be bought for as little as £3.49 \nJoanne added: “I want to make them aware because these drinks are clearly something kids get access to. \n“Teenagers and young adults need to know how dangerous it can be.” \nAston Manor, the largest independent cider maker in the UK, responded by defending its reputation. \nA spokesman said: “Firstly I would like to pass on our sincere condolences to Megan’s family and friends for their devastating loss. \n“We completely understand why Joanne has decided to campaign for an end to the misery caused by alcohol misuse. \n“We’re ready and willing to work with all interested parties to seek effective solutions to what is often a complex problem. As a drinks producer we cannot control retail prices. \n“Any form of alcohol is capable of being misused. \n“We believe it is unfair to level unwarranted criticism at specific brands. For a product like Frosty Jack’s, there is a great deal of mythology in terms of its consumer base and occasions when enjoyed.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:59:40.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
