Digital India has stepped ahead with a new technology of payments and that is Bharat QR Code payments transfer mechanism. This is a more streamlined system of making payments where technological problems will get reduced and people will not suffer from card loss or card expiry problems.\nEasily scanning the QR code through your mobile phone will help you in transferring your money from one source to another. Unlike digital wallets where payments are received from e-wallets, through QR code your payments will directly get received in your bank accounts.\nAlthough various private companies and banks already have this facility in their mobile app , but what makes this QR code different from others is that it is interoperable with all the banks and it is not a closed-loop system.\nHere are 5 things you should know about Bharat QR Code:\nGet away with your digital card usage\nUsing Bharat QR code you do not need to swipe your credit card or debit card through any PoS terminal. You simply need to scan the QR code and transfer the payments. POS machines are readily not acceptable by various merchants because they have many drawbacks like machines do not work most of the time, there are security issues as well. Most of the time terminals do not even read the card properly and then merchants have to bear the loss as their products remain unsold.\nYou may also watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:50:57.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
