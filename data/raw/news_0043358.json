Bartlett, far right in the second row, with his wife, Martha, at the baptismal ceremony for Jacqueline and President-elect John F. Kennedy’s son, John Jr. Credit Associated Press Photo Charles L. Bartlett, a Washington newspaper correspondent and columnist who won a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting but was remembered especially for the dinner party he and his wife, Martha, arranged where they introduced John F. Kennedy to Jacqueline Bouvier, died on Friday in Washington. He was 95. His death was announced by his family. Mr. Bartlett was a Washington reporter for The Chattanooga Times and a syndicated columnist in Washington for The Chicago Sun-Times. He later published a newsletter on the political scene for private clients in a journalism career that spanned some 65 years. While with The Chattanooga Times, he received a Pulitzer in 1956 for articles leading to a Senate subcommittee investigation into conflict of interest issues involving Harold E. Talbott, the secretary of the Air Force in President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s administration, resulting in his resignation in August 1955. Mr. Bartlett first met Kennedy in the winter of 1946 when Kennedy spent time at his family’s home in Palm Beach, Fla., and was considering a run for Congress. Mr. Bartlett’s parents had a home in nearby Hobe, Fla. Both Kennedy and Mr. Bartlett were Ivy League graduates (Harvard and Yale) and both served with the Navy in the Pacific during World War II. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The Bartletts invited Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier, whom they also knew socially, to their Georgetown home for a small party in May 1951. “I had befriended her three or four years earlier,” Mrs. Bartlett said in an interview on Sunday. “Washington was a small town then. The circle was very small.” The Bartletts were part of the Kennedy wedding party in September 1953 in Newport, R.I. Mr. Bartlett’s friendship with Kennedy endured during his presidency and he sent memos to Kennedy assessing the issues of the day. Mr. Bartlett had said that Kennedy consulted him on how to respond to an impending hike in steel prices in spring 1962. Kennedy’s opposition led to a rescinding of the hike. Mr. Bartlett had been an emissary to the steel interests on behalf of Kennedy. During the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962, Mr. Bartlett contacted a Russian intelligence agent in Washington, at the request of Robert F. Kennedy, as a back-channel means of conveying the American stance to the Soviet leadership. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
