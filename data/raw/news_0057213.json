Vgajic / Getty Images Sometimes all you want is to do the kind of daring, delightfully dirty sex positions that would make Christian Grey wonder what the eff he'd gotten himself into. But on other occasions, you may prefer something that feels a little more emotionally raw, like you and your partner have fused into one amazing-sex-having being. Here, seven positions to try when you're craving the sexual equivalent of the heart-eyed emoji . If you're not into that right now, try these seven sex positions that require minimal eye contact instead. 1. Spooning If you're the big spoon, you get to play the role of the protector. As the little spoon, you feel enveloped in a cocoon of sexiness and security. Another point in this position's corner: When you're on the inside, your partner can try manual stimulation , penetration, or both if that's what you're into. Double duty is always a winner.

Not knowing where one of you ends and the other begins can translate into sex so good, you're tempted to walk down the street with a megaphone and broadcast a play-by-play. 3. Sideways It's the face-to-face version of spooning, so you have the added benefit of being able to gaze into each other's eyes, thus getting one step closer to peak sappiness. If you're feeling inspired enough to turn your session into something sweeter than even the best of desserts , you can caress your partner's face and whisper all the things that usually feel too intimate to say. Chances are they'll return the favor. 4. Starfish Yes, Marnie had a bad experience with a version of this on Girls (remember Booth Jonathan and the sassy doll?), but it can still result in electric sex with the right person. To get there, lie on your back, extending your arms and legs like you know you're the prettiest starfish in the sea. Beckon your partner over and ask them to lie on top of you, matching each of their limbs up with yours. It'll feel like you're touching every inch of each other, and as a bonus, you can do a lot of kissing. Pixar via mund0-meu.tumblr.com 5. Modified Doggy This simple variation on doggy style can bring you closer, both literally and figuratively. Lie flat on your stomach and have your partner position themselves between your legs to enter from behind, or reach down with their hand. You'll get full-body contact, and an easy turn of your head makes it possible to kiss throughout the action. 6. Straddling Ask your partner to sit with crossed legs, then settle in on top of them, wrapping your legs around their hips. You'll both benefit from the eye contact, and if you're having sex with a guy , it's tough to do regular old in-and-out thrusting. No matter who you're trying this out with, you can rely on grinding and friction instead. It's like switching from hyped up hip-hop to smooth R&B, except during sex so it's way more fun. 7. However you like it! Maybe you think the above moves are perfectly nice, but what really makes you feel more in love is submitting to someone else during role-play or looking down into their eyes while you do your thing on top. Even more than certain positions, vulnerability is what ups the emotional ante during sex. Something that seems hardcore to one person might translate into major swooning for you, and vice versa. In that case, the only thing you can do to figure it all out is lots of experimenting. Who knew homework could be so much fun?
