Documentary provides revealing look into country’s attitudes February 24, 2017 11:08am Image Is Australia Racist? Woman wearing a niqab is confronted in the street 0:43 \nLANGUAGE WARNING: On 'Is Australia Racist?', a woman wearing a niqab is confronted in the street. Courtesy: SBS February 24th 2017 Share on Twitter \nTHIS is the shocking moment a Muslim woman is racially abused in an expletive filled rant simply because of what she’s wearing. \nWalking through a crowded shopping mall she is approached by a man who confronts her and begins questioning her on why she doesn’t show her face. \nThe video, which was shot in Perth, shows the man saying Australia helped save her from the country she was persecuted in and asks why she then wears “things like that,” referring to her niqab. Rahila is shocked as the man confronts her in front of several people.

They dress with a f*** face! Where’s your ing face?” \n“What are you hiding from? f**** Allah?” \nThe shocked woman tells him she isn’t hiding from anything and dressing like this is how she feels comfortable. The man swears several times during the encounter and asks Rahila why she won’t show her face. Picture: Screengrab/SBS Source: SBS \nHe angrily storms off but not before telling her to **** off but not before another woman calls him a ****head and tells him to “*** off”. \nThe undercover footage was filmed as part of a social experiment for confronting SBS show Is Australia Racist , hosted by veteran TV journalist Ray Martin, which goes to air this Sunday. \nThe woman, 22-year-old Rahila, who normally wears a hijab, agreed to be filmed by the documentary makers in a niqab. \nShe admits she was nervous about the experiment but hadn’t expected quite the reaction she received. The man begins walking away after abusing Rahila in a busy shopping mall. Picture: Screengrab/SBS Source: SBS \nThe law student, who moved to Australia from Afghanistan six years ago, said while she wears the veil she had never worn a niqab before. \n“At that moment I was so shocked I didn’t know how to react,” she tells the program. \n“I did feel traumatised. I didn’t imagine that level of hate.” Rahila was left shaken following the experiment and said she was shocked by some of the reactions she received. Picture: SBS Source: SBS \nLater during the program, Rahila attends a Reclaim Australia rally with surprising results after two women in attendance stand up for her when police tell her to leave. \nThe one hour documentary puts some revealing survey findings from Western Sydney University into action through a series of hidden camera social experiments. Rahila, 22, said she was nervous about wearing the niqab for the experiment. Picture: SBS Source: SBS \nThe survey was undertaken for the documentary as a part of Face Up To Racism week in which SBS explores, expands and challenges Australia’s understanding of racism and prejudice. \nAmong the survey’s key findings was the alarming statistic that 77 per cent of Muslim women had experienced racism on public transport or on the street. \nIt also found almost a third of those surveyed had suffered racism within their workplace, while 35 per cent experienced it on public transport or on the street. \nAlmost a third said they have experienced racism within an educational facility while nearly half of indigenous respondents said they experienced racism at sporting events. Veteran journalist Ray Martin hosts Is Australia Racist? — a show which looks at our attitudes and experiences with this topic. Picture: SBS Source: SBS \nHowever, most people surveyed agreed that it is a positive thing that Australia was culturally diverse and that they would face up to discrimination if they saw or encountered it. \nProfessor Kevin Dunn from Western Sydney University, who conducted the survey on race and prejudice — the biggest of its kind in Australia — said the results weren’t that surprising but some of the findings were “exceptionally disappointing.” \nSpeaking to news.com.au, Prof Dunn said the survey, which spanned a mixture of ages and ethnicities, quizzed 6000 people on their attitudes and experiences about racism. \nHe said the rise of Islamophobia was evident and represented a real issue for race relations going forward. Professor Kevin Dunn from the University of Western Sydney University, who conducted the massive survey on race and prejudice, talks through the findings with Ray Martin. Picture: SBS Source: SBS \nProf Dunn said this was fuelled by geopolitics, the media, fear of terrorism and even mainstream politicians. \n“But there were certainly some positive results including that 80 per cent of those surveyed support cultural diversity,” he said. \n“And 77 per cent believe that something should be done to fight racism in Australia.” \nBut while he said while 76 per cent said they would stand up for someone who was being discriminated against because of their culture, ethnicity or religion, the reality was only between a third to half actually would when push came to shove. \nProf Dunn said he hoped the show and survey would simply get people talking about racism in Australia. \nDocumentary host Ray Martin, who has had decades of experience covering race relations, told news.com.au he believed most Australians were accepting towards other cultures. \nWhile some of us were ignorant in our attitudes towards other cultures, and even our first people, he didn’t think most Australians were actually racist. Melbourne man Jafri Ibra takes his message to the streets. Picture: SBS Source: SBS \n“I was pleasantly surprised by the support and attitudes shown towards minorities generally, and that most people would take action if someone was being abused” he said. \nMartin said he believed those who didn’t stand up but wanted to were often too intimated, scared of a violent reaction, or embarrassed to react. \nHe said the rise of Islamophobia and racist abuse directed towards some African members of the community was also very disappointing. \n“Women are also generally more likely to stand up against racist behaviour and this was shown during the Reclaim Australia rally where two women stand up for Rahila,” he said. \nWhile indigenous people were subjected to racism and discrimination Martin said Muslims were often more obvious and were unjustly seen as violent which could make them bigger targets for racist abuse. Jafri Ibra has experienced racism in the past and was nervous about how his experiment outside the MCG would go. Picture: SBS Source: SBS \n“I believed the issues our indigenous people face is more about neglect rather than deliberate racism,” he said. \n“I think Australians are ignorant, not racist, and if this program shines a light into that dark corner then that’s a good thing.” \nMartin also believed Australia has grown up a lot since he was a kid and our attitudes towards indigenous people and immigrants had changed dramatically, but said there was room for improvement. \n“This documentary is entertaining but it’s done in such a way that it should generate discussion and get people talking,” he said. \nDespite footage capturing racist abuse, it also has some positive stories. \nMelbourne man Jafri Ibra has been on the end of racist abuse and tested if that was reflected in a sporting context. \nAccording to the UWS survey, 35 per cent of people have reported being racially abused in a sporting environment. Jafri stands outside an AFL match at the MCG to see how he and his experiment are received. Picture: SBS Source: SBS \nMr Ibra stood outside the MCG with his stop racism sign to see what response he would receive. \n“When I stood there I was nervous I was vulnerable I was shaking,” he tells the program. \n“I didn’t know what sort of reaction I would receive from the people.” \nBut the results of the experiment surprised him for more reasons than one. \nIs Australia Racist? hosted by Ray Martin airs this Sunday at 8.30pm on SBS, as part of Face Up to Racism week. \nContinue the conversation @newscomHQ | @Raymartin | @DebKillalea #FU2Racism Multicultural Frontline 30:00 \nJoe Hildebrand and four Indian tourists dive head first into Australia's multicultural melting pot.
