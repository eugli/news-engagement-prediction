As scrutiny over the Trump administration's ties to Russia grows, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that Trump had on the contrary been \"incredibly tough on Russia.\" \"He continues to raise the issue of Crimea, which the previous administration had allowed to be seized by Russia. His ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, stood before the UN Security Council on her first day and strongly denounced the Russian occupation of Crimea,\" he told reporters at a press briefing. He said that Trump had made it clear he expected the Russian government to \"deescalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea,\" while at the same time pursuing better relations with Russia. Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia? â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 Trump had previously buoyed the Kremlin's claim on Crimea. The Kremlin shot back at Spicer's comments early Wednesday. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russia was \"not returning our territory. Crimea is part of the Russian Federation.\" Russia annexed Crimea, a territory in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine, in March 2014 following tensions with its neighbor. The US, the European Union and several other Western countries placed sanctions on Russia over the annexation.
