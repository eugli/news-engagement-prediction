Charles Barkley and Reggie Miller (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 11:06 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 11:06 a.m. ET \nWithin days of each other this week, Reggie Miller blamed the defense-optional NBA All-Star Game on \"millennials,\" and Kevin Garnett said that \"AAU has killed our league.\" \nThat makes it official. NBA superstars from the 1990s reached \"Get Off My Lawn\" status faster than any previous era of any sport at any time in American history. \nMORE: Kevin Garnett blaming AAU is lazy, disingenuous — and wrong \nThey're the Crotchety-est Generation. Congratulations, you can pick up your Bermuda shorts and black socks on the way out. \nAt the risk of playing armchair psychologist, it’s now worth asking this group — arguably the greatest generation of players the league has ever seen, the one defined by Michael Jordan and the Bulls’ dynasty — what happened during their heyday to leave them so insecure and defensive about their own legacies, and so bitter and antagonistic about the current state of the sport they supposedly love. \nBecause it’s been a parade of insults, wounded pride and hurt feelings for the last several years, and it grows longer every day, as Garnett and Miller showed. It’s no longer a matter of if someone from that era is going to trash the game next, but when, and who. \nIt’s easier to pick out the ones who haven’t sat on their porch shaking their cane at those young punks, than to name all the ones who have. Charles Barkley , of course; this is now his full-time job, riffing off of the theme that the NBA \"is worse than it’s ever been.\" \nMORE: Curmudgeon-in-chief Charles Barkley frustrated with poor NBA product \nAnd they have problems with how the Warriors play. How Kevin Durant changed teams. How LeBron James wields too much power. How players shoot 3-pointers too much. How big men are becoming extinct. How players are too friendly. How the league is too soft. And, of course, how these kids are too entitled. \nAll of this is understandable when, say, Oscar Robertson says it … and he has . Oscar also played in the 1960s, three decades before this bunch. Oscar is 78. Oscar really is forgotten by much of the NBA’s core audience today. \nBut these guys are in their early 50s … or mid 40s. Or early 40s. Garnett is 40. And, as colleague Mike DeCourcy diplomatically pointed out , he entered the league as a teenager in 1995, straight out of high school, and for many instantly became the face of a generation of players who were, yes, ruining the game, because they didn’t know anything. \nMaybe it’s payback, albeit against the wrong targets. Maybe it’s guilt, from having to bear the burden of proving all that skepticism wrong. Maybe it’s paranoia because some 20-year-old is getting more attention in more places than they did at the same age, and they fear being left behind before their time. \nMaybe it’s a genuine hole in how they believe they’re perceived, because they spent the prime of their careers in Jordan’s shadow and were annually denied a ring because of him. \nSomething has these guys cornering the market on salt, though. \nMORE: Barkley labels Dwyane Wade, Draymond Green \"AAU babies\" \nAnd it’s too bad, because they may or may not realize how revered they and their generation are, not only by those who were there to witness them, but by the ones that followed. \nJust look at how the \"kids\" they so revile jumped to the defense of Charles Oakley in the James Dolan fiasco. They took it personally, because they see Oak as one of theirs, as much as his own contemporaries do. \nThe alienated generation of the very recent ‘90s might be surprised by what they might see if they actually looked and listened to what’s going on in the sport, at every level. They'd see that nothing has been ruined, or killed, or become the worst of anything. \nBut that can’t happen if all they ever do is look back … in anger.
