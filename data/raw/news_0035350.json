On violence? On graphic content? On profanity? What you decide will be your personal settings,\" he explained.\n\"For those who don't make a decision, the default will be whatever the majority of people in your region selected, like a referendum.\n\"It's worth noting that major advances in AI are required to understand text, photos and videos to judge whether they contain hate speech, graphic violence, sexually explicit content, and more.\n\"At our current pace of research, we hope to begin handling some of these cases in 2017, but others will not be possible for many years.\"\nThe plan was welcomed by the Family Online Safety Institute, a member of Facebook's own safety advisory board. The charity had previously criticised the social network for allowing beheading videos to be seen without any warning on its site.\n\"This letter further demonstrates that Facebook has been responsive to concerns and is working hard to prevent and respond to abuse and inappropriate material on the platform,\" said Jennifer Hanley, Fosi's vice president of legal and policy.\n\"I also really like the ability for users to customise their own experiences with these developments. It's important to give users power over their online experiences, and additional tools and controls will be helpful.\"\nRead Kamal Ahmed's interview with Mark Zuckerberg", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/F88C/production/_94682636_zuckerberg.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37318040", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22368287", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38998884", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30200311", "https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-global-community/10154544292806634"], "published": "2017-02-17T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:47:05.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
