ADVERTISEMENT \nIn real life, however, they ended up not just breaking up, but testily hinting at the unclear rankling issues that had soured their heretofore super-sweet relationship, some of them possibly financial in nature. Uh, oh, when money matters muddle the picture—love flies out of the window. \nTrue enough, love has ended with a thud for Erich and Daniel, bereaving their “DanRich” tandem’s loyal followers and believers. Too bad, so sad for them, their idols eventually disbelieved in love eternal—from forever to for never in one, fell swoop! \nThe unkindest cut of all was that it had to happen before the day of hearts—not the time of year when romantic fantasy is rudely revealed to be a ruse! \nErich and Daniel will pick themselves up and move on to other welcoming and loving arms, as stellarly beautiful luminaries are wont to do—but, what about the disappointed members of their peanut gallery? How can they believe in love eternal again after this rude awakening and “betrayal”? \nThe answer, we hope, is that this latest head-bumping experience could be the knock on the noggin that will finally make them grow up and realize that there is no fantasy, no forever—and that rough, ramshackle reality is all we have to rely and fall back on! \nThat may have zero “kilig value,” but if we work with it, it could turn out to be worth the heart and the hurt. Besides, what other real option do we have? \nIt would be even better if the hard-knocks education and realization we get from a nonfantasticating view of life and love eventually forces us to grow up and find happiness not in escaping from reality, but in accepting it as the only truth we have to live—and learn to love! \nSports highlights \nANC’s 30-minute sports newscast, “Gametime,” is hosted by young sportscaster Migs Bustos, Monday to Friday, 9:30 p.m. He sums up the sports highlights of the day with fresh perspective and analysis. \nSegments include updates on athletes’ best stat lines of the day, social media reactions to games, “Stuff Happens” on the lighter side of sports, plus a preview of coming sports events.
