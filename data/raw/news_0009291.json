He's been warned to get his head down and make himself undroppable by the manager, something he hasn't managed to do yet. Anthony Martial. Wayne Rooney \nRooney divides United fan opinion like no other player with as many deeming the 31-year-old a liability as those who back him as a club legend. \nHe took the all-time goal scoring record with a moment of magic at Stoke City last month but that was just his second league goal of the season. \nTalk of a move to China of MLS remains stubbornly frequent and even the most avid Rooney fan would admit he is not the player he used to be. Luke Shaw \nMourinho had already criticised the left-back when he was Chelsea manager, opting not to pursue their interest in the then Southampton man due to his wage demands. \nThe relationship has not become any warmer since the Portuguese’s arrival at Old Trafford, with his fitness, injury record and form raising questions. Luke Shaw. \nShaw shone during Van Gaal’s time at United before a horrific double leg-break. The left-back slot that seemed his to keep for years is now up for grabs. Chris Smalling \nLike fellow England defender Shaw, Smalling impressed during Van Gaal’s torrid time in Manchester. \nHe was arguably England’s best centre-back last season and with summer signing Eric Bailly was expected to form a first-choice partnership. \nInjury then the form of Marcus Rojo and Phil Jones put paid to that. Jones' absence for the clash with Leicester this weekend could present him with an opportunity. Tim Fosu-Mensah. Timothy Fosu-Mensah \nThe young defender - who can play at right-back or centre-back - is caught in the middle ground between the under-23s and the first team. \nHis chance in the starting X1 against Wigan last week was met by relief and excitement in equal measure. \nHe has featured seven times this season - largely in the cups - but the versatile 19-year-old clearly still has some work to convince Mourinho to rely on him more regualrly.
