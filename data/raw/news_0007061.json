Go watch Resident Evil: The Final Chapter purely for the thrills. By Sreeju Sudhakaran | Published: February 1, 2017 8:39 pm comments \nAs an avid gamer, I have been a huge fan of the Resident Evil games, though not so much of the movie franchise. Many a times, I feel that the movies have only been made by the director Paul WS Anderson to make his better half Milla Jovovich relevant in Hollywood. Now that Resident Evil movie franchise is ending with Resident Evil: The Final Chapter , let’s check if Anderson provides the fans with a satisfying conclusion. \nHere’s our review… \nWhat’s it about \nThree weeks after the events of the last movie, Resident Evil: Retribution , Alice ( Milla Jovovich ) finds herself in the ruins of White House. There she faces the Red Queen, who asks her to return to the Hive and stop the mysteriously resurrected Dr Isaacs (Iain Glen) from releasing an airborne virus that will wipe off the rest of humanity. There is also the promise of taking revenge on another old nemesis Wesker (Shawn Roberts) that prods her to go on the mission. On the way, she is joined by a group of ragtag survivors, led by her old mate Claire (Ali Larter) as well as hordes of the undead and living nightmares. \nWhat’s hot \nIt’s very rare that a much derided movie series bid farewell a good note, but Resident Evil nearly manages to do that with The Final Chapter . It is easily a more polished and better plotted installment that serves a fitting conclusion to the long drawn and cumbersome series. The special effects are better this time, and there are some really cool shots in this one, especially the fighting sequences. The Mad Max inspired highway fight is one such scene. Jump scares are plenty, though at times we feel they overdo it. For fans of the game, you can certainly find a few recall moments, especially with the design of the monsters. Though humour is rare to find here, I loved that scene near the end of the movie where Alice and the villain calculate various ways to eliminate the other, like the multiple options in a videogame. Among the cast, Iain Glen (Ser Jorah Mormont from Game of Thrones ) stands out with a deliciously wicked performance as the megalomaniac suffering from Noah syndrome. Though she still falters when it comes to conveying emotions, Milla Jovovich delivers when it comes to kicking ass. The scene where she confronts her past is nicely done. \nWhat’s not \nAs expected, the premise is very generic, liberally taking inspirations from Hunger Games, Evil Dead 3 and even Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows . The surprises that the movie has to offer are easily guess-worthy and defy logic at times. With nothing new to say in the story, the scenes often look repetitive and humdrum. The BG score is sometimes thrilling sometimes too blaring. Apart from Glen, Jovovich, and to some extent, Larter, the rest of the cast are just to put up add the numbers. It’s sad to see a spunky Ruby Rose, seen in Orange is the New Black and xXx: Return of Xander Cage , wasted in a thankless role. After a couple of interesting action sequences in the first half, the climactic Big Boss fight is kinda bummer especially with the way how it all ends. For those who are newcomers to both the movie and videogame franchise, it might get difficult for you to follow things at times. \nWhat to do \nIf you have been an ardent fan of the Resident Evil franchise purely for the action sequences and zombie fights, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter is an entertaining ride for you for most of its runtime. Go purely for the thrills, not so much for the premise.
