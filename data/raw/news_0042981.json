Hide Caption 13 of 13 (CNN) The freedom found skiing on a mountain is often earned after lengthy journeys, airport hassles and time-consuming traffic. But what if flying to the slopes was simple? Certain ski resorts do offer this -- and not just the ones involving a helicopter lift from the nearest international airport. \"The benefit of private jet travel for ski trips is as much about time saving and convenience, as it is about luxury,\" says PrivateFly chief executive Adam Twidell. Here are nine of the best ski resorts that can by flown directly to, with airfields less than 10 miles from the ski lifts. Read More Courchevel, France Courchevel: A matter of yards from runway to slopes. Courchevel is the queen of the crop when it comes to flying straight to the slopes. Europe's highest tarmacked runway at 6,583 feet is just yards from the piste. Skiing is only a matter of minutes away from landing. The steeply sloping runway -- only 1,762 feet long -- means pilots must power up on landing, a counter intuitive move. \"Get it wrong and the runway has to close while they get a tractor to come down and tow you up,\" says Richard Lumb, director of Kaluma Travel . But make it intact, and the 372 miles and 166 lifts of the vast Les Trois Vallees ski area -- shared with Meribel, Val Thorens and Les Menuires -- are all conveniently close. So, too, are Courchevel's seven Michelin-starred restaurants, galaxy of five-star hotels, such as the Cheval Blanc and Les Airelles , and constellation of ultra-luxury chalets. Did you know? Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge chose Courchevel as the venue for a four-day ski break in March 2016.

Its mini airstrip, nestling among the firs, is just 1,332 feet long and can only cater for light aircraft. The Meribel valley has 100 miles of ski runs, stretching from up to the mighty Mont du Vallon at 9,685 feet, with a mix of easy, intermediate and daringly difficult slopes such as the Saulire couloirs, some of which access Courchevel. Meribel was founded in the 1930s by Briton Colonel Peter Lindsay, who decreed all the building must be sympathetic to the environment, hence the predominance of timber and chalets. The sole five-star hotel is Le Kaila , with its Michelin-starred restaurant, while Hotel Le Grand Coeur and Spa is a long-time favorite for deep-pocketed visitors. Did you know? Meribel hosted the ice hockey and the women's downhill at the 1992 Albertville Winter Olympics.

Medieval Zell am See occupies a picturesque spot on the western shore of Lake Zell at the base of a horseshoe-shaped mountain, the Schmittenh√∂he, with 48 miles of runs. The new zellamseeXpress gondola has opened up an old run into Glemmtal with plans to extend further towards Saalbach-Hinterglemm.

The historic Grand Hotel Zell am See sits on a lakeside peninsula, while the nearby Salzburgerhof has a five-star superior rating. Did you know? The Steinerwirt is rated as Zell am See's top restaurant on TripAdvisor, while the Crazy Daisy is a popular apres-ski spot. St. Moritz, Switzerland The term \"jet set\" could have been coined for the glitterati of St. Moritz . Private jets land at Samedan airfield in the Engadin valley, only four miles from the historic birthplace of winter tourism and the favorite alpine hangout for international moneybags, aristocrats and superstars. The 218 miles of ski runs and 58 lifts in the Engadin valley are centered around St. Moritz's Corviglia area, which hosted the Winter Olympics in 1928 and 1948. The resort also provided the setting for the skiing scenes in James Bond flick \"The Spy Who Loved Me\".

Did you know? St. Moritz is home to the infamous Cresta Run toboggan course, first built in 1884, and the nearby Olympia bob run, the world's first and only naturally refrigerated bobsleigh track. The town also hosts an annual polo match and the \"White Turf\" horse race on the frozen lake.
