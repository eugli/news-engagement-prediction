In a report last year, Amnesty found that more than 17,000 people have died of torture and ill-treatment in custody across Syria since 2011, an average rate of more than 300 deaths a month. Comparable to battlefield deaths \nThose figures are comparable to battlefield deaths in Aleppo, one of the fiercest war zones in Syria, where 21,000 were killed in the province since 2011. \n\"The horrors depicted in this report reveal a hidden, monstrous campaign, authorized at the highest levels of the Syrian government, aimed at crushing any form of dissent within the Syrian population,\" Maalouf said. 'These executions take place after a sham trial that lasts over a minute or two minutes, but they are authorized by the highest levels of authority' - Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International \nWhile the most recent data is from 2015, Maalouf said there is no reason to believe the practice has stopped since then, with thousands more probably killed. \n\"These executions take place after a sham trial that lasts over a minute or two minutes, but they are authorized by the highest levels of authority,\" including the Grand Mufti, a top religious authority in Syria, and the defence minister, she said. \nSyrian government officials rarely comment on allegations of torture and mass killings. In the past, they have denied reports of massacres documented by international human rights groups, describing them as propaganda. \nThe chilling accounts in Tuesday's report came from interviews with 31 former detainees and over 50 other officials and experts, including former guards and judges. \nAccording to the findings, detainees were told they would be transferred to civilian detention centres but were taken instead to another building in the facility and hanged. Scenes of death \n\"They walked in the 'train,' so they had their heads down and were trying to catch the shirt of the person in front of them. The first time I saw them, I was horrified. They were being taken to the slaughterhouse,\" Hamid, a former detainee, told Amnesty. \nHeld above the \"execution room,\" Hamid got used to hearing other prisoners die. \n\"If you put your ears on the floor, you could hear the sound of a kind of gurgling. This would last around 10 minutes… We were sleeping on top of the sound of people choking to death. This was normal for me then,\" he said. \nThe hangings took place once or twice a week, the report states. Prisoners remain blindfolded and don't know how or when they will die until there is a noose around their necks. \n\"They kept them [hanging] there for 10 to 15 minutes,\" a former judge who witnessed the hangings said. \"Some didn't die because they are light. For the young ones, their weight wouldn't kill them. The officers' assistants would pull them down and break their necks.\" \nAnother former detainee, Omar Alshogre, told The Associated Press the guards would come to his cell, sometimes three times a week, and call out detainees by name. \nAlshogre said a torture session would begin before midnight in nearby chambers that he could hear.

(Omar Alshogre/Handout/Associated Press) \n\"Then the sound would stop, and we would hear a big vehicle come and take them away,\" said Alshogre, who spent nine months in Saydnaya. Now 21, he lives in Sweden. \nSpeaking in an interview from Stockholm via Skype, Alshogre described how he was forced to keep his eyes closed and his back to the guards while they abused or suffocated a cellmate. \nThe body often would be left behind, or there would be a pool of blood in the cell for other prisoners to clean up. \n\"We can tell from the sound of the prisoner as he dies behind us. He dies a metre away. I don't see anything, but I see with my ears,\" said Alshogre, who at age 17 moved among nearly 10 detention facilities in Syria for two years before landing in Saydnaya. \nAlshogre survived nine months in the prison, paying his way out in 2015 — a common practice. He suffered from tuberculosis and his weight had fallen to 77 pounds. \nAt one point, Alshogre was called out by his guards \"for execution,\" he said. He was brought before a military trial and told not to raise his gaze at the judge, who asked him how many soldiers he had killed. \nWhen he said none, the judge spared him.
