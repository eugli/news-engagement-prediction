He said the estate was working closely with police to ensure those responsible were caught and brought to justice.\nNgxongo said the intruders had entered the estate through a remote, yet secured gate, that was only used during storms and flooding.\n“The gate was securely padlocked, however, police believe that the lock had been broken to gain entrance,” he said.\n“The estate has never had anything like this happen before and we are all completely flummoxed.\n“They were perfectly harmless and we are concerned that something like this has happened.”\nHe said the estate had posted guards at every single gate at the estate with more guards patrolling the residential side of the gated community.\n“It is so bizarre. We just don’t get such brutal and violent crime such as this in the Midlands.\n“Everyone is very upset, however, we are being proactive in protecting the homeowners and the hotel is open to the people living on the estate if they need anything,” he said.\nNottingham Road Land Owners Association chairperson Clive Foss said the organisation was “extremely concerned” about the incident, and sent their sincerest condolences to the Solik family.\nFoss said they were working closely with police and local security companies to assist in any way possible.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=2006109277&t=artid%3d7c150b99-9021-454e-ad85-68c6a0cafdd1%26Places%3dpietermaritzburg%26Topics%3dcrime%2cfarm+attacks%26accreditation%3dthe+witness%26posno%3d1", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=2006109277&t=artid%3d7c150b99-9021-454e-ad85-68c6a0cafdd1%26Places%3dpietermaritzburg%26Topics%3dcrime%2cfarm+attacks%26accreditation%3dthe+witness%26posno%3d1"], "published": "2017-02-20T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T19:45:30.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
