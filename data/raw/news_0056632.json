They didn't have any interior services whatsoever,\" she said. \"Yet, they were able to create this very important volume capturing our native flowers.\"\nAn original wildflower painting by Canadian artist Agnes Fitzgibbons.

There were 500 copies on the original pre-subscription order available at $5 a copy.\nLeGeyt said Fitzgibbons was widowed with eight children, and she and her kids tediously hand-painted more than 5,000 blooms.\nOne of her daughters, Geraldine Moodie, went on to become a renowned photographer focused on capturing the lives of Indigenous people.\n\"As a 12-year-old, she was probably imbued with her mother's creative energy,\" LeGeyt said.\nAgnes Fitzgibbons painted by hand more than 5,000 flowers for her book Canadian Wild Flowers. (Barry Smith/CBC)\nParr Trail kept a herbarium, where she pressed and dried different plant specimens. She learned about the plants from Indigenous people in Canada. \"She was very keen that other people learn about these particular plants,\" LeGeyt said.  \nThe paintings are available to view on request at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library.\n\"They were done 150 years ago, and marking   celebration, this is a very, very good story,\" LeGeyt said.  \nTen original paintings by Agnes Fitzgibbons delighted botanical artists attending a \"When Art Meets Science\" lecture at the University of Toronto Tuesday.
