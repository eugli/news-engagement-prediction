This is important history, not yet told.\"\nRELATED: New Smithsonian Digital Exhibition Honors Japanese-American WWII Veterans\nDirected by Alexander Bocchieri, the film features actors Ban Daisuke (\"Jinzo Ningen Kikaida\"), Peter Shinkoda (\"Daredevil\"), Cole Horibe (\"So You Think You Can Dance\"), and Tashima (\"Under the Blood Red Sun\"). The film also features the music of ukulele virtuoso Jake Shimabukuro.\nThe story follows a group of University of Hawaii ROTC students after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor as they face distrust and discrimination in Hawaii, and as they form the Varsity Victory Volunteers (VVV), which leads to the formation of the 100th and 442nd.\n\"It's my hope that [this film] will create a dialog that helps to heal old wounds in survivors, and that later generations such as my own, as well as Americans of other ethnicities, will stop and think about what being American really means,\" Stacey Hayashi, the film's writer and executive producer, told NBC News. \"I hope we can all better appreciate that our strength lies in our diversity, and in unity of our beliefs in freedom and equality for all. Fear and racism aren't good for anyone or any country, but they really have no place in America, a nation of immigrants.\"\nFilming began in December, immediately after the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and is largely complete. One still — in which 17,000 bid aloha to military volunteers at Iolani Palace, the former royal residence of the Kingdom of Hawaii — remains to be to be shot and is scheduled for April, Hayashi said. Afterward, all that remains is post-production, for which the project is currently fundraising .\nThe film is expected to be released in 2017.\nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and Tumblr .", "external_links": ["https://www.goforbrokemovie.com/donate", "https://www.goforbrokemovie.com/", "http://www.twitter.com/nbcasianamerica", "http://www.instagram.com/nbcasianamerica", "http://www.facebook.com/nbcasianamerica"], "published": "2017-02-17T21:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T19:05:44.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
