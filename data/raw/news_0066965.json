Musk anticipates that 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and Model X vehicles combined will be delivered to customers combined during the first half of the year. “We are on track to generate $500M in cash (including growth of non-recourse project financing) by 2019,” he wrote. \nHere are other interesting things we learned from the earnings results: \nRelated: If You Crash Your Tesla to Save a Life, Elon Musk Might Foot the Bill \n1. Leadership change The company announced that Tesla CFO Jason Wheeler will be leaving the company in April and will be replaced by his predecessor, Deepak Ahuja, who took on the job in 2008 and left in 2015. \nWheeler said of his departure in a statement from the company: “After spending the last 15 years helping to make information accessible to everyone and to advance sustainable energy, I’m looking forward to continuing to champion these causes and others from a public policy perspective.” \n2. Inclusive packages On an earnings phone call, Jeff Evanson, the company’s VP of investor relations, said that Tesla has begun offering customers in Asia the option of buying a vehicle with the price of maintenance and insurance included, with plans to provide that choice in other markets. \n3. DIY repairs In his letter to shareholders, Musk wrote that the company had plans to grow its service that lets drivers make repairs at their workplace or home as “80 percent of our repairs are so minor that they can be done remotely.” \nRelated: Elon Musk Personally Cancels 'Super Rude' Customer's Tesla Model X Order \n4. More Gigafactories The company will also be working towards building three more battery factories. “Installation of Model 3 manufacturing equipment is underway in Fremont and at Gigafactory 1, where in January, we began production of battery cells for energy storage products, which have the same form-factor as the cells that will be used in Model 3,” Musk wrote. “Later this year, we expect to finalize locations for Gigafactories 3, 4 and possibly 5 (Gigafactory 2 is the Tesla solar plant in New York).” \n5. Labor issues After allegations of mandatory overtime and long hours, Musk said that he did not believe that Tesla factory workers at the Fremont, Calif., plant would unionize and that he was planning to publish his findings about working conditions soon. One stat he reported was that the injury rate in Tesla’s factories was less than half of the car industry average. Nina Zipkin Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.
