Most of the rallies are scheduled for Saturday, when larger crowds are expected.\nRaucous rallies, often filling sports arenas, became a hallmark of Trump's presidential campaign, in contrast with lower-key events staged by Clinton.\nEarlier this month, Trump rekindled that energy for the first time since his election in a freewheeling rally in Melbourne, Florida.\nBut Trump's crowds have rarely regrouped since November's election, while large protests by people who oppose Trump's policies, particularly his crackdown on immigration, have become more frequent.\n(Additional reporting by Jonathan Allen in New York, Shannon Stapleton in Mandeville, Louisiana, Keith Coffman in Denver and Olga Grigoryants in Brea, California; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Dan Whitcomb)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:34:28.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
