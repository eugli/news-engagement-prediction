They might not agree with every aspect of his agenda, but they recognize his efforts in pushing some major conservative initiatives such as the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court, repealing and replacing Obamacare, and rebuilding the U.S. relationship with Israel. \nConservatives acknowledge that President Trump is not a purist, and establishment conservatives have criticized him on issues such as infrastructure spending and trade. \nBut even the conservative establishment can agree that Mr. Trump is making a concerted effort to keep his campaign promises.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T12:45:28.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
