Also known as modern-day cricket's Superman, the stylish right-hander is regarded as one of South Africa's best batsman ever and he has proved it by holding many batting records in international cricket. \nHe is called Mr. 360° because of his ability to hit the ball over the boundary anywhere in the field. May it be hitting a monstrous six over behind the square or over the third man, he has done it all. \nThe Superman of Cricket holds the record for fastest 50 (16 balls), 100 (31 balls) and 150 (64 balls) in an ODI. He has also hit the most number of sixes in an ODI innings (16 sixes) and he is also the fastest player to reach 8000 ODI runs. \nApart from his terrific batting performances, AB is also a live wire on the field. \nThis incredible run-out by him against Australia is completely etched in every cricket fan's mind. \n\nSouth Africa was hosting Australia at St George's Park and Adam Gilchrist and Simon Katich were set on the field. It was during Andrew Hall's over, when South Africa got rid off Katich, thanks to the extraordinary effort from de Villiers. \nKatich hit the ball to mid-off and rushed for a single, AB dived and threw the ball to the bowler's end while rolling on the ground, much to the disbelief of his team-mates and Katich. \nThe explosive batsman makes every match an interesting one to watch with his ability to sail balls over the rope. His unique technique and completely unorthodox style of play has even impressed the great Sachin Tendulkar, who also wished him on his birthday. When it comes to unorthodox shots, very few people can ace it like @ABdeVilliers17 . Happy birthday Mr. 360°, have a splendid one! \n— sachin tendulkar (@sachin_rt) February 17, 2017 \nHaving missed international cricket due to his struggle with injuries lately, de Villiers was back in South Africa's limited-overs squad for the series against Sri Lanka. Since his return, he has already hit three fifties.
