Tip is set for 7 p.m. on ESPN, which will also stream the game via WatchESPN.com. Check out this 247 preview to get you ready for the game. \nTwo storylines to monitor \n1. Confidence in Confidence Alone \nJohn Calipari doesn’t expect his players to do more than which they are capable, but he is demanding a more confident approach from his team. Associate head coach Kenny Payne is keeping a watchful eye on the Cats’ body language on the court, and “if a player is not playing with confidence, either on defense or offense,” Calipari said, “Kenny’s just taking them out.” \n“You can miss a shot – confidently miss a shot, confidently play defense. But if you’re out there (with wide eyes) and you don’t breathe for four minutes at a time, you shouldn’t be out there,” Calipari said. “Be confident. Get yourself in practice, work on it, walk in that game knowing, ‘I want to play and I’m going to play confident.’” \n2. No Swiping \nFor the first half of this season, De'Aaron Fox appeared poised to make a run at the single-season assist record set last season by Tyler Ulis . But the freshman point guard’s numbers have tapered off over the last six games, when he’s dished 2.6 assists per compared to 6.6 over UK’s first 17 contests. Calipari thinks the illness that forced Fox to miss Kentucky’s win over Georgia “zapped him a little bit,” but pointed to a lapse in defensive intensity as the real issue behind Fox’s recent decline. \n“The biggest issue, if you look, is the way he played the ball and bothered the ball and defended, he looked like Tyler Ulis ,” Fox said. “He backed up a little bit off that. That’s the number one weapon he has. And then the second weapon is his speed. Those are effort things. You gotta do that first.” \nFour Tennessee players to watch \n1. Robert Hubbs III \nSenior, Guard \n2016-17 Stats: 14.3 points, 5.0 rebounds \nBio Buzz: The Vols’ leading scorer torched Kentucky for 25 points on 9-of-14 shooting in the meeting in Knoxville, the fourth-most points scored by any player to face UK this season. Hubbs (6-5, 207) ranks fourth in the SEC in field goal percentage (.488), but has made just 29.2 percent of his shot attempts (12 of 41) over the last four games. He is 34 points shy of becoming the 48th player in Tennessee history to reach 1,000 points. \nFreshman, Guard \n2016-17 Stats: 12.5 points, 5.5 rebounds \nBio Buzz: Williams has reached double figures in nine of his last 10 outings (14.3 points per game in SEC play), capped by a career-high 30 points on 10-of-16 shooting in Tennessee’s loss to Georgia on Saturday. In the Vols’ win over Kentucky on Jan. 24, Williams (6-5, 234) scored 13 points on 5-of-8 shooting – including a bucket with 14 seconds left that put UT ahead 80-75 – and dished a career-high six assists. He has blocked 49 shots this season – four in the last meeting vs. UK – the most ever by a Tennessee freshman. \n3. Lamonté Turner \nRedshirt Freshman, Guard \n2016-17 Stats: 8.8 points, 3.2 assists \nBio Buzz: In addition to leading the Vols in assists, Turner has made the most 3-pointers for UT this season (36 of 96), knocking down two in the final 50 seconds vs. Georgia. Turner (6-0, 187) hasn’t reached double figures since scoring 10 against Kentucky, when he also pulled down a career-high seven rebounds, three more than he’s had in any other game in 2016-17. In the Vols’ come-from-behind win over Ole Miss, Turner scored five of his nine points in the final 4:15, hitting two free throws with 34 seconds left to seal the victory. \nSophomore, Guard \n2016-17 Stats: 7.3 points, 3.9 rebounds \nBio Buzz: After averaging 3.5 points during UT’s non-conference schedule, Schofield is scoring 10.3 points per game in SEC play. Schofield (6-4, 238) has made at least one 3-pointer in six of the Vols’ last seven contests while shooting 61.5 percent (8 of 13) from outside during that span. Against Kentucky on Jan. 24, Schofield scored 15 points and grabbed seven boards in 27 minutes. \nSeven notes to keep in mind \n1. Kentucky leads the all-time series over Tennessee 152-69, including a 89-16 record in Lexington. Rick Barnes holds a 4-3 edge in head-to-head matchups vs. John Calipari . \n2. The Vols have won only four games in Rupp Arena since it opened in 1976, the most recent a 75-67 victory on Feb. 7, 2006. Tennessee has not swept UK since the 1998-99 season. \n3. Tennessee is 9-0 this season when scoring 80 points, including the 82-80 victory over UK on Jan. 24. The Vols have reached the 80-point mark in four of their last seven SEC games. \n4. Kentucky was outscored in the paint by Tennessee 42-28 earlier this season. The Vols shot 53.3 percent in the second half, the fourth of the now nine straight opponents to shoot better than 50 percent vs. UK after halftime. \n5. Isaiah Briscoe leads Kentucky with four double-doubles this season, all of which have come in SEC play, including three in the last six games. Against Tennessee on Jan. 24, Briscoe scored 11 points on 5-of-12 shooting and grabbed a career-high 14 rebounds. \n6. Malik Monk has made 79 3-pointers this season, 38 shy of Jodie Meeks’ single-season program record. \n7. Kentucky, Florida and South Carolina are tied for first place in the SEC with six games to go. The Gators visit Auburn (16-9, 5-7) on Tuesday, while the Gamecocks host Arkansas (18-7, 7-5) on Wednesday.
