The TAJK banners have been displayed in Lahore and other cities and towns. \n\nThe group is also planning to hold a big Kashmir conference tomorrow in Lahore after evening prayers. \n\nThe TAJK has reactivated its donations centres and ambulance services in different districts of Punjab, including Lahore, which is the hub of its activities. \n\nLocal media reported that even after the crackdown on their activities, the volunteers of Saeed's network yesterday actively participated in the rescue operation after a boat carrying about 100 passengers capsized in the Ravi river near Nankana Sahib town in Punjab. \n\nA police official said law enforcement agencies were keeping a close eye on the activities of Saeed's network and appropriate action would be taken. \n\n\"It is a sensitive issue and a measured response is needed to fulfill the international obligations of the country and deal with any possible fallout due to protest by followers of Saeed,\" he said. \n\nVarious offices of both JuD and FIF were closed on Monday following the house arrest of Saeed. Both organisations were also put on observation under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. \n\nThe government on Monday had placed Saeed and his four accomplices -- Abdullah Ubaid, Zafar Iqbal, Abdur Rehman Abid and Qazi Kashif Niaz -- under house arrest in Lahore. \n\nThe Interior Ministry had also placed Saeed and 37 other JuD and FIF members on the Exit Control List (ECL), barring them from leaving the country.
