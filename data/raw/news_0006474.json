Rec Photo by Bob Levey/Getty Images Tom Brady’s mother, Galynn, has been dealing with health issues for the past 18 months, and it has been a big source of concern and stress for Brady, according to CSNNE . His mother’s health might also explain why Brady was emotional at Super Bowl Opening Night when asked who his hero was, and he responded with his dad. Tom Brady nearly brought to tears at Super Bowl media event after answering 7-year-old boy's question asking who his hero was: \"My dad.\" pic.twitter.com/eVBfpgDTnp — ABC News (@ABC) January 31, 2017 When asked about his heartfelt response, Brady said via NESN , “You just have different things that your family goes through throughout the course of your life. It has been a challenging year for my family for some personal reasons.” That turned out to be telling about his mother’s health. “It will be nice to have everyone here watching us this weekend,” Brady added. “My mom and dad, they have been so supportive my entire life, and it is nice to be here to show them and try to make them proud.” Brady said that his mom hasn’t been able to attend any games this season, and added, “My dad has been to one. That’s very atypical. They’re going to be here this weekend, which I’m excited about. It’ll be nice to see everybody. I’ve got a big crew coming.” Galynn has often been credited with the Brady family’s athletic success. Sure, Tom is a four-time Super Bowl champion, but his three sisters were all great softball players. CSNNE says that despite her illness, she was able to play nine holes of golf recently. The news of Galynn’s health could be an indicator of why Brady decided to not continue to battle Deflategate. Her health is more important, and while suspended, Brady had more time to spend with his family.
