It was, perhaps, the highlight of the San Diego Padres ’ season. On Monday, Petco Park was underwater. \nThat is not a metaphor for the poor state of the Padres. Petco Park was really underwater: Good thing @Padres are in Arizona for #Springtraining --- Petco Park flooded today https://t.co/YxeVwo8kqA pic.twitter.com/EhsVhA2CQb \nHere’s the Padres’ official explanation, courtesy of FOX 5 : \nSan Diego Padres spokeswoman Shana Wilson told FOX 5 an amount of rain had fallen so quickly the drainage was slow to keep up. Field crews do not anticipate any damage from the standing water. \nThe Padres also noted there was not grass on the field because of a recently hosted monster-truck rally. Presumably, Petco will be in better shape come March 14. That’s when the Padres’ ballpark is set to host the second round of the World Baseball Classic. The second round at Petco lasts until March 18 or 19.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:59:25.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
