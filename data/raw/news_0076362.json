We see a massive potential. The population in Nigeria is big; the insurance penetration is big; they are 70 million formally employed people in Nigeria. \n“It is bigger than any of the markets that we have presence in Africa. It is bigger than Ghana and bigger than South Africa. In South Africa, the entire population is 50 million, but in Nigeria, the people that are employed are 70 million, so it is a very exciting market for us. \n“Our plan is to grow massively. Right now, we are sort of maybe at the bottom of the middle, in the next five years, we want to be among the top five in the market. Definitely, that is where are going to be.” Tony ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:30:38.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
