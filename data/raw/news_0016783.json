The panel on Tuesday displayed as evidence during presentation the cash allegedly paid by Gov Wike in order to influence the results of the election in favour of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) It would be recalled that Wike who had on several occasions denied rigging the elections set up his own Judicial Commission of Inquiry to investigate irregularities after accusing the All Progressive Congress, APC, of election malpractices. He had also approached a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja to stop the Police probe but his plea was rejected by the court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T15:38:17.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
