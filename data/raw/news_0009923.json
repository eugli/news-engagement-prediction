TNN | Updated: Feb 3, 2017, 12.10 PM IST Anjali Lama is the first Nepali transgender model to walk the Indian ramp. She made her grand debut at Lakme Fashion Week this year. From walking the ramp for Monisha Jaising to wearing a bright green sari for Sanjukta Dutta’s show, Anjali Lama is taking the Indian ramp by storm. In an interview with Bombay Times, Anjali Lama talked about how India is more receptive to sexual inclusivity. She was quoted as saying, “India is a little above Nepal when it comes to development, and people are by and large helpful. In fact, that's what triggered my decision to come here and explore career opportunities. Indians are far more broadminded and receptive.” After the Fashion Week, she has big plans to settle in Mumbai. “This city has given me hope and love in the most profuse way possible. I am planning to join an agency to strengthen my portfolio,” adds Anjali.
