The message was being sent by a LiDAR supplier. \nLiDAR is a sensor used in self-driving cars and the two companies -- Waymo and Otto are owned by Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Uber respectively, both developing their own version of self-driving automobiles. Though Waymo spun off into a different company out of Google's self-driving project cooked in the Google X Moonshot factory, Otto was a startup -- formed by ex-Google car and Maps employees Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron -- later acquired by Uber for $680 million in August last year. \nNow Waymo has filed a lawsuit against Otto for stealing trade secrets and patent infringement. Waymo came to know about the matter from the e-mail sent to its employee that was allegedly written to Otto by its LiDAR supplier. The LiDAR circuit board designs, Waymo claims, are very similar to its own, highly confidential, propriety designs for which it had been awarded several patents and which was a closely guarded trade secret. \nWaymo claims Levandowski stole more than 1400 of these files before he resigned from Google which had confidential information and Waymo's LiDAR circuit board designs.

LiDAR uses laser light instead of Radio waves. Developed and deployed in recent years for self-driving cars, they can generate a 3-dimensional map of space around the car with amazing accuracy, that would help it navigate. Waymo places it atop its self-driving cars, at the beacon-position. \nGoogle engineers eventually developed and perfected the LiDAR technology even before Waymo came into being. It recently developed two new categories of LiDAR -- a short range and a long range LiDAR -- that along with the medium range sensor is said to be industry's best.

It recently rolled out its self-driving car fleet in its hometown of San Francisco on Wednesday without permit from the authorities and continued testing the cars despite repeated warnings. California Department of Motor Vehicles eventually revoked the registration of 16 Uber self-driving cars before they were taken off the road.
