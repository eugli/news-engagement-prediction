As the series continues its seventh season, the hit drama was experienced a dip in ratings since its explosive premiere, but the show’s network is not so concerned about the slide. Earlier today, AMC Networks shared it Q4 earnings with the world, and the company bolster its pockets with 13% more revenue. So, really, it’s not surprising to hear that AMC wants The Walking Dead to live a long, long time. \nAs reported by The Hollywood Reporter , the CEO of AMC Networks was optimistic in his reports about the franchise’s future. \"The show continues to have creative strength and command a large and loyal audience, which has in turn attracted ad revenue to our great benefit,\" Josh Sapan said. \n\" The Walking Dead remains the No. 1 show on television among younger viewers by a very wide margin. Beyond advertising, The Walking Dead is illustrative of the benefits of owned franchise content. The Walking Dead is a franchise that will deliver ancillary revenues over different distribution platforms for many years to come as it does today. And we believe it will have a long life that accrues to our strategic position and financial benefit. ” \nThen, in the company’s earnings report, Saban reiterated, ” The Walking Dead remains the number 1 show on television by a wide margin and is a powerful example of programming that we own and distribute that commands a loyal audience, attracts advertising revenue, and has significant ancillary revenues that will benefit our business for years to come. With a rapidly expanding studio business, we now have a growing portfolio of shows that we own that provide this kind of opportunity for our business.\" \nOf course, fans have suspected The Walking Dead would continue so long as its success remains stable. Last year, the series’ creator commented on the fate of The Walking Dead in a recent comic issue. Robert Kirkman hinted that there was no reason to slow down any part of the franchise. \n\"It took us 6 seasons to get to 100,\" Kirkman wrote. \"It won’t take us 6 years to get to 200 and that will take us to season … TWELVE. And we’ll still be ahead of the show at that point.\" \nSo, what do you think? How would you like to see The Walking Dead continue its growth over the years?
