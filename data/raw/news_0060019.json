The state later consented to new sentencing proceedings in the five other cases. After Mr. Cornyn left office, the state continued to seek to execute Mr. Buck. His case was different, prosecutors said, because Mr. Buck’s own lawyer — rather than prosecutors — had presented Dr. Quijano’s testimony. But Chief Justice Roberts said that only made the problem worse. “No competent defense attorney would introduce such evidence about his own client,” he wrote, noting that Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. had said much the same thing in a 2011 opinion at an earlier stage of the case. Back then, Justice Alito wrote that the case “concerns bizarre and objectionable testimony.” In dissent on Wednesday, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Alito, said, “Texas had good reason for treating this case differently from the others.” “This is the only one” of the six cases, Justice Thomas wrote, quoting from Justice Alito’s 2011 opinion, “where ‘it can be said that the responsibility for eliciting the offensive testimony lay squarely with the defense.’” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But Chief Justice Roberts wrote that an expert presented by the defense had special force. “When a defendant’s own lawyer puts in the offending evidence, it is in the nature of an admission against interest, more likely to be taken at face value,” he wrote. One of Mr. Buck’s trial lawyers, Jerry Guerinot, has a dismal record in death penalty cases , having represented 20 people sentenced to death in Texas, more than are awaiting execution in about half of the states that have the death penalty. The case reached the Supreme Court on the narrow question of whether a federal appeals court should have allowed Mr. Buck to appeal a challenge to his death sentence. But Chief Justice Roberts’s opinion answered larger questions, too, ruling that Mr. Buck’s lawyers had been ineffective and had prejudiced him, making him entitled to a new sentencing hearing. In his dissent, Justice Thomas said the majority had been so eager to reach its “desired outcome” that it had bulldozed procedural obstacles and misapplied settled law. As a consequence, the decision in the case, Buck v. Davis, No. 15-8049, “has few ramifications, if any beyond the highly unusual facts presented here,” Justice Thomas wrote. Justice Thomas described Mr. Buck’s murders in detail, suggesting that they were proof enough that he remained dangerous and saying that Chief Justice Roberts had relied “on rhetoric and speculation to craft a finding of prejudice.” \nFollow Adam Liptak on Twitter @adamliptak .
