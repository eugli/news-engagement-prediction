The home at 1878 N. Orchard Street, a modest worker cottage surrounded by newly constructed mansions, will soon be demolished to make way for a new residence at the site. A demolition permit issued last week has signaled that the house will soon be cleared from the property. The house, which is representative of the housing stock that was more typically found in Lincoln Park after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, was built in 1890 according to real estate listings . While it’s not exactly uncommon to find these worker cottages throughout North Side neighborhoods along the lakefront, they are becoming increasingly rare as developers scoop them up to build newer, larger homes in their place. The house listed in January as vacant land asking $2.699 million. In the listing notes, the agent described the property as a “once in a lifetime opportunity for extra wide landlocked lot on one of Lincoln parks top streets.” The sale closed just a couple of days later on January 18, fetching $2.5 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:26:44.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
