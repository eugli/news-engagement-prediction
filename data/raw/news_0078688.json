But the Academy Awards is one of those few occasions that calls for a double feature on the fashion front. The best alternatives to awards show attire underscored several key fashion trends. Several of the running themes of the evening drew upon a directional approach to color—or lack thereof. Several stars demonstrated that a monochromatic palette in black or white can be just as convincing as those on the primary side of the shade spectrum. Others doubled up in a mix of metallics and fringe; much like the mark of a winning Oscars wardrobe—why settle for just one statement piece when you can have several? Here, we highlight the four trends that dominated the after-parties. White Hot A quick-change needn't break the bank, as demonstrated by Rooney Mara in H&M. Naomie Harris also let her hair down so to speak, with a breezy goddess gown in a minimalist palette. Michelle Dockery in Roland Mouret and Ruth Negga in Oscar de la Renta followed suit with smattering embellishments for a different visual element. Dark Romance Dakota Johnson and Priyanka Chopra doubled down on plunging necklines and pitch-perfect black, In Gucci and Michael Kors, respectively. Hannah Bronfman took the drama one step further in a transparent Off-White allover lace look, and Lily Collins rolled both elements into one feathered-and-embellished Elie Saab Couture confection. Painterly Colors Several mastered the art of approachable primary colors: Sarah Paulson slipped into a velvety citron style from Ronald van der Kemp, Brie Larson in Ralph & Russo and Kate Bosworth J. Mendel took a shining to jewel tones. Bold color knows no bounds or age, as evidenced by Olivia Munn and Isabelle Huppert. Munn, 36, wrapped up in a high-neck Giambattista Valli gown while Huppert, 63, opted for a see-through Armani blouse and matching skirt instead. Fringe Benefits Leave it to Katy Perry to pull out all the sartorial stops. The singer dazzled in Jean Paul Gaultier’s glittering fringe flapper dress in metallic bronze. Thandie Newton hit a similar note in a silver Schiaparelli Couture slip that boasted fringed-and-beaded sculptural shoulders.
