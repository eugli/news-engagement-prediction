Of those who reported being cyberbullied, 37 per cent were girls and 29 per cent were boys who said they had faced online harassment “at least once in the previous year,” according to a survey showing numbers from 2014. \nB.C Premier Christy Clark kicks a soccer ball while attending an Erase Bullying in Sport event in collaboration with Pink Shirt Anti-Bullying Day in Burnaby, B.C., on Wednesday, February 22, 2017. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ben Nelms Story continues below \nSurvey respondents aged 15 and over were asked whether they had been victimized online. \nAbout half of female victims (48 per cent) said they had been targeted by “threatening or aggressive comments spread through group emails, instant messages or postings on Internet sites,” next to 29 per cent of boys. \nMeanwhile, almost 30 per cent of female victims said they faced other forms of cyberbullying, such as having threatening or embarrassing photos shared with other people, or their identity stolen in order to post information about them. Twenty-six per cent of boys reported experiencing this kind of bullying. Family violence \nGirls also made up a higher proportion of victims of family violence that had been reported to the police. \nFamily violence was defined as a broad cross-section of criminal offences, including homicide, sexual violence and uttering threats, in which the victim had either been related to the perpetrator, or else been their foster child or adopted daughter or son. \nAt 289.1 per 100,000 population, girls faced a higher likelihood of family violence, while for boys it was 189.7 per 100,000 population, in 2014.

It was 534.6 per 100,000 population for girls and 247.5 per 100,000 population for boys. \nGirls were particularly over-represented when it came to sexual violence. At 121.8 per 100,000 population, the rate was four times higher for girls than it was for boys (28.5 per 100,000 population). \nThis chart shows police-reported family violence rates in all provinces and territories for 2014. Statistics Canada \nThe rate of police-reported family violence against girls was highest in Nunavut, where it was 1,840 per 100,000 population in 2014. \nBut the gulf between family violence against boys and girls was widest in the Yukon. The rate was 2.4 times higher for girls than it was for boys. Mental health \nGirls generally reported higher stress at various ages, too. \nJust over 17 per cent of girls aged 12 to 17 years old reported that their lives were stressful on most days. That was twice as many as it was for boys (9.3 per cent). \nHigh levels of stress were more likely among girls aged 15 to 17, as 23.5 per cent of them reported experiencing stress on most days, more than double the amount for boys (11.8 per cent). \nAlmost twice as many girls aged 15 to 17 reported having been diagnosed with a mood disorder (7.3 per cent) as boys of the same age did (3.8 per cent). \nAnxiety disorders were also more common among 15-to-17-year-old girls (9.6 per cent) than boys (6.3 per cent). \nREAD MORE: Viral video of fight at Vaudreuil high school raises questions about bullying \nSome school experiences, however, brought more positive stats for girls. \nGirls were more confident about their achievement in school at various age levels. About 80 per cent of 11-year-old girls rated their scholarly achievement as “good” or “very good,” compared to 75 per cent of boys. \nThis level dropped to 75 per cent for 13-year-old girls, though that was still higher than it was for boys of that age (66 per cent). \nSeventy-one per cent of 15-year-old girls, meanwhile, thought highly of their achievement in school, compared to 64 per cent of boys. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
