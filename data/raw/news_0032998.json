They get her to a room, and Valentin explains what happened. Anna begins to wake up, but her vision is blurry and reflexes weak.

Nathan heads upstairs to surprise Nina, who is still waiting for Valentin. Nathan begs Nina to give Maxie a second chance and points out that she needs her to ground her out-of-the-box visions. Suddenly Maxie bangs on the door and asks Nina to open. Nina does, and Maxie sees Nathan in the room and assumes Nina’s trying to sway him to her side. Nina explains Nathan almost convinced her to hire Maxie back, but now she sees that’s impossible. Maxie tells Nina she’s sure she can run Crimson, and then mumbles, “right into the ground.” Nathan takes Maxie to the hall and tells her she’s not helping. Meanwhile, Nina texts Valentin and asks where he is. He responds, “The hospital.” Nina tells Nathan and Maxie they can talk about this later because she must leave.

Tracy realizes that Laura is right and GH is the sum of the people who work there. She apologizes for letting facts and figures get in the way, and thinks there is another solution. \nBack at GH, Valentin asks Finn and Griffin how Anna is. Finn tells him they found a blood clot and that’s all he can say. Finn tends to Anna and draws some blood, but his shaky hands cause him to drop the vial. Griffin sees this. Finn claims he’s just tired after a long shift. Later, Valentin sneaks in to see Anna while she sleeps. He speaks to her in Latin, and holds her hand. Nina arrives and is stunned to see her husband sitting by Anna’s side. At the nurse’s station, Griffin asks Finn what is going on with him. They are interrupted when the results of Anna’s bloodwork come in. Finn tells Griffin it’s not good news. Elsewhere, Franco arrives at work and runs into Hayden. He claims he’s here to help, and kisses up to her. Franco asks how they can stop the strike, but Hayden doesn’t know. She fears many will be fired, and let’s Franco know he that has been fired and his program cut. \nFranco tells Liz he has bad news. \nDillon tells Kiki, “It seems like it’s life or death.” \nMichael calls Jason to warn him that Tracy is up to something big. \nNed asks Olivia to spend the night. \nJulian tells Alexis, “You said you wanted an explanation.” \nNina asks Valentin what he’s doing with “that woman.” \nFinn asks for Anna’s permission to do a bone marrow biopsy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:15:10.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
