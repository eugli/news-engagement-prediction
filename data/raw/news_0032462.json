What transpired was anything but routine. \nThe Newcastle keeper really messed up his kick, only connecting with thin air, and it allowed Cameron Jerome in. \nThe Norwich striker chased down what seemed a loss cause and with the defender having turned his back expecting his goalie to kick the ball clear it was left for Jerome to run clear with an open net. \nThe former Premier League striker did his own impression of Ross Barkley by celebrating before the ball went in! \nDefeat would be a set-back in the Toon's chase for promotion back to the Premier League, but by no means fatal. \nHowever, we reckon the psychological scars Darlow has picked up tonight could last for quite a while. \nIs it the worst goalkeeping howler you've ever seen? \nThis story was first featured on talkingbaws.com - simple, shareable sport.
