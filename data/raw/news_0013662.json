The 1974 Johnny Cash recitation “Ragged Old Flag” played over images of American soldiers on the battlefield and modern-day military veterans returning from combat. \nAmong those featured in the film was Amitiyah Hyman, a pastor and actor who said she took part in Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic civil rights marches in Selma, Ala., and the 1963 March on Washington. Nate Boyer, a former member of the Army Special Forces, and Marines veteran Kirstie Ennis, who lost a leg in a helicopter accident, were also featured. \nThe nearly five-minute short was directed by Jennifer Pransky, a Fox Sports producer. The decision to carry the sport was credited to Fox Sports president Eric Shanks as a patriotic nod to “the things that matter to us,” Pransky said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:14:28.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
