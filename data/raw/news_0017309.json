ADVERTISEMENT \nAs of press time, the Quezon police have not responded to the Inquirer’s query on the incident. \n“The three men, wearing bonnets over their heads, sped off right after the incident,” Higala sa Lumad Network said, adding that Anglao died on the spot. \nAnglao was identified as a leader of Tindoga, an organization of Manobo-Pulangion which is very vocal against the expansion of plantations in Bukidnon.
