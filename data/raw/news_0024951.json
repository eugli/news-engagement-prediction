Temperatures are expected to plummet into the single digits, and wind gusts could reach 45 miles per hour.\nAdvertisement\nGovernor Charlie Baker said state offices will be closed on Thursday for non-emergency, executive branch employees.\nBecause of the timing of the storm, which will likely arrive before 7 a.m. and move out in the evening, public officials asked residents to avoid traveling if possible. “We’re asking folks to stay off the roads tomorrow and not travel unless absolutely necessary,” Baker said at a Wednesday evening press conference at the State House.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Baker also asked people to work from home if they can.\nView Story Baker urges residents to stay off roads Gov. Charlie Baker is asking residents to stay off the roads as a major winter storm is expected in Massachusetts Thursday.\n“The thing I want everybody to remember here is: You’re going to get up in the morning and it’s not going to look that bad,” Baker said. “But the heaviest snow is going to fall sometime between 10 o’clock in the morning and 4 o’clock in the afternoon.”\nBoston Public Schools canceled classes for Thursday, the first time that has happened this school year. And Mayor Martin J. Walsh announced that a citywide snow emergency would take effect at 10 a.m. — another first for the season.\nAdvertisement\nThe National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. Thursday for nearly all of Massachusetts. Cape Cod, the South Shore, and the Islands will be under a blizzard warning starting at 9 a.m.\nThe storm is likely to cause disruptions from Maryland to Maine, but weather service meteorologist Bill Simpson said southern New England is likely to bear the brunt.\nSo far the state has dodged major storms this winter. The one significant snowfall happened on a Saturday — dropping 8.1 inches in Boston and upwards of 15 inches to the southeast.\nSo far this winter, Boston has seen 16.8 inches of snow.\nRelated List of school closings ahead of Thursday’s snowstorm Here’s how tomorrow’s snow storm will develop Lately, February means lots of snow for Boston\nAndy Rosen can be reached at andrew.rosen@globe.com .
