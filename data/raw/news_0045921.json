However, prior to the auction, Alexander Historical Auctions set a final sale estimate of between $200,000 and $300,000. \nThe auction house described the phone as “Hitler’s mobile device of destruction.” \nA porcelain figure of an Alsatian dog, also owned by Hitler, was sold at the same auction but to a different bidder for $24,300.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:26:14.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
