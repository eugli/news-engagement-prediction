Sadly this heinous crime did not get the attention it deserved in media and only now the facts about the case is coming out after the intervention of social activists. 17 year old girl Nandhini, a daily wage laborer in Ariyalur district of Tamil Nadu was raped, murdered and thrown into a well by Manikandan and his group of friends. As her mother launched a complaint that he daughter was missing from December 26, 2016 the police found her body in the well. Nandhini belongs to the Dalit caste and the rapist-murderers belong to the dominant caste of that area. Activists fighting against caste discrimination against Dalits have taken the issue seriously and they have launched a campaign for 'Justice for Nandini'. The accused have been arrested under the Goonda's act. Ulaganayagan Kamal Haasan who rendered huge support for the youngsters protest of Jallikattu is the first person from Kollywood to raise his voice for Nandhini. On Friday he called for Justice for Nandhini and also apologized for delay in voicing his concern. Justice4Nandhini a must. Kaavi(saffron) khadigreenwhite red or black does'nt matter.
