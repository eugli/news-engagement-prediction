Having not raced in GT cars her name doesn’t appear on the FIA’s driver seeding list, and she has only raced in two VASC events previously. \nWhile she notched up podium and top-five finishes across the past five years in the IndyCar Series and FIA Formula E, her overall championship finishes are not enough to earn her any FIA Superlicence points. \nHowever, it is expected that an exemption will be forthcoming. \nFoxsports.com.au understands that De Silvestro will likely receive a dispensation from CAMS based on her international record, with cases such as De Silvestro’s the reason that the dispensation option exists. \nThe qualification criteria for a CAMS Superlicence has already caused controversy this year, with both of Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport’s intended drivers for 2017 applying for a dispensation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T10:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T06:08:29.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
