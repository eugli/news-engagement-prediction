Photograph: Anna Dubuis Supported by Thursday 2 February 2017 05.00 GMT Last modified on Thursday 2 February 2017 05.04 GMT \nAt a tailors’ workshop in Kibera, Nairobi’s sprawling slum, business has gone global for a group of women. \nAfter years spent sewing clothes for the local market, the 10 tailors have started on international orders for bow ties. \nTheir client is Wakuu, a two-year-old business employing Nairobi artisans to create suits and other garments using local fabric, kitenge, which they then sell in Europe and the US. \nThe women have been hired to create accessories and Wakuu says it will reinvest a portion of its profits into further training, as well as providing support to their families, for instance through improved childcare facilities. \n“Fashion can be a major growth driver for African nations,” says Daan Vreeburg, co-founder of Wakuu. “I saw we could build a business and employ people, give them a fair wage and break the poverty chain.” \nThe Kenyan garments sector remains relatively small, with just 40,000 workers according to a report (pdf) commissioned by development organisation Hivos. \nBut if the African Development Bank gets its way, this is set to change. In 2015 it launched the Fashionomics initiative, an online business platform designed to boost small businesses in the fashion and textile industry. The bank believes the sector could generate 400,000 jobs in sub-Saharan Africa by 2025. Can a hashtag change the fashion industry?

The textile industry is the second largest employer in developing countries , after agriculture, but the majority of artisans are trapped in domestic markets without links to international trade. \nWakuu is part of the steady flow of socially conscious fashion brands trying to challenge this norm by sourcing artisans from marginalised communities to produce their fashion lines. \nOthers include Artisan.Fashion, which connects Kenyan artisans to luxury brands such as Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney in a bid to pull high fashion houses away from mass production factories. \nThe company involves 22 community groups, recruited from existing networks like self-help and women’s groups, and is able to produce 100,000 units a year, mostly bags and accessories. \nNot all such enterprises succeed in scaling up and having a lasting impact, however. \nNew York brand SUNO, worn by the likes of Michelle Obama and Beyoncé, trained Kenyan tailors as part of efforts to build a sustainable fashion business. But last year it announced it would close after failing to attract sufficient investment to take it to the next stage. \nClare Lissaman, an ethical fashion consultant and co-founder of menswear brand Arthur & Henry, warns that good intentions do not always translate into sustainable businesses, and a robust business model is essential. \nBeing able to demonstrate the product’s worth is vital, she adds: “Just because it is made in the slums does not mean it is automatically good. You need to show you are doing what you say you are doing.” The search for profits \nVreeburg, who also works for the Netherlands-African Business Council, and his business partner Nick Searra, are conscious of the potential pitfalls as they attempt to scale up Wakuu.

The hope is this will ensure a sustainable market. \n“We are changing traditional designs a little bit but if we are to create opportunities in the western market it is important to create a product that we can sell,” says Jeff Parry, who is launching the brand this year with wife Anna. \nFrom their home in Sweden it is difficult to monitor working conditions so they have partnered with an existing Fairtrade-certified project employing women in the Maasai Mara. \n“For us it is obvious that they should be made fairly and ethically,” says Parry. “It’s really good for us to know the processes are right and that they get paid properly.” \nSign up to be a Guardian Sustainable Business member and get more stories like this direct to your inbox every week.
