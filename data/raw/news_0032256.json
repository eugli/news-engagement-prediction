Photo: New South Wales Police \n\"It's a photograph of someone who is broken right in that moment,\" says Philpott says. \"All dignity has been removed. The gaze haunts you.\" \nWell it might. That gaze belongs to a person in the throes of a sudden unravelling of an identity created more than 30 years prior, and steadfastly maintained in the face of considerable risk. Advertisement \nThe photograph was taken on July 5, 1920, after Harry Crawford, a general hand at the Empire Hotel in Annandale, had been brought into Sydney's Central Police Station for questioning. \nDetectives were keen to talk to Crawford. Three years earlier, the charred remains of a woman were found near a popular picnic spot at Lane Cove. \nAn open verdict was recorded by the coroner but then new information led investigators to a breakthrough identification: the body was likely that of Annie Birkett, who Crawford married in 1913 and who went missing in 1917. \nInterviewed just after Birkett's disappearance, Crawford claimed his wife had \"cleared out with a plumber\". Others, including Birkett's young son, suspected differently. \nDuring this second interview three years later, Crawford was asked to strip to show if he had any identifying marks or tattoos. He refused. Told he might go to jail, Crawford said, \"I want to go to the women's ward\". \nWhen asked why, he confessed his birth name was Eugenia Falleni and that he was a biological woman – a fact later confirmed by a police doctor. \nSo began one of the most sensational legal sagas in Australian history – the case of the \"man-woman\" Eugenia Falleni. \nIt remains no less fascinating to many today. Two books – Suzanne Falkiner's 1988 study Eugenia: A Man and Mark Tedeschi's Eugenia (2012) – have painstakingly raked over the story. The play Philpott wrote about Falleni, The Trouble with Harry , is about to get its Sydney premiere in the upcoming Mardi Gras festival. \nPhilpott says he was researching and writing his play at the same time Tedeschi, the Sydney barrister and QC, was compiling his account. The two works offer very different perspectives on Falleni's life and gender choices, says the playwright. \n\"Tedeschi frames his book as something historical and accurate but I feel it's more like a speculative fiction,\" Philpott says. \"I don't really agree with a lot of it. He's taken court transcriptions and documents and then draws conclusions about what was going on in various people's heads. We can't possibly know what they were thinking.\" \nPhilpott's main disagreement is with Tedeschi's argument that Birkett, previously married and widowed, had no knowledge that her husband was biologically a woman and that their lovemaking involved the covert use of a homemade dildo, an object dubbed \"the article\" in newspaper reports of the time. \n\"They lived together for seven years and Birkett wasn't aware of Falleni's biological gender? To me, that doesn't seem possible,\" Philpott says. \"In writing the play, I wanted to suggest to the audience that there are a number of possibilities to a story and we must always be aware that many of the stories we are told are told that way for a reason.\" \nIn The Trouble with Harry , Philpott deploys a chorus of two actors who disrupt and question the narrative as it unfolds. \"It's a way to remind the audience that what they are watching is a construction and that all the stories about this person are constructions.\" \nThe play also looks at the case through a set of lenses unavailable to people in the 1920s. \"This is a time when the word 'lesbian' wasn't in public discourse and the word 'transgender' wasn't even invented,\" Philpott says. \"How on earth could they tell the truth if they didn't even have the language to describe their relationship?\" \nThe Trouble with Harry purposely avoids trying to solve the mystery of Harry Crawford. It does pose a lot of questions, however: about how society treated and continues to treat those who fall outside of the heteronormative; about the ways in which class and ethnic prejudice corrupt justice and about the public and media's insatiable desire for the details of people's sexual lives. \n\"In the end, everyone is interested in what goes on in the bedroom,\" Philpott says. \"I think the curiosity about what Harry and Annie did under the sheets is the same faced by any relationship or family that isn't heteronormative. If you are outside the mainstream, you are under constant scrutiny which reinforces otherness. I don't think things have changed that much. It's a bit sad really.\" \nThe Trouble With Harry plays at the Seymour Centre from February 18.
