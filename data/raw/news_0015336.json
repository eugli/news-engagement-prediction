He said Pakistan supported China on all its core issues, while firmly opposing any attempt to undermine China’s sovereignty. \n“Pakistan will continue to support China’s efforts to combat the three evils of terrorism, extremism and separatism,” he said in a statement. \nAppreciating China’s forthright position on Pakistan’s counter-terrorism strategy and its successes, Mr. Fatemi thanked China for its support to national security and territorial integrity. \nThe talks take place days after Saeed was put under “house arrest” in Lahore by the Pakistan government after Punjab Province’s Interior Ministry issued an order in pursuance to a directive from the Federal Interior Ministry on January 27. \nDuring the talks, both sides noted that the all-weather friendship between the two countries has withstood the test of time, notwithstanding changes in the international, regional and domestic environments. \nEconomic corridor \nNoting the importance of CPEC for the economic development of Pakistan, the two sides stressed that timely completion of the $46-billion project would not only give a boost to Pakistan’s economy, but would also significantly contribute towards regional connectivity, peace and development. \nMr. Fatemi stated that Pakistan was fully committed to the timely and effective implementation of all the projects under CPEC. \nMr. Cheng said China attached great importance to its relations with Pakistan, and supports its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. He thanked Pakistan for its consistent support to China on issues of core interest and lauded Islamabad for its fight against terrorism, extremism and separatism. \nThe two sides expressed satisfaction at the continuing progress in bilateral relations in all fields and expressed their resolve to work towards further solidifying political relations, deepening economic bonds and security cooperation and closer people-to-people contacts to achieve the common goal of China-Pakistan “Community of Shared Destiny.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T19:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T14:51:49.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
