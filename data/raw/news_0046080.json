I will never heal.\" \nMs Smith said the saddest part was that her grandson Tim, born one day after the accident , would grow up without his father and with a mother who was too injured to care for him. \nNo date has been set for a final ruling in the inquest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:59:17.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
