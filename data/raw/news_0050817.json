Bhumi Pednekar and Akshay Kumar in the first look of Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. Twitter \nThe picture that he shared features him and his co-star Bhumi Pednekar as newlyweds. Pednekar sports a traditional red bridal attire adorened with golden embroidery. This reminds one of her last film, her debut film, Sharad Kataria's Dum Lagaa Ke Haisha . She played a small town newlywed in that romantic comedy as well. However, unlike that film, Pednekar sports a slimmer avatar and looks more at ease rather than a victim of an arranged marriage in that one. \nKumar looks rather erect which would indicate that he is not quite happy with the marriage. However, his content smile suggests otherwise. The costume designer seems to have worked more on Kumar's attire as his mustard suit is grabbing quite a few eyeballs on social media. \nIn fact, his Baby co-star Taapsee Pannu also complimented Kumar's choice of outfit, to which he retorted that they will get a similar one tailored for Pannu when she promotes her upcoming film, Shivam Nair's action thriller Naam Shabana , in which Kumar has done a cameo. \nHis mustard suit is complemented by the pale yellow walls and the garlands of yellow and orange flowers in the background. The way Kumar holds Pednekar speaks volumes of their equation. While the degree of discomfort seems quite low, there is a fine balance between a sense of entitlement and the will to give the other person their space.
