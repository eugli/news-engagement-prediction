(Photo: Matt Sayles, AP) 11 CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nA new convention created with the hopes of capitalizing on the popularity of true crime entertainment like Netflix's \"Making a Murderer\" and the podcast \"Serial\" has chosen Indianapolis for its first year. \nCrimeCon , scheduled for June 9-11 at the JW Marriott Indianapolis, will feature a number of prominent speakers in the field, including former HLN host Nancy Grace, crime show host Aphrodite Jones, renowned defense attorney F. Lee Bailey and Ken Kratz, the prosecutor involved in the \"Making a Murderer\" case, said Kevin Balfe, a partner at Red Seat Ventures, the agency producing the convention. \n\"People are fascinated by the stories that make up true crime,\" Balfe said, pointing to \"Cops\" as one of the longest-running TV shows in history. \"I think I was astounded to learn that this (convention) didn’t exist already.\" \nA convention exists for just about everything, he said, but not for those who enjoy learning about real-life crimes and all the players involved. \nCrimeCon will be in Indianapolis June 9-11 at the JW Marriott (Photo: CrimeCon) \n\"These are all incredible stories,\" he said. \"It's not reveling in the crime side; it's being fascinated by the characters and the emotion inside.\" \nCrimeCon entry is $299 per person and $519 VIP until Feb. 28 or $329 and $569 thereafter. All of the events will be in the JW, Balfe said, with a maximum capacity of 3,500 people. \nHe wouldn't disclose the number of registrations sold so far but called the attendees a \"really engaged audience\" of both crime professionals and fans of true crime. \n\"We have an audience that is a really insider audience,\" Balfe said. \"That’s been a genre that’s just taken off in the last 12 months. The beauty of the genre, unfortunately, is this stuff is going to continue to happen.\" \n[ Amy Bartner covers life in Downtown Indianapolis.

By its nature, CrimeCon will be a little bit on the darker side. \n\"This is not going to be a Comic Con with a ballroom filled with people dressed like serial killers,\" Balfe said. \nThe three-day schedule is made of sessions where the attendees are able to experience a first-person crime scene from the point of view of the forensic expert, the victim or the murderer, as well as informational sessions on cellphone tracking, jury selection and other topics. \nBalfe said Red Seat Ventures chose Indianapolis because of its location and history of hosting conventions and because CrimeCon wouldn't be an \"afterthought\" like it would be in larger cities. \n\"The city is manageable. It's a city that's hosted a Super Bowl,\" he said. \"There’s just something about Indy. It's a city to me that totally embraces things like this.\" \nNew York-based Red Seat Ventures is a digital marketing firm that has worked to promote brands and public figures such as Nancy Grace and \"Dirty Jobs\" host Mike Rowe. \nMany conventions choose Downtown Indianapolis for a first-year location based on the success of Gen Con, which has been in town since 2003 and now attracts more than 200,000 people and generates $74 million annually for the city. \n\"We're protective and proud of Gen Con, and we have long tracked other cons taking seeds here and growing based on Gen Con's success,\" said Chris Gahl, vice president of marketing for Visit Indy , the city's tourism organization. \"There'll be no reason to believe that (CrimeCon) wouldn't have success in year one like others.\" \nCall Amy Bartner at (317) 444-6752 and follow her on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram . <!--iframe--> Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/2liZ8ZO TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T16:40:33.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
