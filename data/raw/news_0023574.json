Story continues below \nThe $5.8 million retail alteration has been approved by the city and according to Kozak, it’s been years of discussion in the making. \n“We’ve been working on it for a couple of years so it’s nice to see the hoarding going up and the sound of construction in the background,” he said. \nReports among local sources said the retailer is major fashion house H&M but Kozak remained tight-lipped. \n“When we deal with these retailers, they make the choice to make the announcement themselves, so we’re going to wait it out and see what comes,” he said. \nFor the first time in eight years, sales at Cornwall have dropped slightly. \n“We’ve had a really good run over the past eight years with sales and traffic being up year over year. Last year was a little flat, maybe down a per cent,” Kozak said. \nHe chalks it up to strategically relocating shops and a soft market. \n“Strategically, we created some vacancies to allow us to relocate some tenants around the shopping centre so that we could make room to do this big retailer,” he said. \nThe new retailer is slated for an early 2018 opening. \nBig Brands in Regina \nThe secret retailer would join other major brands like Cabela’s and Designer Show Warehouse that have marked the Queen City as a place of interest. \nLisa Watson, associate professor of marketing at the University of Regina, said growth in Regina is steadily in line with other cities. \n“Everything we’ve seen here over the past few years is quite normal and it’s what we would expect around us. It’s growing and it’s great to see,” Watson said. \nWatson said the appeal is a combination of an untapped market and space opportunities. An example of that is Regina’s Grassland mall, she said. \n“When you have the whole Grasslands mall just opening up, it’s a wealth of opportunity. We saw lots of stores that we wouldn’t have otherwise expected,” Watson said. \nAn emailed statement from H&M Canada said the company had “nothing to confirm at this time.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:06:37.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
