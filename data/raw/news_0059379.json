Well basically it was just Shaq clowning JaVale because in between the occasional flash of brilliance, JaVale McGee would fuck up a billion times and he became the lead star of the Shaqtin’ A Fool bloopers. \nHowever this season has been JaVale’s rise to prominence. He’s cut down his SAF% (Shaqtin A Fool percentage which is good basketball highlights divided by highlights where you look like an asshole) while also leading the league in Plus/Minus per minute. Shaq is basically Billy Batts in Goodfellas and JaVale is Tommy DeVito. JaVale is sick of being told to get his shine box. \nWell last night Shaq took another shot at JaVale after the Warriors beat the Clippers. \nWhich woke up JaVale like The Undertaker rising for a casket, which led to a hell of a back and forth with The Diesel while most of the East coast was sleeping. \nSo where does this leave us? Basically at an good old fashioned stalemate. Shaq will never wave the white flag in a battle of shit talking because he’s always the loudest and biggest guy in the room. He’s like the kid in school that will keep talking until you punch him in the mouth, which probably isn’t out of the equation because I think JaVale is just crazy enough to do that if/when they cross paths. And if they rumble, I wouldn’t put it past Charles Barkley to sneak a few kicks into Shaq’s ribs if JaVale can knock him down. \nMeanwhile JaVale has the higher ground in this beef since he is younger, is currently more relevant since he plays on the best team in basketball, and not a mumbling asshole who ruins Inside The NBA. Plus while Shaq’s Twitter game can be lame (See: That bum Photoshop), JaVale’s Twitter game can be VICIOUS. Shaq came at JaVale with a Glass Joe jab last month. \nAnd JaVale hit him with a Little Mac star punch, except if it was delivered by Mike Tyson. \n(I don’t think I’m allowed to make any jokes about that one, but I will say that I will be using the peanut emoji when describing testicles a lot more, which is useful when tweeting about JaVale’s teammate Draymond Green.) \nh/t Nicky", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:23:14.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
