Their beef reportedly began after Soulja Boy showed a little social media appreciation for one of Brown’s exes, which was apparently beyond the pale for Brown. Their war of words eventually escalated to lawsuit threats and promises of a physical fight that would once and for all resolve Soulja’s alleged lack of deference shown to all people Brown has ever been in contact with. But according to Soulja Boy, Brown won’t sign the contract for the boxing match that had been deemed the only way to settle their dispute (and maybe make a little money along the way). Chris brown manager call my manager last night sand said the fight is off and he’s not signing contract.
