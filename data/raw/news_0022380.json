So it's a smaller, more portable, more affordable version of Echo, and it comes with full access to Alexa. Unlike the Echo, the Amazon Tap is wireless and must use the included cradle to charge. \nAmazon says it'll stream up to 9 hours of audio on a full charge, or last up to three weeks in standby mode. The Tap isn't an always-on by default. To wake it, you need to press the mic on the front. In February 2017, Amazon announced a new firmware update for Tap. With it, you can go to Settings in the Alexa app and enable the new Hands-free option in order to wake Alexa without having to tap the Tap \nHowever, the new hands-free mode will drain the battery quickly, as it requires the mic to stay always-on. Otherwise, Tap can do all the same tricks as Echo (so long as you're connected to Wi-Fi). Echo Dot \nRelease date: September 2016 Availability: Available in the US ( Amazon US order page ); available in the UK ( Amazon UK order page ) Price: $49 / Â£49 Dimensions: 38 mm x 84 mm x 84 mm Weight: 250 grams Connectivity: Bluetooth and dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi (MIMO) Power: Plugs into a wall outlet Audio: Voice-feedback only (Must be connected to external speakers) Alexa: Yes (Always-on/always-listening/voice-activated) \nEcho Dot is 1.6-inch-tall cylinder with one tiny speaker. It's basically just the top section of Amazon Echo - and half the price, but equally as smart. It supports always-on Alexa, connects to the cloud to stream music, controls your smarthome devices, and does all the same stuff as Echo. The original Echo Dot launched in the US in March 2016, but it was refreshed when Amazon announced its UK release. \nThe main difference between Dot and Echo is that the full-size speaker is gone. The idea is you'll hook Dot up to your own audio setup (via out jack or Bluetooth), so you can use Alexa with your existing speakers. That tiny speaker won't output much audio; it's only for Alexa voice feedback (which, again, requires Wi-Fi). \nThe new Echo Dot will be available to buy in a six-pack and 12-pack. For those opting for multiple Echo Dots around their home though, Amazon has introduced a feature that will mean only one Echo Dot, and the closest one, will respond to your request. Amazon Echo Dot review: The tiny personal assistant with big personality Conclusion \nAmazon Echo is ideal if you just want to have a stationary speaker that doubles as an always-on personal assistant. It'll provide you with room-filling audio that's sufficient for casual listening but it gets sort of tinny when turned up too much. If you're connected to Wi-Fi, you can ask it all sorts of questions and get it to control your stuff and it is available in the US and the UK. \nAmazon Tap is supposed to do all of that, including provide a similar sound experience, but it ditches the cord and uses a charging cradle in order to be portable. As it's not always plugged into power, always-on Alexa isn't available by default. You have to push a mic button to access the service or enable a new hands-free option. Tap is useful if you're going to the beach or are on the go, and it is only available in the US. \nAs for Dot, just think of it as a little, always-on Alexa hub. It's not a speaker but works with your speakers. It will be available in six and 12 packs so you can ensure every room in your home has Alexa listening.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:38:40.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
