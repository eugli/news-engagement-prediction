In his telephonic interview to CNN-News18, has also said that Jamaat-ud-Dawa has nothing to do with Lashkar. Masood made it clear through his interview that Hafiz Saeed his under House arrest (nazarband). He said, “we are living under oppression. Hafiz Saeed is under house arrest. The Pakistan Government has said that he will be kept under observation and if he does something illegal then action will be taken against him. While we have not done anything illegal, we run schools, dispensaries and are doing humanitarian work. We have nothing to do with Laskhar that is a Kashmiri unit. It is indigenous and it is working there. Should we be banned for this or given support?” \nListen to the interview here- #HafizTerrorTapes – Hafiz Saeed’s brother speaks to @manojkumargupta , curses Modi, blames India. But admits terror factory will keep working pic.twitter.com/EylQ164kte \n— News18 (@CNNnews18) February 20, 2017 \nWhen asked under whose pressure has Hafiz Saeed been banned, he blamed India and said that Pakistan Gave into India’s pressure. He told CNN-News18, “We think that it has been done under the pressure from India, They want to send a message to the world and the focus is shifted to Hafeez Saeed, Jama’at-ud-Da’wah to distract attention from the problems in Kashmir and India’s misdeeds are kept hidden. Indian wants to create a terrorism narrative. So, this is being done under India’s pressure and the Government of Pakistan has given in to the pressure. The truth is exactly the opposite.” \nWhen asked about whether the ban on Hafiz Saeed has affect the working of the agencies (JuD, FIF), he said, “even when the UN has put a sanction against us, our dispensaries were operating under the government. In Muridke (JuD/Jaish-e-Mohammed HQ) was working under the control of the Punjab Government. So, JuD has been under observation for long, we have idea what will be the next step. We have not been told of any restrictions on our activities and Saeed has been under house arrest to curb his support to the Kashmir issue. His house arrest has a direct link to the struggle in Kashmir.” Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T15:17:19.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
