BBC Suella Fernandes \nStuart joined forces with identity and integration think-tank British Future to lead an inquiry into the issue, which was launched in August 2016. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4 when the project was announced, Stuart said: “I think it would be good for the British government to take the initiative, say that we will protect EU citizens’ rights, and then expect the same for UK citizens in the rest of the EU to be similarly protected. \n“One of the duties of politicians is to be humane and when we deal with people’s lives, I think to show that we are open, we are a welcoming country, that we simply decided to leave a political institution called the European Union, that doesn’t mean we are ignoring people’s rights.” \nHer view did not change when the report was published in December, and in the foreword to the document Stuart wrote: “Defining the rights and status of these groups should be the first priority of this government in their negotiations with other EU member states. There are no domestic party political differences on this subject, as successive parliamentary debates have shown. \n“It would set the right tone in the subsequent negotiations if the UK reached out and confirmed the status and rights of EU citizens in the UK in a manner which gave a clear indication of how we would expect EU countries to respond to their UK citizens.” \nProfessor Peer told Commons People that he would not take part in any further work for the inquiry while Stuart and Fernandes were involved. \nHe said: “I sat on it in the assumption that they meant what they said, that all of us on the Remain or the Leave side could work together to agree on this one thing – which we all agreed was important, but then at the end of it, having signed up to it, they then vote against it and I don’t think you can trust someone once they’ve shown you that they can’t be trusted.” \nSuella Fernandes has yet to reply to requests for a comment.
