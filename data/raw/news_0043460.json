But our columnist said the cow with a beef who went on the lam should retain his status as protein, not hero. (Keith Craig Allen/Keith Craig Allen) The cow who escaped and fled a slaughterhouse was re-captured. His brief time on the lam doesn’t change one fact of life: He’s meat. (Debbie Egan-Chin/New York Daily News) \nNo disrespect to vegetarians, but let’s kill that cow right now, cook it up and eat it, preferably medium rare with a nice pepper sauce. \nOf course, I’m talking about the brazen bovine who went on the lam Thursday from Archer Halal Live Poultry, a Queens slaughterhouse. \nCOW WHO FLED QUEENS SLAUGHTERHOUSE IS SAVED BY ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVIST \nI certainly respect this animal’s beef with his captors, but his brief escape doesn’t change one fact of (his) life: He’s meat, he's no sacred cow. \nPredictably, the animal rights activists opened up their hearts to this four-stomached beast. One of them even convinced the owner of the slaughterhouse to free the creature so it could live out its days on the Skylands Animal Sanctuary in Jersey. Mmmm. Not eating this steak won't end animal suffering. (Rita Maas/Getty Images) \nCOW CAUGHT IN QUEENS AFTER IT'S SPOTTED RUNNING DOWN THE STREET \nNow the rest of the nation can get back to what it does best: murdering 35 million cows per year (on top of the 115 million pigs, 9 billion chickens and 270 million turkeys and tens of millions of other animals) for consumption on America’s smorgasbord. \nSure, let’s save one cow because he was lucky enough to slip out of his cage. But you’re deluding yourself if you think this rescue is going to change our national slogan from “Beef: It’s what’s for dinner” to “Mom, can you pass the kale salad?” \nEDITORIAL: DON'T HAVE A COW, OR DO \nSo until we have the much-needed full-on debate about the environmental, nutritional and agricultural disaster caused by our overconsumption of animal protein, the animal rights activists should do the only short-term good they can: they should buy the cow, have the good people of Archer Halal do their dirty work, and donate the meat to the poor, who deserve a break far more than this one animal. \nThe larger debate about animal abuse is a lot bigger than this one little cow.
