He’s taking care of it, he said. \nRight. \n“That’s a very good question,” he told me Monday, when I asked if, especially in the wake of Seth Williams’ financial mess, voters didn’t deserve some explanation for how he racked up his debts – and details, any details, please, \n“I’m not running from it,” \nSorry. I forgot. \nLast week, when my colleague Chris Brennan asked El-Shabazz about his financial troubles – $137,000 in unpaid federal taxes, $50,000 in defunct city taxes, and over a hundred thousand bucks in court judgments for unpaid rent – he answered again and again with this peach: He has a settlement, its up to date.

He grew angry. He wanted to know why he had to answer the same question over and over? \nAs if the answer to that question could not be more clear? \nThis is a race built on fallout from the financial problems that shredded the offices credibility. With due respect, you cannot start that campaign defending your own financial problems. You cannot start that race by ignoring questions that are fundamental to your credibility. \nA lot of is asked of the assistant district attorneys who fight it out in city courtrooms every day. They work now for a man who accepted gifts and cash and didn’t bother to tell anyone about it. El-Shabazz is asking them to now work for someone who hasn’t paid his bills and won \nThey deserve better. So do we. \nPeople get into financial trouble. It’s not a crime.
