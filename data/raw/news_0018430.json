How they decide to draw consumers further in is important, because it signifies where they’re choosing to focus those resources, and what they consider the viable social media strategies of the moment. This year, Marketing Land reports that hashtags were only included in 30 percent of Super Bowl ads, as opposed to 45 percent last year.\nThis year’s promotion tool of choice appears to be URLs, which were included in 41 percent of ads shown. It’s the first year, according to Marketing Land ’s research, that URLs have overtaken the hashtag. #rekt will hereby be known as rekt.com.\nIn their prime, hashtags were included in 57 percent of Super Bowl ads. This year’s selection included campaigns like #AvoSecrets, #TasteTheRainbow, and #TheSafeWordisUnlimited, which is so ridiculously long that it deserves to be the death of all hashtags.", "external_links": ["http://marketingland.com/hashtags-in-super-bowl-51-ads-205706"], "published": "2017-02-07T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T18:02:53.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
