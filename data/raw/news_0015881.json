The review board is expected to release a written decision in the coming days.\nA Crown attorney sided with de Delley, arguing in front of the board that an absolute discharge would pose too great of a risk to the public.\nBaker, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, was initially kept in a secure psychiatric facility in Selkirk, Man., but has gradually been granted more freedoms over the years.\nHe started living on his own last year, although a pharmacy employee continues to ensure that he takes his medications nightly, the review panel heard Monday.\nDr. Jeffrey Waldman, who has treated Baker, testified that although it took over a year for his “symptoms to be resolved completely” Baker is now a “low risk.\"\nDr. Waldman said that Baker understands his medication keeps his illness under control, although he admitted Baker could relapse if he is off medication for a prolonged period of time.\nHe recommended that Baker never stop seeing a psychiatrist.\nBaker plans to stay in Winnipeg for two to three years and wants visit his native China, according to Dr. Waldman.\nIn 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that people who’ve been found not criminally responsible for their crimes must be given an absolute discharge if they don’t pose a significant threat to public safety.\nToronto criminal lawyer Christopher Hicks told CTV News Channel that due to Baker’s “major mental illness,” he does not expect an absolute discharge. He thinks the review board will likely grant Baker more freedoms, but keep some conditions in place “to govern his behaviour and support him in the community.”\nDe Delley told CTV News Channel that her focus is not punishing Baker for her son’s death, but ensuring public safety and pushing for better mental health care services.\n“I don’t think punishment is the answer,” she said, adding that she is just “trying to take care” of her family and community by speaking out against Baker’s full release.\nMcLean was sitting next to Baker during the bus trip along the Trans-Canada Highway in July 2008 when Baker started stabbing him. Baker has said that he heard the voice of God telling him to kill McLean or \"die immediately.\"\nWith files from The Canadian Press and CTV's Jill Macyshon in Winnipeg \nRelated Stories Notable cases involving 'not criminally responsible' defence Man who beheaded Greyhound bus passenger seeking discharge: family High-profile cases in which individuals were ultimately released Man who beheaded fellow bus passenger wins right to live on his own", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:54:53.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
