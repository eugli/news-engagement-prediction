Among them have been rocket scientists such as Dr. Werner von Braun, astronaut John Glenn, and many others working in astronomy, astrophysics, climate science, and many branches of communications, propulsion, life support, and other technologies. Dr. Beth A. Brown was one of those people, an astrophysicist who dreamed of studying the stars from early childhood. Meet Beth Brown \nDr. Brown who worked at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, doing research into high-energy astrophysics. That's a branch of science that looks at very energetic things in the universe: supernova explosions, gamma-ray bursts, star birth, and the actions of black holes at the hearts of galaxies. She was originally from Roanoke, VA, where she grew up with her parents, younger brother, and older cousin. \ncontinue reading below our video 4 Tips for Improving Test Performance Beth liked science because she was always curious about how something worked and why something existed. She participated in science fairs in elementary school and junior high, but although space fascinated her, she chose projects that had nothing to do with astronomy. She grew up watching Star Trek , Star Wars , and other shows and movies about space. In fact, she often talked about how much Star Trek influenced her interest in space. \nDr. Brown attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., where she began studied physics and a little astronomy. Because of D.C.'s close proximity to NASA, Howard was able to do a couple of summer internships at the Goddard Space Flight Center, where she gained research experience. One of her professors made her research about what it takes to become an astronaut and what it is like to be in space. She discovered that her near-sighted vision would hurt her chances of being an astronaut, and that being in cramped quarters wasn't very appealing. \nShe graduated summa cum laude from Howard, receiving a BS in astrophysics in 1991, and remained there for another year in the physics graduate program. Although she had been more a physics major than an astronomy major, she decided to pursue astronomy as a career because it piqued her interest. \nShe next entered the doctoral program at the University of Michigan's Department of Astronomy. She taught several labs, co-created a short course on astronomy, spent time observing at the Kitt Peak National Observatory (in Arizona), presented at several conferences, and spent time working at a science museum that also had a planetarium. Dr. Brown received her MS in Astronomy in 1994, then went on to finish her thesis (on the subject of elliptical galaxies ). On December 20, 1998 she received her PhD., the first African-American woman to obtain a doctorate in astronomy from the department. \nDr. Brown returned to Goddard as a National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council post-doctoral research associate. In that position, she continued her thesis work on x-ray emission from galaxies. When that ended, she was hired directly by Goddard to work as an astrophysicist. Her main area of research was on the environment of elliptical galaxies, many of which shine brightly in the x-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum . This means there is very hot (about 10 million degrees) material in these galaxies. It could be energized by supernova explosions or possibly even the action of supermassive black holes. Dr. Brown used data from the ROSAT x -ray satellite and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory to trace activity in these objects. \nShe loved to do things involving educational outreach. One of her best-known outreach projects was the Multiwavelength Milky Way project â€” an effort to make data on our home galaxy accessible to educators, students, and the general public by showing it in as many wavelengths as possible. Her last posting at Goddard was as assistant director for science communications and higher education in the Science and Exploration Directorate at GSFC. \nDr. Brown worked at NASA until her death in 2008 and is remembered as one of the pioneering scientists in astrophysics at the agency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:11:11.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
