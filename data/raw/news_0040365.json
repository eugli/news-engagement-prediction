IKEA's Bedroom Sale Is Here For You Need a Refresh? IKEA's Bedroom Sale Is Here For You NORDLI storage bed, reg. $349, IKEA Family price $296.65 (Image credit: IKEA) \nFrom now until February 28, select bed frames and mattresses are on sale for 15% off, and several duvet sets are 25% off (what better way to get your hibernation on?). To access the sale prices, you have to be a member of IKEA's free loyalty program, IKEA Family . \nGreat news for those of us who could use more storage in the bedroom (um, basically everyone): Both NORDLI and MALM storage beds are 15% off—coming in at under $300 for the queen-sized models. \nNo matter whether you're pro-foam or spring's more your style, both types of mattresses are on sale— MORGEDAL and MYRBACKA for foam fans, HESSTUN and HAUGESUND for spring. Bonus: If you decide to snag a new mattress and get it delivered, IKEA will get rid of your old one for you —no awkwardly sliding it down the stairs yourself. STRANDKRYPA Duvet cover and pillowcases, reg. $29.99, IKEA Family price $22.49 (Image credit: IKEA) \nSure, you could DIY your own duvet , but when there are a range of options for under $30, then you could save yourself some time instead. Our picks? We love the botanical STRANDKRYPA, the classic striped NYPONROS , the toile-esque ALVINE KVIST , and the bold and colorful BOLLTISTEL . \nThe online flyer for the sale also mentions new lower prices for items like duvets , throw blankets , and RIBBA frames (if you choose to stock up, we have some ideas on how to use them all around the house). \nIf you plan on heading to your nearest store today, February 18 through Monday, February 20, IKEA Family members eat free (yes, FREE) with a day-of store receipt for $100 or more, pre-tax.
