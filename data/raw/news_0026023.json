She said she even attracted hateful comments last summer when she was in great shape and won the Miss Universe Canada pageant, right after running her first marathon. \n“I was fit. I was active and even then people were calling me fat, overweight, lazy,” Bearchell recalled. “So when I got to Miss Universe, those comments only escalated.” \nBearchell said she had enough when she noticed young women online expressing concern about their own looks after she was targeted. \n“I had to say something for the girls who follow me and who maybe see me as an inspiration,” Bearchell said. “Our young women need a voice because we live in a society that profits off of our insecurities.” \nLast week, Bearchell posted a photo of herself at the Miss Universe competition beside another image had doctored to make her appear heavier with a lengthy message to her followers. \n“We need to uplift the women in our lives rather than belittle them for their appearance,” she wrote. “We need to celebrate the diversity and uniqueness that we all exhibit. There is beauty beyond size. There is beauty beyond walking on stage in a bikini. There is beauty beyond looking a particular way.” \nIn another post , Bearchell questioned why critics believe it’s okay to belittle a stranger online when they wouldn’t treat their family and friends in the same manner. \n“When we think about the people we love, we think about their character, their humour, their intelligence, their wit, their generosity, their kindness and humility,” Bearchell said. “We don't define our friends and family solely on their appearance.” \nBearchell said the response to her comments has been “incredible” and that she has received emails and messages every single day from women around the world thanking her for her words. \n“[They] tell me that I’ve helped them change how they view themselves, I have changed their lives because they can now find beauty within themselves,” she said. \nThe determined young woman said the online trolls still write mean comments about her, but now that she’s changed her outlook, they don’t bother her as much as before. \n“If anything, it adds fuel to my fire to keep speaking on behalf of young women who maybe don’t necessarily have a voice,” Bearchell said. “If this kind of stuff is still going on, there are still things that need to be said.” A photo posted by Siera Bearchell (@sierabearchell) on Feb 2, 2017 at 6:23am PST A photo posted by Siera Bearchell (@sierabearchell) on Feb 3, 2017 at 6:54am PST A photo posted by Siera Bearchell (@sierabearchell) on Feb 4, 2017 at 11:16am PST A photo posted by Siera Bearchell (@sierabearchell) on Jan 26, 2017 at 1:23am PST A photo posted by Siera Bearchell (@sierabearchell) on Jan 17, 2017 at 10:26am PST Related Stories Miss France crowned new Miss Universe Photos Miss Universe Canada is trying to promote self-love after she received criticisms about her appearance from body shamers online.
