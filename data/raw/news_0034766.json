He said yes and when I asked why, he told me that it was policy that men cannot come into the pub in a dress.\" \nMr Murphy was told the manager was \"too busy\" to see him. \nThey had rocked up at the pub chain on Deansgate, in Manchester, at around 7pm for their Saturday night out. \nMr Murphy has confidence in his daring dress sense and wears high heels to work everyday. \nHe added: “When it was clear he wasn’t going to let us in at the Slug and Lettuce, we left there and went just along Deansgate to The Living Room, where they were fine with what I was wearing. \n“I wasn’t dressed like a tramp, I wasn’t that extreme, and I wasn’t in a joke outfit - on a weekend and nights out in Manchester this is how I would normally dress.” \nMEN CLASS: The pair had been at auditions for the new series of Big Brother \nThe pub chain offered the reveller a bottle of prosecco on his next visit. \nA spokeswoman said: “The management team were not aware of Mr Murphy’s entry refusal until after the event. \n\"This does not reflect our company policy and the doorman in question is no longer employed at the venue. We have apologised personally for any offence caused.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:46:30.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
