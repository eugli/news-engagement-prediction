There are nextgen persons, too, like Jaya Anand from Divakaran's family and Vivek from Ilavarasi's family who don't face any cases. \n\nSasikala's tryst with judicial proceedings started with that of Jayalalithaa, in 1996. Jayalalithaa suffered four convictions but wriggled out of all cases but one — the Rs 66.65 crore disproportionate assets case. \n\nExcept the Pleasant Stay Hotels case, Sasikala was convicted in all other three cases along with Jayalalithaa. And the biggest test of all is the disproportionate assets case, the verdict of which has been pending before the Supreme Court since June 7, 2016. It will be out any time now, at least not later than May 2017, as one of the two judges is scheduled to retire by then. \n\nLast week, Madras high court set aside Sasikala's discharge in at least four Enforcement Directorate-investigated cases, thereby exposing her to trial in all these cases. There is already an appeal by the ED pending in the Supreme Court relating to her non-appearance of ED summons in a FERA violations case. Her husband is still battling two cases relating to import of a Lexus car nearly 20 years ago. \n\nSasikalaa's nephew Dinakaran is facing the ED fine of Rs 28 crore imposed on him for FERA violations, which has now been confirmed by Madras HC. Last week the high court revived two more ED-probed JJTV transponder/uplinking fee cases against the former MP. \n\nVN Sudhagaran and J Ilavarasi are coaccused in the Rs 66.65-crore disproportionate assets case. Divakaran is facing at least two land grab cases, both registered by the Jayalaltihaa government in 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:14:28.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
