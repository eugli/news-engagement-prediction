LIVING IN FANTASY LAND: How Helen Bailey's deceitful IT expert fiance tried to pin her death on two blokes called 'Nick and Joe' before his web of lies slowly unravelled to reveal sinister truth \nIan Stewart faces a lifetime behind bars for the murder of Helen Bailey. But protesting his innocence til the very end, Stewart had to come up with a plausible explanation for why his fiancee's body was found underneath their Royston home, three months after he reported her missing. Sitting in jail, awaiting his trial, Stewart knew he had to think of an excuse. So, five months after she disappeared, he told this story to police: Ian Stewart told police that Helen Bailey had been kidnapped by former business associates of her dead husband, John Sinfield. Identifying the men only as \"Joe\" and \"Nick\", he said that the pair had called around to the Royston home in February 2016, demanding to speak to Helen about some paperwork. It was during one of their mysterious visits that the men saw the cesspit, being inspected by Helen and Stewart, with Nick, described as a big man with tattoos on his neck, even helping to slide the manhole cover back into place. The men visited the home again, with Stewart claiming Helen said: \"Please go away and leave me alone\" with Joe simply whispering back \"Just think about it\". Later that day, Helen disappeared and Stewart was confronted by the thug Nick, who punched him in the stomach. Painting himself as the victim, Stewart said he ended up on the floor and was told: \"Helen and Boris are with us. She is helping us solve a problem. Don't tell anyone where Helen is.\" It wasn't until Friday that he heard from Helen, with Nick handing him a phone with Helen on the other end. Stewart said: \"She said 'I love you, sorry about everything.' I said 'It's not your fault, I love you too'.\" Months later, in June, the pair visited again, forcing him to let them drive their car into their home. It was then, Stewart claimed, they must have stashed Helen's body in the cesspit without him knowing. In June of last year Stewart claimed he was told by the kidnappers he would have to come up with half-a-million pounds in \"compensation.\" Stewart claimed he hadn't told the police about the kidnapping for fear that harm would come to Helen and his sons. Even on remand in Bedford Prison, Stewart claimed the kidnappers managed to warn him against talking to the police. He said he was attacked by another inmate who told him \"Don't snitch.\" It was since revealed in court that there were, in fact, two men who resembled the mysterious abductors. Joe Cippullo and Nick Cook were men known to him from when he lived in Bassingbourne. Joe Cippullo went bowling with him and Nick Cook was his former next door neighbour. The real life Nick and Joe were presented to the jury while Stewart was being cross-examined. \" You recognise them, do you, Mr Stewart?\" asked Mr Trimmer. \"Yes, it's Nick and Joe,\" he replied. \nJohn Bailey, Helen's brother, revealed the true cost of the final judgment, saying: \"Despite this victory for justice, there can be no celebration. \n\"Our families have been devastated and nothing can ever bring Helen back to us, or truly right this wrong. \n\"A long shadow of loss has been cast over the lives of so many who will always remember Helen with enduring love and affection.\" \nWe pay for your stories!
