Mrs Howarth was burned on her face.”\nThe attackers forced the couple into their pickup truck before driving them away from the farm.\nMr Lynn was shot in the neck and dumped in the bush with a black plastic bag tied over his head.\nWhen the attackers drove off, he stumbled towards the road between the small towns of between Belfast and Stoffberg, where he found Mrs Howarth, unconscious with a bag shoved down her throat.\nSue Howarth was well known at sheepdog trials in the area Credit: Enterprise News and Pictures A passerby found the couple and stopped to help.
