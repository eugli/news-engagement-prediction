I condemn this disgusting act!”\nThe glass on the front door of the Centre Khadijah mosque on Centre St. was shattered and eggs were thrown at the building.\nIt happened in the morning, as members of the mosque attended a funeral at the Maurice Richard Arena for three of the six men murdered in Quebec City.\n“This is very sad day in our community. We just came from the Maurice Richard Arena. As soon as we came back here we saw this. It happened this morning, but I didn’t see it this morning. Police informed me,” said Fazle Elahi Ashek Ahman of the Khadijah Centre.\n\n\n\n(photo: CTV Montreal / Aalia Adam) \n\nThe incident comes as Montreal police report hate crimes have spiked in the days since the Quebec City mosque attack.\nMembers of the mosque said the incident has left them rattled, and that they felt very integrated in the community.\nThe mosque also serves as a food bank and holds fundraisers for not just the Muslim community, but the local community at large, said members.\n\"Vandalism at the Khadijah Mosque in my riding is an unacceptable gesture that I strongly condemn,\" said Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne MNA Dominique Anglade in a tweet. \nThey said the hateful incident is very disappointing, adding that they don’t feel safe and that members will have to be more cautious as they come to the mosque five times a day for their prayers.\nThere are surveillance cameras installed at the mosque, and members hope they will catch the perpetrator. A police investigation is ongoing.\nThe building was also spray-painted with graffiti a few months ago.\n \nRelated Stories Hate crime reports spike since mosque shooting Mourners gather in Montreal for victims of terrorist attack", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:13:02.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
