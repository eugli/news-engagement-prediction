Winnipeg’s Muslim community said the tragedy has shaken everyone. \nRELATED: Quebec City mosque shooting: Alexandre Bissonnette charged with 6 counts of 1st degree murder \n“Every single part of your body’s in pain. Definitely your whole body,” Muhummad Fiesel Khan said. \nKhan moved to Canada in 2011, and said he can’t believe how friendly Winnipeggers are, and how many people came out to pay tribute after a tragic event. \n“That makes you proud, and that makes you more comfortable. That tells you there will be no hate for sure.” \nThe Grand Mosque on Waverley Street was packed with people of all ages and different backgrounds, joining in a prayer for the deceased. \n“Manitoba really does emphasizes the license plates of that it says, friendly Manitoba, and we still see it all the time,” President of Manitoba Islamic Association Osaed Khan said. \nA similar crowd was drawn to the steps of the Legislature earlier in the night. Speeches and stories were shared in front of a large group, who said they just wanted to talk about what happened.

It’s good to get off the internet and start having real conversations,” Erica Johnson said, who decided to attend the vigil when it was announced. \nThe out pour of support has meant a lot to the Muslim community, according to Osaed Khan. He said Winnipeggers came together, to help when it was needed most. \n“The Muslim Community was in a state of shock when this happened. They were worried ‘how do out neighbours feel about us’. But when you see this out pour, it’s very nice. Nice to be a Canadian.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:01:45.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
