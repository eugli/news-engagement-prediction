But President Trump’s travel ban, which is currently on hold because of a temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Court Judge James Robert in Seattle, has already impacted attendance at this year’s Oscars. In a statement issued Jan. 29, Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, whose film The Salesman is nominated for best foreign-language film, said he will not attend the awards because of the executive order which he condemned as “unjust.” \nWhile Boone Isaacs did not mention Trump by name, she said, “Art has no borders,” continuing, “Strong societies don’t censor art, they celebrate it,” and adding, “Borders cannot be allow to stop any of us,” drawing a big round of applause. \nIn her opening remarks, the Academy president also acknowledged the efforts the Academy has made in the name of diversity and inclusion. “Wow, what a difference a year makes,” she said, to further applause, a reference to the fact that this year there are many more nominees of color, particularly in the acting categories, which had been branded #OscarsSoWhite during the past two years. \n“Real progress has been made — progress that I am confident will continue in the future,” she said. “When we reach out to be inclusive, we set an important example,” she contended, saying, \"We become agents of change.\" Scott Feinberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:04:36.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
