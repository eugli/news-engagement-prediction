The restaurant’s $10 million, 2,120-square-foot kitchen re-do was officially christened during dinner service on Saturday. Designed by Norwegian architecture firm Snøhetta, fresh off their grand SFMOMA redesign, the kitchen project included new office space, 9,000 square-feet of landscape design and a (presumably very secure ) 16,000-bottle wine cellar. On a practical level, Keller’s culinary olympians got a new kitchen designed for efficiency, the Chronicle reports . Everything from the height of the counters to the acoustics, was carefully considered and the ceiling is meant to evoke undulating white tablecloths. A row of windows between the dining room and the new kitchen offers a peek behind the scenes and, of course, Keller made sure to include those five, iconic brass stars looming over the pass.
