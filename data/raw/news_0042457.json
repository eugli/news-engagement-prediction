Close Fundraising campaign for sick girl stopped by government UP NEXT \nIsobel Lister, who is nine years old, was born prematurely at 31 weeks with Tracheoesophageal Fistula and required her first surgery when she was just twelve hours old. \nAt eight months she was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. \nWhen she was three, Isobel was still unable to crawl, sit or walk and only said a couple of words. \nHowever with the help of previous fundraising efforts, she was able to undergo stem cell treatment in Germany which made a significant improvement. Source: http://www.friendsofisobel.com.au \nThe Friends of Isobel website states: \"She is able to walk short distances assisted by her walker and her speech has also made a mind-blowing improvement.\" \nThe next objective for the family is to travel to St Louis in the US for Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy, in the hope that one day Isobel will be able to walk unaided without her walker. \nHowever, for that to happen the family must raise $140,000. Source: http://www.friendsofisobel.com.au \nA friend of the family Christina Thomas had been raising money through their carpet cleaning business. \n\"We decided that we would donate from our business $2 from every job that we do,\" Ms Thomas said. \nMs Thomas said she didn't increase her prices, instead taking the money out of her company's income. \nHowever Western Australian charity licensing restrictions have meant the business have found it difficult to donate the funds raised. \nLanie Chopping from Consumer Protection WA said: \"If you want to collect money for a charitable purpose you either need to have a license yourself, or you need to do so under the auspice of a licensed charity. \n\"Now that's not because of bureaucracy, that's because if a licensed charity collects money they will need to provide financial records to the department.\" Source: http://www.friendsofisobel.com.au \nMs Chopping says people who fund raise without a license are liable for prosecution. \n\"What we will do is link that person up with a licensed charity and those licensed charities will agree to take the money and then make sure that it goes to the charitable purpose for which it was collected,\" Ms Chopping said. \nChristina Thomas said: \"It kind of seems like we're not allowed to do what we want with our own money.\" \nThe Lister family is still determined to give their daughter every chance to reach her full potential. \nAnyone who wishes to donate can head to the Friends of Isobel website .
