So to pay tribute to the late pop icon, Coldplay 's Chris Martin honored George with a gorgeous tribute at this year's BRIT Awards. \nChris graced The O2 Arena in London to perform a beautiful cover of George Michael's 1986 song \"A Different Corner.\" This wasn't any ordinary cover -- at one point during the performance, the screen behind Chris was filled with an image of George as he sang his own song, in a sort of virtual duet.   44680, \"name\" : \"George Michael\" } } \nGeorge Michael's WHAM! bandmate Andrew Ridgeley appeared on stage, along with the backup singers Pepsi & Shirlie, before Chris performed his tribute. Andrew told the crowd of George, \"On Christmas Day 2016, the greatest singer-songwriter of his generation, an icon of his era, and my beloved friend, George Michael, was lost.\" He continued, \"A supernova in a firmament of shining stars had been extinguished, and it felt like the sky had fallen in. It started out ordinarily enough: In 1975, we were two boys that happened to share a mutual sense of humor, a love of life-affirming music, the records and artists it gave birth to, and a shared sense that we understood it.\" \nThis isn't the first time that Chris has paid tribute to George Michael either. A few days after Christmas (two days after George passed away), Chris visited a homeless shelter in London where he performed for a group there. He sang Wham! 's hit single \"Last Christmas\" to honor the recording artist. \nGeorge Michael passed away at his home in England on Christmas Day (2016) at 53 years old.
