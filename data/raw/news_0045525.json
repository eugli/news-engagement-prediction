He pitched the first game of an NL Division Series against Atlanta and became the first major leaguer with five wild pitches in one inning.\nHe said he was \"scared to death\" before his first start the next season against Randy Johnson and the Arizona Diamondbacks and turned to alcohol to suppress his nerves.\n\"I know I have no chance,\" he said. \"Feeling the pressure of all that, right before the game, I get a bottle of vodka. I just started drinking vodka. Lo and behold, it kind of tamed the monster, and I was able to do what I wanted.\"\nAnkiel pitched five innings and got the win against Arizona.\nRick Ankiel celebrates after crossing home plate on his solo, game-winning home run in the top of the 11th inning in Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the San Francisco Giants Friday, Oct. 8, 2010. Carlos Avila Gonzalez/San Francisco Chronicle \"I'm sitting on the bench feeling crazy, I have to drink vodka to pitch through this,\" he added. \"It worked for that game. I had never drank before a game before. It was one of those things like the yips, the monster, the disease ... it didn't fight fair, so I felt like I wasn't going to fight fair either.\"\nAnkiel drank again before his next start against Houston. This time, \"anxiety took over the alcohol,\" and he walked five, hit a batter and threw a wild pitch. He said he didn't drink before games after that.\nAnkiel has co-written a book, \"The Phenomenon: Pressure, the Yips and the Pitch that Changed My Life,\" with Tim Brown, which is set for release April 18.\nThe left-hander finished second in rookie of the year voting in 2000 before falling apart in the playoffs. After his lousy start against the Braves, he made two more appearances that postseason, walking five and throwing four more wild pitches over 1-1/3 innings.\nAnkiel never regained his form and made his final pitching appearance in 2004. He returned to the Cardinals in 2007 as an outfielder and played in the majors until 2013, including one season with the Braves.\n\"I think the overall lesson from the book is about getting back up,\" Ankiel said. \"You're going to get knocked down ... everyone gets knocked down.\"\nSuggested video:", "external_links": ["http://insidestl.com/?powerpress_pinw=1989507-podcast"], "published": "2017-02-21T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:10:52.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
