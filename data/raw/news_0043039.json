If the same sobriquet were applied to Mongolia, however, it would simply be inadequate. For this enormous landlocked country of green steppe, vast flat plains, intricately braided rivers, electric-blue highland lakes, snow-licked mountains, dense pine forests and shifting desert is presided over by a skyscape of such bold blue immensity it beggars description. \nIt’s not just vast; Mongolia is empty, too. Three times bigger than France, its population is less than a 20th of the UK’s – and one in three people live in the nation’s sole city, the capital Ulaan Baatar. Mongolia is empty. Three times bigger than France, its population is less than a 20th of the UK’s \nIt is also, even a quarter of a century after freeing itself from the shackles of Moscow, very little visited – something that is beginning to change, following the opening of two new luxury hotels in Ulaan Baatar and the scheduled opening this year of a new international airport. Mapped: The world's most (and least) crowded countries \nI decided to get in ahead of the crowds by taking a journey by 4x4 through this incredible land, so sparse in terms of people but, with more than three million horses, 28 million sheep, as many goats, nearly four million cattle and 200,000 Bactrian camels, so rich in terms of livestock.

I was invited into my first ger (the conical felt tents that still house almost 50 per cent of Mongolia’s inhabitants) a couple of days into my trip, heading south on dirt roads from the tiny settlement of Murun, in the north. Sitting on low couches, my guide Duggi, driver Tziggi and myself slurped on the bowls of warm, salted butter tea proffered by our host . Top 10 | The least crowded destinations on Earth \nI gazed around the ger with interest. Like all the best homes, the focal point was the fireplace, in this case a smoke-blackened iron stove. Above the wood-burner hung a line of ragged strips of beef being air-cured for jerky, while slices of curd dangled from strings above the door. Large aluminium trays contained yogurt and cheese, another yellow cream so thick our host sliced it with a knife before handing us a portion to try (it was delicious!). Meat and dairy produce form the average Mongolian’s staple diet; fruit and vegetables are a rarity. With the nearest shop a day and half’s journey away, these nomadic families rely on what they can produce themselves. \nUnder flawlessly blue late-August skies, the temperatures a beatific 20C or so, and our host’s young daughter doing cartwheels, it was hard not to be enraptured. Especially as the valley below the ger was threaded by a tumbling brook and pine-carpeted peaks swept up all around. But it’s a harsh life, and that wood-burner would be needed, as the first snows usually fall in September, and midwinter temperatures drop to -40C. 17 unusual destinations where the terror threat is low \nThe nomadic pastoralist way of life, still practised by almost 30 per cent of the population, forms a fascinating backdrop of any trip to Mongolia. From the lakes, mountains and forests of the north through the vast steppe-lands of the centre to the deserts of the Gobi in the south, you never seem to be very far from a ger camp. \nBut there are some settlements too. Jargalan is an isolated example made up entirely of pine-built, pitched-roofed houses, each with its own fenced yard. There’s something of the Wild West about it. Rolling through town on the rutted dirt road, it’s easy to imagine yourself a settler heading west through a frontier township – especially when the local population look similar to many Native Americans (understandably, given that indigenous Americans originated in the area where modern Russia, Mongolia, China and Kazakhstan intersect). \nRather bigger is the provincial town of Kharkhorin. This is the historical centre of the country. Here Genghis Khan (more properly Chinggis Khan) built Karakorum, the capital city of an empire which, in its 13th-century heyday, stretched from the Sea of Japan to Central Europe. Chinggis was hardly a pacifist, but his reputation for brutality is leavened by the fact that his capital was home to places of worship for Buddhists, Christians and Muslims. He remains a source of pride for all Mongolians, and statues of him dot the country. The largest, close to Ulaan Baatar, a 40m high behemoth, has earned a place in the Guinness Book of Records.

There are plenty of other historical sites around Kharkhorin – indeed the whole region has been designated the Orkhon Valley Cultural Landscape, a Unesco World Heritage Site. I visited the atmospheric remains of several cities left by successive empires in the region – the Göktürk, Uighur and Qitan – all of whom preceded the Mongol Empire. Today’s Turks, whose ancestors migrated westwards from here between the sixth and 10th centuries, revere this region, as a couple of stelae found here, today housed in a museum above the valley, are inscribed with the first Turkic language texts. Far older than the Turkic stelae are deer stones – Bronze Age megaliths carved with beautifully stylised deer and other motifs, standing between three and 15 feet high. I visited several deer stone sites, including one near Murun, and another north of Kharkhorin. Experts are divided on their purpose, but for the modern traveller these mysterious granite standing stones make a fantastic foreground for photographs of the boundless steppe on which they have been erected. \nKharkhorin was also the starting point of my trip to Tovkhon Monastery, reached after an incredibly scenic three-hour drive up the upper reaches of the Orkhon river, and evocatively set on a limestone outcrop peeping out above a sea of pine trees. This was once the home of the 17th-century Buddhist monk Zanabazar, one of those who faith brought north from Tibet. He was a sculptor sometimes dubbed the “Michelangelo of Asia” whose exquisite statues of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas are the centrepieces of Ulaan Baatar’s excellent Zanabazar Museum of Fine Arts. But many were produced in this remote monastery. Today it’s a lovely spot, with nearby trees bedecked with lines of fluttering blue prayer flags, the entire forest ringing with bird song.

I saw buzzards, eagles, hawks and falcons, steppe vultures, alpine chough, crane, ruddy shelduck, wheatears and many more. Wildlife, vast herds of feral horses apart, was harder to spot. But one dusk, in the Hustai National Park, I was delighted to see marmots galore, a ridge outlined with the distinctive silhouettes of three red deer stags, and a herd of stocky Przewalski’s horses. The latter, reintroduced into its native environment after being made extinct in the wild, is the world’s only true wild horse. \nTowards the end of my trip, in true tourist fashion I took a short camel ride (and having now experienced both, I can assure you that Mongolia’s twin-humped Bactrian camels are far more comfortable and secure than single-humped dromedaries), and enjoyed a delightful walk up the Yolyn Am gorge, watching yellow wagtails flit alongside a burbling brook and lammergeiers wheel overhead. I also saw what I am sure was a gerbil, and more certainly identified another very cute rodent, the pika, numbers of which scurried and whistled warnings among the undergrowth.

When I was growing-up in 1970s Britain, Mongolia was byword for remoteness. It was the kind of place you almost certainly wouldn’t be able to locate on a map, let alone get to – it was then a Soviet satellite state. Yet on my visit to the country I had shared a flight with a group of ladies from the British Horse Society setting out on an equine adventure, met a bunch of middle-aged Frenchmen riding Indian-built Royal Enfield motorcycles, bumped into a Dutch father and daughter on a cycling jaunt, and conversed with a posse of burly American anglers on a wilderness fly-fishing trip in pursuit of the legendary taimen. \nMongolia may still feel remote compared with many countries, but with the new hotels and airport it is opening up to tourism. The rewards for those who make the effort to get to this stunningly beautiful, unspoilt country are, like its sky, immense.
