(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images) NEW   1:17 AM \nPresident Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court expressed disdain for apartheid protesters in a series of columns published by a Columbia University newspaper — and one time had retract a fabricated story about a student activist, the Daily News has learned. \nNeil Gorsuch, who was nominated by Trump on Tuesday night , graduated from the Ivy League school with honors in 1988. While enrolled, Gorsuch penned columns for the Columbia Daily Spectator about what he perceived as a liberal bias plaguing the student body. \nIn one column, Gorsuch blasted student “coalitions” and “committees” protesting American companies profiting off of the segregationist Apartheid regime in South Africa. \nThe young Gorsuch questioned why students would oppose such investments since it paid “for our need-blind admissions policy.” He also wondered why \"gentrification\" got such a bad rap in New York City. \n“Is it because such arguments would be Immoral, False and Heartless? Or is it because it is not fashionable at Columbia to be anything other than a pro-Sandinista, anti-Reagan, ADHOC, uranium-pilfering protester?” he wrote. Gorsuch penned columns blasting liberal bias while attending Columbia University in the 1980s. (Shawn Inglima/for New York Daily News) \nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment. \nBut Jordan Kushner, a Minnesota resident who attended Columbia with Gorsuch, told The News that the potential Supreme Court justice could be bad for the country. \n“Our civil liberties are at danger, and someone of the conservative caliber of Gorsuch certainly increases that danger,” Kushner, 51, said. “I think it’s disturbing but I can’t see Trump appointing anyone who’s better than him. We got what we expected from a Trump appointee.” \nA look at Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch \nKushner, a civil rights attorney residing in Minneapolis, recalled protesting the Coors Beer Company at a student grocery store while attending Columbia. A large group of students were lamenting the beverage giant for supposedly violating workers’ civil rights while allocating profits to organizations promoting racism and homophobia, Kushner said. Protesters blocked traffic in front of Trump Tower during a protest against Trump nominating Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. (STEPHANIE KEITH/REUTERS) \nGorsuch wrote an article about the protest for the conservative-leaning Federalist newspaper that falsely claimed Kushner damaged property at the grocery store. \n“He said I started kicking beer kegs and acting crazy, even though that wasn’t true so he had to do a retraction,” Kushner said, describing himself as being a leftist political activist at the time. “He had that biting thing against me…He did not like protesters.” \nIn other columns, Gorsuch praised far right guerilla groups in Afghanistan as “freedom fighters,” while lauding President Ronald Reagan for secretly funding the right-wing Contras group in Nicaragua despite Congress prohibiting such a move.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T13:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T08:33:13.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
