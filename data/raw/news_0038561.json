( goo.gl/oXQSxV ) \n\"Conatel ordered as a precautionary measure the suspension ... of all CNN en Espanol transmissions in the national territory.\" \nForeign minister Delcy Rodriguez also lambasted CNN on Wednesday, saying the whistleblower in the passports' story was an opposition-linked Venezuelan working for \"imperialist\" intelligence agencies. \n\"Today the government of Venezuela pulled our television signal, denying Venezuelans news and information from our television network, which they have relied upon for 20 years,\" said a CNN statement, adding that its signal would be available for free on YouTube. \nThe spat with the network has come at a delicate time in U.S.-Venezuelan ties after Washington this week blacklisted Maduro's Vice President Tareck El Aissami on drug charges in the first bilateral flare-up under new U.S. President Donald Trump. \nVenezuelan officials have reacted furiously to that, though they appear to be trying to avoid provoking Trump. \n\"I don't want problems with Trump,\" Maduro said on TV on Wednesday, adding that CNN had become \"an instrument of war.\" \nIn various calls with Latin American leaders, Trump has been expressing concern over the Maduro government, though it remains unclear how much of a foreign policy priority Venezuela is. \nOPEC member Venezuela is immersed in a deep economic crisis, with inflation in triple digits, shortages of basic goods, and many people going hungry. \nMaduro, whose popularity has plunged during the crisis, blames the problems on an \"economic war\" waged by the United States and local opponents with the complicity of foreign media. \nOpponents say he has become a dictator, jailing opponents, sidelining the opposition-led congress and delaying local elections. Government officials say opponents are seeking a coup. \nForeign journalists are finding it increasingly hard to obtain visas to operate in Venezuela, and two Brazilian reporters said they were expelled at the weekend while trying to investigate unfinished works by construction giant Odebrecht.
