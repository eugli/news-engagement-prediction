Navarro could test him in the final, the Lake Nona senior comes in on a roll after a district championship. 113 \n2: Chris Fragale (Palm Harbor) \n3: Manny Rameriz (Strawberry Crest) \n4: Anthony Vitale (Steinbrenner) \nWrestler who could prove me wrong: Saul Mayorga (Kissimmee Osceola) \nNon-finals match I’d like to see: A potential quarterfinal match between Fragale and Vitale. \nThe buzz: On paper this weight class looks top heavy, but they don’t wrestle on paper. Still, I see this playing out with a district final rematch happening between Bush and Fragale. 120 \n1: Malyke Hines (Kissimmee Osceola) \n2: Edward Marshall Craig V (Manatee) \n3: Johnathan Brabazon (Tampa Plant) \n4: Jake Spray (Strawberry Crest) \nWrestler who could prove me wrong: Gabriel Naranjo (Palm Harbor) \nNon-finals match I’d like to see: A potential quarterfinal between Craig and Steinbrenner’s Justin Moran. \nThe buzz: The finals in this one could be the same finals next weekend in Kissimmee. 126 \n1: Tommy Barker (Tampa Freedom) \n2: Gabriel Etienne (Melbourne) \n3: Braydon McLellan (North Port) \n4: Luis Pena (Kissimmee Osceola) \nWrestler who could prove me wrong: Truman Noble (Steinbrenner) \nNon-finals match I’d like to see: A potential quarterfinal match between McLellen and Noble \nThe buzz: Barker is the one to beat in this one and I expect that he won’t be beaten. 132 \n1: Hunter Reed (Lakewood Ranch) \n2: Jacob Darr (Sickles) \n3: Jose Cuevas (Kissimmee Osceola) \n4: Mitchell Carlson (Steinbrenner) \nWrestler who could prove me wrong: Lucas Pancake (St. Cloud) \nNon-finals match I’d like to see: Potential quarterfinal match between Carlson and Strawberry Crest’s Chase Zimmerman. \nThe buzz: There are some guys that could end up on the podium next weekend in Kissimmee, but none of them will knock Reed off the top this weekend. 138 \n1: Cullen Telfair (Strawberry Crest) \n2: Ryan Brown (Lakewood Ranch) \n3: Demetrius Anderson (St. Cloud) \n4: Jeffery Mercado (Kissimmee Osceola) \nWrestler who could prove me wrong: Elijah Gray (Lakeland) \nNon-finals match I’d like to see: A potential quarterfinal match between Mercado and Wireless Ranch’s Kaipo Frietas. \nThe buzz: The top two guys in this bracket should meet in one semifinal and the rest will battle it out for the other two spots. 145 \n1: Gavin Mitchiner (Palm Harbor) \n2: Jose Aguilar (Bartow) \n4: Alex Kiester (Tampa Freedom) \nWrestler who could prove me wrong: Chas Waller (Strawberry Crest) \nNon-finals match I’d like to see: A potential quarterfinal match between Mitchiner and LeBarre looms large. \nThe buzz: The bottom of this bracket is loaded with talent and some good wrestlers will be left out of this one. 152 \n1: Blake Fuller (Kissimmee Osceola) \n2: Daniel Cunningham (Manatee) \n3: Avery Royster (Tampa Freedom) \n4: Trenton Davidson (Strawberry Crest) \nWrestler who could prove me wrong: Eric Bunch (St. Petersburg) \nNon-finals match I’d like to see: A potential quarterfinal between Royster and Bunch \nThe buzz: All four district champions come in with a resume that states they could win this weight class – and any of them could be a region champ. 160 \n2: Devin Praesel (Wireglass Ranch) \n3: Ethan DeLong (Kissimmee Osceola) \n4: Alex Fellove (Tampa Sickles) \nWrestler who could prove me wrong: James Totten (Palm Harbor) \nNon-finals match I’d like to see: A potential semifinal between DeLong and Small. \nThe buzz: Three of the state’s best are in this weight class and they all have a claim for the region title. 170 \n1: Bryce Bakken (St. Cloud) \n2: Gamaniel Calderon (East Bay) \n3: Harry Combs (Strawberry Crest) \n4: Matthew McAleer (Manatee) \nWrestler who could prove me wrong: Gabriel Schroder (Wharton) \nNon-finals match I’d like to see: A potential quarterfinal match between Calderon and Combs. \nThe buzz: Five or six guys could win this weight class and it would make sense. This is a tough one to win – and predict. 182 \n1: Hamid Salahutdin (Tampa Sickles) \n2: Joe Hatfield (Strawberry Crest) \n3: Anthony Burburija (Countryside) \n4: Sebastian Johnson (East Bay) \nWrestler who could prove me wrong: Brandon Dossey (Manatee), Jhamel Williams (Kissimmee Osceola) \nNon-finals match I’d like to see: A potential quarterfinal match between Hatfield and Dossey. \nThe buzz: Salahutdin’s road to the final seems relatively clear – whoever makes it on top will be battle-tested. 195 \n1: Kevin Clayton (East Bay) \n2: Chase Sharp (Lakewood Ranch) \n3: Austin Gould (Sarasota) \n4: Jacob Mason (Palm Harbor) \nWrestler who could prove me wrong: Cody Johns (Durant) \nNon-finals match I’d like to see: A potential quarterfinal match between Clayton and Gould. \nThe buzz: Clayton hasn’t lost yet this season, so he gets the nod, but this won’t be an easy weight class to navigate and stay that way. 220 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:08:01.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
