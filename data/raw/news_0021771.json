Lorri McEachern says the driver of the four wheeler took off after the officer turned on the lights atop his cruiser, stranding the two “intoxicated” men outside the restaurant.\nShe says the driver raced through the parking lot, across the highway and onto the frozen Miramichi River, still towing the couch through much of his escape.\nTwo local men, aged 28 and 39, will face yet-to-be-determined charges.\n  McEachern says it is illegal to tow a couch through a drive-thru, but the two men were wearing helmets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:28:14.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
