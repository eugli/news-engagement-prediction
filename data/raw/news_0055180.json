(Photo: Michael Rozman/Warner Bros.) \nHistoric Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay is ready to hand out rose boutonnieres sprinkled with her black girl magic on the upcoming season of the reality show, but admits she was devastated after being dismissed by Nick Viall on the current season of The Bachelor . \nThe attorney opened up about the split that happened three months ago during Friday's episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show . Lindsay admitted, like the daytime talk show host, she thought the two would end up together and was surprised when she was let go. \n\"I was shocked too,\" Lindsay shared. \"I really thought that Nick and I had a really strong connection, and I was pretty heartbroken when it happened, but I've moved on since then.\" We guess the thought of dozens of men competing for you while traveling the world helps. \n\"I guess he was looking for something else,\" Lindsay reasoned. \"His loss.\" \nWhich begs the question: Who does Viall end up with? Though DeGeneres suspected Lindsay knew the winner, the Dallas native didn't offer up any hints. She did, however, stick up for this season's villain, Corinne Olympios, whom she professed her love for. \n\"Unfortunately, you only get to see some sides of Corinne,\" Lindsay explained to DeGeneres. \"I got to see all sides living in the house with her.\" \nFor guys lining up to date Lindsay, know she's \"a sucker for a great smile.\" \n\"I'm looking for a guy who can make me laugh,\" she revealed. \"I'm looking for a guy who knows exactly what he wants, who's ambitious, ready to start a family, ready to get married, 'cause I'm at that phase of my life.\" \nSee how Lindsay's undoubtedly dramatic journey to find love unfolds when the new season of The Bachelorette premieres May 22.
