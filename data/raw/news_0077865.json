It was really fun, yeah, they were good sports about it,” said Beck.\n“It wasn’t awkward or anything, it was good. They were good sports,” agreed Hartling.\nAs for questions about whether there will be a second date, the pair was sheepish.\n\"I don't know, you'll have to find out,\" said Beck, blushing when asked.\nWith files from CTV Atlantic's Kelland Sundahl \nPhotos Connor Beck and Nick Hartling stand with the dates they found on Kijiji at a Halifax hockey game.
