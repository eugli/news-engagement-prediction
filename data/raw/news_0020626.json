Slot to Alabama Crimson Tide Links \nWith the news the Atlanta Falcons have agreed with Steve Sarkisian to become the Super Bowl runner-up’s offensive coordinator, Nick Saban will once again be searching for a new play-caller. The Alabama head coach released a statement Tuesday afternoon. \n“We appreciate all Coach Sarkisian did for our program during his time here, ” Saban said in a statement. “ He is an outstanding coach, and we wish him the best in his new role as Atlanta’s offensive coordinator. As always, when we have an opening on our staff, we will use it as an opportunity to go out and hire the best coach available.” \nSarkisian is moving on to the NFL less than two months after he was named the coordinator in waiting behind Lane Kiffin , who accepted the head-coaching job at Florida Atlantic. \nSarkisian, a former head coach at Washington and USC, spent last season as an analyst on the Crimson Tide staff and was handed the play-calling duties before the College Football Playoff National Championship Game against No. 2 Clemson on Jan. 9 in Tampa. *** Subscribe to BamaOnLine: Buy 1 month, GET 2 MONTHS FREE *** Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:22:30.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
