One bad scrub session and I'm left red-faced for days. Which is why I'm always looking for gentler formulations. Enter the Juice Beauty Stem Cellular Exfoliating Peel Spray, which—as crazy as it sounds—is a spray-on facial peel with a super-easy-to-use mist-on application process. The treatment itself, which is a superfine mist, is made with a mix of citrus extracts—like grapefruit and lemon leaf—to exfoliate, plus nourishers, like jojoba leaf, aloe juice, and vegetable glycerin, to soften the skin. And then there's the vitamin C, which brightens the complexion following the exfoliation.

After cleansing my face, I gave the sleek silver bottle a shake and liberally sprayed the formula from my forehead down to my neck. The mist itself is lightweight—almost like the texture of my favorite-of-the-moment fragrance, Giorgio Armani's Sì Rose eau de parfum—and when it hits the skin, it cools on contact. I think I sprayed on a total of seven spritzes, which left my face wet but not soaked. From there, I let \"the juice\" soak in for a few seconds before gently rubbing it in with my fingertips. That's when the magic happened. (Warning: It gets a little gross from here on out.) As I was rubbing, dead skin cells starting pilling on my fingers—the peel was literally lifting flakes from my face. How cool, or gross, if you ask my boyfriend, whom I made watch from the sidelines. After about a minute of gentle rubbing, I rinsed my face, sweeping all the residual skin cells into the sink. Once my face was thoroughly clean and patted dry, I gave myself a one-two in the mirror. The result? A slightly red but totally glow-y (and supersoft) complexion. The redness took a few hours to subside, but again, I'm chalking that up to my supersensitive skin and the fact that I'm currently in the midst of testing out an over-the-counter retinoid treatment . (Peel plus retinoid might not have been my smartest skin-care move, but a beauty editor's life is all about living on the edge, am I right?) Aside from the mild redness, I was thoroughly impressed. And a few days later, my skin was still supersmooth, with not a flake in sight.
