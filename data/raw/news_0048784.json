Get what you need today in this early-morning email. On Sunday, a poem, “When Tomorrow Starts Without Me,” was posted to the Facebook page, along with a photo of Cellucci before the crash.\n“Rest Easy Kevin, 1/15/80-2/19/17,” the Facebook post read.\nOn New Year’s Eve, Tina Cellucci wrote a long post saying that her husband had “regressed.”\nAdvertisement\n“Kevin hasn’t had the best few months. He’s given up in therapy and will not participate in PT anymore,” she wrote.\n“He is unhappy . . . we’d all be!,” she wrote.\nLast February, Papadopoulos was sentenced to one year in prison followed by five years probation and 2,000 community service hours helping patients with spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries. Judge Debra Shopteese also ruled that Papadopoulos would have to relinquish his driver’s license until 2021 and complete an advanced driving course.\nWhen asked if Papadopoulos could potentially face more time in prison, Suffolk District Attorney spokesman Jake Wark said, “We can better assess the state of the case after the office of the chief medical examiner makes its findings and we review the evidence, including past medical records related to the crash.”\nOne of the teens in the SUV, Mark Delamere, who was 14 years old at the time of the crash, suffered a serious brain injury and was paralyzed from the waist down.\nIn 2014, Delamere and Joey O’Leary, who was also in the car, organized a street-hockey tournament, “The Kevin Cellucci Classic,” to raise money to help pay for Cellucci’s treatment.\nDavid Abel of the Globe staff contributed to this report.
