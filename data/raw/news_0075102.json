Problem is, there just wasn’t room for cars to go four-wide going into Turn 3, and the second “big one” happened. Screencap via Fox \nSixteen cars in total were damaged in the crash. Johnson was out of the race for sure, remarking to Fox Sports that he believed the wreck was entirely avoidable: Advertisement Advertisement \nThat could have been avoided and it wasn’t called for. From the minute I got off of Turn 2 on the entire back straightaway, I kept getting hit and the rear tires are off the ground. I know there is a lot of energy behind me in the pack, but I didn’t have a chance. I fought it the whole straightaway and finally got turned going into (Turn) 3.﻿ \nFortunately, no one was injured in the pile-up. \nShortly afterwards, another crash happened between when Jeffrey Earnhardt ran into the back of Elliott Sadler as Sadler and Trevor Bayne were both signaling that they were about to pull into the pit lane, reports Fox Sports . Trevor Bayne and Ricky Stenhouse Jr. also got caught up in the chain reaction that ensued. \nWho’s actually going to be left at the end of this race? Are we about to see an upset?
