After being introduced by Apprentice producer Mark Burnett, Trump made his appeal, saying, “They hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place . . . and we know how that turned out. The ratings went down the tubes. It’s been a total disaster. And Mark [Burnett] will never, ever bet against Trump again. And I want to just pray for Arnold if we can for those ratings.” A prayer does seem fitting, actually: God help us all. Trump’s unholy comments sparked a new round in the feud with and Schwarzenegger, who swiftly replied in his own Twitter video : “Hey Donald, I have a great idea. Why don’t we switch jobs? You take over TV, ’cause you’re such an expert in ratings. And I take over your job, so that people can finally sleep comfortably again.” Soon the battle of egos was trending, quickly becoming today’s “did he really say/do/sign that?” moment. Yes, we’d all taken the bait once again, because while President Trump was feeding the news beast with a rant about reality ratings, he and his administration were up to darker, more pressing policy moves. In the last few days alone, those moves include tapping evangelical Christian and creationist Jerry Falwell, Jr. to head an education task force that, in a the desire to stop micromanaging colleges and universities, could free them of the responsibility to investigate sexual assault. Trump’s maneuvers also involve lifting President Obama’s ban on dumping coal debris in water sources , and, today, easing Obama’s recent sanctions on Russia —sanctions levied, mind you, after U.S. intelligence reports found Vladimir Putin and other Russian operatives attempted to intervene in the American election in favor of Trump—allowing tech companies in the U.S. to do business there. Of course, these stories don’t make for the same sort of sexy, click-y headlines as “Trump v. Schwarzenegger: The Apprentice Feud Rages On!” (And while it rages, proves to be some very free advertising for that show.) But consider that this may be exactly Trump and company’s intent: Though he is entirely in over his head as commander-in-chief, Trump is a master of media manipulation. If you pay close enough attention, it’s clear that there is usually a click-y, enticing headline that Trump dangles before the public, while the real outrage is hiding somewhere else under something dreary sounding (and usually featuring fewer celebrities). Trump’s distraction tactic has proved itself over and over (and for those who doubt he has the savvy, no doubt former Breitbart News executive chair Steve Bannon comes in handy here): Consider that Trump’s recent blunder in prattling on about his inauguration crowd size before the wall of heroes at CIA headquarters came on the very same day as the global Women’s Marches, when protesters in the millions came out the day after he was sworn in. Trump rightfully drew outrage for attacking Rep. John Lewis on Twitter (in response to Lewis’s comments that he didn’t view Trump as a legitimate president)—but the feud was also a convenient veil for new reports exploring the connections between Trump campaign staffers, including former campaign manager Paul Manafort, and Russian government officials. As he signed the Dakota Access Pipeline back into action, Trump sold a big, fat falsehood to lawmakers, and later, via his press secretary, Sean Spicer, to the press: that he truly believes millions of illegal immigrants voted in the election and cost him the popular vote. Even the Hamilton cast imploring Mike Pence to consider all Americans when governing (and Trump’s subsequent infuriated tweetstorm ) was a godsend: It allowed the then president-elect to deflect attention from the $25 million settlement he had just paid out to the alleged fraud victims of Trump University. This is not to say that attempting to boost reality TV ratings during a faith-based gathering is completely meaningless: It signals, as ever, Trump’s insecurity, his egotism, his seeming inability to not take the bait—any bait. But it’s vital in the Trump era to recognize that behind every salacious story probably lurks one even more grave, with more expansive impact, deserving of even more attention. In short: America may be Trump’s reality show now, but we don’t have to tune in.
