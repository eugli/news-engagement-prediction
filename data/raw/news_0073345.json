One of the two MIM corporators is currently in touch with Shiv Sena Sources told TOI on Sunday that Sena has approached Gulnaz Salim Qureishi, the newly elected corporator from ward 92 (Bharat Nagar, Bandra east). \"Senior Sena leaders met Gulnaz's huband Salim Qureishi on Sunday,\" said a source. However, Salim denied being in touch with the Sena. \"We are waiting for directions from our leaders in Hyderabad. We will do whatever our leaders say,\" said Salim. Salim left Congress a couple of years ago and has been an active member of MIM. MIM legislator Waris Pathan said MIM corporators would not ditch the party. \"I don't think any of our corporators will switch sides. We have fought and won these two seats with hard work. Both our representatives are committed members of the party,\" said Pathan. After MIM's dismal performance, Pathan had said Muslims backed Congress in a big way. If an MIM corporator joins the Shiv Sena, it will be a big blow to the Hyderabadheadquartered party. MIM has two seats in the state assembly, Byculla and Aurangabad. Its leader Akbaruddin Owaisi had addressed over 30 meetings in the city during the campaign for the BMC polls. But the party won just two seats, Bharat Nagar and Cheetah Camp.
