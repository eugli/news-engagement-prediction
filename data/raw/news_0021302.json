and high-casualty' terror attacks in Paris, Brussels, Nice and San Bernardino.\nThe networks covered those assaults 'extensively,' she admitted on The Lead with Jake Tapper.\nPresident Donald Trump was referring to the 'dozens and dozens of others' that occurred over the last two years when he accused the media of ignoring terror attacks yesterday, Conway said.\n'What the president is saying there, Jake, is that there are other attacks that don't get as much coverage,' the White House official told the CNN host after he aired a clip of Trump making the Monday claim.\nKellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, applauded CNN this afternoon for it's 'amazing coverage' of high-profile terror attacks in Paris, Brussels, Nice and San Bernardino. The networks covered those assaults 'extensively,' she admitted on The Lead with Jake Tapper\nThe White House released a list of 78 terror attacks that they believe were 'underreported' on Monday evening, dating from September 2014 to December 2016.\nTrump's administration said attacks in Orlando , San Bernardino, Brussels , Nice and the Bataclan in Paris 'have not received the media attention they deserved.'\nTapper confronted Conway on Tuesday with video of his network's reporters covering terror on the ground in France, Belgium and the USA.\n'Obviously the very sad incidents that you related were, frankly, CNN did amazing coverage for weeks at a time...The other ones on the list, not so much.'\nTrump's intent, she said, was to make sure Americans are aware of all the attacks taking place around the world.\n'We want people to realize then that's what leads him to want extreme vetting from seven narrowly-prescribed countries in a very temporary way.'\nConway also claimed in the interview with Tapper that networks gave Trump five times as much coverage on the campaign trail as they did terrorism and spent more time covering Prince's death than attacks, based on data from Tyndall,\nTapper noted that Tyndall only includes the three cable evening news shows in its assessment and the data is therefore not reflective of the 'media' as an industry.\nHe also accused Conway of trying to 'spin' Trump's phrasing to distract from his 'offensive' assault on the press, particularly those risking their lives in war zones.\n'I don't intend it as spin. I'm crediting the coverage of CNN and your colleagues across the media gave to these high-profile and high-casualty, very sad, very vicious attacks,' she said.\nBaffled, Tapper again noted that massacres in Paris, Brussels, Nice and San Bernardino were on the White House's list of underreported terror attacks.\n'As were dozens and dozens of others,' she rebutted. 'There seems to be some coverage these days, maybe not here, but definitely elsewhere, that somehow terrorism is not a big problem, or somehow national security is all taken care of - and that's just not true.'\nDISHONEST MEDIA: President Donald Trump accused the media of 'tremendous dishonesty' on Tuesday as he was questioned in the Roosevelt Room of the White House about his claim that news agencies routinely ignore terror attacks\nTrump accused the media of 'tremendous dishonesty' on Tuesday as he was questioned about his claim that news agencies routinely downplay terror attacks.\nThe president said Monday that onslaughts are happening 'all over Europe' but they're not being covered by the 'very, very dishonest press' for reasons that he did not specify.\nHe declined Tuesday, as he attended a listening session with county sheriffs, to shed light on his statement. Trump instead told a reporter asking about the Fourth Estate's motivations for covering up terror attacks that he understands 'the total dishonesty of the media better than anybody' as he renewed his blitz on the unfair press.\n'The media is a very, very dishonest arm,' he stated, interrupting himself to say that 'not everybody' in the press is of ill repute. 'But there's tremendous dishonesty. Pure outright dishonesty from the media,' he added.\nAs some reporters pointed out, a handful of instances the White House had named as underreported terror attacks were the subject of news coverage that lasted 'days on end.'\nThe hastily thrown together report that was several pages long was also littered with spelling errors such as 'ATTAKER' and ATTAKERS' and incorrectly cited the California city that had a terrorist ambush 'San Bernadino' instead of San Bernardino.\nConway later said Trump was referring to the 'dozens and dozens of others' that occurred over the last two years when he accused the media of ignoring terror attacks yesterday. 'What the president is saying there, Jake, is that there are other attacks that don't get as much coverage'\nThe White House released a list of 78 terror attacks that the press had 'ignored' following President Donald Trump's claims that the media was 'very, very dishonest' on Monday night (pictured)\nThe report, several pages long and seemingly hastily thrown together, is littered with spelling errors such as 'ATTAKER', 'ATTAKERS' and incorrectly spelling the California city as 'San Bernadino' (pictured)\nTrump's administration said the attacks in Orlando, San Bernardino, Brussels, Nice and Paris 'have not received the media attention they deserved'. Pulse nightclub was subject to a mass shooting in June 2016 and left 49 people dead and wounded 53\nAmong the attacks named was the Nice, France, truck massacre (pictured) which killed 84 civilians and injuring more than 300 people on July 2016\nOne of the biggest terror attacks over the past two years took place in France, with the Bataclan theater attack in Paris and the Nice truck massacre, both of which were on the list.\nThe Orlando, Florida, nightclub shooting was widely covered in the news for being a terror attack and a hate crime in June 2016. It left 49 people dead and wounded 53 more.\nThe mass shooting and attempted bombing in San Bernardino, California, was also included on the roster. The December 2015 attack ended with 14 dead and 22 wounded.\nThe list of 78 occurrences of terror attacks were worldwide and included who was the subject of the attack and named the persons involved.\nCNN reporter Jim Acosta said it was a 'head scratcher.' His news organization was reportedly one of the first to see the list after being labeled 'fake news' by Trump in December.\nThe White House suggested Tuesday that the document distributed to the media was a list of terror attacks that happened between 2014 and 2016, not just those that were unreported or underreported, in the administration's opinion.\n'Many of them haven't got the attention they have deserved,' Spicer said. 'It's becoming too often that we're seeing these attacks not get the spectacular attention they deserve. And I think it undermines the understanding of the threat that we face around the country.'\nPresident Donald Trump claimed Monday that terror attacks are happening 'all over Europe' but they're not being covered by the 'very, very dishonest press'\nThe Bataclan concert hall was attacked in Paris, France. In the fatal attack 130 people lost their lives and many more were injured on November 13, 2015\nThe president did not provide any examples as he made the claim in front of troops stationed at MacDill Air Force base in Tampa, Florida .\nHis press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters aboard Air Force One after the remarks, 'There’s a lot of instances where I don’t think they’ve gotten the coverage it deserved.'\nHe did not name one, either. 'We’ll provide a list later,' he asserted, indicating in the gaggle that the president may have been thinking of foiled' attacks, in addition to murderous assaults.\nOn it's face, it wasn't obvious what attacks Trump was referring to when he hit the media with the broadside at MacDill.\nHis senior counselor, Kellyanne Conway, had accused the press last week, on MSNBC, of ignoring a terrorism-driven massacre that was found to never have occurred.\n'President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized, and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. Most people don't know that because it didn't get covered,' Conway said.\nThe White House official says she 'misspoke' and meant to say 'terrorists.' Cosmo revealed Monday, however, that she made the mistake in an interview with their magazine, too.\nShe claimed two Iraqi nationals were the 'masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre' in a Jan. 29 interview.\nThe refugees she was referring to were Iraqi, and they were living in Bowling Green, Kentucky, when they were arrested. They did not commit any acts of terror on America soil. Instead, they were taken into custody for trying to send weapons back to Iraq for use against American soldiers.\nThe mass shooting and attempted bombing in San Bernardino, California, killed 14 people in December 2015\nTrump on Monday similarly claimed that there are terror plots that are going unnoticed.\nSpeaking to U.S. Special Forces and U.S. Central Command soldiers, he said, 'We're up against an enemy that celebrates death and totally worships destruction. You've seen that. ISIS is on a campaign of genocide, committing atrocities across the world.\n'Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11, as they did from Boston to Orlando to San Bernardino, and all across Europe,' he said. 'You've seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe, it's happening.'\nHe at that point added: 'It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.'\nThe president moved on without calling attention to any specific terrorist attack he believes the media is covering up. Spicer insisted later that there are 'a lot of instances,' however, that are being 'underreported.'\n'I think the president's comments were very clear at the time,' he told a reporter asking about the president's claim that the media has its 'reasons' for burying terror-related news.\nContinuing, Spicer said, 'He felt members of the media don’t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered,' he explained. 'Protests will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn’t necessarily get the same coverage.'\nThe president's spokesman went on to claim that the press was unfairly covering Trump's travel ban, something the president had brought up earlier in a tweet.\n'Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting,' Trump had said.\nHis senior counselor, Kellyanne Conway, had accused the press last week of ignoring a terrorism-driven massacre that was found to never have occurred. She told Fox she 'misspoke' and meant to say 'terrorists'\nSpicer invoked Trump's gripe in his session with reporters riding Air Force One later.\n'I think sometimes the polls don’t reflect what you see on the media,' he said. 'You see a wide degree of support for the president’s policies to protect this country, to create jobs, to grow the economy. And yet a lot of those stories and success that he’s had – in a mere two and a half weeks in office – aren’t exactly covered to the degree to which they should be.'\nA CNN/ORC poll released Friday showed that 53 percent of Americans oppose the president's plan, which also suspended America's refugee program for 120 days, however.\nHours earlier a CBS News poll found 51 percent don't like Trump's approach.\nThe CNN and CBS polls surveyed Americans in phone calls, as did a Gallup poll. All three showed majorities opposing the policy.\nBut four online polls have found majorities or pluralities of Americans support the president. Those include surveys from Reuters/Ipsos, Rasmussen Reports, Public Policy Polling and YouGov/Huffington Post.\nThe Rasmussen poll, which was limited to likely voters, showed a 52-43 gap in Trump's favor.\nThis is the second page of the terror attack list the White House claims that the media had 'ignored'\nThis page of the report includes the Nice, France, massacre where at least 129 people were killed when a truck drove through a crowd\nSome of the incidents on the list included attacks where no causalities happened\nThe dates of the attack are from September 2014 to December 2016\nThe most recent attack named was in Berlin where a terrorist drove a truck into a Christmas market\nTOP 12 DEADLIEST TERROR ATTACKS NAMED ON WHITE HOUSE'S LIST 1.
