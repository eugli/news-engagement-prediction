Fowler, who worked as an Uber engineer for roughly a year, wrote an incredibly creepy account of a manager’s salacious behavior and the subsequent unfair treatment after her reporting the alleged misconduct.\nJust days later, The New York Times spoke to more than 30 current and former employees and reported that Uber has been involved in a number of lewd and dangerous escapades , including booze-filled ragers, bosom-grabbing, consumption of illicit drugs and a joy-ride in a temporarily hijacked shuttle bus.\nUber CEO Travis Kalanick announced that he hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to conduct an investigation into the original sexual harassment and systemic sexism allegations. Arianna Huffington, the co-founder of the eponymous media outlet Huffington Post, who is now part of Uber’s board of directors, and two other internal employees, are also contributing to the review.

Uber reportedly hired Holder last year to review background checks involving fingerprints.\n“This group is not set up to come up with an accurate analysis of the culture and a tough set of recommendations,” Klein and Kapor wrote, adding that while they respect the people involved in the investigation, it is not nearly impartial enough for a completely accurate assessment.
