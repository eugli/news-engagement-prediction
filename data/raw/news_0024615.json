(moma.org)\nTanavoli's bronze sculpture The Prophet is featured in the installation. Created in 1964, while the artist was in Minneapolis, Minn., it was eventually acquired by MoMA. The artwork features latticework and tubular sections first sculpted in wax or clay, then cast in bronze.\nTanavoli is credited with forging a \"new sculptural idiom,\" according to MoMA.\n'A voice for the artists' The museum's quiet protest is in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order curbing travel to the U.S. last month, which has since been halted by a federal court judge . It halted entry by Syrian refugees and imposed a visa ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Syria, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\nThe Mosque by Ibrahim El-Salahi is another piece freshly installed at MoMA. The Sudanese artist's work is influenced by many forms, including African decorative elements and Arabic calligraphy.
