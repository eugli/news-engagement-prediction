There were 479 accidents and the Command and Control Room of the Dubai Police received 5,268 calls on Sunday during the changing weather conditions, the police said. Motorists are being reminded to not throw caution to the wind, literally, when it comes to driving during rain and fog/haze. Major Mohamed Juma Aman, Director of the Control Room at the General Department of Operations, called on drivers to abide by road rules to make driving safer, adding that accidents occur during fog and rain are fatal because of poor visibility. He appealed to motorists to drive carefully during fog this season and to use hazards when moving from a lane to another. He added that in such conditions, all drivers should ensure their windshields and lights are clear and that their signals are in working condition before they drive. Motorists are also advised to leave enough distance between vehicles, they should reduce speed and change lanes only when necessary. He said that the Dubai Police are patrolling roads to prevent congestion, organise traffic, and intervene in case of an emergency. Major Aman warned people from going to sea or to picnics on land during sandstorm and rain. He said that drivers should check weather conditions before going out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:05:31.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
