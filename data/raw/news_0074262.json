I made sure I took it each day, and I hadn’t been ill. ‘When I went for my scan ... the sonographer told me that she could see two heartbeats. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.’ After giving birth to Connor and Kyle, now ten, Mrs Power decided to change her contraceptive method to the implant, which is inserted into the arm and automatically releases hormones. Doctorrs warned that her high fertility meant there was a small chance her body would reverse the sterilisation, and recommended that Mr Power also have a vasectomy. Pictured, both sets of twins now She said: ‘I’d fallen pregnant once whilst I was taking the Pill, so I couldn’t risk it happening again.’ But five years later she started feeling unwell and decided to take a pregnancy test. It showed she was pregnant again, despite the implant – which is supposed to be more than 99 per cent effective. When she went for her scan, she was in for yet another double shock. ‘I’d had some bleeding, so I wasn’t sure whether the sonographer was going to find a heartbeat at all,’ she said. Mrs Power, from York, met her husband (right) while at college. At 19 she discovered she was pregnant, even though she had been taking the Pill ‘So when she said there were two again in there, it was such a relief, but such a shock again too. [John] didn’t believe me until I actually showed him the scan photo with two heartbeats on.’ After Mrs Power gave birth to Jessica and Ruby, now four, she was sterilised by her doctors. But they warned that her high fertility meant there was a small chance her body would reverse the operation, and recommended that Mr Power also have a vasectomy. Mrs Power said: ‘Doctors said I must produce at least two eggs every time I ovulated each month, so there was a high risk of me falling pregnant with multiples again. ‘They said that after my fallopian tubes had been cut and tied, there was a small risk of them mending themselves again, so they advised that John have a vasectomy operation too, just to be on the safe side.’ She added: ‘I do feel very lucky to have my two sets of twins – even if they ... were a complete surprise.’ Share or comment on this article 22 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:47:28.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
