I reasoned that I couldn't expect the same level of service and I was happy to cop this as part of my sea change. \nStill, two weeks for mail to get from northern NSW to Melbourne stretched the friendship of this reasoning. And when I dared use brown paper rather than an overly engineered \"post pack\", it took nearly a month. Related Content Australia Post chair told to justify CEO pay in Canberra \nThe next problem was that my Australia Post mail redirect didn't work. Some mail simply didn't arrive and items that were successfully redirected took extraordinarily long. \nThen, the cost of a stamp jumped from 70c to $1. It effectively went up by more 100 per cent, as I was keen to use the new \"priority\" system if it meant my mail would be delivered in less than the time that I could walk it there myself.

I pictured Cobb & Co style horse drawn vehicles clicking along rutted dirt roads when I visualised my gifts being ferried to their recipients.

There are only so many uses for skeleton T-shirts in November. SHARE Link Australia Post's service looks stark when compared with Britain's equivalent, Royal Mail. \nOur local \"post office\" (it's a community postal agent rather than a licensed post office, perhaps more important a distinction than I'd realised) wasn't much help. Nor were they with items that never arrived and deliveries that we had not been notified about, including one that was returned to sender before I even realised it was there. \nI would happily avoid picking up parcels from the shop if possible, but notes on orders asking for items to be left at front door are ignored. I come home not to find couriered parcels obediently waiting, but an Australia Post missed delivery notice wedged in the door right next to my sign begging for all deliveries to be left. \nMy measuring stick for a postal service will always be Royal Mail, Britain's system, which exceeded expectations by delivering a letter to my front door at 7am that had been posted in a small village over 450km away the evening before. \nThis was in the days before email was ubiquitous and I understand that Australia is a far bigger and more sparsely populated country than England. Yet knowing that this sort of service is possible makes Australia Post's current service even more stark. \nDespite our innate loyalty to Australia Post, my husband has switched to courier companies for his business, and asks his suppliers to do the same. \nI still get bills and bank statements sent by mail (I like to pore over just how much life is costing me) but only those that have long lead times for payment. \nI am not the only one complaining about Australia Post. If you are in need a sense of solidarity, spend a few moments on Australia Post's Facebook page. \nNews of Fahour's salary simply means that I no longer look to the challenges of our wide-brown land, my interstate move, my country town life, or the incompetence of individual agency owners for responsibility. \nThe blame now clearly sits with every individual involved at a senior level with Australia Post. To allow unseemly pay packets within such a poorly performing business should be inconceivable. \nAs this is a government-owned corporation rather than a private enterprise, surely something should be able to change. Whether or not it is too late to restore the confidence of millions of Australians like me is another question. \nVivienne Pearson is a freelance writer.
