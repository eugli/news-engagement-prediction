We are very sorry for that and it will not repeat itself.’’ \nEarlier, the Chairman of the committee, Stella Uchenna (Enugu-PDP), decried the lateness of the submission by the ministry despite the several notice. \nMs. Uchenna said there is the need for more cooperation between the MDA’s and national assembly committees. \n“On January 30, we requested that you send to us the budget implementation of 2016, the document didn’t reach us. Then on February 9, we wrote a reminder and still we did not get a reply. \n“And because we were short of time, we now wrote requesting for the budget performance for 2016 and the proposal for 2017, and we got the centre and the ministry yesterday.’’ \nMs. Uchenna noted that an early submission of documents would have availed the committee time to understudy them before budget defence. \nThe ministry presented the 2016 budget performance but the committee noted numerous errors and requested that the document be reproduced and sent back to it. \n(NAN) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:10:27.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
