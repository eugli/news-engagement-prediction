Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nPresenter Mark Austin recently revealed he once told his anorexic daughter “if you want to starve yourself to death, just get on with it” after he failed to grasp the seriousness of her condition. \nIn a searingly honest account, the former ITV News journalist said he became so frustrated with the teenager’s unwillingness to eat that he went on the attack and “told her she was being ridiculous”. \nThe broadcaster told how he was in the US covering the American presidential elections in 2012 when his wife, an A&E doctor, called him to say Maddy, then 18, had begun skipping meals, calorie counting and becoming obsessive about food.

She was just a hollowed out person. \n\"At 5am, she wouldn't be in bed because she'd be walking five miles, come rain or snow. \n\"I would see her footprints in the snow going up hills. \n\"It broke my heart.\" Mark doesn't know why his daughter got anorexia (Photo: ITV) Maddy was a promising 800m runner who won national school events (Photo: Facebook) \nThe journalist also confessed he and his family are still unsure of why she got anorexia, adding: \"She just said it was something about control, because she didn't feel worthy. \n\"One day we might find out, but all I know is we went through hell, but we found the help, and we're lucky.\" \nMark originally told The Sunday Times of his daughter's illness. \nHe explained: “She stopped looking like a healthy, the promising 800m runner who won national school events and took part in Olympic trials. \n“Instead, she seemed bent on self-destruction and it broke my heart. \n“The daughter I thought I knew became remote and filled with cunning. \n“She would lie about how much she had eaten and then explode with rage if we challenged her. She was abusive, seemingly possessed by demons she could not - or worse, did not want to control.” Maddy took part in Olympic trials before anorexia got a grip of her (Photo: Trinity Mirror Southern) \nMark, 58, said he thought Maddy was showing him with contempt and that he attacked her for it. \nHe told the Sunday Times magazine: “As a father you have to make a decision and I made the wrong one. \n\"I decided to go on the attack. I told her she was being ridiculous. I told her to get a grip and grow up, to ‘just bloody well eat for Christ’s sake’. \n“I even remember saying ‘If you really want to starve yourself to death, just get on with it’. \n“And at least once, exasperated and at a loss, I think I actually meant it. Maddy is now on the road to recovery (Photo: Facebook) \n“What I failed utterly to grasp was that she was seriously mentally ill and could not see a future for herself. \n“The impact of anorexia on families is devastating.” Read More Teenager who starved herself to look like singer Cheryl shrunk to only 5st 13lbs after developing anorexia \nMr Austin told how Maddy’s weight had fallen to just five stone but incredibly doctors were forced to tell them that she was not considered thin enough to trigger an admission to a full time eating disorder unit. \nFurthermore, as she was 18 years old, she was too old to qualify for child mental health treatment.

The fact is there are not enough resources.” \nThe former war correspondent has previously remarked how the NHS offered “the best emergency health care in the world” for physical problems but warned that help for mental health was underfunded. \nHe added how his family were fortunate to afford private healthcare for Maddy but even then the regimented regime of the treatment unit left her threatening to kill herself. \nEventually, with Maddy suffering from bone marrow failure and covered in sores as her skin was breaking down, it was an NHS service at Farnham hospital in Surrey that saved her life. Mark recently left his role as ITV News presenter (Photo: ITV) \nMr Austin said: “We were lucky to find it and she was lucky to get a place there. \n\"And my point is: why are there not more places like it?
