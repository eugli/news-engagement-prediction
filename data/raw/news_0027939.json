Then said `sorry I`m going through divorce`,\" CBS News reported \nShe then used the plane`s overhead public address system to rant about President Trump and former presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton - calling them both \"a-holes\" and then ranting about her divorce which led to passengers tweeting to United to get a new pilot. \nAbout 20 passengers said they did not feel safe with her in the cockpit and got off the plane. \nUnited Airlines spokesman Charlie Hobart said he did not know why the pilot was allowed on the plane in plain clothes. He said the company will discuss the incident with the pilot. \nThe flight from Austin, Texas, to San Francisco, then took off with a new pilot about 90 minutes late, passengers said.   10:23 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:40:46.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
