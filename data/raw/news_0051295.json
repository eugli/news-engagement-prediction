On the occasion he promised subscribers “more value everyday”. Post Your Comments Malini Bhupta Moneycontrol \nThe Jio juggernaut continued to roll on Tuesday, with Mukesh Ambani announcing the addition of 100 million subscribers on Jio’s 4G LTE network. On the occasion he promised subscribers “more value everyday”. By adding 100 million subscribers in 170 days, Jio has not only created a new milestone but it also pushed up India’s ranking in the broadband access sweepstakes. Following its launch, Jio users have consumed nearly as much mobile data as the entire United States of America does and nearly 50 percent more mobile data than all of China. \nJio, the world’s largest start-up, on Tuesday achieved the feat of on-boarding 100 million subscribers in merely 170 days, while the largest telecom operator Airtel has managed to add 40 million mobile broadband subscribers over a period of six years. In a value conscious market like India, Jio has disrupted the market with its unique launch and free voice offer. \nSpeaking on the occasion, Ambani said: “This milestone belongs to you and everyone who believed in Jio. For 170 days, Jio has added nearly seven customers every single second of every single day. This is an unprecedented level of acceptance for any technology company anywhere in the world.” \nJio’s launch six months ago has clearly demonstrated that consumers in India have the appetite for data, provided it is priced right. Prior to Jio’s launch, incumbent operators were charging Rs 250/GB of data. With Ambani’s Jio Prime Offer, announced on Tuesday exclusively for its 100 million subscribers, the price of 1 GB of data has been beaten down to Rs 10. \nAs promised by Ambani at the annual general meeting on 2 September 2016, Jio subscribers will never have to pay for voice in India – local or on roaming. Last year, Mukesh Ambani had made his voice pricing strategy clear when he said in an interview, “I had met the CEO of Verizon and he had said, ‘Oh in your country you still charge for voice? We stopped doing that long ago.\" This was 2014. The world-over, it has happened. We have been consistently saying this, but nobody believed us.” \nIndia’s telecom sector, forever, has been disrupted following its high decibel launch of Jio’s service late last year, when the company decided to offer voice for free. Currently, 70 percent of the telecom industry’s revenues come from voice services. With the launch of Jio, this business model has been fractured and not all incumbents are prepared to play the data game. \nOther than offering voice services free, Ambani on Tuesday said the company would deliver value every single day to consumers, by offering more data than other players at the same price. Said Ambani, “We will not only match the highest selling tariffs of each of the other leading Indian telecom operators, we will provide 20 percent more data in each of these plans. This is our promise of EVERYDAY MORE VALUE to Jio customers.” In addition to these plans, Jio will also offer its own tariff plans, which would offer more bang for the buck. \nJio, often referred to as the world’s largest start-up, plans to delight consumers with attractive tariffs even after the Happy New Year offer (of free voice and data) ends on 31 March 2017. Ambani announced the launch of Jio Prime Membership programme for the loyal 100 million subscribers, who will now enjoy the same data (1 GB per day) for Rs 303 per month. And to avail this offer, they need to pay a one-time membership fee of Rs 99 only. Jio also intends to bring extreme value plans exclusively for the Jio Prime Members. \nWhile this may be good for consumers, Jio’s aggressive pricing strategy has had an impact on other operators. In the December quarter, revenues of listed telecom players declined by 2.8 percent while profit after tax declined 68 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:21:11.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
