He moved to Manchester City before a move across the pond to their sister club New York City Football Club. \nHowever despite that fact the former West Ham United youth product remains a legend at Stamford Bridge. It's no surprise really considering he's their record top goal scorer. \nAnd according to reports today Lampard has already returned to Stamford Bridge and more specifically Cobham Training Centre to work with the academy as he works towards his UEFA B licence. \nThe 38 year old left New York at the end of the MLS season and had been linked with new clubs, including some in the Premier League, but decided to retire at the beginning of this month. \nTalking about the former midfielder current Chelsea boss Antonio Conte said about his new coaching career, \"Frank is a legend for this club and now I think he's starting a new career. \n\"Now is the time to take the best decision for him, it's not easy because I passed this moment [when I retired]... \n\" But Frank can work in football and can work as a coach. He can do it very well.\" \nLampard isn't the only Blues legend working on his coaching badges based on John Terry's recent Instagram post: A photo posted by John Terry (@johnterry.26) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:38am PST \nWith Patrick Vieira and Mikel Arteta deciding against joining Arsenal's backroom staff in favour for positions in the Manchester City group Chelsea will be happy Lampard decided against doing the same. \nLampard joins Steven Gerrard as recently retired midfielders to have returned to their former clubs and the prospect of them both managing in the future is quite tasty: What if Giggs manages #MUFC , Gerrard at #LFC , Lampard at Chelsea, Henry at Arsenal. Who will manage Manchester City?
