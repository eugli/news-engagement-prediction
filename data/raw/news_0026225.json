Damn right. Exactly right. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.\n\"And you know why we're saying that? We're saying that because if I, a guy who knows this business, if I did a tenth of what she did, I would be in jail today.\"\nDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton (Photo: Reuters) Over the Christmas period - before Trump took office - Mike Flynn privately discussed US sanctions against Russia with the country's ambassador.\nRead More Who is Mike Flynn and why did he quit as Donald Trump's National Security Adviser? The phone call would appear to be in breach of the Logan Act, a law dating back to 1799, which bans unauthorised citizens from negotiating with foreign governments over national disputes.\nNo-one has ever been prosecuted under the Act, but the law carries a potential jail term of up to three years.\n(Photo: AFP) The FBI found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing in Clinton's use of a private email server.\nWhile the FBI said Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" in sending and receiving a \"very small number\" of classified emails using the server, they could find no evidence that Clinton's email server was ever successfully hacked.\n Politics Newsletter Follow @MirrorPolitics Subscribe to our Politics Donald Trump Hillary Rodham Clinton Republican National Convention State Department Politics", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3834/4221396001_5322547875001_5322544578001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2198/4221396001_5321730828001_5321712272001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorPolitics", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/894/4221396001_5322572290001_5322558431001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3734/4221396001_5321844261001_5321833608001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1394/4221396001_5322578986001_5322571765001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1926/4221396001_5322526663001_5322513350001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/638/4221396001_5322564118001_5322542315001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1054/4221396001_5322579232001_5322570555001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1806/4221396001_5321829986001_5321822273001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001"], "published": "2017-02-14T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:07:51.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
