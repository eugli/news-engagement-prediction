(Kevin Mazur/Getty Images) \n“We have built Kanye West into some kind of god-like idol, I believe he’s a genius when it comes to writing and producing but he’s human. When we build people into idols we have expectations, and if they fail to meet those expectations we crucify them,” the anonymous artist, who goes by Plastic Jesus, said in a statement. \n“We saw this last year when Kanye was admitted to a medical facility to get treatment for stress, anxiety and paranoia. We need to take a step back and remember our idols are only human and as such we need to give them space to err.” \nPlastic Jesus has previously created a life-size Oscar statue on all fours snorting cocaine and another one with a heroin needle in its arm after Philip Seymour Hoffman’s death.
