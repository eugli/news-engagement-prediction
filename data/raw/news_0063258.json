(Kevin Dietsch/European Pressphoto Agency) In remarks at the National Museum of African American History and Culture on Tuesday, President Trump said :\nIt’s a privilege to be here today. This museum is a beautiful tribute to so many American heroes — heroes like Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Rosa Parks, the Greensboro students, and the African American Medal of Honor recipients, among so many other really incredible heroes.\nIt’s amazing to see. I went to — we did a pretty comprehensive tour, but not comprehensive enough. So, [museum director Lonnie Bunch], I’ll be back. I told you that. Because I could stay here for a lot longer, believe me. It’s really incredible.\nOne wonders what Trump actually learned there. The list of African American heroes is the sort of superficial boilerplate you’d expect from a White House unfamiliar with the museum and the rich, complicated and fascinating history it illustrates. Seriously, an enterprising reporter should ask him what he saw that he did not know previously or that helped him to understand better the lives of African Americans and the country as a whole.\nIf, for example, he was paying attention to the galleries highlighting the Civil Rights era he might not throw around the term “states’ rights” so cavalierly in the future.\nIf he looked at the gallery covering the most recent time period in American history and the many upstairs galleries highlighting African Americans in sports, literature, music, business, medicine, the media and more he might not say things like : “You’re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?” He might realize most African Americans do not live in poverty and are employed.\nIf Trump paid attention to the displays on Jim Crow, he might have disowned the alt-right/white nationalist groups long ago, seeing them as the modern incarnation of the KKK, the John Birch Society and run-of-the-mill racists. He might even tell Stephen K. Bannon (who at Breitbart helped elevate the white nationalists’ message and made Milo Yiannopoulos a right-wing media star) to leave or at least apologize to the many groups and individuals his former outlet has insulted, stereotyped and mocked over the years.\nIf he saw the displays on the long history of housing discrimination and segregation, he might make amends for his own conduct that was the subject of a housing discrimination lawsuit in the 1970s (subsequently settled). He might even make certain his HUD secretary will staunchly enforce anti-discriminatory housing rules.\nIf Trump had paid attention throughout the galleries, he’d have seen a major theme was that American history is African American history and African American history is American history. He would therefore reject the notion that one can separate and characterize African Americans as “the blacks,” as if they are a monolithic group which stands apart from the rest of “us.”\nIf Trump saw Emmett Till’s casket, the watch tower from the Angola Prison in Louisiana and the history of discriminatory policing and racial profiling he might not dismiss out of hand the concerns of minority communities about policing. He might even reconsider immigration enforcement policies that will inevitably profile and target certain minorities.\nBut don’t expect any of that to happen. Such a transformation would require focus, reflection and, most of all, empathy — the ability to see the world from someone else’s vantage point. It would require acknowledging that his biases and wrongheaded views (the cops are always right, all African Americans live in poverty, etc.) do an injustice to the real experience of African Americans. C’mon, does anyone really think Trump is capable of such things?\nopinions\n\nright-turn\nOrlando Shooting Updates\nNews and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.\npost_newsletter348\nfollow-orlando\ntrue\nafter3th\nfalse\n\n\nPlease provide a valid email address. \nSign up You’re all set!
