At least one young person dies from an undiagnosed heart condition every month in Northern Ireland, according to statistics from British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland.\nThese people are unaware that they are at risk before their sudden death.\nUndetected heart conditions can be deadly and devastate families, often by taking away loved ones without warning.\n17,500 people living with a faulty gene that puts them at risk of heart attack or sudden death The charity estimates that around 17,500 people in Northern Ireland are living with a faulty gene that puts them at high risk of a heart attack at a young age or sudden death.\nIn addition to these thousands there are more people at risk of dying prematurely because of other non-genetic heart defects including abnormal heart rhythms. For many families, the first sign there's a problem is when someone dies suddenly with no obvious cause or explanation.\nBHF-funded research has helped to pioneer technology like implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ICD implants which treat a dangerous heart rhythm as well as discovering many of the faulty genes that cause inherited heart conditions. However, more research is urgently needed to better detect and treat these conditions to stop the devastation brought to loved ones.\nHilary Niblock from Lisburn lost her son Kris on 18 June 2014, just days before his 21st birthday. The youngest in the family of three children loved cars and was outside their home working on a friend's car when he suddenly collapsed.\nKris Niblock died before his 21st birthday from an electrical fault in his heart. Hilary said: \"I had picked Kris up from his job in Tesco. It was a lovely evening so we were getting ready to have a barbecue and Kris was out working on his friend's car.\n\"His friend came running in and said Kris is lying at the side of the car. We thought maybe he's been electrocuted. The ambulance came and rushed him to Lagan Valley Hospital.\n\"When he got there they must have worked on him for two to three hours but there was nothing more they could do. Nothing can prepare you hearing that. I just kept thinking this can't be happening.\"\nThe Niblock family were all tested for an inherited heart condition but later discovered Kris's death was due to an electrical fault in his heart.\nHilary added: \"I know now there was nothing we could have done but you're tortured by thoughts of what if? What if we had known?\n\"Kris was my youngest and was the wee boy I had always wanted. I always felt he was someone special. Everyone who knew him talks about his big smile. He was so quiet and unassuming and would have done anything for anyone.\n\"I don't want any family to go through what we've gone through. More research is needed so no family has to suffer the loss of their child so unexpectedly.\"\nThere are people out there who kiss their loved ones goodnight or goodbye in the morning and don't wake up or don't come home.\n– Karen McCammon, BHF specialist nurse Karen McCammon, specialist heart nurse with BHF NI said: \"The reality is that there are thousands of people across Northern Ireland who are unaware that they could be at risk of sudden death because from the outside they are perfectly healthy.\n\"Thanks to the public's kind support, BHF-funded researchers have made major discoveries in these frightening heart conditions but we urgently need to fund more research to better understand these heart conditions, make more discoveries, develop new treatments and save more lives.\"\nThe BHF has launched a new television campaign to raise awareness of the sudden devastation caused by heart disease. In the advert, a bridesmaid suffers a cardiac arrest due to an inherited heart condition on her sister's wedding day.\nThe first television advert airs on Wednesday at 5.45pm during The Chase on UTV.\nLast updated Wed 1 Feb 2017 Health Northern Ireland Belfast", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:09:15.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
