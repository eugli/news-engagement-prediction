Here are our highlights of three selections you should sit and watch poste haste, followed by the full list. Jaws —Gone March 1 \nDo you love modern-day summer blockbuster franchise movies? Then you owe all your thanks to the Steven Spielberg classic about a shark terrorizing a town. Seriously scary, the flick was the first major summer ticket seller before Star Wars set the pace. It also spawned three sequels, each one with diminishing returns on that \"scary\" and \"ticket-selling\" option. All the sequels are also leaving Netflix on March 1, so...binge-watch marathon time! (As of March 4, they'll all be exclusively available on Starz.) \nIt's not as good as their original time-traveling adventures in a phone booth—the second best franchise to use that method—but the sequel to the Excellent Adventure of Ted Logan and Bill S. Preston, Esq. still Mega Shark vs. Mecha Shark —Gone March 29 \nThe weirdos at The Asylum bring you the ultimate rip-off of Godzilla and their own Sharknado —the third in the Mega Shark series. I mean... just try to look away. And yes, the blonde doctor on the phone is definitely 80s mall-pop star Debbie Gibson.
