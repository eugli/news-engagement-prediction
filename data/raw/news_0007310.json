Hydro to delay the destruction of a wetland used as a nesting ground for a rarely-seen bird.\nWatson Slough is a popular birding site, with trails maintained by Ducks Unlimited and listed as a \"hot spot\" by the National Audubon Society.\nIt is also scheduled to be logged this month as B.C. Hydro prepares for the Site C dam project and eventually flooded as the dam is complete.\n\"I really hope they don't go ahead now,\" said wildlife biologist Mark Phinney in a phone interview as he and other wildlife enthusiasts hiked through the slough to mark World Wetlands Day . \"There's no need to do that just yet.\"​\nWatson Slough is listed as a tourist destination by several provincial guides due to the range of birdlife found in the area. (Donald Hoffman)\nHe's concerned about species like the yellow rail, a secretive wading bird that nests in the wetland.\n\"There's relatively few known locations in the province where they actually nest, so it's really quite important,\" said Phinney.\n'Species of concern' would lose nesting ground The yellow rail is  listed as a \"species of special concern\" under Canada's Species at Risk Act and red-listed provincially because it is found in very few places in the world. It is considered particularly sensitive to human development.\nYellow rails are known to be secretive birds that only sing in the middle of the night, making tracking their presence very difficult for researchers. (Audobon.org)\nThe yellow rail isn't the only creature to use the slough — over 120 bird species have been sighted there over the last few years, along with mammals and some rare plant species.\n\"They are one of the most productive ecosystems on the planet,\" wrote science columnist Torah Kachur  for a feature on the importance of wetlands to biodiversity.\n\"Wetlands are the world's nurseries.\"\nDon't drain the swamp! Why wetlands are so importan t\nWatson Slough is unique to the Peace River region. It contains the area's only \"marl fen\" ecosystem, created by lime-rich marlstone seeping into a wetland, as well as several uncommon \"tufa seep\" ecosystems.\nWatson Slough falls within Site C's flood reservoir, marked by the blue lines on this map from B.C. Hydro. (B.C. Hydro)\nAlthough BC Hydro has committed to working with Ducks Unlimited to offset the destruction by building new wetlands, both marl fens and tufa seeps are impossible to recreate.\nThis prompted a  federal and provincial joint review panel  on the project to call the effects of Site C on wetland as \"permanent and irreversible.\"\nAn alternative to Site C known as Site 7B would have preserved Watson Slough but it was rejected as being more expensive while producing just 24 per cent of Site C's power.\nThe Peace River Regional District has asked B.C. Hydro to put off the logging for as long as possible while the dam is constructed.\nB.C. Hydro has not yet responded to a request for comment from CBC, but spokesman Dave Conway told a local news outlet the crown corporation is aware of the request and is reviewing it.\nPhinney doesn't see why logging would have to begin so early.\n\"This area's awfully small and could be cleared quite efficiently in a week or two at most,\" he said.\nHe hopes the yellow rail can get a few more breeding seasons in before losing one of their few known nesting grounds.\n\"Every year counts for them, every year they can raise another family and help the population.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:28:44.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
