The Western Sydney Wanderers will be responding to the notice within the time frame provided. \n“Notwithstanding that the Club has yet to submit its response, Western Sydney Wanderers FC unequivocally states - and reinforces its position provided on Sunday after the match - that it does not in any capacity welcome, authorise or condone the display of imagery depicted in a banner on Saturday night. It is an affront to many on a multitude of levels and is completely unacceptable. \n“We are currently working with the venue, security and FFA to identify those involved. The Club will continue to support the rights of our Members and fans who display passionate support for this team in an appropriate, civil and respectful manner and we will not allow our Members and Club’s reputation to be affected by the disrespectful actions of a few. \n“As a club made up of the most diverse and inclusive cross-section of members and fans in Australian sport we are committed to working with FFA and our stadiums to ensure our matches remain a positive family friendly environment.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
