EMSB hearing Tuesday: Save Royal Vale School \nHall says some parents waiting in line showed up on Saturday. \n“I know there’s 32 spots and we got spot 28 and 29,” Hall said. “If I knew it was going to be this close I would have come yesterday.” \nRegistration for kindergarten students and new elementary students is taking place this week at Royal Vale. \nHall said that some parents have been making runs to Tim Hortons for coffee and hot chocolate. \n“I’ve made a schedule with my husband for how we’re going to stay overnight till tomorrow morning,” Hall said. “It’s actually been quite nice, chatting with some of the other parents who are also in the same situation that they really want the best for their child’s education.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
