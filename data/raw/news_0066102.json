And often they would hear the less savoury sides of war too. Because the men would trust them — you see, as women, they weren't so scary to the men, they weren't seen as being as serious in some senses.\" Elizabeth Montizambert became the London editor for the Montreal Gazette after her coverage of WW I. \nOver the course of the war, as they talked to more soldiers, the tone of their reporting changed as well. \nBeatrice Nasmyth even went to great lengths to smuggle stories back to Canada past the censors, who would have extracted anything that shone a negative light on the war efforts. \n\"As the war progressed, the sense of patriotism was dulled,\" Marshall says. \"I think they began to get a very realistic sense that war wasn't just this heroic great thing with the British Empire riding in and saving the day.\" \nA century after the war, Marshall wants to make sure these three reporters are not forgotten. \n\"I couldn't bear the thought that these three women were out there writing these incredible stories,\" says Marshall. \"They had thousands of readers — and now we know nothing about them.\" \nThis segment was produced by The Current's Julian Uzielli and Karin Marley.
