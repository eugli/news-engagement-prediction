Charles Barkley (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 11:14 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 11:14 p.m. ET \nCharles Barkley made like coffee and delivered a classic roast of the Knicks on Thursday night. \nDuring TNT's pregame show, Barkley heckled the network and apologized to viewers incessantly for airing the Knicks-Cavaliers matchup over the Pelicans-Rockets game that was in the same time slot. DeMarcus Cousins made his debut with New Orleans, and the Knicks were trounced by Cleveland, 119-103. \nAfter the game, Barkley didn't ease off the gas in his dislike for the New York franchise. \nWhile TNT aired highlights of the game, Chuck roasted the Knicks some more, this time dropping an s-bomb while he was at it.

The team is 23-35 and 12th in the Eastern Conference, and Porzingis was injured Thursday night. We're not sure anyone really wants to watch this . . .Â stuffÂ anymore. Even Knicks fans. \nKeep doing you, Chuck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:31:18.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
