Using the logic of six degrees of separation, Bayer argued that Gorka was anti-Semitic, never mind that the 3,000-word report did not cite a single instance of Gorka's alleged anti-Semitism.\nThe whole piece smacks of a political hatchet job.\nEli Clifton, a blogger fired by the Center for American Progress — the think tank at the heart of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, and once disavowed by the Obama White House for an alleged anti-Israel obsession — originated the fanciful accusation that Gorka was linked to Hungarian neo-Nazis.\nNo sooner did The Forward publish its piece than the Anti-Defamation League — now led by Jonathan Greenblatt, a former Obama administration official — demanded that Gorka disavow Hungarian hate groups. In effect, the ADL lends it name to a campaign without substance to smear a man against whom no one has found evidence of anti-Semitism.\nGreenblatt's actions follow the logic of the Salem Witch Trials: Only the guilty float when thrown into a pond. In this case, if Gorka does not respond, the ADL can suggest the Trump administration ignores anti-Semitism, but if Gorka does respond even to denounce Hungarian extremism, it suggests legitimacy to the charge.\nIndeed, the obsession with Gorka and all the debunked charges thrown his way should have given Greenblatt and the ADL pause.\nConsider: Gorka was accused of lying about being an expert witness in the Boston Marathon bombing case, but then was able to produce a note from the Department of Justice thanking him for his service in that capacity. Then Michael S. Smith, a terrorism analyst at Kronos Advisory , accused Gorka of faking expertise, only to have Rep. Robert Pittenger, R-N.C., write that it was Smith, not Gorka, who falsified his biography with regard to links to a Congressional anti-terrorism taskforce which Pittenger chaired. Academic terrorism experts who say they do not know Gorka's work may not understand that it is they rather than Gorka who are out-of-touch given Gorka's preference to focus on practitioners rather than the academic theorists.\nI have known Gorka for 13 years. We first met at the Marshall Center in Garmisch, Germany, and have crossed paths repeatedly during conferences and academic programs for United States Special Forces, U.S. Marine Corps University, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. His defining ideology is an appreciation for individual freedom and liberty, having seen forces of both the extreme Left and extreme Right try to deny it to his family and his ancestral homeland. In this, he is less known but little different than a generation of other figures shaped in reaction to the tyranny of communism: Vaclav Havel in the Czech Republic, Radek Sikorski in Poland, or Mikheil Saakashvili in Georgia.\nWhile Gorka may seem like a useful man for left-wing activists to attack as a proxy to attacking Trump himself, especially given how articulate and effective Gorka has been in the media, it is ironic that the ADL and others would imply Gorka to have Nazi sympathies given Gorka's support for Israel as a Jewish state and his articulation that the goal of the Trump administration's counterterror campaign is to make \"the ISIS black flag… as repugnant as the Nazi Swasitka.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Senate confirms Wilbur Ross as commerce secretary Ross was a key economic adviser during Trump's campaign who strongly influenced his views on trade.\nBy Susan Crabtree • 02/27/17 7:19 PM This is not the first time the ADL has substituted partisanship for principle, but every time it does so it cheapens its brand. Likewise, progressives should understand that relying on character assassination rather than substantive discussion will not win the policy debate.\nMichael Rubin ( @ mrubin1971 ) is a contributor to the Washington Examiner's Beltway Confidential blog.
