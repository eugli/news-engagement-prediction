But despite their many similarities, the two men do disagree on a few key issues, as revealed in a promo for Fox’s big Trump-O’Reilly Super Bowl interview , scheduled to air tomorrow before kickoff. Watch Bill O’Reilly’s interview with President @realDonaldTrump Sunday at 4p ET during the #SuperBowl pregame show on FOX. pic.twitter.com/OcRVRK8JgR — Fox News (@FoxNews) February 4, 2017 \nThe key sticking point seems to be Trump’s relationship with Russia and President Vladimir Putin, which O’Reilly—who’s nothing if not pugnacious when he thinks he’s right—pushes Trump on pretty hard. When Trump affirms that he respects Putin (and wants his help hunting ISIS), O’Reilly fires back “Putin’s a killer.” Trump thinks for a second, and then, in a stirring reminder of his belief in the inherent good- and greatness of the American people, responds with “There a lot of killers. We got a lot of killers. What, you think our country is so innocent?” \nThe clip cuts off there, so it’s not clear if Trump, like, names names on this cadre of assassins roaming America’s streets, or starts drawing other parallels between the former KGB officer-turned-strongman-and-head-of-state and the American people. “Americans like to ride shirtless on horseback too, you know,” or “Who doesn’t like annexing the Ukraine?” We’ll see more when the full interview airs tomorrow at 4 p.m. Eastern, on Fox. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:04:49.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
