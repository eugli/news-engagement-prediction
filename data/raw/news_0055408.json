For the first time in more than a decade, the reservior — swollen by weeks of rain has overflowed its banks. \nMatlow said five people had been rescued with others calling for help from the swamped woods. He said a rescue helicopter had been sent away so rescue teams on boats could hear calls for help. \n“We were told there were 20 people in trees, but we don’t have an accurate count,” he said. \nMatlow said the water-borne rescue teams were battling “rising waters filled with debris.” \nIt was the second time a swift water rescue teams had been dispatched to the area. On Monday, three people trapped by the rising waters in an area north of Tuesday’s rescue were pulled from an island in the middle of the creek. . @SJFirefighters complete rescue of two subjects trapped on island in swollen Coyote Creek this afternoon. @SJFD #rescue #flood pic.twitter.com/BG6bpnbUUK \n— C-A-R-ose (@fullfirstalarm) February 20, 2017 \nThe National Weather Service reported the creek was at 13.2 feet Tuesday morning – slightly below the major flooding stage of 14 feet. \nA flash flood warning was issued for the creek Monday evening through Friday morning as 3 1/2 inches of rain fell in the surrounding area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:14:42.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
