Also Read: Apple might keep the best only for the iPhone 8 \nUnlike the iris scanner introduced by Samsung on the now defunct Galaxy Note 7, it will recognize facial features to authenticate the user and unlock the phone. Now a new leak gives more details into how Apple would execute this. \nAccording KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, iPhone 8 will have an upgraded front camera accompanied by an Infrared module (used or TV remote control) that can allow the camera to \"see\" in 3-dimension, which will help it detect facial features, uniquely identify iris of the eye or take '3D selfies'. \nThe infrared (IR) sensor consists of the transmitter receiver pair that will guide the camera. It will send IR signals (which are not visible to the naked eye) and detect signals that are reflected from the surface, telling the camera about the distance, and even probably mapping out contours in the space in front of the camera. \nThe report published on 9to5mac says the new hardware will use algorithms developed by PrimeSense, which Apple acquired in 2013. Israel based PrimeSense developed 3D body-sensing technology for use in Microsoft's Kinect motion gaming controller. \nThe fact that the 3D camera uses a dedicated IR sensor will give it more precision says KGI, and make it unlike anything Android phones would have atleast 2 year down the line. The transmitter-receiver pair will probably use 'vertical-cavity surface-emitting' laser technology from Lumentum, while the front camera is said to be from Sony and the IR receiver from Foxconn/Sharp. \nWe said earlier that Apple would be keeping most of the advanced tech for the almost bezel-less iPhone 8 -- like the OLED display, wireless charging, better water resistance and, the 3D front camera. Though two other variants will also launch alongside -- the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus -- incremental upgrades to the 2016 version.

So Apple might leave out the fingerprint sensor altogether until the 2018 version, if at all it perfects the face-recognition camera on the iPhone 8.
