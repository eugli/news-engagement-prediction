Big Sean released his new album today called “I Decided.” On the song “No Favors,” Big Sean teamed up with Eminem, who rapped one of the verses, and he minces no words when talking about our Commander in Chief. \nOn the verse he says, “I’m anti, can’t no government handle a commando / Trump’s a b*tch / I’ll make his whole brand go under.” \nThis isn’t the first time Eminem has gone after Trump. In October, he released an explosive freestyle called “Campaign Speech” that slammed both the then-candidate and his supporters, saying: “But you should be afraid of this dang candidate / You say Trump don’t kiss ass like a puppet / ‘Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin’ / And that’s what you wanted / A f*ckin’ loose cannon who’s blunt with his hand on the button / Who doesn’t have to answer to no one—great idea!” \nSo, it’s safe to say there’s no love lost there. \n[featured image via screen grab] \nHave a tip we should know?
