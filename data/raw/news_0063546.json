It would make my life better,\" he said. \nThe ombudsman's report noted the council's monitoring of the savings was \"intermittent and inadequate\" and amounted to maladministration. \nThere was no criticism of the foster carers in his report, which only dealt with the council's actions. \nThe council failed to keep adequate records or retain his saving books at the end of his placement, meaning it was unclear why the amounts were as low as they were.
