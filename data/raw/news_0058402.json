Later, Ray J chatted about new music, saying that he has a Spanish-language album that’s ready to be released. \nElsewhere at the event, Berry Gordy and protégé Jadagrace chatted with Eric Benét , and, at 1 a.m., Melissa Etheridge picked up a guitar and started singing in a dark corner of the rooftop, as guests gathered in disbelief. \n5H’s Ally Gives Album Update \nAt the Republic Records-FIJI Water Grammys afterparty at Catch LA on Feb. 12, The Weeknd was toasting a stellar Grammys performance, James Corden was noshing, and Fifth Harmony ’s Ally Brooke Hernandez was visibly nervous before greeting Stevie Wonder .

Keilly’s pre-Grammy lounge at the McLaren Auto Gallery in Beverly Hills, raving about the direction of the girl group’s next album. \n\"We’re in the studio, working really, really hard,” she said. \"We’re able to write more on this album. For the first time, we’re having a lot of creative control and input, and that is something we are so, so excited about. We’re very happy to be in control of it and to have our voices really on it through the lyrics, through the writing, [which is] something we’ve never really been able to do before as a group.\" \nCommon Serenades Burning Sands Star \nDays after Common was announced as an executive producer for Netflix’s upcoming fraternity hazing drama Burning Sands , the 44-year-old rapper was at the Wanderluxxe and SAG Indie-hosted afterparty on Jan. 24 for the film’s Sundance premiere in Park City, Utah, rhyming directly to the film’s 27-year-old co-star, Nafessa Williams. During a 30-minute set that included a cover of Biz Markie ’s “Just a Friend,” Common freestyled about how beautiful and talented Williams was -- and how he may need to marry the former soap opera actress someday. “I’m sure you’re all going to Snapchat and Instagram this,” sang the single MC, who is also contributing a new song, “The Cross,” to the Burning Sands soundtrack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:39:32.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
