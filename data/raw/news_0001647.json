(Photo: Gillis Benedict/Livingston Daily) \nSofia Tepper was only 5 years old when she auditioned for her Hollywood debut. \nThe Brighton third grader, now 8 , makes her big screen debut Friday in the Michigan-made horror-mystery film \"Eloise.\" The movie opens in select theaters, on iTunes and on video on-demand. \nSofia's character plays a key role in the film's plot line, which centers on four friends exploring a former mental asylum, a real place called the Eloise complex. The former asylum in Westland is rumored to be haunted . Although she does not speak in the film, Tepper's character — credited as \"Little Girl\" — appears in flashbacks and visions of main character Pia, played by actress Eliza Dushku, as her younger self. \nRead more: \nBrighton's Sofia Tepper is shown on the bottom of this poster for \"Eloise,\" a horror movie that was made in Michigan. (Photo: Courtesy of Vertical Entertainment) \nHer likeness also appears in a painting shown in the movie. And she is the creepy little girl holding a box on the movie poster. \nIt might be a while until she is old enough to watch the movie from beginning to end, but her parents have promised her they will buy a digital copy and fast-forward to her parts, so she'll get a chance to see herself on screen, her mother Sheila Tepper said. \nSofia said she wasn't jealous when her parents went to see the movie Tuesday night at an early premiere at an MJR movie theater in Troy and left her behind. \"My parents explained they had to see it first. It's OK,\" she said. \n\"Since the movie is R-rated, I thought that would be best,\" Tepper said. \"When we did the filming, there was some pretty gross stuff.\" \nBut the Shepherd of the Lakes Lutheran School student remembers good experiences on set. \n\"When my mom told me I was in a movie, I was excited. I knew it was going to be scary,\" Sofia said. \nWatching the makeup and props departments at work helped her understand the horror wasn't real. \n\"They put on the scary makeup, and, when they were making some of the props, I wasn't scared because I got to see how they do it,\" she said. \nSofia said Dushku was kind to her. She liked getting made up into her character in a dressing room. And she was impressed by what she perceived as unlimited snacks at the craft services table. A place among the stars \nThe film, which was shot in metro Detroit in 2014, is the first feature film produced by metro Detroit's Sanford Nelson. It was directed by Robert Legato and written by Chistopher Borrelli. It was approved for nearly $2 million in the now-ended Michigan film incentives on an estimated $7 million in spending. \n(Photo: Tom Pidgeon) \nStars of the film include \"Gossip Girl\" actor Chace Crawford, metro-Detroit native Brandon Jackson (\"Tropic Thunder\"), Robert Patrick (\"Terminator 2: Judgement Day) and Dushku (\"Dollhouse,\" \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\"). \nThe story follows Crawford's character as he discovers that he must solve the mystery of what happened to his aunt, a former asylum patient, in order to inherit his family's money. The trailer for the movie suggests that Eloise was a nightmarish place. \nThe real-life Eloise complex, located on Michigan Avenue in Westland, has a long history as a former poorhouse, mental hospital, tuberculosis sanatorium and county hospital. It also has a reputation in paranormal circles as being one of the most haunted places in Michigan. Model turned actress \nSophia landed the role in \"Eloise\" after her mother signed her up with a modeling agency. \n\"She was just a really cute baby, but I never pushed her into anything. Getting the role was really random. It was the first and only thing she's ever done,\" Tepper said. \nSophia also sings in school musicals, and she once was a model for a painting created by ArtPrize artist Sharon Lange called \"The Light of Faith.\" \n\"I think Sofia had no clue she was in it with actors in a lot of TV shows and movies,\" Tepper said. \"But she knows that now.\" \nSofia said she's willing to try for another role, although she's not convinced it will be her career choice. \n\"Yeah, I would be in a movie again, and I kind of do want to get into some acting in school,\" Sofia said. \nBut she has no idea what she wants to be when she grows up. How to watch \n\"Eloise\" will be released by Vertical Entertainment to a limited number of theaters Friday. Theaters showing the movie in the region include Goodrich Quality 16, in Ann Arbor, AMC Star Fairlane 21, in Dearborn, Emagine, in Royal Oak, and AMC Forum 30, in Sterling Heights, according to Fandango. \nThe film will also be available on iTunes and video on-demand services. \nDetroit Free Press Pop Culture Critic Julie Hinds contributed to this article.
