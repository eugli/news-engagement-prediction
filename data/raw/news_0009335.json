The billionaire property magnate has been the butt of more scathing rebukes and wisecracks from tinsel town actors than any President in recent history. \nThis makes it all the more surprising Matthew McConaughey has gone against the grain and provided a positive perspective on Mr Trump's presidency. The Oscar-winning actor, who is known for his roles in Wolf of Wall Street and True Detective , urged Hollywood to “embrace” Mr Trump.\nMcConaughey argued Americans should learn to be “constructive” even if they do not agree with the President.\nAppearing on the Andrew Marr Show , he was pressed about whether it was time for Hollywood to give the President a break.\n“Every single American actor or the arty type who comes over to London dumps on Trump you all completely hate him. Do you think its time maybe Hollywood or the cultural elite of America gave this guy a break,” asked Marr.\n“They don’t have a choice now,” McConaughey replied. “He’s our president. It’s very dynamic and as divisive of a time and inauguration as we’ve had, at the same time, it’s time for us to embrace. Shake hands with this fact, be constructive with him over the next four years.“\nThe controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 10 show all The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 1/10 Trump and abortion Protesters flood Independence Avenue during the Women's March\nGetty\n2/10 Trump and abortion US President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus looks on in the Oval Office of the White House\nGetty Images\n3/10 Trump and 'Obamacare' Nancy Pelosi who is the minority leader of the House of Representatives speaks beside House Democrats at an event to protect the Affordable Care Act in Los Angeles, California.

The number of incoming immigrants has surged ahead of the upcoming Presidential inauguration of Donald Trump, who has pledged to build a wall along the US-Mexico border\nGetty Images\nThe actor suggested Americans should look for ways to be “constructive” even if they disagree with the President.\n“Even those who most strongly may disagree with his principles or things he’s said or done - which is another thing, we’ll see what he does compare to what he has said - no matter how much you disagreed with the way, it’s time to think how constructive can you be. Because he’s our President for the next four years, at least”.\nWhile the Texan actor’s interview aired on Sunday morning - days after Mr Trump implemented his hardline immigration ban - it is unclear when the interview was recorded and may have been pre-taped. McConaughey’s wife Camila Alves is an immigrant from Brazil who moved to the US at the age of 15. \nThis appears to be the first time, McConaughey, who rarely speaks out on politics, has discussed Mr Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:21:54.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
