Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com TownNews.com Content Exchange \nJUPITER, Fla. • That adventuresome and memorable day Kolten Wong spent in the Wrigley Field outfield as a sudden left fielder has had ramifications that continue into spring training. \nWong has been placed on a throwing program this spring that limits the amount of throws and the effort he puts into those throws. That's not unusual for spring training, and Kevin Siegrist has been on a similar program for a pitcher. It's the cause of Wong's shoulder discomfort that echoed Saturday afternoon when he explained that it traced all the way to slip in left at a soggy Wrigley. \n\"Ever since that game I've kinda been battling with shoulder, I guess, tenderness and stuff,\" Wong said after the Cardinals' spring opening loss to Miami. \"Got a cortisone at the end of the season and tried to stay with my arm care. It wasn't getting better. So at the winter warmup I went to them and got an MRI. They just told me I need to clear some stuff up.\" \nWong did ask if he would require surgery. \nThe answer he got, \"Not yet.\" \nThe \"stuff\" he's had to clean up is ongoing inflammation in the right shoulder. He is also going through some exercises that are supposed to add stabilizing strength to the shoulder. He described how he aggravates the injury by jutting the shoulder forward and puts added stress on the muscles on the back of the shoulder. They need to be stronger to provide stability. \nThe initial injury happened Sept. 23, when the Cardinals started Wong in left field and he slipped and went face-first into the turf as he tried to play a ball. His shoulder got jarred when he hit the turf. \nWong expects to be in the lineup Sunday, and manager Mike Matheny said he has no lingering concern about his second baseman's shoulder. \n\"Keeping a closer eye\" on it, Matheny said. \nWong took full infield Saturday with his teammates and he did not limit his throwing. He did throw conservatively. He isn't hesitant to unleash at full-speed, but at his position he can ease into that. \n\"I think I can hide it,\" Wong said. \"Obviously there's going to be a little pain here and there. But I've played through pain my whole life so there's not going to be a difference. I took infield and it felt fine. We'll see what happens.\" \n-30-", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:54:05.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
