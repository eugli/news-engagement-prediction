There is no legal framework backing such development and members of the public will be prejudiced due to invasion of their privacy,\" said Omtatah. \nHe submitted that Broadband Communications Networks Limited, the company being used by CA to implement the directive, has no legal capacity to protect customer confidentiality and will illegally share people's information with Government authorities. \nOmtatah accused the CA of lying to Kenyans that the gadgets will only track fake equipment, arguing that there are existing laws being used by mobile network providers to detect fake phones. \nThe government on February 6 wrote to mobile telephone providers Safaricom Limited, Airtel Networks Limited and Orange-Telkom Kenya to allow the tapping of their computers by planting spying plant gadgets on all networks in the country. \nThe devices can access information stored by service providers and transacted on phone owned by individuals, including the times and dates of then communication, exact location of calls and duration of calls. \n\"There is already existing laws allowing the government to tap into a person phone through a court order. Although they claim the move is to track counterfeit devices, it is the Kenyans who will suffer by losing their privacy,\" swore Omtatah. \nHe added that the authority had violated the law by resorting to implement the directive secretly without involving key stakeholders and members of the public to give their views. \nHe said that is the move is allowed, the public will have no right to freedom of conscience, freedom of thought, belief and opinion. \nThe activist wants orders stopping implementation of the directive until the suit is heard and determined. The application was certified as urgent and set for hearing on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T17:33:15.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
