By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Published:February 21, 2017 10:30 pm Kamal Haasan, Subramanian Swamy. \nThe war of words between actor Kamal Haasan and BJP leader Subramanian Swamy shows no sign of abating with both sides hitting out at each other on Twitter over recent political developments in Tamil Nadu. Replying to a question from a user who asked him if the BJP would welcome Kamal to lead the crisis-hit state, Swamy said he would oppose any move by Haasan to venture into the politics. “I don’t know about BJP but I will oppose this boneless wonder and pompous idiot called Kamal Haasan,” he said. @satishrajaram5 : I don't know about BJP but I will oppose this boneless wonder and pompous idiot called Kamal Hasan \n— Subramanian Swamy (@Swamy39) February 20, 2017 \n“Kamal Haasan is a pompous idiot because he deliberately falsely twists that I said all Tamils are Porkis & opposed his entry into politics,” the BJP leader further said. \nIn response, Kamal said “I have one bone of contention. It’s good enough. Su. Sa called Tamils porikis. Glad I won’t have to oppose him. People will.” \nThe Tamil stalwart didn’t just stop there as he posted another tweet, saying “Wont retort with rudeness. His experience exceeds mine in acidic political exchanges. He might like his meal boneless.I don’t. Bon appetit sir.” Kamal’s responses were retweeted by over 2, 500 users. Wont retort with rudeness.His experience exceeds mine in acidic political exchanges.

Swamy, who has been very vocal against the pro-jallikattu protesters, had taken on Kamal after the actor said at the press meet that he thought the government should have met protesters. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:09:05.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
