Only 13 out of the 98 speakers over the two days are women. \nThe “Lass War” protest has been organised by the standup comedian and poet Kate Fox, who has made a comedy series for Radio 4 and been poet in residence for the Great North Run. Protesters have been encouraged to dress up and recreate classic “northern powerhouse” photographs: men in suits and ties signing things and looking proud, as well as men on construction sites pointing at things and looking important. \nIn November 2014, 11 men from Greater Manchester lined up to sign the first devolution agreement with the then chancellor, George Osborne. The photograph prompted widespread criticism, with organisers later explaining that Stockport’s Sue Derbyshire, then the region’s only female leader, was on holiday. \n“I think it makes the north look sexist and outdated,” Fox said of the lack of high-profile women. “Exactly the opposite of what is needed when the north needs to be pulled together into a future vision which inspires everybody. \n“There’s been a lot of interest in the protest and hopefully several of us can remind the delegates that there are actual women in the north that they need to take into account. It might also make them think about the messages they are sending out by having all these ridiculous pictures which are as man-heavy as Trump’s cabinet .” This photo sums up Trump’s assault on women’s rights | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett Read more \nOrganisers of the conference have acknowledged that women will be under-represented, and blamed firms for choosing to send men to speak. \nEmma Gill, a divorce lawyer from Vardags, who heads up an all-female office in Manchester , said: “It is so disappointing that such a focal event for the northern powerhouse seemingly excludes half of the population. \n“Event organisers, whilst acknowledging the lack of female speakers, simply shrug and blame the keynote companies for proposing the panel members. What does this tell us? Either there are too few females in top positions in these organisations or that the companies don’t think their top-flight women have something to add to the debate. \n“What is certain is the reality check provided for the region. The future of the northern economy depends on accessing core skills from across the workforce to really make it fire on all cylinders.” \nProtesters will gather outside the conference as delegates register from 8-8.30am on Tuesday, and again between 1-2pm. \nMeanwhile, Jo Miller and Donna Hall, the chief executives of Doncaster and Wigan councils respectively, are working on plans for an alternative “unconference”. \nTheir event, The People’s Powerhouse , is pencilled in for 9 May at Doncaster Rovers’ football ground.
