Dan Kitwood/Getty Images \nThis post from LinkedIn Influencer J.T. O'Donnell appeared originally on LinkedIn. \nMany good employers today are focused on hiring for 'cultural fit' within their company. And, for good reason. \nHiring the wrong person can cost a company thousands of dollars in training and productivity. \nLike it or not, humans form tribes â€” and the workplace is no exception. \nChoosing the right candidate for the job means making sure their personality and approach to the job will mesh with the existing team . That being said ... there are also bad employers. \nCompanies with toxic corporate cultures tend to have a hard time recruiting good talent. That's because news of a poor employer travels fast. Thanks to sites like Glassdoor, job seekers can do their homework and learn if a company is bad news. However, some companies get pretty good at hiding their toxic culture . Thus, it's up to the job seeker to dig deeper and look for the warning signals. 7 signs an employer has problems \nThe following seven signs can help you spot an employer with issues: They don't introduce you to the manager and when you ask about his or her management style, you're told they are, \"intense\" or \"eccentric.\" Nobody in the office is smiling or talking to each other and they actively avoid making eye contact with you. When you meet potential co-workers, they barely speak and say nothing about what it's like to work there. The job you are applying to has had four people in it in the last year. When you ask about the turnover in the position, the manager trash-talks about the former employees and their short-comings. When you ask a colleague to introduce you to someone who works there and she says the person isn't comfortable talking about their employer. When you ask about what they look for in a candidate, they say, \"Hard working, loyal, appreciative, and respectful.\" \nBeing a cultural fit for a company is an important part of finding success and satisfaction on the job. [This video explains more on why you should care a a lot about being a culture fit.] If the employer's culture is toxic, you'll drain your energy trying to cope. Remember, if a job offer seems too good to be true , it usually is. \nCompanies with bad work environments are known for offering hazard pay as a way to lure talent into their toxic world. Do your homework and think twice before taking a job with a company that has one or more of the warning signs above. MORE FROM J.T.
