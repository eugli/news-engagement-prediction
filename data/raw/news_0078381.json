Credit: momentsintime/AP \nThe car in which Tupac Shakur was fatally shot in has gone on sale for £1.2 million ($1.5 million). \nThe US rapper, whose hits include California Love and Changes, was killed in a drive-by attack in Las Vegas in September 1996. \nHe was taken to hospital and put on a life support machine, but died six days later at the age of 25. Tupac pictured three days before he was fatally shot in 1996.

The murder has never been solved. \nThe car listing doesn't give any details on its history since Shakur's death. \nBut it appears to have been well-used with more than 92,000 miles on the clock.
