You say 'He hasn't done this, he hasn't done that, he's not going to do all these things.' Give him a fucking chance, mate. Hitler didn't kill the Jews on the first day. He worked up to it.\" Meanwhile, Morgan has been taking a leaf from Trump's book and tweeting madly about the whole thing:\nHe burned himself. I heard him apologise to producers after the show for losing his temper. https://t.co/PHhSGDDLGZ\n— Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) February 11, 2017 No. When they play the Hitler card vs Trump, there's no point. https://t.co/AuT7P9eFiC\n— Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) February 11, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Everything I said was factual.\nIf you think screaming 'FUCK OFF!!!' at me changes that, then you're mistaken. https://t.co/0U9fVoTjfc\n— Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) February 11, 2017 And then it got even better when Harry Potter author/LEGIT REGAL QUEEN J.K. Rowling jumped into the mix. First, she tweeted about how satisfying it was to see Morgan told to fuck off on live TV:\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Yes, watching Piers Morgan being told to fuck off on live TV is *exactly* as satisfying as I'd always imagined. https://t.co/4FII8sYmIt\n— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 11, 2017 Morgan reacted by saying Rowling's tweet was why he never read the Harry Potter books. Which was a big mistake, because she came for him yet again (and did not miss)\nBecause you had a premonition that one day the author would roar with laughter at seeing you called out for your bullshit on live TV? https://t.co/8rkKSqJTnG\n— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 11, 2017 And then Morgan couldn't resist responding again to tell Rowling that everything he said on the panel was factual, and that's when she really dragged him:\n. @piersmorgan Would you like a couple of hours to mock up some pictures of refugees carrying explosives to substantiate your position? https://t.co/sFj0kqIajd\n— J.K.
