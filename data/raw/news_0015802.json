And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that.” \nAsked about Trump’s remarks Monday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said, “The president’s comments were very clear.” \nSpicer says Trump feels a “protest gets blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn’t necessarily get the same coverage.” \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
