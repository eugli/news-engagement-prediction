On the show, the Clippers vet called Green's trash-talk game \"light\" and essentially said that AAU has killed great trash talking. \nIn case you missed it, here's what Green yelled at Pierce during the game on Thursday night: \n\"Chasing that farewell tour, they don't love you like that. You can't get no farewell tour. They don't love you like that â€¦ You thought you was Kobe.\" \nA few days later, here's what Pierce said about Green on ABC: \n\"[Draymond Green's trash-talk game] is about a three. I've been around for a long time, the likes of Kevin Garnett, obviously. I grew up watching Gary Payton, hearing him, so that's light. I couldn't even hear him.\" \n(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) \n(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) \nNext, Pierce explained what really happened between him and Green: \n\"This is how it all started: Blake Griffin posted him up, got a foul, and I was pretty much like, 'You can't guard Blake. He gonna give it to you all night. You not that good. You only good because you got Steph Curry, KD and Klay Thompson around. That's the only reason you get recognition.' \n\"I'm trying to spark my team with the trash talk, go at their emotional leader and give my guys some confidence, and that's when you heard say what he said.\" \nWatch the video \nThen, Pierce said that trash talking is a dead art, and that's why what happened with him and Green is such a big deal. \nHe explained that the reason he believes it's dead is that kids nowadays grow up playing AAU basketball with their friends instead of battling outside on the playground. defpensports: Paul Pierce blames AAU for lack of trash talk ABC NBA Countdown https://t.co/j4xBmcUemw pic.twitter.com/krl7Uerhmp \nWhile Pierce may think that Green and the entire NBA's trash-talk game is weak, the Clippers lost to the Warriors in all four of their matchups this season.
