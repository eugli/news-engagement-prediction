There’s no doubt about that,” International Olympic Committee vice president John Coates told Around The Rings . \n“We wanted the venues to be used, to be a legacy for those [permanent arenas] that were to stay.” The outside cover of the Olympic Aquatic Stadium is falling off.

Private companies are steering clear of investing in the sites and the state budget is still recovering from exceeding estimated spending on the Games, leaving these sporting venues neglected. \n“It can happen because of the financial situation with the city council, and not having put in place companies to manage these venues afterwards. It’s local planning,” Coates said. \nOf the 17 new venues constructed for the Rio Games, 10 were meant to be repurposed for future use, however it remains to be seen when this will happen.

The historic stadium, site of the opening and closing ceremony, has been vandalised as stadium operators, the Rio state government, and Olympic organisers, have fought over $1 million in unpaid electricity bills and management of the venue.

In a deal with the city, billionaire developer Pasquale Mauro spent about $20 million to build the course in exchange for permission to construct the multimillion-dollar apartments on some of Rio's most desirable real estate.

Four of the new arenas in the main Olympic Park have failed to find a private-sector management, and ownership has passed to the federal government. Another new arena will be run by the cash-strapped city. AP Photo / Silvia Izquierdo. Source: AP Sign up for Sportsmail The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
