(Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Sunday, February 5, 2017, 11:59 PM \nThe New England Patriots' absurd Super Bowl LI victory was mere minutes old, but Robert Kraft wasn't wasting any time: he was going to rub it right in Roger Goodell's face right away. It being DeflateGate, of course. \nRight after Goodell handed Kraft the trophy, the Patriots owner -- who was being interviewed by Terry Bradshaw on stage -- got right to the point. \n\"Two years ago, we won our fourth Super Bowl down in Arizona and I told our fans that was the sweetest one of all. But a lot has transpired over the last two years,\" Kraft said, as the crowd, sensing where he was going, roared in response. \"And I don't think that needs any explanation. But I want to say to our fans, to our brilliant coaching staff, our amazing players who were so spectacular: this is unequivocally the sweetest.\" \nYou sure it's still not awkward, Roger? Robert Kraft took a not-so-subtle shot at Roger Goodell in his postgame speech... pic.twitter.com/lsLEN9RtGB â€” Sports Illustrated (@SInow) February 6, 2017 \nKraft has hardly hidden his displeasure throughout the two-plus year saga that resulted in the Patriots having two draft picks stripped from them and Tom Brady being suspended for the first four games of the 2016 season. But even Goodell's DeflateGate penalties were no match for Brady, Bill Belichick and Co. \n\"And I'm proud to say for the fifth time, 'We are all Patriots,'\" Kraft continued. \"And tonight, for the fifth time, the Patriots are world champions.\" \nIt's only going to get worse for Goodell. Because Brady was the MVP, he and Goodell will have a press conference together on Monday. Deflated footballs, and the quarterback's controversial suspension, might just come up. \nAnd after that, it still won't be over for Goodell. Since the commissioner has hid from Gillette Stadium since the infamous DeflateGate game in January of 2015, the tension has been building for his inevitable return. Kraft made a point of extending the invitation to Goodell to next year's season opener, so there's a good chance that will be a chance for the Foxborough faithful to tell the commissioner exactly what they think of him.
