Mayank Rawat (1) lasted for just 5 balls as he was caught by keeper Ollie Pope off as India were left struggling at 54-4.\nThen Radhakrishnan and keeper Het Patel steadied the innings and conjured a 47-run stand for the fifth wicket. However, Patel (23) was stumped by Pope off Delray Rawlins, while Shiva Singh was dismissed at 13 with the team score reading 137-6.\nWithout a run being added to the team score, Radhakrishnan was then caught by Harry Brook off Rawlins.\nUnlike the last game, it was an impressive show by English bowlers with Henry Brookes (3-30) emerging as the most successful one.\nEarlier, put into bat, both the English openers Hary Brook (14) and Tom Banton (16) fell cheaply.\nWhile Brook was caught behind by keeper Het Patel off pacer Ishan Porel, Banton was caught at first slip by S Radhakrishnan off pacer Yash Thakur.\nDangerman Delray Rawlins (17) also did not last long as the visitors were teetering at 64-3.\nOne down George Bartlett scored 47 (5 fours and 2 sixes), before being trapped in front of the wicket by left-arm spinner Shiva Singh.\nIn his first over, left-arm spinner Ayush Jamwal removed Max Holden (3) after he was brilliantly caught in the slips by Radhakrishnan as half of the English side went back to the pavilion with the team score of 121-5.\nWicket keeper Ollie Pope and Will Jacks then rallied the innings by sharing a 55-run stand in 66 balls. They hit the bad balls and rotated the strike taking England colts to 176. As they were inching ahead, Jacks (28) threw his wicket after being stumped by Het off Mayank Rawat.\nIn the 41st over, Jamwal cleaned up Pope (47) with England now at 182-7. However, a 14-run last over helped the visitors reach 226/9. For the hosts, Jamwal was the most successful bowler with figures of 3-40.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:40:42.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
