Now get ready to fall head over heels for the New York Sullivans! \"Drake Sullivan is swoon worthy!\" ~ Blender on Goodreads \"I absolutely loved this book.

Bella did it again, making us fall in love with the entire Sullivan family all over again.\" ~ My Girlfriend's Couch Blog BOOK DESCRIPTION: World-renowned artist Drake Sullivan doesn’t paint women. Ever. Not when he knows all too well just how destructive painter/muse relationships can be. But on the day Rosa Bouchard walks onto the cliffs outside his Montauk cottage, Drake is so captivated that he can’t stop himself from bringing her to life on canvas. Shocked and horrified by the nude photos of her that have just hit the Internet, reality TV star Rosa’s every instinct is to run from her Miami home and hide. After driving all night, she ends up in Montauk, New York, where she doesn’t know a soul and plans to lie low until she can figure out how to deal with the media firestorm—and her own mother, who seems all too happy to sell out Rosa’s happiness for more fame, more fans, and more money. The very last thing Rosa expects is to find, and to fall for, a sinfully sexy man like Drake Sullivan. Drake has never felt this way about anything he’s painted...and he’s definitely never felt this way about a woman. When they kiss, everything but sweet, breathless desire melts away. But can he convince Rosa to trust—and to love—again after such a devastating betrayal? \"Not since Nora Roberts has anyone been able to write a big family romance series with every book as good as the last.
