This is such a stark reminder of how quickly an accident can happen and lives shattered in the process.\"Â \nDisturbed posted a similar tribute, saying that the \"horror and heartbreak felt by everyone on the tour is beyond words.\" Read the band's full tribute below: \nNo other details on the incident were available at press time and spokespeople for the groups could not be reached for further comment. Avenged Sevenfold, Disturbed and Chevelle were slated to perform in Milan, Italy, on Tuesday (Feb. 21), but the show was canceled due to what the promoter said was an illness affecting Avenged singer M. Shadows. \nÂ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:49:09.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
