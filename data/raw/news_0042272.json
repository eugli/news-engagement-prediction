Craig Keane, 28, lifted a sleeping boy's pyjamas and touched him eight times in the early hours of the morning on October 2 last year. He was caught by a hidden camera which had been planted by another child who was concerned by the former special constable's actions. Keane, from Wickford, pleaded guilty to a total of nine counts of sexual assault committed between 12.37am and 12.39am and between 12.43am and 1.40am on the same day. Keane, a design teacher at The Sandon School, in Chelmsford, Essex, now faces jail. He had also volunteered for the Metropolitan Police, where he helped categorise indecent images of children. He has been suspended from both his roles as a teacher and special constable. Heather Oliver, defending said: 'He is a man of previous good character and even of positive character.' Judge Alastair Hammerton said: 'Although I have extended your bail I'm not giving an indication as to which way I or another judge will sentence you in March.' Keane will be sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court on March 20.
