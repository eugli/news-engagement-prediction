She oversaw a significant streamlining of the organisation. \nClark was a contender to become secretary-general of the UN, when António Guterres won the post last year. UN insiders say Guterres backs Miliband for the $170,000 (£135,000) a year role. \nThe former foreign secretary would be unlikely to secure the post without the backing of the UK government. A Whitehall source confirmed to the Guardian that Miliband had signalled that he was keen to take on the job. \nA spokesman for the IRC said Miliband would not comment on rumours about his future. \nThe two Miliband brothers played out their sibling rivalry in public when both stood for the Labour leadership. David Miliband stepped down from parliament and began a new life on the other side of the Atlantic rather than serve in his younger brother’s frontbench team. \nSince Labour suffered a humiliating defeat at the 2015 general election, and while it continues to languish in the polls, some of Jeremy Corbyn’s fiercest critics continue to suggest Labour members picked “the wrong Miliband”, and rumours periodically surface about the possible return of Ed’s elder brother. \nDavid Miliband has been a trenchant critic of Donald Trump’s executive order on refugees in recent days, telling the Guardian it threatened the west’s reputation for compassion. “When you meet families that are being torn apart by this ban, that causes doubt about what our countries stand for, and that is one of the most dangerous aspects of this.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T16:03:33.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
