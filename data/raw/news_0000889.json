Article continues below \nFailing to get himself on the scoresheet appeared to frustrate Martial yet two assists in a 4-0 victory shouldn't be sniffed at. \nBut what did Jose Mourinho make of the Frenchman's performance? Article continues below Twitter goes crazy after Suarez's incredible solo goal for Barca vs Atleti \nSpeaking before of the game, Mourinho explained how Martial would earn a starting role against Hull City this weekend if he was \"magnificent\" against Wigan. \nAsked how the winger dealt with being dropped for the Stoke City game last week, he said : \"I don't speak with the players about how they take it. \n\"He will play Sunday and if he plays magnificent, he will play against Hull City in the next match. It's simple.\" \nAnd so, in Mourinho's latest press conference, the Portuguese was asked whether Martial had done enough to warrant a starting role. \nBut rather than say yes, he gave a rather brutal response. \n\"Enough to be on the bench,\" he said , bluntly. \"He has to perform better than the others who are competing for the same positions. \n\"His position is one where we have lots of options. Do you want me to leave Mkhitaryan out after being man of the match and playing so well as he did? I can't. \n\"The players pick themselves. I am just there to analyse what they do and try to be fair with them. Such a good performance, Mkhitaryan has to play. Simple.\" \nMkhitaryan was similarly brilliant against Wigan, but considering Martial bagged two assists, Mourinho's decision to drop him shouldn't be so clear cut. \nPlayers of Martial's age need game time and confidence to hit top form, which he isn't currently getting at United. \nInstead, the former Monaco prodigy is being given one game to impress and if he isn't up to Mourinho's high standards, he's immediately dropped. \nTalk about poor man management. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
