But the sustainability of the fledgling peace deal was further thrown into doubt by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who effectively withdrew from the Minsk agreement by signing an executive order which will recognize travel documents issued by the de facto separatist authorities in the region, it said in a statement .

Ukraine's Secretary of National Security and Defense, Oleksandr Turchynov, said Saturday that the order was the death-knell for the beleaguered Minsk agreement, the framework for peace in the region since pro-Russian militants occupied areas of eastern Ukraine in 2014.

The move by the Kremlin \"completely negates the Minsk process and states Russia's exit,\" he said Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko slammed Putin's order. \"For me, it is another evidence of Russian occupation and violation of international law. It is very symbolic and cynical that it happened during the Munich Security Conference,\" he said in a statement, referring to a meeting of high-level European and American officials in Germany last week.

Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Secretary-General Lamberto Zannier said in an interview that Putin's executive order would hurt the chances of the ceasefire to take hold. \"The steps taken last night by Russia to recognize these documents are making implementation (of the ceasefire) more difficult,\" he told Radio Free Europe .

MUST WATCH \nWhy is there conflict in Ukraine? 01:40 Vice-President Mike Pence sought to reassure European allies as to the US' commitment to NATO and other administration officials' insistence that the lifting of sanctions against Russia are tied to Russia's withdrawal from Crimea. Speaking during a security summit in Germany, where leaders are eagerly looking for clues about how the new US administration will broach Russia's persistent challenges to international law, Pence told world leaders Saturday that the United States will stand firm against Moscow while also seeking avenues for cooperation. \"Know this: the United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground, which as you know, President Trump believes can be found,\" Pence said during remarks at the Munich Security Conference, the first major foreign policy address of the Trump administration. But his trip to Munich last week coincides with widespread mistrust of the new US administration in Europe. The continent's leaders are eying Trump with skepticism -- few believed he could win November's election and made little attempt to mask their disregard for the billionaire real estate developer as he plodded forward with his unorthodox campaign. The frenetic first month of Trump's presidency has only deepened European leaders' concerns. Michael Flynn's resignation this week led to some optimism among Western diplomats who had been chagrined about the former national security adviser's desire to establish closer ties to Moscow. But widespread uncertainty about what steps Trump may take to begin cooperating with Russian President Vladimir Putin remains. Outspoken Russian lawmaker Alexey Pushkov weighed in Sunday, interpreting the executive order as a response to the tough words that US Vice President Mike Pence and US Secretary of Defense James Mattis have had for Russia in recent days. \"With the recognition of passports to Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples Republics, Moscow lets everybody know that pressure on the Ukrainian question (the speech by VP Pence in Munich) won't give any results,\" Pushkov tweeted.
