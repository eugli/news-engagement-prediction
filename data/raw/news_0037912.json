REUTERS/Ints Kalnins \nEstonia's President Kersti Kaljulaid has backed US President Donald Trump on NATO. \nShe told German newspaper Die Welt that she agreed with the Trump administration's expectation that European countries need to spend more on their defence budget. \nDefence Secretary James Mattis reportedly told NATO members on Wednesday that if they do not increase their defence spending, the US will step back from the alliance. \n\"If your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to this alliance, each of your capitals needs to show support for our common defence,\" he said in a speech in Brussels. \nKaljulaid said this was not an unrealistic demand. \"There is the legitimate expectation of the Americans that the Europeans spend more money on defence,\" she told Die Welt. \nFollowing pressure from the US in 2014, NATO partners set themselves the goal of increasing their defence spending to at least 2% of their gross domestic product (GDP) within a decade. Only five nations currently meet NATO's spending requirements, the US, the UK, Greece, Poland, and Estonia. \nOn Thursday, Mattis praised these countries for \"leading by example.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T19:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T15:37:45.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
