And after a meeting in rural Wisconsin a day earlier, Perez earned the backing of state Sen. Janet Bewley, a DNC committeewoman from the Badger state.

But like most of the high-profile figures who have endorsed in this peculiar race, she doesn't actually have a vote. \nWhat she could do was organize a meeting for Perez with about 20 of the state's Democratic officials, including the leaders of both chambers of the state legislature and several county chairmen. On the second floor of the headquarters of the state's teacher union, they munched on coffee, muffins and juice that Sebelius had provided while they discussed the plight of rural Democrats. \nThat goal, to rebuild the party outside major cities and blue states, will be much harder for Perez to accomplish, even if he wins the party's election. \nDemocrats have been decimated in rural areas across the country , a phenomenon that has meant a slow-moving death sentence for the party in an electoral system where controlling broad geographic territory is just as important as winning votes. \n\"We frankly have a crisis of confidence and crisis of relevance in the party right now,\" Perez told the group, which gathered around tables arranged a u-shape. \"We've lost touch with a lot of voters.\" \nPerez called for a \"culture change\" inside the party, noting that the party has to be physically present in rural areas and that it can often come across as condescending. \n\"We ignored people,\" Perez continued. \"And it's not just that people felt ignored, it's that people felt affirmatively disrespected and looked down on.\" \nRelated: In DNC Race, Ellison Opts for Bridge Building over Bomb Throwing \nPerez, a career civil rights lawyer from a wealthy Washington suburb who spent years working in the federal government, is not an obvious ambassador to rural America. But then again, neither are most of Democrats' prominent national leaders. \nAt a time when Democrats are emphasizing the need to win back white working class men, none of the party's seven leading candidates for chairman is a straight white male. \n\"If I asked my volunteers to use an iPad, they'd think I was talking about a hygiene product,\" Kenny Riffel, the chairman of the Democratic Party in rural Dickinson County, told Perezof his elderly volunteer base. \nBut in an interview after the event, Perez said he's convinced Democrats can win back rural territory — or at least cut their losing margin in meaningful ways — by focusing on a core message of economic empowerment. \n\"Our message has been muddled, especially in 2016. Voters in Ohio heard from Trump, 'I'm going to save your coal jobs.' And while that was a lie, what it told them is, 'I'm going to feel your pain,'\" Perez said. \"What they heard from the Democratic side was, 'Vote for us because Donald Trump is crazy.' I happen to think Donald Trump is crazy, but that's not an economic message.\" \nIn his controversial 2004 best-selling book, \"What's the Matter with Kansas,\" Thomas Frank argued that Democrats were losing the white working class over divisive social issues like abortion and gun control, which conservative economic elites had successfully used to drive a wedge between those voters and the Democratic Party.
