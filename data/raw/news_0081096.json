Little did they know that die-hard fans of the superstar would go so far — literally — and create trouble on set. As the crowd surged to catch a glimpse of their matinee idol, the makers were forced to cancel shoot. \n\nA source from the production unit says, \"We were shooting at Kaushal Bajpai house in a village called Bamrauli Katara near Agra on Thursday. It was a night shoot and we had more than adequate security in place. Apart from Sanjay sir's bodyguards, the state police force had deployed their men on location.\"\n\nHowever, as word about Dutt shooting there got out, fans from neighbouring villages gathered around the set to meet him. \"We didn't realise when the crowd wildly multiplied, with some turning unruly. It wasn't safe for Sanjay sir to come out for the shoot. Aditi (Rao Hydari, who plays his daughter) was also part of the scene. We waited for hours for the crowd to thin out before calling off the shoot.\"\n\nThe crowd on set \n\nDirector Omung Kumar confirms the news, adding, \"We were all set to roll, but thousands of people just took over our set. We couldn't manage the crowd; it was impossible to shoot that night. It was in the best interest of everyone to cancel it.\"\n\nThe scene, we hear, will be shot later this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:16:21.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
