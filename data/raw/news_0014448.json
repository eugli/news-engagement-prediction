Plus, once you buy an antenna you get great, uncompressed HD programming without a monthly fee. \nWe've done a guide on HDTV antennas before , but this model from 1byone deserves a shout out for being a really good value for the money. It has the same range as the newer model of our previous top-pick , but it's less than half the price. \nRange is the most important metric to consider when buying an HDTV antenna, because it has a direct impact on how many channels you'll be able to get. The point is to get as many channels as possible since this is probably your only source of live TV. HD antennas in this price range typically have a 25-mile radius. The only other outlier is Monoprice, whose antenna does have a 35-mile radius , but is still a few dollars more expensive. \nWhile I love my HD antenna, one thing to keep in mind is you'll only get the over-the-air channels available in your area. So before buying an antenna you should consult AntennaWeb or TVFool ; both websites let you punch in your address and see which channels you should be able to get. Living in a city, I was able to get a bunch of channels without a super powerful antenna â€” your case may be different. \nIf you're a total TV lover, an HD antenna probably won't replace your cable subscription. But if your favorite shows are all on ABC, CBS, NBC or Fox, this is a great way to keep up with your shows and save money each month. \n1byone 35-Mile Super Thin HDTV Antenna, $17.99, available at Amazon \nThis article was originally published on 8/31/2016.
