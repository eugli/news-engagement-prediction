The Team Penske namesake emphasized the special nature of the long-term and global business-to-business partnership and especially the example his team has set for the sport in its affiliation with Shell/Pennzoil. \"It gave us a chance to combine the business side and also we've used motorsports as a common thread,\" Penske said. \"We're trying to create some value of competitiveness in our business. \"For us to say we have a partnership with Shell beyond 2022 is massive for us, not just here but across the business. We've got Joey Logano for the same period and we have Todd Gordon, we think this is one of the biggest announcements in motorsports today. When you talk about the health of the sport, we consider this a watershed time.\" \"This is 30-plus races per year,\" Penske continued. \"We're not going to be changing the logos on the car every other week. This isn't just an announcement about a sponsor, it's about a business relationship … quite honestly it's the foundation of our whole business.\" Logano was equally as enthused about this opportunity, acknowledging both the rarity of such a long-term contract and the promise the move makes. \"It's an amazing honor and opportunity for me,\" Logano said. \"Obviously signing with Team Penske is a huge change in my career. I've learned to surround myself with greatness, people 'smarter than you.' When you think about 22 team and how close we’'ve grown together -- it's a huge advantage for us as a race team to keep the continuity. \"I'm very fortunate and exited about this. This was one of those decisions that was a no-brainer. A lot of pressure comes along with this. … I love pressure. Pressure is a privilege and it honestly is a privilege to have this opportunity to race for Roger Penske and Shell and Pennzoil. \"(The) fact it all goes together is unheard of. It's a very positive story in our sport to see the commitment of Shell and Pennzoil. It really sets a statement for not only Team Penske but NASCAR as a sport.\" \n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:35:08.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
