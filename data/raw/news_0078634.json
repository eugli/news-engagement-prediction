Additional information will be released about the flight teams, contingent upon their approval and confirmation of the health and fitness test results,\" Musk said. \nThe tourists will ride aboard the California-based company's Crew Dragon capsule, which is scheduled for its first unmanned test flight later this year. \nIt is based on the design currently used to send cargo to the International Space Station, with upgrades to allow for human transport. \nThe capsule will launch atop SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket, which is scheduled for its first test flight this summer. \nThe rocket \"will be the most powerful vehicle to reach orbit after the Saturn V moon rocket,\" Musk said. \n\"At five million pounds of liftoff thrust, Falcon Heavy is two-thirds the thrust of Saturn V and more than double the thrust of the next largest launch vehicle currently flying.\" Join the conversation! \n24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24 .
