CLASS OF 2017 \nBut he can finally say that the wait is over as he’ll be gracing the stage just two nights before WrestleMania 33, and this time, he’s the one that’ll be honoured for the work he’s done.

Article continues below \nDespite that, Page went on to become one of the most lovable stars in WCW history, competing in some big feuds and reaped the rewards that came with it too. THE PEOPLE'S CHAMPION \nWhile he found success as a villain in WCW, he finally broke out on to a much larger scale after he turned down a spot in the nWo. \nFans embraced him after making that bold move and years of hard work eventually paid off at Spring Stampede in 1999 after he defeated Sting, Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair to capture his first WCW World Championship. \nDDP went on to claim the gold on two more occasions before WCW was eventually bought by Vince McMahon’s WWE back in 2001, and even enjoyed a positive run as the European Champion. \nWith a decorated in-ring career behind him, Page continues to show why he’s deserving of a spot by helping people all over the world with his DDP Yoga programme. \nHe also used that to help his mentors and friends, Jake Roberts and Scott Hall, by moving them into his home and getting them into better shape and health, something they’ve both publicly claimed they’re thankful for. \nWhat do you make of DDP finally being inducted into the Hall of Fame?
