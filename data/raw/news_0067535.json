George broke his silence earlier this month on becoming a first time father, telling French news outlet Rencontres de Cinema, “We are really happy and really excited. It's going to be an adventure,\" adding, \"We've sort of embraced it all… with arms wide open.\" However the actor recently admitted to Paris Match that he is a bit anxious about welcoming two babies . “How can we not be anxious about this immense responsibility?” he confessed. “Bringing a child into this world … even two! We are very happy, very excited, but also a bit nervous, it’s normal.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:04:09.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
