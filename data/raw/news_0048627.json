The jury found that he had deliberately concealed his negotiations with businessman Bill Wong Cho-bau over a Shenzhen penthouse while the Executive Council discussed and eventually granted various applications, including one for a digital broadcasting licence, by radio station Wave Media, of which Wong was a shareholder. \nBut even after 20 hours of deliberation, the jury of eight men and one woman remained too split to return a verdict on another charge – a chief executive accepting an advantage – whereby Tsang is accused of accepting a free refurbishment, worth HK$3.35 million, for the penthouse as a reward for granting the applications. \nArriving at court on Monday morning, Tsang and his wife, Selina Tsang Pou Siu-mei, were greeted by over 100 jostling photographers and journalists. The couple stayed silent as they moved through the crowd. \nWearing a grim expression, the former chief executive did not answer reporters’ questions, though he coughed several times. \nEight bodyguards in dark suits met the Tsangs and helped them through the crowd, forming a circle around them as they stood in the foyer waiting for a lift. \nA member of the public repeatedly yelled “respect his family” in Cantonese. \nMembers of the media were particularly pushy as the couple arrived, with a handful of photographers spilling through the sliding door and continuing to take photos from within the courthouse foyer, which is against court rules. \nThe public gallery in the courtroom was so packed that some people were forced to stand, despite 156 seats being allocated for the public and the media. \nTsang’s former justice minister Wong Yan-lung SC made a surprise visit and went into a consultation room to greet his ex-boss. \nFormer Democratic Party chairman Albert Ho Chun-yan turned up to pass on a mitigation letter, signed by more than 10 Democratic Party members, including former lawmakers, to Tsang’s lawyers. \n“He has made a significant contribution to Hong Kong,” Ho said, citing Tsang’s success in tackling the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003. \nHe revealed that Martin Lee, founder of the Democratic Party and senior counsel, also wrote Tsang a separate letter. \nEarlier in the trial, the court had heard that Tsang had intended to stay in the three-storey penthouse after he retired in 2012. \n“Tailor made” for the former leader and his wife, the apartment was owned by Wong’s companies, which also paid for the refurbishment of the 6,700 sq ft property. \nThe defence claimed Tsang paid 800,000 yuan (HK$905,000) in 2010 as rent for the penthouse at the market rate, contending that it was a normal commercial lease. \nThe prosecutors said, however, that this was a secret deal for Tsang to purchase the property at an undervalued price, or “a licence to occupy” it for as long as he wanted. \nThe prosecution portrayed Tsang as a two-faced liar and the protagonist in “a story of greed”, who had used his public position to collude with rich businessmen for personal gain. \nThe defence claimed he was a “straightforward” man who had given 45 years of unbroken service to Hong Kong and had no reason to ruin his “glittering” career by accepting a bribe. \nTsang faced a third charge of misconduct in public office, alleging that he had put forward interior designer Barrie Ho Chow-lai for an honour under the city’s award system without revealing to government bodies that Ho was engaged in design work for the penthouse. \nHe was acquitted unanimously on this count.
