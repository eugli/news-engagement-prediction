Evanger's Dog & Cat Food is now issuing a voluntary recall for some cans of its most popular product, Hunk of Beef. Pentobarbital can cause drowsiness, dizziness, nausea and sometimes death once ingested. The drug was found in one dog's stomach, and in one lot of the food after further testing. Evanger's has since stopped using the meat supplier connected to the product and is urging consumers to check their cans. The affected food is marked with lot numbers starting with 1816E03HB, 1816E04HB, 1816E06HB, 1816E07HB and 1816E13HB, as well as the expiration date June 2020. It was distributed to retail and online stores in the following states: Washington, California, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. Customers can return the cans for a full refund at the place of purchase. \"Hunk of Beef is our #1 seller. Pets consume over one million cans of Hunk of Beef per year.\" Evanger's wrote on its website . \"This beef supplier provides us with beef chunks from cows that are slaughtered in a USDA facility. We continue to investigate how this substance entered our raw material supply.\" While the recall may only affect a few batches, it's important to double-check what you and your friends' pets are eating. When the potential risk is this high, it's better to be safe than sorry.
