Gondar village in the Kedarnath constituency of Rudraprayag district saw a complete overhaul in the 2017 assembly elections with the efforts of the district administration and election officials. \n\nSpeaking to TOI, district election officer who is also the Rudraprayag district magistrate, Ranjana (who goes by her first name) she said, \"Imagine a village where there was zero percent voting in the past, this time over 70 percent turned up to exercise their voting right. We had tried to motivate the villagers here since a long time.\" \n\nAdding to which, she said, \"There are 183 voters in this Gondar village which has the farthest polling booth in the constituency and we are happy that we could encourage so many of them to vote, in contrast to earlier elections. This just shows that dedicated efforts could bring in the change and make people understand the importance of voting\" \n\nIt is learnt that efforts by DEO, DM Ranjana and her team of election officials in this constituency were also made to ensure that more differently-abled voters come forward to vote. \n\nIn fact, special doli's of NCC cadets were sent to homes to fetch 232 voters who were severely disabled and could not come to the polling booths.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:59:20.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
