(WatchESPN screen shot) More The most remarkable shot of the weekend won’t show up in a box score.\nWith his team leading host Detroit by eight in the closing seconds of the first half on Sunday afternoon, Valparaiso guard Micah Bradford hoisted a three-quarters-court heave just before time expired. The ball hit the edge of the shot clock, caromed high in the air and somehow, someway fell through the rim.\nThis shot didn't count … but WHAT? How? ???? pic.twitter.com/i7ZfPY8t25\n— ESPN College BBall (@ESPNCBB) February 19, 2017\nReferees were correct to waive off the basket even though it appears Bradford got the shot off in time. The shot clock is considered out of bounds, meaning that the play was over as soon as the ball made contact with it.\nIn reality, Valparaiso didn’t need the basket anyway. The Crusaders cruised to an 83-63 road victory to maintain sole possession of first place in the Horizon League, 1.5 games ahead of second-place Oakland.\n– – – – – – –\nJeff Eisenberg is the editor of The Dagger on Yahoo Sports.
