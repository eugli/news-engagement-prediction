Noncompliant schools risked losing federal education funding. \nTwelve states filed a lawsuit challenging that interpretation of Title IX, the federal statute barring discrimination in education on the basis of “sex.” A federal court in Texas blocked the order nationwide in August. \nThe Obama administration filed an appeal challenging that ruling, but it was withdrawn this month by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \nGay-rights organizations say rescinding the order will harm transgender students. \n“Transgender young people face tragically high rates of discrimination and bullying, and they need a government that will stand up for them — not attack them,” Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said in a statement. “It’s shocking that this kind of harm would even be a subject of debate for the president. We call on Trump to immediately and permanently affirm the Obama Administration’s guidance and protect transgender students.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:52:36.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
