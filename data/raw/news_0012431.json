If we had won them the situation would have been totally different,' Ibrahimovic said.\n'We are working hard and we really want to reach the top four and the Champions League. To be champions it will be hard but this is our aim and we don't give up.\n'I think we are back in the hunt. It was a big gap couple of months ago but it is smaller now.\n'We have been our own enemy. If we had won our games and got the points we should have got the situation would have been totally different.\n'But okay, now we look at other teams and hope they lose points.'\nChris Smalling, who captained United at Leicester, added: 'I think we've had a few opportunities to be able to close that gap and I think today we've taken that opportunity and played well.

We have some games left so hopefully I will get more.\nThe Swedish forward celebrates with team-mate Henrikh Mkhitaryan after scoring his goal\n'I have a target in my head but I will not say it! I am not there yet. But I have a target and it is something I have been doing never year and it is nothing new for me. I keep producing. I have 20 goals and seven assists. The statistic is in reach like it has been before in other years, except for last year which was a crazy year!'\nIbrahimovic scored 50 goals for Paris Saint-Germain last season.\nHe added: 'Everything motivates me, all the targets, all the other critics, all the atmosphere coming to Premier League and bringing more followers to the Premier League.
