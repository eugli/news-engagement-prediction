Full of calming blues and grays the palate is serene and the furniture provides pops of color and the art ads some funky style. \nFrom Elena : My husband and I were on a house hunt about two years ago when we stumbled across this 1998 ranch. This three bedroom, two bath house had not been touched since the late '90s (hence the floral borders, Kelly green counter tops, and wall-to-wall pinkish taupe?). I found instant potential in this home. Structurally this house was in pristine condition, cosmetically speaking, it was a different story. We tirelessly renovated each room in our new abode. The walls now are painted in grays and blues, which are complimented by the recently painted white trim. Anchoring the space throughout are dark bamboo floors, creating a cohesive and consistent look. \nI guess you could say my decorating style is eclectic with inspirations of Mid-century modern. We kept the renovation choices simple in order to have more fun with furnishings and artwork. With my husband and I both being creative types, we have accumulated a large collection of original art. We absolutely love these pieces and try to treat the walls of our home more like an art gallery rather than a house in suburban Kansas. Our artwork and furnishings coexist, playing off one another with vibrant colors and dynamic shapes. While there are new items of furniture scattered around our house, the vintage pieces have my heart. \nWe have throughly enjoyed taking this once cookie cutter home and infusing it with our personal style of vintage finds and custom artworks. \nThanks, Elena ! \n• Interested in sharing your home with Apartment Therapy?
