(Google) Reprints \nGoogle YouTube will stop running unskippable 30-second ads as of 2018, the Alphabet ( GOOGL ) unit said on Friday. \n\"We've decided to stop supporting 30-second unskippable ads as of 2018 and focus instead on formats that work well for both users and advertisers,\" Google said in a statement. \nAlphabet will still allow 20-second unskippable ads as well as the six-second ads introduced last April. \nThat comes after Facebook ( FB ) recently announced that it would bar pre-roll ads, meaning that Facebook will soon only allow mid-roll ads. CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees Facebook's future in video, and any effort to improve the user experience will help. \nAlphabet's Google also has said that skippable ads deliver strong engagement . \nWith unskippable ads, users may simply click to another page, or switch to another tab while the marketing airs. With skippable ads, users may pay attention for the first five seconds before they can skip. That's decent engagement, and many users may stick around for the full around once they've gotten started.
