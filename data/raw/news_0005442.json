In November, Nordstrom posted a response on Twitter to a shopper’s letter calling for the company to stop selling the brand, saying, ‘‘We hope that offering a vendor’s products isn’t misunderstood as us taking a political position; we’re not.’’\nA Nordstrom spokesperson didn’t say whether the decision to stop buying the brand was permanent, only that they make buying decisions each season. Nordstrom also said it offers thousands of brands and cuts about 10 percent each year based performance.\nThe Ivanka Trump brand was no longer listed on the company’s website Thursday evening, and a search of her products on the site turned up just a few pairs of shoes, all of which had been marked down in price.\n‘‘I am absolutely thrilled, and I know the vast majority of Grab Your Wallet participants will be as well,’’ said Shannon Coulter, a co-founder of Grab Your Wallet.\nIvanka Trump’s independent lifestyle brand promotes her image as a successful working mother and partners with companies to make the branded blush pink dresses and trendy booties offered in multiple department stores.\nHer business has also come under fire after she appeared on CBS’ ‘‘60 Minutes’’ wearing a nearly $11,000 gold bracelet from her jewelry line and someone from the company sent photos from the interview, seeking free publicity.\nShe said on Facebook in January she would take a formal leave of absence from her brand and from the Trump Organization but said she was confident both businesses would continue to thrive.\n___\nInformation from: The Seattle Times, http://www.seattletimes.com", "external_links": ["https://goo.gl/lPk2F5"], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:23:09.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
