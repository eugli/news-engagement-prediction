Hamara gathbandhan UP ki bhavishya ka aaena hai.\" By: FE Online | Saharanpur | Updated: February 5, 2017 4:11 PM Rahul Gandhi in Saharanpur on Sunday. (ANI) \nContinuing his poll campaign in the state’s major city of Saharanpur, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi today addressed yet another rally and played up the potential of the alliance with the Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav -led Samajwadi Party. The duo has been addressing a number of gatherings during their roadshows in their campaign and has sought to dispel all doubts about their respective parties playing second-fiddle to PM Narendra Modi ’s Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) or even to Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). They have both also downplayed the harsh words that they had used to describe each other in the run-up to the elections till the tie-up was announced. \nSpeaking today in the region that is marked by the presence of a large Muslim population, Rahul Gandhi took to ‘shayari’ to appeal to the gathering there and proceeded to talk up the ‘gahtbandhan’ by saying, “Main Hindi aur Urdu ka doaab hun, Main wo aaena hun jisme aap hain’. Hamara gathbandhan UP ki bhavishya ka aaena hai.” \nUsing the name of a famous Urdu poet, he explained the need for the Congress-Samajwadi tie-up by saying, “Firaq Gorakhpuri ki shabdon mein –‘Hum dono mein farak hai bas itna, Ek kehta hai khawaab, ek kehta hai sapna’. \nYou May Also Like To Watch: \nGandhi urged the people of UP to leave BJP behind like people of Bihar had done in 2016 elections. “Hum chahte hain jaise Bihar se Modi ji ko vapis bheja tha vaise hi UP se bhi vapis bhej dein. Isliye ab vo Bihar ki baat nahi karte,” he said. Gandhi took a jibe at Modi’s dressing sense saying that Modi stopped wearing suit-boot after he had commented curtly on his style in Parl. “Modi Ji pehle suit pehente the, humne Parl mein suit-boot ki sarkar pe bhashan diya to unhone suit pehenna chhor diya, said Gandhi.
