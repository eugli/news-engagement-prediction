Getty By Charles P. Pierce Feb 21, 2017 OK, we're going to mention Mr. Milo just once more, but there's an excuse because it involves Scott Walker, the goggle-eyed homunculus hired by Koch Industries to run their Midwest subsidiary formerly known as the state of Wisconsin. Because he has no shame, and because his primary goal is to drain anything that's left of Wisconsin's proud progressive traditions, Walker has an entirely new riff to run on the state. From The Capital Times : \nIn his 2017-2019 executive budget, Walker recommends \"codifying the state's commitment to academic freedom,\" and providing $10,000 in funding for the UW System to review and revise \"policies related to academic freedom.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Wait for it. \nThe UW Board of Regents and each college campus \"shall guarantee all members of the system's community the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge and learn.\" \n\"It is not the proper role of the board or any institution or college campus to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply offensive.\" \nMembers of the system's community are free to criticize and contest views expressed on campus and \"speakers who are invited to express their views, (but) they may not obstruct or otherwise interfere with the freedom of others to express views they reject or even loathe.\" \nThe board and each institution and college campus has a responsibility not only to promote a lively and fearless freedom of debate and deliberation, but also to protect that freedom when others attempt to restrict it.\" Most Popular No, seriously. Wait for it. \nWisconsin is not the only state seeing proposed legislation that purports to seek to protect free speech on campus. In Tennessee, a proposed law requiring that colleges punish students who interfere with the free expression of others has been dubbed the Milo Bill , for alt-right provocateur and Breitbart News editor Milo Ylannopolos. In a December talk at UW-Milwaukee, Yiannopolos targeted a transgender student by name from the stage, prompting condemnation from Chancellor Mark Mone. Timing is everything.
