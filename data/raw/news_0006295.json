She’s good, man. Her spirits are good. She’s doing her thing. In the conversation that I had with her, If I had to say right here, right now – and, again, I don’t like saying right here, right now, [because] it’s up to her and [it’s] her thing – but I wouldn’t say she fights again.

She’s going to ride off into the sunset and start living her life outside of fighting.” \nWe'll have to wait until we get some sort of official confirmation from Rousey herself in order to call it a day on her MMA career, but if it is true, then she’ll retire with a 12-2 overall MMA record, including being 6-2 in the UFC. \nEveryone could recognize how the former UFC Women's Bantamweight champion changed mentally following her first UFC loss against Holm over a year ago. It's why it took her so long for her to return, only to be defeated once more. \nAfter everything she has managed to achieve in the world, there isn't a need for her to continue unless she wants to. She has left her mark on the world and ultimately changed the perspective on women's combat sports for the better. \nWhite said: “I’m happy for her, man. She came in, she changed the world. She put female fighting on the map. She’s been part of the biggest fights in the history of women’s fighting, and I hope those records can be broken. I don’t know if they can, but I hope they can.” \nNow we'll just have to wait for Rousey to respond to these comments for an official announcement on her future to see if it truly is an end of an era for women's fighting. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
