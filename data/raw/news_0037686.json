Audu Maikori released \nThough the officer who confirmed the news declined to disclose the exact department that made the arrest, he however said the Police has a duty to ensure investigation of allegations and petitions made by Nigerians especially one that is capable to threatening peace and stability in any part of the country. \nHowever, according to reports which had flooded the social media, the arrest was allegedly on the orders of the Kaduna state Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai who took to the offensive following Maikori’s advocacy wherein he was condemning the killings in Southern Kaduna. \nAudu’s lawyer had equally told newsmen yesterday that “Audu has been detained. There was nothing we could do as the detention order had been signed before his statement was even taken. The superior officers that could vary the detention order had all closed for the day leaving only the rank and file who were apparently, just obeying orders.” \nRecall also that Maikori’s troubles began when he wrongly tweeted that 6 students of a college of education were killed by Fulani herdsmen. The story which later turned out not to be correct saw Maikori writing a retraction to that effect. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:23:57.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
