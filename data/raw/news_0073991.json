We wanted to reward loyal Nokia phone fans and make a statement that rich heritage, innovation and modern design can go hand-in-hand,” Juho Sarvika, chief product officer of HMD Global, told the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona, according to The Telegraph. \nThe reinvented classic was unveiled in Barcelona alongside some of Nokia’s more up-to-date options, the Nokia 3, 5 and 6. \nHMD Global, owner of the Nokia brand, will partner with Foxconn for the manufacturing process of the next wave of Nokia phones, according to DNA India. \nREAD MORE: Smokin'!

Tech-heads around the world will have to wait until the second quarter of this year to find out. \nHMD Global says the new version “will retail at an average global retail price” of €49 ($51).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:56:30.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
