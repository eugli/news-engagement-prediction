Resentment and anger started to build. But when she texted, “So sorry, be there soon,” I replied, “No worries! Take your time :) ” I’d had it. I was really sick of this being nice shit. Agreeable Versus Too Agreeable \nOver the years, I’ve developed a problematic habit of taking my agreeableness too far. Being agreeable isn’t a bad quality. In psychological terms, being agreeable usually means you’re an empathetic person who craves social harmony . That’s great, but sometimes it manifests itself in a really disingenuous way . The Problem With Being Too Friendly The Problem With Being Too Friendly The Problem With Being Too Friendly Jerks can really ruin your day or worse, turn you into one of them. The world could stand to be a… Read more Read more \nPart of my agreeability has to do with empathy and understanding, but being understanding often goes hand in hand with the desire to be understood. In other words, we’re nice to people because we want them to be nice to us. It’s what we learned in grade school, after all. A big part of my agreeability is that I want people to like me and know that I’m a good person. It sounds sweet and all, but it’s actually a narcissistic need: I even want people to like me when I don’t like or care about them. Advertisement Advertisement \nFor this reason, agreeable people are often too nice . We agree to tasks we don’t have time to do. We agree to call a truce when we’re still hurt. We agree with opinions we don’t believe. And we agree to it all in the name of being loved and understood because we think pleasing others, somehow, will make us better people. \nIn The Book of No , social psychologist Susan Newman explains: \nWe live under this misconception that saying yes, being available, always at the ready for other people, makes us a better person, but in fact it does quite the opposite. You get stressed and anxious; you’re viewed as a patsy. \nIt’s obvious to see how this becomes a problem. You get so used to pleasing the people around you that after a while, you hardly remember what pleases you . This is why too-agreeable people are also frequently indecisive. We don’t know what we want because we overvalue what other people want. When Being Too Nice Backfires \nIronically, most people are displeased by people-pleasing. It’s a turnoff, and research like this 2010 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology supports this. Researchers asked subjects to play a game that included both individual and group rewards. They looked at how people reacted to selfish moves versus generous ones. You’d think they would like the generous players, but they actually disliked them just as much as the selfish ones: Sponsored \nAn initial study investigating tolerance of group members who abuse a public good surprisingly showed that unselfish members (those who gave much toward the provision of the good but then used little of the good) were also targets for expulsion from the group. Two follow-up studies replicated this and ruled out explanations grounded in the target being seen as confused or unpredictable. \nWhy did they want the nice players out of the game? The study pointed to two reasons. First, researchers suggested that the overly agreeable players made everyone else feel bad about themselves. Second everyone else also viewed the agreeable players as “rule-breakers,” in a way, because they weren’t sticking to standard norms for civility; they were overdoing it. And yep, the other members actually wanted to oust those players from the group. Trying too hard to be nice can actually make people treat you worse. \nIt doesn’t just apply to hypothetical games, though. In 2011, University of Notre Dame researchers found that agreeable employees earned significantly less than disagreeable ones. Specifically, agreeable men earned 18% less than disagreeable men while agreeable women earned 5% less than disagreeable women (the study suggested that agreeableness is perceived to be a more acceptable trait in women, so the gender gap is wider between disagreeable men and disagreeable women). When you’re too agreeable, you usually don’t rock the boat too much, and that can lead to becoming a pushover . It sounds obvious, but it helps to have numbers to back it up.

You sit on negative emotions rather than process them, and that backfires, too. Another study found that people with “high levels of agreeableness” were actually more judgmental than disagreeable people. Researchers called it the “Pollyanna Myth.” Advertisement Advertisement \nAcross studies, agreeable participants judged prosocial behaviors more favorably, but antisocial behaviors more unfavorably, than did disagreeable participants. \nIrony hits again: being too nice might actually make you kind of a judgemental jerk. Agreeableness is associated with empathy but if this study is any indication, too much of it can make you more judgmental instead. \nFinally, being too agreeable can also make you more susceptible to something called “groupthink.” This is basically a group’s tendency to ditch independent thought in favor of collective agreement. Teams with too many highly agreeable people on them tend to fall into this trap more often . In group situations, being disagreeable can actually make you think more independently and look beyond the obvious for other solutions. This is probably why I don’t work well in groups: I prioritize social harmony over innovation or creativity. You may have heard the joke that asserts a camel is just a horse designed by a committee. The truth … Read more Read more How to Stop \nUltimately, the solution to being less agreeable is to be okay with discord and people not liking you. That’s the price you pay for being yourself. As this video from The School of Life put it: Advertisement \nIn order to succeed at pleasing anyone we must first accept the risk that we might well displease them through a candid expression of our being. Successful charm relies on an initial secure sense that we could survive social failure...we must reconcile ourselves to the risk of not making friends to stand any chance of actually making any. \nAfter years of people pleasing, though, that’s a lot easier said than done. At its core, I realized that my people pleasing had to do with feeling submissive. I felt like everyone around me was better than me and it was my job to convince them I’m good enough. That might work well when you’re an intern, but at 30 dealing with day-to-day interactions, being submissive leads to all those aforementioned problems. Advertisement \nWith this in mind, I made some rules. Ultimately, you may have to figure out what helps you, but this is what helped me. Look at Every Interaction as a Challenge \nIt’s annoying to be contrarian for the sake of being contrarian, but it’s a useful exercise if you’re submissive. Normally, I mindlessly agree with people, especially strangers or acquaintances I don’t know very well, out of habit. To combat this, I took every interaction with a stranger as an opportunity to break that habit. For example, on a recent cheap flight, my seat passenger complained that our seats didn’t recline and that the crew was rude. Instinctively, I was inclined to agree, “oh I know, it’s awful.” Instead, I looked for a disagreeable counterpoint: “True, but I guess that’s why the prices are so cheap,” I said. “We get what we pay for.” She chuckled and agreed. Advertisement \nIt sounds petty, but that interaction made me feel slightly more confident, slightly dominant. This must seem slightly nuts to someone who doesn’t have this problem, but for a chronic people pleaser, disagreeing is a big deal. Taking on more of these “challenges” made me comfortable with speaking up in general. Pay Attention to Language \nWords are important, and as an agreeable person, I constantly used loaded language that prioritized others over myself. I was one of those people who constantly said “I’m sorry,” even if I had nothing to be sorry about (or even when I wasn’t sorry at all!) And when people would say “thank you,” to me, I’d usually respond with “Of course! No problem! Whatever you need!” \nI started to watch my language a little more. Instead of apologizing for nothing, I said “thank you” instead . Instead of saying, “whatever you need!” I simply said, “you’re welcome.” Novel concept, right? How to Stop Apologizing for Everything You Do How to Stop Apologizing for Everything You Do How to Stop Apologizing for Everything You Do For many of us, the word “sorry” has become something we reactively utter, regardless of whether… Read more Read more \nAnother tactic that helped was remembering that no one really cares . Most people are in the same boat and worried about how they come across, too. Or they just have their own stuff going on. Or they just don’t think you’re that important! And that’s actually pretty liberating. It means you can be yourself. Advertisement Advertisement \nOf course, you don’t want to take things to the other extreme and turn into a chronically disagreeable jerk . There’s a huge gray area between these two extremes. The idea is to balance kindness and civility without sacrificing your own sense of worth and confidence. \nIllustration by Sam Woolley ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T14:07:16.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
