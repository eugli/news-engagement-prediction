You have to embrace it,\" Mata told BBC’s Premier League Show. ALSO READ: Mourinho happy with Rooney's decision to stay \n\"When Jose came along, I wasn't playing lots. \n\"I had the chance to go to another great club and it was a good offer for Chelsea as well.\" \nWhen asked whether he had fallen out with Mourinho, Mata explained: \"I think it was a football reason, style, something like this. \n\"But no, we didn't have a personal problem. We are working together now and it is fine.\" \nMata has scored nine times for the Red Devils this season and is very happy under Mourinho. \nHe said: \"I think he understands what this club means. \n\"I think that's very important, to understand the history, the philosophy and what the fans are used to.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:40:57.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
