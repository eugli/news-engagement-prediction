Cases at hand are former governors Olagunsoye Oyinlola, Baba Bisi Akande who lived and worked between Ibadan and Lagos state prior to his election as governor in 1999, among others. \nFamurewa therefore enjoined all residents and citizens of the state to rally round the governor as he continues in the delivery of his electioneering promises. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:54:05.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
