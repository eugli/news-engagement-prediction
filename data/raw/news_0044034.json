I also tell stories, build things, and write about the future. Former “influencer” turned industry whistleblower. 2 days ago “Social media marketers” are ruining social media. Yes, I said it. To be clear, a “social media marketer” is that person who just swears by clickbait tactics. The person who chants innovation on social but can’t tell you what actual innovation looks like. The person who talks about creating content without actually creating content. On the whole, “social media marketers” claim to be experts, but their advice is mere window dressing with little substance. It’s a trend that has gotten out of hand. Like the used car salesmen of yesteryear, they’re out to make a quick buck at your expense. (This analogy will come back a few times, so buckle up. See what I did there?) Luckily, there are a few ways to spot a “social media marketer” before they waste your time or money. 1. Avoid the “trend hopper” Like everyone else, your typical “social media marketers” will be writing articles, tweeting, and posting video blogs while trends are hot (just Google “Snapchat Spectacles” to see what I’m talking about.) The problem? Many of the “social media marketer’s” ideas are simply regurgitated from websites full of checklists and clickbait articles promising a foolproof way for “content” to go “viral.” Content ends up getting recycled over and over again until eventually the original author is ten posts removed and out of the picture entirely. The things they’re selling are just strategies and best practices. It’s information you could find on your own in your spare time. Yes, there are a few people out there doing this the right way, providing value, creating good content, and building solid communities. (Ya’ll know who you are.) But they’re the exception, not the rule. 2. Watch out for the “update phenomenon” Updates have their pros and cons, but I have to say one of the worst aspects of them is how, like magic, they bring “social media marketers” out of the woodwork. Once a new feature comes out on Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat, they’ve got 15-minute video tutorials up, ASAP. The thirst is so real. They mask their attention-grabbing stunts as “expert recommendations” — but it’s all just to grow an audience. And the real casualty is the viewer who takes this one-off advice instead of finding the unique value of marketing on each specific platform. This is the only true way to win on social media. But thousands of “social media marketers” beg to differ. 3. Question your “gurus” Most gurus claim to serve the common man (or, in this case, common man in need of social media insights). But social media “gurus” seem to spend their time exclusively following or engaging with other social media “gurus.” The reality of the situation is simple: They’re selling you a lemon. They know it’s cheap, they know it’s crap, and they’re not giving you any real substance. 4. Speak their “language” “Use this!” “Post that!” “Utilize this style!” “Invest in this platform!” “Hop on this trend!” Quick translation: “Crap.” “Crap”. “Crap.” “Crap”. “I have no idea what I’m talking about.” Very little of what they say is grounded in reality, experience, or knowledge of what actually works. It’s little more than hopping up and down waving hands, begging for attention. Simply using a social platform doesn’t make you an expert, it just makes you a user of a social platform. To reference the car salesman analogy again (I warned you): driving a car doesn’t make me the ultimate authority on cars, it just means I’m someone who uses a car. I know how to turn it on, press the pedals, and get from point A to point B — like millions of other people around the world. 5. Check out their “experience” Wait. Who are these “social media marketers,” really? They’re usually marketing generalists or salespeople who’ve been in the same position for the past 15+ years. Stuck in their ways, spinning their wheels, doing their best to binge watch every single GaryVee Vlog (😳) they can find. I imagine them floating in zero gravity. Aimlessly wandering here and there without any real purpose or intent. 6. Frank, why are you so mad? (Technically, this isn’t a tip, but that won’t stop me from answering the question.) The short answer: wasted potential . “Social media marketers” could easily start making a real difference. They’d just have to stop wasting time sharing what’s already been said, and start using these platforms for themselves  — the way social networks were intended. Today, people are seeking wisdom, not just knowledge. They don’t want to just know how to do something, but why . So many “marketers” and “gurus” haven’t actually done anything with the “knowledge” they tout. They aren’t testing or trying things for themselves. Just tapping retweet doesn’t cut it. Attending a seminar doesn’t either. Reading about it isn’t going to move the needle. If you’re a “social media marketer,” it’s not too late. Change is difficult, but not impossible. First, you have to stop crying. It’s not that bad — and I believe in you. Now, you must take action. You must become an expert by creating something completely original for yourself. A few examples to get you started: Post an epic Snapchat story about your love affair with coffee told over 15 wonderfully intricate stories. Publish a novel condensed into 75 tweets. Record a daily vlog, but of you eating and reviewing bagels (or donuts). Create anything that gives you an edge, bragging rights, or a deeper appreciation for the community you want to market towards. Oh, and you’ll need to forget about monetizing it. Focus on doing  — not promoting. Promote later. First, you must create. That’s where you get first-hand knowledge. That’s your edge in this space. It’s what separates the wheat from the chaff — but it’s hard work. You’ll need to become passionate. Focused. Consistent. You’ll need to keep your head down, silence the haters, and just do . Bottom Line: Want a great social media marketer? Find a content creator. Or better yet, become one . To call back to that used car salesman analogy one last time: It’s the Internet. Here, you can build your own car — you don’t have to sell someone else’s. Unsolicited advice for brands: Brands, I love you. I see you every day. I buy stuff from you, and I want you to be strong and beautiful. Please don’t work with “social media marketers.” Work with content creators . A content creator is someone who has done the work. They’ve put in the time and reaped the rewards. Bonus points if they’ve done it for themselves and found success on their own. These people can replicate that success for you because they’ve got wisdom at their disposal. Look for people who know their industry because they’ve owned their industry. Need solid social strategies? Hire content creators, not “social strategists.” Creators don’t give themselves titles. They don’t really call themselves social media marketers. They keep their heads down and focus on scratching their own itch. They’re the people creating for themselves, and learning along the way.
