Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email America will soon be a single party state, Donald Trump warned today in an astonishing Fox News interview.\nHe accused Barack Obama of being behind widespread protests against his presidency as well as a string of unhelpful and embarrassing leaks to the press.\nAnd asked to grade his performance as President so far, he gave himself an “A” for performance, an “A+” for effort a “C” for communication - admitting “my messaging isn’t good.”\nSpeaking on morning TV news programme Fox & Friends, which he has previously listed among the few US news sources he deemed trustworthy, he made wild claims about his presidential predecessor.\nHe provided no evidence to back up his claims.\n(Photo: Getty Images North America) “I think that President Obama’s behind it because his people are certainly behind [the protests],” Trump said. “And some of the leaks possibly come from that group, you know, some of the leaks – which are very serious leaks, because they’re very bad in terms of national security.”\nHe said Democrat House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was “incompetent”, and said her party was getting “smaller and smaller”.\nThis is untrue\nWhile the Republicans remain in control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the Democratic party gained two Senate seats and six House seats in the 2016 election. He said: “You know, in a certain way I hate to see it because I like a two-party system. “And we’re soon going to have a one-party system. I actually think a two-party system is healthy and good. But she’s done a terrible job.\n(Photo: AFP) He insisted his heavy crackdown on undocumented migrants in the US, which has left some migrant communities living in fear, was “more focused” on getting “bad people” out of the country.\nHe said: “We’re much tougher in terms of getting the bad guys out. People don’t realise, [Obama] deported a lot of people. But we’re focused on the bad people. We’re focused on the drug lords and the gang members.\nRead More US immigrants 'living in fear' as Donald Trump's crackdown sees hundreds arrested in raids “We’re focused on a very, very bad group that are in this country that we’re getting out rapidly. He was much less focused on that.”\nThis is untrue Donald Trump’s new guidelines dramatically increase the number of undocumented workers at risk of instant deportation Under the Obama administration, the guidelines targeted people convicted of serious crimes for deportation They also restricted “instant deportation” to people who had been in the country less than 14 days, and were close to the border Both of these guidelines were massively broadened - putting undocumented immigrants charged with minor crimes, including traffic offences, at risk of deportation As such, Trump’s crackdown on undocumented migrants is, in reality, much less focused on the “bad people”, “drug lords and gang members.” Read More Donald Trump plans would grant sweeping new powers to 'aggressively' detain and deport immigrants Elsewhere in the wide-ranging interview he described Obamacare, which combined with Medicare expansion, has provided health insurance to around 20 million Americans who previously didn’t have it, as a “mess” and a failure.\nBut he insisted his replacement plan, details of which have been long promised, but have yet to surface is “really terrific” and “inclusive.”\nRepublican congressmen are returning to Washington from a week in their districts, where thousands of angry voters turned up at Town Hall debates to berate them for planning to scrap the Affordable Care Act.\n(Photo: Getty Images North America) And he seemed to suggest the US would start asking for money in exchange for providing military assistance.\nSpeaking about how he plans to improve the state of the economy, he said: “We’re going to be doing things having to do with other countries. We’re treated very, very unfairly.\n“When we help them, even militarily, we’re going to ask for a form of reimbursement.”\nAnd he said despite ending his first month in office with the lowest approval rating of any president in US history, a recent poll showed \"the level of enthusiasm for me is as strong as they've ever seen.\"\nHe did not specify to which poll he was referring, and the Mirror has been unable to identify a poll that matches this claim.\nLike us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Politics Newsletter Follow @MirrorPolitics Subscribe to our Politics newsletter Enter email Subscribe Comments Show more comments More On Fox News House of Representatives Donald Trump Barack Obama Nancy Pelosi Crime Health insurance The economy Politics Foxes", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorPolitics", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1942/4221396001_5341449084001_5341429298001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001"], "published": "2017-02-28T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T19:41:10.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
