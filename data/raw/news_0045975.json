Nothing says cozy up quite like a pair of pants bearing the image of a sexualized female cartoon character who started out as an anthropomorphic French poodle. (Amazon) \n\"Officers entered the residence and found 37-year-old Brad Vaughan in a bedroom wearing only a pair of Betty Boop pajama bottoms belonging to one of the victims. His clothes were on the floor,\" police stated on their Facebook page. \n\"The victims did not know Vaughan nor did he have permission to be there. He was arrested and charged with Burglary of a Habitation.” \nHe's currently being held on $10,000 bail.
