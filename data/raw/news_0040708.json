Mexican officials took it away. \nAgents said they spotted the delivery system after seeing a group of people running away from the fence on Mexico’s side. When they went to investigate, they found the structure locked onto the fence’s south side. They then found two bundles of marijuana, weighing a total of 47 pounds. #USBP agents spring into action dismantling catapult used to launch #Marijuana #Honorfirst — CBP Arizona (@CBPArizona) February 14, 2017 \nThough the contraption may sound ridiculous, it’s not the first pot pitcher found. \nA similar catapult was discovered in 2011 near Arizona. (You can check out video of it launching here.) \nLast September, authorities also found a bazooka that they said was used to fire drugs across the border.
