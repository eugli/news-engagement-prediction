The social media feud began when Scarborough re-tweeted a post Sunday evening from President Trump, who had thanked Miller for discussing the legal aspects of the president’s recent executive action on immigration — and added his own critical commentary.\n“I hope the president is talking about The Steve Miller Band and not that kid who embarrassed the White House this morning,” Scarborough wrote, adding the hashtag, “#SweatsLikeMarco.”\nI hope the president is talking about The Steve Miller Band and not that kid who embarrassed the White House this morning. #SweatsLikeMarco https://t.co/IqHiOXtE3V\n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 13, 2017\nHannity responded shortly afterward with a series of tweets in which he suggested Scarborough focus on improving his “horrific ratings” instead of attacking Miller.\nJoe why don't you focus on getting your horrific ratings up. They totally suck. And I'll take Steve Miller on my team over u any day. https://t.co/9FKBvpYRXp\n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 13, 2017\nJoe maybe it's time we start talking about who you really are. What do you think? https://t.co/9FKBvpYRXp\n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 13, 2017\nSteve Miller works 18 hour days serving the country and the @POTUS What do you do? Basically talk to yourself & @morningmika Nobody watches! https://t.co/9FKBvpYRXp\n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 13, 2017\nJoe What an elitist snob. Obviously Steve was talking about enumerated constitutional powers of the POTUS being commander in chief. https://t.co/rRAnHl5MmK\n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 13, 2017\nJoe u would cede executive power to unelected and unaccountable judicial activists on the 9 th circuit? @POTUS cited USC 8 1182. Read it!!! https://t.co/rRAnHl5MmK\n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 13, 2017\nLast point I have a radio show to do. Watch your reaction Can u not see what a pompous arrogant jackass u are? U Avg what .7 .2 ?Connection? https://t.co/rRAnHl5MmK\n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 13, 2017\nThe Morning Joe host did not respond directly to Hannity’s tweets but told Washington Examiner reporter Gabby Morrongiello that he found it wasn’t “worth the time” to respond.\nSorry to disappoint you. A \"war between\" suggests that I have found it worth my time to respond. I haven't. https://t.co/0uVwWduEFN\n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 13, 2017\nHannity then seized on that tweet to call for Scarborough to stop being a “bully” and invite Miller onto his show.\nWe know y you really won't respond Joe. Don't we? So you viscously and arrogantly attack a person you know Cannot Fight back. https://t.co/yv0mtEDSbD\n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 13, 2017\nLet's make a deal. You leave Steven Miller alone (as you know he cannot respond) and I'll ignore you like most of America does. https://t.co/yv0mtEDSbD\n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 13, 2017\nOr Joe, instead of being a bully, invite Steven on your show for a one on one debate. Not 10 on 1. My $ is on Miller. https://t.co/yv0mtEDSbD\n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) February 13, 2017\nScarborough kept up his criticism of Miller’s appearances on Twitter Monday, following the brief exchange with Hannity.\nStephen Miller’s authoritarian declaration and the White House's \"massive claim to power.\" https://t.co/FWqX2owWX7\n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 13, 2017\nTrump adviser Stephen Miller lied — and it matters. His \"disgraceful, lying-through-your-teeth\" interviews. https://t.co/L5MzaTzC1Q\n— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 13, 2017\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum\n Government , Big Journalism , Donald Trump , Joe Scarborough , MSNBC , Sean Hannity , Stephen Miller", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JoeNBC/status/830948832380911616", "https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/831229132474298368", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fbig-journalism%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fsean-hannity-rips-joe-scarborough-twitter-feud-stephen-miller%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Sean+Hannity+Rips+Joe+Scarborough+in+Twitter+Feud+Over+Stephen+Miller&shortener=bitly", "https://twitter.com/JoeNBC/status/831255390507655169", "https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/831200026143637505", "https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/831199219650277376", "https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/831224030795591680", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fbig-journalism%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fsean-hannity-rips-joe-scarborough-twitter-feud-stephen-miller%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Sean+Hannity+Rips+Joe+Scarborough+in+Twitter+Feud+Over+Stephen+Miller", "https://twitter.com/JoeNBC/status/831202499193401346", "https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/831201403129454592", "https://twitter.com/POTUS", "https://twitter.com/morningmika", "https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/831016628016013312", "https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/831015502025736194", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fbig-journalism%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fsean-hannity-rips-joe-scarborough-twitter-feud-stephen-miller%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Sean+Hannity+Rips+Joe+Scarborough+in+Twitter+Feud+Over+Stephen+Miller", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/SweatsLikeMarco?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/dznussbaum", "https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/831015699300630528", "https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/831224982877458432", "https://twitter.com/JoeNBC/status/831254976706015233"], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:09:33.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
