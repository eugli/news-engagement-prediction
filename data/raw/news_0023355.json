Of course, they’re rarely cheap ... but such is the price of love. And in case you were wondering about the game’s popularity, some teams sold more than a whopping 2 million jerseys just for 2016. \nHere are the 10 teams that sold the most kits last year, via the Manchester Evening News. \n10. AC MILAN – 650,000 KITS media_camera AC Milan crack the top 10. \nAC Milan aren’t having the greatest year in Serie A, but new ownership has given the team a much-needed jolt. Even if the Rossoneri are in a rut, their kits still fly off the shelves. \n9. PARIS ST. GERMAIN – 685,000 KITS media_camera Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani. \nNo Zlatan? No problem. At least on the kit-sales front. PSG are in a race to defend their Ligue 1 title, but they’re far and away leading the French league in jersey sales. \n8. LIVERPOOL – 705,000 KITS media_camera Liverpool are still popular around the globe despite their league drought. \nThe first Premier League team on the list comes in at No. 8. Liverpool’s red kits are among the most iconic in the world, and they’re usually quite slick. No wonder people keep buying them. \n7. JUVENTUS – 850,000 KITS media_camera Juventus' new logo might boost sales further. \nJuve look well on their way to a sixth-straight Scudetto. Their trademark black-and-white striped kit still pulls in folks willing to shell out for them. Perhaps they received a boost once people saw Juventus’ new logo? \n6. ARSENAL – 1,225,000 KITS media_camera Arsenal's Chilean striker Alexis Sanchez. \nThe Gunners cracked the million mark, and one has to think that Alexis Sanchez’s revelatory form played a big hand in that. \n5. BAYERN MUNICH – 1,500,000 media_camera Bayern Munich's dominance in German translates to sales. \nWhat do you get when you’re the biggest club in Germany, replete with titles and a perennial contender in the Champions League? You crack the top 5 in kit sales, that’s what. \n4. CHELSEA – 1,650,000 KITS media_camera Top of the EPL, but second in English kit sales. \nThe Blues had a miserable start to 2016, but turned things around by the end of the year. Antonio Conte pumped life into the team, and fans pumped money into the team shop cash registers. \n3. BARCELONA – 1,980,000 KITS media_camera Barcelona's trio of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar sell a lot of kits. \nLionel Messi. Neymar. Luis Suarez. Those three alone probably make up the bulk of Barcelona’s kit sales, but there are plenty of other Blaugrana players worth representing. \n2. REAL MADRID – 2,290,000 KITS media_camera Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo. \nCristiano Ronaldo’s 2016 was simply unforgettable. Why wouldn’t you want a kit to remember that success? You know, unless you’re a Barcelona fan. \n1. MANCHESTER UNITED – 2,850,000 KITS media_camera Manchester United's Paul Pogba is a popular figure. \nUnited splashed a boatload of cash over the summer for the likes of Paul Pogba, so it’s not a huge surprise they’re top of the heap. Pogba’s arguably the coolest player on the planet, with a keen fashion sense that is dwarfed only by his talent. Pogba kits: So hot right now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T13:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:24:16.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
