We did a lot of things right in this Test, that's for sure. But there are still areas that we can improve on,\" Smith said after the win on Saturday . \n\nThe last time the Aussies won a series in India was in 2004-05. Smith, a cricket with a keen sense of history, didn't need a reminder. \n\n\"Coming to India, we haven't won a game here in 4,502 days,\" the visiting skipper said, referring to their victory in Nagpur on a green-tinged track at the VCA ground. \n\nSmith has his eyes firmly set on replicating the success of the side led by Ricky Ponting. \"But it's going to be a tough road, we know India are going to come back incredibly hard. They're an amazing team particularly in their own backyard. And we've got to be ready for it.\" \n\nIt's a remarkable turnaround for Australia and Smith personally after he flew back home midway through the ODI series in Sri Lanka in August last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:52:29.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
