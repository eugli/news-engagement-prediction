You can safely ignore all those brackets. This is the only one that matters: A 67-animal bracket that pits mammals* against each other in simulated battles to the death** to determine which mammal reigns supreme. Ladies and gentlemen and hairy, milk-producing orders of all ages, I give you the fifth annual March Mammal Madness. March Mammal Madness 2017 March Mammal Madness 2017 March Mammal Madness 2017 Don’t call it a comeback … we’ve been here for years. FIVE years to be exact. And for this 5 th … Read more Read more \nBiologist Twitter is the only good Twitter, filled with good vibes and an urge to teach and lots of really cool animal photos. But even scientists who spend their lives studying these creatures can’t resist the urge to imagine how they’d do trying to beat the shit out of one another. Truly, conducting involved thought experiments about animals fighting is the thing that makes us human. Advertisement Advertisement \nThe bracket is above ( here for hi-res), and here’s how the winners of each round will be determined: \nScientific literature is cited to substantiate likely outcomes as a probabilistic function of the two species’ attributes within the battle environment. Attributes considered in calculating battle outcome include temperament, weaponry, armor, body mass, running speed, fight style, physiology, and motivation. \nIn the earlier rounds, the better-ranked seed has home-ecology advantage. For the final three rounds, the battlefield will be chosen at random. \nRunning the tournament will be Dr. Katie Hinde , Associate Professor, School of Human Evolution & Social Change, Center for Evolution and Medicine, Arizona State University; Dr. Josh Drew , Lecturer, Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology, Columbia University; and Dr. Chris Anderson , Assistant Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, Dominican University. They’ll be joined by a host of other “battle narrators” to give realistic outcomes from each match-up, and maybe teach you a little something about the animals at the same time. Sponsored \nYou can follow along with the tournament at its website , or on Twitter . Past winners include the tundra wolf, the Sumatran rhino, and a hyena clan. Place your bets now, though I really don’t see how anyone takes this from the Sabertooth Cat. (Yes, there are extinct mammals in here, as well as mythical ones.) \n*So, it’s only mostly mammals. The Gila monster is in this tournament. Because it’s cool, that’s why.

This meant that the dhole was still full from the night before and unwilling to take the risks of tangling with the binturong. Even a small claw cut or bite wound can get infected and lots of times an animal will back down rather than take a risk for little potential benefit. \nSee, I told you this is scientifically rigorous. Now bring on the animal fights! Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T20:51:37.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
