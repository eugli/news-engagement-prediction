Then he tried to get Mallrats 2 made, and it went from a movie to a TV show, and no networks picked it up, so that’s scrapped. He still wants to bring Jay and Silent Bob back, and those are the only two characters he owns still, so he got to work on a screenplay. \nAs for the plot, a movie studio is going into production on a Bluntman and Chronic reboot, and Jay and Silent Bob are gonna try to stop that from happening. Which is, basically, the exact plot from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. But hey, fuck it, I’m excited! \nIf you’re wondering why the MMA guy is blogging about a Kevin Smith movie, it’s because I’m a big Kevin Smith guy. Like, Y GE. My “Why not?” tattoo is inspired by this speech he gave in 2012… \nI cared enough about this fucker to get one of his quotes permanently inked on my skin and see his movie about a guy getting turned into a god damn walrus multiple times in theaters. \nJay and Silent Bob coming back is essentially my Super Bowl. Like, if the Super Bowl happened 6 times ever and the most recent one was in 2006. Not a great analogy but you get the fucking point. I’m thrilled.
