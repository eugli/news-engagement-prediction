The Ras Al Khaimah police have successfully managed to rescue an Emirati man, along with his wife and daughter after they lost their way at the Wadi Ghalil, 30km to the north of RAK city. The central operations room of the RAK police, when alerted about the missing trio, immediately dispatched a rescue team from the air wing section to search the rough mountainous area, 5000 feet above the sea level. An informed source with the RAK police told Khaleej Times that the rescue team has finally found the missing man, woman and daughter after around 30 minutes of extensive search. \"The trio, who were thirsty and over exhausted, were airlifted to the Saqr hospital for treatment and medical care.\" The rescued man said that they walked up to the high mountainous area for six hours, and could no longer find our way back home. \"My wife even got over exhausted all of a sudden, and needed an urgent intervention to rescue here.\" Wing Commander Saeed Rashid Al Yamahi, Head of the Air Wing Section, said the RAK Police spare no effort to hone the skills of its staff and provide them with regular training courses. \"The Air Wing Section has performed a variety of rescue operations on the land, in the sea and atop high mountains, let alone national, community and police functions.\" The section is all set round the clock to quickly and professionally respond to all emergency cases, he added. \"Our well-trained staffers are equipped with all rescue facilities needed.\" Al Yamahi pointed out that the section, whenever alerted by the Central Operations Room about any case, immediately took action, started rescue operation, and reached the target site in a record time. \"A chopper, for example, was dispatched to the Ghalila area where the entire area was extensively searched until three lost climbers lost in the mountains were found in a record time of only 15 minutes.\" Advising, he said tourists and visitors need to be fully attentive to the road and at rough mountainous areas. \"All adventurers need to be equipped with all necessary electronic devices to easily locate themselves and find their way back.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:12:32.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
