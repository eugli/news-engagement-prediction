Indeed, it will no longer be a hotel but a new product in line with today’s life. \n\"How many stars? This hotel will be beyond stars.” \nOnce completed, the building will constantly be changing as each apartment will rotate independently, at adjustable speeds. \nThe firm’s website further stated that, “hotel guests will be given the unique opportunity to shape the building and choose their view, thus redefining completely luxury in the hospitality sector. In doing so, they will also design the building and the skyline of the city. \nOnce completed, the 80-storey building will become the first 4D skyscraper in the world, and will reach a staggering 420 metres in height covering an area of around 1.2 million square feet. \nThe building will also feature wind turbines positioned horizontally between each floor and solar panels on the roof, which will allow it to be completely self-powered.
