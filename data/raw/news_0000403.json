It is available only at certain private hospitals or clinics. \n\"The ministry's pharmacy department has also carried out DNA tests to ensure that the vaccines that we use are free from pork and pig derivatives. \n\"So, if the exco member wants to claim that the DAP-led Penang government would be the first to build a syariah-compliant hospital in Malaysia, I suggest that he take a look at what we have done at the ministry,\" he said. \nIt was reported that the DAP-led Penang government would build the Islamic hospital costing RM280mil in Bayan Baru and it is expected to begin operations in 2020. - Bernama <> <>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T15:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T12:52:31.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
