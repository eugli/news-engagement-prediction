At 18:31 the government tweeted an apology.\n“We would like to deeply apologise for the previous retweet. It was a mistake. We reiterate that any form of violence is unacceptable.”\nGovernment communications director Donald Liphoko told News24 that a junior official was under the impression that he was tweeting from his personal handle.\n“He told me that he made an honest mistake,” Liphoko said.\nHe would discuss the matter with the official on Monday.\nThe govt's apology tweet.
