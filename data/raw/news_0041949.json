Some former employees told CNNMoney they were subject to retaliation after they tried to stop the sales tactics. \nRelated: Wells Fargo admits to signs of worker retaliation \nSince the scandal came to light, Wells Fargo has been under investigation by the Department of Justice, Congressional committees, state attorneys general and prosecutors offices. Customers, employees and shareholders have also launched class-action lawsuits against Wells Fargo. \nThe company's board of directors also opened an independent investigation into the practices. In a news release Tuesday, Wells Fargo said that investigation is expected to finish before the bank's annual shareholder meeting in April. \nWells Fargo identified the four employees it fired as: \n- Claudia Russ Anderson, former community bank chief risk officer. \n- Pamela Conboy, Arizona lead regional president. \n- Shelley Freeman, former Los Angeles regional president. \n- Matthew Raphaelson, head of community bank strategy and initiatives. \nThe executives won't receive a 2016 bonus, and the company says they will forfeit all of their unvested equity awards as well as any vested outstanding options. \nWells Fargo fired 5,300 workers for creating millions of fake accounts. \nIn October, embattled company CEO John Stumpf retired suddenly, and forfeited $41 million in stock awards. \n--CNNMoney's Matt Egan contributed to this story.
