It was developed after a 2012 survey found that 63% of underage victims were being bought or sold online. \nMr Kutcher, who is married to actress Mila Kunis and has two children, said that he aimed to help victims around the world with his work at Thorn after being affected by what he had seen. \n\"I've seen video content of a child that's the same age as mine, being raped by an American man who was a sex tourist in Cambodia. This child was so conditioned by her environment that she thought she was engaging in play.\" \nHe told those present at the Ending Modern Slavery hearing that his organisation had been approached by authorities to help track online perpetrators with new technology. \n\"We were the last line of defence - an actor and his foundation,\" he said, adding: \"That's my day job, and I'm sticking to it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:08:12.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
