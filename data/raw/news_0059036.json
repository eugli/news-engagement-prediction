Police discovered the body during a search after Stewart's arrest (Photo: John McLellan) Stewart parked a Jeep over the spot Helen was buried (Photo: Police handout) The author's body was eventually found in a cesspit underneath the garage (Photo: Police handout) \n“He said he was getting fed up with all this now. We explained again the reasons why we wanted to search the house, and he said ‘you keep saying it’s the last time’. \n“He became upset, his breathing increased and he began rubbing his forehead. He appeared to be anxious and uncomfortable with what we were asking of him. \n\"He went on to say that 'you won't find anything in the garage, if anywhere, devices will be in the house'.\" \nThe 55-year-old stunned neighbours by jetting off on a two-week luxury holiday to Majorca as fears continued to grow for the much-loved children's author. Jurors were shown laser images of the tank Ms Bailey lay undiscovered in the cesspit for three months Then tank went several feet underground \nBut as Stewart distanced himself from the web of deceit he'd created back home, detectives were piecing together his money-grabbing murder plot - and were ready to swoop when he returned on July 11. \nHe greeted officers warmly as he made his way down the stairs of the £1.2m Hertfordshire mansion, little knowing the net had finally closed in on him. \n\"You're joking\", he responded, taking a step back as he was told he was being arrested on suspicion of murder. \nStewart shrugged, ran his hands through his ruffled hair and glanced around the room in apparent shock as his crimes were read out to him. \nAfter sitting down on the bottom step, he continued to feign the disbelief and concern for his partner's safety which would become the cornerstone of his \"absurd\" defence. Stewart was hauled out of bed and arrested in July last year He feigned a stunned reaction when told he was a murder suspect \nHe said: \"Bloody hell, why?... Why? I don't understand... What's happened? Have you found her? Where is she?\" \nBut the former software engineer's demeanour quickly changed as he was taken to Stevenage Police Station for questioning. \nStewart sat in silence with one arm on the table and another thrown back over his chair during five hours of questioning. \nAfter being charged with murder, Stewart embarked on a fantastical change of alibi. \nHe claimed two kidnappers - named 'Nick' and 'Joe' - had abducted the children's author in a plot he had been too scared to tell police about previously. \nStewart said the \"rude and aggressive\" men had first turned up at their house a month before Helen's death and returned on the day of Helen's murder. The killer refused to speak during five hours of questioning He went on to change his alibi after being charged with murder \nHe claimed he was punched to the ground by 'Nick' and told to tell anyone who asked Helen had gone to Broadstairs. \nIncredibly, he also told the court he had spoken to Helen four days later - on the day he reported her missing. \nHe said Nick returned to the house and handed him a mobile phone, before Helen told him: \"I love you. Sorry about everything\". \nThe murder suspect described Joe as being aged around 65, with olive skin, a foreign accent, “sunken cheeks” and short, smart grey hair. \nNick was said to be a “large, wide man” in his late 50s, slightly taller than Joe, with short black hair, tattoos on his neck and a London accent. \nBut the half-baked alibi was embarrassingly exposed at St Albans Crown Court when two men known to Stewart - neighbour Nick Cook and bowls player Joe Cippullo - were presented to the court. Ms Bailey was preyed upon following the death of her husband John (pictured) (Photo: SOUTH BEDS NEWS AGENCY 01582 572) Helen was buried along with pet Daschund Boris (Photo: SWNS - Cambridge +44 (0)11790665) Stewart was convicted following a six-week trial (Photo: PA) \nIt was put to the defendant that he had based his descriptions on the pair. \nMr Trimmer asked: “You recognise them, do you, Mr Stewart?” \nStewart replied: “Yes, it’s Nick and Joe.” \nStewart said he had known Joe for over ten years but neither man had crossed his mind for months. \nHe added: “Well Nick is Nick, nothing like the Joe I described and Nick is nothing like the image I described.” \nProsecutor Stuart Trimmer openly mocked the defence, telling the jury: \"You are asked to trust this man's word, that Nick and Joe exist, and he is, without doubt, a full-blown liar. \n\"The tale beyond this becomes so absurd that a child that wrote this in his essay aged 11 might be laughed at by the rest of his class.\" \nHe now faces the rest of his life in jail and will be sentenced at a later date.
