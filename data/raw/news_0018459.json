places in the Premier League is hotter than ever, particularly among the top six. Aguero, Anthony Martial and Cesc Fabregas are just some of the superstar names missing out when the big names are forced onto the substitutes’ bench every week. This super-subs XI compiled by Sportsmail cost £200million in the open market and would probably back themselves to mount a title challenge regardless of being unwanted by their current managers. 3-4-3 Manchester City Transfer fee: £15milion from Barcelona, 2016 Controversially signed by Pep Guardiola to replace Joe Hart, Bravo has already been ditched from City’s starting team after suffering the worst saves-to-shots ratio in the league. Chile’s World Cup goalkeeper was primarily brought in from Barcelona because of his footballing ability but forgot his core business, keeping the ball out of the net. At one stage, he’d conceded 14 goals from 22 shots and Guardiola has now plumped for Willy Caballero. Claudio Bravo replaced Joe Hart in the summer but has been on the bench in recent games JOHN TERRY Chelsea Transfer fee: Came through academy ranks Legendary skipper was belatedly given a 12-month contract for this season after it appeared he would be leaving Stamford Bridge. Yet he has been forced to play as supporting role under Antonio Conte with the Italian opting for Azpilicueta, Luiz and Cahill as his preferred back-three. Terry, 36, has accepted his new status and graciously said he wouldn’t mind not playing again this season if it meant the team continuing to win. His last Premier League appearance came in November. Since then he’s played in two FA Cup ties, one of which against Peterborough ended in a red card. John Terry has not played much this season but accepted his position in the squad graciously VINCENT KOMPANY Manchester City Transfer fee: £6million from Hamburg, 2008 Captain and long-time talisman at The Etihad Stadium, 30-year-old Kompany has been blighted by injuries during Pep Guardiola's time in charge and his presence on the substitutes' bench against Swansea on Sunday indicates the Belgian can no longer see himself as an automatic first choice even when available. Kompany has missed a total of two-and-a-half years through injuries since joining City with calf problems a particular issue. Guardiola will still want him around the dressing-room to guide John Stones through the next period of his career but how many minutes Kompany is given on the pitch is a different matter altogether Vincent Kompany's Manchester City career has been blighted by injury LUKE SHAW Manchester United Transfer fee: £27million from Southampton, 2014 England’s youngest player at the last World Cup, Shaw is now fighting to save his Old Trafford career having been criticised and largely overlooked by Jose Mourinho. The left-back has not been able to win a regular place back at Old Trafford since suffering a particularly bad broken leg last season. Still only 21, Shaw has not been picked for a Premier League game since October and though niggling injuries have often been sited as the reason, that excuse is beginning to wear a little thin. He still wants to have a long-term future at United but needs to convince his manager. Luke Shaw appears to be fighting to save his Manchester United career after being overlooked by manager Jose Mourinho MOUSSA SISSOKO Tottenham Transfer fee: £30million from Newcastle, 2016 Spurs pipped Everton to Sissoko’s signature on transfer deadline day last summer but Mauricio Pochettino has preferred to use him off the bench with nine of the French international’s 15 Premier League appearances coming as a substitute. ‘Sissoko needs to work hard to show he deserves to be in the team,’ said his manager in late-November. Since when he has started only two league games and played only the last nine minutes in Tottenham’s latest win against Middlesbrough last Saturday. Moussa Sissoko moved from Newcastle to Spurs in the summer but has not started much CESC FABREGAS Chelsea Transfer fee: £27million from Barcelona, 2014 A former midfield general for Arsenal and Barcelona and creator of the winning goal in the 2010 World Cup final, Fabregas still isn’t assured of a starting place in Antonio Conte’s all-conquering Chelsea team, lacking the steel of Kante and Martic, pace of Pedro and Hazard or mobility to be a top wing-back. So the Spaniard has had to be patient and make a contribution when called upon, as he notably did in the 3-1 win at Manchester City which now looks a major turning point in the title race. Conte has been grateful for Fabregas professionalism. ‘I'm very pleased about Cesc's attitude and commitment,’ says the Chelsea boss. ‘When you are in a great team, some players have to start on the bench.’ Cesc Fabregas has been used mainly off the bench for Chelsea this season BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER Manchester United Transfer fee: £14million from Bayern Munich, 2015 Condemned to train with the reserves by Jose Mourinho at the start of the season, Schweinsteiger steadfastly refused to leave Manchester United but although he’s been welcomed back into the first-team squad, he’s still a long way from being a part of their Premier League team. The German World Cup winner showed his class by scoring in a rare appearance against Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup but Mourinho doesn’t believe he has the energy of Paul Pogba or Ander Herrera, and has preferred Michael Carrick as the elder statesman in midfield. Bastian Schweinsteiger has been left out of Manchester United's squad for much of the season ANTHONY MARTIAL Manchester United Transfer fee: £36million from Monaco, 2015 Looked a world-beater under Louis van Gaal last season and a key member of United’s FA Cup-winning side, he currently seems locked in a battle of wills with Jose Mourinho with the player regularly left out of the big Premier League games. Martial is behind Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Juan Mata, Marcus Rashford and possibly even Jesse Lingard in the battle for places in wide positions and not even an impressive showing in the FA Cup win against Wigan could get him a kick in Sunday’s 3-0 win at Leicester. The Frenchman has refuted claims he is going to move back to the French League but he’ll want more gametime at Old Trafford in the remaining weeks of the season. Anthony Martial started off his career very brightly but has fallen down the pecking order DANIEL STURRIDGE Liverpool Transfer fee: £12million from Chelsea, 2013 Has become something of a forgotten man under Jurgen Klopp, starting just five Premier League games this season despite being first pick for the new England manager Gareth Southgate against Scotland. Injuries have not helped Sturridge’s cause but beyond that his individuality rather than desire to press doesn’t seem to fit in with Klopp’s pattern of play. It even seems to have affected his sharpness in front of goal with the 27-year-old failing to score in his last seven games Daniel Sturridge has started just five games for Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool this season OLIVIER GIROUD Arsenal Transfer fee: £12million from Montpellier, 2012 Alexis Sanchez’s switch to centre-forward has restricted Giroud’s opportunities even though he has impressed when called upon, particularly with his scorpion kick goal against Crsytal Palace. The Frenchman has netted 11 times this season, including six in his last eight games, but being put on the substitute’s bench for the weekend defeat at Chelsea signalled where he stands in the pecking order at the moment, and that’s unlikely to change radically with Danny Welbeck now also fit. Olivier Giroud has scored 11 goals this season but has started a lot of games on the bench OLIVIER GIROUD Manchester City Transfer fee: £31million from Atletico Madrid, 2011 Hailed not so long ago as the only world-class player in the Premier League by Alan Shearer, Aguero’s stock has fallen rapidly and he can no longer get in ahead of a rookie teenager from Brazil, Gabriel Jesus. Aguero started the season on fire with 11 goals in his first six matches but the Argentine has struggled since to fit in with Guardiola’s “philosophy” and teamwork ethic. The only team he has scored against in the Premier League in the last three months is Burnley. Sergio Aguero has found himself on the bench in recent weeks after the arrival of Gabriel Jesus ..AND SUPER-SUB FOR THE SUPER-SUBS MICHY BATSHUAYI Chelsea Transfer fee: £33million from Marseille, 2016 The Belgian Euro 2016 player was linked with a number of English clubs last summer before Chelsea got their man. But he’s failed to make a Premier League start with his only league goal from 15 substitute appearances coming back in August at Watford. So far, the 23-year-old has been reduced to being in Antonio Conte’s second-string team, scoring twice apiece in the FA Cup and EFL Cup. He was wanted back at Marseille and by Swansea in January and unless Conte has a change of heart, he could be deemed surplus to requirements in the summer. Michy Batshuayi signed for £33m in the summer but has not started many games RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:14:31.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
