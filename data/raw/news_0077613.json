On the floor? In the trunk? In an NPR tote bag in the backseat? Nope. Ford wants to store a travel pillow in the head rest, of course. \nThis new patent filing by Ford illustrates a secret compartment built-into a vehicle’s head rest. There’s a little door that when removed reveals a travel pillow — you know, the kind that wraps around a neck and is just moderately more comfortable than resting your head on a shoe. \nFord notes in the filing that car headrests are not designed to facility a comfortable snooze. They’re designed to combat whiplash. Therefore, this patent, if implemented, would provide a solution for passengers to snooze comfortably while utilizing unused space in the vehicle. 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:32:37.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
