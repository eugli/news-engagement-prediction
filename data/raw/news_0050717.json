One team that hasn’t been involved Sunday is the Boston Celtics, even though they’ve been linked to Cousins in the past. According to text from league exec, Celtics have NOT been one of the teams trying to get DeMarcus Cousins today. \n— Steve Bulpett (@SteveBHoop) February 20, 2017 \nThe Celtics have been involved in many trade rumors surrounding superstar players over the last year or so. Cousins and Chicago Bulls forward Jimmy Butler are two of the most common names linked to Boston. \nCousins was a Western Conference reserve in Sunday’s All-Star Game in New Orleans. He played just two minutes. DeMarcus Cousins told the West coaching staff before the game that he was dinged up and didn't want to play much tonight, I'm told. \n— Sam Amick (@sam_amick) February 20, 2017 \nIt’s likely going to be a wild few days for Cousins and the Kings as the Feb. 23 trade deadline approaches. \nThumbnail photo via Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:42:23.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
