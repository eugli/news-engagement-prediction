Another has struck New South Wales, with temperatures soaring over 47 degrees Celsius. \nA blast of summer heat has placed south-eastern Australia on the map as the hottest place on the planet. \nResidents of Richmond, on north-west fringe of Sydney, saw the mercury climb to 47 degrees Celsius on Saturday, placing the town within less than a degree of the title of global hot spot - Ivanhoe Airport in outback New South Wales recorded a maximum of 47.6C. \nBefore Friday, NSW had never had a February day above 42C based on averaged maximums in the state, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. BUREAU OF METEOROLOGY \nTemperatures soars in the interior of New South Wales recently with vast reaching hotter than 45C. \nMeteorologists were predicting NSW would set a state-wide record for February warmth during the current heatwave but few would have tipped the mark would be broken two days in a row. \nREAD MORE: \nThe state cleared that mark with 42.4C on Friday, as the incessant heat that has roasted the state's north-west for weeks drifted over the rest of NSW. ITN \nFires rage in rural Australia. The state's rural fire chief described it as \"the worst day we have seen in the history of New South Wales.\" . \nAccording to preliminary bureau data, Saturday's average temperature leapt even higher, touching 44.02C. \n\"We easily beat the February average heat record and came very close to an all-time record,\" Simon Louis, senior NSW meteorologist at the bureau, said. \nForecasters had been tipping maximum temperatures would be in the order of eight degrees above average on Saturday. As the bureau chart below shows, most of the state exceeded 12 degrees above the norm for February top temperatures. CLIMATE REANALYZER \nA global heatmap shows temperatures around the world - including an area of Australia over 40C. \nThe bureau is expected to compile a Special Climate Statement this week to assess how the current eastern Australian heatwave fits within the bigger bursts of heat over the past 100 years. Ad Feedback \nThe preliminary reading for Saturday could, after analysis, even pip the record statewide reading for any month, set at 44.06C on January 14, 1939. \nThat heatwave was part of a weather event that included the huge 1939 bushfires that burnt through more than 200,000 hectares and left dozens dead in Victoria and elsewhere. ZAK KACZMAREK \nFire authorities have warned this weekend's conditions were unprecedented. \nFebruary's previous record daily high for NSW was set on February 15, 2004, at 41.99C. \nThe coast and parts of the ranges were the only areas in NSW to escape high-30s or 40s on Saturday. \nSunday was unlikely to come close to the two previous days as a cool change was set to keep a lid on maximums for much of southern NSW. \nStill, more records are set to fall, including in Walgett. The north-western town sweltered in 47.9C, the second hottest level recorded in NSW in February. \nWalgett is also among towns vying to break the record for the number of days in a row above 35C that now stands at 50, at Bourke Airport in 2012-13. That tally will be broken within days on current forecasts. \nTemperatures above 47C were also recorded in NSW on Friday and Saturday. White Cliffs' overnight low temperature on Saturday morning of 34.2C also broke the 102-year-old record for the highest minimum in NSW for any month. \nNSW and other parts of south-eastern Australia were the hottest in the world on Saturday, according to the Climate Reanalyzer website. \nThe blustery cool change, which was sweeping through NSW on Sunday and raising fire threats to \"catastrophic\" levels in some regions, will bring a welcomed break in the heat for many, particularly in Sydney. \nThe city's maximum temperature will ease back to 27C on Monday and 24C on Tuesday - a rarity of a below-average day for what is likely to Sydney's hottest summer on record. Temperatures then start to climb back to the 30s for three days from Thursday, the bureau said. \nSo far in February, maximum temperatures are running more than four degrees above average, with similar anomalies for overnight conditions. This warm month follows Sydney's second-hottest December and hottest January in records that go back to 1858, the bureau data shows. - Sydney Morning Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:58:09.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
