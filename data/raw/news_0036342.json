Nikki and Jenn spoke with Montgomery County coroner Dr. Kent Harshbarger and learned some shocking facts about the overdose problem that is ravaging south west Ohio. With nearly 150 suspected overdose deaths in January alone in his county and 44 overdoses in emergency rooms on Sunday alone, Dr. Harshbarger’s office cannot handle the workload and have been forced to use mass disaster equipment and funeral homes as additional facilities. { \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"show\", \"id\" : 26914500, \"name\" : \"Deeper with Sixx Sense: Interviews\", \"description\" : \"Sixx Sense with Nikki Sixx Interviews\", \"slug\" : \"139-Deeper-with-Sixx-Sense-Int\" } } \nThe need for education and community outreach is needed more than ever. In the interview, Dr. Harshbarger talks about the rise of fentanyl overdoses, where the deadly heroin substitute comes from, how more people are tricked into purchasing it, and why it passes as a “stronger” product. He also revealed that the count has shot up from 220 deaths in 2013 up to 355 deaths in 2016 in Montgomery County, with a total of 900 deaths from overdoses coming through his office. \nMost importantly, we find out the best way the public can help. While it may seem obvious, educating the community on the dangers of the drug and finding help for family and friends who are struggling is the most effective method. \nIf you or anyone you know is struggling with addiction in Ohio, please contact the Mental Health & Addiction Services of Ohio here . \nPhoto Credit: Getty There's no one in the world quite like Nikki Sixx, and there's nothing on the radio quite like his show \"Sixx Sense.\" Each night, he'll be talking about the music and topics on everybody's mind, but filtered through the unique perspective and attitude of someone who has seen it all, done it all, and is still hungry for more.
