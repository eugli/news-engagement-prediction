President Rodrigo Duterte launches the Philippines' chairmanship of ASEAN in the presence of diplomats from Southeast Asian countries. Malacañang photo \n  Malacañang reacted to Southeast Asian lawmakers' opposition to the revival of the death penalty in the Philippines, arguing that capital punishment is an appropriate measure for the country. \n\"While some countries may have their opinion, we find the move to reimpose death penalty, reserved for certain heinous crimes, as apt for exercising discipline in a culture that now treats adherence to law an option rather than a rule of community life,\" said Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella in a statement on Wednesday, February 15. \nNine members of the Cambodian Parliament and 6 from the Malaysian Parliament signed a solidarity statement opposing the planned reimposition of capital punishment , a measure strongly supported by President Rodrigo Duterte. \nThe Cambodian and Malaysian lawmakers called the death penalty a \"barbaric and outdated form of punishment\" and one that \"puts the Philippines' internatonal credibility at risk.\" \nDespite the criticism, the Palace said   \"remains a priority legislative measure.\" \nIt pointed out that several other Southeast Asian countries, like Singapore, continue to impose the death penalty in order to deter crime. \nThe Senate, however, is not keen on approving the measure. (READ: House opposition: Pointless to push for death penalty if Senate rejects it ) \nLast February 10, Duterte reiterated his support for the reimposition of capital punishment, saying that government statistics prove it is an effective deterrent against crime. \nThe Philippine President, elected partly for his hardline stance against crime and drugs, said he also believes the death penalty is the only fitting punishment for certain crimes. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
