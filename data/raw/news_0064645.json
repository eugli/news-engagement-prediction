Source: Tweet \nA spate of injuries and heavy legs forced Aloisi to turn to his youngsters in Tuesday night's AFC Champions League clash against Muangthong United, and they didn't disappoint. \nRookie defender Cameron Crestani was outstanding in his senior starting debut, 18-year-old striker Nick D'Agostino was desperately unlucky not to bag his first goal in the senior side, utility Dane Ingham was again serviceable and second-half substitute Joey Caletti helped change the game as the Roar fought out a 0-0 draw against the Thai Premier League champions at Suncorp Stadium. \nAll would be unfamiliar names to A-League audiences simply because they haven't had much of a chance to play, with so many senior players ahead of them in Brisbane's pecking order. \nBut none have looked out of place, suggesting there is more than enough depth bubbling under the surface in Australian football to fill out more A-League teams. Rotated Roar open ACL account with stalemate A depleted Brisbane Roar have kicked off their AFC Champions League campaign with a scoreless draw against Muangthong United at Suncorp Stadium. \n\"We all know there needs to be more teams in the league, and the expansion, and giving young players an opportunity,\" Aloisi said. \n\"We're lucky enough we're able to give them an opportunity now. They showed they've got a big future and we're fortunate to have them at this club. \n\"Just make sure you make Champions League and get a schedule like we have, and then you'll get to play your younger players.\" \nStanthorpe product Crestani, 20, was arguably the pick of the bunch, helping contain Muangthong's star-studded frontline alongside stand-in captain Jade North and goalkeeper Jamie Young, who made a string of key saves. The Aloisi gamble that looks set to pay huge Roar dividends John Aloisi's bold gamble in leaving four Brisbane Roar players at home to prepare for Saturday's A-League battle against Melbourne City instead of travelling to China for their AFC Champions League qualifier looks set to pay off big time. \n\"Country boy. He's hard. He comes from a good family,\" Aloisi said. \"He's had to wait for a long time for his opportunity. \n\"He's a good leader - from the sideline I could hear Cam was revving up our players and coaching out there. \n\"It's great to see, when a young player who's just burst onto the scene and he's the one that's trying to get everyone going.\" \nMore opportunities could beckon on Saturday night against Wellington Phoenix, with sidelined trio Matt McKay (broken nose), Thomas Kristensen (hamstring) and Luke DeVere (calf) no certainty to return. \n\"It's great for our squad. The other players know they need to perform each week because there's a younger player there ready and we know how good they are,\" Aloisi said.
