But it’s a whole lot easier to imagine President Donald Trump siding with local TV’s breathless scare-mongers than dyeing his ridiculous “hair” black, and having feelings to Jawbreaker songs. No way Trump listens to emo. \nYet a new music video from Super Deluxe , “Donald Trump’s Tweets as an Early 2000s Emo Song,” gamely tries to do just that. “We noticed that @realdonaldtrump’s tweets are basically the lyrics to an early 2000s emo song, so we turned them into one,” the Super Deluxe crew explained (where else) in a tweet . The song is a strange caricature of early ’00s emo, with earnestly whiney jangle giving way to screaming and surprisingly heavy drums. The template seems to be more newer-school emo like Hawthorne Heights than halcyon-days bands like the Get Up Kids , Jimmy Eat World , or the Promise Ring . And Trump’s uniquely awkward syntax in tweets about “voter fraud” or, yes, “fake news” ain’t exactly Rainer Maria lyrics. (Though Trump’s “Meryl Streep” reference does bring to mind the time the Ataris serenaded Claire Danes .) \nDespite, or maybe because of how, how clunky it would be as an actual emo song, the result is a pretty hilarious comedy song. Producer, performer, and arranger Nick Lutsko has done this with Super Deluxe before , spoofing Trump’s campaign-trail tweets over sunny melodies more reminiscent of Saves the Day . But this time it’s serious, and it’s not impossible to imagine the resigned voice of, say, the Jealous Sound / Knapsack ’s Blair Shehan sighing, as Lutsko does here, “I call my own shots.” The lyric/tweet continues, “largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it.” Complaining about data isn’t very emo, but hearing Trump, of all people, cite the so-called facts, can make anyone emotional. Death Cab’s manager once joked that emo alarmism is how “we got George Bush elected twice.” Ha, ha, sniffle, sob.
