He was 83. Axelrod began working at Capitol Records in the early ‘60s as a producer and A&R person. He worked on a number of jazz and soul records by artists like Cannonball Adderley, Lou Rawls, and the Electric Prunes, and was sampled prominently by DJ Shadow (“Midnight in a Perfect World”), Lauryn Hill (“Every Ghetto, Every City”), Dr. Dre (“The Next Episode”), De La Soul (“I Am I Be”), and others. Shadow, Questlove, El-P, and Flying Lotus were among the artists who mourned Axelrod on social media after his passing. \nAxelrod also had a long career as a solo artist, releasing two William Blake-inspired records—1968’s Song of Innocence and 1969’s Songs of Experience— and more environmentally-focused work like 1970’s Earth Rot . After taking a hiatus from recording in 1980, Axelrod’s music would surface as a major influence on dance and hip-hop acts. A retrospective compilation, 1968 to 1970: An Axelrod Anthology , was released in 1999. \n“I’ve had such a great life. It’s just been one great adventure,” Axelrod said in a 2001 interview , “Maybe I haven’t left big footsteps, but I’ve left something. People all over the world seem to be listening to my music. So, what the hell?” \nDJ Shadow shared this statement with Pitchfork: \nDavid Axelrod was not a familiar name to most vinyl enthusiasts when I first discovered his music in 1989 (through a sealed copy of his classic LP \"Song Of Innocence.\") Perhaps it's because he wasn't interested in seeking the zeitgeist of fame; indeed, during his most productive era between the mid '60s and mid '70s, he was essentially a workaday producer, seemingly content to lend his energies into making others sound better. What separates him from his contemporaries in striking fashion is that he refused to specialize, and was willing to tackle a wide breadth of genres in an era when most producers strove to establish brand recognition within the rock, jazz, or vocal field. Axelrod did them all, usually with best friend H.B. Barnum arranging: Soul (Lou Rawls), jazz (Cannonball Adderly), pop (David McCallum), even hard rock (Hardwater). \nOf course it was through his solo albums that he wielded his greatest potency. Albums like \"Songs Of Experience\" (1969) and \"Earth Rot\" (1970) were challenging, intellectual social critiques and meditations on the failures of man disguised as easy-listening (On the latter point, perhaps this is why it took so long for collectors to recognize their brilliance.) As a producer just beginning to chart my path, I was hugely inspired by the audaciousness of the subject matter, and the sober singularity of his musical vision. He urged L.A.'s finest session players to create a melancholic world which felt like my world, and reflected the dread and disappointment society inevitably inspires in its emotionally vulnerable. \nDavid Axelrod's output remains totally unique and uncommonly cohesive, which is a testament to his vision as a composer. As a producer, I count him as one of my biggest influences. He is missed and loved by all of his family, friends, and fans. \n-DJ Shadow, February 6 A photo posted by Questlove Gomez (@questlove) on Feb 5, 2017 at 3:51pm PST Producer and composer extraordinaire David Axelrod has passed. Listening to \"Songs Of Experience\" on repeat for the remainder of the day. — DJ Shadow (@djshadow) February 6, 2017 I'll never forget meeting him for the first time in 1998. We asked him to do a remix for \"Rabbit In Your Headlights\" off the Unkle album. — DJ Shadow (@djshadow) February 6, 2017 David could be incredibly intimidating, & he did not suffer fools...but if he liked & respected you, he was the most loyal friend on earth. — DJ Shadow (@djshadow) February 6, 2017 So honored to have known you David, you are a bonafide hero to an entire generation of hip-hop kids and musical dreamers. Miss you Axe!!! — DJ Shadow (@djshadow) February 6, 2017 RIP to the great David Axelrod. https://t.co/6Qg5asMMEC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:47:45.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
