But in the next breath, the compliment was confused by Adele’s strained relationship with her father in real life. \n“Thank you to my manager because the comeback, as it were, was completely masterminded by him.

That doesn’t mean a lot.” Related \nThe Grammy champion’s father has been the subject of U.K. tabloid fodder for some time; he reportedly left Adele and her mother when the singer was around three years old. \nAdele clarified in her speech: “I love you like I would love my dad.” \nAdele swept the categories she was nominated in during the 2017 Grammys, including song of the year, record of the year and album of the year. Adele also took time during her speech to thank Beyonce , who had been touted as her main competition. Just as the “Lemonade” artist’s performance centered on motherhood, Adele kept with the familial theme as she told Beyonce, “I want you to be my mommy.” \nWatch the video of Adele’s speech below: Filed Under: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:45:47.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
