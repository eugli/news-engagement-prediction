We’ve got a lot of new faces, some young faces, good players, and this worked out perfectly. We got some wins, we got a lot of guys some work, we got a lot of freshmen some experience, and we had a lot of success behind it. Tennessee freshman outfielder Justin Ammons (Photo: Tennessee Athletics, UTSports.com) \n“Now we’ll go home, and we don’t play until next weekend at home, and I think we’re gonna go home a pretty confident bunch, which has probably been lacking in this program for a long, long time.” \nA Tennessee offense with a few familiar faces — including senior second baseman Jeff Moberg, senior third baseman Jordan Rodgers, junior center fielder Brodie Leftridge and junior catcher Benito Santiago — has been bolstered by a talented class of freshmen and transfers, and the Vols have pounded out double-digit hit totals in five of their first seven games. \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .) \nDespite star junior pitcher Kyle Serrano still finishing up his recovery from Tommy John Surgery and big sophomore left-hander Zach Warren struggling to find an early groove, Dave Serrano said he’s been mostly pleased with the performances of his pitching staff, especially big, highly touted freshmen Garrett Stallings and Zach Linginfelter. \n“You got to see a little glimpse of Garrett Stallings at the end, and he’s gonna be a very good college pitcher — and he already is, and he’s a true freshman,” Serrano said after the UC Irvine win. “And Zach Linginfelter, I really questioned bringing him back [in the finale], but we were light. Lingo’s gonna have a great career, too. \n“A lot of good things, a lot of little things we did this week and last weekend, and I’m just really proud of our guys.” \nSerrano said he thinks his team has earned the right to have a little swagger heading into next weekend’s home-opener series against Norfolk State. The Vols and Spartans are scheduled to play Friday, Saturday and Sunday at Lindsey Nelson Stadium. \n“Yeah, I believe they have [earned some confidence]. I think they have,” Serrano said. “I feel it in the dugout. We go down 4-0 early, but there was no panic at all. I think we have confidence in what we can do offensively, and obviously as the guy who handles pitching, I like that. It’s been a little bit better.” \n\nContact Wes Rucker by email at wesrucker247@gmail.com or ON TWITTER , or FOLLOW GOVOLS247 ON FACEBOOK .
