Note 4X is the same smartphone as the Redmi Note 4, in that it looks exactly the same, but it has its fair share of differences. Also Read: Xiaomi Mi 5C could come with a Pinecone chipset and not a Snapdragon \nBut its light Sea Green color, as spotted by Playfuldroid is not very common for a smartphone, not only among Xiaomi's lineup but for smartphone maker. Guess the company feels the consumers had their fair share of Gold and Silver. The black colour variant is also touted alongside the Green. \nXiaomi had taken to social media website Weibo (via GSM Arena ) to announce that it is, indeed, launching the Redmi Note 4X on Valentine's Day. But the announcement is said to happen today while the phone will ship not before February 14th. \nThe Redmi Note 4X may come with either a MediaTek Helio X20 or a Qualcomm Snapdragon 653 processor clubbed with 4 gigs of RAM and 32GB/ 64GB of internal memory, unlike the Note 4 that uses a Snapdragon 625. Rest of the specification will reportedly stay the same as the Redmi Note 4.The Redmi Note 4 comes in two variants in china: one with 2GB RAM and 16GB memory, and another with 3GB RAM and 64GB memory. \nExpandable storage is also supported. Price start at CNY 899 (roughly Rs 9,000) and goes all the way up to CNY 1,199 (roughly Rs 12,000). The Redmi Note 4 has a full-metal unibody and a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. It comes with a 5.5-inch FullHD IPS display with a 1080p resolution and curved 2.5D glass. The phone is powered by a 10-core MediaTek Helio X20 processor.The dualSIM phone runs Android Marshmallow-based MIUI 8 out-of-the-box and supports 4G LTE (and VoLTE-ready).
