By John Hilliard Globe Correspondent February 26, 2017 \nDEDHAM — Can Amazon build a better bookstore? \nThe online retailer — which began as a Web-only seller of books, before branching out into computers, clothes, and other goods — held a preview of its first brick-and-mortar store in Massachusetts on Saturday at the Legacy Place mall. Advertisement \nThe Dedham store, with about 5,800 square feet, was packed Saturday afternoon, with a turnout that may have been helped by unseasonably warm weather. The store will officially open Tuesday, a spokeswoman said. \nThe new store looks much like a traditional bookstore. You’ll find sections for cookbooks, travel guides, and fiction. But other sections are based on Amazon’s years of accumulating data on which titles people look at and buy through its website, from its Goodreads ebook platform, and user reviews, said Jennifer Cast, vice president of Amazon Books.

Another local store is being planned for Lynnfield’s MarketStreet mall later this year, while locations are being considered in other US cities.

He said retailers are facing a changing market and customers want the option of buying products from either a website or a physical store. \nHe compared Amazon’s move to the business model of L.L. Bean, which once relied on mail-order sales and a single store in Maine, before opening a retail chain and selling its products online. \n“You have to give Amazon credit. They have had a great business model and they are evolving to further serve the customer,” said Hurst. \nAt the Dedham store Saturday, Kathy Heisinger watched as her daughter, Meaghan Siekman, and 16-month-old grandson poured over a big, brightly colored picture book on tractor-trailer trucks. \nHeisinger was visiting from Schenectady, N.Y. The family of book lovers was intrigued by the new store. “We had to come in to look around,” she said. \nEmma Cohen of Brighton, who was perusing cookbooks Saturday, said she usually shops online but being able to hold a book before buying it is important for her. “I miss going to a bookstore,” she said. \nHolly Davenport of Norfolk said she wanted to dislike the store because Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has an “unfair advantage” as a retailer, but she said she liked the choices she saw Saturday and said she was considering a purchase. \n“I feel terrible,” Davenport joked, comparing Bezos to Genghis Khan for Amazon’s effect on small stores. “I may feel guilty when I go home, and may not be able to read this book.” John Hilliard can be reached at .
