The unexpected result is George being replaced by a better version of himself. The comedy will be told from multiple perspectives with intersecting storylines. \n“ Living With Yourself is a wonderfully unique, funny show that is both improbable and completely relatable at the same time, and it complements IFC’s slate of slightly off comedies that are created by and feature some of the best comedic talent in the business,” said IFC president Jennifer Caserta. “We are thrilled to be working with Tim Greenberg, who brought us a character in George Elliott that jumps off the page and then brilliantly duplicated that character so that we’d only have to hire one actor for both roles, the ultimate win-win.” \nServing as executive producers on the project are Greenberg, Anthony Bregman, Jeff Stern and Jeff Blitz. Blitz will also direct the first episode, which is expect to premiere in 2018. “I’m doubly thrilled to be working with IFC on this show,” said Greenberg. “Normally I'd make a joke out of a quote like this, but I'm too sincerely excited.” \nGreenberg is repped by UTA and Brillstein.
