This has lead members of the scientific community to fear the purging of federal climate data by the government. Wired reports that groups like DataRefuge and the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative have assembled teams of hackers, scientists, and students to start collecting the endangered data to save it outside government servers. \nTeams of coders are currently hard at work building robust systems that would handle the monitoring of changes to government websites. These systems are keeping track of what has already been taken out, because apparently, the government has already started deleting data. \nData collection is proceeding at a methodical pace. Half of the group has set out web crawlers for easily-copied government pages to send the text to the Internet Archive – a digital library that contains hundreds of billions of webpage snapshots. More data-intensive projects are tagged for the other group’s reference. This other group is referred to as “baggers” and they write custom script to scrape complicated data sets from patched-together federal websites. \n“All these systems were written piecemeal over the course of 30 years. There’s no coherent philosophy to providing data on these websites,” says Daniel Roesler, chief technology officer at UtilityAPI and one of the volunteer guides for the Berkeley bagger group. \nDespite the presence of hacker in the teams, DataRefuge prohibits outright hacking, so every time anyone hits a wall or “404 page not found,” they will need to legally dig deeper, which takes time. \nData that has already been removed certainly poses a problem, but it is further compounded by the fact that they don’t know when it happened or if someone else has already backed up the data. \nEmptied databases on climate change \nSome of the databases that have already been emptied include the Global Change Data Center’s reports archive and a NASA atmospheric CO2 dataset. \nPlans for the long run are already being put together by two dozen or so of the most advanced software builders in the team. They are trying to create tools that would monitor and filter out changes as well as updates to the government websites. \n“Climate change data is just the tip of the iceberg,” says Eric Kansa, an anthropologist who manages archaeological data archiving for the non-profit group Open Context. “There are a huge number of other datasets being threatened, with cultural, historical, sociological information.” \nIt is hoped that these dedicated individuals will be able to save most of the endangered data as these databases hold valuable insight into the current status of global climate change.
