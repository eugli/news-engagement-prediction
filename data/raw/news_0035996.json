Members Sign In A Jewish reporter got to ask Trump a question. It didn’t go well. Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Jake Turx, a Jewish reporter for Ami Magazine, asked President Donald Trump a question on Feb. 16. By Laurie Goldstein New York Times February 18, 2017 \nJake Turx is a newly minted White House correspondent for a publication that has never before had a seat in the White House press corps: Ami Magazine, an Orthodox Jewish weekly based in Brooklyn, New York. He is a singular presence in the briefing room: a young Hasidic Jew with side curls tucked behind his ears and a skullcap embroidered with his Twitter handle. \nWhen President Donald Trump called on him at a news conference Thursday, saying he was looking for a “friendly reporter,” Turx was prepared. He had spent an hour crafting a question about a recent surge of anti-Semitism, with a preamble that he hoped would convey his supportive disposition toward Trump. Advertisement \nBut the exchange did not go the way he expected. A few hours later, with the clip replaying on social media and Jewish groups issuing news releases, Turx, 30, was still reeling. He said in a telephone interview, “Regretfully, today was a day I wish we could have done over.” \nHis editor, Rabbi Yitzchok Frankfurter, watched aghast from the magazine’s offices as his young correspondent received a tongue-lashing from the president: “It was a very disheartening moment for us, to watch him being berated.” Get Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

We understand that you have Jewish grandchildren. You are their zayde,” which is Yiddish for “grandfather” and often a word of great affection. \nAt that Trump nodded slightly, and said, “thank you.” Advertisement \n“However,” Turx continued, “what we are concerned about and what we haven’t really heard being addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it. There’s been a report out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks. There are people committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to——” \nAt that, Trump interrupted, saying it was “not a fair question.” \n“Sit down,” the president commanded. “I understand the rest of your question.” \nAs Turx took his seat, Trump said, “So here’s the story, folks. No. 1, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life. No. 2, racism, the least racist person.” \nTurx tried to interject, realizing how the encounter had turned. He said he had wanted to clarify that he in no way meant to accuse Trump of anti-Semitism but instead intended to ask what his administration could do to stop the anti-Semitic incidents. \nBut Trump would not let him speak again, saying, “Quiet, quiet, quiet.” As Turx shook his head with an incredulous look on his face, Trump accused him of having lied that his question would be straight and simple. \nTrump said, “I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me. …” \nHe went on to say that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, during his visit to the United States on Wednesday, had vouched for Trump as a good friend of Israel and the Jewish people and no anti-Semite. \nTrump concluded that Turx should have relied on Netanyahu’s endorsement, “instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.” \n“Just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is,” Trump said. \nAt the news conference, Turx was referring to a rash of incidents that have shaken many American Jews since Trump was elected. On three separate days in January, Jewish synagogues, community centers and schools across the country received what seemed to be a coordinated wave of telephone bomb threats that led to evacuations and FBI investigations. Other Jewish institutions have seen an uptick in vandalism and graffiti in the last few months. \nIt was the second time in two days that Trump was asked to denounce anti-Semitism and offer American Jews a dose of reassurance. In his joint news conference with Netanyahu, Trump responded to a question about anti-Semitism by breezily recounting the size of his Electoral College victory and then reminding the reporters that his daughter, Ivanka, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and their three children — Trump’s grandchildren — are all Jewish. \nThe Anti-Defamation League issued a statement Thursday that said, “It is mind-boggling why President Trump prefers to shout down a reporter or brush this off as a political distraction.” \nDavid Harris, chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, said, “Respectfully, Mr. President, please use your bully pulpit not to bully reporters asking questions potentially affecting millions of fellow Americans, but rather to help solve a problem that, for many, is real and menacing.” \nSurveys show that Trump was not the choice of the majority of American Jews, who tend to vote for Democrats and came out in force for Hillary Clinton. Many Jews have been critical of Trump for not more forcefully denouncing anti-Semites and racists like David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan who endorsed Trump during the campaign. Many Jewish leaders are also wary of Stephen Bannon, Trump’s White House strategist, because of the close affinity between Breitbart News, which he once ran, and the white supremacists in the movement known as the alt-right. \nBut Trump was popular among many Orthodox Jews. They were reassured to see the Orthodox Jews in his family and attracted to his hawkish line on Israel, his support of vouchers for religious schools and his promise to ban Muslim immigrants from entering the country. \nRechy Frankfurter and her husband, Yitzchok Frankfurter, founded Ami Magazine more than six years ago to serve a conservative Jewish audience. It circulates in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia and is one of several English-language news publications serving the ultra-Orthodox community. Ami Magazine comes out weekly and has three sister publications: one for women, one for teens and a cooking magazine called Whisk. \nThe magazine interviewed Trump before he declared he was running for president and did so again during the campaign. \n“We didn’t do a political endorsement of him, but I really wanted the president to be elected, and I do want him to succeed,” said Yitzchok Frankfurter, the editor-in-chief. \nRechy Frankfurter, the magazine’s senior editor, said it was clear that Trump was not an anti-Semite and that Trump “must have misheard the question” from the magazine’s reporter. “The president is very sensitive to such an accusation, and we find the fact that he’s sensitive to it reassuring,” she said, because it means he understands how awful it is to be thought of as an anti-Semite. \nYitzchok Frankfurter, whose parents survived the Holocaust, said, “Perhaps the president should speak out more vigorously than he has. He’s got a bully pulpit, and he should use it for good reasons.” \nAfter the news conference, Turx, a pen name, said that he had had conversations Thursday evening with White House staff members and that he and members of the Orthodox Jewish community were “extremely confident” that the White House would give “the proper help, guidance and collaboration” on anti-Semitism.
