Article continues below \nIn fact, they have lost just one game since Mourinho's return to Chelsea which was to Hull in the second leg of their EFL Cup semi-final. \nThat run has coincided with Michael Carrick's return to the first team fold and Paul Scholes believes his old teammate's influence has made a big difference in their form. Article continues below Wayne Shaw has been offered an incredible new job after his pie eating antics \n“He’s always in the right place, he plays his position brilliantly and when he came into the team from October onwards there were something like 16, 17 or 18 games maybe where they didn’t lose,\" Scholes told Goal . \n\"He had a big influence on people like Paul Pogba, he got the best out of him and Herrera. He’s just tailed off a little bit over the last couple of weeks but I still think he’s got a part to play.” \nThis time last season, Carrick's future at Old Trafford looked bleak as his contract was set to expire in the subsequent summer. \nHowever, one of the first things Mourinho did after replacing Louis van Gaal was hand the 35-year-old a new one-year deal. \nAnd providing Carrick wants to continue playing, Mourinho will be required to make a similar decision this term. \nBut Scholes thinks he has done enough to earn another season at the Theatre of Dreams. \n“He’s definitely worth another year, Michael. He’s not a player who burns himself out in games, he’s more of a controlled player, he’s a fit lad but he always knows where to be on a football pitch,\" Scholes continued. \nLooking in the long-term, though, relying on a veteran midfielder to glue the team together is certainly not sustainable. \nWhen asked if finding a successor to Carrick is Mourinho's biggest headache, Scholes was in no doubt. \nHe added: “Yes. There are players out there capable of doing it but that’s up to him in who he sees in that role.\" \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
