He added the dog went through the ice at that point and could not get back up on the ice.\n\"It's not safe to be on the ice,\" said Dunbar.\nDays of warm temperatures and rain have weakened the ice and the New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization is cautioning people to be careful as ice on the river continues to deteriorate.\nThe EMO is also warning there could be localized flooding with the continued rainfall.\nThey say river ice observers are on call and scheduled to be deployed on Monday when flows are forecast to be peaking. Small rivers and streams may see ice breakup resulting in rapid water level increases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:40:13.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
