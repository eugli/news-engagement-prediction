He was born in Belgium in 1910 to a Roma family that earned a living playing music from town to town. Photo The guitarist Django Reinhardt circa 1947. Credit William P. Gottleib Reinhardt started off playing the banjo in Paris dance halls. At 18, he lost the use of two fingers on his left hand in a fire, and adapted with a new technique. He rose to fame in the ’30s. But with World War II and the Nazi occupation of France, Reinhardt tried to flee, fearing that, as a Roma and a jazz musician, he would be detained and killed. Instead, his fame — and the popularity of an officially discredited art form — may have saved him. “The Germans used Paris as the base for soldiers to rest and relax,” said Michael Dregni, a Reinhardt biographer . “Jazz was the hot music of the time, so they all want to go out and see jazz, and Django was the biggest star in Europe.” \nAdvertisement Reinhardt lived through the war, dying of a sudden stroke in 1953. His legacy lives on in the genre he helped create: Gypsy jazz. Patrick Boehler contributed reporting.
