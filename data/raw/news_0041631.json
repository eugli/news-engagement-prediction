Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant (Getty Images) Sacha Pisani \nUpdated at 10:19 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 10:19 p.m. ET \nRussell Westbrook did his best to avoid talk about former teammate Kevin Durant as he turned the attention to fashion week. \nAll eyes are on the Thunder guard and Warriors forward at the NBA All-Star weekend in New Orleans, with the pair set to be teammates again on the Western Conference squad. \nTeammates for eight seasons in Oklahoma City, Durant joined the Warriors as a free agent in July, which fractured his relationship with Westbrook. \nWestbrook and Durant came together in a heated and emotion-fueled contest between the Thunder and the Warriors on Feb. 11. \nThe duo will suit up for the Western Conference All-Stars on Sunday, but Westbrook was not interested in chatting about Durant, instead redirecting questions on Friday. \n\"Man, you know what, fashion week has been great,\" Westbrook said when asked about being in a locker room with Durant again. \"You seen fashion week? You been paying attention to fashion week? Man, a lot of great-looking things at fashion week I'm looking forward to â€” new collections. It's been good.\" \nWestbrook, a two-time All-Star MVP, was asked a follow-up about playing with Durant and responded, \"Man, you seen the new Public School clothing? Crazy. They got the new Jordan hoodie with MJ. \n\"It's crazy, man. A lot of new great things with fashion week I've seen, man. What else is out? Gucci. The new Gucci stuff is dope. It's good stuff, man.\" \nDurant was also quizzed about Westbrook and the 2014 NBA MVP told reporters: \"I'm going to handle All-Star weekend like I always did. Get in and get out. Do everything I'm supposed to do, play the game and have some fun. \n\"I didn't come here to be any drama or have a heart-to-heart with anyone,\" Durant added. \"I'm going to enjoy my weekend, enjoy my couple days I got off and get ready for the second half.\" Watch This ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:27:24.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
