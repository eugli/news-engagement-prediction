Open to talent, open to creativity and open to people. \nâ€˜At a time when people want to have travel bans, we should talk about welcoming people. At a time when people want to build walls, we should build bridges. \nâ€˜At a time when people are dividing communities, I want to unite communities. \nâ€˜At a time when politicians are motivating people by fear, I want to motivate them by hope, and I think the great thing about today, particularly post-Brexit, people thought we as a city would become inward-looking and insular.
