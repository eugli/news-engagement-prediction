Picture: Clare Armstrong \nOpposition child safety spokeswoman Ros Bates attended the walk and addressed the crowd, calling for the Government to publish both the internal and external reviews into Mason’s death. \n“We don’t know whether the Minister (Shannon Fentiman) and her department have actually put in place policies and procedures to make sure Mason Jet Lee does not happen again, and that is just not good enough,” she said. \nMs Bates said Mason’s community need to know what the review says and what happened to Mason. \n“Today we are walking in honour of Mason here at ground zero at Caboolture, this is where Mason came from, this is where a lot of the child safety crisis has emanated from. \n“We want to see action now, it’s been over 12 months since (Mason) was in hospital ... and we still don’t have any answers,” she said. \nAfter the walk, Act For Mason representatives held a tree planting ceremony in the Apex Park in honour of the toddler. media_camera Activists want to ensure the case of Mason Jet Lee is not forgotten.
