Lawyers and judges were angry after seeing the trailer and alleged that the movie was defaming the judiciary through the movie. Soon after, a case was filed in the High Court and today, the court ruled that the makers will have to cut four scenes from the movie. The makers accepted the suggested changes. But now the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has ordered a few more cuts in the movie. The cuts are related to references to the city of Lucknow, where the film is set and a few other things. \nAccording to a Bollywood web portal, all dialogues that show Lucknow in a bad light will be removed. In the dialogues –‘ Lucknow kachahari mein koi cheez time pe hui hai kya? ‘ and ‘ Baahar Lucknow ke lawyer mujhe kya bulaate hain ,’ the city’s name has been replaced by the word – local. Apart from that, Lucknow has been replaced with Awadh in the dialogue –‘ Yeh Delhi nahin Lucknow hai .’ The city’s name has also been muted in the Holi song.
