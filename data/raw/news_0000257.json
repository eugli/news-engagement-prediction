Some WA academics have also called for work to halt immediately, saying the project is shrouded in secrecy and the environmental assessment process is flawed.\nThe Beeliar Group: Professors for Environmental Responsibility includes the former Labor premier Carmen Lawrence, who is a professor of psychology at the University of WA.\nPolice have arrested many people – including activists who locked themselves on to machinery – and issued countless move-on notices and cautions during ongoing protests at the site.\nAlso on Thursday, the federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, rejected a claim by the Liberal senator Mathias Cormann that $1.2bn in federal funds for the Perth Freight Link could not be reallocated by WA Labor to other projects.\nShorten said the same had been said about reallocating funds for Victoria’s East West Link but $1.5bn in commonwealth cash for that had instead gone to other roads in the state.\n“We’ve seen this trick before by the Liberals in Canberra,” Shorten told reporters in Perth on Thursday. “It was an attempt by the Coalition to blackmail people into voting for the Liberals at the last election.\n“It’s complete rubbish.”\nThe WA opposition leader, Mark McGowan, who has promised to tear up contracts for Roe 8, said he wasn’t going to give in to blackmail.\n“If we’re elected to government on March 11, we’ll make decisions about how infrastructure dollars are spent in Western Australia,” McGowan said. “All Mr Cormann is trying to do is help his mate Colin Barnett. He’s not acting in the interests of Western Australia .\n“The reason they won’t carry through with this attempted blackmail is because, if they did, they would lose [the seats of] Pearce, Swan, Hasluck, Stirling and Canning because West Australians will not stand for being bullied by a federal senator.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T14:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T15:50:48.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
