She was then asked what she charged as a speaking fee.\nConway, who had never been paid for a speaking engagement before, said she “froze” and didn’t know how to respond. She said she decided to borrow a line from the film “When Harry Met Sally.” “I’ll have what he’s having,” she said. And she was paid the same rate — $3,500.\nAsked what her boss is like in private conversations, Conway replied that Trump is “funny,” “gracious” and a “family man.”\nShe joked that the “biggest compliment” Trump could bestow on a member of his staff is “you are really high energy.” “In the campaign I would tell the young staffers, ‘if you see him coming around the corner start doing jumping jacks,’” she joked.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMaU06wpbyk", "https://twitter.com/mercedesschlapp", "https://t.co/q53epGoJxw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/CPAC2017?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls", "https://twitter.com/CPAC/status/834769816263143425"], "published": "2017-02-23T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:13:53.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
