Taking his wife-to-be Elizabeth on their first romantic date â€“ paua diving. \nThe beautifully-iced cake he and his SAS mates stole from the mess by dropping down from a skylight. The wild pig he and his brother Pete killed with a knife on a stormy night near Ruatoria when they were boys. Military jail, running the guards ragged. \nTurning up at his sister's wedding in ripped jeans, oversized shirt and jandals. Flying to recover venison without permission. NZDF \nSteve Askin's family at his funeral on Monday. \nThose were just some of the stories told at a moving farewell for David Steven Askin, who died on February 14 when his Squirrel helicopter crashed near Sugarloaf as he helped fight Christchurch's Port Hills fires. \nREAD MORE: * Helicopter pilot who died fighting Christchurch fires ex-SAS member David Steven Askin \nAbout 500 people, including All Black legend Richie McCaw, Victoria Cross winner Willie Apiata and Civil Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee, attended Askin's funeral at the Air Force Museum of New Zealand on Monday.

JOSEPH JOHNSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nMedals are carried to the funeral of former SAS soldier David Steven Askin. \nCombined with more conventionally glowing tributes, the stories fleshed out a man who was an exceptional special forces soldier, a careful but adventurous helicopter pilot and a warm, loving father, brother, husband and father. But he was also a mischief maker and a daredevil who loved nothing more than to be in the thick of the action. \nIn contrast to the spit and polish of the New Zealand army soldiers and officers at the funeral, Askin's brother Pete arrived in black shorts and bare feet. \nPete said he wore the shorts in honour of one their last adventures together when they walked along the coast to Kaikoura without provisions covering 170 kilometres in 61 hours. JOSEPH JOHNSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nPete Askin carries the coffin he made for his brother, former SAS soldier David Steven Askin. \n\"He was a helluva chap. He was a good man to have on your side and liked to push himself as far and as hard as he could. He wasn't happy unless he did something at least in the top five near-death experiences. Ad Feedback \nDeputy Chief of the NZ Army, Brigadier Chris Parsons, said he met Askin in 2004 and took an instant shine to him. Like many SAS soldiers, Askin was a free spirit and an \"artist in mischief\". \nParsons said one of his first duties was to save Askin's SAS career after the cake mission \"behind culinary lines\". JOSEPH JOHNSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nWillie Apiata and Richie McCaw greet other guests before the funeral of the former SAS soldier David Steven Askin. \n\"Soon after we were in Afghanistan and Steve with his superb eye for country, his motocross and four-wheel-drive skills, resilience, his mateship and his practical aptitude, well he was a natural.\" \nColonel Rob Gillett described Askin as the \"quintessential Kiwi mate, a good soldier and exceptional special forces operator\". \n\"Steve was a man more afraid of the parade ground, a fitting suit or shirt creases than any enemy unlucky enough to cross him. Steve struggled with rules and imposed discipline.\" SUPPLIED \nSteve Askin during an incident at the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul in 2011. \nElizabeth said her husband had made her a better person and was generous with his time. \n\"He always wanted to help everybody. He was everything to me. He was always encouraging me all the time. He was my rock. He was my future . . . The kids were so excited when he came home and they saw the joy in his eyes.\" \nSteve's mother Leslie opening by saying: \"No mother wants a dead hero.\" FACEBOOK \nSteve Askin was an accomplished and careful helicopter pilot. \nShe and her husband brought up their children to be heroic in the sense of giving to the community and looking after their families by making the right choices. \n\"Be a hero to your family, your mates. Wherever you find yourself, choose to be a hero,\" she said. SUPPLIED \nSteve Askin and his wife Elizabeth. They have two young children Isabelle and Bowie.
