Editor Advertisement \nIt has already started. Festivities and celebrations not yet over, City Gas have announced that the price of gas is going up, by almost 4.5% for every kilowatt. This increase is for the period from 1 Feb to 30 April, and the increase is due to the increase in oil prices. \nNot so long ago, Singaporeans were told that most salary will remain the same, and not to expect any major increase. But other things around us will increase. Things will just get more and more expensive now. \nSo much for a happy start to the year. Wonder what they will increase next. Public transport fares? Since oil prices went up, now is the chance to increase fares, right? \nPoor Man \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
