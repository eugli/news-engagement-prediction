And stumbling is what most were doing, in a daze of light beer and disbelief that the Patriots had overcome a pitiful first half to beat Atlanta and become, well, legends.\nFolks with the right laminates walked into the team party, a carpeted banquet of well-stocked food stations — fish tacos, sliders, breakfast burritos — and open bars. John Legend and a 10-piece band were first to the stage, doing a fair impersonation of the character Legend plays in ‘La La Land,” smooth but kind of inert. (Covers of Curtis Mayfield ’s “Move on Up,” and Michael Jackson ’s “Rock with You” were stellar.)\nAdvertisement\nIf Tom Brady or Super Bowl hero Julian Edelman were in the room, we didn’t see them — nor did we see Rob Gronkowski , who rarely skips an opportunity to take his shirt off.\nWe did watch owner Robert Kraft , Vince Lombardi Trophy in hand, stroll around an area reserved for players and families as the country act Old Dominion did its thing. And we got a big hug from Maria Menounos , who couldn’t quite believe what she’d just witnessed.\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond.

(We obliged, even if we didn’t have the jersey.)\nWe lost track of time and then Lil Wayne was on stage, giving props to the Patriots (while pointing out he’s a Packers fan and doesn’t really care about the AFC). He was soon joined by Pats running back LeGarrette Blount , among others, who flanked the shirtless rapper as he crouched through a set of hits.", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=For", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Fnames%2F2017%2F02%2F06%2Ffor-patriots-super-bowl-night-was-festive-affair%2FjmLyEd25Rr5QN3OYiFbP4O%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&media=//c.o0bg.com/rw/Boston/2011-2020/2017/02/06/BostonGlobe.com/Lifestyle/Images/c6b38290cc484664999dfa5450a72490-c6b38290cc484664999dfa5450a72490-0.jpg&description=Patriots", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Fnames%2F2017%2F02%2F06%2Ffor-patriots-super-bowl-night-was-festive-affair%2FjmLyEd25Rr5QN3OYiFbP4O%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tFor", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Fnames%2F2017%2F02%2F06%2Ffor-patriots-super-bowl-night-was-festive-affair%2FjmLyEd25Rr5QN3OYiFbP4O%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=For", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Fnames%2F2017%2F02%2F06%2Ffor-patriots-super-bowl-night-was-festive-affair%2FjmLyEd25Rr5QN3OYiFbP4O%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=For", "https://secure.brightcove.com/services/mobile/streaming/index/master.m3u8?videoId=5311683897001&pubId=245991542&secure=true"], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:28:02.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
