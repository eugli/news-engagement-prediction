And so, the orders he signed after swearing in Sessions at the White House revived his apocalyptic campaign theme of a country under siege by criminals, which is contradicted by official data.\nOne order said that foreign criminal gangs had “spread throughout the nation” displaying a “wanton disregard for human life” and had “been known to commit brutal murders, rapes, and other barbaric acts”. Another stated: “Many communities across the nation are suffering from high rates of violent crime.”\nIn fact, crime in the US remains relatively low by modern historical standards and had been steadily declining for years before the recent uptick in violent crime that Sessions on Thursday nonsensically described as a “permanent trend”. Earlier this week, Trump repeated a lie that the US murder rate, which is roughly half as great as it was in 1980, is actually at a 47-year high.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that Trump was targeting “national trends that don’t exist” while ignoring growing problems such as the excessive use of force against black people by police officers.\n“We have seen historic lows in the country’s crime rate and a downward trend in killings against police officers since the 1980s,” said Jeffery Robinson, the ACLU’s deputy legal director.\nStill, Trump’s executive orders will undoubtedly delight the rank-and-file members of the national Fraternal Order of Police, the nation’s biggest law enforcement union, which endorsed Trump after accusing Obama of demonizing them.\nEarlier this month, the group expressed its joy at the Senate judiciary committee’s approval of Sessions for the job of attorney general, saying he was “a real advocate for the men and women in law enforcement”. Unspoken, but clear, was their view that Obama and his attorneys general had by contrast sided with the protesters.\nTrump has also excited officers by promising to resume supplying police departments with heavy weaponry and vehicles that have been discarded by the Pentagon. Obama ordered restrictions on the program amid widespread concern about the use of such equipment against protests and riots on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014.\nAnother order on Thursday, on general crime-fighting, directed Sessions to establish the “task force on crime reduction and public safety”, which will identify “deficiencies” in existing laws and propose new legislation “that could be enacted to improve public safety and reduce crime”.\nThe panel will also be responsible for reviewing all “crime-related data” and for finding “measures that could improve data collection” to help reduce crime, according to the order. \nBut exactly what kind of “improvements” to the data would be welcomed by this president, whose campaign suggested that the FBI’s official crime statistics should not be trusted, remains unclear.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:21:35.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
