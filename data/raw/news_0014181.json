She added that she feels the criticism stems from the fact the show is made in the Philippines, where the culture is different. 'We value family and love in this country. It's a matter of respecting other people’s cultures,' she said. Piers Morgan previously said Xia's act as Taylor Swift, which she performed in a previous episode of the show, represented the 'sexualisation of young girls' and was 'not cute' but 'creepy'. But Christy defended herself again against his attack , saying her daughter's act was an 'adorable' bit of fun. She said previously: 'For Piers Morgan to say something like that, he's a journalist, he should know his facts first before he commented on something that he doesn't really know the full story. Xia is also given a toy gun and pretends to shoot at backup dancers, who are dressed as Scifi monsters Her parents, Alan Vigor and Christy Bernardo, have come under fire from critics for her 'sexualised' performances Piers Morgan said her act represented the 'sexualisation of young girls' and was 'not cute' but 'creepy' 'It's not really fair on us for him to say something like that because as a mother I will never ever put my daughter in a situation where she will be sexualised. 'The programme is within the context of a family-oriented show here and it's purely entertainment. 'Philipinos love the programme and it's for children. Children watch the programme and the prize money for the programme is to go to charity and to buy toys for the children so it helps.' Alan, who is separated from Christy but remains on good terms with her, previously told MailOnline: 'He's wrong. He doesn't understand the context. The culture here is very, very different. People in the Philippines see things differently. But her mother said: 'It's not really fair on us for him to say something like that because as a mother I will never ever put my daughter in a situation where she will be sexualised' 'On the show net week, Xia is going to dress up as Axl rose. It's like a pantomime. It's been taken out of context. She's not going a friend's birthday party in high heels and lipstick. It's not like that. She would never dress up like that on a normal day.' Despite receiving criticism, the seven-year-old, who previously told the MailOnline she aims to be like Selena Gomez when she is older, has gained an army of fans. On Twitter, she has more than 10,000 followers and close to 100,000 followers on Facebook. Her fans revealed their excitement of her newest impersonation in the days leading up to her performance. A girl called Taylor tweeted: 'Xia Vigor as Ariana Grande! Haha so cutee' while Aish wrote: 'Xia Vigor as Ariana Grande can't wait'. Lynn added: 'Xia Vigor as Ariana Grande next week. I'm excited.'
