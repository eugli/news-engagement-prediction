ADVERTISEMENT \nDuterte arrived in Baguio on Friday night (Feb. 17), but arrived half an hour late here for the homecoming program. \nHe is an adopted member of PMA Class of 1967 but is scheduled to be elevated to honorary member of the PMA Alumni Association Inc in ceremonies at midday. \nPMA Hinirang Class of 1987 is lead host class of this year’s homecoming. \nAlumni members were at PMA as early as 6 a.m., and were touring the facilities along with their families. \nMany also reconnected with former classmates or “Mistahs.” \nLast year, 1,912 graduates of the academy joined the 2016 homecoming. Because it was an election year, alumni officials issued guidelines prohibiting any form of campaigning in last year’s reunion.
