New research has found that 55 per cent of renters under the age of 35 report being discriminated against. Nearly a quarter of them - 22 per cent - said their age was the reason for that discrimination. \nConsumer advocacy group, Choice, will on Thursday release a snapshot of how and why Australians rent. The research is especially interesting for young people, with the data showing that housing affordability (or unaffordability, as the case may be) means people are renting for longer. \nFriend has been yelled at over the phone when requesting maintenance for the downstairs area of the last place we were in, it was the raw sewage,\" one respondent told Choice. \nAround 31 per cent of Australians rent their homes. That's around 7.5 million people. More people rent now than in 1995, when the figure sat at 27.5 per cent. \nHave you been discriminated against by landlords because of your age? . \nJust under two out of five renters - 37 per cent - are under 35 years of age. They're the group most likely to say they've been discriminated against. Only 20 per cent of older renters aged 65 or over say they've been discriminated against. But for under-35s, it's 55 per cent. \nBasically the stats say if you're under 35 you're 14 per cent more likely to be discriminated against than older people. \nYounger people face discrimination based on their age - that is, they're worried their applications won't be accepted, or that their landlords won't address their complaints, because of their age. \nAnd the less you earn, the more likely you are to face discrimination, too. Given many young people are students or apprentices who don't get much cash in their pockets - the stats are particularly bad. Fear of retribution \nRenters are worried that if they complain about their treatment, or about the state of their rental, they'll be kicked out. \nThe fear of retribution is real. \n\"Did not ask to get fridge or dryer replaced as that may result in eviction,\" another respondent of the survey told Choice. \nThat's because of the huge competition for affordable rentals in some parts of the country. So renters are worried that if they kick up a stink, they'll be booted. \nOne in five renters is on a rolling month-to-month lease, adding to the uncertainty. 'It's an appalling situation' \nCassandra Goldie from the Council of Social Service told Hack the fear of losing accommodation has contributed to a sense of pessimism among young people. \n\"Security of tenure in the private rental market is appalling,\" she said. \nWhen young people are renting you can be evicted at the drop of a hat. You can be evicted for no reason.\" \nHannah Gissane from the Equality Rights Alliance told Hack that more needs to be done to make housing affordable for everyone. \n\"What we know about the private rental market is that it's insecure and unaffordable,\" she said. \"For all renters and especially young people, it's an appalling situation.\" Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:24:28.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
