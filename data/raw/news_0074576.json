Article continues below \nAs has been the case so often this season, Mourinho and co were indebted to a Zlatan masterclass. The striker was in typically prolific form, scoring his 24th and 25th goals of the regular season. \nThat's not to say it wasn't a team effort, but Ibra's team-mates should probably have thanked him in the dressing room afterwards. Article continues below Twitter is absolutely loving N'Golo Kante's message to Claudio Ranieri \nQuestion marks were again raised against United's defence, with Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo coming under fire for the two Southampton goals. \nGabbiadini was brilliant, but it has to be said that United should have done better at the back too. \nRojo looked uncomfortable at left-back, but ultimately, it didn't matter as he still ended up on the winning side. Something's very wrong \nThe Argentinian subsequently went on to celebrate just as much as the next United player. However, there was something notable about his attire, and it wasn't going down too well on Twitter. \nHere Rojo is, donning a Champions League scarf. \nYou have to assume that the merchandise had just been thrown on the pitch by a fan, but even so - rather awkward. \nUnited fans hardly need reminding that they still face a battle for the Champions League spots. Mourinho's men currently sit two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal and four behind third-placed Manchester City. \nSuccess in the EFL Cup has at least guaranteed them a spot in the Europa League next season. \nThe club will still be aiming to reclaim their place among Europe's elite, though, not least so Rojo can keep his scarf.
