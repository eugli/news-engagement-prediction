Alicestine October, Media 24 Parliamentary Bureau 2017-02-07 05:30 National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete (Parliament TV) Related Links Opposition wants Mbete apology over ‘JZ 783’ \nA “Speaker’s Ball” is taking place in a plush Cape Town hotel on Thursday evening, immediately after President Jacob Zuma’s state of the nation address, but who is actually arranging it? \nThis question was passed between the ANC and Parliament like a hot potato, after it was revealed that an invitation in the name of National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete had been circulating. \nThe dinner, under the title “The Speaker’s Ball”, was apparently in celebration of the office of the speaker, but both the ANC and Parliament have denied any involvement. \nParliament last week announced that there would be no dinner this year due to financial constraints. The budget this year has been cut by R500 000, down to R4 million. \nContacted on Sunday, parliamentary spokesperson Manelisi Wolela confirmed there would be no parliamentary dinner or any other social event after the state of the nation address. \nBut he referred all queries to the ANC. The invitation to the Speaker's Ball. Contact details have been deleted for privacy reasons. \nANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said he had no idea why people thought it was something the ANC was organising. \n“I don’t even see an ANC logo [on the invitation],” he said. \n“The invitation says ‘the speaker of the National Assembly’ not the ‘chairperson of the ANC’.” \nMbete is also chairperson of the ANC, and her picture appears on the invitation. \nAnother ANC spokesperson, Khusela Sangoni, said that the ANC didn’t hold balls. \nThe ANC in the Western Cape also distanced itself from the invitation. \nThe contact details at the bottom of the invitation include an ANC email address. \nWhen the number for Gcinwa Magwaza – named as the the contact person – was dialled, a woman answered. She confirmed she was organising the event, but didn’t want to comment further. \nThe ANC is planning a “People’s Assembly” on the Grand Parade where Zuma’s State of the Nation address will be broadcast live on giant television screens. \nZuma is scheduled to speak at 7pm.
