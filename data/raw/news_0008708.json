(AAP) They might have failed to break their Suncorp Stadium drought but Sydney FC still have history in their sights after their lively 0-0 A-League draw with Brisbane. Source: Tweet \nThe Sky Blues' frustrating run continued in Brisbane - not winning there since October 2014 - after a fiery, yet scoreless Friday night clash in front of 13,095 fans. \nHowever, the Sydney FC juggernaut extended its unbeaten season start to 18 rounds - just two short of a remarkable record. \nThey are in sight of the best national soccer season start - Apia Leichhardt's 20-game streak in 1987. \nGraham Arnold's Sky Blues have made no secret of their bold plan to replicate \"Arsenal's Invincibles\" of 2003-04 and finish the season undefeated. \nBut they appeared to face their biggest test of the campaign when they arrived at their Brisbane graveyard - albeit against a Roar side without suspended striker Brandon Borrello. \nBrisbane adopted a State of Origin mentality in a bid to stop Sydney FC, even donning a maroon jersey for the A-League blockbuster. \nOverall, Sydney FC have won just three of 19 games at Suncorp Stadium. Trying to figure out how that ended 0-0... HOW?!?! #BRIvSYD pic.twitter.com/5t8l8CB37y \nâ€” Umair Ashfaque (@umairash11) February 3, 2017 \nBut the Sky Blues still emerged unbeaten on Friday night, extending their ladder lead over nearest rival Melbourne City to 12 points with nine games left. \nOne of the biggest scares for Brisbane came after Roar ironman Jade North copped a fifth yellow card for the season, ruling him out of their next match against City. \nThe defender was penalised for a 27th-minute challenge on Sydney FC skipper Alex Brosque. \nJordy Buijs' resulting penalty shot evaded diving 'keeper and man of the match Michael Theo but sailed past the far post. \nThe second half had a frantic start with Jack Hingert forced to clear a Milos Ninkovic strike off the line in the opening seconds. \nRoar talisman Thomas Broich's point-blank header in the 56th minute was saved by keeper Daniel Vukovic but the German maestro appeared to cop a stray boot in the head from Josh Brillante. \nSydney FC's Filip Holosko was ever present and Brosque's 77th-minute volley threatened to snatch a last-gasp winner only to be denied again by Theo. \nThe Sky Blues' Brandon O'Neill received a yellow card for his 62nd-minute challenge on Broich, ensuring he would miss their next clash with Wellington.
