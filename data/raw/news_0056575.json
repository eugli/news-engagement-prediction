Slot to Tennessee Links (Photo: Randy Sartin, USA TODAY Sports) \nTennessee announced Thursday that it will play a home-and-home football series with BYU in 2019 and 2023, starting with a home game at Neyland Stadium in 2019. \nThe first-ever game between the Vols and Cougars is slated for Sept. 7, 2019, in Knoxville. That game completes Tennessee's 2019 non-conference schedule, which also includes home games against Georgia State (Aug. 31), Chattanooga (Sept. 14) and UAB (Nov. 2). \nThe second game of the series is scheduled for either Sept. 1 or Sept. 2, 2023, at LaVell Edwards Stadium in Provo, Utah. It will be the first time Tennessee ever has played in the state of Utah. (What's next for the Vols?

BYU was founded in 1875 and began playing varsity football in 1922. The Cougars won a national championship in 1984, have played in 35 bowl games, won 23 conference titles as members of the Western Athletic and Mountain West conferences and have had 13 consensus All-Americans. \nThe BYU football program began competing as an independent in 2011. \nOver the past 30 seasons, BYU and Tennessee have won 254 games apiece — tied with Clemson for ninth-most among all Football Bowl Subdivision teams.
