Scroll Staff Published 15 minutes ago. \nAam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejirwal on Saturday announced that he was donating Rs 50,000 towards Manipur activist Irom Sharmila’s party People’s Resurgence and Justice Alliance for the Assembly elections in her state. I am donating Rs 50,000 as my small contribution to her and appeal to everyone to support her. https://t.co/9uEXT1uMn6 — Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) February 18, 2017 \nSharmila’s party has been trying to raise funds through crowdsourcing on the internet. Kejriwal appealed to others to donate to the fund. The party has raised Rs 4.5 lakh through its online appeal, PTI reported. “Online funds are transparent and normally political parties face a backlash because they do not have transparency in their funds,” party convener Erendro Leichonbam told the news agency. \nSharmila had launched the PRJA on October 18, 2016, saying it would contest the 2017 Manipur elections. She had ended her 16-year fast against the imposition of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act in the state on August 9. \nThe activist had declared her intention to set up a new party after her acquittal in an attempted suicide case by a district court in Imphal on October 6. “I hope I will accelerate my new mission to integrate with the people after my 16-year struggle with this [party],” she had said after the verdict. Sharmila will contest the polls from Thoubal, the home constituency of Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh, and her poll plank will be to withdraw the Act. \nShe was repeatedly arrested, released and rearrested on attempted suicide charges after she began fasting for the repeal of AFSPA from the state in November, 2000. The Act is enforced to bring under control areas that the government considered “disturbed”. \nAt least 215 candidates have filed their nomination papers from 38 constituencies for the first phase of the elections in Manipur , which will be on March 4. The second phase will be held on March 8. We welcome your comments at In a first, some of the finest Indian theatre can now be seen on your screen A new cinematic production brings to life thought-provoking plays as digital video. Published Feb 17, 2017. Print \nThough we are a country besotted with cinema, theatre remains an original source of provocative stories, great actors, and the many deeply rooted traditions of the dramatic arts across India. CinePlay is a new, ambitious experiment to bring the two forms together. \nThese plays, ‘filmed’ as digital video, span classic drama genre as well as more experimental dark comedy and are available on Hotstar premium, as part of Hotstar’s Originals bouquet. “We love breaking norms. And CinePlay is an example of us serving our consumer’s multi-dimensional personality and trusting them to enjoy better stories, those that not only entertain but also tease the mind”, says Ajit Mohan, CEO, Hotstar. \nThe first collection of CinePlays feature stories from leading playwrights, like Vijay Tendulkar, Mahesh Dattani, Badal Sircar amongst others and directed by film directors like Santosh Sivan and Nagesh Kukunoor. They also star some of the most prolific names of the film and theatre world like Nandita Das, Shreyas Talpade, Saurabh Shukla, Mohan Agashe and Lillete Dubey. \nThe idea was conceptualised by Subodh Maskara and Nandita Das, the actor and director who had early experience with street theatre. “The conversation began with Subodh and me thinking how can we make theatre accessible to a lot more people” says Nandita Das. The philosophy is that ‘filmed’ theatre is a new form, not a replacement, and has the potential to reach millions instead of thousands of people. Hotstar takes the reach of these plays to theatre lovers across the country and also to newer audiences who may never have had access to quality theatre. \n“CinePlay is merging the language of theatre and the language of cinema to create a third unique language” says Subodh. The technique for ‘filming’ plays has evolved after many iterations. Each play is shot over several days in a studio with multiple takes, and many angles just like cinema. Cinematic techniques such as light and sound effects are also used to enhance the drama. Since it combines the intimacy of theatre with the format of cinema, actors and directors have also had to adapt. “It was quite intimidating. Suddenly you have to take something that already exists, put some more creativity into it, some more of your own style, your own vision and not lose the essence” says Ritesh Menon who directed ‘Between the Lines’. Written by Nandita Das, the play is set in contemporary urban India with a lawyer couple as its protagonists. The couple ends up arguing on opposite sides of a criminal trial and the play delves into the tension it brings to their personal and professional lives. Play \nThe actors too adapted their performance from the demands of the theatre to the requirements of a studio. While in the theatre, performers have to project their voice to reach a thousand odd members in the live audience, they now had the flexibility of being more understated. Namit Das, a popular television actor, who acts in the CinePlay ‘Bombay Talkies’ says, “It’s actually a film but yet we keep the characteristics of the play alive. For the camera, I can say, I need to tone down a lot.” Vickram Kapadia’s ‘Bombay Talkies’ takes the audience on a roller coaster ride of emotions as seven personal stories unravel through powerful monologues, touching poignant themes such as child abuse, ridicule from a spouse, sacrifice, disillusionment and regret. \nThe new format also brought many new opportunities. In the play “Sometimes”, a dark comedy about three stressful days in a young urban professional’s life, the entire stage was designed to resemble a clock. The director Akarsh Khurana, was able to effectively recreate the same effect with light and sound design, and enhance it for on-screen viewers. In another comedy “The Job”, presented earlier in theatre as “The Interview”, viewers get to intimately observe, as the camera zooms in, the sinister expressions of the interviewers of a young man interviewing for a coveted job. \nBesides the advantages of cinematic techniques, many of the artists also believe it will add to the longevity of plays and breathe new life into theatre as a medium. Adhir Bhat, the writer of ‘Sometimes’ says, “You make something and do a certain amount of shows and after that it phases out, but with this it can remain there.” \nThis should be welcome news, even for traditionalists, because unlike mainstream media, theatre speaks in and for alternative voices. Many of the plays in the collection are by Vijay Tendulkar, the man whose ability to speak truth to power and society is something a whole generation of Indians have not had a chance to experience. That alone should be reason enough to cheer for the whole project. Play \nHotstar, India’s largest premium streaming platform, stands out with its Originals bouquet bringing completely new formats and stories, such as these plays, to its viewers. Twenty timeless stories from theatre will be available to its subscribers. Five CinePlays, “Between the lines”, “The Job”, “Sometimes”, “Bombay Talkies” and “Typecast”, are already available and a new one will release every week starting March.
