Katsuni \nThe artist formerly known as ‘Katsumi’ had to officially change her name after a court ruling against her, but this didn’t stop the French-Vietnamese star from doing what she does best, which is just about everything you can think of. According to complex.com, after collecting 29 international awards, this savvy vet turned to more mainstream work like dancing and doing TV (including her own show) back in her native France. \nAfter studying for a year at the Grenoble Institute of Political Studies, she went on to study literature in hopes of becoming a teacher, before becoming a go-go dancer (man, she’s talented). She was spotted by a talent agent for Penthouse and began her modeling career before joining the adult film industry, and the rest is history. She’s done over 350 films in France, before moving her God-given talents to the United States market. Merci beaucoup Katsuni! 9. Lucy Lee \nThis little vixen of Korean descent is known for many things including her sexy, seductive stare into the camera and whoever she is working with. Born in South Korea, she was an orphan who was adopted by a white American couple and raised in Torrance, California. Lee started in 2002 and is the recipient of many AVN awards throughout a lengthy career. She’s done tons of movies, but some of the more popular ones include Amateur Angels 12, Asia Noir 4, Me Luv U Long Time 5 and many more. You may have heard of them, or want to check them out. Just saying. Anyways, she might not be in the business anymore, but she’s definitely left her mark in society. Well worthy of a top 15 pick. Well done, LL. Legend. Kimchi! 8. Evelyn Lin \nThis Chinese-born cutie is the epitome of Asian schoolgirl (as is our number 1 choice on the list). She plays the innocent student that has an erotic dark side that drives her fans crazy. Nothing like fantasizing about a shy honors student doing very bad things, is there? That’s part of her aura and she’s used it to her advantage, helping to pay her way through college. \nThis hot little number from Hunan province in China started when she was 18 and has been in the business for 11 years. If you’re into pigtails and plaid skirts, you might want to check out her work. So the next time you’re day dreaming about a nerdy sexy schoolgirl who also happens to also be a total nympho, we suggest you look up Evelyn Lin(not that I have). 7. Nautica Thorn \nThe beautiful Hawaiian islands brought us this next Asian delight. The Japanese, Hawaiian/Puerto Rican adult star has done over 350+ movies in just 7 short years. That’s a lot of…work. She parlayed her success in the industry to land jobs on Playboy and Spice TV. Her seductive eyes are her main asset, along with her killer body, of course. She also plays the sweet, innocent role to her advantage, as she playfully stirs up everyone’s hormones. She knows what she’s doing(not that I’d know). \nFrom a young age, she knew exactly what she wanted to be when she grew up and had dreams of one day fulfilling her destiny, claiming “When I was a little kid, I already knew I wanted to be a stripper.” 6. Miko Lee \nAnother Californian of Vietnamese and Chinese descent, Miko was in the game for a ‘me love you’ long time. Her list of movies is endless and culminated in Adult Video News nominating her for Best New Starlet back in 2000. After so many films, she later transitioned to the role of filmmaker by starting Miko Lee Productions and served as executive producer for several movies including the epic Spartacus XXX, in which she also made a cameo. That’s some serious game. \nOver the years, Miko changed her look by getting a boob job, slimming down her face and dying her hair blonde, which is how she’ll be remembered most. Her scintillating work with adult film legend Lexington Steele really helped her jump start her career and put her on the map forever. She kicked some serious ass for a long time. 5. Lana Croft \nNo, this isn’t the tomb raider. In fact, she is the complete opposite. However, this 5’1 flat-chested Asian-American with Filipino heritage, also packs a powerful punch. Although she has a very friendly demeanor, she isn’t afraid to get down and dirty, just how we like it. Her weapon of choice is the timeless art of seduction, and she’s damn good at it. \nLana Croft was born on February 25, 1985 in the USA as Lilaine Camu, according to IMDB. She did everyone a favor by joining the adult movie scene before recently retiring to attend med school. You have to admit, she would make one hell of a nurse and would certainly know how to make her patients’ stay in the hospital a pleasant one. People would have no problem getting a routine check up from her. Thanks for the memories, LC. 4. Jazmine Leih \nThe last Filipina on the list, Jazmine was born and raised in the Philippines before making a career move to the United States. Another petite Asian, blessed with a nice rack and super cute face, Jaz was in the biz for 4 years from 2006-2010. At 4’11, you’d think it’s physically impossible to do some of the things she’s done on camera (not that I’d know), but she can definitely take anything that comes her way, literally. \nAnother actress known for her eyes and that seductive stare, which almost makes you forget about that 34C-24-34 figure. She made the most of her short career, producing a long list of quality films, which usually revolve around her taste for the dark side of the force. 3. Hitomi Tanaka \nKonnichiwa!!!! If you have a fetish for Japanese women and large chests, than Hitomi is your dream girl. Her breasts are huge. 46JJ, to be exact. And they are natural. There’s something about Japanese adult films that put them on another level and that is why they are so popular and the reason why people keep coming back for more. And Hitomi is one of the most famous in a super competitive industry in her native Japan, and that’s saying a lot. She started out as a model, before making the transition, and now has a cult following from around the world. Not only is she soft-spoken (such a turn on when they speak Japanese), sweet and innocent type, but her breasts…Unreal. If that isn’t hot enough for you, she’s also a karateka, and a black belt of the Gōjū-ryū style. Whatever that means, you know you want to find out more. Hitomi is a Goddess. Enjoy. 2. Mika Tan \nMika is like the Michael Jordan of the adult film industry. Not only has she been around for a long time, but she can do it all. Anything that you’re into, she’s into. Been there, done that and still looking hot as hell and kicking serious ass. Not only is she rocking hot, but she has a personality that sets her apart from the rest. Mika has a very outgoing, silly personality and always seems to be in a good mood. The combination of that pretty face and her boisterous, confident attitude, really separates her from the rest of the pack. \nThis Hawaiian is actually a Japanese, Taiwanese and Samoan mix. She describes herself as an “Asian mutt” and that’s probably why she’s so attractive. Honestly, there is so much info about Mika that we don’t even know where to begin. It’s better if you just check out her bio on Wikipedia or her website to get a better idea of just how talented she is. Take a bow, Mika. You deserve it. 1. Tia Tanaka \nAbout that Asian schoolgirl fetish….Tia is another tiny package that keeps on going like the energizer bunny. It’s not easy to beat out the top contenders from this list, especially Mika, but Tia is just so cute, you can’t help wanting more. Her innocent look, combined with her lustful taste for the extreme sets her apart. In a career that didn’t last long, Tia definitely left her mark on the industry. \nThis Vietnamese-French sensation was actually born in Indonesia before moving to the US when she was just a year old. She got into the industry at the tender age of 18 and was an instant success, winning many awards for her efforts. Tanaka retired from the adult film industry in 2008 and now primarily focuses on modeling for various adult websites. She’s so ridiculously hot, that I can’t even write anymore. I need to go spend time with my girlfriend before I get in trouble. Congrats, Tia! \nSources : Wikipedia; IMDB ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:32:22.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
