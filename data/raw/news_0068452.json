Their concerns included density, congestion and that the development wouldn’t be in line with the character of the established neighborhood.\nTheir opposition was enough to get planning commissioners to delay a vote.\nRELATED: Where is the planned Aldi in Roswell going?\nRELATED: City leaders say East Roswell can be metro Atlanta destination\nHartley, the man with the scroll, said he and his wife plowed their life savings into building a home on Ridgefield Drive in the neighborhood nearly 40 years ago.\nAt that time, the neighborhood was about 90 percent built out when the developer went belly-up and Peachtree Bank took over. The bank gave him a copy of the plat in 1979 showing there was never supposed to be more than three lots on the property southwest of him, Hartley said. That was key in the decision to buy his home.\n“Now I’m not an attorney, and I hope I don’t need to get one involved, but changing the game at this late stage sounds to me very much like breach of contract,” he said.\n(City planning officials said approving the plans for the new development would be legal.)\nEight people spoke against the plan, with one Ridgefield Drive resident arguing it would cram 18 homes on only 13 acres.\nHe proposed the city look at the aesthetics of the existing neighborhood, “which is more of one house per one acre,” and reduce the size of the development.\nBut reducing the size wouldn’t work financially, a representative with the engineering firm said.\nPHOTOS: N.

BECCA J. G. GODWIN/BECCA.GODWIN@AJC.COM When presenting the plans, Greyden engineer Ralph Davia called it a “straightforward subdivision.” Before the meeting, the city’s community development department recommended the plan be approved.\nBut after hearing public comment, Vice Chair Chris Foley suggested any decisions be deferred until the next meeting, saying the present plans seemed like a “violation of spirit” from what was originally intended for the property.\nTuesday’s meeting was one of the most well attended for a discussion involving preliminary development plans.\nThe high interest is likely due to the fact that the few remaining pieces of property left to develop in Roswell are in someone’s backyard, Planning and Zoning Director Brad Townsend told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\nThe next planning meeting is set for March 21 at 7 p.m.", "external_links": ["http://roswellcityga.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&MeetingID=1590&MediaPosition=&ID=3518&CssClass=", "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d6614.165386572111!2d-84.39301248376039!3d34.0160882652923!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x88f50d2a2a86044d%3A0xe0652e3ee262697c!2s1840+Ridgefield+Dr%2C+Roswell%2C+GA+30075!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1487605625599", "http://www.greydenllc.com/"], "published": "2017-02-24T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:56:54.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
