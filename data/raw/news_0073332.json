Source: Tweet \nMadrid managed to salvage a 3-2 win at Estadio de la Ceramica on Sunday despite being 2-0 down, but the victory was secured with more than a hint of fortune. \nCristiano Ronaldo scored the equaliser from the penalty spot, with referee Jesus Manzano penalising Bruno Soriano for an apparent handball after Toni Kroos' shot was cleared onto him by a team-mate. \nVillarreal were left exasperated by the decision and Pique - whose Barcelona team won 2-1 at Atletico Madrid earlier on Sunday thanks to a late Lionel Messi goal - was similarly unimpressed, going on Twitter to highlight previous instances when Real have profited in controversial circumstances this season. \nAlongside clippings of stories from Madrid-based publications, Pique wrote: \"Against the same teams. An 8 point [swing]. Those screenshots are from the Madrid media to avoid bias.\" Contra los mismos equipos. 8 puntos. 8 y tal. Los recortes son de prensa de Madrid por la duda. pic.twitter.com/nZUDgrjuVd \n— Gerard Piqué (@3gerardpique) February 26, 2017 \nThe result leaves Madrid one point ahead of Barca at La Liga's summit, with Zidane's men also having a game in hand. \nAsked about Pique's tweet after the match, Real Madrid captain and Spain teammate of Pique's, Sergio Ramos said, \"I would be surprised if it would be [Lionel] Messi [to write the tweet].\" \n\"But we already know about Pique's world, where everything's a plot against him. \n\"The referees have a difficult job, we have to try and make them more comfortable. Referees sometimes give you and others take away, but you have to be prepared for everything. \n\"We are not going to get into these issues because it will not change anything, the three points will be added and we will continue to be first.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:37:38.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
