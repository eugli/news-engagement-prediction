Kimmel is hosting the ceremony, while Damon will be attending as a nominee for producing Manchester by the Sea. Which prompts a question: will the two stars bring their long-running pretend feud to the Oscars? “I don’t know. I’ll have to be ready, though,” Damon told Vanity Fair at the Hollywood premiere of his epic blockbuster movie, The Great Wall, on Wednesday night. “I’ll only do something if he starts up something. If he starts any trouble, I’ll have to fight back to defend myself!” The bit began in 2005, when Kimmel began closing episodes of his ABC late-night show, Jimmy Kimmel Live, with a new gag: “Apologies to Matt Damon; we ran out of time.” With that, he inadvertently set in motion a notorious fake feud between him and the Oscar-winning actor. What began as an improvised one-liner gradually evolved into one of late night’s boldest and most entertaining running jokes. In the 12 years since the joke started, the faux enemies have hurled playful insults at one another and even tried couples counseling together. Damon took the rivalry to a new level when he teamed up with Kimmel’s then-girlfriend, Sarah Silverman, in 2008 for the viral music video “I’m Fucking Matt Damon.” In their latest sparring match, The Martian star showed up on the February 13 episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! claiming that he’s the father of Kimmel’s unborn child with wife Molly McNearney. To settle the paternity argument, the three appeared on an installment of Maury called “The Unborn Identity,” with Martin Short playing daytime host Maury Povich. As it turned out, according to the sketch, neither of them is actually the father; instead, it’s Tracy Morgan. If their troubled history is any indication, their fans should be prepared for some crazy antics on the Oscar telecast. Damon made a surprise appearance during the Kimmel-hosted Emmys last September to mock Kimmel about his loss to Last Week Tonight’s John Oliver in the variety talk-series category. As their bitter rivalry continues, will Damon ever forgive Kimmel for pretending to bump him from Live ? “Only if he lets me on his show,” said Damon Wednesday, “and apologies!” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:32:22.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
