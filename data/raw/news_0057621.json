This year, she is doing Nikkhil Advani's Lucknow Central starring Farhan Akhtar. The actress will be seen playing an NGO worker, who helps Farhan and his fellow jail inmates set up a music band.\n\nFarhan Akhtar \nDiana barely got 10 days to prep for her part, says a unit hand, adding, \"Before she started shooting, she went for elaborate workshops and reading sessions with Farhan and the cast members. She also met a few activists and interacted with women-led NGOs that work with prisoners.\"\nThe actress refrains from divulging details of her character, but says it is a story she feels strongly about. \"When Nikkhil told me about it, I instantly took to it. Playing a character, that holds her own in a film featuring a fine actor like Farhan makes it special for me,\" she explains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:28:50.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
