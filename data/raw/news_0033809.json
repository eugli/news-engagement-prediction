Till the end of the Bangladesh first innings in his 45th Test, Ashwin has 24 five-wicket hauls and seven 10-wicket hauls so far. He has also scored 1816 runs, including four hundreds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T09:10:21.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
