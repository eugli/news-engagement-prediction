They were almost home when their car was hit head-on by a drunk driver. \n“Knocked my shoes off. I was crippled, couldn’t walk,” said Sprabary. \nBed-ridden for months, she could not finish her last semester in 1946. \nSpraybary then married and moved as her husband joined the U.S. Air Force. \n“For years I’ve dreamed I was back in school studying for my exams and getting ready to graduate,” said Spraybary. \nThat moment came on Monday. \nLewisville ISD caught wind of the situation and organized a proper graduation with full honors. \n“Today is about never giving up,” remarked Principal Jeffrey Kajs. \nWhile it took her seven decades to walk across the stage, Sprabary is proving it is never too late to chase your dreams even if it takes a lifetime to get there. \n“Look forward to tomorrow, don’t look back at mistakes,” advised Sprabary. “Keep going, put one foot before the other.” \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
