Illustration: David Simonds/Observer View more sharing options Close Sunday 19 February 2017 07.00 GMT \nA small corner of Merseyside has become the centre of the corporate universe. Vauxhall’s plant in Ellesmere Port is less than seven miles away from Unilever’s base in Port Sunlight on the Wirral peninsula. The thousands of workers in those two places now face an anxious wait for the outcome of takeover talks involving their parent companies. \nLast week General Motors revealed it was in talks with Groupe PSA, the owner of Peugeot and Citroen, about selling its European businesses, Opel and Vauxhall , while Unilever rejected a $143bn (£115bn) bid from Kraft Heinz. \nIf both deals go ahead, job losses in the UK will be a genuine concern. GM’s European business has not made a profit in the 21st century and the drop in the value of the pound has made carmaking in the UK even less attractive for a US company. And 3G Capital, the private equity fund that teamed up with Warren Buffett to merge Heinz and Kraft, has a reputation for cost-cutting. \nBrexit is clearly playing a role in the proposed deals. The fall in the value of the pound against the dollar since the vote last June has led to writedowns on the value of GM’s European operators and made it cheaper for Kraft Heinz to launch a bid for Unilever . \nWhether the deals actually happen is another matter. GM has flirted with the idea of extending its existing partnership with Peugeot for many years and the deal is mired in political difficulty. The UK and German governments are uncomfortable with the idea of Opel and Vauxhall being sold, while the French government owns a stake in PSA. \nMeanwhile, Kraft Heinz has a lot of work to do if it wants to buy Unilever. The US company’s proposal was rejected because Unilever saw “no merit, either financial or strategic, for shareholders”. But Kraft Heinz indicated it was not giving up. \nStrategically, there doesn’t look to be much that Kraft Heinz can offer Unilever. Only 40% of the Anglo-Dutch company’s sales are actually in food and it has moved away from the mass-produced products that Kraft Heinz specialises in. Unilever’s spreads business, which includes Flora, is the only significant remnant of this and its performance fluctuates depending on the direction of the entire market. \nElsewhere in food, Unilever is focused on positioning brands such as Magnum ice creams as upmarket in the western world and increasing sales in emerging markets. In contrast, Kraft Heinz said in its results last Thursday that sales had fallen by 3.7% in the final three months of 2016, sending its shares down 4%. As for Unilever’s collection of personal care and home care brands, Kraft Heinz does not have much of a track record in this area. \nHowever, every company has a price, so if Kraft Heinz tables an irresistible offer then Unilever’s directors and shareholders will put these concerns to one side. The US firm’s initial offer was at just an 18% premium to Unilever’s share price before the deal talks were revealed, which is small by the standards of corporate M&A. \nAlthough the sheer size of Unilever will limit the premium, the Anglo-Dutch company clearly feels this price does not reflect the risks involved in the deal. Kraft Heinz is reportedly keen to use Unilever’s strong credit rating to raise debt for the transaction – its own credit rating is close to junk – and part of the deal would involve Unilever investors getting shares in the enlarged company, so its future success would matter. Both these factors should push the premium higher. \nThere are some factors in Kraft Heinz’s favour. Unilever’s recent row with Tesco about increasing the price of Marmite shows it is working hard to protect profit margins at a time when costs are rising and supermarkets are trying to push food prices down. If Unilever combined with Kraft Heinz then it would have even more muscle in negotiations with supermarkets, and the US company’s cost-cutting abilities would be valuable. \nA slightly higher offer could make seeing off 3G and Warren Buffett a formidable task for Unilever. Farewell, Williams & Glyn: your loss is a mixed blessing \nWhen Royal Bank of Scotland reports its results for 2016 this week, there will be another painful reminder of the 2008 crisis. The numbers are eye-watering: the ninth consecutive year of annual losses will mean the bailed-out bank has sunk into the red by more than £55bn since taxpayers pumped in £45bn to keep it alive. \nAnd a proposed deal announced by the chancellor on Friday – designed to free the bank from the necessity of having to divest 300 branches – has added to the strain on its fragile finances. To satisfy the penalty for state aid meted out by Brussels as a result of the bailout, RBS said it would need to take another £750m hit – indicating that the loss it reports on Friday will be close to a colossal £7bn. \nIt is a sorry story and one made all the more woeful by the fact that bailed-out rival Lloyds is on the brink of being freed from taxpayer ownership. \nPhilip Hammond’s proposal, though, to take a £750m hit and free RBS from having to spin off the branches will be a relief. The bank’s attempt to divest the branches – which were being packaged up under the revived brand of Williams & Glyn – has been fraught with difficulties and has already cost £1.8bn. Buyers have walked away: and after the Bank of England cut interest rates to rock bottom levels in the wake of the vote for Brexit, RBS boss Ross McEwan concluded the operation was not viable as a standalone entity. \nThe chancellor had made it clear that the uncertainties surrounding W&G, as well as a hard-to-quantify bill the bank faces over a US bond mis-selling scandal a decade ago, were the main obstacles to selling off the 73% stake that taxpayers still own in the bank. \nSo in setting out alternative proposals to Brussels to spend £750m injecting competition into the banking market, Hammond is removing one of the key hurdles in the way of extricating the taxpayer from the bank. \nWhether it will be good news for customers is another story. W&G was supposed to be a new presence on the high street; its absence will be felt. PM’s boardroom pay blitz promise looks set to fizzle out \nTheresa May’s post-Brexit vote pledge to clamp down on corporate excess and put workers on boards was to be welcomed. \nBut with the government’s consultation on pay closing on Friday, there is a real risk that the prime minster’s words will turn out to be empty. \nMajor companies will no doubt be allowed to get on with “business as usual”, despite the odd tinkering with the current rules that will be dressed up as radical reform. Boardroom bosses will keep getting pay rises bigger than their staff and continue to regard the odd run-in with shareholders at annual general meetings as a price worth paying. \nThe fear is that the warning from Stefan Stern, head of the High Pay Centre , will prove to be right. He is a supporter of publishing pay ratios – an embarrassment to boardrooms as the bosses of FTSE 100 companies are currently paid around 147 times the average wage of employees. \nLast week, he predicted that if bosses’ pay kept rising at the same rate as in the past, that ratio would reach more than 300 to one in the next two decades.
