(ABC Rural: Cherie von Hörchner) \nMr Clair said he had to keep a look out for the 'unexpected' when performing inspections. \n\"Nothing is typical and the defects you find from there can vary from blown light bulbs, a tyre being changed to a whole engine,\" he said. \n\"The daily inspections are the only typical thing. \n\"We can fit four aeroplanes in here. Comfortably, we'd probably have two in here … when we've had dust storms, we've managed to squeeze five in.\" From the land to the sky \nAlthough from a local station, Mr Clair said he knew little about the Royal Flying Doctor Service until he started working for them. \n\"I didn't have a great knowledge of the RFDS before I got the job here,\" he said. \n\"My family own a rural property — Limestone station, which is halfway between Broken Hill and Silverton. We run merino sheep out there and we've got a carob and olive orchard. \n\"I probably should have thought about it a bit sooner.\" Gyrocopter is work in progress \nMr Clair's interest in aviation goes well beyond the hangar. \n\"I've got a good friend here who builds gyrocopters. I just started to build my own, which is a work in progress,\" he said. \n\"The machine is probably a few months away from being complete and then hopefully I will learn to fly it after that. \n\"Once you go for a fly in a gyro you either like it or you don't and, fortunately, I got hooked on it.\" \nMr Clair said being able to use the gyrocopter on a farm is a bonus. \n\"It's mainly for hobby purposes,\" he said. \n\"It's not something I'll be flying everyday, like you see in some of the big stations that go mustering sheep and goats all weekend. \n\"It'll get a small use on the property — mine might get used once or twice for mustering.\" Photo: Dirt strip landings no problem for RFDS medical planes. (Supplied: Royal Flying Doctor Service South-Eastern Section) Working in extremes \nBeing an avionics engineer in the outback takes grit and some serious determination, as outback working conditions can be challenging. \n\"In summer it's scorching hot,\" Mr Clair said. \n\"There's not much airflow coming through the hangar. We've got a couple of air-coolers that you'll find me in front of.\" \nIn winter, of course, the opposite applies, but Mr Clair said the team improvised to stay ahead of the elements, and on the job. \n\"It's freezing cold (in winter). \n\"You'll usually find some portable heaters sitting in the aeroplanes and someone curled up in a corner there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:13:18.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
