Terrible!\" \nA Nordstrom spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter : \"We've said all along we make buying decisions based on performance. We’ve got thousands of brands — more than 2,000 offered on the site alone. Reviewing their merit and making edits is part of the regular rhythm of our business. Each year we cut about 10 percent and refresh our assortment with about the same amount. In this case, based on the brand’s performance we’ve decided not to buy it for this season.\" \nHollywood stars were quick to react to the president's tweet on social media. \"I often promote my daughter's work. But I'm in entertainment #PrezTrump not a Reality TV star anymore,\" director Ron Howard tweeted. \nSee more reactions below. I often promote my daughter's work.
