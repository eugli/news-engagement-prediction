Some have traced the crime increase to a surge in the number of refugees entering Sweden from Africa, Asia and the Middle East. \nTrump said at a campaign-style rally Saturday outside Melbourne, Fla.: “We’ve got to keep our country safe. You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?” \nTrump has made securing the United States from outsiders, particularly radical Islamic terrorists, a major part of presidential campaign and now his administration. \nThe president's mention of Sweden along with Germany resulted in Trump critics saying he had mistakenly referred to a terror attack. \nLast December, a terrorist drove a truck through a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring roughly 50 others. The ISIS terror group took responsibility for the attack. \nTrump’s comment at the rally Saturday follows White House special counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway mistakenly citing a “massacre” in Bowling Green, Ky. \nTrump’s Sweden comment was also questioned by the Swedish Embassy and Trump critics, including Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee whom Trump defeated. \n“Unclear to us what President Trump was referring to, have asked US officials for explanation,” the embassy tweeted. What happened in Sweden Friday night? Did they catch the Bowling Green Massacre perpetrators? — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 19, 2017 \nClinton tweeted: “What happened in Sweden Friday night? Did they catch the Bowling Green Massacre perpetrators?” \nFox News producer Jennifer Bowman contributed to this report.
