Kaweh Modiri says Forres provided the perfect setting for his award-winning Bodkin Ras. \nForres sits just a few miles inland from the sea at Findhorn Bay. \nThe town is known for winning Scotland and Britain in Bloom awards for its floral displays, its football team Forres Mechanics and Sueno's Stone, one of the largest and ornately carved Pictish stones. \nIt is now also a star of Modiri's first feature film, Bodkin Ras. \nMade using documentary-style film-making, its fictional-plot follows a man running from his mysterious past. \nIts lead, played by Sohrab Bayat, is a stranger in a small Scottish town. Most of the people he encounters are locals to Forres, who appear as themselves and not fictional characters. \nBodkin Ras won the prestigious Fipresci Award at last year's Rotterdam Film Festival, and has been shown in the US. \nThis month, it will be given its Scottish premiere at the Glasgow Film Festival, which will also celebrate UK films such as Lady Macbeth and international movies, including Catfight starring Sandra Oh.

Most of my visits have started or ended in Forres in Moray. \n\"Since 2011, when I started working on the film, I have travelled there frequently and always when I'm back I feel at home.\" \nModiri's first success in film-making was his 2010 short, My Burglar and I. \nIt emerged from the theft of his laptop. The thief was caught and the computer was returned to Modiri, but with some new files on it. They were videos the thief made about his aspirations to be a rapper.

But there are different layers to the town. It's as if you walk in through an idyllic park, that turns into a dark forest, that leads to the caves. \nHe added: \"I know there are other towns like it in Scotland, and to many people from other areas it might seem very familiar, but I could only have made this film in this specific town, with these characters.\" Image copyright Glasgow Film Festival Image caption The film festival and its line up, including Lady Macbeth, takes place later this month Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T10:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:33:15.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
