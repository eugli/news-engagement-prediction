As things stand, there has been some preliminary discussions. Initially, there were talks that he (Joshi) will be with the team before the start of this Test and stay on since there was a window after Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy's zonal leg. But now there are talks of a long term deal. So Sunil is in Hyderabad to look at what kind of contract BCB is offering him,\" a source in the know of developments told PTI today.\nThere is a chance that Joshi, if the deal is inked, will travel with the team to Sri Lanka for the two-Test series. The wickets there would certainly assist the spinners.\nHowever it is not known whether Bangladesh will require him at the end of the year when they travel to South Africa for a Test series. In between, there are talks of them hosting Australia.\n\"Since this Test match is over, Sunil will ideally like to complete his assignment with the Assam team. The Vijay Hazare Trophy is still left and after that he can be available if everything falls in place. Obviously, Kumble's words mean a lot to him and the Indian coach is very much in the loop about the developments,\" the source added.\nCall it co-incidence as Bangladesh play their first Test on Indian soil, it was Joshi who won the 'Man of the Match' award during the first ever Test match on Bangladesh soil back in 2000.\nIt was Sourav Ganguly 's debut as Test captain and Joshi had scored 92 and taken eight wickets in the match. Both his batting and bowling figures were his best in his 15-Test career.\nHe has also played 69 ODIs. At the domestic level, he was a legend having taken 615 wickets from 160 first-class games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:21:52.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
