Now she plans to slap the city with a $5.5 million lawsuit. (Sam Costanza/for New York Daily News) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  40 PM \nA pregnant Bronx teenager who was zapped by a police stun gun is expected to file a notice of claim Thursday, vowing to sue the city for $5.5 million. \nCell phone video shows an NYPD sergeant firing a Taser gun at Dailene Rosario on Feb. 10 in the hallway of her Wakefield building. She was screaming in pain. \n“Get off of me, get off of me!” Rosario yelled as cops grabbed her. “I’m pregnant! I’m pregnant!” \nPolice, who came across a scuffle between two men while responding to an unrelated call, say Rosario pushed a cop and resisted arrest by sitting on her hands. \nCop who shot pregnant teen with Taser was standing too close \nA draft of the notice of claim says the officers “illegally and without a proper warrant” approached and assaulted Rosario, who says she was 14 weeks pregnant at the time. \nThe girl claims in documents obtained by the Daily News that police fired the Taser at “too close of a distance” to Rosario. \nThe unidentified sergeant from the 47th Precinct was only 2 feet away when he jolted Rosario with the stun gun. \nThe NYPD advises officers to fire the electronic weapons 7 to 15 feet from the target, so the Taser darts are far enough from each other to create a charge that can incapacitate the subject, a police official told the Daily News. \nSEE IT: NYPD cop shocks pregnant teen with Taser in the Bronx \n“When they Tased me, it felt like my whole body was on fire,” Rosario told The News on Wednesday. \nShe said the police confrontation took place after her brothers got into a fight over a video game. The responding officers tried to enter her apartment despite refusing to produce a warrant, Rosario said. A police officer is seen using a Taser on Dailene Rosario. (Photography is Not a Crime) \n“There was no need for everything that happened,” said Rosario, a student at Life Science School in Manhattan. \n“I was already handcuffed when they Tased me,” she added. “It was unnecessary.” \nThe baby girl she’s carrying wasn’t harmed in the fracas. \nRosario was charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. \n“The actions of the police officers were clearly excessive under the circumstances,” said Rosario’s attorney Scott Rynecki. “The use of the Taser against a pregnant woman was dangerous and inappropriate.” \nThe draft of the notice of claim identifies one of the responding cops, Officer Taralena Gerrato. \nAccording to the criminal complaint, Gerrato said Rosario pushed her into a door frame after the pregnant teen declared that she wasn’t going to speak to the cops. Rosario flopped to the floor and sat on her hands as cops tried to arrest her, according to Gerrato’s account. \nThe Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating , according to a police spokesman who declined to comment on the notice of claim. \nGerrato has been with the NYPD for two years and is still on active duty, the spokesman said.
