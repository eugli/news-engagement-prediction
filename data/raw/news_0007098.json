This is data that belongs to the public. It is paid for by the taxpayer. We should use it for public policy’,” said Manning.\n“The Home Office view was that tracing illegal immigrants was a manifesto commitment. If I didn’t agree to cooperate [with the sharing of patient data] they would simply take the issue to Downing Street,” he said.\nHe said he was concerned it would undermine NHS Digital reputation as a “safe haven” for patient data and could deter highly vulnerable people from getting medical help because they were worried that their information would be shared with the Home Office.\n“We were supposed to be a safe haven for patient data, and here we were giving out information on thousands of people a year to the Home Office, without any transparency or oversight,” he added.\nThe new memorandum of understanding (MoU) makes clear the legal powers requiring the NHS to share confidential patient information records are contained in obscure exemptions in the Health and Social Care Act. The new MoU with the Department of Health published on Tuesday justifies their use, saying it is in the public interest that UK public services, including the NHS, jobs, schools and housing, should be protected from unnecessary pressures.\n“The information to be disclosed under this MoU is administrative in nature and consequently falls at the less intrusive end of the privacy spectrum, making disclosure easier to justify as the public interest threshold is lower,” it says.\n\nA government spokesman said: “We share limited information between health agencies and the Home Office to trace immigration offenders and vulnerable people, and prevent those without the right to access benefits and services doing so at the expense of the UK taxpayer.\n“Access to this information is strictly controlled, with strong legal safeguards. No clinical information is shared, and before anything at all is shared there has to be a legal basis to do so. Immigration officials only contact the NHS when other reasonable attempts to locate people have been unsuccessful,” they added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T14:51:09.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
