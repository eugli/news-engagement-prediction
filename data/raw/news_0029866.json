The incident happened at Lanark Grammar in Lanarkshire (Photo: Google) \nPolice and education chiefs at South Lanarkshire Council insist Colin had to be restrained to keep everyone “safe from physical harm”. \nThe Daily Record reported in February 2015 how Colin Jr had been excluded from another school for punching his teacher. \nColin who attends a special unit at Lanark Grammar - founded in 1183 and one of Scotland’s oldest secondary schools - was in a corridor when he got into a row with his older brother Keiran, 13, who is also autistic. \nHe threw a plastic drinks bottle at Keiran and a fight started between the brothers which resulted in Police Scotland being called. \nDad Colin Sr raced to the school after being alerted to what had happened. \n“The first thing I did was ask the officer to take the handcuffs off – he was clearly very distressed – and I put my arms round him to comfort him,” he said. \nColin Sr claims one of the police officers later said it had not been made clear to them the boy has autism and additional needs. \nThe cuffing follows a period where there has been a string of calls from the school about unruly behaviour on the boy’s part. \nBut autism specialists had advised Colin and Sharon to take a hands-off approach where possible, and let the school’s dedicated staff deal with any issues as they arose. \nAccording to its website, Lanark Grammar meets the needs of pupils with a wide range of Additional Support Needs, a term covering a wide variety of learning conditions from autism to dyslexia. \nColin Jr is always taught separately in an Additional Support Needs class but is integrated into the main school for assembly, school dinners and break time. \nColin’s parents say they were initially optimistic their son would flourish in such an environment, particularly given the school’s excellent reputation and high number of specialist staff. \nBut mum Sharon says she feels Colin is not getting the support he currently needs.

No complaint has been received at this time.” Read More Creepy-looking humanoid robot could help autistic children learn vital communication skills \nCharlene Tait, director of Practice and Research at Scottish Autism, said there remains a lack of understanding of autism across many community support services. \nShe said: “The reorganisation of Scotland’s police force provides an ideal platform to look at extended autism training.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T16:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:33:57.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
