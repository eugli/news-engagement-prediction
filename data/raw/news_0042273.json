The statue would then be erected in its original position, he said.\nThe colossus of Egypt's most celebrated pharaoh stood in front of Karnak's first pylon along with five others. Four of these colossi depict the king standing and the two others sitting.\nParts of the colossus in situ.

Their blocks were selected and placed in wooden shelters on the first pylon's western side.\nIn 2016, the ministry decided to restore and reconstruct one of these statues. Luxor governorate has supported the project by providing the materials needed for restoration.\nThe statue is carved in gray granite, weighs 65 tons and stands 10.8 metres tall.\nThe body of the statue.
