Over five seasons of the HBO hit, viewers have seen it all — Hannah’s break-ups, her make-ups, and yes, pretty much every part of her body. \nJust like Hannah, Dunham, the show’s creator, isn’t shy about laying things out in the open, particularly when it comes to causes she’s passionate about. And judging from her social media posts and interview topics, let’s just say she’s extremely opinionated about President Donald Trump. \nIn honor of the sixth and final season of Girls , debuting Sunday night at 10 p.m. ET, EW has rounded up all of Dunham’s post-election thoughts on Trump. Nov. 11 – Dunham posts a lengthy letter after Hillary Clinton’s loss \nDunham had previously pledged a move to Canada if Donald Trump won the election, but alas, she channeled her frustration into a newsletter on her Lenny site instead of a visit to immigration services. The letter included many references to Trump, as well as a promise to continue fighting. \nShe began by capturing the shock of Trump’s election. “Because as horrifying as I found Donald Trump’s rhetoric, as hideous as I found his racism and xenophobia, as threatening to basic decency as I found his demagogue persona, I never truly believed he could win,” wrote Dunham in the letter, available in its entirety here . \nLooking forward, Dunham attempted to unify and inspire people who oppose Trump. “Now, more than ever, our power is in numbers and in our refusal to accept the idea that our leaders intrinsically know what’s best for us, better than the people we meet every day,” she wrote. “In this new reality, we have all been radicalized. It’s no longer a word for those living on the fringes. It’s a word for everyone who walks in pain with the results of this election, who feels their identity being crushed under the weight of the half of the country who voted for a man who denounces and denies the basic rights of women, the queer community, immigrants, Muslims, people of color and the differently abled.” \nDunham continued: “We’ve been radicalized and therefore we’ve been deputized to do our parts. What that means will become clearer over the coming months, and we will all have to use the tools we have to speak for ourselves, but moreover speak for the voiceless, the people who can’t demand change for fear of very real and violent losses. Those who are gagged by the system Donald Trump proposes.” Jan. 11: Dunham spills on how the election influenced ‘Girls’ \nIn an interview with Nylon published just before Trump’s inauguration, Dunham revealed that the final season of Girls was written and shot just as the election was heating up, and the political climate managed to ease its way into production . \n“I don’t mean to be demurring, but there are some big female issues, more than maybe ever before,” she said. “It’s going to be interesting promoting this show right after Trump is inaugurated. The final season definitely tackles some topics that are complicated and wouldn’t be beloved by the incoming administration. Hopefully it’ll bring up important conversations, and not just become the worst Twitter abuse storm in history — or it will. The confluence, for me, of the show ending and this new era beginning in which I know that we as public women are going to have to fight harder than we ever have before, is a really interesting, complicated moment.” Jan. 21: Dunham joins the Women’s March \nThe star joined millions of other women in protest of President Trump the day after the inauguration. Though none of her multiple Instagram posts mentioned Trump by name, one post in particular seemed to offer an indirect dig: Dunham posted a photo with her “hero,” Democratic Sen. Cory Booker. “Real men wear @plannedparenthood scarves,” she wrote.

We love you. He does not speak for us. This land is your land.” A photo posted by Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) on Jan 28, 2017 at 12:33pm PST Feb. 1: Dunham argues that Trump’s appearance shouldn’t be mocked \nDuring an appearance at TimesTalks: A Final Farewell to the Cast of Girls , the actress appeared alongside her castmates and offered up some alternative ways to go about discussing the president. \n“All he does is talk about women like they’re objects,” she said. “It doesn’t reclaim our power to talk about him like he’s an object. It doesn’t reclaim our power to insult his physicality. We have enough cogent, thoughtful, philosophical [arguments] to fill a bible, so why not use those instead of like, ‘That orange piece of s—.'” Feb. 3: Dunham says Trump would call the ‘Girls’ cast ‘zeroes’ \nTrump’s critiques of women and their appearances have been widely reported, and Dunham and co-stars Jemima Kirke and Allison Williams recently joked to USA Today that he’d have a lot to say about the way their Girls characters looked. Read their hilarious back-and-forth below. \nKIRKE: I think while the [season six] story lines weren’t really post-Trump being elected, I think they’re even more relevant now. I mean, they could’ve been written in a Trump age in the first season. DUNHAM: Because the whole show is about women having choices, access, and bodily autonomy. KIRKE: Basically, everything Trump would vomit at if he had to watch it. DUNHAM: Yeah, literally he’d be like, ‘What? Women saying things that they believe?’ WILLIAMS: He should live-tweet our show. KIRKE: Like, ‘I got to see them naked? Ugh!’ DUNHAM: He’s like, ‘Oh god, these zeroes!’ Honestly, I think he might think Allison was, like, a seven. WILLIAMS: I’d be very flattered. DUNHAM: Yeah, I think he might consider Allison a seven, but definitely none of our attitudes would resonate. He only likes women who lie or don’t speak. He’s like, ‘If you’re Kellyanne Conway, it’s great, because you’re a liar, and if you’re my daughter, it’s great, because I’ve silenced you.’ Feb. 6: Dunham says Trump’s election made her lose weight \nIn a wide-ranging interview with Howard Stern on his SiriusXM radio show, Dunham said that Trump’s election win contributed to her weight loss by stealing her appetite. \n“Donald Trump became president and I stopped being able to eat food,” she said. “Everyone’s been asking like, ‘What have you been doing?’ And I’m like, ‘Try soul-crushing pain and devastation and hopelessness and you, too, will lose weight.'” \nShe further elaborated on the topic with a facetious Instagram post that included a schedule with items like “10 am 1/2 croissant before finding out DeVos has been confirmed. Washington Post app, nausea.” A photo posted by Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) on Feb 7, 2017 at 12:08pm PST \nIn the same Stern interview, Dunham said that Trump once called her a “B-list actor with no mojo,” and that, while it was a “mistake” for someone with his responsibilities to pay such close attention to celebrities, “we’re talking about him like he’s a person who is operating in a sane way, we’re talking about him like a person who doesn’t have a personality disorder.” Feb. 7: Dunham reveals what she’d tell Trump if she had a minute of his time \nDunham took part in Vogue ‘s 73 Questions video series, and said that if she had a minute to speak with Trump, she “would ask him whether he wanted all women to be treated with the same respect that he believes his daughter should be treated with.” Feb. 10: Dunham says it ‘pains’ her to see white women support Trump \nDunham stopped by The View , where she explained her “grabbed p—-” Halloween costume. “I felt like I would like to maybe take back some of the power from Donald Trump’s horrifying admission of sexual assault,” she said. \nShe also discussed previous comments about marching for the rights of all women, even those who voted for Trump. “I think it’s really important to remember that it is an incredible problem that 53 percent of white women in this country voted for Donald Trump,” she said. “Which means they’re not only voting against the interest of their sisters, of women who may not look like them, who they may not understand, but whose rights are just as important. Let’s also remember that they, in that case, are voting against their own best interest.” \nWhen host Joy Behar reminded her that the women may simply be after the jobs promised by Trump, Dunham attempted to explain their choices. “It pains me as a Caucasian woman to think about how many women didn’t think about women who looked different or had different life experiences than them. They didn’t look outside their own backyard when they made the choice to vote for Donald Trump,” she said. “I think it’s important to understand that so many women aren’t raised with the rhetoric of self-empowerment. The messages they’re hearing from Donald Trump may be very similar to the messages they’ve always heard from their fathers, their brothers, their husbands. They haven’t been given the message that they do matter.” Show Full Article ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:04:43.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
