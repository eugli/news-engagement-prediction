TOTO LOZANO/ Presidential Photo \n“Injustice was done to Janet Lim Napoles,” top government lawyer said Wednesday. \nGovernment lawyers led by Solicitor General Jose Calida   Napoles’ conviction for serious illegal detention for lack of evidence. \nIn 2015, Napoles, the alleged brains behind the P10-billion pork barrel scam, was convicted by Judge Elmo Alameda of Makati   Branch 150 and sentenced her to a jail term of up to 40 years for charges of serious illegal detention filed by Benhur Luy, her cousin and trusted aide.

Since it is a People of the Philippines case, the Solicitor General was ordered to respond. \n“The OSG ( Office of the Solicitor General ) is the defender of the Republic and at the same time the tribune of the people. I am a servant of the law and I took an oath to uphold the rule of law,” Calida said in a press conference. \nCalida said they reviewed the case of Napoles and found out that there were many instances to support Napoles’ acquittal.

It is my bound duty to state the facts,” he added. \nCalida said there was no witness that testified about Luy’s detention. He added that Luy was able to see his family and even resisted the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) which was supposed to rescue him. \n“So you can see the conduct of Benhur Luy belie the fact that he was detained,” Calida said. \n“Can your conscience say that she should be convicted?” he asked. \nStill, he said it is still the Court of Appeals’ discretion if it will consider their manifestation.
