The company previously occupied about 11,500 square feet in North Richland Hills. \nThe builder moved 130 employees to the building on Texan Trail north of DFW International Airport. Along with offices, the facilities will include a showroom. \nHistoryMaker Homes has been in business since 1949 and started more than 800 houses last year. In 2016, the company had $200 million in revenue, double its sales in 2014. The builder sells houses in more than a dozen North Texas communities. \nHistoryMaker also builds houses under the Rendition Homes and Rendition Luxury Homes brands. Its houses range from around $150,000 to more than $3 million. \n\"In addition to needing more physical space for more employees, it was important to become more centrally located as we continue to expand throughout D-FW,\" CEO Nelson Mitchell said in a statement. \"Once we began to expand in Houston, it made sense to be located near DFW Airport to bring even more efficiency.\" \nHistoryMaker began operating in the Houston area last year. The family-owned company was started by Olen N. Mitchell Sr. and three employees working out of the garage at his home.
