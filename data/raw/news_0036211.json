But this summer will mark four years since Brown, now 20, signed for Chelsea and he remains without a first-team start. He is one of 37 youngsters from the club currently out on loan , in his case with upwardly mobile Championship outfit Huddersfield Town.\nYet his wait to make an impact must surely be close to ending. With four goals in his past six appearances, he will face Manchester City in the FA Cup today aiming to further enhance his reputation and, perhaps, send out another message to the decision makers at Stamford Bridge.\n“I want to make a name for myself in this league first and getting a chance at Chelsea will hopefully follow,” he says, sitting at Huddersfield’s Canalside training ground this week. “If I carry on performing like I have been at Huddersfield, I’ll possibly get the opportunity to start pre-season with Chelsea. But I’m not looking into the future too much, I’m just happy at the moment.\n“I said to my girlfriend the other day that I don’t think I’ve ever been happier in my career. It’s an amazing feeling playing football everybody likes to watch.”\nThe England Under-20 international’s impact in West Yorkshire has not gone unnoticed by Chelsea and it already appears a shrewd move after his loan at struggling Rotherham United was cut short last month.\nIzzy Brown has impressed at Championship level with Huddersfield Credit: Paul Cooper B rown – known as Izzy instead of by his real name Isaiah – has slotted in seamlessly and owes much of his success to David Wagner, the German head coach who is also attracting attention.\nWagner is now known for far more than his long association with Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp and Brown admits he is broadening his education under the 45-year-old. It has not always been easy adapting to the Wagner revolution, however.\n“We’re in Sunday for recovery, off on Monday and on Tuesday it’s double training sessions. When I first came, my legs were hanging off on Wednesdays. We do the gym first, then 18 box-to-boxes in the morning, lunch and then some rest before position games in the afternoon,” he says. “It’s intense and has taken me a few weeks to get used to. Those double sessions don’t get any easier but in matches when it gets to 80 minutes we’re still running and the other teams are tired so you can’t complain.”\nHuddersfield manager David Wagner and Jurgen Klopp Credit: Getty Images W agner’s forward-thinking approach has been a breath of fresh air at Huddersfield, a club accustomed to annual flirtations with relegation. We are talking at 4pm on Monday and training starts two hours later, with Wagner setting it to correlate with their kick-off time at Rotherham on Tuesday evening.\nThe gegenpress approach, said to have been created by Klopp at Borussia Dortmund , and based on intensity, speed and aggression, has also brought the best out of Brown.\n“We always have to press from the front and make sure they can’t play out,” he explains. “If we lose the ball we’ve got five or six seconds to get it back. He says winning the ball back should be a good feeling.\n“He wants the best and if you don’t give it, then you’re out the team. I wanted to be pushed out of the comfort zone and fighting for a place. You can never be safe here.\n“Everyone has bought into what he wants. He’s a great guy and speaks to me a lot about the game, how he feels I can improve. He’s always asking me what me and my mum think.” \nFA cup 100 moments B rown’s mum, Kelly Sayer, is never far away from his thoughts and has been a constant mentor throughout his career. She was a coach during his early years playing for junior teams in the suburbs of Peterborough and drove him up and down the motorways to Birmingham when he joined West Bromwich Albion’s academy.\n“She’s my biggest fan and my biggest critic,” he smiles. “She comes to every game, even when I was playing in Holland with Vitesse [a loan spell last season]. Even if I score two goals she’ll be pointing out what I did wrong – I have to tell her to stop being my agent! But she’s been a huge influence for me, it’s all because of her and my grandad, they gave up a lot to get me where I am today.” \nBrown’s progression through West Brom’s revered academy ensured he recorded that milestone first appearance against Wigan, when he was brought on as an 86th-minute substitute at the age of 16 years and 117 days. But despite the promise of regular first-team football and a lucrative first professional contract, Brown left months later to join Chelsea for a fee of £1 million, agreed through gritted teeth at a tribunal. It is a move which still rankles with West Brom to this day.\n“I don’t regret the decision to leave. Maybe I would have had more Premier League games but everyone has a different pathway,” he says. “The manager at the time [Steve Clarke] was sacked early the following season and I could easily have been bombed back into the under-18s.\nBrown celebrates against Rotherham Credit: Getty Images “People say leaving West Brom was all down to my family but it was all down to me. Being 16 and supporting Chelsea as a kid, when a team like that tells you they want you it’s hard for any teenager to say no. It’s all about timing, I’m still 20 and not too worried.” \nH is time with Chelsea has been rewarding, though, playing a crucial role in helping the club win the Uefa Youth League in 2015 while Jose Mourinho once said he would be judged a failure if the likes of Brown did not become senior internationals.\nHe credits the difficult loan spell at Vitesse as pivotal in his career, yet it is this season in the Championship when he has really flourished.\nHuddersfield send monthly reports on Brown’s progress and Stuart Webber, the club’s highly rated technical director, has established a decent relationship with Chelsea’s Michael Emenalo. Chelsea know that Huddersfield will look after their players properly and winger Kasey Palmer has also impressed at the John Smith’s Stadium this season.\nChelsea's Michael Emenalo Credit: AFP H uddersfield pay a contribution to his wages, with the incentive of landing a portion of the bonus if the season ends in promotion.\nBrown has settled in well, living in nearby Mirfield, and is already a popular member of the dressing room. On Sunday he went to see Canadian rapper Drake at the Manchester Arena with striker Elias Kachunga and the following day had dinner in Leeds with Michael Hefele – the giant defender who dropped the F-bomb live on Sky Sports after the dramatic win over Leeds this month.\n“It’s a really good dressing room and we all feel we can achieve something special this season,” he says. “Before me and Kasey signed, a lot of the lads were probably thinking we would be flash because we’ve come from Chelsea. But I’m not someone who likes to show off. I’m just really enjoying a different style of football and striving to get better. We’re third in the league and everything is moving in the right direction.\n“Playing Man City in the FA Cup are the games you live for, proving you can play against some of the best players in England.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:11:55.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
