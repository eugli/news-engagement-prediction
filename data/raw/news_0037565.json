February 17, 2017 by Maggie Pehanick 89 Shares \nAfter rebooting classic tales like Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast , it was only a matter of time before Disney decided to make a live-action film out of The Lion King . News of the reboot was announced in 2016, and now there's been an exciting casting update! Disney enlisted director Jon Favreau (who helmed last year's The Jungle Book ), and on Friday, the director revealed that Donald Glover would be playing Simba. I just can't wait to be king. #Simba pic.twitter.com/wUYKixMBJI \n— Jon Favreau (@Jon_Favreau) February 18, 2017 \nAdditionally, legendary James Earl Jones will play Mufasa! Looking forward to working with this legend. #Mufasa pic.twitter.com/1LszbWrcYT \n— Jon Favreau (@Jon_Favreau) February 18, 2017 \nAccording to the press release, \"Disney and Favreau will build on the groundbreaking technology used in The Jungle Book to bring the story of Simba to photorealistic life.\" Interesting . Disney hasn't announced a release date, so right now we can just concentrate on Beauty and the Beast — and all the other Disney movies getting reboots .
