Yiannopoulos had called into Carlson’s program last night, but he appeared in-studio tonight to discuss the aftermath of the rioting and the media’s coverage of it. \nYiannopoulos was scheduled to speak last night at Berkeley, but protests descended into riots and the university called off the event. \nHe recounted for Carlson what happened on campus and said that this is “the price you pay” for daring to be a conservative or libertarian on a college campus. He said liberals call everyone “Nazis” and faulted the mainstream media for creating that environment. \nYiannopoulos called out CNN in particular and said that the press needs to be held to account for the way they legitimize the kind of “appalling” language thrown at anyone even slightly conservative. \nCarlson noted a lot of the press coverage of the rioting last night carried the subtext of “you deserve it” and he took notice of how not very many liberals have come to Yiannopoulos’ defense. \nYiannopoulos said that for them to do that would be to admit that there’s actually a problem on their side. \nHe told Carlson that one of the biggest reasons liberals are outraged by him is that they fear how popular he is and how young his audience is, adding that hate speech now seems to be defined as whatever speech liberals don’t like. \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:44:24.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
