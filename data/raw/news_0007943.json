The Noida lad was honest, charming and showed us the true value of friendship inside the house. His bromance with Manu Punjabi had more genuineness than many fake relationships seen inside the house over the years. He returned home to a hero’s welcome yesterday with a huge crowd greeting him at the airport. However, the celebrations were marred when a video of him dressed as a dulha with his bride was leaked by a regional website, Daily Bhaskar. Manveer was known as a bachelor to all and this was indeed shocking. Here is a look at how things unfolded on the fateful Tuesday afternoon… \nNitibha No No! Manveer Gurjar made news in the later half of his stay with his growing closeness with Nitibha Kaul . The beautiful Delhi girl and the rustic Haryanvi dairy entrepreneur struck up a friendship that was borderline love. Nitibha got ousted but later when she returned she told that Manveer’s fans were calling her bhabhi. Everything was sweet so far. Post his win, India Today asked Manveer’s Bhabhi about what the family felt about his friendship with Nitibha and would it culminate into something more concrete. The lady replied that an outgoing and modern girl like Nitibha was not suitable for the family. The bhabhi said, “She should be homely, simple, and somebody whose thoughts match with Manveer, and who respects the elders in the house. We definitely don’t want someone like Nitibha. There is nothing homely about her.” Okay…Nitibha refused to comment on this. Quite understandable, isn’t it? (Also Read: Bigg Boss 10 winner Manveer Gurjar celebrated his victory with Nitibha Kaul) \nVideo Leak Within hours, a video of Manveer dressed as a dulha was uploaded by regional website Daily Bhaskar. It directly questioned his marital status and his family’s claims that he was a bachelor. They could surely not be looking for prospective brides for an already married man? The clip clearly shows him like a groom with a girl, who seems to be from his locality or hometown. Not only married, the report also said he was father to a five-year-old child.

Even actors and actresses hide their marriages and so can Manveer. We mean he has full rights to chose not to discuss his married. However, co-contestant Gaurav Chopra told us, “As far as I can recollect, he once told Bani J that he was father to a five-year-old girl. Then, he turned around and said he was joking. I do remember this. Of course, it is quite possible that he is a married man.” Now, this was a real twist to the developing case. Rohan Mehra told us that he does not remember Manveer ever mentioning being a married man inside the house.

When he asked his mom about the marriage video, she replied, “Mere bete ki shaadi nahi huyi hai (My son is not yet married). Jo news main aur media mein aa raha hai woh galat hai (The media reports are fake). Aisa koi bhi, kuch bhi bolega aap bharosa karoge ( will you believe any random news). Uski shaadi hogi badi dhoom dhaam se (he will he married with great fanfare).” His other relatives told our correspondent that a huge party will be held in Agahpur after the elections get over in the area. This was the family’s denial. (Also Read: Married or not?

She revealed that he had run away from his own marriage. We were immediately reminded of Sushant Singh Rajput in Shuddh Desi Romance. She said, “No, he never mentioned being married and a father to me. This news is surprising as I was one of his best friends and he never hid stuff from me. But he did say that he ran away from his wedding. This is what he told the makers in his audition tape. He did not reveal the exact reasons but he did run away from the mandap. He did not wish to marry and just escaped from there.” We were dizzy now. (Also Read: Shocking twist!

The hometown hero avoided the press conference and reportedly went straight to a friend’s farmhouse, where he locked himself up. A source told Bollywood Life, “Manveer’s family along with a huge number of people from his hometown were eagerly waiting for him, but he decided to meet his friends first. This hasn’t gone down well with his father, who is quite pissed with Manveer. They are trying to contact him, but he has switched off his phone and has refused to leave his friend’s farmhouse.” (Also Read: Exclusive!

We really hope that Manveer comes out clean as he has worked hard for his win.
