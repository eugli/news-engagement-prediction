(Photo: Darnisha Allen-Jackson) \nWhen Evaughn Person’s 6-5, 330-pound son began to get scholarship offers to some of the most prestigious football programs in the country, her instinct was a bit different from most parents going through the recruiting process for the first time. \nUnsure what she was getting into or what their life was about to become over the next two years, Person figured her first call should be to a lawyer. \n“We were new to this,” she said, reflecting on the process that eventually landed her son, four-star tackle prospect Navaughn Donaldson, with Miami (Fla.). “We didn’t know anything as far as guidelines and NCAA rules. I wanted him to know all his legal options and have a sports attorney let us know the ropes and what you can’t do so that we wouldn’t be messed up in the process.” \nPerson, a real estate agent in south Florida, is part of a growing group of mothers who have expanded their influence in recruiting beyond the role of bystander, becoming at once the spokesperson, the gatekeeper and at times the biggest hurdle a college coach must clear before National Signing Day. \nMORE ON RECRUITING Michigan, Harbaugh make a splash, landing four-star WR Oliver Martin \n“If you didn’t win over my mom, it’s hard for your university to even get a taste,” said DeAngelo Gibbs, a four-star safety from Loganville, Ga., who enrolled early at Georgia. “She held the keys.” \nWhile there’s nothing unusual about parents being a key part of the support structure for recruits, it was only last April, for instance, that the NCAA changed a rule allowing schools to finally pay for parents to accompany their children on official visits. \nThat meant, in many cases, mothers who had financial constraints were sending their children to campuses they had never seen to play for coaches they barely knew. That often left high school coaches or other mentors as the primary conduits between a coaching staff and a prospect. \nBut as recruiting has gotten bigger, with constant phone calls and media requests and camp schedules, mothers are bullying their way to center stage. \nLast year’s top prospect, defensive tackle Rashan Gary, had every aspect of his recruitment and training screened by his mother, Jennifer Coney, who was the main point of contact for coaches and kept extensive notes on their visits before gathering the family to make a final decision to attend Michigan. \nRashan Gary announces his commitment during National Signing Day with his entire family. (Photo: Joe Faraoni, ESPN Images) \nFive-star defensive tackle Aubrey Solomon, who will announce between Michigan, Alabama, Georgia and Southern California on Wednesday, told reporters last fall he would defer to the guidance of his mother, Sabrina Caldwell, on a final decision. She sent schools a comprehensive questionnaire with 31 different topics covering everything from internship opportunities to course selection to statistics on African American male graduates of the school to how the coaching staff communicates with parents. And she made it clear she was looking for more than yes/no answers. \nWhile that’s one of the more extreme examples, Darnisha Allen-Jackson knows firsthand the benefit of being proactive in the recruiting process. Her son, Bryson Allen-Williams, got his first offer from Florida going into his junior year of high school. Having been around the football culture — Allen-Williams’ father, George Williams, played three years in the NFL before a long career in the Arena Football League — Allen-Jackson understood the importance of creating boundaries for her son, who is now a starting linebacker at South Carolina. \nShe took away his Facebook (though she let him keep Twitter), set strict hours for college coaches to made Sundays off-limits from recruiting, although one school defied her by putting two attractive young women on FaceTime inviting Allen-Williams to party with them the following weekend. (“They were immediately out,” she said.) Looking for a QB? Try the Dallas Metroplex \nAllen-Jackson also picked up very quickly that college coaches are salesmen and were only going to show the best they had to offer, putting the onus on herself to find out the real story. \n“Brian VanGorder (then the defensive coordinator at Auburn) told me the first time I met him, ‘It’s my job to make mom thinks she’s beautiful, to make dad think he knows everything about football, kiss the babies, shake grandpa and grandma’s hand, but once I get your son on campus, all bets are off,’” Allen-Jackson said. “I took it with me on every visit. You have to make sure you don’t get starstruck. Everywhere you go has a beautiful campus, everywhere has fabulous facilities, everything is wonderful but you can’t be swayed by that. \n“You have to understand how it is when the fluff goes away. We’d go up unannounced and say, ‘Hey coach, I’m in town, can we come by?’ to see what the culture was like. You have to build relationships with those coaches because these are men who are going who are responsible for your son and they’re going to finish raising him.” \nDealing with recruiting-savvy mothers can sometimes be intimidating or unnatural for coaches, moreso than talking football with fathers or high school coaches. \nAshley Smith, the executive assistant to Tennessee head coach Butch Jones, had the dual role during this recruiting cycle of sister to five-star offensive tackle Trey Smith and also a key cog in Tennessee’s recruiting operation, working with student hosts and educating families on what the school has to offer. \nTennessee coach Butch Jones seeks guidance in the recruitment process on relating to the female family members who play a pivotal role in the decision. (Photo: Randy Sartin, USA TODAY Sports) \nShe said Tennessee’s coaches constantly ask her for guidance in relating to the female family members guiding a recruitment, as she did with Trey, who signed with the Vols as an early enrollee. \n“I think the biggest thing is that coaches get solely focused on dealing with the student-athlete, and at the end of the day the student-athlete will make the decision but he’ll consult his mom, his dad, whoever’s in the picture and that’s the biggest thing I found myself constantly reminding coaches is you have to develop that relationship with the family members that will be part of the decision-making process,” said Smith, who previously worked at the NCAA in the championships department. “I think it’s helped a lot that I’ve been through this process that I can relate and connect with moms and sisters as they’re going through this and can relate to both sides whether you’re the side that’s being recruited or trying to help recruit. It’s a blessing and a unique trait that I bring to the UT staff.\" \nPerson said some coaching staffs who recruited her son resisted the idea that the mother was taking the lead role, which was an automatic disqualification. Among her key concerns was how family members of players were treated on the visits, knowing the point of contact in an emergency or injury, dorm safety, whether the school was going to have a good enough meal plan to feed her offensive tackle and, interestingly enough, building a relationship with the position coach’s wife. \n“They would be the mother while you’re gone if they’re participating in that program like they’re supposed to,” Person said. “Some coaches didn’t understand when it comes to a mother and child, we have a bond and that bond isn’t easily broken. When everything is said and done, guess who's going to be around? Mommy. Once they’re finished with him he’s going to always come back home if you have a good relationships with your child. That’s what they’re going to do, and some weren’t receptive to the fact I was (involved). The wives understood, but some of the coaches didn’t.” \nGibbs, whose mother is a middle school assistant principal outside of Atlanta and has an educational background in criminal justice, said the decision to attend Georgia was ultimately his. But he relied on his mother more than anything to help cut through the noise. \n“Every time we went to a school, a university, she was the first person int eh coach’s face asking questions, talking, seeing how they were reaction to what she had to say,” he said. “Could they answer certain questions? She’s tough. She knows how to break down information, get answers. They had to pass her test first.” \nEARLY TOP 25 FOR 2017 SEASON Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 1. Florida State: The Seminoles stumbled out of the gate this past season before hitting another gear following a loss to Clemson in October. With valuable experience under their belt and as much talent as any team in the country, Florida State is the team to beat in the Atlantic Coast Conference and very deserving of the title of preseason No. 1 in August. Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 2. Alabama: Personnel hits are coming, but that’s never derailed Alabama in the past. Quarterback Jalen Hurts will be even better, the offense should be more focused on the running game with a new coordinator and the defense will again rank among the nation’s best. Take note: Alabama and FSU meet in the opener. Brett Davis, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 3. Ohio State: Like the Crimson Tide, the Buckeyes will need to reload after losing several underclassmen to the NFL draft. But there will be far fewer losses this offseason than a year ago, so look for Ohio State to be loaded with talent and experience, not to mention more streamlined and less predictable on offense after some staffing changes. Rich Barnes, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 4. Michigan: The Wolverines will be right on the Buckeyes’ heels, as they were in 2016 — and as will be the case for as long as Jim Harbaugh and Urban Meyer are in charge. There is too much to like about Michigan to list here, but begin with the major assets: a wonderful defense despite a few losses in the back seven, a physical and punishing brand of offense, and a sense of unfinished business after two painful losses to end this year. Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 5. Washington: Reaching the Peach Bowl showed Washington’s growth, though the loss to Alabama revealed the distance still to travel before the Huskies can win a national championship. Considering Chris Petersen’s history, the 2017 team could be better than this year’s version, even if there will be a number of personnel issues to address as a result of early departures. The Huskies will be the preseason favorites in the Pac-12 and a strong contender for the Playoff. Jennifer Buchanan, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 6. Oklahoma: The Sooners obviously must improve on defense after a sluggish season, but there’s reason for optimism. Given the likely production of the Baker Mayfield-led offense, OU is simply a defense away from taking the Big 12 and returning to the Playoff. The Sooners have enormous expectations but slightly more question marks than the five teams listed above. Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 7. USC: Let the hype begin for USC and its superb quarterback Sam Darnold, who will begin his sophomore season at or near the top of every Heisman Trophy list. The question: Are the Trojans ready to take the next step? The ability and athleticism are there, but the potential departure of several NFL-ready underclassmen bears watching. Gary A. Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 8. Penn State: The Nittany Lions’ biggest post-regular season development was offensive coordinator Joe Moorhead’s decision to return in 2017. That, along with the return of quarterback Trace McSorley and running back Saquon Barkley, will ensure this offseason will be even better next season. Recapturing this year’s magic won’t be easy, but there’s zero reason to think Penn State is poised to take any step back. Marc Lebryk, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 9. Clemson: Clemson is among the most intriguing teams in college football entering next season. Deshaun Watson won’t be around, and that alone is reason to think the Tigers will begin the year pegged to finish behind Florida State. But this program recruits an elite level, has an outstanding defensive line, should get improved play on the offensive line and has earned the benefit of the doubt. Still, there will be major weapons to replace on offense and key leaders to replace on defense. This may nonetheless be too low a ranking for Clemson. Joshua S. Kelly, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 10. Oklahoma State: To call Oklahoma State a sleeper ignores the fact that this program has been in the national picture for the better part of the decade. But there seems to be something overlooked about the Cowboys, who return the heart of their offense and have enough coming back on defense to be right alongside or just behind Oklahoma on the Big 12 ladder. Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports 11. LSU: The Tigers’ impressive bowl win against Louisville provided some early validation for Ed Orgeron. How far LSU goes hinges almost entirely on how quickly new coordinator Matt Canada can turn around the offense. Jonathan Dyer, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 12. Wisconsin: Any doubts of Wisconsin’s ability to remain a national presence should be dismissed after another banner year for Paul Chryst and the Badgers. UW will be just behind the top three of Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State in the Big Ten. Thomas J. Russo, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 13. Virginia Tech: In what was supposed to be a building year, Justin Fuente led the Hokies to a divisional title and 10 wins. The future will be even better, beginning with a 2017 team that should repeat atop the ACC Coastal Division. Jim Dedmon, Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 14. Auburn: This is the most intriguing team in the SEC and perhaps in all of college football. Auburn is often hit or miss, but the addition of Baylor transfer Jarrett Stidham should kick the Tigers’ offense into a different gear. But will that be enough? Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 15. Stanford: Replacing Christian McCaffrey and finding better quarterback play are the Cardinal’s most pressing questions entering the offseason. This might not be a perfect team, but trust in David Shaw and his staff to pilot Stanford to another season spent in the thick of the Pac-12 and Rose Bowl hunt. Ivan Pierre Aguirre, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 16. Boise State: The top-ranked team from the Group of Five ranks will again be a favorite for double-digit wins during the regular season. Look for quarterback Brett Rypien to take another step forward and become a top-10 player at his position nationally. Matt Kartozian, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 17. Georgia: The SEC East Division will be a toss-up, with Georgia and two other teams soon to appear on this battling for a shot at the conference title. The Bulldogs seem the most likely to take another step forward thanks to quarterback Jacob Eason’s development and the arrival of an outstanding recruiting class. Justin Ford, USA TODAY Sports 18. Tennessee: But the Volunteers aren’t far behind. Much depends on finding a capable successor to quarterback Josh Dobbs and locating the sort of consistency needed to go from top-25 team to Playoff contender. Christopher Hanewinckel, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 19. Louisville: There’s always reining Heisman winner Lamar Jackson, but Louisville’s late swoon raises the issue of whether this team is about more than just a sublime quarterback and offense. While still very much a threat in the ACC, the Cardinals should be placed behind FSU and Clemson in the Atlantic Division. Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 20. South Florida: Adding a defense-first coach in Charlie Strong to an impressive offense will keep USF in the mix for 10-plus wins and a New Year’s Six bowl in 2017. There are several strong contenders in the American Athletic Conference, but the Bulls are the preseason favorite. Shanna Lockwood, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 21. Utah: Pegging the Utes for a national ranking seems like a safe bet. Whether Utah can do more – such as knock off USC and win the South Division – remains a question, however, particularly with losses at running back, wide receiver and the defensive line. Kelley L Cox, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 22. Florida: It all comes down to the offense, and whether the Gators’ attack can finally find some momentum under Jim McElwain and produce at the rate needed to compete for a Playoff berth. That’s still a concern entering McElwain’s third season in charge. Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 23. West Virginia: There will be a new quarterback and a different look on defense, especially in the secondary. The Mountaineers are still a threat for a top-three finish in the Big 12 after what may very well be a breakthrough season for Dana Holgorsen. Logan Bowles, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 24. Texas: Does Texas have the same potential as Tom Herman’s first team at Houston, which went 13-1 and won the Peach Bowl? Maybe, but probably not. This team won’t win the Big 12, but a change in culture and a huge uptick in production on offense should find the Longhorns at eight or nine wins in 2017. Brendan Maloney, USA TODAY Sports 25. UCLA: It almost never pays to have faith in Jim Mora and UCLA, but years of strong recruiting and a healthy Josh Rosen under center should yield a nice rebound after a horrific 2016 season. Mark J.
