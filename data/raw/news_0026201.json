[PHOTO: CAROLINE CHEBET/STANDARD] \nA third-year student at Egerton University jumped out of a speeding vehicle under unclear circumstances. \nAbigael Wachira Muthoni, 20, is in a coma after she suffered brain damage, a condition that has affected her speech, sight and hearing. \nMs Muthoni, a bachelor of education degree student at the institution's town campus in Nakuru, is said to have been in the company of a friend who studies at a local college. The two were later joined by a Francis Njoroge. \nNarrating the ordeal to The Standard, Muthoni's friend, who also jumped out of the vehicle, said the incident happened on January 27. \nThe student said she met Muthoni in town where they shopped before leaving together for Section 58 where Muthoni lived. They were joined by Mr Njoroge. \nShe said they all had dinner at Grill Park Hotel and Njoroge agreed to drive them home at around 11.30pm. \nALSO READ: Kenya's disabled mothers neglected due to dearth of data \nHowever, instead of heading to Section 58, Njoroge drove in the opposite direction heading to Njoro, she claimed. The student said she decided to jump out of the vehicle at the Rift Valley Institute of Science and Technology. It was a little after 11.30pm. \n\"(He) agreed to take us to Muthoni's house but he instead threatened us. We decided to jump out of the vehicle,\" said the student, unable to hold back her tears. \nFriends took her to Baraka Hospital in Nakuru town. At around 9.30am while heading back home, she received information that Muthoni had been admitted to Valley Hospital. \nNakuru OCPD Joshua Omukata said police and Criminal Investigations Directorate officers are looking for Njoroge, who went into hiding immediately after the incident. \n\"I personally feel so sad for the student to have sustained brain damage,\" said Omukata.
