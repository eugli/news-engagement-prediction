'You're my warrior': Lex Wotton and the fight for justice after the Palm Island riots Read more \nGuardian Australia this month revealed the appeal was lodged despite widespread opposition among state government ministers, with one saying: “This is not what we stand for.” \nFederal MP Cathy O’Toole, whose seat of Herbert includes Palm Island, criticised the move to appeal as “unfair and unjust”. \nA petition begun by Smallwood calling for the appeal to be dropped drew almost 18,000 signatures . Smallwood said she and Palm Island man Lex Wotton, who spearheaded the class action in which his family was awarded a total of $220,000 in damages, were now both “thrilled and overwhelmed”. \nSmallwood said it was a “victory for people power” in what was “a very serious matter about social justice”. \nThe decision paves the way for further damages claims by Palm Island residents. \nLawyer Stewart Levitt, who acted in the class action, said the federal court ruling would stand as a precedent that “gives us the opportunity to continue the fight in other places”. \n“We now can hold other police forces to account, to a similar standard, where there are similar infractions being committed today to those that were criticised in 2004 in respect of Queensland police,” he said. \nLevitt said Palm Island’s Indigenous residents had “channelled their hopes and aspirations through the orthodox legal system, and for the first time in living memory reached a positive outcome from a superior court on a matter of extreme national importance”. \n“To see a state government take action to try to overturn that in circumstances where not a single Indigenous person was consulted about that decision, I thought was very unhealthy. \n“It effectively made it a black versus white issue rather than a human rights issue.” \nThe federal court is still to decide issues about any apology from police, legal costs and the entitlement of other residents to compensation. \n“The scope of the claims is wide. There are some people who may have suffered trivial damage and others who have been traumatised for life,” Levitt said.
