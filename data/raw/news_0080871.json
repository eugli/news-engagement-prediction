It is believed that the man had used a type of machete to cut open his stomach as he could no longer tolerate the severe abdominal pains he had been experiencing recently. According to police, the man's condition had stabilised but he remained unconscious in the intensive care unit of Hospital Kuala Krai. His neighbour, Mohd Azhar Azmi, 41, said the man was earlier diagnosed with gastritis and had sought alternative treatment but his condition did not improve. It was reported that the man had locked himself in the room before the wife and son forcefully kicked open the door. The wife and son were stunned to see him pulling out the intestines, said Mohd Azhar who alerted the police.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:28:43.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
