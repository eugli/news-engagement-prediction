Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDonald Trump’s Defence Department may recommend sending combat troops into Syria to fight Islamic State militants, US reports have claimed. \nAlready a small number of specials forces operate in the war-torn country, but the previous Obama administration had rejected putting soldiers on the ground. \nAccording to CNN although the Pentagon has not yet proposed the deployment to the White House it was under consideration. \"It's possible that you may see conventional forces hit the ground in Syria for some period of time,\" one defence official. \nUltimately the decision will lie with President Trump who has made no secret of his plans to tackle ISIS. \nDiscussing the terror group on the campaign trail, he pledged to \"bomb the s--t out of them.\" \nIn September, Trump said: \"I am also going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction: They will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for defeating ISIS.\" \nUS military planners and intelligence officials are reported to have mapped virtually every airstrip and location in Syria that might have to be used by US troops. \nOne option would put hundreds, if not thousands, of additional troops into a combat role as part of the fight to take Raqqa.

With Mosul in north Iraq about to fall, IS is desperately trying to keep its grip on Raqqa in Syria. \nBut Syrian Democratic Forces and American special forces are preparing to seize it.

Then there will be a decision point to move in.” \nThere are more than 6,000 US troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria, backed by hundreds of British Special Forces and regular soldiers training local army recruits in Iraq. \nThe Pentagon is believed to be preparing to announce an increase in the numbers of troops being deployed to Iraq.
