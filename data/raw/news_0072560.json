Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nSen. Marco Rubio explained this morning why he decided not to accept an invitation to a town hall event and why he feels they are becoming a waste of time. Rubio knocks town halls: They're designed to \"heckle and scream at me in front of cameras\" https://t.co/UaBrxHzLbP pic.twitter.com/4itCIR7gv5 \n— The Hill (@thehill) February 26, 2017 \n“The problem now is, and it’s all in writing, I’m not making this up. What these groups really want is for me to schedule a public forum, they then organize three, four, five, six hundred liberal activists in the two counties or wherever I am in the state.” \n“They spread themselves out. They ask questions. They all cheer when the questions are asked,” he said. \n“They are instructed to boo no matter what answer I give. They are instructed to interrupt me if I go too long and start chanting things. Then, at the end, they are also told not to give up their microphone when they ask questions. It’s all in writing in this indivisible document,” he said, referencing the online group Indivisible that labels itself as a “practical guide for resisting the Trump agenda.” \nHoward Dean took a shot at Rubio and compared the town hall hecklers to the Tea Party. Just like the tea party which got you into office, Senator. https://t.co/EJQRkRFZny \n— Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) February 26, 2017 Trending HA! Women's March asks men how they'll support 'Day Without A Woman', men answer HILARIOUSLY \nWith all due respect, the two really can’t be compared. The Tea Party was created as a structured movement to promote smaller government and boost candidates who espouse conservative ideals. The town hall protesters probably couldn’t agree on a single issue, except … RESIST TRUMP! Oh, and it’s also highly doubtful that town hall hecklers will be targeted by the IRS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:52:44.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
