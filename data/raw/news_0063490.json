Police said she showed her breasts and buttocks while she danced in front of and on the man in December after informing him, “I’m a girl. You know what that means.” \nInvestigators said the man has dementia, but Fultz’s attorney said the resident could have told her to stop but didn’t. \n“The man knew exactly what was going on and had no problem whatsoever with it,” defence attorney Geoffrey Oglesby said Wednesday. \nPolice said the caretaker who recorded Fultz later showed the video to a supervisor, who reported it to police this month. \nThe second caretaker wasn’t charged. \nThe director of the assisted living centre said Fultz, of Marblehead, was fired and the other caretaker also no longer works at the facility. \nThe most recent annual state inspection report of the centre shows no citations, according to Ohio Department of Aging records.
