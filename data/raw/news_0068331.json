Eric Greitens for a community clean-up event at the cemetery. \n“It’s been inspiring to people all across this country to see the way the people of Missouri have rallied around the Jewish community with compassion and support,” the vice president said. “You have inspired this nation with your kindness and your care.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:47:47.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
