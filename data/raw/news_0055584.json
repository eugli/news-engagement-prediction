'Safety net' \nCompany director Colin Hayburn described the Irish facility, in Dundalk, as \"a safety net\". \nHe said it would have \"minimal\" operational requirements in the short term, but could be ramped up when needed. \nMr Hayburn added that if EU-UK regulatory equivalence was achieved as part of Brexit, Almac \"should be fine\". \nBut if that equivalence is not achieved it would be a \"difficult situation\", he added.
