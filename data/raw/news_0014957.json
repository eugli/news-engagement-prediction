PHOTO: AFP \nDUBAI: Azhar Ali said on Friday he was desperate to resurrect his fortunes with the bat ahead of the 2019 World Cup after giving up the Pakistan ODI captaincy to be replaced by Sarfraz Ahmed. \nThe 31-year-old was already facing calls for his head following Pakistan’s dismal 4-1 series loss in Australia last month, but on Thursday he offered his resignation from the high-pressure job to Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan. \n“I want to focus more on batting,” said Azhar. “That’s why I also left the Test vice-captaincy as this is the right time to further improve my batting.” \nNew ODI captain Sarfraz likely to lead in all three formats \nAzhar managed just 37 runs in the three ODIs he played in Australia while he missed two matches through injury. \n“I am honoured to have led Pakistan. I tried my best but results did not come,” said Azhar, who was surprisingly appointed after Misbahul Haq quit ODIs following Pakistan’s quarter-final exit at the 2015 World Cup. \nHe was not even part of the one-day team for 15 months before being made captain. His tenure was also marred by being blanked 3-0 for the first time by neighbours Bangladesh. \nMoin blasts Azhar, says he doesn’t deserve to be captain \nOverall, he skippered Pakistan in 31 matches, losing 18 and winning 12 with one no result. That period also saw Pakistan drop as low as ninth in the one-day rankings. \nTheir current ranking is eighth and they face the threat of losing out on direct qualification for the 2019 Wold Cup in England. The top seven teams, plus hosts England, on the cut-off date of September 30 this year will get direct entry to the World Cup. The four remaining teams will play a qualifying round in 2018. \nAzhar Ali aims low as Pakistan risk missing out on 2019 World Cup \nAzhar said it was time to move on in his career. \n“It was like swimming against the tide which was not correct. I think this is not the right team to seek the captaincy or vice-captaincy,” he said. \nPakistan’s next assignment is a three-match ODI series in the West Indies followed by two T20Is and three Tests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T08:41:18.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
