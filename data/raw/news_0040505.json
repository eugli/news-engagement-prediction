That energy is now being channeled into another day of demonstration, albeit of a different sort ― there's a planned women's strike in the works for next month. And, according to a intersectional collection of activists and academics wrote in a recent op-ed, it's being organized in order to protest \"against male violence and in defense of reproductive rights.\" \nLast week, an op-ed for The Guardian by a host of prominent voices ― Linda Martín Alcoff, Cinzia Arruzza, Tithi Bhattacharya, Nancy Fraser, Barbara Ransby, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, Rasmea Yousef Odeh, and Angela Davis to be specific ― made that point very clear. They called for public opposition not just to Trump, but also to \"anti-labor\" neoliberal policies and corporate globalization, things commonly criticized by the progressive left. \nIn fact, if you're looking to get a sense of what the strike will be all about and whether you'd be interested in participating, checking out that call to action is a good way to start. In that spirit, here are seven of the most spot-on quotes from the op-ed. 1. \"It Is Not Enough To Oppose Trump\" Source: Pool/Getty Images News/Getty Images In our view, it is not enough to oppose Trump and his aggressively misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic and racist policies. We also need to target the ongoing neoliberal attack on social provision and labor rights. 2. \"Women's Conditions Of Life\" Source: Spencer Platt/Getty Images News/Getty Images Women’s conditions of life, especially those of women of color and of working, unemployed and migrant women, have steadily deteriorated over the last 30 years, thanks to financialization and corporate globalization. 3. Feminism For The 99 Percent Source: Mario Tama/Getty Images News/Getty Images Lean-in feminism and other variants of corporate feminism have failed the overwhelming majority of us, who do not have access to individual self-promotion and advancement and whose conditions of life can be improved only through policies that defend social reproduction, secure reproductive justice and guarantee labor rights. As we see it, the new wave of women’s mobilization must address all these concerns in a frontal way. It must be a feminism for the 99%. 4. \"The Idea Is To Mobilize Women\" Source: Mario Tama/Getty Images News/Getty Images The idea is to mobilize women, including trans women, and all who support them in an international day of struggle – a day of striking, marching, blocking roads, bridges, and squares, abstaining from domestic, care and sex work, boycotting, calling out misogynistic politicians and companies, striking in educational institutions. 5. Defining \"Violence Against Women\" Source: Mike Coppola/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images Violence against women, as [ Argentinian protest movement Ni Una Menos ] define it, has many facets: it is domestic violence, but also the violence of the market, of debt, of capitalist property relations, and of the state; the violence of discriminatory policies against lesbian, trans and queer women; the violence of state criminalization of migratory movements; the violence of mass incarceration; and the institutional violence against women’s bodies through abortion bans and lack of access to free healthcare and free abortion. 6. \"It Is Important Not To Lose Momentum\" Activists plan 'A Day Without a Woman' strike to follow historic Women's March https://t.co/95pjzqPYqo pic.twitter.com/hymwJOougn ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:46:49.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
