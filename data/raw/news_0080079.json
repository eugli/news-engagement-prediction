One of the events being advertised on the mirror of the men’s restroom is entitled “Words Your Body Needs to Hear,” and will be taking place in the Swartz Hall lobby on Tuesday.\n Social Justice , Tech , Bucknell , Bucknell college", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/tciccotta/status/836098983135166468", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Ftech%2F2017%2F02%2F27%2Fbucknell-students-cover-residence-hall-mirrors%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Bucknell+Covers+Residence+Hall+Mirrors+to+Promote+%E2%80%98Body+Positivity%2C%E2%80%99+and+%E2%80%98Self-Love%E2%80%99", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Ftech%2F2017%2F02%2F27%2Fbucknell-students-cover-residence-hall-mirrors%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Bucknell+Covers+Residence+Hall+Mirrors+to+Promote+%E2%80%98Body+Positivity%2C%E2%80%99+and+%E2%80%98Self-Love%E2%80%99&shortener=bitly", "https://twitter.com/BucknellU", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Ftech%2F2017%2F02%2F27%2Fbucknell-students-cover-residence-hall-mirrors%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Bucknell+Covers+Residence+Hall+Mirrors+to+Promote+%E2%80%98Body+Positivity%2C%E2%80%99+and+%E2%80%98Self-Love%E2%80%99"], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:35:42.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
