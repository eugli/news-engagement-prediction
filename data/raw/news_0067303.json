No reason was given. Those who were about to book tickets were advised not to go ahead. Even the tickets booked by both families have been cancelled,\" a source told the newspaper. One of the invitees was quoted as saying, \"All was well until last week.\"\nShriya Bhupal and her family attended Akhil's elder brother Naga Chaitanya's engagement ceremony in January this year.
