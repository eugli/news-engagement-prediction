It’s highly unlikely that they will allow Ozil and Sanchez to enter their final 12 months of their deal so they either sign a new contract or Arsenal will have to look to sell them. Article continues below \nAnd trusted journalist, John Cross, has just provided an update on the futures of the duo - most notably where Sanchez is concerned. \nThe chief Mirror football writer believes that the Chilean has “made up his mind” in leaving Arsenal with some major European clubs interested in signing him. Article continues below \n\"Sanchez will go,\" said John Cross. \"His mind's made up. \n“I think there's big clubs in for him - PSG, Juventus as well.\" \nSanchez has been in fine form this campaign, spearheading Arsenal’s attack scoring 20 goals in the process. \nHowever, you’d have to be extremely naive to think that the forward is totally happy at Arsenal at the moment. The former Barcelona star has had numerous tantrums this season, including sitting with a coat over his head after being substituted against Swansea. Ozil's future \nBut fear not Arsenal fans, Cross has much more positive news when it comes to Ozil. \nThere doesn’t appear to be quite as much concern over the German’s future and the Mirror’s football writer believes there is a much better chance of him staying, despite Sanchez wanting out. \n\"But I do think Ozil is much more likely to stay and sign a new deal than Sanchez,” Cross added. \nIt seems Arsenal’s best case scenario this season is a second-placed finish and an FA Cup win. Will that be enough to convince Sanchez and Ozil to sign new deals at the club? \nWe’ll find out in the summer. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
