The Vice President was also asked to secure from the communities a buy-in of peace and collaboration from state governments and the oil companies in particular. \n“To show his determination and commitment to create a new understanding and atmosphere between the government and the communities, the President in fact, gave an order after the Vice President’s visit to Gbaramatu that an investigation be conducted to determine what happened during an alleged military raid of Gbaramatu community where the kingdom’s Golden Sword was allegedly taken away. \n“The presidential order also directed that a search for the golden sword of the kingdom, allegedly confisticated, if this is found to be so, should be recovered and once located, promptly released to the kingdom with an apology.” \nIt will be recalled that Chief Government Ekpemupolo had threatened to take steps to recover the missing golden sword, which is also referred to as the traditional symbol of authority of Gbaramatu Kingdom. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:40:26.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
