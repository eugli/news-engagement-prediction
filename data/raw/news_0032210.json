Trading standards officials said many shoppers might not have noticed that the discounts were not given at the till \nT he BBC visited 50 stores across the country and found 33 of them were still advertising expired offers, which were not applied at the checkout. \nEven after reporters pointed out the discrepancies to staff, some stores still failed to remove out-of-date labels on the shelves. In the worst case, staff at a TescoExpress outlet in Birmingham repeatedly failed to remove labels showing produce as on offer when it no longer was for more than month after it was brought to their attention. \n“That is very bad. It’s pretty basic that if one customer has shown something wrong then it’s put right to stop other customers being misled” added Mr Fisher \nResponding to the findings a Tesco Spokesperson said “We take great care to deliver clear and accurate labels for our customers so they can make informed decisions on the products they buy. \n“We are disappointed that errors occurred and will be working with the stores involved to reinforce our responsibilities to our customers”. Supermarkets have previously come under fire from watchdogs for multibuy deals which do not actually save money \nT esco says it will be double checking the accuracy of the price labels at all its stores as a result of the BBC’s investigation. \nThe company runs more than 3,500 stores across the UK. \nLast year Tesco was criticised by farming unions for selling meat and fresh produce under made-up British farm names such as ‘Woodside Farms.’ \nThe union has lodged a formal complaint with trading standards, claiming that British-sounding farm names mislead consumers into thinking they are buying British produce, when it may be from abroad. \nMeat sold under the \"Boswell Farms\" and \"Woodside Farms\" brands was found to come from the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland. \nThe new investigation can be seen on BBC1 at 7.30pm on Monday February 13th and on iplayer for 30 days after.
