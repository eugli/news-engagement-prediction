The fact that Aikman commands such attention for this type of announcement shows the strength of his magnetic pull. \nThat's what he and United Way are betting on. \n\"Troy's leadership and visibility is a way to illuminate our work with new audiences that we may not reach with a workplace campaign,\" says Jennifer Sampson, president and CEO of United Way of Metropolitan Dallas. \"He's a big name with a big presence: super-star football player, and he's been a broadcaster now longer than he played football for the Cowboys. He's got a global following.\" \nRandall Stephenson, president and CEO of AT&T and the campaign chair of the 2011-12 drive, agrees. \"My name recognition in this community is 10 percent on a good day,\" he says. \"Troy Aikman is like 80 percent name recognition. What a great way to showcase United Way.\" \nAikman is jump-starting the campaign Saturday night with a star-studded reunion of Dallas Cowboys' 1990s championship teams of Super Bowls XXVII, XXVIII and XXX. \nIt was patterned after United Way's 90th anniversary celebration that Aikman co-chaired with Dallas Cowboys Executive Vice President Charlotte Jones Anderson. \n\"The question I posed to Jennifer was: 'Around a football reunion, can we somehow have an event that will have a significant impact on the community?' You won't find it surprising that her answer was yes. So an intimate setting morphed into this big event now with Dwight Yoakam and all these people coming in. It's going to be awesome. It's beyond my expectations. We're going to have a great time.\" \nThe evening will feature appearances by Cowboys legends, a conversation with former head coach Jimmy Johnson and other members of the 1992 coaching staff and a salute to Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for recently making it into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. \nProceeds from the private event for about 600 at Gilley's will benefit United Way. \nAikman's ties with United Way date back to his early playing days, when he did promotional spots as part the nonprofit's partnership with the NFL. Troy Aikman's desire to help Dallas win continues with $1M United Way gift \nHis involvement has grown steadily since 2011, when he and Ken Cooper launched the Healthy Zone Schools Recognition Program, a partnership between United Way and the Cooper Institute to fight childhood obesity. \nLast April, Aikman gave a million bucks to the nonprofit's Unite Forever Campaign. That fund allows the donor to call the shots about how the money is invested and where it's distributed. \nAnd we all know how Aikman feels about being the guy in charge. CEOs have Aikman's back \nAikman's campaign chairmanship is a departure from United Way's playbook of tapping a global corporate chieftain as the man in charge. \nSix years ago, Stephenson became the first in a power chain of CEOs to take over North Texas' most visible and largest employee-giving fundraiser. \nStephenson was followed by Rich Templeton at Texas Instruments, Tom Falk at Kimberly-Clark, Tom Greco, then CEO of Frito-Lay North America, and David Seaton at Fluor. They each set records and helped re-establish United Way's waning cachet in the business community. \nThis year's chair, Mark Rohr, CEO of Celanese, is closing in on a record goal of $75 million. If successful, that total will surpass the recessionary trough of 2009 by nearly 50 percent. \nIn each instance, the CEO came with a team of senior management backed by the goodwill and deep pockets of the entire corporation. \nBut Aikman isn't a CEO and doesn't have a company.

(Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer \nSo the past chairmen sent Aikman individual letters pledging to back him so that he can add to their happy string of one-upmanship. \n\"We've got a bit of a flywheel going here,\" Stephenson says. \"We told Troy, 'Look, if you can step up, put in your time and effort, lend your prestige, your name and your contacts, we will bring the machine to run this thing for you. You don't have to have a machine. Use ours.' That's essentially what's happened.\" \nDid Stephenson's letter include an offer of free phone service for life? \n\"No, I didn't want to set that marker for the next person,\" he quips. \"I just asked him to step up and serve the community and said I'd put the full weight and resources of AT&T behind him if he would.\" \nAikman says it was hard to say no to such an impressive line. \n\"That's the reason they run the companies that they run and the influence that they have,\" he says. \"They're very persuasive. They felt I would be perfect at this point in time to advance the ball for United Way.\" Not revealing his game plan \nAikman laughs when asked just how far upfield he wants to go. \n\"There's no question that we'll be successful,\" he says. \"But to what extent or level, I'm not at liberty to say.\" â€” Troy Aikman (@TroyAikman) February 23, 2017 \nSampson says they'll get down to brass tacks this summer. \n\"Troy's going to make it even bigger, better. That's what quarterbacks do,\" Sampson says. \"The sky's the limit with someone like Troy in this role.\" \nTwo things still give Aikman pause -- beginning with time away from his daughters, who are in the eighth and ninth grades. \n\"I've got four or five years with them, and I'm trying to maximize that as much as I can. I'm gone every weekend during the season.\" \nAnd then there's his competitive spirit. He wants to post another record. \n\"I believe we will. If not, then instead of giving me free phone service, Randall Stephenson may be writing some really big checks,\" he says with his signature Troy smile. \"But I'm confident he won't have to do that.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:37:33.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
