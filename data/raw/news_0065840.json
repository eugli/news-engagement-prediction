He said he has a gun and he is going to the school. \n\"I think it was brought to the attention of the teachers by another pupil who saw it. \n\"They reported it to someone and they followed protocol. They called the police and they are now on the school premises.\" Read More Avon and Somerset Police investigating the post (Photo: PA) \nThe source added:\"They are on amber alert. Red alert is where they go into full lockdown. \n\"They are not going into full lockdown yet because the haven't substantiated it yet. \n\"The police have also searched where he lives but he's not there. \n\"Parents have started turning up at the school to take their kids home, so they are obviously worried enough to do that. \n\"It is a hectic situation at the school at the moment.\" \nInspector Paul Bolton-Jones, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: \"We are aware of a rumour circulating around the school regarding a threat to pupils. \n\"We are not treating it as credible. \n\"Neighbourhood officers are at the school solely to reassure pupils and parents.\" \nThe school could not immediately be reached for a comment this afternoon.
