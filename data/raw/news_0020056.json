This means only Jacob Zuma can authorise the employment of the SANDF.

In this case‚ the president has deployed soldiers to assist the police‚ which he did in 2015 during a spate of xenophobic attacks. \nWhen the president decides to deploy the army‚ the first thing he has to do is inform Parliament. He has to give details to Parliament as to why the army is being deployed‚ in which areas‚ how many soldiers will be sent out‚ and for how long. \nIf Parliament is not sitting at that time‚ he has seven days to inform MPs. \nIf Parliament does not agree with the deployment‚ it can call the president to account for his actions. It probably won’t happen in this case. \nIf Parliament feels the president went too far‚ the National Assembly has the power to remove the president. This can only happen after it gets detailed information about the deployment. \nThe law allows for “security services” - which includes the defence force - to enter the parliamentary precincts and perform “any policing function in the precincts” in two situations: with the permission of the speaker and secondly‚ when there is an immediate danger to life or safety‚ or a threat of damage to property. \n– TMG Digital/BusinessLIVE Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
