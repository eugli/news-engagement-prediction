He was also charged with criminally intimidating one of the dentists. \nQ&M Dental has also lodged a complaint with the Malaysia Dental Council against Dr Hong for unprofessional conduct as a dentist for previously carrying out unapproved procedures in its clinics. \nThe company said that contributions from Johor do not materially affect its performance and financial results. \nChong, a mother of two, made headlines in Malaysia after winning the Mrs Malaysia Universe pageantry in 2015. – The Straits Times/Asia News Network \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:57:08.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
