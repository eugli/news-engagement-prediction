Conway did not directly answer, but said Flynn’s role had become “unsustainable” since he misled the administration about his call with America’s Russian ambassador. — TODAY (@TODAYshow) February 14, 2017 \nAs Lauer pointed out, that logic does not hold up. The Justice Department warned the White House last month that Flynn mischaracterized his December call — in which he discussed lifting sanctions placed by former President Obama — and left himself vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians. \nConway, appearing exhausted on air, called that warning “one characterization” of the call. She said Flynn continued attending daily briefings and calls up through the day he resigned. \n“As time wore on, obviously the situation became unsustainable,” she said. Michael Flynn resigned Monday night. (YURI GRIPAS/REUTERS) \nRussian lawmakers defend Michael Flynn, blame U.S. for his exit \nHe pointed out that Flynn, a retired general with three decades of military experience, should have known that a call with a Russian ambassador would likely have been wiretapped by American intelligence officials and subject to severe scrutiny. \n“The key here, and I want to repeat it, is the misleading of the vice president and others,” Conway said.
