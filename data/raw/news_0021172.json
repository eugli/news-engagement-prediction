I'm the kind of individual who spends her time memorizing Beyoncé's entire concert routine and plots opportunities to actually meet her in person one day. For the record, I once met her backup dancers in Vegas and instantly started to cry. \nOf course, I was immediately Bey-sessed upon watching her Ivy Park clothing line video. And after, I was ready to run the world hit the gym! \nNEWS: Beyoncé's Lemonade Premieres This Weekend—Will She Drop Her New Album Then, Too? \nNow, I enjoy working out as much as the next carb-counter, but the truth is, replicating her moves is hard as hell. Watch as I attempt to get through her routine in the video below. \nPunching Bag: She makes it look so easy! After learning how to properly throw a jab, hook and cross punch and shuffle-step, I was in need of a water break after a solid six minutes. I did remember, though, to always keep my hands up to protect my face. You can't be flawless with a swollen lip. \nTreadmill: I considered myself athletic until my fitness instructor Michael DeGood added a full-on body chain around me and upped the speed. After sprinting for what seemed like an hour, I realized it was only two minutes and had to step off. Don't hate on the time until you've tried it. \nPHOTOS: Beyoncé's Best Looks \nRings Remember the sequence when she is hanging from the arm rings? Yeah, that's impossible. Take this piece of advice: Don't even try this part of the workout. Your confidence will thank you. \nRopes: For one whole minute, wave the ropes in different motions. It won't just work out those arms but also targets your core. Unfortunately, I didn't even try to do this two more times as instructed…because, well, it burned! \nDancing: Consider it 30 minutes of cardio and a perfect opportunity to flip my hair as much as possible. Hair flips in the rain, however, are slightly more difficult. When in doubt, cross your arms and look Sasha Fierce-ly into the horizon. \nStretching: Try this while the sun is setting, so right when you stretch out, a ray of sunshine hits your sweaty body and creates a glistening effect. Beyoncé really thought of everything. \nIt Comes Down to This: While many of us will try, there can only be one true Queen Bey. Her workout, very much like herself, is intense, magical and almost impossible to replicate. So, I may not be able to do it well but I can look damn good trying.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T22:19:41.501+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
