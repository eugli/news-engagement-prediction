Within three weeks, she saw a dramatic drop in the pH of the material, salt concentrations, residual hydrocarbons and naphthenic acids.  \n\n\"Mycelium is the vegetative part of fungi so this mycelium is able to branch down into the soil and just like mushrooms do in nature, it's able to digest and remediate the contaminants in that soil,\" said Anderson, who is now the founder of her own company, MycoRemedy. \n\n\"It breaks down the hydrocarbons.\" \nThese MycoMats, which are rolled out onto contaminated sites much like a piece of sod, are infused with enzymes which break down hydrocarbons. (MycoRemedy)\n\nAfter seven years of research and field trials, Miller-Anderson's method now takes the form of what she calls a \"myco mat.\"\n\nMuch like a piece of sod, the fungi-laden mats are laid out on top of the tailings, before releasing powerful enzymes that make a meal of the hydrocarbons.\nThe mats are biodegradable so there's no additional cleanup.\n\nUnlike current remediation methods — which usually involve the excavation and removal of contaminated soil —  her process is all natural and fast.\nOilsands reclamation a failure, says ecologist \n\"Essentially, you roll out the mat and leave it there to do its job. And it's very rapid. We had in our initial test results, in 21 days, elimination of hydrocarbons from the soil compared to most sites with the dig-and-dump method that take several years to complete.\"\n\nMiller-Anderson has won numerous awards for her work and has garnered widespread interest from the industry, including long-term research support from Syncrude and Alberta Innovates. Next week, she'll take her idea to the finals of the Global Student Entrepreneur Awards in Vancouver.\n'Something that nature is already doing' \nShe hopes to refine the method to ensure the fungi can reach even deeper into contaminated areas, with an eye to expand the application to gas stations and abandoned oil well sites.\n\nTo that end, she'll be conducting more field trials this summer and is confident her invention can help reverse some of the damage caused by the industry.\n\n\"It's really interesting to me because it's something that nature is already doing,\" she said. \"It's a natural solution, so it just seems like the best choice.\"\nWith files from Mark Harvey", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:09:50.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
