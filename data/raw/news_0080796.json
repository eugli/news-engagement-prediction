Look at the favorite comfort foods of his predecessors:\nBarack Obama: Loves Fran's Smoked Salted Caramels\nGeorge W. Bush: Cheeseburger pizza\nBill Clinton: Jalapeño cheeseburgers\nGeorge H.W. Bush: Pork rinds with Tabasco\nRonald Reagan: Jelly beans\nRichard Nixon: Cottage cheese with ketchup (shudder)\nHarry Truman: Steak, well-done\nTrump has never been a particularly healthy eater. During the campaign, he often filled up on junk food — Domino's, KFC and McDonald's. He reportedly enjoyed Big Macs served on silver trays on his private jet.\nSince being elected as the oldest president in U.S. history, the 70-year-old Trump has reverted to his regular meat-and-potatoes regimen, varying it occasionally with fish. It's doubtful the president follows government guidelines that dictate anywhere from 7 to 13 cups of produce daily.\nHis favorite snacks are Keebler Vienna Fingers and Lay's Potato Chips washed down with a Diet Coke, according to aide Quote: d by the news site Axios.\nWhat may be more disturbing than his diet is his lack of exercise. George W. Bush stayed in great condition by mountain-biking regularly, Reagan chopped wood and Obama was a workout junkie while in the White House. The most exercise Trump gets is on the golf course roughly once a week or less, and most of the time he rides in a cart.\nIn September, at a taping of \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" Trump apparently revealed that he weighs 236 pounds and stands 6-foot-3, according to the New York Daily News. But later it was reported that he's actually 267 pounds.\nThe would put his body mass index at either 29.5, at the upper end of the \"overweight\" scale, or 33.4, \"obese\" territory.\nTrump made his health an issue in 2015 when his doctor, Harold Bornstein, declared that Trump would \"be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hels/status/836193658797977600", "https://www.axios.com/trump-101-he-is-definitely-not-a-health-nut-2240700410.html", "http://ijr.com/2017/02/810965-trump-ditched-the-press-to-have-dinner-heres-how-the-president-acts-when-no-one-is-watching/", "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-officially-called-fat-donald-article-1.2792346", "https://t.co/jAQotAAAav", "https://twitter.com/PhreshTooDeaf/status/835986764812730368", "https://twitter.com/SABmetrics/status/836238695502123008"], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:14:55.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
