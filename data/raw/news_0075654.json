Source: FOX SPORTS \nAfterwards, Puel said video technology to decide offside decisions would be a good move in the future. \n“It was all the game unlucky because the first goal of Gabbiadini is a good goal,” said Puel. \n“He scored three good goals this afternoon. But the decision did not go for us. \n“I’m disappointed for the players and the fans. Just before the third goal we had the best situation and opportunities. It’s a big disappointment with the quality of this game.” Disgusting decision — Matt Le Tissier (@mattletiss7) February 26, 2017 \nAsked if he would like to see video technology introduced in future, Puel replied: “I would of course like the video for the future for these situations. But for the moment football is without video. Sometimes there is a bad decision against us and it is important to accept this.” Ibra wins EFL Final for Man U 1:34 \nIt costed Southampton a chance to lift their first major trophy since they beat United in the 1976 FA Cup final, but Puel was still proud of his side. \n“At 2-0 we came back with quality,” he said. “When you come back a second time it was good football with many chances. Perhaps we deserved better but it’s football and congratulations to Manchester United. \n“For them to have two shots and score two goals was very hard. We showed very good spirit to come back. \n“We were underdogs but now I think we can say it was a good thing to say it was possible to win.” 'I came, that's special'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:31:30.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
