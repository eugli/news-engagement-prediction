The dispute stems from Charter’s acquisition last year of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, which made it the nation’s second-largest cable operator behind Comcast Corp. Univision sued Charter last July in a dispute involving the post-merger contract terms. \nCharter could not immediately be reached for comment early Wednesday. \nMore to come ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T07:44:25.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
