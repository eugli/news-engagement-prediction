Track all the live action here PUNE: Farmers are highly disappointed with Budget 2017 alleging that the Prime Minister has not done enough to fulfill his pre-election promises made to the farming community. The announcement of increasing farm credit to 10 lakh crore may not help much the small and marginalised farmers, who are outside the banking network. \"About 60% of the farmers are outside the banking system. They depend upon the informal sector for loans. Unless the definition of priority sector lending is changed, it will not help the small and marginal farmers, the landless and the nomads,\" said P Chengal Reddy, secretary general, Consortium of Indian Farmers' Associations. He added, \"Farmers were promised that they will get a price of 50% above the cost of production, we were promised that the MNRGA will be linked with farming. The budget has not done anything to fulfill these promises.\" Representatives of farmers think that the government has not done enough to help the farmers, who have been affected adversely by demonetisation. \"The value chain of pastoral, fruit and vegetable farmers have been disturbed. There is nothing for the labourers who have returned from cities to their villages due to loss of jobs post-demonetisation,\" said Reddy. Reddy doubted the government's claim of 4.1% growth in agricultural GDP. \"In order to take credit for growth in agriculture, we should have increase in sales of fertilisers, seeds and irrigation facilities. We do not see any of these. Whatever increase in agriculture growth, it has come only due to the mercy of the rain Gods,\" he said.

The remarkable history of Budgets of 11 Budgets in the past 31 Jan, 2017 Text compiled by Vikram Doctor From being highly secretive to occasionally satirical & exceedingly lucid, Budgets have had a remarkable history. Here is a look at the Budgets in the past. First Indian Budget was presented by James Wilson 31 Jan, 2017 The first Indian Budget was presented by James Wilson on February 18, 1869. Wilson, whose designation was Finance Member of the India Council that advised the Indian Viceroy, was also the founder of The Economist and described by Karl Marx as an “economical mandarin of high standing.” But he was also a largely selftaught man who had worked in his family occupation making and selling hats, before becoming a scholar and a writer largely based on his brilliance and knowledge of economics and commerce. The Brit connection to Budget 31 Jan, 2017 Our Budget follows the UK Budget in many ways, including, for many years, timing, since it used to be held at 5:30 pm which was noon in the UK, and extreme secrecy, which may have been reinforced here by a scandal that broke out in the UK just as RK Shanmukham Chetty — the first FM — was preparing his first Budget. On Budget Day in the UK in 1947, Hugh Dalton, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, met a journalist when he walked into Parliament and mentioned a few details on tax changes he was planning. The journalist broke the story before the Speech. Dalton had to resign and this might have made Chetty all the more determined to maintain secrecy. First united-India Budget 31 Jan, 2017 Chetty was succeeded by John Mathai who, in 1949-50, delivered the most lucid Budget Speech as he took the decision not to read out all the details telling members that a White Paper with all details was being circulated. He then gave a mini lecture on inflation and economic policy. It was the first Budget for a really united India, since it included the financial statements for former Princely States and where the biggest news was the news of forming of Planning Commission and the need for having five-year plans Deshmukh’s Dilemma 31 Jan, 2017 The biggest problem for his successor, CD Deshmukh, was finding money for the Plans which meant higher taxes. In one Budget Speech he tried to buck up taxpayers with the story of a letter he claimed he had got from a villager who paid no taxes, but wanted to help. Deshmukh said, “He has remitted a sum of Rs 5 to me and has promised to remit a similar sum every year… so long as the common run of our people can produce men and women with this spirit, this country can face the future, however difficult it may be, with confidence.” It is not recorded if this made taxpayers happier to pay rather more than Rs 5.
