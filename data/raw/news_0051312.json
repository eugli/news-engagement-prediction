(Keri Young/Facebook) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   3:43 PM \nKeri Young and her husband, Royce, made the difficult decision to carry their unborn baby girl to full term although the fetus was diagnosed with a terminal illness. \nThe Oklahoma couple, parents to a son named Harrison, learned at Keri's 20-week ultrasound that their unborn daughter, named Eva, was suffering from anencephaly. \nAccording to the CDC, anencephaly is a condition that causes a baby to be born without parts of the brain or skull. Almost all babies born with the condition die shortly after birth. \nIn a lengthy Facebook post , Keri admitted she briefly considered inducing early ahead of her May 7 due date because she didn't want to go through the pain of losing her child. \nPaulina Gretzky and Dustin Johnson expecting second child \n\"Continuing the pregnancy meant we would have mourn the loss of a child,\" she wrote. \"We'd have to have a funeral... for a baby. OUR baby.\" An Oklahoma couple will donate their baby girl's organs after they learned the fetus has a terminal condition. (Keri Young/Facebook) \nHowever, at a follow-up doctor's appointment Keri and Royce were told that if they continued with the pregnancy some of Eva's organs - like her heart valves, kidneys and liver - could be donated. The unborn baby's lungs could be donated for research. \n\"Eva will have life even though it will be short,\" Keri wrote. \"She'll donate anything she can and do more in her time on earth than I ever will.\" \nIn an update on Friday , Royce wrote that the process has been difficult but through it all his wife has remained strong. \n'Today' co-host Hoda Kotb adopts baby girl \n\"Keri has been in the trenches the entire time, feeling every little kick, every hiccup, every roll. She's reminded every moment of every day that she's carrying a baby that will die,\" he posted. \n\"She's TOUGH. She's BRAVE. She's incredible. She's remarkable,\" he continued. \"She's cut from a different cloth, combining wit, beauty, courage silliness, character and integrity into one spectacular woman.\" Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:16:27.175+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
