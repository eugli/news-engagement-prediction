Editor Advertisement \nJust got caught by NEA-outsourced auxiliary officer. For \"smoking\" in \"non smoking\" area although I wasn't puffing on the cigarette and there was a bin full of cigarette butts in the non smoking area under shelter. So I didn't even know it was a non smoking area. \nI was smoking outside, then walked in under the shelter and was going to put my cigarette out on the bin, unfortunately I took one last puff before that and... in they swooped. Technically speaking, I had \"smoked\" in a non smoking area. \nLocation is at people's park, next to OG. These farkers stand there waiting for you to make ONE mistake. Damage: $200. Be warned. \nfatbastardx \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
