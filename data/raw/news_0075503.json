After a pair of hard-hit balls to the outfield, she took third on a wild pitch. Heather Bowen came through with a single to left for a 1-0 lead. \nDelilah Pacheco started the third with a single, moved up on a sacrifice bunt and then over to third on a grounder back to the circle. Once more, the Utes delivered with two outs as Anissa Urtez smoked a single to center. \nBridget Castro started the fifth with a walk and was lifted for pinch runner Ryley Ball. She moved up on a groundout and Barrera singled with two outs for a 3-0 edge. \nMeanwhile. Viramontes had faced the minimum through five thanks to Kelly Martinez gunning down a pair of UT baserunners and Urtez deftly turning a double play.
