Several consumers are now complaining and rushing to customer care centres claiming that the matte black variant’s paint is chipping off at the edges and back -- even when used with a protective case and a tempered glass on top. \nHowever, no such issue has been heard about the jet black colour variant. Reports quoted one user claiming that the phone sheds colour even when protected with a case. “I have been using iPhone 7 Plus Matte Black for about one month with fully covered by a TPU casing and full screen tempered glass most of the time. I just open the casing once a week to wipe the dust off from the phone... [but it] seems that the black anodised paint had been chipped off from the phone body,” the user was quoted from a statement in a forum. \nRead: Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone 8 may support wireless charging \nAdditionally, another user claims that his iPhone 7 Plus is just three weeks old, and it has already started chipping colour from the edges where the speaker resides. \nWhile the complains seem less in number, Apple might soon have a lot on its plate due to the chipping paint complaint. The iPhone-maker is yet to respond to the complaints. \nHowever, this is not the first time that Apple is facing such an issue. The iPhone 5 was the last phone to have a similar issue and at that time VP Phil Schiller had said that aluminium products are prone to scratches and chips and that ‘it is normal’, and had cancelled out the issue there and then. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:57.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
