'Ever since I was young there was something about Britney Spears and the qualities she had that I thought was the perfect package. Bryan picutred with ths singer when they met for the first time on vacation in Hawaii Bryan picture directly before a lip filler procedure: He has his lips plumped frequently to avoid looking older, as well as to resemble Britney Spears 'I was obsessed, I watched all her interviews, learned all her choreography and then paid to have the same perfect smile as, I felt that during that time we were very similar. 'In the beginning, I was trying to look like Britney Spears, my surgeons who designed my veneers asked me which celebrity smile I wanted to base mine on and it was hers. 'Now with my looks, I want to get into modelling, I love impersonating Britney Spears so I want to continue doing that and see where it takes me. The super fan, who also performs as Britney Spears, is pictured dressed up as the singer with a long wig 'I used to perform in west Hollywood, doing songs and numbers - it's still something I want to do in the future. 'When I was younger, I did it a lot more, now I'm older I still dress up, make music videos, do lip syncing to her songs and constantly have her music playing in the background. 'So many people refer to me as 'Britney' and for a very long time friends have greeted me with her infamous quote 'It's Britney, b****!' from her song 'Gimme More' which I absolutely love. In his bid to look like Britney, Bryan has had a nose job, fat injected into his cheeks, lip fillers, botox and laser hair removal surgery 'Britney will always be one of my biggest inspirations, I love that she was the biggest star in the world went through an incredibly hard time and came out on top.' Bryan has met his idol three times - including during her infamous meltdown of 2007. He added: 'It was amazing meeting her, I went into a little outdoor flea market in Hawaii and heard a really small, very soft spoken voice with a southern accent behind me. Bryan two weeks after the rhinoplasty he had to copy Britney Spears' nose 'I've never been more nervous, I was face to face with my biggest idol and inspiration, she was completely not glammed stripped of make-up, very real and so gorgeous. 'My eyes zoomed in on her teeth, they were just as beautiful in her photos and music videos, she was the sweetest person. 'The next time I met her she was going through a dark period and was speaking in a British accent while waiting in line at a pharmacy, she acknowledged me but wasn't too friendly. 'Then I also met her again at a club called Tiger Heat in the VIP lounge when she was there with her boyfriend of the time, where she was very sweet.' No pain, no gain: The super fan after laser hair removal surgery on his face and neck Bryan who is determined to look young forever, claims not to have any wrinkles and believes procedures have prevented him from aging. The self-confessed 'human doll' believes he doesn't look 'a day over 17' thanks to his routine of laser hair treatment every two months, Botox every five months and lip fillers four times a year. Bryan said: 'One of my primary goals is to preserve my youth for as long as possible, I don't want any facial or body hair as it will age me. 'I've fully avoided wrinkles, Botox has been my best friend throughout my journey to prevent aging, even today people think I'm younger than I am. Bryan with Marcela Iglesias one of two producers of the show The Plastics of Hollywood, where Bryan and others will attempt to find fame outside of the world of plastic surgery 'I'm very proud of my age, when people ask me how old I am, I tell them the truth because I'm not ashamed and have been on this journey since I was 17. 'I also have a full skin care routine and stay out of the sun completely, thanks to it all I've managed not to age at all and maintain my youth.' Bryan is set to features in new show tentatively called 'Plastics of Hollywood', based on a talent and modelling agency for real life human dolls. The show set to be released in the US, will feature Bryan and others trying to achieve fame, through their talent rather than from their looks and the plastic surgery they have had. Bryan flashes his best Britney smile: He started emulating the 'Hit Me Baby, One More Time' singing superstar at 17, when he had veneers to match her grin Marcela Iglesias, Producer of the show, said: 'I love the fact that he's so much into Britney Spears, he sings and performs as her, even his teeth were inspired by her. 'It's one thing to perform Britney because he's so familiar with what she does and how she moves and performs, but if I had him perform as Cher could he act like her. 'In the training process, we will test him and everyone else to see if they can do a scene.' The show features Marcela Iglesias and Patrik Simpson will try to help them become Hollywood Stars. Marcela added: 'We want to help these living cartoons and human dolls to achieve their dreams in Hollywood, because of the way they look and appear people don't believe in them they do, we're showing them everybody has a chance at fame. 'When we did a casting call, Bryan showed up and I was surprised how well he looked, I thought he was 16 or 17, so to realise he was in his thirties was a shock. 'He's more like a living doll because of the way he looks, he looks very angelical to be honest, he will be the ageless man.'
