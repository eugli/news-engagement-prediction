The poultry industry is in crisis. \nRetailers across the country could see fewer free range two million fewer eggs per day from March 1, once a government housing order is lifted on February 28. The whole thing is largely down to bird flu fears. \nAs a nation, we love eggs . In 2015 The Grocer found that consumption had increased by 9.6 per cent year-on-year. \nAround 700,000 eggs are eaten every day in Britain – nearly ten per cent of us choose them for breakfast. Instagram is about to suffer (Photo: Getty) Read More \nThe government is lifting housing restrictions for farmers in areas it believes are low risk (of disease). Farmers in high risk parts of the country, however, will be downgraded to barn or colony eggs – i.e. not free range. \nPut very simply, it's a mess . A total shambles, frankly. \nSome farmers will see their production methods changed, their marketing disrupted. And it means retailers might see, for a short time at least, fewer eggs come into stock. \nThe poultry industry says it will put pressure on the price of both barn and colony egg prices as free range eggs are cascaded down into their categories, Farming UK has warned. Egg packers apparently fear they'll have to pay free range prices for 'colony' eggs. Hen farmers are all aflutter (Photo: Getty) Read More The one mistake everyone makes when cooking boiled eggs – and how to cook them perfectly \n\"To allow the marketing of eggs as free range, a producer now faces a race against time to put in place previously unthinkable measures to secure the marketing status of their product,\" Farming UK says. \nNigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer for DEFRA, updated the agricultural industry earlier this month. He split the country into High and Higher Risk Areas. \nAbout 75 per cent of farms are deemed Low Risk. Producers in these will be able to maintain free range status – but will need to ensure their hens are supervised, or outdoor coups covered with netting. We'll still have eggs, but farmers are struggling (Photo: The Image Bank) \nHigher Risk Areas must be covered with netting. It's farmers from these that have condemned the government plans, as 25 per cent of all free range eggs come from these areas. \nAll this affects England primarily, as Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland all have slightly different farming practices. However, the issues impact all UK farmers in some way. \nFarmers are asking for \"common sense\" from DEFRA. About two million eggs come from housed hens every day – supermarkets each sell about 2.2million per week – and the barn market is described as \"desperate\". Worrying: the thought of no scrambled eggs (Photo: Getty images) Read More The one crucial rule for perfect poached eggs – and it's not vinegar \nIt means retailers could be seriously stretched as a result. And an industry resolution, as it stands, has not been found. \nIt's highly unlikely we'll see totally eggless shelves. But in 2016, free range accounted for about 50 per cent of all eggs consumed in the UK, so the situation is definitely eggy. The country's self-sufficiency is about 85 per cent. \nMirror Online is waiting for a response from DEFRA. We've also asked supermarkets if they plan to implement price rises for eggs.
