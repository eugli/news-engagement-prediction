He scored a staggering 92 points in a 146-123 victory over visiting Los Osos. \nHere are the numbers, per USA Today : He made 37 for 57 field goal attempts and was 11 of 14 from the free throw line. For good measure, he also had seven assists and five rebounds. In one quarter alone he dropped 41 points. \n“He loves to score,” Ball’s father, Lavar, said, per ABC News . \nLaMelo reportedly dedicated his performance to a young woman who is seriously ill in the hospital. \nChino Hills Coach Stephan Gilling called the performance “very exciting.” But opposing coach Dave Smith wasn’t having it: “The Ball boys are very talented and great players, but it’s embarrassing to high school athletics,” he told the Times. “I’ve been coaching for 35 years, and we’ve turned high school athletics into individualism.” \nIncidentally, older brother Lonzo Ball is currently a star freshman at UCLA who may be heading toward the NBA next year. \nChino Hills’ 60-game winning streak had been stopped by the previous game, prompting Lonzo to send out this tweet Tuesday night: Well I mean that's one way to bounce back after a loss... I see you lil bro 9️⃣2️⃣ — Lonzo Ball (@ZO2_) February 8, 2017 \nThe high school single-game scoring record is thought by many to be 135 , set in 1960 by Danny Heater of Burnsville High School in West Virginia.
