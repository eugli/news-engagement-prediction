For others, he said, “we will have a short phase-in period to make sure that people on the other end don’t get on airplanes.”\nHe did not elaborate on whether this would apply to green card holders as well.\nAmong the security challenges, Kelly said, was that the U.S. does not have “strong counter-terrorism partnerships” with the countries in question or “robust information on individuals traveling from these countries” to be able to make a good risk assessments before their citizens traveled to the United States.\nThe nations affected by the original ban were Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Kelly mentioned “seven nations” again on Saturday, leading to speculation they will all be included in Trump’s next executive order.\nThe U.S. needs to “find ways to vet in a more reliable way to satisfy us that the people that are coming to the United States are, in fact, coming for the right reasons,” he said.\nAsked about the effectiveness of a blanket ban on seven countries, fellow panelist Thomas de Maiziere, Germany’s top security official, suggested it could be counter-productive.\n“To ban whole countries perhaps could create more collateral damage, and perhaps does not produce more security,” he said. “The more precise you do it, the more effective you are.”\nStory by the Associated Press; curated by Chris Enloe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:07:18.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
