I'm proud of the NFL's Whitest team,\" he added in another tweet. \nEven as his comments prompted angry responses online - including a gif of Spencer getting socked in the face - he continued his Twitter rant. \n\"For the white race, it's never over,\" he wrote with a gif of Brady locking lips with his wife, Gisele Bundchen. \n\"Someone needs to get punched,\" responded one Twitter user, referencing the now-famous footage of Spencer getting sucker-punched mid-interview at President Donald Trump's inauguration. \nSpencer, founder of the National Policy Institute, sparked controversy last year when he spoke at Texas A&M University, although the College Station school clarified repeatedly that he was invited by an alum and not the university itself. \nThe event drew enthusiastic protests and a flurry of online petitions asking the school to rescind Spencer's invite. \n\"We won,\" Spencer said at the December event, even as more than 1,000 people chanted and shouted their opposition outside.
