He left his phone with the son and picked the food up and walked out onto the road - we know he was observant. \n\"He was clearly visible to the driver and that’s when the driver ran him over. \n“At that time he didn’t know what the situation was but it was witnessed by his son who has had to phone his mum and his uncle to tell them.” \nShocking CCTV footage filmed in the moments immediately after the collision shows the killer hit-and-run driver mounting the pavement and speeding through red lights. \nThe driver of the car, registration number KW55 EVP, can be seen racing down Stockport Road and stopping to let a hooded passenger out. \nThe Peugeot 307 then speeds off down the main road towards the junction with Kirkmanshulme Lane where it turns right.

He would have helped out anyone and whenever you needed him he was there. \n“It’s very hard to take in. There is nothing we can say that was bad about him at all. He was loved by everyone and liked by everyone. \n“He was a very happy chappy type person and was always there for other people. \n“The main thing is he was a very, very devoted family man to his wife and children. His kids loved him to bits.” \nMaking an emotional appeal for the driver of the car to hand himself in Shabuddin said: “It’s a shock to everyone that it’s happened at such a young age to a man with a young family. \n“All I want is for the driver to be caught and brought to justice.” \nDetectives investigating the collision have vowed to catch the driver of the car and say they will not rest until the person is brought to justice.
