He was shot by gunmen believed to have been sent by the North. \nKim Jong-un is no less brutal than his father and grandfather, as evidenced by the shocking execution of his uncle Jang Song-thaek who had been regarded as the No.2 man in the power hierarchy, in 2013. \nThat was two years after Kim took power upon the death of his father, and Jang’s execution was largely seen as a move to thwart any challenges to his leadership by fortifying his reign of terror. \nKim is believed to have executed about 140 members of the country’s ruling elite, including relatives and former key aides to his father, since he took power in 2011. \nAll those cases are related to Kim’s efforts to magnify fear of his rule and force submission. \nNorth Korea watchers say the past cases and the killing of Kim Jong-nam indicate that Kim Jong-un is as unpredictable and ruthless as his father and grandfather. \nLee of the NIS said that the latest assassination shows that Kim is captivated by a sense of paranoia. \nThis means that a young paranoiac man who is so inhumane, ruthless and brutal also has in his hands what is believed to be in the final stage of deliverable nuclear bombs. \nKim Jong-nam’s assassination came one day after North Korea test-fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the first such provocation since the start of the Trump administration in the US. \nLee of the NIS, noting that the North had been trying to kill Kim Jong-nam for five years, said that the two events are not related. But these latest developments oblige us to keep closer tabs on the North.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:57:12.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
