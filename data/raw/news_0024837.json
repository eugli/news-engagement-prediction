For them to choose to arrest her on Friday and drive around with her for the sole reason of keeping her for the weekend shows intimidation.\"\nSpies said AfriForum was considering taking the matter to the High Court.\nEarlier on Friday, O'Sullivan told News24 that police raided his home in Johannesburg.\nHe said the doorbell rang at his house in Sandton at 16:15. He said when he opened it, there was a female metro police officer who asked to be let in.\nO’Sullivan said the woman said she needed information on his vehicle, which was apparently involved in a hit and run two weeks ago. He said he told her he sold it about a year ago.\nO’Sullivan said he had a bad feeling about the situation, got into his car and drove away. He said as he left, he saw a convoy of unmarked vehicles coming toward his house.\nHe said the cars tried to block him off but he drove away.\nPhahlane is seeking to interdict O’Sullivan from being involved in IPID investigations against him, News24 reported.\nThe papers were on Monday served on the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID), O’Sullivan, Sarah Trent, and Magistrate JR Tsatsi.\nPhahlane says O’Sullivan has been targeting him and has the ear of IPID head Robert McBride. Phahlane denies any wrongdoing.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=1296608660&t=artid%3d890e98de-5d27-42ad-b1ef-4a5cb5e3790d%26Companies%3dpolice%2cafriforum%26People%3dpaul+o%27sullivan%26Places%3djohannesburg%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=1296608660&t=artid%3d890e98de-5d27-42ad-b1ef-4a5cb5e3790d%26Companies%3dpolice%2cafriforum%26People%3dpaul+o%27sullivan%26Places%3djohannesburg%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1"], "published": "2017-02-10T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:31:10.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
