Plenty of ice, temps in the 50’s, scattering of good reports and just an overall good experience. Travel being great, the only issue being the need for knee high boots and creepers as things got slick. Crappies: Very Good – Weather being perfect for tip-downs – holes not freezing and not much wind – anglers targeting crappies had a lot of success using tip-downs and rosies. Anglers slow dropping rocker jigs (#10 gold or white) tipped with plastics (white, yellow, pink) did extremely well – especially late afternoons. Yellow Perch: Very Good – The deep bite has been good using Pimples, Halis, Kastmasters and Demon Tounges tipped with wigglers or red spikes. Depths of 22-32’ best with some real nice perch of 11-13” coming from the big clear lakes. A shallow bite is also occurring, cabbage flats of 7-10’ producing nice catches. Here minnows, minnow heads or several waxies on Northland Forage Fry has been producing as these fat perch have been feeding heavily on young of year bluegills of about 1-1 ½” long. Northern Pike: Good-Very Good – Seemed a slow start, but action picked up for tip-up anglers using large shiners for bait. Bluegills: Good-Very Good – With warm weather anglers moved about and scored good catches dropping dark colored Fiska, darts and Moon Glow jigs tipped with moussees, waxies or black, purple or red plastic tails. Walleyes: Fair-Good – A little more participation helped the reports, though later at night came the best bites. With walleye sized suckers being hard to come by, anglers resorted to chubs, shiners and even large fatheads on Glass Eye jigs to score. Only two weekends left for the inland lakes gamefish season. The warmth, plus rain Monday took the snow cover down to bare ice. Travel is great, though a few south facing launches will have to be watched. Ice thickness started out Friday at about 20-21” average. Still in 18”+ range as of Tuesday (2/21). Heavy snow for Thursday will complicate travel for ATV’s. Caution advised anywhere you go.
