I also hope Gita Mehta writes again. What genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid? Historical fiction, particularly detective fiction, and contemporary detective stories set outside New York City, perhaps because I don’t want even the most realistically rendered stories to intrude on my lived, quotidian reality. That said, I might be tempted to move to Three Pines, the setting for Louise Penny’s wonderful Armand Gamache books. I adore Barbara Nadel’s Inspector Ikmen series; Donna Leon’s Commissario Brunetti novels; the adventures of Arturo Pérez-Reverte’s Captain Alatriste; and everything the mother-son team of Charles Todd writes — I love both their Inspector Rutledge and Bess Crawford books. Jacqueline Winspear’s Maisie Dobbs has a special home in my heart, as her books were the last I shared with my grandmother in our book club of three (with my mom) before she passed away. I just finished Deborah Crombie’s “Garden of Lamentations,” the most recent Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James novel, and stayed up far too late for someone who has to wake up early to breast-feed my son, Aidan. But it was just that good a story and that good a read. I hope Julia Spencer-Fleming writes more Reverend Clare Fergusson/Russ Van Alstyne books, and I hope someone will discover a previously unknown P. D. James Commander Dalgliesh book. I avoid most fiction in which children are harmed or seriously threatened in any way. What are the best books about global health? “The Ghost Map” is a terrific read about how John Snow’s work on cholera in London in the 19th century changed epidemiology and science forever. “House on Fire” — not the Sia song, as much as I’m a fan — tells the story of how the world eradicated smallpox within a few decades, one of global health’s signature successes. Anything Paul Farmer, Peter Piot, Laurie Garrett or Larry Gostin have written I think is essential reading for understanding where we are in global health today — and why we aren’t farther along in the fights against ancient threats like tuberculosis or in containing relatively newer threats like Zika. “Turning the World Upside Down,” by Nigel Crisp, focuses on the lessons we in the “developed world” could learn from the “developing world” on public health protection and health care delivery — and while it was published in 2010, I think his analysis and recommendations remain relevant to our challenges today. Finally, “And the Band Played On” is an extraordinary book and an extraordinarily painful one to read, but vital to understanding the early fight against H.I.V.-AIDS in the U.S. — and it’s particularly essential now, as we may confront efforts to roll back H.I.V.-AIDS prevention and treatment efforts, and we need to remember — and remind people in power — the human cost of negligence, of ignorance, and that a failure to engage in public health strategies we know work is ultimately a moral failure. And which book do you wish all American children would read? My daughter, Charlotte, loves books that fire her imagination and make her laugh — “Waiting”; “Last Stop on Market Street”; “Click, Clack, Moo”; “Edward the Emu”; “Hippos Go Berserk!”; “Good Night, Gorilla”; the Fancy Nancy series; the Llama Llama books; anything by Mo Willems; anything by Eric Carle — all are household favorites at the moment, but if Charlotte had to choose one book right now, I think it would be Oliver Jeffers’s “How to Catch a Star.” I want every child to be exposed to lots of books so they can have the many rotating favorites Charlotte is lucky enough to have — and to find what inspires them most, makes them most giggle and what makes them want to read more. I can’t wait to find out what books Aidan will most enjoy — right now he smiles at all of them. How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night? I read constantly when I’m not with my family or working — and sometimes even when I’m with my family, if my husband is already asleep (he is right now: shhh) or if I am breast-feeding my son and I need to be quiet, as if I make a sound or move he will sweetly get distracted and want to talk (O.K. — babble) and play. Sometimes, though, he will stare into my eyes while he’s eating, and I would choose that moment of connection over any book, really over anything. I read both on paper and electronically, though more of the latter now that I am picking up my 2-year-old daughter and 8-month-old son, sometimes simultaneously, so I try to limit how much I lug around in my bag. What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves? Marc loves science fiction, and candidly, “loves” seems rather too mild a description. “A Wrinkle in Time” endures 25 years after my first reading as a true favorite for me, but since I tend toward contemporary and historical fiction, and nonfiction, with some plays and poetry, I think my friends might be surprised to see all the science fiction on our shelves and on our Kindle. But, I guess after reading this, it won’t be a surprise any longer! And after writing this, I think I need to rediscover what made me love science fiction so much as a younger reader. Will ask Marc for recommendations when he wakes up. Currently it is 2a.m., so sleeping is a very reasonable thing to be doing right now. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
