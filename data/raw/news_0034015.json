By Kevin Kirkland   \nDon’t try to tell Joseph Evancho of Turtle Creek to slow down. At age 99, he decided to repair and refinish his redwood porch furniture last summer. He succeeded, although his children drew the line at the nearly 100-year-old man cutting wood with a power saw. \nHe was born on Aug. 10, 1916, in Wilmerding and graduated from Union High School (now Woodland Hills Academy). On June 21, 1937, he married his high school sweetheart, Elizabeth Figulski, at St. Colman Catholic Church. They had four children: Connie Morenzi and Marci Mason, both of Turtle Creek; Margie Tinsley of Monroeville; and Bill Evancho of Pine. His 16 grandchildren include singer Jackie Evancho. He also has 30 great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren. \nAt age 18, Mr. Evancho started working for an A&P grocery store. He later managed several A&P stores in the Turtle Creek Valley, retiring after more than 50 years. After retirement, he worked for four years for the Woodland Hills School District. \n“From manager to janitor,” his wife teased him. “Custodian, Mother,” was his reply. \nMrs. Evancho died in 2011 after 74 years of marriage. \nIf you or a friend or a relative recently turned 100 or will soon do so, the Post-Gazette would like to hear from you.
