He builds great brands and he’s a perfect addition to Battery. I couldn’t be more proud to have him on board.” \nBrown joins Battery from TBWA\\Chiat\\Day, where he has spent the past 15 years working with brands including Pepsi, Twitter, Airbnb, Netflix, Southwest Airlines, Visa, Nissan and Infiniti. \n“The second I walked into Battery I knew it was a special place,” Brown said. “There’s a feeling of freedom that’s pervasive in all the work and an immediate comradery that feels like home. It very much feels like my early days at Chiat where I witnessed magic being made on a daily basis.” \nHwang joined Battery as an integrated creative director and copywriter in January of 2015 and has worked with brands including Lego, Mike’s Hard Lemonade and Mortal Kombat X. He previously spent six years as an integrated creative director with Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles, where he worked with brands such as Toyota, Square Enix and Surfrider Foundation, before leaving to join Beats by Dre as a freelance integrated creative director and copywriter in March of 2014. Before Saatchi & Saatchi he spent eight years as a copywriter with TBA\\Chiat\\Day. \n“It’s exciting to see the Battery family grow,” Hwang said. “Since day one, we’ve made it a point to recognize big ideas and the people that make them happen. I couldn’t be happier about the promotion and the fact that Scott is part of the team. He and I go way back and I’m looking forward to doing big things together.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:10:30.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
