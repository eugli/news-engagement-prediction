Till Sunday evening, when TOI broke the news of Raj Chakrabarty and Mimi Chakraborty���s impending breakup on the website, it was just a hush-hush gossip doing the rounds. After all, the actress and the director had never owned up to their relationship, even though it was an open secret. After CT reported that there might be a third man, whom Mimi met on her trip to Turkey, accounts of sources close to the two started pouring in. Turns out, Mimi���s Turkey trip came as a bolt from the blue for a happy couple. The trip had started out very normally, but it snowballed when Mimi met Melih G��lhan K��z��lkaya, a 20-year-old, part of Gangster���s (Birsa Dasgupta���s film) local crew from Turkey.\nOne of the sources, close both to Raj Chakrabarty and Mimi Chakraborty, said, ���Raj went to drop Mimi at the airport when she was leaving for Turkey. Everything was fine between them. Raj then flew off to Italy to shoot for Abhiman. However, Mimi���s calls and messages to Raj became fewer as the days went on. When Raj would call, Mimi would either make excuses or shout at him rudely. Raj was going through a rough patch, as two of his serials had gone off air at that time and his mother was hospitalised. But Mimi never cared or bothered to enquire about his mother, though she is very close to her. Raj realised something was wrong, but had no idea what was going on. He only came to know about Melih, when people from Birsa���s team in Turkey informed him about his growing closeness to Mimi. However, Mimi denied everything and claimed that Melih was just a good friend.���\nA little background check reveals that a year back, Mimi had been to Turkey to shoot for Birsa Dasgupta���s previous film, Sudhu Tomari Jonnyo. It was there that she met Mileh, the son of local line producer Ilhan Kzlky. Raj had an issue with it and they had a huge fight. But things returned to normal once Mimi completed the shoot and came back to Kolkata. But, it seems, that wasn���t the end.\nThe source adds, ���Raj would call Mimi constantly and try to convince her that she had no future with the young man. But Mimi was in no mood to listen, since she was on cloud nine, dating this much younger guy. One day, Raj came to know that Mimi and Melih were out together all day, and she came back to the hotel in an inebriated state. When he confronted Mimi about it, she promised never to repeat this mistake again. But things went only downhill from there, and the entire team in Turkey could make out that Mimi had fallen for Melih. When friends tried to dissuade Mimi from engaging with Melih, she snubbed them saying it was her personal matter and nobody was supposed to have any say in it. When, one day, Raj requested to talk to her and the entire unit in Turkey, including the local crew, on FaceTime, Mimi denied point blank. Supposedly, Raj wanted her to introduce him to the local crew as her boyfriend and Mimi was in no mood to do that. Disappointed, Raj then blocked Mimi on WhatsApp. Mimi then called Nusrat, saying that Raj had blocked her. On Nusrat���s insistence, Raj unblocked her, and Mimi messaged that they would sort it out once she came back from Turkey. Raj, in reply, sent her a long, emotional voice message. But, when Mimi paid no heed to it, Raj realised that their relationship was over. So, he confronted her again and this time told her that he had proof of her closeness to Melih. That is when Mimi broke down and confessed that she had fallen for Melih Kizilkayah. ���Yes, I have fallen in love with him. What can I do? Aami to bhagoban noi. Tumi aamay Bhagoban kore rekhecho!��� she supposedly told Raj.���\nAnother source from the team added, ���Mimi and the line producer���s son would go out for dinner and take efforts to sit together. But I thought it was just an infatuation!���\nMimi with Melih Kizilkayah in Turkey\nWell, that is exactly what Raj thought too, until the facts hit him where it hurts. Now that both the director and actress are back in town, industry sources say that Mimi is blaming Raj for their breakup. She claims that Raj could not give the relationship enough time and that took a toll on her. ���We broke up, but that doesn���t mean I am dating a guy in Turkey. I am not that stupid. Raj and I broke up as our relation didn���t match up to our expectations and not because of any third person. And tell me, is making a new friend a crime? Really! One year back, When Raj struck a friendship with someone, who I don���t want to name (read Koushani), I did not have a problem. And I don���t really want to speak about it, as I respect Raj as a person and I am sure he will not pay heed to such nonsense. He will always be special in my life. We have parted ways on a good note,��� the actress told us. Raj, on the other hand, has dealt with it in a graceful manner. However, he still can���t believe the overall change in Mimi���s behaviour. ���Mimi has all the right to love someone. But she could have talked to me directly about it instead of cooking up stories. That would have been so much more matured and we could have ended things in a respectful manner. I wish her all the best. My only regret is, she failed to respect even the friendship we had, let alone the relationship. I was always by her side, during her tough times and I thought she would be too, but then, what can I say..,��� a visibly distraught Raj said.\nThe couple during happier times\nHer rudeness has come as a shock to the director, and he has not been able to break this news to his mother yet, since the two women were really close. Once back in Kolkata, Mimi had messaged Raj to meet in person, but Raj denied, as he had nothing more to say.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T19:22:32.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
