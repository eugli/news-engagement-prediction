He studied for a Bachelor of Sport and Recreation at AUT. GEOFF DOBSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe keen sportsman has represented New Zealand in the K2 1000m. \nDescribing himself as a \"laid-back Kiwi bloke\", Franich is ready for whatever the future may bring. \n\"I've always stood by the fact that life should be an adventure and you should take every opportunity you're given. When someone offers you the chance to meet beautiful and interesting women, travel the world, and hopefully find love at the end – it was a no-brainer,\" Franich said in a statement provided by Mediaworks. \nFranich even revealed what he was hoping for from his perfect match. ROSS MALYON/FAIRFAX NZ \nFranich is pictured competing in the open men's ski race. \n\"I really don't have a type; every woman has something special about them. I don't want to go into this experience with a list of must-haves. I'm keeping an open mind and hope to find that spark with someone who shares some of my passions for travel, adventure, the ability to laugh and have fun.\" Ad Feedback \nThe self confessed kook also said: \"Bonus points if they like black liquorice. All good if not, more for me.\" \nSue Woodfield, MediaWorks Head Of Commissioning and External Production, said: \"Zac was chosen because he ticks all the boxes. \n\"He's handsome, sporty and accomplished, a real Kiwi guy with a great sense humour. He's the boy next door that you'd take home to meet the parents and most importantly – he's genuinely looking to meet someone special. We wish him all the best in his quest for love.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:05:26.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
