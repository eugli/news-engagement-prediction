PUBLISHED: 16:33, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 | UPDATED: 17:18, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 \nThe events which allegedly happened to Travis Walton 41 years ago are one of the world's most infamous so-called alien abduction cases. \nBut, it now appears he may not actually have been abducted after all - but instead rescued. \nThe twist in the story has been revealed by UFO researcher JP Robinson, after a meeting with Mr Walton at an alien conference. \nThe case began in November 1975 in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, near Phoenix, Arizona, when six forestry worker colleagues of Mr Walton's reported him missing after they allegedly saw him get blasted back 20 feet by an energy beam from a UFO that \"appeared over the trees”. \nOfficers thought it was an elaborate cover up and that they had actually killed him and disposed of the body. \nBut five days later he turned-up, saying he had been abducted by aliens and had been forced to punch his way out. \nHe relayed what happened in his book Fire In The Sky which was turned into a Hollywood movie of the same name in 1993. \nHe claims to have seen three grey aliens on the UFO, and later, human-looking beings described as \"smooth-skinned and blemish-less\". \nNow, Mr Robinson has relayed the new details on his website. \nHe wrote: \"I was never convinced of the authenticity of this incident, not to say I didn't believe it, just that you can never be wholly sure. \n\"All that changed when I met Travis Walton… and got the fantastic opportunity to speak face to face with the man who claims to have met beings from another world, and try to figure out whether he is for real or just a really good liar!

Travis told me that he believed that he was actually dead. \n\"So now we get to the real question which so many people ask...why did they take him on board? Well, according to the man himself, they took him in order to save his life - and this they clearly succeeded in doing.\" \nMr Robinson said the story now had a \"more legitimate tone\".
