In addition to a bevy of new eateries, including Paul Qui’s Aqui , Chi’Lantro , and Dolce Neve ( among others ), a popular Austin bar is officially en route. A website and Facebook page created for Handlebar Houston announce the boozy new arrival. The self-described “adult wonderland” will take over the former GlassDoor nightclub space at 5219 Washington Ave, bringing a neighborhood bar with an “old school vibe” to the area. It isn’t the bar’s first visit to Houston, either. In 2015, bartenders from the Austin outpost took over Royal Oak in celebration of mustache-themed fundraiser Movember. Notably, Handlebar maintains that there will be no cheeky mustache decor in the new bar, but revelers can look forward to a selection of local beers, craft cocktails, games, and even a photo booth in which guests can take photos of their own mustaches. Or other things, presumably. HandleBar Houston is set to make its debut on March 31 if all goes according to plan.
