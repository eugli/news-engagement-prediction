In fact, it is the purest donation of all.”\nHe also noted that opposition leader, Bill Shorten, had received a $40,000 donation from a construction labour hire company, which he only declared when it was discovered by the trade union royal commission.\nThe treasurer, Scott Morrison, hit back at Chalmers in an interview with Radio National, labelling the claim Turnbull had “bought” the election a “grubby political smear” from a “political hack”. He challenged Shorten to repeat the claim.\nMorrison also noted unions had donated $20m to the Labor party, which he said amounted to Shorten “putting his hand into the pocket of every union member in the country” to fund Labor’s campaign.\nSpeaking on Radio National after Morrison, Chalmers said it would come as “no surprise” to voters that unions, the industrial wing of the labour movement, donated to the Labor party, the political wing.\n“The point we’re making is that the prime ministership ... should be determined by the person who has the better policies for this country, not the person who has the most zeroes on their bank balance,” he said.\nChalmers accepted that politicians are allowed to make personal political donations, and that state and federal Labor MPs pay a levy of 4-6% of their salaries to their Labor branches.\nBut he said Turnbull’s was the biggest personal political donation in history.\nChalmers said the Australian people would ultimately judge whether it was good for democracy “that one of the leaders can find $1.75m down the back of the couch to spray around in the dying days of the election”.\nHe said Turnbull must himself think the donation was “pretty dodgy or it wouldn’t have taken seven months for the figure to be dragged out of him”.\nOn Wednesday Turnbull addressed donation reform in his first major speech for 2017 at the National Press Club, suggesting that the current disclosure rules were a result of historical administration requirements.\nHe said he would have no objection to more timely donation reforms and said it was a matter for the joint standing committee on electoral matters, which is examining political donations .\nTurnbull agreed in principle that public information should be disclosed “more promptly or in as close to real time as possible”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:10:52.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
