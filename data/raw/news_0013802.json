Strangely, this is the fourth case of polyemia that the hospital has treated in the past 10 years, including a 2008 case where a girl was born with four legs and four arms. \nDr. Rao told CNN that the presence of the extra twin complicated the surgery. “Because the anatomy is not typical, a lot of work had to be done before the operation to clearly define the anatomy, what structures are shared between the parasitic twin and the main baby, the blood vessels need to be identified to control blood loss so there was a lot of pre-operative work to build a road map that would help us during the operation,” he said. \nCNN reports the boy will be discharged in the next week, and Narayana will cover his follow-up surgery care for free.
