The Charterhouse monastery , which became a charitable foundation and is still in operation, was founded to pray for the souls of the dead. \nThe skeletons were found when archaeologists from the Museum of London Archaeology excavated a small circular pit where a shaft was sunk for the Crossrail tunnel, on the edge of Charterhouse Square. \nResearch continues on the bones of 25 individuals, but the DNA extracted from several of the skeletons revealed exposure to the pathogen that caused the plague, Yersinia pestis, and the archaeologists assume all the dead were victims of the outbreak. \nThe two men were buried in the third and final layer of graves dating to the early 15th century. A skull from one of the older graves, presumably disturbed by the gravediggers, was reburied beside them. \nArchaeologist Sam Pfizenmaier, who led the excavation and wrote a newly published book on Charterhouse Square finds, said: “One possible interpretation is that they were related in some way, for example by blood or marriage.” \nHe added that since no trace of coffins or shrouds was found, the position of their arms could have been accidental. \nThe older man had a healed fracture in his arm, possible evidence of a defensive injury from an assault. \nThe site also yielded a mass of well-preserved Tudor material, including leather and textile fragments, originally rubbish thrown into a stream running behind the houses. \nMost of the course of Faggeswell brook was destroyed when the Metropolitan Line underground network was dug in the 19th century. However one small stretch survived, its contents preserved because they were buried in damp soil when the stream was filled in the 17th century, presumably because by then it had become a noisome open drain. \nThe items included 22 leather shoes – one made for a child – an ornate strap and buckle from a horse harness, scraps of a slashed silk doublet, woven silk decorative bands that were luxury imports from Spain and Italy, and evidence of an extravagant diet including Grains of Paradise – a name invented as a marketing ploy for black pepper imported from west Africa. \nSome of the finds, including one of the skeletons, will be on display in the Museum of London Docklands until September.
