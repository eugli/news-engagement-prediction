body says city’s leader has to be someone central government trusts PUBLISHED : Wednesday, 22 February, 2017, 3:52pm UPDATED : Wednesday, 22 February, 2017, 4:09pm Sing Pao staff offered police protection after ‘gagging threat’ ahead of election 21 Feb 2017 \nElder statesman and vice-chairman of China’s top advisory body Tung Chee-hwa has warned that Beijing will not appoint the winner of the chief executive election to the city’s top post if it deems him or her unacceptable. \nSuch a situation would spark a a constitutional crisis in the city, fellow chief executive hopeful Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee said, urging Beijing to have greater faith in the judgment of the Election Committee members. \nThe Post understands that Tung, who was Hong Kong’s first chief executive, made the remarks on Friday during a closed-door meeting attended by more than 30 advisers of Our Hong Kong Foundation, a non-governmental think tank. \nIt remains unclear if Tung mentioned John Tsang Chun-wah’s name, though an adviser present at the meeting said he did mention the former financial secretary when talking about the importance of the central government’s trust in the city’s leader. \n“In response to some advisers’ questions regarding the chief executive election, Tung said John Tsang’s capability can’t compare with Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s, and the central government doesn’t trust him,” an adviser present at the time said. \nTung, vice-chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, is the foundation’s founding chairman. \nBut the adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tung did not elaborate on why Beijing did not trust the former financial secretary. \n“In order to avoid the embarrassment [of Tsang winning the contest], the central government is making an all-out effort to help Carrie Lam’s campaign,” the adviser added. \nTung’s warning came a few days after Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Wang Guangya told a number of Hong Kong politicians that the central government’s top echelon had made a collective decision to back Lam in the election. \nWang described Lam as the most capable contender for the top job, adding that the central government was optimistic about the prospects of her campaign. \nHe told the Hong Kong politicians that Beijing’s trust in the next chief executive was the most important criterion among the four he cited during his interview with the pro-Beijing Bauhinia magazine in December. \nTai Hay-lap, another adviser to the foundation, confirmed that Tung had discussed issues relating to the chief executive race at the Friday meeting. \n“Mr Tung responded to some advisers’ concern about the central government’s appointment of the winner in the election. But it’s inappropriate for me to reveal what Mr Tung said,” Tai added. \nA foundation spokeswoman said Tung had shared his thoughts on the latest situation in the international arena, China and Hong Kong. \n“Mr Tung talked about the uncertainties brought by elections in countries like France and the Netherlands. He made the point that under the Basic Law, the central government would not appoint someone it didn’t trust even if he or she won the chief executive election, and a chief executive who didn’t enjoy the trust of the central government would find his or job difficult,” she said. \nTung will meet another group of advisers on Wednesday afternoon. \nDuring a closed-door gathering with senior media executives last month, Carrie Lam warned that Hong Kong could face a constitutional crisis if Beijing deemed the winner of the contest unacceptable and refused to appoint him or her. \nLam, who lags behind arch-rival Tsang in opinion polls, admitted last month that there would be questions over her governance if she was picked by the 1,194-member Election Committee but trailed her rivals in terms of popularity. \n“What you have heard are just rumours. I think you will be hearing more sorts of things as we approach the end of the nomination stage,” Tsang said after attending a dialogue session with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service. \n“I do not want to comment on rumours, but the central people’s government does have the substantive power to appoint the chief executive as well as all principal officials ... there are always rumours in every election.” \nWhen asked if he had full confidence of being appointed should he win the race, Tsang said he would proceed “one step at a time” as he had yet to secure sufficient nominations. There would be by-election ... there would be repercussions, but I think Hong Kong should be strong enough to stand up to that. Regina Ip, chief executive contender \nRegina Ip said on Wednesday that if Beijing refused to appoint the election winner, it could trigger a constitutional crisis in Hong Kong, though she believed the matter would eventually be settled. \n“There would be by-election ... there would be repercussions, but I think Hong Kong should be strong enough to stand up to that,” she said. “Of course, I do not want this scenario to happen.” \nIp said Beijing should instead have more trust in the judgment of Election Committee members in picking the right leader for Hong Kong. \n“In the past two months, many Election Committee members have seen the performance of various candidates at various public forums,” Ip said. “I think the Election Committee members have a good idea of who would be the most effective and trustworthy chief executive for Hong Kong.” \nCivic Party lawmaker Dennis Kwok said it would be unacceptable for Beijing to refuse to appoint a duly-elected chief executive. \n“It would only anger Hongkongers even more. Even if Carrie Lam was elected like this, her mandate and authority would be greatly undermined, and she would be leading a lame-duck government on her first day in office,” Kwok said. \nCivic Party leader Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu said that party members were aware that according to some media outlets, certain political heavyweights had made statements that would have “the effect of interference in the Hong Kong chief executive election”. \n“This sort of statement is a clear violation or breach of Article 22 of the Basic Law, and we, the Civic Party, [want to] make it very clear that this is unacceptable. We ask these people to beware of what they say or what they do.” \nHe also said: “Under the Basic Law, the election committee members’ power to nominate and vote are substantial ... We recognise that the central government has the substantial power to appoint the chief executive, but anyone who tries to interfere with the election is obviously violating Article 22.” \n“If someone in the role of a state leader does not respect the article, he will effectively be taking the lead to violate the principle of ‘one country, two systems’,” Yeung added.
