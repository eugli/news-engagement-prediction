Aptly dubbed the honor V9, the Chinese company – a sub-brand of Huawei – packed some high-end hardware under the hood of the new device; the V9 also carries a rather competitive price tag. \nMuch like the Huawei Mate 9 series, the honor V9 is powered by Huawei’s very capable HiSilicon Kirin 960 processor, which is paired with up to 6GB of RAM. Other than than, the V9 also features a 5.7-inch 1440p LTPS display, 128GB of expandable storage, a generous 4,000mAh battery, as well as EMUI 5.0 based on Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. \nMuch like its predecessor, the honor V9 is equipped with a dual-camera system too: it’s made up of a 12MP monochrome sensor and a 12MP RGB one, which are aided by laser autofocus and an LED flash. Its secondary camera, on the other hand, is an 8MP shooter. \nNeedless to say, the honor V9 is a respectable flagship smartphone. Its large battery capacity is rather impressive too, especially considering the fact that the V9 is only 6.97mm thin. honor Magic Hands On: honor's Sleekest (and Smartest) Phone Yet \nThe honor V9 will go on sale in China on 28 February. The device is available in three variants: a 64GB model with 4GB of RAM for 2,599 Chinese yuan (about RM1,685), another 64GB variant with more RAM at 6GB for 2,999 yuan (approximately RM1,940), as well as the highest-end model with 128GB of storage and 6GB of RAM, which retails at 3,499 yuan (around RM2,265).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:08:05.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
