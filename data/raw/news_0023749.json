(ABC Radio Perth: Emma Wynne) \nHe said he was familiar with the misconceptions and prejudices in the non-Muslim community, but they were far from the reality. \n\"We teach maths, science, English — all the normal curriculum. We just have some periods for Islamic studies and Arabic as well,\" he said. \n\"We have about 40 per cent non-Muslim teachers on staff in the school. \n\"I don't care about background — we are all human beings and we need the best for the children. \n\"As long as you are qualified to teach the kids the subject, it's no problem.\" Hijab considered part of the uniform \nAssistant principal Yahya Ibrahim agreed there was little about the school that would be unfamiliar to an outsider. \nThe school has a playing field, playground, gym and parent-run canteen. \nThe school uniform is also only slightly different — the girls wear long-sleeved shirts and longer skirts, and most of them wear the hijab .

(ABC Radio Perth: Emma Wynne) \n\"We don't have a school requirement for head covering per se, but it is encouraged after year four,\" Sheik Ibrahim said. \n\"We do have some students who won't put it on, even into high school, and we are tolerant of that — but we consider it a school uniform rather than really about the religion.\" A multicultural school community \nAssistant principal Naeem Meer has worked at the school for six years, after stints teaching in the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates and Brunei. \nLIC is the first Islamic school he has worked at. He described the experience as \"quite exhilarating — more so because of the cohort of students that we have\". Photo: Kindergarten students get their first taste of life in a classroom. (ABC Radio Perth: Emma Wynne) \n\"It's very multicultural. We have students from various backgrounds, including really problematic war-torn areas,\" he said. \nHe said outsider preconceptions of what goes on inside an Islamic school were vastly different from the reality. \n\"Given what is happening in the media at the moment there is a lot of stigma attached to Muslims and Islam,\" Mr Meer said. \n\"I think the first misconception is that Islamic schools have only Muslim teachers. \n\"Whilst we push for an Islamic ethos, it's is by no means that we are not tolerant to other religions. \n\"When I came to Australia whenever I applied to a Catholic school, the first thing they asked was — do you follow that religion? That precluded my CV from being taken any further. \n\"I think we are much more tolerant.\" Welcoming, cooperative students \nMaths and science teacher Bhawan Marwaha does not follow Islam; she is Hindu. \nMs Marwaha began working at the school straight after graduation. \nShe said she and her daughter, who was enrolled at the school for a period of time, have always been welcomed. \n\"It's not orthodox. It's a beautiful environment to work and being non-Muslim, it's not hard for me,\" she said. Photo: Langford Islamic College students take part in a sports lesson at the gym. (ABC Radio Perth: Emma Wynne) \nAnother non-Muslim staff member is English literature teacher Rosemary Nelson. \nShe came to the school a year ago after working at a number of other public and independent schools. \n\"They had dropped literature at the other school that I was at, so when I got the chance to it again, because that is my major, I was just really happy,\" Ms Nelson said. \nShe said the curriculum she teaches at LIC is exactly the same as at any other school. \n\"I don't do anything any different — except I can do it a lot better here because the children are so cooperative and parents make sure they have got materials,\" she said. \n\"We have a terrific parent body; they are mostly professional people and they want the very best for their kids, but they are also so appreciative of what teachers do.\" Photo: Encouraging words cover the door of the year five classroom at Langford Islamic College. (ABC Radio Perth: Emma Wynne) \nShe said her heart sinks whenever she sees media reports about Muslims and terrorism. \n\"I see something happen and I think: 'Oh my God, these guys are going to have to put up with all the flak from that,'\" she said. \n\"The girls do get a bit [of harassment] and because I teach social sciences as well ... those discussions will come up. \n\"I try and encourage the kids to be outgoing, to let people know that they are just like everyone else, they are just wearing a different style of fashion.\" Islamophobia 'frustrating, hurtful' \nABC Radio Perth spoke to a group of year 11 female students who said they had all experienced some form of Islamophobia when out in public.

(ABC Radio Perth: Emma Wynne) \n\"It happened to me and my mum once,\" Jamila recalled. \n\"We were grocery shopping and some guy was swearing at us and stuff. My mum just called him a coward. \n\"It does get frustrating at first but after a while you get used to it. \n\"Everyone has different opinions and you realise that not everyone can see things the way you see them.\" \nStudent Amaliya started wearing the hijab when she was 12.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:59:31.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
