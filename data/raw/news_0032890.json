America as it stands in early 2017 probably could use the kind of excitement accorded and generated by the Grammys at any number of protests currently popping up around the nation over matters much more grave than, say, how much Drake and Rihanna were robbed when Twenty One Pilots’ “Stressed Out” took Best Pop Vocal Duo or Group Performance over “Work.”\nWho needs serious political discourse, though, when you’ve got a lavish and self-consciously serious TV spectacle whose producer, Ken Ehrlich, promised to NBC News going in last night would contain at least one “politically charged moment”? One, eh? So much for popular music as the voice of the counterculture.\nNot that the Grammys have ever been the voice of the counterculture, of course. If that was the case, David Bowie wouldn’t have had to die in January of 2016 to win five Grammys in a single evening, as he did on the heels of last year’s spectacular epitaph, Blackstar — two apiece for the album and its title track, one for art director Jonathan Barnbrook’s striking album packaging — on Sunday; he would have won a bunch in the 1960s and 1970s and certainly more up until now than his Best Video/Short Form award for Jazzin’ For Blue Jean in 1985 and a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006.\n No, the Grammys used to come around once a year to give an industry-ordained boost in sales to the biggest records of the previous 12 months and, perhaps, nudge a couple of interesting outliers with a hint of bankable potential — or a couple of pop “near misses” yet to recoup considerable label investments on their parts — toward the mainstream. And that was fine: it gave them a vague sense of purpose.\nNowadays, however, when the idea of buying records has grown increasingly obsolete for much of the population, what purpose do the Grammys serve other than to draw attention to themselves, other than to generate sufficient morning-after talking points, instances of low-level “controversy” and TV ratings to justify a return to the TV screen next year?\nIn 2017, the Grammys generally rely on a parade of red-carpet finery, the increasingly stale hook known as the “Grammy moment” — unfailingly awkward onstage matchups of artists who tend to have as little business performing onstage together (see: Metallica and Lady Gaga) as common sense might dictate when looking at the names together on the program — and the thin promise that someone might go off a very tight script and say or do something outrageous.\nAt press time, the most outrageous thing that had happened on the Grammy broadcast, sadly, was the members of Twenty One Pilots pulling down their pants whilst accepting the aforementioned award.\nEven Paris Jackson undercut her own “political” comment, maybe intentionally and maybe not, by adding: “Everyone looks so beautiful, especially Beyoncé.”\nAnd did Beyoncé, nominated nine times for Lemonade , last year’s pointed multimedia treatise on Afro-American female identity, make a big statement of her own on Sunday? Maybe, but a pretentious, self-worshipping set piece that seemed to suggest variously that she was the first pop-star ever to have babies, or that the looming birth of her twins is the result of some sort of divine design, managed to eclipse any message that might have been intended about feminine empowerment in the era of the “Grab her by the pussy” president.\nKaty Perry, too, aimed for a vaguely timely statement about current affairs performing her new single, “Chained to the Rhythm,” with Skip Marley while wearing a “resist” armband and a projection of the U.S. Constitution behind her.\nMost of last night’s live music was remarkably ho-hum: Adele opening the broadcast with the unsurprising choice of “Hello”; Toronto’s the Weeknd and a Vader-masked Daft Punk blunting all the edges they might once have had with a safe reading of “I Feel It Coming”; and Ed Sheeran doing the bland Ed Sheeran thing that Ed Sheeran does to continued, mystifying popularity.\nFingers were crossed early on that at least the planned tribute to the Bee Gees by Demi Lovato, Tori Kelly and Andra Day or an onstage meeting of Anderson .Paak and A Tribe Called Quest might produce some mild excitement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:03:38.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
