Stamos hopes that his message of love and acceptance helps lower these staggering numbers, giving more shelter animals the chance to live out their lives in caring and compassionate homes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:06:47.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
