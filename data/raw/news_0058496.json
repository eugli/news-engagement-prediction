deportations of immigrants here illegally 1 / 46 Back to Gallery The Department of Homeland Security released new guidelines on its immigration policy Tuesday, in essence putting any immigrant here illegally at risk of deportation in what is a major shift in government strategy.\nThe Obama administration, which deported a record number of more than 2 million immigrants, had focused the government's limited resources on removing immigrants in the country illegally who had been convicted of serious crimes or those who had recently arrived.\nUnder the new memorandums , immigration agents are instructed to deport anyone convicted of a criminal offense, including those driving without a license, a common predicament for many of the more than half a million immigrants here illegally in Harris County who are unable to secure such a document because of their immigration status.\nBORDER LIFE: There's a border wall already, here's what life looks like there\nParents who seek to send their children here illegally could also be prosecuted for smuggling if they are identified by federal agents.\nArm in arm and holding flowers, thousands of Mexicans formed a \"human wall\" on the border with the United States this Friday, in protest against President Donald Trump's plan to build a major barrier there to prevent the passage of undocumented immigrants. Video provided by AFP\nMedia: MediaOS Video \"DHS shall ensure the proper enforcement of our immigration laws against those who — directly or indirectly — facilitate the smuggling or trafficking of alien children into the United States,\" the agency said in a release. \"This includes placing parents or guardians who are removable aliens into removal proceedings, or referring such individuals for criminal prosecution.\"\nThe policy also calls for an expansion of a process known as expedited removal, which allows agents to deport more people immediately. Previously it was only used within 100 miles of the border for immigrants who had been in the country no more than 14 days. Now it will include those who have been in the country for up to two years and who are detained anywhere in the nation.\nWALL IMPACT: Texas could be hurt most by new border wall\nThe shift requires a dramatic boost of resources, and in the documents Tuesday the agencies are required to hire 10,000 new immigration agents, 5,000 Border Patrol agents, and increase the number of federal detention facilities.\nIt also would expand the use of a controversial program known as 287 (g,) which allows local law enforcement to help enforce federal immigration law. The program has been accused of leading to racial profiling and under the Obama administration was greatly scaled back.\nGalveston County commissioners voted to institute the program last week. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez has said he would dismantle the program.\nSee what life looks like on both sides of the current U.S.-Mexico border wall in the gallery above.", "external_links":
