Greenpeace say radiation levels are on a par with Chernobyl, which has an exclusion zone more than 30 years on (Photo: REUTERS) \nEnergy campaigner Ai Kashiwagi said: \"The relatively high radiation values, both inside and outside houses, show an unacceptable radiation risk for citizens if they were to return to Iitate. \n\"For citizens returning to their irradiated homes, they are at risk of receiving radiation equivalent to one chest X-ray every week. \n\"This is not normal or acceptable.\" Read More Nuclear radiation has been spreading across Europe - and nobody knows where it's coming from \nGreenpeace Japan’s survey found levels of radiation well above government targets. \nTheir team took measurements of houses around the area, which was used to calculate an average annual exposure rate. \nSoil samples were also taken as well as retrieving personal dose badges that were installed in two houses in February 2016. Local officials gathering data after the Fukushima disaster (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nThe average radiation exposure in Iitate was found to be between 39 millisieverts (mSv) and 183mSv over the course of 70 years (excluding natural radiation), which exceeds yearly guidelines set by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). \nThe ICRP says a maximum recommended annual radiation exposure is 1mSv. \nGreenpeace say the Japanese government has not completed risk assessments for lifetime exposure to the radiation.
