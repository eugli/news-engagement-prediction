Justin Gover, GW Pharma's chief \nJ ustin Gover, GW's chief executive, said the data from the trial would speed up GW's oncology research in the coming months and lead to further clinical development programmes in other forms of cancer. \n\"The signals of efficacy demonstrated in this study further reinforce the potential role of cannabinoids in the field of oncology and provide GW with the prospect of a new and distinct cannabinoid product candidate in the treatment of glioma,” he said. \nGW is nearing regulatory approval for a potentially game-changing cannabis-based drug to treat children with severe epilepsy. It plans to file the drug, called Epidiolex, with US regulators in the first half of 2017 and with European authorities in the second half of the year. \nThe UK-headquartered company is widely considered one of the country's most promising biotechs. In December last year de-listed from the Aim market in favour of trading its shares exclusively on Nasdaq in the United States.
