Of course, the FAA is already modernizing. Feb10,201712:40PMEST \nAfter President Trump's meeting Thursday with airline industry leaders, many in the industry seemed pleased. \nAfter all, one concept that unites the industry is that the nation's air traffic control system needs to be modernized. And a conclusion that emerged from Thursday's meeting is that Trump also supports ATC modernization. \n\"I hear we're spending billions and billions of dollars, and it's a system that's totally out of whack,\" were Trump's words on the subject. \nThe president sat directly across from Southwest ( LUV ) CEO Gary Kelly, who \"steered the conversation from the get-go to the country's aging air traffic control system,\" according to The Dallas Morning News . \nTrump also suggested that the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees ATC, runway modernization funding, and, critically, aviation safety, should be run by a pilot. The president's observation was, \"I just think a non-pilot wouldn't know the sophistication of the system.\" \nPilots are characterized by an ability to take command of an aircraft. The FAA is a different sort of operation, widely diffused, extremely successful in its oversight of aviation safety, somewhat successful in seeking to modernize ATC even as the system continues to operate, and always troubled because each of the 535 members of Congress and the Senate wants to take command. \nThat might make for a difficult flight operation. \nIn any case, here are the top five reactions to Thursday's meeting. American's Doug Parker: Sorry I Couldn't Make It \nIn a message to employees on Thursday night, American ( AAL ) CEO Doug Parker explained, for the second time in 24 hours, why he could not attend the session. \n\"Unfortunately, in our divided political climate, some assume my not being there was a political statement,\" Parker said. \"Nothing could be further from the truth. I would have happily attended the meeting and would like to have been able to do so.\" \nBut it was scheduled for the same time as Parker was speaking to 1,600 American managers at the airline's annual leadership conference. \nParker said he was told the meeting went well and that Trump was receptive to the industry's desire for \"ATC reform, lower taxes and less regulation.\" \nDan Carey, president of the Allied Pilots Association, said Parker should have gone. \n\"Yesterday, the most important meeting to our pilots and the employees of American Airlines was in Washington D.C. with the president of the United States,\" Carey said in a prepared statement. \"But no matter the meeting choice of our CEO, we remain confident and hopeful that President Trump will continue to deliver on his promise to put U.S. jobs first again.\" \nAmerican's CEO Doug Parker Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:58:40.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
