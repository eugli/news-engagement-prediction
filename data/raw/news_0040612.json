With many key rivals doing longer runs in the 1:29 bracket, the 2010, 2012 and 2015 MotoGP™ World Champion’s aim is just that on Day 3 – getting faster and more consistent as he gets to grips with the very different Desmosedici. \nThe Mallorcan did 64 laps in the second session with a best of 1:30.197, getting closer to his trademark blistering consistency. \nJL99, P15: “Today we’ve done a lot of work, looking for how to be quicker and more consistent. We’ve made some small steps, we’ve managed to do a lot of laps in th 1:30 bracket and we’re getting close to the 1:29s. We’ll see if tomorrow we’re able to have a faster rhythm and get into the 1:29s consistently. We’ve continued trying different settings, new solutions and although we’re quite far off, we have to be positive. Tonight we’ll study the data to keep working and get closer to the front tomorrow.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:55:31.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
