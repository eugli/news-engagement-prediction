(Getty Images) More After sweeping front-office changes to hire Magic Johnson as president of basketball operations for the Los Angeles Lakers , the franchise is strongly considering agent Rob Pelinka to become general manager, league sources told The Vertical.\nPelinka has been one of the NBA’s top player agents and has strong ties to the franchise through his relationship with longtime client Kobe Bryant and owner Jeanie Buss. Pelinka is at the top of a short list of candidates to become the top day-to-day executive, sources said.\nBefore the Lakers fired Mitch Kupchak and Jim Buss on Tuesday, the franchise had already moved away from trying to pursue the Golden State Warriors’ Bob Myers, the franchise’s original top target for general manager, league sources told The Vertical.\nAfter Myers signed a recent contract extension, it became clear to Lakers brass that it would be unable to lure Myers, league sources said.\nWithin the Lakers’ new top circle of power, another sitting general manager who has been a significant source of intrigue for the freshly vacant L.A. general manager job: Portland’s Neil Olshey, league sources said. Olshey is a two-time runner-up for NBA Executive of the Year, including 2016 with the Blazers and 2011 as Clippers general manager after beating out the Lakers to acquire Chris Paul.\nIn the cases of Myers and Olshey, it is extremely difficult to hire a general manager who’s under contract elsewhere. Rival owners generally aren’t interested in letting top-level executives leave for competitors, especially the Lakers.\nLakers assistant general manager Ryan West has a strong relationship and history with Pelinka, and would likely be considered a significant part of a new front-office regime, league sources said.\nFor the Lakers to hire Pelinka – which would follow the Warriors’ blueprint on ex-agent Myers – there would need to be a process of him divesting from his Landmark Sports representation business. Pelinka’s client list includes Houston Rockets All-Star guard James Harden, Houston’s Eric Gordon and Golden State’s Andre Iguodala.\nKupchak’s inability to complete a deal with Sacramento for All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins over the weekend played a part in the timing of the purge, league sources said. The Kings chose a New Orleans offer over the Lakers’ on Sunday night.\nPopular video from The Vertical:", "external_links": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/pnr-wp/2017/02/21144531/GettyImages-643004326.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/noLNUh0bb4DIPG8gZ1ZUCA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NjQ5/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/be2f2fa1b598f4cf200d02e9e62ad60d"], "published": "2017-02-22T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:05:59.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
