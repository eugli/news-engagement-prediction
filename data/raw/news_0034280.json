The man was arrested on suspicion of assault.

The man was then taken to the James Paget hospital. \n‘As is standard procedure in cases of this nature, the incident has been referred to the IPCC. A full investigation into what happened is underway’ \nAn IPCC spokesman said: ‘The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has launched an independent investigation after a man died following an arrest carried out by officers with Suffolk Constabulary. \n‘Paul Gladwell, 38, from Colchester was initially detained by staff at Pontins Holiday Park, London Road, Kessingland, Lowestoft at about 11.40pm, 14 February and subsequently arrested on suspicion of assault. \n‘While being transported to Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre in a police van officers became concerned for his wellbeing, stopped the van, and contacted an ambulance. \n‘The man was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital by ambulance in a critical condition. Sadly earlier today, 16 February, Mr Gladwell was pronounced dead. \n‘The incident was referred to the IPCC, an independent investigation has been launched, and a team has attended the scene and post incident procedure. His family has been informed. \n‘Investigators are carrying out house-to-house enquiries, speaking to witnesses and gathering CCTV footage.’ \nIPCC Commissioner Cindy Butts said: ‘Our thoughts are with the man’s relatives and friends at this difficult time. Our investigators will be conducting a thorough enquiry into all the circumstances surrounding his interaction with the police.’ \nAnyone who witnessed the incident is asked to contact the IPCC by email at witness@ipcc.gsi.gov.uk or by telephone on 0800 096 9070.
