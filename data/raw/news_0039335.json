In a hospital. It’s all documented,” he said. \nWhen he renewed his passport this year, though, it arrived with a letter. \n“Please return your invalid permanent resident card,” it read. “Your timely submission of these documents will provide USCIS with the information necessary to update its systems to reflect your current citizenship status.” \nAiritam first had to figure out what a permanent resident card was. \n“Once I did, I was not only surprised but very concerned,” he said. \nMore commonly known as a “green card,” it’s not a document Airitam has ever had or ever needed. \n“Because I was born here in the United States,” he explained. \nBoth his original and newly issued passport list his birthplace as New York. \nSo, he called the number provided in the letter. \n“They were confused in terms of how that happened, but they didn’t have any answers for me,” he said. \nAiritam said he was told to visit his nearest U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office. \nThe next available appointment he discovered, is in March. \nEven then, a department spokesperson told CBS11 there’s nothing it can do. \nSince Airitam never immigrated to this country, the office wouldn’t have any record of him. \n“I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and that’s why I went ahead and made that appointment,” he said. \nIncreased scrutiny of international travelers has him nervous. \n“I think it should raise concerns with anyone who has a discrepancy with their passport,” he said. \nHe was hoping to celebrate his 50th wedding anniversary with a trip abroad this summer. \nNow he’s having second thoughts. \n“I would not leave the country without this being resolved,” he said. \n  Andrea Lucia facebook Follow Andrea joined CBS 11 and TXA 21 in September 2010, one day before a tornado swept through the area.
