Alamy 2 Men with a larger waistline are more likely to last longer between the sheets, doctors discovered \nPremature ejaculation is the most frequently reported sexual problem among men, according to the Erciyes University in Turkey study. \nIt is defined as ejaculating before, or within a minute of vaginal penetration and the inability to delay the climax. \nFor many men who suffer this affliction, it can cause distress and eventually lead to them avoiding sexual intimacy. \nBut, doctors have discovered that men who reported suffering from premature ejaculation actually had a leaner BMI than those who didn’t. \nThe UK is facing an obesity epidemic, with heart disease the biggest killer in the country causing about 74,000 deaths each year. \nThat’s the equivalent of 200 people dying everyday from the obesity related disease. \nOther side effects of being overweight include high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and an increased risk of stroke. Getty Images Men who are leaner were more likely to suffer premature ejaculation \nThe message from doctors nation-wide is that something needs to change. \nAnd while obesity is associated with erectile dysfunction , it is not associated with premature ejaculation (PE). \nIn the study , more than 200 men were asked how long it took them to ejaculate. \nThey were then placed into two groups – a premature ejaculation group and a control group. \nResearchers found the number of obese men in the control group, those who lasted longer in the bedroom, was three times higher that the group prone to premature ejaculation. \nFurthermore, the number of men in the premature ejaculation group who were a normal weight but climaxed within a minute was two times higher.
