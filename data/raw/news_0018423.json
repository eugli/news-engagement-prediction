(Photo: Jerome Miron, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nDave Pericak, the global director of Ford Performance, said Monday that Danica Patrick’s No. 10 Ford will remain on the race track this season “one way or another” despite major sponsorship shortfalls. \nStewart-Haas Racing, which switched to Ford from Chevrolet beginning this season, filed a breach of contract lawsuit in North Carolina superior court last week seeking to recover more than $31 million from Nature’s Bakery in unfulfilled obligations and damages stemming from its commitment as Patrick’s primary sponsor. Nature’s Bakery informed the team Jan. 19 it intended to terminate the deal. \nSHR as an organization has multiple sponsor shortfalls, with new teammate Clint Bowyer also without a benefactor for numerous upcoming races in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season, which begins with the Feb. 26 Daytona 500. Bowyer is replacing team co-owner Tony Stewart, who retired from NASCAR’s premier series after last season. The organization said in a statement the lawsuit will not affect its “on-track efforts.” \nAdding four-car SHR, which includes former series champions Kevin Harvick and Kurt Busch, gives Ford more cars on the track and therefore more chances for victory, but also a broader swath of information to advance the company’s efforts against Chevrolet and Toyota. The last time Ford won a Cup championship was in 2004, with Busch at then-Roush Racing. \nRELATED COVERAGE: Kevin Harvick anxious to get on the racetrack after switch to Ford \nManufacturers generally allow teams to handle sponsor business, but Pericak — while not committing company resources to the venture — expressed confidence during a national teleconference that Patrick’s season would not be compromised. \n“What I can say is you have my commitment and the commitment of Stewart-Haas Racing and everyone that’s involved, that it is not going to affect our ability to hit the track and run that car and run it the way it needs to be run,” he said. \n“I don’t really want to make any additional comments given where we are in the whole situation and it’s very unfortunate that we are going through it right now, but one way or another I can just tell that you will have that 10 car on the track and it will be ready to perform.” \nNature’s Bakery sponsored 27 Cup races for Patrick last season and was to back from 20 to 25 this season, the second in a three-year deal. \nThe Nevada-based company has not responded to requests for comment from USA TODAY Sports. \nAspen Dental has committed to four races this season, TaxAct and Code 3 Associates three each for the No. 10. \nPatrick is entering her fifth full-time season. She has six top-10s and a Daytona 500 pole in 154 Cup starts. \nFollow James on Twitter @brantjames \nPHOTOS: Danica Patrick's NASCAR career Facebook Posted!
