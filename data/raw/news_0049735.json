Photo: NSW Police \nOn that night, the 29-year-old man told police he was walking Egg near the corner of Australia Avenue and Parkview Drive about 10.30pm when he was confronted by three men who were armed with knives. \nThe man told police the offenders demanded his wallet and backpack, which he handed over to them.

Two of the men were said to be of slim build and the third man was of a large build with a bald head and a goatee, he claimed.

He is due to appear in Burwood Local Court on April 6. \nA NSW Police spokesman said on Wednesday it was not clear why the man allegedly made up the story. It was not known whether he was the co-owner of the puppy. \n\"The main thing is, we really don't know what has happened to Egg or where Egg is,\" he said. \n\"Anyone with information of the dog's whereabouts is urged to contact police.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:11:58.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
