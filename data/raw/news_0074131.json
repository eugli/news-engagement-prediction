Brazil’s superstars will face players from Bournemouth, Genk, Hangzhou Greentown, Burton Albion and Baniyas. \nThe comparison is chalk and cheese, as the current reality for the Socceroos and Australian football means players aren’t able to crack it in big clubs in the biggest leagues. \nDespite the relative success on the international stage, winning the Asian Cup in 2015 and building an identifiable style of play, our best players haven’t made the next step in their club careers. \nThose gaps in the squad now again come to the forefront ahead of three crucial World Cup qualifiers and the friendly against Brazil, which leads immediately into the Confederations Cup. Philippe Coutinho, Neymar and Gabriel Jesus could all be in Australia to face Argentina and the Socceroos.

Mathew Leckie is one of a few Socceroos in a top league, but has struggled for goals.

That is one stumbling block out of the way for event organisers – who can also look towards big names such as Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino, Willian, David Luiz and, Champions League commitments permitting, Marcelo and Dani Alves. \nThere is also the contingent of big name stars who have moved to the Chinese Super League, including Hulk, Alex Teixeira, Oscar and Ramires. \nAfter the disaster of falling at the group stage of the Copa America last year, Brazil have now won seven games on the bounce, conceding just once.
