He said the suspects were “trained” and had even practised the attack at different public places, including a major mall in downtown Kuala Lumpur. \n“Yes, the two female suspects knew that the substance they had was toxic,\" he said. \"We don’t know what kind of chemical was used. They used their bare hands.”\nHe added that they were instructed to wash their hands afterwards.\nRead more Why dark tourism is more important than ever in grim political times North Korea’s ambassador to Malaysia has meanwhile insisted that the man who died in the airport is not Kim Jong-un's brother and that Malaysia’s investigation into the death cannot be trusted. \nMr Kim, who was estranged from his younger brother and lived with his wife and two children in Macau on the south coast of China, had previously spoken out against his family’s dynastic control of North Korea. \nHe is also said to have been “paranoid” before his death, fearing that his brother would order his assassination, or that someone would try to kill him in a bid to impress the North Korean leader.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:03:17.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
