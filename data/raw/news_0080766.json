Photo: Aria Isadora/BFA.com/Aria Isadora/BFA.com Hello phones, Gossip Girl alert: Penn Badgley, who played Dan on the CW’s Upper East Side teen drama, just married Domino Kirke, who plays a doula in real life. According to E! News , Badgley took Kirke to a Brooklyn courthouse this afternoon. Kirke’s sisters, the actresses Jemima and Lola, attended the ceremony in varied interpretations of wedding attire.\nWhen someone gets married in a courthouse, it's really an open invitation to everyone but the beautiful bride to explore all that fashion has to offer. Here, I try a look simply called \"Pants,\" as Cassius goes for \"That Dude from #incubus\" and Jemima experiments with \"Off to Therapy!\" Congratulations @dominokirke. We love you. \nA post shared by Lola Kirke (@lolakirke) on Feb 27, 2017 at 8:37am PST \nBadgley and Kirke have been dating for a good while — I saw them walking along Berry Street in Williamsburg two years ago. (Badgley had his hair in braids.) In recent years, Badgley has played in a band called Mothxr, and Kirke has been featured in the New York Times for her doula work.\nCongrats to a couple beautiful people ❤ \nA post shared by Darren Will (@smileoutofhell) on Feb 27, 2017 at 11:06am PST \nIt is crazy that these two people found each other, and that Dan was Gossip Girl.\nTags: fame gossip girl penn badgley domino kirke jemima kirke marriage More Gossip Girl ’s Penn Badgley Surprise Married a Doula    \nDomino \n \nThe Kit \n'Keeping Up With The Kardashians' is Getting Cancelled\n  6 mins ago Having Kids Affects How Much Women Sleep, But Not Men Sorry, Mom.\n5:22 p.m. Donald  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:08:39.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
