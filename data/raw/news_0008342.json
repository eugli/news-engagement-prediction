It's disgusting,\" she said. \nWhen Wynn returned home she was shocked to discover the travellers had left not just their rubbish in her wheelie bin, but toilet paper covered in faecal matter. \n\"It felt like a home invasion. I used rubber gloves and burnt the toilet paper.\" \nShe was unsure exactly what they had left in her garden but was reluctant to do any gardening in case she made an unwelcome discovery. \n\"They have invaded my privacy. I want people to know this is not ok,\" she said. \nFortunately her neighbour managed to write down the perpetrators' car registration number and will pass it on to police. \nGeraldine ward councillor Kerry Stevens said it was totally unacceptable and unhygienic behaviour. He was not aware of such an incident occurring before and he hoped it never happened again. \n\"I feel sorry for the woman (Wynn).\" \nThere was no lack of public toilets in Geraldine, with the town voted one of the top 10 places for a \"pit stop\" in New Zealand, according to a recent AA Traveller survey, Stevens said. \nA new $181,000 public toilet block next to the existing women's public toilets on Cox St is expected to be up and running by April. \nGeraldine Community Board member Janene​ Adams said she was one of a few committee members in the process of designing the photofilm exterior for the new toilet block. \n\"We thought we may have a local forest scene with information boxes scattered throughout. We are lucky to have Peel and Talbot forests so close by.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T12:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T07:44:41.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
