Photo by Christian Gooden, Christian Gooden \nJoel Currier, who has been a reporter at the Post-Dispatch since 2005, has won the United Media Guild’s 2016 Terry Hughes Award for writing. \nCurrier was awarded the honor Thursday night at a Guild awards ceremony downtown. The guild represents media workers, and the contest is open to writers for any St. Louis publication. Currier was chosen by a panel of past winners. \nHughes was a Post-Dispatch columnist who died of breast cancer in 1991 at age 36. Her columns included the perspectives of everyday people and their struggles, promoting understanding in the community. \nFor the first part of last year, Currier covered breaking news. In May, he switched to covering the state circuit courts in St. Louis and St. Louis County. Despite the demand of covering the daily cases in these two busy courts, Currier was able to look outside the courthouse and provide close-up views to stories behind the scenes. \nHe wrote about Jadda Kennedy , a young mother who was mistaken for someone else and held without bail for one year on a murder charge before charges were abruptly dropped; George Allen , a mentally ill man who died a few years after spending three decades in prison for a murder conviction that was ultimately overturned; and a south St. Louis County man suspected of accidentally killing his 84-year-old neighbor, Betty Knight , as she sat on her back porch with her husband of more than six decades. \nCurrier, 39, has also worked the night shift as a crime reporter and covered crime and courts in St. Charles County. He has a master’s degree in journalism from the University of Missouri, where he wrote for the Columbia Missourian. He was a summer intern in 2004 at the Post-Dispatch, and he served as the editor for two weekly papers covering the eastern suburbs of Syracuse, N.Y. \nAside from work, Currier has been a member of the Ambassadors of Harmony , a 130-man chorus, since 2005; and Vocal Edge , an eight-man a cappella group, since 2009. He and his wife have one daughter, who just celebrated her first birthday. \nJoel Currier, a St. Louis Post-Dispatch breaking news reporter, is photographed in the P-D studio on Wednesday, Sept. 2, 2015.
