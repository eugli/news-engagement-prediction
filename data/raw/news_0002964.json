Bellator announced on Tuesday that former UFC title challenger Koscheck has been scheduled to face Mauricio Alonso in a welterweight bout on the main card of Bellator 172 . This event is set to take place at the SAP Center in San Jose, Calif. on Feb. 18, and is currently headlined by heavyweights Fedor Emelianenko and Matt Mitrione . Koscheck, who fought most of his entire career under the UFC banner, made his move over to Bellator in June 2015. Since then, the 39-year-old fighter has been scheduled to make his promotional debut twice, once at Bellator 148 and the other at Bellator 158 , but has been forced to pull out of the fights due to injury. Koscheck last fought at UFC Fight Night 62 back in 2015 where he suffered a submission loss to Erick Silva . His opponent, Alonso is riding a two-fight winning streak. The 36-year-old Brazilian has a professional record of 12-7 and one no contest, and last competed in August. Alonso has fought once for the promotion, losing a decesion to Nick Pica at Bellator 142 . Additionally, the promotion also announced a middleweight bout between Anatoly Tokov and Francisco France , and the cancellation of a previously announced main card bout between Adam Piccolotti and Brent Primus . Piccolotti was forced to withdraw due to an undisclosed injury.
