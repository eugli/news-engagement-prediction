Usually, but not always. \nBritain’s decision to leave the EU also threatens the free movement of horses, potentially dealing a blow to the racing community in the UK and Ireland, industry experts and an MEP have said. Brexiters face rude awakening on immigration, says ex-minister Read more \nA tripartite agreement between the UK, France and the Republic of Ireland allows thoroughbred horses to travel freely between those countries for races. Under an EU directive, the horses need only to have an EU passport and be on a livestock database. They do not require a veterinary export health certification or customs documentation. \nSuch are the concerns about the future of the arrangement that “Brexit’s potential impact on the horse industry” will be the lead subject for discussion at the National Equine Forum in London in March. \nThe UK has signalled its intention to leave both the single market and the customs union, although Theresa May has expressed a desire for “frictionless borders”. \nLucy Greayer, a shipping agent, said the racing industry was in the dark over the future. “The current agreement between Ireland, the UK and France means that horses can move around freely without health documentation or anything like that. But if you go further afield, to Germany or Italy, you have to have a certificate from a vet saying they have seen the animal in the last 48 hours and it is fit to travel. \n“We don’t know what is going to happen. I have horses going to St Moritz in Switzerland. We are having to get a carnet [a document to clear customs]. And that costs a lot of money, hundreds of pounds. It’s perfectly possible that there could be more restrictions going to France. We have more horses going to France than horses coming the other way,” she said. \n“We just don’t know what is going to happen when Brexit comes into effect. Maybe every time John Godson or Sir Michael Stoute want to send a horse to France they have to get them a carnet. It costs money and it takes time because you have to go to the chamber of commerce to get it.” Brexit white paper spells out need for new immigration laws Read more \nMairead McGuinness, an MEP for the Midlands–North-West constituency in Ireland, said she was concerned about the potential blow to the industry, which is worth €1.3bn a year to the Republic. “Uncertainty about so many issues around Brexit extends to the movement of live animals – domestic pets, farm animals and of course, horses. The EU facilitates the movement of horses between member states,” she said. \n“What will happen when the UK leaves the EU is totally uncertain. How the important business between Ireland and the UK will be impacted is unknown, but there will be consequences and thoroughbred breeders are aware of the threat. \n“This is adding to uncertainty in the sector as it tries to navigate the unknown. Border controls, disease controls etc are possible outcomes, disrupting the normal movement of horses for racing and breeding between Ireland and the UK. Currency fluctuations are an immediate risk but the real concern is that the situation as it operates today will remain in place – but can it?” \nMcGuinness added: “If Brexit means borders – what then? And if the UK moves away from the EU regulatory regime on diseases controls, animal welfare and animal transport, this too could have negative consequences. I am not sure if anyone is betting on the outcome.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T18:34:47.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
