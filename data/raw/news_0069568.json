PA 7 Kayleigh was horrified by this picture of her struggling to walk up a hill \nDisgusted with the picture, she swapped calorific ready meals for wholesome shakes – shedding three stone in the three months before her wedding. \nKayleigh recalled: “When I looked at the photo I felt sick. \n“It was January 2015 and I looked like the Honey Monster, and thought, ‘Poor Liam is looking at that!’ \n“I’d been for a walk with Liam and my brother – who’d bounded up the hill, while I’d struggled to walk up it. PA Real Life/Sophotogenic Wedding Photography 7 Bride-to-be who looked like the Honey Monster slims to win beauty pageant \n“After seeing the photo, I felt so awful, I couldn’t wait to get home. When I weighed myself and saw I was 17.5 stone, I thought, ‘Are you joking?’ \nStunning nurse, Kayleigh, 25, was disgusted by snap of her 17.5st bulky frame and after vowing to lose weight, shed five stone. \n“I was too embarrassed to tell Liam what I weighed, but knew I wanted to get the pounds off asap. He downloaded an app and cooked me healthy meals. He was really supportive.” \nKayleigh dropped three stone, and was 14st 7lbs when she tied the knot with green keeper Liam Atkinson on 11 April 2015 in the Tees Valley and says she felt a million dollars in her ivory lace princess gown and was showered with compliments. \nJetting off on their honeymoon for ten days to Jamaica, the couple from Newton Aycliffe, in County Durham soaked up the Caribbean sunshine – also sipping cocktails and tucking into the local food. \nBut when Kayleigh saw a poolside snap taken on Liam’s phone, of her wearing an orange smock, horrified by her bulges, she vowed to take drastic action. PA 7 Honeymoon indulgence made her put on weight again \nShe said: “I put on weight on our honeymoon. I was eating normal dinners and snacks, chicken, rice, pasta. \n“We had American style breakfasts, donuts and pancakes. It wasn’t good for my waistline.” \nAt the end of the honeymoon she had piled the pounds back on and weighed almost 17 stone again. \nKayleigh admitted she always enjoyed tucking in to her mum Lynda Coulthard’s, home-cooked meals, and weighed around 12 stone when she was 16. \nBut, at 5ft 8in, she carried her weight well and Liam never commented on her size – happily tucking into pizzas in front of the TV and restaurant meals with her. PA Real Life 7 Bride-to-be who looked like the Honey Monster slims to win beauty pageant \nHer job as a children’s nurse didn’t help her waistline either, as she worked long shifts, relying on canteen food, like jacket potatoes and crisps – also gobbling down chocolates, given to her as thank you presents by patients and their families. \nBut post honeymoon, in August 2015, she was ready to battle the bulge once and for all – joining Weight Watchers. \nThree months in to the diet, she slipped down the stairs, dislocating her ankle, also needing a plate and screws in the joint and plenty of rest.
