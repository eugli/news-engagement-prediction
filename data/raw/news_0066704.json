(Susan Walsh/AP)   1:03 PM \nHmm, equal pay but disorganization? \nDuring her controversial speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Thursday, Kellyanne Conway slammed modern feminism and attempted to describe her version of “conservative” feminism. \nFollowing President Donald Trump’s senior counselor’s speech, Merriam-Webster dictionary took to social media to address the immediate spike in lookups for “feminism.” A crowd fills Independence Avenue during the Women's March on Washington, Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017 in Washington. (Alex Brandon/AP) \nThe site wrote that Conway “both called for equal pay for women and said that she didn’t identify herself as a feminist.” \nKellyanne Conway slams feminism as 'anti-male' and 'pro-abortion' \nMerriam-Webster, after describing Conway’s own definition of the term, was sure to remind visitors what “feminism” means: the word is described “as both ‘the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities’ and ‘organized activity in support of women’s rights and interests.’” \nThe site continued by posting, “It entered the language in 1895, at a time when efforts for women’s political equality were becoming organized and widespread in England and the United States.” \nIn Conway’s speech, deriding feminism in the modern sense for having been co-opted by the left and being “very anti-male” and “certainly very pro-abortion,” she declared for a sort of “individual feminism.” \nConway touted herself as a “product of my choices, not a victim of my circumstances.” She described that as “conservative feminism.” \nShe also said that, “One thing that’s been a little disappointing and revealing that I hope will get better is it turns out a lot of women just have a problem with women in power...” \nConway also spoke about her blue-collar upbringing and how her mother “didn’t feel sorry for herself.” Kellyanne Conway appears prior to a forum at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Mass. in December. (Charles Krupa/AP) \nShe also advised women how to succeed in the workplace — especially in striving for equal pay. \nConway has faced recent backlash over her cable TV appearances — ones in which she appeared to be on a different page than other White House staffers. \nUniversity takes aim at alumna Kellyanne Conway \nAmong those in Trump’s cabinet, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Chief Strategist Steve Bannon and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus are also scheduled to speak at CPAC. \nIn addition to the Merriam-Webster tweet, social media has teed off on the embattled Conway. Here’s a look at some of the best responses to her speech: 📈'Feminism' is defined as \"the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities.\" https://t.co/Zjf7CAPUjL", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:54:01.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
