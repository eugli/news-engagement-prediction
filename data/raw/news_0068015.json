Khavari has been in custody since his arrest. He remains silent on all charges and did not allow himself to be questioned by forensic medical experts. Investigators suspected that Khavari was lying when he said he was 17, as he had already told Greek authorities he was 17 back in 2013 before he came to Germany. Maria, whose father is a legal adviser to the European Commission in Brussels, was killed in October last year The new report on his age clears the way for prosecutors to charge him as an adult, meaning that if convicted, he could face a life sentence. Following his arrest, it emerged that he had been sentenced to ten years in jail in Greece after he threw a 20-year-old student off a cliff on the island of Corfu in May 2013. The woman was severely injured but miraculously survived the ordeal and was able to identify her attacker. Khavari was placed in youth detention and it is unclear why he was freed so soon into his prison sentence. He did not report to parole officers after his early release and authorities issued a search warrant for the Afghan migrant, but only in Greece. German authorities have slammed the Greek authorities for 'negligence', saying that if they had known about Khavari's past, he would not have been allowed into the country.
