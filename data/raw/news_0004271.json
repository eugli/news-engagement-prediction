The ultra-conservative provocateur, Breitbart News editor and Donald Trump admirer Milo Yiannopoulos speaks on campus in the Mathematics building at the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colo Credit: AP Our Foreign Staff 3 February 2017 • 12:31am \nM ilo Yiannopoulos, the ultra-conservative British journalist and provocateur, has hit the headlines once again after his planned appearance at the University of California, Berkeley, descended into a riot. \nMr Yiannopoulos was evacuated and the event cancelled after a crowd threw smoke bombs and smashed windows. The incident prompted President Donald Trump to tweet: If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017 \nT he 32-year-old journalist, who is a prominent figure of America's \"alt-right\" movement , is a passionate Trump supporter and is an editor at Breitbart News, which was previously run by Stephen Bannon , a key aide of the president. \nHe is a self-proclaimed internet troll who has been widely criticised for comments he has made about Muslims, Black Lives Matter activists and feminists. \nYiannopoulos' talks have sparked protests , shouting matches and occasional violence at stops around the country. A man was shot and wounded at protests outside his January 21 talk at the University of Washington. \nRowdy protests at UC Davis on January 13 prompted campus Republicans to cancel his appearance at the last minute. His final stop was supposed to be UCLA on Thursday but the invitation was rescinded. In brief | Milo Yiannopoulos Response to Berkeley protest \nY iannopoulos, who was born in Greece, took to Facebook to criticise the protests against his talk at Berkeley: \nH e told Fox News: \"Obviously it's a liberal campus so they hate any libertarians or conservatives who dare to express an opinion on their campuses. They particularly don't like me.\" 'Free-speech fundamentalist': Yiannopoulos' controversial views \nYiannopoulos has sparked controversy for his offensive views on a number of subjects. On Muslims \nTheir outfits are hilarious. Ridiculous. Is there anything more comically sinister than the sight of a herd of women swathed in black bedsheets? Anything more unintentionally ironic about a religion that hates gays that gets its men in a room together 5 times a day to stick their asses in the air? On gays \nIn the course of my Dangerous Faggot tour, I’ve had my fair share of bans… but here’s one I didn’t see coming. I’ve been banned from San Francisco! Me, the gayest person on the planet. Banned. From San Francisco, the queerest city in America. Apparently I’m just too dangerous of a faggot, even for a city that pumps AZT directly into the water. Alas, Milo-roni will not become the new San Francisco treat any time soon. On Black Lives Matter \nFor any Black Lives Matter activists who have snuck their way in, blacks have the highest obesity rates in America at 47.8 percent. If you combine obese and overweight, it can reach to 76 percent. If Black Lives Matter cared about black people, in addition to their fact-free musings about police officers, they would be organising aerobics classes, not protesting the police. If Black Lives Matter cared about black lives, they’d be fire-bombing McDonald’s, not their local neighbourhoods. On comparisons to Trump \nThe strength of feeling in my crowds, the enthusiasm for me from the audiences is the same - the same instinct, the same sort of motivating force (that) put Trump in the White House... It's almost cool to be Republican now. Twitter ban \nIn July last year, Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter for life for his role in the online abuse of Leslie Jones over her role in the new Ghostbusters film. \nHe described Ghostbusters as \"a movie to help lonely middle-aged women feel better about being left on the shelf\". Twitter trolls attacked Jones with racist slurs . \nYiannopoulos accused Jones of playing the “victim” for complaining about receiving hate mail, described her reply to him as \"barely literate\" and called her a \"black dude\". Book sales soaring \nSales are soaring for Yiannopoulos' upcoming book but details of his promotional tour - assuming there is one - are a mystery for now. \nA spokeswoman for Threshold Editions, the conservative imprint at Simon & Schuster, declined comment on Thursday when asked where Yiannopoulos was expected to appear on behalf of \"Dangerous\". The book is scheduled to come out on March 14 and was in the top 10 on Amazon as of Thursday afternoon, the day after violent protests led the University of California, Berkeley to cancel a scheduled talk by Yiannopoulos. \nThe controversy that has driven pre-orders for \"Dangerous\" has also made promotion unusually complicated. \nYiannopoulos' book deal was greeted with immediate anger when announced in late December. Hundreds of authors have objected and one writer, Roxane Gay, withdrew a book she had planned for Simon & Schuster. \nMany independent sellers have expressed uneasiness, saying they will make the book available if asked for, but will not promote it. One store, The Booksmith in San Francisco, has announced it will neither stock the book nor order a copy upon customer request. Booksmith also said it was cutting orders for Simon & Schuster books by 50 per cent. \n\"While we respect Simon's decision to publish any book, we reserve the right to allocate our discretionary inventory dollars with publishers who act with ethical & moral standards consistent with our own,\" reads a posting from the store on http://www.booksmith.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:39:43.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
