That's because it's flattering on every skin tone and has an energetic, modern vibe that brings neutral clothes to life. A few years ago bright blue cotton suits were everywhere, but this winter it's all about the heavy-duty blue hoodie . Layered up with your favorite wardrobe staples like chinos, denim jackets, white T-shirts, and canvas sneakers, it's a total menswear flex. But because it's an ordinary sweatshirt, and not a suit, it requires basically zero effort to incorporate into your wardrobe. In other words, it's the lazy man's way to look stylish right now. \nThanks to luxury brand's recent infatuation with athleticism , some of the bright blue hoodies on the market right now will set you back close to a grand. They're cut perfectly, with just the right amount of weight, and if you've got a well-paying job we wouldn't blame you for picking one up. For those of you would wouldn't dream of spending $800 on something you could easily wear on a basketball court or to bed, contemporary brands like MKI and Nanamica and old-school labels like Champion produce them for a fraction of the cost. You could even really save a buck and pick up one from a high-street brand like Topman. \nNo matter which way you go, you've cheated the system with this move. Like the red beanie trend of 2015, looking stylish doesn't get easier than a cotton basic in a bright color.
