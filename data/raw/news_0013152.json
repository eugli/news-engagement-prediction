(Scott Eisen/Getty Images) × \nTrump's most serious challenge, as he begins his third week in office, is his fight with the judiciary over the legality of his policies on immigration and refugees. He has tangled with federal Judge James Robart, whom Trump disdained as a \"so-called judge\" after Robart ruled against Trump's temporary ban on entry into the U.S. of people from seven Muslim-majority countries. \nTrump also had a contentious phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over how many refugees the Trump administration would admit to the United States in keeping with a deal made with Trump's predecessor Barack Obama. \nThe trigger for all this was Trump's executive order on Jan. 27 in which, among other things, he temporarily halted immigration from seven mostly Muslim nations and also temporarily banned Syrian refugees from entering the United States. Trump said he was trying to keep terrorists out of the U.S. \nBut Robart, who is based in Seattle, blocked Trump's executive order, at least temporarily, and on Sunday a federal appeals court allowed Robart's decision to stand. The issue is being appealed by the Trump administration and may go to the Supreme Court. \nTrump escalated his attack on Robart by writing on Twitter Sunday, \"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\" \nTrump also caused problems for himself when he defended Russian leader Vladimir Putin , who is viewed by both Democratic and Republican members of Congress as a thug who is trying to undermined U.S. interests.
