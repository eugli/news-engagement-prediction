From Davidoff Studios/Getty Images. As with most things pertaining to Donald Trump , there is bewildering outrage regarding Melania Trump’s libel claim, filed recently in a New York state court over a story the Daily Mail posted online that alleged Melania once worked as an escort. The story, since retracted by the Mail , will, according to the filing, apparently prevent her from properly cashing in as First Lady. Months after the story appeared, this past August, Melania Trump’s lawyers recently noted in a February 6 court filing that the First Lady’s “brand” had lost “significant value” and that “major business opportunities” in the “multiple millions of dollars” that “were otherwise available to her have been lost and/or substantially impacted.” Her attorneys further lamented that Melania Trump “had the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as an extremely famous and well-known person, as well as a former professional model and brand spokesperson, and successful businesswoman, to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories,” among them apparel, accessories, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care, skin care, and fragrance. As my colleague Emily Jane Fox recently noted , Melania Trump is at least being transparent about the way that other members of her family may be viewing the White House—as a vessel to get filthy rich. The New York Times editorial board seemed to find Melania Trump’s crass commercialism appalling. “Mrs. Trump is certainly entitled to challenge the accuracy of that allegation and to argue that it was defamatory,” the editorial board wrote. “But her assessment of the damage the claim has done to her earning potential is galling, and revelatory.” This isn't entirely surprising, but what is notable is the fact that the First Lady appears to be simply plucking a page from her husband’s playbook. Back in January 2006, then businessman Donald Trump sued Timothy L. O’Brien , then a staff writer at The New York Times , for reporting in the paper (and then in his book TrumpNation , published a few days later) that Trump’s net worth was likely between $150 million and $250 million , rather than the $4 billion to $5 billion that O’ Brien says Trump claimed. (During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump said that his net worth exceeded $10 billion .) Trump, who sued O'Brien and his publisher, wanted $5 billion in damages. In a deposition during the suit, Trump made the exact same claim that his wife would make in her court filing more than a decade later. His legal team suggested that what Trump had perceived to be a defamatory newspaper article had deprived him of millions of dollars in lost business opportunities. Melania Trump’s legal strategy, in many ways, is a simulacrum of her husband’s previous litigation. During the deposition , Trump cited two specific examples of how O’Brien’s article—and the diminished perception of his net worth that it fostered—cost him future earnings. Both opportunities, he said, came to him through Howard Lorber , then the chairman of Douglas Elliman, a real-estate brokerage that was part of Prudential Finance. A month or so before O’Brien’s story appeared, Trump testified that Lorber had called Trump to see whether he wanted to work with the Italian owners of a building at 400 Fifth Avenue to develop it into a major hotel and condominium tower. Coincidentally, Trump testified that he had been looking to develop the nearby Lord & Taylor site, at 40th Street and Fifth Avenue, but Lorber convinced him that the 400 Fifth Avenue site was better. Trump met with the Italians. “It looked like it was a deal made in heaven,” Trump said during his deposition. He loved the site, and even though the meeting was preliminary, he felt that everything added up. “What I do for a living is deals, and I know when they’re going to happen and when they’re not,” he continued. “This is a deal that was going to happen.” He said he suggested a mixed-use purpose for the building along the lines of how he had redeveloped One Central Park West, at Columbus Circle. He figured he’d get a 25 percent stake in the project, without putting up any capital. “I said, ‘It will be a tremendous success,’” he recalled. “The market was blazing hot. And they were all excited about it. And they left my office extremely excited.” But then the Italians read O’Brien’s reporting. Lorber called him back and told him the Italians had decided not to proceed with a deal. The future president wondered what had happened. “‘Because they read the article in the Times , and they read the book,’” he said Lorber told him. “’They’re not going to make a deal.’” Trump spoke with the Italians himself, but it was no use. “Houdini couldn’t have sold them on the deal,” Trump said during the deposition. “So I lost potentially a couple of hundred million dollars on that deal because of this false book.” There is some truth in Trump’s point. As Lorber put it to me recently, the Italians got spooked about Trump after reading O’Brien’s article. Indeed, 400 Fifth Avenue is now a gleaming 60-story tower designed by Gwathmey Siegel. ( It was built without Trump’s involvement. ) “A foreigner comes and he reads it in The New York Times and he assumes that, well, What am I missing?” Lorber said. “Maybe I was not told the truth about Mr. Trump. And so they decided not to go in that direction.” The second lost business opportunity involved Lorber directly, Trump testified. The idea was to create something to be called Trump Realty, essentially a branded unit within Douglas Elliman’s best real-estate team. Trump, who stood to get as much as 25 percent for lending his name, said in his deposition that he had more than 20 conversations with Lorber about the project. “He loved this idea,” Trump said. “He liked it more than I did.” The day after O’Brien’s story ran in the Times , Lorber told Trump he was having second thoughts: “‘We’ve got to hold it off, because it’s not a deal that’s going to be good after this.’” In the end, Trump lost the suit against O’Brien, as well as its appeal. The courts ruled O’Brien had not libeled him and he was not entitled to $5 billion as a result. It’ll be interesting to see whether the recycled legal strategy will get a different result for Melania. Meanwhile, all these years later, and from the highest office in the land, her husband still seems intent on picking on journalists.
