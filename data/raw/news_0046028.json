My filings are up to date n completely in compliance with regulatory/statutory requirements,\" Karti tweeted. \n\n\"My family's n my assets are duly reflected in our IT filings. My companies have made all declarations as required by statutory requirements,\" he added. \n\nSwamy also targeted former finance minister P Chidambaram alleging there were irregularities in the clearances given for the Aircel-Maxis deal during his tenure.
