Chris Christie says President Donald Trump made him order meatloaf when they dined together at the White House this week. Christie and his wife, Mary Pat, joined Trump at the White House on Tuesday. The Republican governor said while guest hosting a New York sports talk radio show Thursday that Trump pointed out the menu and told people to get whatever they want. Then he said he and Christie were going to have the meatloaf. “This is what it’s like to be with Trump,” Christie said. “He says, ‘There’s the menu, you guys order whatever you want.’ And then he says, ‘Chris, you and I are going to have the meatloaf.’” Trump said “I’m telling you, the meatloaf is fabulous,” according to Christie. \nSo Chris Christie was on Boomer and Carton yesterday morning because hes the a fake politician and wants to be a radio host. Hes actually pretty good at it, if we’re being honest. I like when he fills in for Boomer much more than Chris Simms. \nBut anyway, he willingly told this story of when The Donald cucked him at a White House lunch. Ordering the meatloaf for him as if it was 1950 and they were on a date. Christie tried to spin it simply as Donald recommended because it was so good, but everyone in the world knows that Donald’s favorite thing in the world is cucking Chris Christie. His order of favorite things is like: \n3) Tweeting \n2) roasting Rosie O’Donnell \n1) Publicly humiliating Chris Christie \nBottom line is you just cant let another man force you to eat meatloaf at lunch. Even if you really want the meatloaf. Even if you’re the biggest meatloaf fan in the world. The minute Donald Trump tries to order your lunch for you and make you eat meatloaf, you gotta switch up your order. Say “No thanks Donald, I’ll have the pot roast” and have some pride, Fat Man. \nPS – Shout out to Carton and Al Dukes. Hilarious that their show is going viral in the political world. A US governor, co hosting a sports show, talking about meatloaf, going viral in politics. Just how they drew it up! #SportsGuys", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T16:37:36.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
