ADVERTISEMENT \nThe transport board earlier approved the petition filed by the Philippine National Taxi Operators Association (PNTOA). It cited rising fuel prices, the same reason behind the P1 provisional jeepney fare hike implemented last week. \nIn March 2016, the taxi flagdown rate was slashed by P10 when pump prices ranged from P29 to P37 for gasoline. By January this year, prices stood at P42 to P45 per liter. \nThe LTFRB said it would later address the PNTOA petition to raise the taxi fare per succeeding 300 meters and two minutes waiting time to P5.50 from the current P3.50.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:57:55.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
