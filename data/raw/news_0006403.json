But his treatment of Turnbull was particularly striking because of the tight bond between the United States and Australia — countries that share intelligence, support one another diplomatically and have fought together in wars including in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe characterizations provide insight into Trump’s temperament and approach to the diplomatic requirements of his job as the nation’s chief executive, a role in which he continues to employ both the uncompromising negotiating tactics he honed as a real estate developer and the bombastic style he exhibited as a reality television personality. \nThe depictions of Trump’s calls are also at odds with sanitized White House accounts. The official read-out of his conversation with Turnbull, for example, said that the two had “emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the U.S.-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally.” \nThe paper says the US president told the PM “I don’t want these people”, but it was his “intention” to honor the deal. Trump apparently kept mistakenly saying the deal involved 2,000 refugees, rather the 1,250 in the detail. \nAccording to the Australian Department of Immigration, there are 383 detainees on Nauru and 871 on Manus, a total of 1,254 mostly from Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Somalia, four of the seven countries on Trump’s temporary migration ban list announced on the weekend. \nAccording to The Post, when the Australian leader tried to move the conversation on, Trump hung up on Turnbull only halfway into the scheduled hour-long conversation. \nThe prime minister faced reporters in Canberra after the Washington Post report emerged to say he wasn’t going to comment on it, but said “the deal will be honoured”. \n“I’m not going to comment on a conversation between myself and the president of the United States, other than what we have said publicly,” he said. \n“You can surely understand the reasons for that. I appreciate your interest, but it’s better that these conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately if ah, you see reports on them, I’m not going to add to them”. \nAsked if the two leaders clashed, Turnbull said: “Australians know me. I always stand up for Australia in every forum.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:26:04.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
