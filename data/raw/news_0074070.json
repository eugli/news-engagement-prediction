Pool/Staff Photographer Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott (21) hurdles Philadelphia Eagles free safety Rodney McLeod (23) during the first half of an NFL football game at AT&T Stadium on Sunday, Oct. 30, 2016, in Arlington. (Smiley N. Pool/The Dallas Morning News) By SportsDayDFW.com Contact SportsDayDFW.com on Twitter: @SportsDayDFW \nEzekiel Elliott and the Cowboys' Super Bowl hopes were common topics of conversation at a 25th anniversary of Dallas' Super Bowl win over Buffalo hosted by Troy Aikman. \nTony Dorsett -- who had his rookie rushing record broken by Elliott this season -- was asked about what scares him when Zeke hurdles defenders: Tony Dorsett says it scares him every time Ezekiel Elliott leaps a defender. \"He needs to stop that.\" Thinks it will stop as he gets older — Jon Machota (@jonmachota) February 26, 2017 \nEmmitt Smith also offered up his thoughts on Zeke's hurdles, as well as what he likes most about the running back's game: What goes through Emmitt Smith's mind when he sees Ezekiel Elliott leap over a defender? \"Get on the ground as quickly as possible.\" — Jon Machota (@jonmachota) February 26, 2017 What Emmitt Smith likes most about Ezekiel Elliott's game: He always finishes forward, vision and \"a hell of a jump cut.\" — Jon Machota (@jonmachota) February 26, 2017 \nAnd Smith, who knows a thing or two about winning Super Bowls, said the Cowboys are a defensive line away from competing for the franchise's sixth Lombardi Trophy. Emmitt Smith says current Cowboys are a defensive line away from Super Bowl. Says line on his teams were bad to the bone. — Kate Hairopoulos (@khairopoulos) February 26, 2017 \nSmith shares that opinion with many experts. SportsDay's Jon Machota recently said in a chat that he believes that the pass rush needs outweigh any secondary needs and \"it's not close.\" \n\"But good luck finding one,\" he said. \"Denver and Oakland have two of the best, and they'd gladly draft another one over a position of need. It's far more likely a team will find a quality CB such as Anthony Brown in the sixth round than an effective pass rusher after Round 2. If the Cowboys had a good pass rush, everything on the back end would improve. I know Randy Moss recently said the Cowboys need a shutdown corner that can follow another team's No. 1 WR all over the field. That's great, but I look at the Green Bay game and think of how little that would've mattered. Pressure on Rodgers is more important that taking away his top receiving option. The elite QBs, the ones you'll face in the playoffs, will be just fine throwing to their No. 2, 3 and 4 options if there is little to no pressure on them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T07:10:57.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
