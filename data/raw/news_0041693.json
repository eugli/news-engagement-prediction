Korea demands role in probe Strong words: Kang entering his car at the embassy in Jalan Batai, Bukit Damansara. — Bernama \nKUALA LUMPUR: North Korea has cast doubts on Malaysia’s investigation into the assassination of Kim Jong-nam and demanded that it be allowed to take part in a joint probe into the killing. \nJust hours after being summoned by Wisma Putra, Ambassador Kang Chol said the incident had been politicised by Malaysia, “in collusion with South Korea”. \n“It has been seven days since the incident, but there is no clear evidence on the cause of the death. \n“At the moment we cannot trust the investigation by the Malaysian police although its result would be obtained,” he said outside the gates of the embassy in Jalan Batai, Bukit Damansara. \nKang said North Korea wanted the setting up of a joint investigation following contradictions on the ongoing probe. \n“If Malaysia agrees to our suggestion, we will dispatch a lawyers’ delegation. This shows our determination to clarify this incident, through a joint investigation with the Malaysian police,” a serious-looking Kang told the huge number of media, which included the international press from South Korea, Japan and the United States. \nSome journalists camped out under the hot sun in front of the embassy since early afternoon, eager not to miss a rare opportunity to interact with Kang, who only spoke out briefly on the controversy at the Hospital Kuala Lumpur morgue near midnight on Friday. \nThe ambassador, dressed in a dark suit and gold tie and flanked by embassy officials, was seen wiping his face during the press conference held under the blazing heat. \nKang also accused Malaysian police of allegedly threatening the family of a North Korean citizen and beating up the latter’s son when police raided his condominium in Kuala Lumpur. \n“Last Friday night, the Malaysian plainclothes police raided the condominium of our citizen here in Kuala Lumpur and forcibly arrested him without any warrant or evidence,” he said, slamming the police action of publicising the raid and announcing that the person arrested was “the mastermind” before any formal inquiry. \n“They also aired on TV the scene where the said person was arrested. They even pointed guns at his family members to threaten their lives and beat his teenage son in the face. This is a human rights abuse that can be seen only in a US gang film,” he said. \nKang questioned the delay in ascertaining the cause of the death of the “victim”. \n“The embassy had already identified the victim as Kim Chol, a North Korean citizen, as mentioned in his passport. \n“However, the Malaysian police have not yet ascertained the cause of his death and not offered the criminal evidence of the suspects. \n“They rather focus on identifying the other name alleged by the hostile forces against North Korea, unlawfully requesting the presence of his next of kin for the identification and DNA test to delay the release of the body,” he said. \nHe reiterated that North Korea had the right to request for the investigation result and demanded to meet with the suspects who were detained by the police. \n“Particularly, there is an allegation (by South Korean media) that the arrested female suspects murdered him by poison needles or by daubing chemicals in the face. We demand for the meeting with the female suspects to reveal the truth,” said Kang.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:07:03.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
