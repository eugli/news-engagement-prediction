Kaine Geoffrey Jones is led to court today. Picture:.John Grainger   \nMr Wilton was on a two-year road trip around Australia with his partner of 37 years Marlene Wilton, when he was struck down and left for dead on the side of a road at Mannering Park. \nAn agreed statement of facts says Mr Wilton thumped his hand on the bonnet of Mr Jones’ ute which was heard screeching down Griffith Street about 7.30pm. \nJones punched Mr Wilton to the ground and witnesses say he did a burn out before speeding off without helping Mr Wilton. \nLater he tried to disguise his car and told a friend, “[I] just hit a bloke down the road. The guy tried to stop me. I got out of the car. The guy was in my face and I hit him”. \nMr Wilton died two months later in hospital. Victim... Graeme Wilton Source: The Daily Telegraph \nIn a victim impact statement read during sentencing submissions Mrs Wilton told a court last she was “debilitated by grief.” \n“I miss waking up next to him every morning,” she said. \n“The life I knew and loved has now completely gone … my life has been halved.” \nAfter Justice Harrison handed down the sentence Jones’s mother yelled in the courtroom, in full earshot of Mr Wilton’s widow, “How could you do this to my son?”. \nJones who was still standing in the dock yelled out, “Mum, mum – relax,” before he was led down to the holding cells beneath the court by corrective service officers. \nJustice Harrison said Jones’ response to the confrontation with Mr Wilton was “unacceptable”. \n“Mr Jones took it upon himself to respond to Mr Wilton in an unacceptably angry and aggressive manner,” Justice Harrison said. Mr Wilton’s widow Marlene leaves the court. Picture: John Grainger   \n“His actions were literally inexcusable. They are inconsistent with the civilised conduct of any normal society,” he said. \nJustice Harrison said he did not believe Jones’ moral culpability was reduced due to the fact he had a mild intellectual disability. \n“Mr Wilton was a vulnerable person with no opportunity to anticipate or prevent what occurred,” he said. \nOutside of court Mrs Wilton told reporters she would try to get on with her life. \n“Nothing has changed really for me, my husband’s gone but Mr jones was responsible for that and now I’ve got to get on with my life,” she said. \n“It gets easier of course as time goes on but I have my days. \n“It is what it is – I have to accept that.” \nHaving already served 567 days in custody Jones will be eligible for parole on July 17, 2021.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:58:48.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
