As The AV Club points out , Netflix announced the news in a Facebook post early this morning. Back in 2015, show creator Joel Hodgson launched a Kickstarter campaign to bring back MST3K, which ended up breaking the Kickstarter record for video funding. In 2016, Netflix picked up the 14 new episodes that Hodgson made as a result of that $5.7 million in funding. Today’s announcement also came with the first new photo of the cast and crew, featuring Hodgson, host Jonah Ray, Mads Felicia Day, Patton Oswalt, Hampton Yount, and Baron Vaughn. The revival will stream on Netflix in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.
