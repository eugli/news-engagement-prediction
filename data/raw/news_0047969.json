The blood cells in my body are now 100 per cent my sister's blood cells, so in theory that should show that I'm in remission,\" Lealiifano told the ABC. \n\"All along my main motivator has been to one day return and play again, but we'll see how we go. \n\"I'm taking it day by day, and if I get a chance to run around with the team again, that's an extra bonus. \nLealiifano says the specialist he has been seeing in Melbourne shares his high hopes for the future. \n\"He's pretty optimistic with how it's all gone. We've still got a long way to go but at the moment, we've had some great news so far with this little milestone.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:42:44.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
