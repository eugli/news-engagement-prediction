During this time, they also worked as female escorts, reported China Press .\nIt reported that the man they befriended was a spy who introduced Doan to the four men, whom police are hunting down in connection with the assassination.\nSiti Aisyah got involved when Doan was asked by the man to find a partner to shoot a prank video.\nThe two women, who knew each other, apparently rehearsed the \"spoof\" many times and were able to carry out the process proficiently.\nThe report also said that Siti Aisyah was tasked with using a handkerchief to cover Jong-nam's face while Doan administered an injection.\nThe two women have claimed that they had no idea that it would lead to trouble as they thought it was only supposed to be a filming of the prank being carried out.\nChina Press reported that Siti Aisyah claimed to have only met the other male suspects recently, and was unaware who Kim Jong-un or Kim Jong-nam was.\nShe alleged that she was paid US$100 (RM445) to pull off the \"prank\".\nJong-nam, 45, was killed by two women who splashed his face with a chemical at the KLIA2 departure hall at about 9am on Monday as he was about to leave for Macau.\nThe women later got into a taxi and fled.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T10:21:37.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
