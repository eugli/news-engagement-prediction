Dakota Access pipeline opponents burn structures in their main protest camp in southern North Dakota. (James MacPherson/AP) \nAt least four structures were set ablaze as snow began to fall on the protest camp in Southern North Dakota between the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and the pipeline route, CNN reported. \nArmy approves construction of Dakota Access pipeline \nOne of the protesters told the news station the tents at Oceti Sakowin — named for the Seven Council Fires (or tribes) making up the Sioux nation — were purposefully set aflame as a part of a native tradition. Refuse remains in the Dakota Access pipeline opponents' main protest camp as a fire burns in the background. (Blake Nicholson/AP) \nAt its peak in December, the camp, located on federal land near the Missouri River, was busy with thousands of Native Americans, military veterans, environmental activists and other protesters fighting construction of a 1,172-mile oil pipeline near Standing Rock’s Sioux reservation. \nThe tribe has argued the $3.8 billion pipeline — set to bring crude oil from the North Dakota’s Bakken oil patch through the Midwest and into the Gulf Coast — violates their territorial rights from an 1851 treaty, noting it threatened the tribe’s water source and cultural sites. The fires come as authorities prepare to shut down the camp in advance of spring flooding season. (James MacPherson/AP) \nDakota Access pipeline exec compares protesters to terrorists \nThe group received a brief victory from Former President Barack Obama when his administration and the Corps in December announced it would explore other routes for the pipeline away from the reservation. But President Trump last month signed two executive actions that allowed the construction of the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines to continue. \nSeveral protesters told MSNBC they’d vacate the area as per the Corps' request, while others said they intended to stay and be symbolically arrested.
