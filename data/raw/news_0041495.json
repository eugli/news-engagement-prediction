Later, addressing a campaign rally in Pune in the evening, he compared the situation to Emergency. \n\"I just got a message that BJP has complained to Election Commission seeking ban on printing Saamana on February 16, February 20 and February 21. My question is if you blame Indira Gandhi for imposing Emergency, isn't this an Emergency?\" he said. \n\"Why are Chief Minister and Prime Minister going to poll-bound areas for campaigning? Forget all these dates, as long as model code of conduct is in force, CM and PM should not be allowed to do campaigning,\" he said. \nThackeray also said that as talk about \"setting\" between rival parties was rife, \"today I declare that I too have setting and that is with the masses of Maharashtra.
