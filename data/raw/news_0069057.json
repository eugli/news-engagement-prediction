Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation Elections 2017 results are out and there is no clear majority for either Shiv Sena or BJP. While Shiv Sena won 84 seats, BJP 81 seats to its name.\nDevendra Fadnavis addressed a press conference hailing the party’s performance. The BJP made decisive gains in civic polls in Maharashtra retaining power in at least six civic bodies — Pune, Nashik, Ulhasnagar, Akola, Nagpur and Amravati — out of the 10 corporations for which the elections were held on Tuesday.\nCongress was relegated to the third position in the civic body tally with 31 seats followed by NCP with 9 seats. MNS won 7 seats, AIMIM-3, SP-6, Akhil Bhartiya Sena-1 and others-4. The Congress Party has suffered a major setback as the grand old party was only able to win 31 seats in BMC.\nThere was a lot at stake for both Shiv Sena and the BJP, two saffron allies for over 20 years, who have been going through a fallout.
