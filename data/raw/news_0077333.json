'Ah Emma,' the 28-year-old wrote in a post accompanied by a shot in which she was standing in front of an enormous TV as Stone, 28, collected her Oscar. The Hello singer also threw her love toward the makers of the film Moonlight, which captured Best Picture amid a controversial flub that saw La La Land accidentally announced as the winner.

In accepting the film industry's highest honor, Stone said she still has 'a lot of growing and learning and work to do,' with the Oscar statuette functioning as 'a really beautiful symbol to continue on that journey.'
