There was no password, no username, no encryption devices, it was just readily available – and that's the issues that has been deflected so well by the premier. The Liberal website had… private information accessible to anybody in the world.\"\nClark blamed the NDP for the alleged hack on Tuesday, despite having no evidence to offer to back up the criminal accusation.\nShe also suggested forces were attempting to undermine the democratic process, which Huntington said was the last straw in her decision to come forward.\n\"Here's a premier whose office is engaged in triple-deleting, who has used government employees to develop strategies for quick wins in ethnic communities, who invites wealthy donors into her offices, who has refused any attempt at parliamentary reform,\" Huntington said.\n\"Really what we're talking about is the pot calling the kettle black.\"\nClark, after issuing her apology, thanked Huntington for coming forward and promised the Liberals will be reviewing how the information was handled.\n\"The privacy of personal information, it's a really serious matter and the party is going to ensure that the proper protocols were in place to protect information in its possession,\" Clark said.\nHorgan has yet to respond to the premier’s statement, but had been demanding an apology since she pointed the finger at his party.\nOn Thursday, Horgan said her accusation raises concerning questions about Clark’s credibility leading into May’s election.\n\"When your leader thinks it's OK to pull things out of thin air for a few days and run with it, it's troubling,\" he said. \"It speaks to the premier's character.\"\nThe party also previously said it was contacting a lawyer about Clark’s hacking allegation. \n \nIndependent MLA Vicki Huntington via statement: staff saw sensitive info on Liberal website, blames Libs for breach, says it wasn't a hack.\n— CTV Bhinder Sajan (@BhinderSajan) February 10, 2017 Huntington calls premier's suggestion someone was trying to subvert democracy, \"outrageous\" & points to triple-delete and quick win scandals\n— CTV Bhinder Sajan (@BhinderSajan) February 10, 2017 Related Stories Premier admits she drew 'quick conclusion' with hacking allegation Christy Clark dials back stunning hacking allegation against NDP Photos B.C.
