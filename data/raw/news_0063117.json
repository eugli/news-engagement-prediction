Credit AvroKO Hospitality Group Back in 2003, when Public opened in NoLIta, it was something of a game changer. The menu tipped its hat to the Antipodes, even offering grilled kangaroo with coriander falafel, and its industrial-vintage design, incorporating elements like antique mailboxes, card catalogs and office doors with glass panels, was not then as typical as it is today. Now, Public is doing something that is becoming all too common in the New York restaurant world. It’s closing its doors. Public has lost its lease, not as a result of some astronomical rent increase, but because of new construction: The building it is in will undergo extensive renovations for about two years, making the restaurant space unworkable. “Our hands are tied,” said Brad Farmerie, the chef and a partner. Saturday, June 3, will be the restaurant’s last day of service. “We can’t see moving it,” Mr. Farmerie said. “Public is so specific to the neighborhood, the space and its history.” Mr. Farmerie, a Pittsburgh native who was working in London before he took the job at Public, said they would have “three months to celebrate.” In addition to Mr. Farmerie, Public’s owners — his brother Adam Farmerie; William Harris; Kristina O’Neal; and Greg Bradshaw — also own the company, AvroKO, that designed it. The firm was unknown when Public opened; now its restaurant company, AvroKO Hospitality Group, has a portfolio of its own, including Genuine Roadside in New York and Saxon & Parole, with locations in New York and Moscow. The company also designed Quality Meats and the Gotham West Market. Follow NYT Food's board Food News on Pinterest. Public, which has a Michelin star and has won several James Beard awards, was an incubator for a number of highly respected chefs, including Matt Lambert of the Musket Room , Ann Redding of Uncle Boons and Mr. Donahue’s , and Matt Hyland of Pizza Loves Emily and Emmy Squared. Some of these chefs will return to Public and take a turn before it closes.
