Ornan-Stone, a design researcher at The Boeing Company, told news.com.au . \n\"There are five levels of darkness and at the darkest you can sleep very comfortably but you're still able to look outside.\" \nThe cabin crew will also be able to control the level of darkness with the press of a button. Nicole Precel, ABC News \nQantas is introducing direct flights from Perth to London in 2018, marking the first time Australians will be able to fly direct to Europe.

Craig Platt \nQantas' new Dreamliner will feature a \"business suite\" that makes it easier for passengers flying together. \nHowever, it's not the first airline to introduce aircraft without window shades after Boeing ditched the plastic one for the Dreamliner. Air New Zealand was the first airline globally to take delivery of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:02:38.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
