On Jan. 31, the association announced it had suspended Lapierre for the 2016-2017 season.\nThe league also agreed to work with the crisis centre to develop a program to teach players about respect for women.\nPickford described the union's decision as \"disappointing,\" especially as many former players and parents of current players belong to automotive unions.\n\"They have a huge membership and, of course, a lot of the membership is women, and I understand they are upset,\" he said.\nAuto unions are big sponsors Unifor sponsored the hockey association to the tune of $500 last year, according to Pickford. The board has reached out to the union to try and repair their relationship in hopes they can bring funding back on board before next year.\n\"The automotive unions in the city have sponsored Windsor Minor Hockey for years and years,\" he explained. \"They have contributed quite a bit.\"\nIf Unifor does not agree to sponsor the association again, Pickford said it will still be able to operate next season.\nWindsor Minor Hockey president under fire for social media posts\n\"It's disheartening to see them withdraw their sponsorship,\" he said. \"Hopefully we can rectify the whole situation, deal with it in an appropriate manner, learn from it, correct it and move ahead.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:16:50.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
