Credit Greg Von Doersten for The New York Times The travel industry responded by turns critically and cautiously to President Trump’s executive order issued last week that bans travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days. The order applies to citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, prompting protests at airports across the country over the weekend as airlines and immigration agents scrambled to comply with the new directive. The American Airlines chief executive, Doug Parker, called the order “divisive” in an open letter to employees posted on the company’s website on Monday. Expedia is supporting a lawsuit filed by Washington State against the president’s order. The chief executive of TripAdvisor, Steve Kaufer, published an open letter on LinkedIn that criticized the policy, calling it “not only heartless and discriminatory, but also against the principles that make our country great.” Continue reading the main story Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, went further on Twitter , posting that the company will provide temporary free housing to refugees. A company spokesman said that Airbnb hosts may offer their rooms without charge or receive a subsidy from Airbnb. He added that the company was working on requests from people affected by the ban but did not provide more information. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Of the seven nations singled out by the executive order, only Iran drew significant interest on the part of leisure travelers. Among North American travelers, trips to Iran with Intrepid Travel had grown 35 percent in the past year, on pace with Iceland, Japan and Sri Lanka, three other trending destinations. Cox & Kings said it had doubled its traffic to Iran in the past 12 months. Wilderness Travel went from offering one itinerary in 2016 to three in 2017. The founder of Abercrombie & Kent , Geoffrey Kent, singled out Iran as a top destination in 2017. These and other operators say previously announced trips will run. They have taken a wait-and-see position regarding whether Iran will retaliate with its own travel ban, as its government has suggested. “Our customers are very adventurous and want to travel, so probably there would be a shift in travel rather than canceling and staying home for a year,” said Warren Chan, the chief operating officer of Cox & Kings. Getting into Iran requires a visa that travelers can apply for no sooner than 90 days before their trip, said Annie Lucas, vice president of Mir Corporation , a tour operator based in Seattle that has been guiding trips in Iran for close to 20 years. “You can’t get one a year in advance,” Ms. Lucas said. “There’s a timeline. That’s what calls it all into question. There are a lot of people waiting for approvals.” The presidential directive set a 90-day deadline to review the United States’ procedures for vetting travelers from the seven countries.
