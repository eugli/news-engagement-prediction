I don't know what's going on! But I think back in the '60s it just was much more open.' Feud stars Susan as Bette Davis and follows the rivalry between her and Joan Crawford, plated Jessica Lange. The life and soul: Susan has said that she is a 'serial monogamist' and therefore had no time to experiment Speaking out: The actress said her 'sexual orientation is up for grabs' Youthful: Susan was promoting her part in Feud on Tuesday, in New York Crawford is famously described as having an 'indiscriminate and voracious sexual appetite' that knew no bounds. It is based on their time together on the set of the classic movie Whatever Happened To Baby Jane? Catherine Zeta Jones will play legend Olivia de Havilland, whilst Kiernan Shipka takes on the role of B. D. Hyman. The FX show, which also stars Kathy Bates, Stanley Tucci, Alfred Molina, Sarah Paulson and Judy Davis is set to premiere on US TV on March 5. Susan also explained that she has always had an affinity with 'outsiders' as she feels like one herself. Split: Susan is thought to be single again, following her split from Jonathan Bricklin (here in January 2014) who was more than 30 years her junior She explained: 'I feel like an outsider myself. My people, my family for all these years have always been my allies and have always been very, very important to me, very dear to me through the AIDS crisis and everything. It's just a natural, very easy extended family for me.' Previously, in 2015, when the actress told Ellen DeGeneres that she was 'actively looking' for a new love, she said: 'I would leave open the age, the colour, the gender even. I’m open. It increases your chances, doesn’t it?' Ellen - who wed Portia de Rossi in 2008 - famously came out in 1997 and quickly became one of Hollywood's most high profile lesbians. Three years previous, actress Susan told The Metro newspaper in the UK: 'It doesn’t matter the age, race, gender of the person you choose to be with. 'What’s difficult is being intimate with another human being. Once you learn to do that, the rest is just details. ‘There are so many people who found themselves in unforeseen situations. Where you come down on the sexual spectrum is very flexible but it takes courage to be vulnerable to another person – that’s the big step that has to be taken.’ She was talking about her 2011 role in Jeff, Who Lives At Home, when she explored widowed and divorced characters who were turning to other women. Long-term relationship: Susan was with RTim Robbins for 23 years (here in 2003) until their separated in 2009 In reference to her self-confessed 'serial monogamy', last year, she ended her five-year relationship with Jonathan Bricklin, a man more than 30 years her junior. Sarandon met Jonathan on a road trip to Chile in 2010, the year after she split from Tim Robbins, with whom she had been in a long-term partnership since 1988. Until 2009, she was thought to be blissfully happy with her partner of 23 years Tim, father to their two sons Jack, 27, and Miles, 24, as well as Eva, 32, her daughter from an earlier relationship. Then out of the blue Tim, 54, went through what he’s called ‘a midlife crisis’ and ‘insanity’ and the couple separated. Before that, Susan married actor Chris Sarandon at just 21 years old, in 1968, but it ended in divorce in 1979.
