Or so he thought. \nAfter emerging victorious from the halftime promotion, Lodgson, 20, was informed that he would not be eligible to receive the prize because he had played high school basketball within the past six years. \n“It is a huge bummer as I am an out-of-state student,” Logsdon told the Courier-Journal . “It would have went a long way to paying off student loans and anything in that manner. It was still an awesome experience and something I’ll never forget. Very bittersweet though.” \n\"The contest was administered by Million Dollar Media, and unfortunately, the student didn’t meet a couple of the stipulations, which are very specific,\" a university spokesperson told the Courier-Journal . \"However, we are excited for him and are working on some items, so he doesn’t go away empty handed.\" Ranking the 25 fastest players in NFL Combine history Start SlideShow \nNot having played high school basketball within the past six years is a pretty specific barrier to participating in the contest and a sign that these contests are about brands creating the appearance of being magnanimous while actually being anything but.
