(Photo: USA TODAY Sports, Instagram) \nLeBron James posted a photo of Charles Oakley on Wednesday night with the following caption: \n\"Mood!! #legend\" \nThe timing suggests James is siding with Oakley, who was arrested at the Knicks game at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night. A photo posted by LeBron James (@kingjames) on Feb 8, 2017 at 8:23pm PST \nJames appearing to side with Oakley over the New York franchise comes just a week after James told ESPN about how Knicks president Phil Jackson completely ignored him at a game two years ago: \n\"I went to see Melo at the Garden two years ago when we were in New York,\" James said. \"They played Portland. I went up to a suite at halftime, and Phil Jackson didn't say one word to me.\" \nHere's more about Oakley's arrest, per USA TODAY Sports : \nHe was charged with three counts of assault inside of Madison Square Garden and will receive a desk appearance ticket, according to an NYPD spokesperson. \nOakley, seated directly behind Knicks' owner James Dolan, who he has had an acrimonious relationship with for years, was alleged to have been shouting at Dolan. \nAfter he was pulled from the stands and into a tunnel underneath, he was handcuffed by the NYPD. He grew angrier, screaming to release him, that he was not going anywhere. Phil Jackson came down and tried to calm him down, but Oakley was heard by witnesses screaming, \"Dolan did this.\" \nA video from the incident shows Oakley on the ground surrounded by security and police officers . In a statement, the Knicks said Oakley \"behaved in a highly inappropriate and completely abusive manner,\" and that they \"hope he gets some help soon.\" Read or Share this story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/lebron-charles-oakley-legend-knicks-arrest-new-york-phil-jackson-mood-instagram/ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T12:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:43:05.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
