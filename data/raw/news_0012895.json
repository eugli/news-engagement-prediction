[Photo/Agencies] \nBRUSSELS - NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and US President Donald Trump stressed the need for continued efforts to ensure fair burden-sharing among the ll NATO allies over phone, NATO said in a statement Monday. \nThe two leaders discussed by telephone on Sunday evening, during which they \"reconfirmed the importance of the Alliance in troubled times, reviewed progress on the fight against terrorism and on NATO defence spending\", according to the statement. \nThey also discussed \"the uptick in violence in eastern Ukraine\". \nAs for Russia, NATO chief talked about NATO's policy of strong defense and dialogue with Russia during the conversation. \nThe two leaders will discuss related issues at the upcoming NATO Summit in Brussels in late May, according to the statement. \nIt was Stoltenberg's second phone conversation with Trump since his election, after the first phone call last November. \nTrump's comments over NATO had caused concern across the alliance. \nIn a recent interview, Trump said NATO was \"obsolete because it was not taking care of terror\", and he complained that various members of the bloc were not paying their dues, which was \"very unfair to the United States\". \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:11:50.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
