Clive Lewis quits shadow cabinet as article 50 bill clears House of Commons - as it happened Read more \nThe reduction of the discussion to a “Brexit means Brexit” level, allied with the foaming of the rightwing press, has not just meant that the energies of parliament are directed to achieve a minimum participation. It has also meant that British communities and their individual members have been effectively excluded. Which is an incredible thing. \nWhy has the government not – and those who were on the leave campaign in particular – created a “great conversation” in the country, asking citizens what kind of society they want after Brexit? Here is a huge opportunity for change but what should it mean for our small towns, our city transport systems, the environment? \nWhat about the education and training we’ll need to operate in a different exporting world? What about those abandoned areas of which leave made so much – how do they want to live and work post-Brexit? And how much are we losing by not letting the British people have a bigger say in what comes next? \nThe one thing we can all agree on, post-referendum, is that people wanted at least a sense of influencing their own destiny – which again, they are being denied. \nSo we at the New Weather Institute decided to do just that. We organised an event at Blackbird Leys , a large estate on the outer perimeter of Oxford. This is a big leave area compared with the 83% of the rest of Oxford that voted remain. We advertised on leaflets, posters and emails, asking “It’s a new world – what do we want from it?”. We went round pubs, the local car plant, kebab shops and newsagents; we gave out flyers on pavements at the shopping centre and outside the leisure centre. Corbyn defends Labour’s Brexit stance after Lewis resigns – video \nMore than 30 people turned up on a cold winter evening at the end of 2016: different ethnicities, young and old, workers and some sixth-formers from the Oxford Academy. We did not touch on how anyone voted, though it was clear many of the participants had voted to remain, which raised the thought that the branding of areas as remain or leave is unnecessarily divisive. We had a vague agenda of housing, employment and the environment, but that quickly went out the window as four tables fell to discussing everything about life on Blackbird Leys and how it must be bettered after Brexit. \nThere were a number of major preoccupations, and three key points emerged. One was the concern that there was nowhere to talk freely about aspects of life and work without fear of division. Blackbird Leys was built round the huge Cowley car works, where jobs have gone by the thousands in the last 15 years. The disappearance of such work and its replacement by zero-hour contracts work meant that there was no regular centre for many. \nPeople had a strong sense that their children were being educated wrongly. They perceived that, owing to a lack of time in the classroom (all spent on the core curriculum), children are “kept actively ignorant”. Long-term investment in education is needed – but by whom? \nBritain has never invested enough in its own economy, or in the people driving that economy. At the moment, UK inventors and entrepreneurs are not capable of realising their ideas at home, so need to go outward and develop and bring their innovations to the market in different countries. Much more inward investment is needed. But as ever, the question was how to get this done. \nThe strongest message from the meeting was that people knew they were not being listened to. They are the future, and it is being decided without them. But their ideas and commitment are so strong that the government is mad to ignore them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T17:38:28.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
