Reckitt Benckiser spokeswoman Suzanne Grogan said the relocation of its warehouse and custom manufacturing operation, which supports product embellishment and repackaging, to St. Peters will be complete by July 1. Reckitt Benckiser is leasing a $31.5 million, 715,000-square-foot facility from Duke Realty. Grogan said approximately 350 contract workers, or those employed by a third-party logistics company, also will work out of the site. The maker of French’s mustard and Frank’s RedHot hot sauce is hiring 10 full-time… more Mike Mozart The French’s Food Co. plant, which employs about 300, is not closing, and all production there will be unaffected by the relocation, Grogan said. Cattleman’s barbecue sauce and French’s French Fried Onions also are manufactured in Springfield. The state of Missouri received a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification from Reckitt Benckiser on Jan. 31. The WARN notice posted on the Department of Economic Development website had the number of layoffs at 456, not 140. The DED’s director of communications, Amy Susan , said the error was due to “confusing and misleading information provided by the company” in which Reckitt Benckiser gave a list of 456 positions that are potentially subject to be laid off. Grogan attributed the miscalculation to the state. By Wednesday afternoon, the WARN notice had been corrected, with 140 layoffs. Reckitt Benckiser also operates a warehouse at Arrowhead Industrial Park in St. Peters. About 260 people are employed there, plus about 350 contractors. Grogan said the company is “actively looking to hire” 50 more employees at its Arrow facility. Reckitt Benckiser Inc., a subsidiary of U.K.-based Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, owns the French’s and Frank’s brands that are manufactured in Springfield, located at 4455 E. Mustard Way. Reckitt’s food segment had net revenue of 349 million euros, or $379.2 million, in 2015, according to the company’s most recent annual report. That was up 1 percent from 2014. Reckitt Benckiser Inc. also owns such household cleaning supplies as Lysol, Easy-Off and Air Wick. The company is reportedly in talks to buy Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.7 billion, according to Reuters.
