With Prime Minister Justin Trudeau set to have his first tete-a-tete with the president on Monday, political Ottawa has been working at full tilt all week to make sure the visit to Washington does more good than harm. \nREAD MORE: Justin Trudeau expected to push for open border in Donald Trump meeting \nEven as three of Trudeau’s most powerful cabinet ministers trekked to Washington to till the soil for Monday’s visit, there were developments here in Canada that will touch everyday lives — on opioid addiction, on Arctic sovereignty and on government subsidies for Canadian companies. \nHere’s how politics touched us this week: Addiction \nAfter years of political wrangling, the federal government has announced approval for three safe-injection sites for drug addicts. \nAll three of them will be in Montreal, but there are 10 others waiting for government approval for Toronto, Vancouver, Surrey, B.C., Victoria, Ottawa and another in Montreal. There are already two in operation in Vancouver. \nREAD MORE: Alternative treatments needed to curb Canada’s reliance on opioids: experts \nAt the same time, the federal Liberals and the NDP are working together to amend legislation in order to make it easier to open up new supervised sites. \nThe sites are a key part of the federal government’s nascent approach to dealing with an alarming escalating of drug abuse and deaths linked to opioids. The RCMP is working with China to curb the flow of opioids into Canada. And the government says it is building a fuller strategy set to be rolled out soon. \nWATCH: New data suggests Alberta opioid crisis is worsening The Arctic \nTrudeau made his first prime ministerial trip to the Arctic this week, accompanied by his social development minister, his indigenous affairs minister and his health minister. \nWhile the Liberals have not really set out a full-fledged Arctic policy, there are hints emerging about the federal government’s approach. In the long-running debate about whether sovereignty in the Arctic is best established through military presence or socio-economic development, Trudeau’s entourage suggests he favours the latter approach — although any government would officially say both approaches are required. \nREAD MORE: Trudeau meets with Inuit leaders during first visit to Arctic as PM \n(Former prime minister Stephen Harper made a habit of visiting the Arctic once a year, his trips often coinciding with military exercises and shows of strength.) \nNorthern populations, especially indigenous peoples, face high rates of poor health and poverty, and are also on the front lines of global warming — climate changes that are having direct effects on lifestyle and development. \nIn Iqaluit, the ministers promised to make amends for how tuberculosis victims of the past were treated, and said they would focus on education and community development. They also committed to regular meetings with Inuit officials to address health, suicide prevention, housing shortages and persistent problems with TB. \nWATCH: Trudeau answers questions during his trip to the Arctic Justin Trudeau discusses indigenous education and success of students ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T19:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T14:58:36.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
