(Spears did not contribute to the film “in any way, shape, or form… nor does it have her blessing,” her rep told EW in August.) \nMany fans shared their dismay over the unauthorized portrayal of Spears’ life on Twitter, but at least Corden had some fun. “I’m flipping through the channels and it’s like, ‘Pops!… I did it again,'” he said of the film, which stars Australian newcomer Natasha Bassett as Spears. “It’s toxic. It drives me crazy because I just want Lifetime to gimme, gimme more, gimme more.” \nTaking a moment to comment on the lead actress, Corden stated that she’s the “perfect person for a biopic if the biopic was about Tiffany Trump.” He went on to note that Bassett nailed all of Britney’s signature characteristics, including her passion for cheesy snacks. “It’s like you’re watching a documentary,” he said of one scene. “In a world full of fake news, I’m just happy to have some truth. And that truth, ladies and gentlemen, is that Britney Spears loves cheese puffs.” \nHe also joked about the movie’s budget. “They spent so much money on writers and actors, it appears like they ran out of money for getting the rights to Britney Spears’ music,” said Corden. “Luckily, the creative masterminds behind the film came up with some Britney songs even Britney didn’t know existed.” \nThat’s when he cut to clips of Bassett singing and dancing to songs that aren’t actually Spears hits. First up there’s “If You’re Looking for Trouble.” “It’s amazing for someone to make a song so forgettable, I couldn’t sing it to you now,” he said, “and I heard it four seconds ago.” Then there’s “Alright, Alright,” which left Corden laughing. \nRELATED: Hear more of the latest TV news from this week \nNext up in the analysis was the casting of Nathan Keyes as Spears’ ex-boyfriend, Justin Timberlake . “The Lifetime version of Justin Timberlake maybe didn’t look like him, but if you close your eyes, it’s like he’s in the room,” said Corden, laughing and shaking his head before mocking Keyes’ more cringeworthy lines. “You know it’s Timberlake when you hear ‘bomb diggity.'” \nBut Corden did seem to enjoy a scene showing the pop duo expressing their post-breakup angst in the most “poignant and mature way ever”: a dance-off. “We cut seven minutes out of that dance-off. That’s how long it is, and it’s still hard to say who won,” Corden quipped. “I know who won — anyone who watched it.” \nDespite faulting the film, the comedian couldn’t help but admit the movie ended in an inspiring way. “In these troubled times of conflict, the show ended with a powerful message,” he said, rolling a clip of Bassett’s Britney declaring that “we all deserve to be happy.” \nCorden was certainly happy with his Saturday night.
