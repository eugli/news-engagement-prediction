who should never have been paid £1 million compensation by the Government \"on merit\", Tony Blair's former counter-terrorism adviser has said.\nLord Carlile , who served as the Government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation from 2001 to 2011, said the former Guantanamo Bay detainee should not have been given a \"penny\" because \"plainly he was a terrorist\".\nJamal al-Harith, a Muslim convert born Ronald Fiddler who detonated a car bomb at an Iraqi army base near Mosul, was released from the US detention camp in 2004 and successfully claimed compensation after saying British agents knew or were complicit in his mistreatment.\nHe was freed following intense lobbying by Tony Blair’s Labour government.\nThere was absolutely no merit in paying him a penny because plainly he was a terrorist Lord Carlile L ord Carlile said there was \"an anomaly\" between the United Kingdom and the Unites States, where Al-Harith had failed to claim similar compensation.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"My belief is the settlement was paid to avoid disclosure being in court of the activities and files of the security services.\n\"The government was quite right not to want to disclose those files, but plainly there is an anomaly between the United Kingdom, where the threat of disclosure of such files led to the payment of compensation, and the United States, where this man brought a legal action which failed.\n\"It should never have been paid on the merits. There was absolutely no merit in paying him a penny because plainly he was a terrorist and he was a potentially dangerous terrorist.\n\"The issue was the legal disclosure rules. If someone brings a civil action for damages they are entitled to disclosure of material, some of which may be national security material.\"\n\"In my view the UK government and its legal advisers were absolutely right not to disclose, to an enemy of the state, clear national security material. \n\"But there is an issue as to why the UK government paid money, but not the US government, which has much stricter rules about disclosure of national security material.\"\nLord Carlile served as the Government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation under Tony Blair Credit: Abbie Trayler-Smith E arlier this week, Isil named al-Harith as the man who had blown himself up in the car bombing at the Iraqi army base, and released a picture of him.\nAl-Harith’s wife Shukee Begum travelled to Syria with their five children to try to persuade her husband to return to the UK, but failed and was taken hostage before eventually managing to escape.\nAl-Harith, the son of Jamaican immigrants, converted to Islam in the 1990s and worked as a web designer before he travelled to the Pakistani city of Quetta in 2001 for what he claimed was a religious holiday.\nJamal al-Harith, born Ronald Fiddler, converted to Islam in the 1990s Credit: BANARAS KHAN/EPA H e has insisted he tried to enter Iran when the US invaded neighbouring Afghanistan, but was captured and imprisoned by the Taliban on suspicion of being a UK spy.\nWhen US special forces found him in a Taliban jail, they assessed him as a “high threat to the US” who was “probably involved in a former terrorist attack against the US”.\nAl-Harith’s prisoner file from Guantanamo Bay, published online by WikiLeaks, refers to him travelling to Sudan in 1992 with “Abu Bakr, a well-known al-Qaeda operative”.\nJamal al-Harith leaves Northolt RAF base in March 2004 after being released from Guantanamo Bay Credit: AFP/Getty A fter his return to the UK - where he was released without charge - he joined three other former prisoners known as the Tipton Three in a failed attempt to sue Donald Rumsfeld, the then US Defense Secretary.\nHis legal action against the British government was more successful, resulting in a payment of up to £1 million in return for which he agreed not to talk about his ordeal.\nJamal al-Harith MPs attack 'scandalous' decision to award al-Harith £1 million T im Loughton , a Conservative MP reportedly said: \"This is a scandalous situation. So much for Tony Blair’s assurances that this extremist did not pose a security threat.\n\"He clearly was a risk to Britain and our security all along. It adds insult to injury that he was given £1million in compensation because of Blair’s flawed judgement that he was an innocent.\"\nJohn Pugh , a Lib Dem MP, said: \"This raises serious questions about the reassurances Labour gave us that this man posed no danger. \n\"It is a kick in the teeth that he was given a fortune in taxpayers’ money after claiming he was innocent only to flee to Islamic State and pose a risk to the UK.\n\"The Home Office needs to explain how he was able to leave the country so easily despite his background mixing with those at the very top of Islamic terrorism.\"\nBritons fighting with jihadis in Middle East As many as 850 people regarded as a national security concern have travelled to fight with jihadis in the Middle East.\nJust under half are thought to have returned to Britain while 15 per cent are believed to have been killed.\nThe Foreign Office states:\nThe UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, and against all travel to large parts of Iraq.\nAs all UK consular services are suspended in Syria and greatly limited in Iraq, it is extremely difficult to confirm the whereabouts and status of British nationals in these areas.\nThe other 4 key British jihadis known to have died fighting for Isil 1. Mohammed Emwazi / Jihadi John Emwazi was reported killed in a November 2015 air strike, with US forces saying they were \"reasonably certain\" he was dead.\nIsil later released what appeared to be an obituary to the fighter, who it called Abu Muharib al-Muhajir.\nIt featured a smiling picture of the militant, who appeared unmasked looking towards the ground.\nMohammed Enwazi E mwazi shocked the world when he appeared in a video in August 2014 in which he condemned the West and appeared to behead US journalist James Foley.\nHe emerged again in a number of other videos released by Isil, including those in which American reporter Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning were murdered.\nKuwait-born Emwazi attended Quintin Kynaston Community Academy in north London and was described by his former head teacher as a \"hard-working aspirational young man\".\nHe went on to gain a degree in information systems with business management from the University of Westminster.\n2. Reyaad Khan Khan was 20 when he appeared in an Isil propaganda video titled, There Is No Life Without Jihad, in June last year together with two other Britons urging Westerners to join the war.\nThe man, from Cardiff, is thought to have travelled to fight in Syria late in 2013.\nHis Facebook page revealed that he was a Chelsea FC fan who enjoyed playing computer games FIFA 12 and Call Of Duty.\nAfter appearing in the video with a Kalashnikov assault rifle against his shoulder his mother said she believed he had been \"brainwashed\" into joining Isil.\nReyaad Khan and Ruhul Amin I n a direct appeal to her son, the woman, who asked to remain unnamed, sobbed as she said: \"Reyaad, please come back home. I'm dying for you. You're my only son.\"\nBefore leaving for Syria, Khan attended Cardiff's Al-Manar Centre (ACT) together with Nasser Muthana, who was also filmed for the Isil recruitment video.\nThe mosque denied the pair had been taught extremist views there and blamed the internet as an \"alarming source for radicalisation\".\nDavid Cameron, the then Prime Minister, said Khan had been killed on August 21 2015 when he was targeted by an RAF remotely piloted aircraft while travelling in a vehicle in Raqqah, Syria.\n3. Ruhul Amin Amin, 26, featured alongside Khan and Muthana in the 13-minute Isil recruitment video under the name Brother Abu Bara al Hindi.\nWearing sunglasses and a white headscarf, he could be heard saying: \"Are you willing to sacrifice the fat job you've got, the big car, the family you have?\n\"Are you willing to sacrifice this, for the sake of Allah? If you do Allah will give you back 700 times more.\"\nAlso known as Abdul Raqib Amin, he was born in Bangladesh and grew up in Aberdeen before reportedly moving with his family to Leicester.\nAmin I n July 2014 he boasted on ITV's Good Morning Britain that he had been \"involved in a few combats\" in Syria.\nExplaining the moment he left Britain, he said: \"I left the house with the intention of not to go back. I'm going to stay and fight until the (caliphate) is established, or I die.\"\nA leading member of Aberdeen's Muslim community, who did not want to be identified, said he was not someone who \"stood out in any particular way\".\nHe was killed in the same airstrike as Khan.\n4. Junaid Hussain Computer hacker Hussain was described as a key Isil operative before he was killed by a US drone strike on August 24 2016.\nThe 21-year-old, from Birmingham, was said to have been number three on the Pentagon's \"kill list\" of Isil targets.\nIt is believed that he fled Britain to travel to Syria in 2013, and in June last year he was linked to a plot to attack an Armed Forces Day parade in south London.\nJunaid Hussain T he plan to explode a pressure cooker bomb - killing soldiers and bystanders on the route - was reportedly foiled after Hussain unwittingly recruited an undercover investigator from The Sun to carry it out.\nIn June 2012, aged 18, Hussain was jailed for six months after he admitted making prank calls to a counter-terror hotline and publishing former prime minister Tony Blair's address book.\nHe was a member of TeaMpOisoN (TeamPoison), a group which claimed responsibility for more than 1,400 offences where personal and private information has been illegally extracted from victims in the UK and around the world.\nHussain was reportedly married to a Muslim convert named as Sally Jones, a mother-of-two from Kent who once was a member of an all-girl punk rock group.\nThe emergence of Isil", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:34:56.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
