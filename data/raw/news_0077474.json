Mercedes Fortune, a Phoenix police spokeswoman.\nThe child was taken to Phoenix Children's Hospital by his mother, court documents said.\nRuben Sandoval   (Photo: Maricopa County Sheriff's Office) \nPerla Denise Sierra Duarte   (Photo: Maricopa County Sheriff's Office) \nThe boy's mother returned to the day care after taking her son for treatment and asked to see video of the room at the time of the accident. She was told she could not see the video. According to court documents released Friday, the day-care director gave the mother a letter from the school stating that the child had \"tripped over a toy and bumped his head on a table.\"\nThe day-care director, Duarte, also told Adams to sign a resignation later and \"not to talk to anyone about this, including the police,\" according to court documents.\nOfficers were called to the day care on 7227 S. Central Ave. at about 8:20 a.m. Feb. 17 to investigate the report of an injured child, police said.\nAccording to Adams, she was cleaning up cereal that a group of 1- to 2-year-olds who were in the play area had spilled. Adams told officers the boy had crawled under a table where she was sweeping, and she asked him to move twice.\nWhen he wouldn't move, Adams hit him, but told police \"she did not believe she hit him that hard,\" court documents said.\nAdams was booked on suspicion of one count of reckless child abuse, a Class 3 felony. She was released on her own recognizance. Her next court appearance was scheduled for March 9.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:43:37.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
