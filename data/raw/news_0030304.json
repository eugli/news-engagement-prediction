Cuban tweeted \"LOL\" and what appeared to be a private exchange between himself and Trump, in which the tech wizard offered advice to then-candidate Trump. \nThe note also included a hand-written response from Trump, effectively brushing off Cuban's advice. \nBut, then, Cuban's and Trump's Twitter followers got in on the act. \nMultiple tweets criticized Trump for spending his time attacking Cuban when there were other, more important things going on in the world. Photo: Twitter \nSource: Twitter \nSource: Twitter \nA few even wondered what prompted the attack to begin with. Was it an attempt by Trump to draw attention away from North Korea? \nOr an insomniac president letting his fingers (and mind) do the walking and talking at 5 a.m.? \nTrump never responded to Cuban or the others, so there's no good way of knowing.
