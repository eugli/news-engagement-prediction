Most Popular By Michael Arceneaux Feb 26, 2017 In the past few months, the court jester of white nationalism was elected president over a much more qualified and deserving candidate, Tom Brady collected yet another Super Bowl ring, and 25 won over Lemonade for Album of the Year at the 59th annual Grammy Awards. It has been nothing but one reminder after another that being the best doesn't translate to getting what you deserve, that cheaters do in fact prosper, and most of all, that whiteness trumps all. Perhaps somehow, someway, Moonlight will manage to skirt past La La Land and win Best Picture at the looming Academy Awards, but I won't hold my breath, and neither should anyone else.

Halle Berry became the first Black actor to win Best Actress in 2002 for her role in Monster's Ball yet she struggled for years to get many of her projects in development to actually get made and released . It should not have been this way, but that is the way of Hollywood. \nIt has been nothing but one reminder after another that being the best doesn't translate to getting what you deserve Most Popular To that end, I want to celebrate Moonlight for what it has proven, with or without specific recognition from the Academy. For one, an arthouse film centering Black male sexuality and masculinity in a nuanced, complicated way, and broken into three parts without any huge resolution or moralizing has made more than $22 million in fewer than 1200 theaters . That is quite the accomplishment for a film budgeted at $1.5 million . The same can be said of its international gross, which Deadline notes could be as much as $40 million worldwide, an unusual achievement for a serious film without A-lister star clout. All too often, Black filmmakers are told that their works have limited appeal outside of America. Black people can walk on nearly any part of this world and see our cultural impact, yet somehow, we are to believe that we cannot sell our stories abroad. For any Black film to annihilate such asininity with its demonstrated success is something to be celebrated, especially when it depicts a minority within a minority. Moonlight is beautiful for many reasons, but what makes it most stunning is that it adds layers to characters we often only see as caricatures.

When I read English critic Camilla Long's much maligned Sunday Times review of the film, I didn't initially give a solitary damn about anything she had to say. Everything ain't for everybody—and anyone who launches a Moonlight review by describing the film as \"a film about gay love in the black ghetto\" probably shouldn't have bothered. Other writers have thoroughly and intelligently tackled Long's review , but I will say there is one aspect of Long's piece that particularly rankles when considering Moonlight as we depart awards season. In her review, Long took issue with Moonlight 's narrative, calling it not \"particularly 'urgent'\" and adding that \"the story has been told countless times, against countless backdrops.\" She is correct in that the kinds of Black-focused works that are praised in mainstream culture—and particularly by the Academy—are often of a similar kind, told within the constraints of pathology. Amongst the #OscarSoWhite criticism that buzzed after last year's Oscar nominations were announced, Brandon K. Thorp wrote a piece called \"What Does the Academy Value in a Black Performance?\" In it, he noted: \"In the history of the Oscars, 10 black women have been nominated for best actress, and nine of them played characters who are homeless or might soon become so. (The exception is Viola Davis, for the 2011 drama The Help .)\" Related Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:54:38.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
