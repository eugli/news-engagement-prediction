And from there, students gain confidence in their skills and their lives. \nThe academy instructs students as young as 2 through adulthood; they have students in their 60s. The school’s goal is to help students at every age stay physically fit and grow mentally. For “Little Ninjas,” this means learning social skills and boundaries. Older children might explore self-defense, anti-bullying and core values that will help them succeed as adults. Even the oldest students take away important lessons about discipline and confidence. \nBut studying there is not all work and no play. “We view our school as a place where students can come and learn, have fun, make friends with people from all walks of life,” says Chang. -- Kit Waskom Pollard | For Harford Magazine \n109A North Main St., Bel Air1301 E.
