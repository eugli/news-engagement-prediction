According to AS (h/t CalcioMercato ), the coach is keen to lead Atletico away from the Vicente Calderon and into their new home, the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium, which is set to open in 2017-18. It's suggested in the report that Simeone and the club's sporting director Andrea Berta have already started discussing possible transfer targets for the summer. Atletico are set to leave the Calderon at the end of the campaign. Denis Doyle/Getty Images As noted in the piece, the Argentinian has been tipped as a possible option for Arsenal should Arsene Wenger depart the club when his contract is up at the end of the season. The two Serie A sides are also noted as big admirers of the Atletico man. Indeed, since joining the capital club in 2011, the man known as El Cholo has cemented his status as one of the best managers in the game. As noted by Sky Sports Statto, Sunday's match with Barcelona was a landmark one for Simeone, and an ideal time to reflect on his excellent record at Atletico: Sky Sports Statto @SkySportsStatto Diego Simeone takes charge of his 300th game for Atletico Madrid (W189), Luis Enrique takes charge of 100th #laliga game for Barcelona (W74) https://t.co/o8e5wWf5MI 2/26/2017, 2:53:42 PM The manager's time at the helm has been one of the most successful in Atletico's history, starting with a UEFA Europa League win in his first season. Since then, Simeone steered his side to a Copa del Rey win in 2012-13 and most memorably, a shock La Liga title in 2013-14, beating Barcelona and rivals Real Madrid to top spot. Atletico have come up just short in pursuit of the UEFA Champions League under Simeone on two occasions, losing to their city rivals in the final in 2014 and 2016. Simeone has enjoyed plenty of success at Atletico. Michael Regan/Getty Images Under the guidance of Simeone, plenty of footballers have taken their game onto a higher level, too, including the club's current star man Antoine Griezmann, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United . Per MisterChip, the forward is now among the most effective attackers in the division: MisterChip (English) @MisterChiping Goals+Assists this season on Spanish football [45] Messi [37] Luis Su√°rez [30] Cristiano [27] Griezmann [25] Neymar [23] @aspas10 2/26/2017, 7:13:35 PM This season Atletico are out of the title race and face a huge battle to finish in the top-four spots, with Real Sociedad , in fifth, just a point behind them. However, in the Champions League, after a 4-2 away win over Bayer Leverkusen in the first leg of their last-16 tie, they are well placed to progress to the quarter-finals. Having helped the club progress so much in recent seasons, it'd be fitting if Simeone, an enormous figure in Atletico's history as a player and a boss, remained the team's custodian as they begin a new era at a new home.
