But now, a first-of-its-kind study released here today claims that including almonds in the diet may significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases in Indians with type 2 diabetes and also improve their general health. \nAlmond consumption as part of a healthy diet may help improve glycemic and cardiovascular measures and lead to better health in type 2 diabetes patients, researchers said. \n“India is known as the diabetes capital of the world, with incidence of type 2 diabetes currently reaching epidemic proportions,” researchers wrote in the study published in the journal Metabolic Syndrome and Related Disorders. \nOnce deemed a disease of the affluent, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes now cuts across all social, demographic and age groups, they said. They attribute this higher and earlier incidence of type 2 diabetes in part to the “South Asian phenotype,” a genetic predisposition that makes Indians more susceptible to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

We now have confidence in prescribing it to all patients as mid-meal healthy snacks,” Misra added.

During a three-week run-in period, participants ate a standard diet compliant with the dietary guidelines for Asian Indians and appropriate for diabetes. \nDuring this period, participants were also asked to walk for 45 minutes at least five days a week to standardise their physical activity and were instructed to maintain the same level of activity for the rest of the study. \nThere were 50 participants who completed the study commissioned by the Almond Board of California in collaboration with DFI. \nFollow @htlifeandstyle for more.
