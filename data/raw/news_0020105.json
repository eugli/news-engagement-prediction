And I think that’s unfortunate for people that look to news institutions like that for their news.”\nRELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack\nSpicer’s boss also dismissed the New York Times article as “total fiction” in a tweet on Monday.\nThe failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017\n“The failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me,” he wrote. “They have gotten it wrong for two years, and now are making up stories & sources!”\nEarlier in the day, the president alerted his 24 million followers that “any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election.”\nAny negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election.
