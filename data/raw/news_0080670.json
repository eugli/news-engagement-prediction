Dev Patel lost the coveted trophy to Mahershala Ali of Moonlight! Everyone has been talking about the Academy Awards happening right now. It is a big dan deal ever since we found out that Dev Patel has been nominated for the Best Supporting Actor category for his act in Lion. Patel’s film became the most talked about in the industry. But sadly at the awards night, he lost the trophy to Moonlight’s Mahershala Ali. If you’ve seen the Barry Jenkins movie, you’d be convinced why he rightfully received this award. The man’s performance was exemplary! Just as we had predicted the Oscar win, looks like it has been exactly what we speculated it to be! Ali did take home the award. For us, the best part of his performance was the scene in the movie where he baptises the young boy in the water. That totally stole the show! \nALSO READ – Oscars 2017 red carpet: Lion duo Dev Patel and Sunny Pawar suit up for the big night \nSince Patel did win the BAFTA for Best Supporting Actor, there were high hopes that he will take home the Oscar trophy as well. But looks like they had other plans. The category also included, Jeff Bridges for Hell or High Water, Lucas Hedges for Manchester By The Sea and Michael Shannon for Nocturnal Animals. While they all were phenomenal performances, even for us, Mahershala stood out. While the Oscar for Supporting Actor has been taken by Moonlight, perhaps the Best Supporting Actress will be awarded to Nicole Kidman for Lion? We’ll have to wait and watch about that as she has some really tough competition in the form of Viola Davis. \nALSO READ – Priyanka Chopra at Oscars 2017: Desi girl dons a futuristic Ralph and Russo gown at the red carpet \nAnyway, for the big night, the Lion actor attended along with his mother.
