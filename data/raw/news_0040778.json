Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Phoenix Suns 110-91. (Photo: Justin Ford-USA TODAY Sports) \nMemphis Grizzlies digital content reporter Alexis Morgan decided to ask fans at All-Star weekend in New Orleans about whether or not they're excited to see Zach Randolph in the Dunk Contest on Saturday. \nThe thing is, Randolph isn't in the Dunk Contest. He's actually not even involved in All-Star weekend. The Grizzlies' Marc Gasol is the one who'll represent the team in the All-Star Game. \nSome of these fans are going to be very disappointed when they find out. People are PUMPED to see Zach Randolph in tonight's Slam Dunk Contest! #NBAAllStar #VoteZBO pic.twitter.com/b28ADSNXoV â€” Memphis Grizzlies (@memgrizz) February 18, 2017 \nA few of them say they don't think Randolph has a chance, but some of them say that they're pumped and would like to see him get an unlikely win. \nHopefully Randolph is shown this video soon. Surely he'd get a kick out of it.
