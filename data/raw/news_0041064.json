In this case, when they removed the form we have a cantilevering effect of that wall.” \nWhen asked how the slab become unstable, Baxter replied, “That will be under investigation. We are in the process of determining how we will be able to mitigate and secure this.” \nBaxter said that everyone but essential members of the construction crew have been evacuated from 41 Tehama, but that all other nearby buildings were being completely cleared. \n“We have been aggressively evacuating buildings to make sure we don’t have any injuries,” said Baxter. “If it does fall, the worst case scenario is that we would have structural damage to one or two buildings below.” \nThis is a multi-hour event. They are awaiting the arrival of structural engineers \nThe project at 41 Tehama St. is a 37-story, 403-unit luxury residential tower near the Transbay Transit Center site. It began construction in 2015, according to a 2015 statement from development and construction management firm Lend Lease. \nKPIX 5 reporter Andria Borba said that the street closures in the area were snarling traffic as commuters started heading for the Bay Bridge on-ramp at 1st Street and Harrison.
