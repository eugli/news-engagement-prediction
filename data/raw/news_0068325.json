Amy Nicole Graves, 43, was arrested yesterday afternoon on a charge of having unnatural intercourse with a dog. Lamar County Sheriff's deputies received a tip that led them to an online video, allegedly showing the act. 'We got some visual documentation off social media that led to a search warrant and arrest warrant,' Sheriff Danny Rigel said. It is thought that the act occurred sometime within the last year. Rigel says that this is not the first such case he has seen, but that they are 'very rare'. Graves was booked in Lamar County Jail Tuesday night and is awaiting her first court appearance. If convicted, she faces the possibility of up to 10 years in prison and would need to register as a sex offender.
