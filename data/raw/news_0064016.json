shook his head to the contrary, to indicate the back of the house. One of the president’s men came towards the gate around 5:07 p.m, beckoning to the reporter to “come.” He then asked: “Are you interested in your president dying?” When the reporter said; “no and that is why we are here to seek the truth,\" the president's aide then said: \"If you want your president dead, you will be disappointed. The president is hale and hearty. He will be returning soon.” The aide was said to have rained abuse on the reporter before walking back inside. Meanwhile, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has urged Christians to continue praying for President Muhammadu Buhari until he returns to the country hale and hearty.
