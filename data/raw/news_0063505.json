MIF is involved in the response of brain cells called glia to the build-up of abnormal proteins in the brain during Alzheimer's disease. It is believed inhibition and reduction of MIF activity caused by glycation could be the 'tipping point' in disease progression. It appears that as Alzheimer's progresses, glycation of these enzymes increases. Professor Jean van den Elsen, from Bath's Department of Biology and Biochemistry, said: 'We've shown that this enzyme is already modified by glucose in the brains of individuals at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. 'We are now investigating if we can detect similar changes in blood. Alzheimer's disease is yet another reason that we should be controlling our sugar intake in our diets Dr Omar Kassaar, University of Bath 'Normally MIF would be part of the immune response to the build-up of abnormal proteins in the brain, and we think that because sugar damage reduces some MIF functions and completely inhibits others that this could be a tipping point that allows Alzheimer's to develop.' Dr Rob Williams, also from the Department of Biology and Biochemistry, added: 'Knowing this will be vital to developing a chronology of how Alzheimer's progresses and we hope will help us identify those at risk of Alzheimer's and lead to new treatments or ways to prevent the disease. Dr Clare Walton, Research Manager at Alzheimer's Society said: 'We know that diabetes can double a person's risk of developing dementia but we still don't really understand how the two conditions are linked - this study offers a vital clue. 'The researchers have found a specific effect of high blood glucose on an enzyme in the brains of people with Alzheimer's, providing a plausible biological mechanism connecting the two conditions. 'With diabetes on the rise, a better understanding of how it affects brain cells can help us to find ways to help people with diabetes manage their risk of dementia. 'Alzheimer's Society is currently funding a clinical trial to see whether a diabetes drug can be used as a dementia treatment.'
