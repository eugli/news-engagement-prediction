The pro-Brussels Confederation of British Industry called for Britain to join the euro and warned leaving the EU would be a disaster for the economy. Although the British Chambers of Commerce officially took a neutral stance in the referendum campaign, former director general John Longworth left abruptly early last year after personally backing Brexit publicly. Mr Longworth, who is now co-chairman of Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave, said the decision to appoint a ‘leaver’ as head of the IoD was ‘very sensible’. Although the British Chambers of Commerce officially took a neutral stance in the referendum campaign, former director general John Longworth left after backing Brexit publicly He added: ‘If the IoD is embracing Brexit, and looking to find the best way of making Britain a great place to do business, then that is to be applauded. I would hope that other business organisations follow suit.’ Mr Martin, 51, a married father of two, grew up in a working-class Belfast home when the sectarian violence of The Troubles was at its peak. He took a degree in quantity surveying at Ulster University and has an MBA from London Business School. The former Territorial Army recruit is also a bona fide magician. ‘People are often surprised when they find out I’m a member of The Magic Circle,’ he said. ‘I joined the Ulster society of magicians in the 80s and met all the top magicians of the day, including Paul Daniels. I used to do weekend shows and children’s parties to earn a bit of extra cash.’ Striking an upbeat tone about Britain’s future outside the EU, Mr Martin said: ‘Rather than closing doors, Brexit could open our eyes to the rest of the world. We may have previously ignored trading partners because we haven’t needed to go there. ‘There are massive opportunities around the world, particularly if the Prime Minister follows through on her promise to be a champion of free trade.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:14:57.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
