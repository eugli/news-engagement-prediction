But so many people let the side down by simply not 'getting it' when it comes to modern levels of acceptability and expectation. Here are some ways that people let themselves down when it comes to using their gizmos, gadgets and social media. Tuning out William says it can be upsetting for others when you choose to engage with your phone rather than them When a friend or loved one wants to show you something on television or play you a track, they probably mean for you to engage in the experience rather than focus on your phone or tablet. It's distracting and a little upsetting for them to then find you flicking through your feeds or inbox rather than giving your full attention. If you're not that interested or want to watch or do something else, say so. Do one thing properly, not two things half-heartedly. Relationship milestones 'Less is very much more when it comes to sharing such matters' Social media has bred this false belief that all your 'friends' and followers care about every moment in your life. What we used to just communicate to a select few now gets broadcast to hundreds. That it's 67 days until your wedding or your three-and-a-half-month anniversary of relationship bliss is not an update that anyone cares about. Even your partner may struggle to muster enthusiasm for such a menial milestone. Less is very much more when it comes to sharing such matters. Shameless posting about your business William says people should stop posting about business because it's 'shameless' Listen, we've connected with you on Facebook because we like you as a person and are keenly interested in you socially. QED: we are your friends, not your clients. Using your social page to promote a new pyramid scheme ('it's not a pyramid scheme!') is shameless and unwanted. Fine - post one missive inviting your friends to like your business page, but do not blur the boundaries and use your friends to shift your gear using your personal account. Food photography Photos of food is a common pet peeve but still seems to be incredibly popular online Years ago, people said grace before they ate. Today, they take photos of their food. Then they have a discussion as to which filter best sets off the scones, and then they wonder why the scones have gone tepid. Just eat them. A weighty issue William insists that it still counts as going to the gym even if you don't tell anyone about it I'm no fitness expert, but surely you should be using all your energy in the gym to actually workout, rather than use it to share with us the size of your muscles, or lack of hips, as an Instagram story? Think how buff you could be if you used the time and energy to lift that 24kg weight rather than stage a photoshoot of it. It still counts as going to the gym even if no one else knows about it but you. Adding friends you don't know 'All generations need to get some perspective, but a good rule of thumb is to never add anyone you haven't met in real life' Older generations, who came late to the Facebook party, do have a tendency to add people they know of, but have never actually met. Younger generations, who grew up thinking that a friend request from someone was a big deal, can find this a tad alarming; borderline intrusive. All generations need to get some perspective, but a good rule of thumb is to never add anyone you haven't met in real life. Taking selfies in mirrors The 'lonely' mirror selfie is a big no-no in William's book Nothing silently shrieks loneliness more than posting a photo of you taken with a phone in your mirror. I do pity you, but resist sharing it. Ask a friend (you must have at least one) to take a photo of you rather than DIY.
