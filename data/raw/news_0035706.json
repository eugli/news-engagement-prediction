'They have a genetic disorder, myotonia congenita, that causes their muscles to stiffen for a few seconds when excited or panicked,' he said. 'They don't actually lose consciousness and they tend to faint less when they get older, because they learn to spread their legs and balance. Owner David Taneyhill, from Ohio, filmed Ricky and his sibling Lucy jumping on a garden swing, but it proved too much for Ricky who fainted and fell off Both Lucy (left) and Ricky (right) have the condition but Lucy has only fainted two or three times while Ricky faints a couple times a week 'Our tan goat Lucy has only fainted two or three times since we got her but Ricky faints a couple times a week.' Mr Taneyhil, who lives in Cleveland, added: 'It definitely worried us the first few times, but you start to realise that it doesn't hurt them. They just get up and shake it off. 'It is still scary when they faint off something they jumped on, but then again Ricky hasn't learned his lesson about jumping on the swing, so it can't hurt that badly.'
