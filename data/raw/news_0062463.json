Woman killed as Storm Doris is officially upgraded to a weather bomb \nLorraine Smith said that there was no chance she wouldn’t share the win with her best friend Paula Barraclough – and both say the win ‘won’t change’ their friendship. \nThe pair from Sunderland, who call each other Polly and Lolly, have previously put £25 wins towards a joint holiday fund. \nThis time, instead of going towards a trip to the Greek islands, the mammoth win will allow the friends of 17 years standing to fly first class to Las Vegas. North News \nMrs Smith, 54, who is widowed with a son aged 23, bought the winning ticket on the way to work as a cook at a care home on Saturday morning. \nShe was sheltering in a shop at 6.30am, waiting for a bus when she found a £2 coin in her purse and bought a Lucky Dip. \nThat evening she and her son, who is a mechanic, scraped together enough money for a Chinese takeaway as she said they were both ‘skint’ waiting for payday. \nThe next morning she checked the numbers on an app, and felt like she was hallucinating when all six numbers matched. \nAt a news conference in Chester-le-Street, County Durham, Miss Barraclough, who is single, 45, smiled as she recalled: ‘I said to Lorraine, ‘You’d better be ringing to tell me that we have won the lottery’. North News \n‘She said ‘yes’. I knew in her tone of voice it must be true.’ Mrs Smith still went to work and did not claim the prize until 2pm, explaining: ‘I was busy making dinner.’ \nThe friends plan to ‘go wild’ on a shopping spree, with Miss Barraclough looking for Chanel sunglasses and admitting she has an eye for handbags.
