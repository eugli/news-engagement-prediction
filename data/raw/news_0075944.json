The pin represents the wearers' standing together with marginalized groups. \n\"Together, we resist the powers that seek to divide us,\" reads a statement on GLAAD's website . \"We must stand in solidarity. All of us. Because no one is just one identity, and many of us are under attack. All marginalized communities are under attack. The ampersand is the symbol that unites us.\" Recently, the organization has been using its platforms to speak out against the bill which restricts trans students from using the bathroom of their choice. \nJust yesterday, the cast of Moonlight all wore the symbol at the Independent Spirit Awards, where the film — about the tale of a homosexual African American man — picked up the award for best feature. The pin can be purchase for $8 on the GLAAD website. \nAlso spotted on the red carpet were blue ribbons in support of the ACLU , which Ruth Negga wore with her custom, bright red Valentino gown. Stylists Kate Young and Karla Welch also posted about the pin on social media.
