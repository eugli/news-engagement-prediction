Former Kings center DeMarcus Cousins (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 2:11 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 2:11 a.m. ET \nDeMarcus Cousins may be headed to New Orleans to join his new team, but Sacramento will always hold a special place in his heart. \nThe newly acquired Pelicans center shared an emotional farewell Monday with the only city he has known in his seven-year NBA career. Cousins, who was traded to the Pelicans shortly after Sunday night's All-Star Game, appeared to fight back tears as he said goodbye in a sincere show of appreciation. \nVECENIE: Kings get failing grade for disastrous Cousins trade \n\"My love for this city will never change,\" Cousins said. \"Even though I’m gone it’ll still be the same. I’m still looking out for these kids. Every family in this city matters to me. Every soul in this city matters to me. Everything’s the same. I’m just not in a Kings uniform anymore, which is OK because the love is still here.\" My friend got transferred to another city because of his job. He had some things to say. Rough to watch. pic.twitter.com/iBRyMf1UP7 — Carmichael Dave (@CarmichaelDave) February 21, 2017 Guy I know got a job transfer the other day. So we're having a little going away party pic.twitter.com/y55fat4L5U — Carmichael Dave (@CarmichaelDave) February 21, 2017 \nCousins is capable of frustrating his coaches, teammates and an entire front office. That same guy is capable of solidifying a deep connection with members of the local community. It's easy to forget that, in the middle of a chaotic trade, there are people being uprooted from their homes and leaving friends behind. Cousins will always have his detractors, but it's clear he also has plenty of people in his corner — including a two-time MVP. Much respect @boogiecousins . This is what it's about right here! https://t.co/kTriRs84aa — Stephen Curry (@StephenCurry30) February 21, 2017 Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:20:17.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
