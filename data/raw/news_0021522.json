This will allow the Israeli government in future retroactively to expropriate privately owned Palestinian land on which Israeli settlements have been built. It will not help the 40 Israeli families forced to leave their homes in Amona last week, but it could alter the status of as many as 4,000 housing units built on private Palestinian land in the West Bank. This is the first time since Israel annexed East Jerusalem in 1967 that Israel has acted to extend Israeli law to the occupied West Bank. The bill legalises building on private land only in some circumstances, and at least provides for compensation for the owners, either in cash or alternative land. \nThe prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, had previously opposed such a law. His government’s attorney-general has refused either to endorse it or to defend it if it is challenged in Israel’s High Court, as it is widely expected to be. He believes it contravenes the Fourth Geneva Convention. But while Mr Netanyahu was in London for meetings with the British government this week, he was forced by his increasingly unruly right-wing coalition partners to give the law his blessing. Still, Israeli politicians and legal experts fear that the law could potentially open up Israeli officials to prosecution by the International Criminal Court; although Israel is not a member of the ICC, Palestine has been recognised as one.
