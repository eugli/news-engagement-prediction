But I am at peace,” the pontiff said in an interview with Italy’s Corriere della Sera, published on Thursday. \nIn unusually revealing comments, the erstwhile Jorge Bergoglio reveals how feelings of anxiety he sometimes experienced while he was bishop of Buenos Aires disappeared after his elevation to the papacy. \nAnd he insists that he is losing no sleep over the manoeuvring of conservatives opposed to his reforms of church teaching and governance. \nThe 80-year-old says his secret for dealing with stress is to write down all his problems in letters to Saint Joseph.

That’s why I sleep well: it is the grace of God. I always sleep six hours. And I pray,” Francis said. \nThe pope’s reform drive has run into opposition from conservative cardinals and entrenched interests within the Vatican bureaucracy. Tensions have appeared to be running particularly high of late. \nFrancis last month dismissed the head of the Knights of Malta after the ancient order challenged his authority in a dispute seen as being linked to a broader row over the direction of the church. \nAnd the last week has seen a series of anti-pope posters plastered all over Rome. \nAsked how he dealt with such tensions and the challenges he faces, Francis quipped: “I’m not on tranquilisers.

I don’t mind telling you that what I am going through is a completely new experience for me. \n“In Buenos Aires I was more anxious, I admit it. I felt more tense and worried. Basically I wasn’t like I am now. \n“From the moment I was elected I had a very particular feeling of profound peace. And that has never left me. I am at peace. I don’t know how to explain it.” \nIn what may have been an allusion to opponents led by the US cardinal Raymond Burke, Francis implied he had made his intentions clear in meetings with other senior clerics before his election. \n“In the general assemblies we discussed the Vatican’s problems, we discussed reforms. Everyone wanted them,” he said. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:18:18.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
