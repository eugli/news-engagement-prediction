It comes after two Russian jets flew low over a Royal Navy destroyer docked off the coast of Romania in a show of force branded 'unsafe and unprofessional' by Navy officers. And a Russian spy ship armed with surface-to-air missiles with a crew of 200 sailed within 30 miles of a key US submarine base on the Connecticut coastline. The plane was deployed to RAF Mildenhall in Britain (pictured) but it is still not clear exactly why it has been sent to Europe Scores of people filmed a mysterious light travelling through the sky at the weekend and the US Navy released a statement saying its testing of two Trident missiles was 'not in response to any world events' The US Navy have been contacted for comment on the WC-135 but it has not yet released any official comment on the purpose of its mission. And while it is not unheard of for the planes to fly to Europe, missions are rare and its arrival coincides with the detection of Iodine-131. WHY IS IODINE-131 DANGEROUS? Iodine-131 has a very short half life of just eight days, making it very radioactive. When it is present in high levels in the environment, it contaminates food. After it is swallowed it will accumulate in the thyroid. As it decays, it damages body tissue and can cause thyroid cancer. However levels present in the atmosphere today are too low to be damaging. It was first recorded in Norway and have now been found in Poland, Czech Republic, Germany, France and Spain. The isotope has a half-life of only eight days, which suggests the particles must have entered the atmosphere after a recent event. The pattern of movement of the particles suggests they may have originated in Eastern Europe, according to the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA). 'It was rough weather in the period when the measurements were made, so we can't trace the release back to a particular location,' Astrid Liland, head of emergency preparedness at the NRPA, told the Barents Observer . 'Measurements from several places in Europe might indicate it comes from Eastern Europe. 'Increased levels of radioactive iodine in air were made in northern-Norway, northern-Finland and Poland in week two, and in other European countries the following two weeks.' She said it is difficult to pinpoint where the radioactive material came from. The pattern of movement of the radioactive particles suggests they may have originated in Eastern Europe, according to the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA) It's possible that the particles could have come from an incident at a nuclear reactor. An explosion at a plant run by French firm EDF – just 75 miles across the Channel – added to concerns over nuclear safety earlier this month. The company, which is planning Britain’s first nuclear power station in a generation, was forced to shut down its nuclear reactor at the Flamanville plant in Normandy after the blast caused a fire that left five people suffering from smoke inhalation. But the compounds may also have also come from an Iodine plant. The isotope Iodine-131 is used in medicine to treat to thyroid problems and is produced commercially across Europe. Iodine-131 can cause harm because it has a very short half life of just eight days, making it very radioactive. Scientists are yet to explain where the radioactive material came from but the particles may have come from an incident at a nuclear reactor. Pictured above is the Chernobyl nuclear power plant When it is present in high levels in the environment, it can contaminate food and after it is swallowed it accumulates in the thyroid. As it decays, it damages body tissue and can cause thyroid cancer. However levels present in the atmosphere today are too low to be damaging, according to Ms Liland. She said: 'We do measure small amounts of radioactivity in air from time to time because we have very sensitive measuring equipment. 'The measurements at Svanhovd in January were very, very low. So were the measurements made in neighbouring countries, like Finland. 'The levels raise no concern for humans or the environment.'
