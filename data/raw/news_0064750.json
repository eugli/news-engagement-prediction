Shawn Ursini While work on the exterior of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago’s newest medical facility in Streeterville appeared all but done last summer , interior build-out of the 1.2 million-square-foot Shirley Ryan AbilityLab now looks to finally be coming to a close. Designed by HDR and Gensler, the $550 million building will accept its first patients next month, almost a full four years after breaking ground in mid 2013. The soon to open structure will feature a sky lobby, an indoor therapy pool, high-ceilinged conference spaces, and no less than three outdoor gardens. An Argo Tea Cafe has signed a lease for the building’s ground floor retail space. The new building at 355 E. Erie Street will house the entire operation of RIC who will turn over their existing building located one block to the north to Northwestern University. In addition to more traditional rehabilitation facilities and 242 patient beds (with room for approximately 100 more), the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab will also feature so-called “Activities of Daily Living” spaces equipped with non-adaptive kitchens designed to simulate the everyday environment patients will eventually experience outside of the hospital. Head over to Crain’s for further information on RIC’s new Streeterville home and some first-look photos of the interior. The Shirley Ryan AbilityLab’s features a colorful porte cochere along McClurg.
