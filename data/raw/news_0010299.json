The hyper-padded shoulders of the bodysuit seem to be a play on football shoulder pads. \nAt one point, she added a very spiky jacket. \nThe uniform references got even more literal as Gaga's performance went on. She finished off the show with straight-up shoulder pads and a bedazzled harness. \nWhile last night's game was an unpredictable ride, at least we could count on Lady Gaga to be a reliable source of sparkling glamour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:27:19.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
