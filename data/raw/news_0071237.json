That's what we've been asking,\" Thula Thula's Karen Trendler told journalist Bonné de Bod in a Facebook Live video . \"There has been an increasing desensitisation, there has been an escalation in the violence in the poaching and the mutilation.\" \nThe rhinos had been due to have their horns removed next week to protect them from ivory traders, according to local media.
