Many on the island of Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China, see themselves as the legitimate government-in-exile of all of China after the Communist Party took control of the mainland. \nFor that reason, recognition of Taiwan internationally poses an existential threat to China. China has warned Trump that the \"One China\" policy between the US and China was non negotiasble .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T06:26:22.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
