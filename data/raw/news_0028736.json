First things first, the timepiece—officially called Le Marché Des Merveilles—comes from fashion’s hottest brand , and while we’re not saying that a label is the chief reason to buy something, in this case there’s no denying it adds to the watch’s appeal. After all, few things are as instantaneously recognizable or as highly coveted as everything Alessandro Michele makes for the Italian brand. \nBut double-G’s aside, we love this Gucci watch. We also love that this watch literally says “love” on it. The watch strap, in the house’s iconic red-and-blue web stripe pattern, is embroidered with “L'Aveugle par Amour,” which translates to “Blinded by Love.” Equally conceptual—and downright cool—is the watch’s centerpiece, an embroidered snake atop a face the mimics the web stripe strap. Both the language and the reptile are motifs Michele has played with in his last few collections, but they that feels especially additive and unexpected on an accessory like a watch. \nThere are also plenty of details o this Swiss-made timepiece that don’t jump out at first glance. The stainless steel case is engraved with a bee on the back (yet another Michele favorite) and topped with an antireflective sapphire crystal. The strap closes with a sturdy stainless steel ardillon buckle. And, should you one day decide you need a break from being love blind, the strap is wholly removable and can be swapped with any others in your arsenal. What’s not to love about that? \n$790, available at gucci.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T19:59:28.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
