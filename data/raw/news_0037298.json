The latest glimpse at Andromeda comes in the form of a five-minute YouTube video showing off the basics of combat and how the game lets players progress, upgrade weapons, and add new skills. \nAll the core Mass Effect staples are here, including Halo -style firefights and some badass, physics-bending skills straight out of science fiction. \nBut a big change players may notice is the elimination of specific classes in Andromeda . In previous entries in the series, players picked certain roles that restricted what skills and attributes they could attain, but that trade-off came with definitive strengths you could look forward to. Andromeda is favoring a more free-wheeling approach without specific classes. That means you’ll have to pick and choose when to prioritize combat over other skills, but can also blend a wider variety of attributes for a more balanced character. \nMass Effect: Andromeda comes out on March 21 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:58:06.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
