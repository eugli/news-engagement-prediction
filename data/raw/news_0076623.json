But CBFC’s shenanigans ensured that the social media had something to talk about. This time they denied certification to a film called Lipstick Under My Burkha. The new pics of Ranbir Kapoor playing Sanjay Dutt hit the web. Sara Ali Khan opted out of Student Of The Year 2. Shahid Kapoor made it clear that he won’t work with Kangana Ranaut again and Amitabh Bachchan declined Queen Elizabeth’s invite. \nLet’s check out the top five news makers of the week: \nCBFC denies certification to Lipstick Under My Burkha \nAccording to a report in Mumbai Mirror, when Lipstick Under My Burkha was screened for the examination committee, the team decided not to certify it. In fact, the reasons stated in the letter will leave you stunned. The tabloid revealed the contents of the letter from the CBFC, which read as, “The story is lady oriented, their fantasy above life. There are contanious (sic) sexual scenes, abusive words, audio pornography and a bit sensitive touch about one particular section of society, hence film refused under guidelines 1(a), 2(vii), 2(ix), 2(x), 2(xi), 2(xii) and 3(i).” \nOn the set pictures of Ranbir Kapoor as Sanjay Dutt \nA picture, where Ranbir Kapoor looks similar to what Sanjay Dutt looked like in the late ’80s and ’90s, did rounds of the internet recently. The pics were leaked from the sets of the film and from the looks of it, its is evident that the young actor has managed to ape Sanju baba’s style. Shooting for the film is taking place at the Kamal Amrohi Studio in western suburbs of Mumbai. We’re seeing Ranbir ape a young Sanjay Dutt from 1990s where he is dressed in a baggy shirt, a black waistcoat and trousers. In case you weren’t aware of this, the actor has gained 12 kilos for the role. Also read: Leaked!

A source was quoted in DNA after hrs as saying that, “They had a constant difference of opinion during the shoot. Things had reached a point where they were barely talking to each other. In fact, Shahid will never work with Kangana again.” A leading actor, who has never worked with the diva, took it as an opportunity to quip, “At this rate, Kangana will have to do double-role movies where she plays both the hero and the heroine.” \nSara Ali Khan is not doing Student Of The Year 2 \nAfter much speculations, the cat is finally out of the bag. Sara Ali Khan will not be a part of the sequel to the film that launched the careers of Varun Dhawan, Sidharth Malhotra and Alia Bhatt. A source close to Missmalini was quoted in their report as saying that, “It’s very clearly a two-heroine, one-hero film, with Tiger Shroff playing the male lead. Sara will make her debut only in a solo-heroine film. Because of all the media pressure, Karan is getting very anxious about Sara’s debut. He has taken on the responsibility of introducing her and he wants Sara to be as successful as his other Student Of The Year debutante, Alia Bhatt. The correct vehicle for Sara’s debut is awaited.” \nAmitabh Bachchan declines Queen’s invite \nAccording to reports, Queen Elizabeth 2 and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, invited the megastar to launch the UK-India Cultural Year event. However, due to the prior commitments, Big B had to decline the offer. His publicist said in a statement, “Yes, Mr Bachchan has been extended a rare invitation by Queen Elizabeth and Buckingham Palace to grace the UK-India Cultural Year reception. Unfortunately, however, he will be unable to attend due to prior commitments.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T07:39:58.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
