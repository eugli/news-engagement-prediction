Some suspect it will be tied into the iOS software built into the iPhone 8 , while others think Apple may launch a pair of glasses that boast AR technology. Or maybe it’ll be both. Either way, it isn’t a secret that Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, is enamored with AR , and sees it as a big jumping off point for the future. \nNow, Business Insider reports, based on a UBS research note, that Apple has upwards of 1,000 engineers working on AR over in Israel right now. It says that Apple’s first AR effort may see the light of day in the oft-rumored iPhone 8: \n“According to some industry sources, the company may have over 1,000 engineers working on a project in Israel that could be related to AR […] UBS expects Apple could implement new AR products as early as in the next iPhone, expected later this year, which could include “moderate 3D mapping … and possibly an AR software development kit,” the note says.” \nThis would line up with a previous report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo released saying that Apple’s front-facing camera in the iPhone 8 would be “revolutionary,” and that it could boast 3D mapping capabilities. \nAt this point it’s just a matter of time before something happens with AR from Apple, as long as the constant rumors pan out. \nWhat are you hoping to see from Apple in the AR department?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:18:07.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
