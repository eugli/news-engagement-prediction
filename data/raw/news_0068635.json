Those in attendance included former provincial ANC and government officials. \nA businessman once closely linked to Magashule said: \"We need to try and remove the monster, and then we will see after.\" \nA regional leader who participated in the meeting told News24 the province needed to get rid of \"negative tendencies\" associated with Magashule and consolidate and strengthen the ANC in the Free State. \n'Should be about the people' \nThose in attendance were willing to resort to the courts before the ANC’s national elective conference in December, he said. \nSome had already found a replacement for Magashule, in his deputy and former Mangaung mayor Thabo Manyoni. \nManyoni told News24 he had been approached and was available for the position, but would not be keen to stand if Magashule wanted to stay on. \n\"Some people are gatekeepers in the organisation, as a result very good people are excluded in the process,\" Manyoni told News24. \nIt was worrying that political positions were seen as a path to power and financial resources. \n\"It should really be about the people,\" he said. \nThe ANC in the province had a leadership dispute in the lead-up to its 2012 conference. Some members pushed for \"regime change\". The Constitutional Court ruled that the elective conference was unlawful. \n'Thrown everyone away' \nMagashule has been at the helm in the province for 25 years. A former official, who served alongside him, said he had left a wake of destruction. \nAnother source told News24 that many of those seeking Magashule’s downfall were willing to go back to the courts, as they had in 2012. They would seek to frustrate his chances of becoming part of the ANC’s top leadership at its national elective conference in December. \n\"We are aware that our actions might have some implications on his ambitions, but what he has been doing here, he’s likely to do at national level,\" he said. \n\"All his deputies, his provincial secretaries are nowhere to be found, he’s thrown everyone else away,\" said a former official. \nThe official said he was worried that those currently in provincial structures would not feature following the May conference. They included Manyoni, who he said should be the next leader, ANC Free State secretary William Bulwane, and police MEC Sam Mashinini. \nMeeko refused to comment on the allegations, but shouted over the phone: \"You can’ Join the conversation! \n24.com encourages commentary .
