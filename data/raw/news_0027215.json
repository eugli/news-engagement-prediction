Here are the stars who looked less than acca-awesome. 1. CeeLo Green \nCeeLo loves gold! (Photo: Dan MacMedan-USA TODAY NETWORK) \nTwitter had a field day with this gilded ensemble and face mask. From comparisons to Ferrero Rocher candy to \" a villain from an unaired Power Rangers episode,\" his monochromatic look was just too much. \nWe consider this look a scratch. (Photo: Dan MacMedan-USA TODAY NETWORK) \nWhile it's certainly an interesting way to repurpose old CDs after digitizing one's music collection, it's more kitsch than clever. 3. Girl Crush \nBallin' outta control. (Photo: Dan MacMedan-USA TODAY NETWORK) \nThis look is the answer to what would happen if you jumped into a ball pit wearing a skirt made of super glue. 4. Lady Gaga \nMother Monster. (Photo: Dan MacMedan-USA TODAY NETWORK) \nLady Gaga has made a career out of doing the most on the red carpet, and we applaud her body confidence. But her biker chic ensemble was just a little over the top. \nShe's just prepping you for all the flowers you'll see in your newsfeed this week. (Photo: Dan MacMedan-USA TODAY NETWORK) \nKing showed us what happens when you awake from a bed of roses, but you have static cling. On the positive side, the Ex's & Oh's singer tweeted on Jan. 23 that she wanted to \"get on every WORST dressed list,\" so at least King is one of the few keeping her New Year's resolutions. 6. Halsey \nLet's put this look to bed. (Photo: Alberto E. Rodriguez, Getty Images for NARAS) \nDon't go chasing Waterfalls or iconic looks that are really ambitious. The Closer singer said her blue ensemble was inspired by the iconic styles of TLC and Aaliyah, but it seems a bit out of her reach. 7. Nick Jonas \nUrban Cow-brah. (Photo: John Shearer, WireImage) \nThe Close singer's Balmain jacket is on trend... for furniture. Who isn't coveting a headboard or chair with nailheads at the moment? 8. Kirstin Maldonado \nKirstin Maldonado, second from left. (Photo: John Shearer, WireImage) \nThe striped ensemble that the Pentatonix singer donned was not beautiful, a capella music to our eyes.
