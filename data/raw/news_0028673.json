I was in a lot of pain. I was in such a bad way that doctors even told my parents that I was not going to make it.\" \nThe 21-year-old right arm medium pacer, dismissed the entire United team in their second innings for his Karaka side in a senior A match at the Karaka Sports Park last Saturday. \nHe bowled five batsmen, had another four caught and one trapped leg before and finished with figures of 10-31 off 16 overs, a perfect performance considering there wasn't a bye, leg bye, wide or no-ball conceded. \nREAD MORE: \nMonkley was in disbelief with what he'd done. \n\"I was shocked,\" he says. \"Taking 10 wickets in an innings is not something that happens every day. I took three wickets in my first spell and seven in the next. It was unbelievable. \n\"I didn't set out to do. It just happened.\" \nMonkley is the first Karaka bowler to take ten wickets in an innings. The best figures by a Counties Manukau rep player is Warne Ross's 8/32 in 1992. But Counties Manukau cricket boss Trevor Gill says it will be difficult to confirm if it's ever been done in the lower grades before. Ad Feedback \n\"It could be a record. But we've only been keeping electronic records for a few years. Before that the lower grade scores were just kept in books held by the clubs. It's certainly an amazing feat regardless.\" \nMonkley's name will go up on the Karaka honours board. His name will sit below that of Kurt McDonald who's 6-0 off 31 deliveries against United in a premier match only three weeks earlier, rates as the best performance by a Karaka bowler. \nBut the honours board will not tell the whole story. \nIt will not show that Monkley took 5-34 in the first innings for match figures of 15 for 65 or that he scored 54 in the first inning, 46 off 25 deliveries in the second which included six fours and three sixes and the fact that he hit the winning run. \nNor will it tell how lucky Monkley is to be alive, let along running around a cricket field achieving the near impossible. \nThe Rosehill Hill school old boy plunged six storeys off the Auckland Institute of Technology building in downtown Auckland in July of 2012. He was 16 at the time. \nHe was so badly smashed up that doctors told his dad Kayne Monkley​ and mother Zena Campbell to prepare for the worst. \nHe shattered 38 bones in his body, ankles and ribs included. His lungs were perforated, he lost a spleen and has so many steel plates and rods in him that he can't go near a metal detector without setting it off. \nTwo of those rods are in the index and middle finger of the hand that he bowls with. \n\"But I'd rather not dwell on my accident. It's all behind me now. I'd rather focus on the 10 wickets that I took.\" \nMonkley, a sheet metal worker who, despite the fall, hasn't lost his head for heights, did say that it was his love of cricket that helped over the tough times. \n\"I really love cricket. I always have. The desire to play again was one thing that drove my recovery and rehabilition.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:59:58.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
