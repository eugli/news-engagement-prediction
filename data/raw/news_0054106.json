LISTEN ON RADIOPUBLIC Rukmini Callimachi, a reporter for The New York Times, is there in Iraq, where United States-backed government forces are preparing to mount the second stage of their assault on the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. If they regain control of the western half of the city, they’ll reunite Mosul and liberate a city that sits at the heart of the Islamic State’s power and its mission. Rukmini spoke with me last night from her hotel in Iraq about what she’s seeing in Mosul and what this fight means for the future of the Islamic State. On today’s episode: • The biggest Islamic State stronghold in Iraq seems on the verge of falling to United States-backed forces. We go into the streets to see if a major victory over the militant group is really at hand. \nAdvertisement • Why the smartest minds in finance cannot predict the Trump effect on stock prices. Background reading: • Rukmini Callimachi reports from Iraq about the next chapter of the offensive to drive the Islamic State out of Mosul. • Nathaniel Popper’s story on the inconsistent science of predicting the market based on President Trump’s tweets .
