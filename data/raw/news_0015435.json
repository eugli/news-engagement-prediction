He had also experimented with increasing voting centres and minimising the total number of polling days. \nHe said that the EC requires the cooperation of the political parties as well as help from the government machinery, without which the voting process cannot function. \n\"I did not receive the salary from the EC. My case was different. I returned voluntarily to the court,\" he said speaking of his experience of quitting before the end of his tenure. \nHe is currently in good health, said the 82-year-old who continues to remain associated with some socio-cultural organisations. \nMd Abu Hena who headed the commission in 1996 is also fit and fine. He is currently 80 years old. However, he told bdnews24.com that he does not feel very comfortable anymore to speak about the EC. \nThe commission headed by him conducted the polls to the 7th parliament under a caretaker government. \nLike Rouf, he too had to face pressure during Tangail poll held under a partisan government although his performance during the nonpartisan government drew praises. \nHe recently told the media that he believes that the EC selection process should be fair to ensure ‘acceptable’ polls in the current times. He also said that the search committee is inevitable in finding a neutral EC. \nHe too emphasised the need for cooperation from all concerned in ensuring credible and fair polls. \nBoth Rouf and Hena observed that the defeated side always levels charges of foul play. They observed that it had become a part of the political culture. \n“But if the polls are fair, the controversy dies away after the final judgement.” \nATM Shamsul Huda conducted the polls to the 9th Parliament at a time when the country was not under army rule, rather a military-supervised civilian rule. \nHe believes that the demand for a law on making the EC that political parties have made during the discussion with the president is \"a step forward.\" \nHe stressed on political consensus while forming the new EC and said that cooperation from everyone is necessary to conduct a healthy poll. \nHe criticised government control on institutions and said the government of the day, be it a non-partisan or a party based one, \"the victors snatch all.\" \n'Unfortunate culture' \nMuhammad Sakhawat Hussain, an election commissioner at Huda's commission, has expressed his views on the previous commissions along with depicting his experience in a book - 'Nirbachon Commission Panch Bochhor' (Five Years in Election Commission). \nHe has written in the book that two of the former CECs are 'worth mentionable' for controversy. \n\"One of them is Justice Mohammad Abdur Rouf, who was appointed CEC while he was in the Appellate Division during the caretaker government of Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed in 1990,\" he wrote. \nA case had been filed against him becoming the CEC while holding another constitutional post. \nAfter five years, Justice Rouf left the commission and returned to the Appellate Division following the controversial elections to the Magura-2 constituency on Mar 20, 1994, Sakhawat wrote. \nJustice MA Aziz also faced a case after he had succeeded Justice Rouf as the CEC. Justice Aziz's appointment to the EC was ruled ultra vires by the High Court. \nSakhawat wrote that Justice AKM Sadeque had to leave after the one-party 'election' of the BNP on Feb 15, 1996. \n\"His activities also made the EC debatable,\" Sakhawat added. About Abu Hena, the first former bureaucrat to become CEC, Sakhawat wrote that though Hena resigned on health grounds after four years, it appeared there was 'anger' behind his resignation.\nSakhawat, a former army official, also wrote that former bureaucrat MA Sayeed passed the full time of his tenure as CEC, but failed to get the then BNP government's permission to deploy army in Union Parishad elections. \nHe observed that the president had to consult the head of the government all the time to appoint election commissioners in Parliamentary democracy. \"That's why the president had appointed the election commissioners following the advice of the prime minister or the caretaker government head in some cases,\" he wrote. \nIn his words, the appointments of election commissioners always became controversial, particularly after 2001, due to the absence of specific law in this regard. \nAbout the current EC, he wrote that though it was formed through a hurriedly formed search committee, the BNP's stance of 'not accepting it' is 'unfortunate'. \nSakhawat regretted the using of Indian EC as an example of strong EC. \n\"But the system of constituting the EC there is similar to Bangladesh's one. The president there make the appointments following the prime minister's recommendations,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:22:01.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
