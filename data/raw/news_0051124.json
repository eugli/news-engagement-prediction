Fiat Chrysler Automobiles @andrewkrok \nIf your all-wheel-drive car has a chance to lose its front driveshaft, you don't end up with a rear-wheel-drive car -- you end up with a voluntary safety recall. \nFiat Chrysler Automobiles has issued a voluntary recall for 69,298 examples of the 2014-2017 Dodge Charger and 2014-2017 Chrysler 300 , both of which are equipped with all-wheel drive. Per its recall report , FCA estimates that approximately 3 percent of the affected vehicles feature the defect that spurred the recall. Enlarge Image \nA dangling driveshaft is not a very efficient snow plow. Not that I'm speaking from experience or anything. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles \nThe defect relates to the front driveshaft, which rotates to send power to the front wheels. Some of the affected vehicles may \"experience\" loose bolts, as the recall report puts it, which means the front driveshaft may disconnect. \nYou might experience a whole bunch of noise and vibration before the driveshaft disconnects. And if the driveshaft comes loose at speed, it may damage the underbody or powertrain as well as causing a loss of power. None of those things are very nice. \nThe remedy is simple. The recalled vehicles will head to dealers, which will replace all eight front driveshaft bolts at no cost. \nIf you already paid to have this fixed before the voluntary recall, FCA will request the original receipt or adequate proof of payment and send you a check for reimbursement.
