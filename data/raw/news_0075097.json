PHOTO:COURTESY \nGunshots rent the air on Sunday afternoon when supporters of two aspirants for the Nairobi governor's seat clashed during a football match. \nPolice were forced to shoot in the air to disperse supporters of Senator Mike Sonko and former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth's at a tournament in Miutuni ward, Dagoretti South constituency. \nMr Sonko and area MP Dennis Waweru arrived at the Ndunyu Jua Kali grounds in Dagoretti towards the tail end of the match, with his supporters in tow. \nThis appeared to infuriate Mr Kenneth's supporters, who were watching the match and booed as Sonko made his way to the dais where Kenneth was seated. \nA brief altercation between the two groups ensued, forcing Sonko's bodyguards to shoot in the air and evacuate him from the stadium. \nThe football tournament went on as Sonko and his team addressed a crowd that had followed him outside the field. \nNo injuries were reported. \nKenneth condemned the incident, which he termed as unfortunate and unacceptable. \n\"You have seen what has happened. This is unacceptable and should not be allowed to happen again,\" he said. \nBut Sonko defended his presence at the tournament, saying he and Waweru attended as Nairobi leaders. The senator said he had gone to present prizes to the winning team. \n\"We decided to leave the place to avoid violence. As leaders, we advocate peaceful campaigns,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:08:21.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
