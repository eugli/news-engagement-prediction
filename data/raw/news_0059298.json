But in the event that you find yourself without the iconic bread ring, Trader Joe's recently introduced an everything bagel seasoning that'll make other foods \"everything,\" too.

Trader Joe's describes the seasoning as a \"simple (yet exemplary) blend of sesame seeds (white and black), poppy seeds, dried garlic & onion, and sea salt flakes\" that's perfect for adding a savory flavor to grilled chicken, baked potatoes, buttered popcorn, dips, pastas, pizza dough, and several other foods.
