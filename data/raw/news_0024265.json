PUBLISHED: 01:50, Fri, Feb 10, 2017 | UPDATED: 03:07, Fri, Feb 10, 2017 GETTY Syrian President Assad said some of \"peaceful\" looking Syrian migrants are \"definitely\" terrorists \nThe controversial Syrian President – who has received swathes of criticism for allegedly causing the Syrian civil war – said it is difficult to quantify exactly how many refugees are terrorists because “no one has any number\" and \"nobody knows all the terrorists to give a percentage”. \nIn response to a question asking if some of those who fled the civil war are “aligned with terrorists”, Assad quickly said: “Oh, definitely. Related articles European Union supports ISIS, claims Syrian president \n“You can find it on the net. The same picture, those terrorists holding the machine gun or killing people, they are peaceful refugees in Europe or in the West.” \nReferring to the 9/11 terrorist attacks led by Osama Bin Laden , Assad noted that horrific terrorist attacks do not need a large number of militants to coordinate. \nAssad added: “It’s not about the number, it’s about the qualities, their intentions.” \nThe 51-year-old’s comments come after Home Secretary Amber Rudd’s decision to close the ‘Dubs Scheme’ which focused on bringing 3,000 child refugees from countries, including Syria, into Britain.
