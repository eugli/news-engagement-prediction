These renders are accompanied by a video clip which basically shows off those very same images, but in a video format. In any case, both devices are pictured here, and you get to check them out from all angles. Both devices are made out of metal and glass, and they look identical in terms of the design, but the Galaxy S8 Plus comes in a larger form factor, of course. \nAs you can see, the 3.5mm headphone jack is included on both devices, and it is placed on the bottom of the two devices, right next to the USB Type-C charging port. On the other side of the charging port, you’ll notice the microphone, and the phone’s loudspeaker, while antennas are also quite noticeable here. The top portion of these two phones is quite clean, as there are no ports up there, or anything of the sort, only the noise canceling microphone and some more antenna lines. The power / lock key is placed on the right-hand side of these two devices, and the volume rocker buttons are located on their left side along with the rumored ‘Bixby’ button which is supposed to activate Samsung’s Bixby AI assistant . If you take a look at the back of these two devices, you’ll notice the main camera, along with the LED flash, while the fingerprint scanner is also present here. Both the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus feature curved displays in these images, and the top and bottom bezels are quite thin. \nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to sport a 5.7-inch or a 5.8-inch QHD AMOLED display, while the Galaxy S8 Plus will probably ship with a 6.1-inch or a 6.2-inch QHD AMOLED panel. One would think that the two devices will be huge because of such big displays, but considering how thin bezels are on these two phones, it is possible they might be smaller in size than you might think. Both devices will probably ship with a 12-megapixel main camera (f/1.7 aperture), and you can expect to see 4GB / 6GB of RAM included here as well. Android Nougat will come pre-installed on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus, with Samsung’s custom UI installed on top of it. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 64-bit octa-core SoC will fuel both of these smartphones, though there’s a chance Samsung might release the Exynos 8895-powered variants as well. These two smartphones will not be announced at MWC 2017, but they’re expected to land either in March or April.
