I think it’s an ominous threat to academic freedom, not to mention the personal privacy of faculty members,” said Quirmbach, who is also an associate professor of economics at Iowa State. \nIowa backed Donald Trump in November by nine percentage points in the presidential election, and Republicans took control of the governorship and both houses of the state legislature for the first time since 1998. \nRepublicans have moved fast since consolidating power in Des Moines, passing legislation last week to scale back collective bargaining rights for the state’s public workers. \nIowa’s move to the right runs counter to the prevailing political views on university faculties, Chelgren said.

Faculty who voted for Trump said they risked not getting tenure if they made their political views known, according to Chelgren. \nIn an email to the Guardian, Thomas E Vaughn, president of the faculty senate at the University of Iowa, said: “I am not aware of, either directly or anecdotally, any instances of political intimidation or payback directed at University of Iowa faculty as a result of the election.” \nThe Iowa board of regents, which oversees the three public universities, also opposed the bill. \n“We expect our universities to hire the most qualified faculty to teach our students, and we believe in diversity of thought,” Josh Lehman, the senior communications director for the regents, said in a statement. \nDeclaring your party affiliation in Iowa is as simple as filling out a voter registration form, and Chelgren conceded that job applicants could simply switch their registration from Democrat to Republican, or register as independent. \nIn fact, Chelgren said, he would encourage professors to register as independents to remind them that they are supposed to give students a balance of viewpoints. \nQuirmbach agreed that professors need to give students a diversity of viewpoints, but added politics is simply not part of the discussion in most academic disciplines. \nThe economics professor said Chelgren’s proposal had already damaged the reputation of the state’s public universities in academic circles, making recruiting top faculty more difficult.

The amendment, offered by state senator Ralph Hise, a Republican, would cover hiring at state universities, and stated: “Those faculty designated as tenure-track hired and granted tenure at each constituent institution shall reflect the ideological balance of the citizens of the State.” \nThe amendment would bar a university from “a faculty ideological balance of greater or less than two percent of the ideological balance of the state”. \nThe measure was tabled. \nHise said he introduced the amendment simply to make a point about the fallacies of setting aside spots on the board of governors for different demographic groups, the Associated Press reported. \nIn Iowa, Chelgren’s bill was read for the first time this week in the state senate, and then referred to the education committee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:42:27.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
