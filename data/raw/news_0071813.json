The major cause was traced to last year , after the association was factionalised , with each faction accusing the other of sponsoring thugs against the other. \nWhile the Mozoba’s led faction accused sponsor of its rival faction of wanting to forcefully continue with running the affairs of the market by imposing his loyalists on traders as executive members, it has resolved to put the abrasion to an end by any means known to it. \nCounter claim \nBut in an an interview with the association’s acting factional chairman, Mr Achonamokwu Maduekwe , he stated emphatically that Mozoba was no longer chairman of the Fancy and Furniture Dealers Association, revealing that he was impeached last August after a vote of no confidence was passed on him . He also exonerated Azubuike Ekwerekwu, from blame in the whole saga , describing Mozoba’s claim as false. \nMaduekwe explained that trouble set in last year , following allegation of misappropriation of funds and extortion of traders on Mozoba’s led administration . \nAllegations \nHe said: “ In August 2016 we were having problem within the executives. I was the Vice chairman under Mazoba’s regime. Trouble started as a result of Mazoba’s refusal to render account after six months in office. \nFor instance, we did a water project of N5.5 million in our section but there was no account for it. Also, we sold fire extinguisher for N6,200 to shop owners. We realised over N3 million but the money was also not accounted for. \nWe collect N1200 from each shop owner every month for security and electricity bill. \n“It was expected of him to render account of the funds after six months in office but he did not. We were left with no option than to report the issue to our stakeholders, among who are Chief Azubuike Ekwerekwu, alias Obosi, Chief Oke Nwagba and Chief John Nwosu. \nWe also informed them that the association’s bus which was donated by one of Ekwerekwu’s friend was registered in the then Chairman’s name instead of the association’s. Ekwerekwu called him and advised him to heed the advise of members of his executive by rendering a proper account to members”. \nArmed thugs invade market \nThe decision to impeach the chairman according to Maduekwe, followed an invasion of armed men at the association’s secretariat. \nMadueke said : “ That same August, as I was going to our secretariat for a meeting, I saw some strange faces later discovered to be armed cultists. Sensing danger, on noticing that our task force men were not there, I retreated and informed other executives who were also on their way to the meeting. In my frightened state, I called the chairman, to know if he was okay and also to find out why cultists were stationed at the secretariat. He insisted we should come and assist him to chase Ekwerekwu out of Alaba. When we asked why, he said that he (Ekwerekwu) meddled into the association’s affair by requesting him to render account”. \nAlleged high handedness \nHe further alleged that the then chairman intimidated any executive who attempted to question the association account’s, citing an imposition of N50,000 on him and suspension of the then secretary and assistant as examples. Following this action, he said some members of the executive boycotted the association and its meetings, despite persuasions through phone calls. He further alleged that members of executives who refused to bow to the dictates of the chairman , were attacked by thugs. \nImpeachment moves \nUnable to bear the intimidation, Madueke stated that a vote of no confidence was passed on Madueke, followed by a move for his impeachment. He stated that after the move, tags for their respective designations were collected from seven of them, including Madueke. \nImpeachment \nContinuing, Maduekwe said: “We held a meeting and impeached him. After the impeachment, two persons; Victor Udubujo and Victor Irieeiowun were attacked in their shops by hired thugs,for supporting the impeachment move” \nAt the moment, we do not have a substantive chairman in Fancy and Furniture Dealer association but he is still parading himself as the chairman. I am on acting capacity following his impeachment. \nHe is the one terrorising us. Those who went round with him on the day of the purported protest were his loyalists. Some of them harass and intimidate traders and customers”. \nErection of container attachment \nA vivid evidence of who is sponsoring thugs in the market could be traced to an incident that happened last December at Golden Point plaza, after armed men stormed there and carted away money inside a ‘ Ghana must go bag ‘. Customers were also dispossessed of cash and other valuables. \nMoments later, some people returned with the money inside the bag. Till date, there was no explanation on who and where the money was collected from. No arrest was made, neither was the case reported to the Police”. \nWe have written different petitions to the Police, the Department f State Service and the Ojo local development council on the incessant attack on us. \nOnly recently, these gunmen stormed our shop, attacked us and forcefully collected valuables from us”. \nOne of the petitions to the Department of the State Service by Madueke’s led faction, called on the DSS to investigate alleged break down of laws and order and security threat by leader of its rival faction. \nThe statement read: “ He (rival faction leader ) has been unilaterally removing elected officers of the association that were elected alongside him and also promoting activities of cultists to harass and intimidate elected members. The Chief welfare officer of the association, his assistant and the treasurer were molested and beaten to coma by cult boys at on December 12, 2016 in the market. \nPolice on top of situation \nPolice sources at Ojo division admitted to be in the know of activities at the market , adding that the situation was being contained . \nA senior police officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity said “We have made arrests of suspected cultists from that axis and transferred same to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department , SCIID. \nThe situation is under control, as we have cautioned leaders of both factions to call their loyalists to order or face the wrath of the law if they offend the laws of the land. They have assured us to maintain law and order”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:14:25.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
