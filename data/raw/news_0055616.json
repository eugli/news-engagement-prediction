SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Investors rushed to buy stocks after Trump's win in the belief that taxes will be slashed and infrastructure spending will rise. Photo: Anthony Behar \nThe Trump administration action withdrew that guidance while the Justice and Education departments continue to study the legal issues involved. \nReversing the Obama guidelines stands to inflame passions in the latest conflict in America between believers in traditional values and social progressives, and is likely to prompt more of the street protests that followed Trump's November 8 election. Related Content Trump expected to reverse Obama rule on transgender students' rights \nA couple hundred people gathered in front of the White House to protest the Trump action, waving rainbow flags and chanting: \"No hate, no fear, trans students are welcome here.\" The rainbow flag is the symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. \nIt was expected Trump would revoke the landmark guidelines , despite a fight over a draft order that pitted his Attorney-General Jeff Sessions against the Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.
