THE GOOD: New Orleans \nThe Big Easy remains the undefeated GOAT of All-Star locations. The city just shines as a true reflection of the soul of the NBA and the spirit of the weekend. All-Star Weekend is, at its heart, a celebration, and no city celebrates with more joy than this city, even after the disaster of Hurricane Katrina, the economic catastrophe of 2008, and even a deadly tornado that ripped through lower-income neighborhoods last week, prompting two locals I talked with to argue about which disaster has been worse. The city still vibrates with energy and the NBA both feeds off that power and injects much-needed revenue and community service projects. \nSchools are renovated, money is raised, kids are given opportunities to interact with stars and get valuable lessons. Sponsors put together spaces that not only showcase their brands, but tap into New Orleans’ deep well of cultural currency. The parties are everywhere and the music is popping along with the champagne. All this while the beginning of Mardi Gras begin to slide through the city as parades took over much of Saturday in the French Quarter. It should be a disaster of logistics, and yet, everyone kind of figures it out in New Orleans, and that kind of style is part of why the city was perfect as a replacement option for the league. \nIt’s the funny anecdote that lingers around the event: this was never was supposed to be here. Charlotte had the event up until last fall, when the North Carolina’s controversial HB2 law forced the league’s hand in moving the event to continue with their self-ascribed values of inclusion. So they chose the city where diversity is a constant, mixed in with the beads and the booze and the music. \nBut even on a shortened timeline, New Orleans pulled it off. It brings to mind the question, should New Orleans just host the All-Star Game every year? \nAnthony Davis said he’d love it, that hosting it is a thrill and also personally convenient for him, but both Davis and James Harden expressed reservations on behalf of the players on the idea. Players all want to share the game, and move it from city to city within the league. But the NBA should still consider making New Orleans the event’s permanent home. It can handle the hotel needs, it can handle the influx of people, and it showcases not just the events, but the league’s surrounding culture, from art to hip hop. \nNew Orleans keeps facing challenges. New Orleans keeps rising to the occasion. THE ALSO GOOD: Eric Gordon, 3-point champion \nThere’s something fitting that Gordon returned to New Orleans, where he spent four years after being traded from the Clippers and then re-signed against his will by restricted free agency rights from the Pelicans, and won the 3-point contest. Gordon never wanted to play in New Orleans, and could never get healthy. \nBut he’s thriving in Houston, and his shot has been liquid gold. His extra-frame victory over Kyrie Irving showed that the Gordon who used to be talked about as an elite guard is back. And the local fans can only wonder why he could never be that with the Pelicans. THE BAD: All-Star Saturday Night brought to you by these zillion sponsors \nThe league wants to make money. I get that. That makes sense. But they have found ways to drive commercials into every event. Two guys go in the skills contest? COMMERCIAL BREAK. A guy goes through a 3-point rack? COMMERCIAL BREAK. Over and over. The musical guests and segments are necessary, but in part because of the drawn-out, forced nature of the event, and partly because of the crowd, which is priced out and made up mostly of corporate sponsors, the crowd was dead. There was no life to the event, no energy. That’s part of a trend over the last few years. \nIt needs to feel like the room is buzzing, and with players lazing through the skills competition, missing dunks, and lounging in chairs courtside, it feels like anything but that. It doesn’t have to be serious, this is the All-Star Weekend, after all. It just has to feel fun. And Saturday felt forced. THE AWESOME: This. All of this.
