Editor Advertisement \nI knew it! Ever since news of Nokia relaunching their iconic 3310 phones, somehow don;'t see how they will want to bring in that phone. With the phone running on 2G Network, and Singapore ending its 2G network by April this year, bringing in Nokia 3310 for sale here just is not making sense. \nToday, it has been confirmed. The iconic phone is not likely to be brought into Singapore to be sold in the open market, simply because they cannot run on any 2G networks here. So, spoilsport Singapore has done it again. While people all over the world rejoice in bringing back an iconic phone that ruled the market long before androids and smart phones were a word, Singapore can just look from afar and collectively say we once owned those phones, but will never own it ever again today. \nSingapore is all about the future, the past has long been consigned to the rubbish bin. \nChio LS \nA.S.S.
