That acceptance has raised the prospect that Russia, after meddling in the election to try to tip the vote to Mr. Trump, as United States intelligence agencies have said , is now gleefully stoking divisions in America by backing a radical liberal movement. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Marinelli, who said he supported only nonviolent means of opposition, described his presence in Russia as coincidental, and he denied any ties to Russian officials. Before the American presidential election, Mr. Marinelli said he saw no harm in taking a year off to teach English in Russia; his movement had been only creeping along anyway, financed with his credit card and run from his home in San Diego. Mr. Trump’s victory and the subsequent boom in interest in the push for secession caught him unprepared. “We just had that surprise event of Donald Trump winning, and it just dumped thousands and thousands of people behind our campaign all of a sudden,” Mr. Marinelli said in an interview in his home office here that doubles as a bedroom, and is festooned with a California flag. His mailing list exploded to 160,000 names, and the number of registered volunteers surged to about 8,000 from around 400. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released last month showed that about one of 3 Californians supported the idea of seceding peacefully from the union.

Credit James Hill for The New York Times The campaign got a new fillip in January when the state attorney general, Xavier Becerra, approved language for a Yes California-backed ballot measure for the 2018 election, clearing the way for signature gathering. It has also earned about $60,000 in donations, Mr. Marinelli said. The measure would ask voters to remove a reference in the state’s Constitution to California as an inseparable part of the United States and set a second vote, for March 2019, that would ask, “Should California become a free, sovereign and independent country?” But backers need to collect 585,407 valid signatures, a daunting task. David A. Carrillo , the director of the California Constitution Center at the University of California, Berkeley, is not among the supporters. “California seceding is so unlikely to happen it’s a waste of our time even to discuss it,” Mr. Carrillo said in a telephone interview. “Even if the state could secede, it’s a terrible idea.” In the United States Constitution, Mr. Carillo said, “there is a no procedure for allowing states to leave, and if you want a practical example, there is the Civil War.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
