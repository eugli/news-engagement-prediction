Nearby, a small plane's propellers begin to spin.\nHe immigrated from Morocco in 2010 and completed a master's degree at Laval University in vegetable biology four years later.\n\"My future here? To be honest, I'm not optimistic,'' he said over the loud buzzing of the propellers.\nExploring the roots of Islamophobia in North America A few hours earlier, several kilometres away in Quebec's City famed Place d'Youville square, Bachreir Ikhlef, 37, was sitting in his taxi waiting for his next passenger.\nHe said when he came to Quebec City as a programmer from Algeria in 2011 he was \"full of energy.''\nA job councillor suggested he get a diploma from a Quebec college in order to help strengthen his resume.\n\"We were 25 who started the diploma, and by the end only 12 of us finished,'' he said about his programming certificate.\n\"Myself and a Tunisian guy didn't even get an internship. Neither of us have found work in our field.''\nOverqualified minorities struggle to find work Government and private-sector research over the past 10 years consistently indicate immigrants, particularly visible minorities, have higher unemployment rates in Quebec than the rest of the population.\nThe left-leaning, Quebec-based research group IRIS, indicated in 2016 that 43 per cent of immigrants are overqualified for the jobs they hold.\nQuebec Premier Philippe Couillard and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attend a funeral service for three of the six victims of the Quebec City mosque shooting. (Paul Chiasson/CP)\nPremier Philippe Couillard told reporters Thursday that \"our society has the same demons that others have to deal with: Xenophobia, racism, exclusion.\n\"Why is unemployment higher among immigrants? That's a question we must ask ourselves but this has nothing to do with [the shooting] of this week.''\nHundreds gathered in Montreal and Quebec City for two separate ceremonies honouring the six men who died after a 27-year-man allegedly entered a mosque and began shooting last Sunday night.\nPoliticians and community members said during both commemorations that neighbours must begin to speak to one another more, in order to foster understand between groups.\n'Nothing ever changes' Couillard spoke about the need for employers to hire people not based on their last name, but on their competence.\n\"A lot has been heard this week,'' Couillard told the funeral gathering in Quebec City on Friday, regarding the kind words from citizens expressing love towards the city's Muslim minority.\n\"Let's hope a lot has been learned.''\nBack at the airport taxi stand, Essekkouri said many people in the city know all about how many immigrants are overqualified for their jobs.\n\"Journalists have come here before and asked the same questions to taxi drivers,'' he said. \"It's been done.
