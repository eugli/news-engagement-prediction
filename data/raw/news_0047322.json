Voting against the proposal were Jacqueline Gates, Michael Paradine and Connie Rosenbayger. \nThe vote will allow a group of retired educators and others to create a high school for the performing arts in the building, which also formerly housed Westinghouse High School in Wilmerding. \nThe proposal had been controversial, with Wilmerding residents and officials supporting the plan, which they say will help revitalize Wilmerding. \nThe East Allegheny Education Association, the teachers’ union, opposed it on the grounds it may someday cost some teachers their jobs if too many students move to the charter school. \nImmediately before the voting meeting, attorney Amelia Brett, who represents the charter school group, outlined the terms of a memorandum of understanding with the district. \nUnder the conditions of the memorandum, the charter school group agreed to cap at 10 the number of students coming from East Allegheny to the charter school for an undetermined number of years; agreed to allow each East Allegheny student to take one class at the charter school for free; and agreed to pay all transportation costs of East Allegheny students to and from the charter school. \nThe charter school group also agreed to pay real estate taxes for the first five years of the school, and fees in lieu of real estate taxes to the district for the school’s second five years. \nMr. Pearsol and Mr. Savinda both mentioned the memorandum as a reason why they voted in favor of the charter school. \nAt an earlier work session, an auditor from the firm of Hosack, Specht, Muetzel & Wood, LLP told the board that the district’s deficit has now increased to about $4.8 million. \nAfter the meeting, superintendent Donald L. Mac Fann said district administrators recommended the charter plan primarily because of the memorandum. \n“It will generate revenue streams within the next decade equaling $1.5 million,” Mr. Mac Fann said. \nHe said the district will also receive about $400,000 for the building. East Allegheny School District will also receive other revenue for providing shared cafeteria and catering services for the next 10 years, Mr. Mac Fann said. \nAnne Cloonan is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:05:17.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
