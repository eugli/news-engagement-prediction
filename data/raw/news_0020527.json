Two Republican Senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined 46 Democrats and two Democrat-caucusing Independents, in an effort to scupper DeVos confirmation. \n\nDemocrats failed to get \"just one more\" vote that they searched for through an all-night debate as protestors kept vigil outside and online, opposing a nominee widely seen as poorly qualified to serve as education secretary. DeVos is a long-time Republican and is a billionaire from one of Michigan's wealthiest families. \n\nShe had stumbled through her confirmation hearing, inviting ridicule for, among other things, her suggestion that a school in Wyoming might want to have guns on premises to protect against grizzly bears.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:17:52.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
