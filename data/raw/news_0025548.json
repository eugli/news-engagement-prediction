His wife was killed, purportedly when she tried to fight back with a shotgun. \nThe couple had been sailing the oceans for many years aboard their 53-footer, the Rockall. They were held for 52 days in Somalia in 2008 before their captors freed them, reportedly after a six-figure ransom had been paid. \nThe Abu Sayyaf, an insurgent group known for kidnapping foreigners for ransom, has defied more than a decade of US-backed military offensives against it and has conducted a lucrative kidnapping spree in recent years. \nIn 2014, the militants abducted another German couple off a yacht in the southern Philippines. They released the pair six months later after receiving what they said was the full ransom demand of US$5.1mil (RM22.68). - The Straits Times/Asia News Network", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:38:45.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
