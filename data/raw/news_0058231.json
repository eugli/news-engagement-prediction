Things you didn't know about Marine Le Pen Mon, February 20, 2017 Marine Le Pen is a French politician who is the president of the National Front, a national-conservative political party in France and one of its main political forces. AFP/Getty Images 1 of 10 Described as more democratic and republican than her nationalist father, she has led a movement of \"de-demonization of the Front National\" to detoxify it and soften its image \nAn Elabe poll has Marine Le Pen surging ahead of her rivals and snatching 28 per cent of the vote, while her nearest rival and former frontrunner Francois Fillon loiters on 21 per cent of the vote.Cindy Blain, a 27-year-old pharmacist in the rural north east of France, said: “What she is proposing is really different, just like Trump offered something really new. \n“Maybe if we see Trump succeed, then voters will give her a chance.”In 2012 Le Pen trailed behind with female voters, winning only 17 per cent compared with 20 per cent of men’s ballots. Now she’s closed that gender gap. GETTY The polls for the first round of voting have been favourable viewing for Le Pen \nEarlier this month Le Pen’s team dispersed four million copies of a campaign brochure that clearly highlights her presidential aims.The pamphlet displayed her navigating “the world of men” as a sister, mother, lawyer and political leader. It included a promise to be a shield against Islamic fundamentalists who, she said, want to stop women “wearing a skirt, going to work or to the bistro.” GETTY Justice and security are important factors for french female voters \nNicolas Lebourg, a researcher on French far-right politics at the University of Montpellier said: “Le Pen isn’t asking for equality, she’s promising justice and security.”“And that often resonates more with women facing the challenges of everyday life.”As well as the surge of support from women, surveys show she has gained support among less-educated voters, rural communities and those in lower-paid jobs. She has doubled her poll scores among retirees. Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:28:11.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
