The statement tweeted by Steph on Thursday (Photo: Twitter/@Stephdavis77) She also shared this quote from Jeremy alongside one of his old tweets (Photo: Twitter/@Stephdavis77) \n\"Stephanie has felt humiliated by Jeremy denying his own son and foolishly announcing publicly his request for a DNA test,\" the statement read. \n\"Jeremy has caused Stephanie massive amounts of stress, pressure and upset throughout her pregnancy, ruining what for most women is one of the most special time[s] of their lives.\" \nIt went on: \"Jeremy has at no point throughout the pregnancy or birth been in contact directly with Stephanie. Jeremy was categorically not banned from the birth, nor did he ever ask to attend. Jeremy appeared tearful on This Morning (Photo: Rex Features) He said he'd \"110%\" stand up and be a dad if the paternity test gave a positive match (Photo: Rex Features) \n\"Jeremy has been given the option at all times to take part in a DNA test, because of past behaviour Stephanie has requested that this is handled via the correct channels and managed by her solicitor.\" \nThe statement also brought up Jeremy's \"audacity\" at turning the situation \"into a media circus\" and accused him of trying to handle it \"on his terms only\". \nBut Steph has since taken down the statement, plus screengrabs of a previous tweet posted by Jeremy that denied it was his baby. \nMirror Celeb has contacted Stephanie for comment. Stephanie has been out of hospital with her newborn boy for a month now (Photo: WENN.COM) \nMeanwhile, Jeremy has been busy doing some clearing up of his own social accounts, having deleted a string of abusive messages sent to him on Facebook after he shared a clip of his This Morning interview. \nHe was quickly met with a barrage of negative comments from viewers and fans. (Photo: Instagram/Jeremy McConnell) (Photo: Instagram/Jeremy McConnell) \nIn between foul-mouthed insults, one person wrote: \"God he will do anything for abit of publicity!! He's a first class t***er (sic)\" \nAnother commented: \"Said he would of been at the birth .... was in Thailand getting smashed ! Dad of the year (sic)\" (Photo: Instagram/Jeremy McConnell) (Photo: Instagram/Jeremy McConnell) \nAfter the strongly-worded backlash, Jeremy appeared to first delete all the negative responses - before then removing the post itself.
