The U.S. Navy sent the USS Carl Vinson, along with its strike group, through the South China Sea on Saturday, to conduct “routine operations.”\nPrior to arriving in the South China Sea, the strike group conducted training off the islands of Hawaii and Guam, the Navy said.\n“The training completed over the past few weeks has really brought the team together and improved our effectiveness and readiness as a strike group,” said Rear Adm. James Kilby, commander of the strike group.\n“We are looking forward to demonstrating those capabilities while building upon existing strong relationships with our allies, partners, and friends in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region,” he said.\nThe last time the Vinson deployed to the South China Sea was in 2015, to conduct a bilateral exercise with the Royal Malaysian Navy and Royal Malaysian Air Force, the Navy said in a statement.\nThe Vinson first operated in the South China Sea in 1983 and has operated there during 16 previous deployments over its 35-year history, it added.\nOther U.S. ships have navigated the South China Sea last year, to counter China’s claims of sovereignty, but this deployment was the first under President Trump.\nThe Vinson’s deployment to the area comes about two weeks after a Chinese aircraft that patrols the skies and detects threats flew within 1,000 feet of a U.S. surveillance aircraft. Pentagon officials had played that event down as unintentional.\nIt also comes after a Navy plan was sent up to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to increase operations in the area, although it’s not clear if it has been approved yet.\nThe plan would see the U.S. conducting “Freedom of Navigation Operations,” or FONOPs, within 12 nautical miles of the islands, within what China claims is its territorial waters.\nMattis signaled support for a potential increase in FONOPs during a press conference on Feb. 4 while in Japan.\n“Freedom of navigation is absolute, and whether it be commercial shipping or our U.S. Navy, we will practice in international waters and transit international waters as appropriate,” he said.\n National Security , China , navy , South China Sea", "external_links": ["http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fnational-security%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Fchina-slams-deployment-us-aircraft-carrier-south-china-sea%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=China+Slams+Deployment+of+U.S.+Aircraft+Carrier+to+South+China+Sea&shortener=bitly", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fnational-security%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Fchina-slams-deployment-us-aircraft-carrier-south-china-sea%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=China+Slams+Deployment+of+U.S.+Aircraft+Carrier+to+South+China+Sea", "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-china-usa-idUSKBN1600V0", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fnational-security%2F2017%2F02%2F21%2Fchina-slams-deployment-us-aircraft-carrier-south-china-sea%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=China+Slams+Deployment+of+U.S.+Aircraft+Carrier+to+South+China+Sea"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:55:39.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
