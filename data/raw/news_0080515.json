Close Black Power couple say their vows UP NEXT VIDEO A video of a Kiwi gang wedding has gone viral after it appeared on social media. Source: Facebook/The Uce Hub Black Power couple say their vows \nSporting a rats tail haircut, a Black Power t-shirt and a chilled out demeanour, the groom can be seen sitting next to his wife-to-be as she nestles a crate bottle of beer in-hand while donning a casual skirt and jandals. \nThe gathering, which appeared to be a scaled-down version of most traditional wedding parties, took place in a backyard filled with fellow gang members, whanau, friends, and a paddling pool of with Export Gold beer crates. \nAs the wedding celebrant does her thing, the groom responds with the Black Power greeting 'Yoza' in place of the more commonly used 'I do'. \nAt one point, the celebrant tells the groom that he can hold his soon-to-be-wife's hand while the vows are read out. \nHowever, the couple strike difficulty as she's already holding a quart of beer in her hand. The happy couple. Photos: Facebook/The Uce Hub \n\"I usually say you can put your flowers down, but however,\" the celebrant can be heard saying. \nTowards the end of the clip, the celebrant makes the mistake of calling the groom Corey rather than Codey - a move the bride jokes will \"cause a domestic\". \nThe celebrant then worryingly reminds them that she \"already started one at the beginning\" of the ceremony, before hurriedly following that up with \"we won't go there\". \nSpeaking to NZME , the Masterton celebrant, Gaye Blake-Gough, said she was \"happy and proud\" to have been asked to feature in the unique wedding. \n\"They're a very lovely couple and very much in love and they live in my community in Masterton,\" she said. The beer was kept cool in a paddling pool. Photos: Facebook/The Uce Hub \nAs can be expected, the viral video struck a chord with hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders. \n\"What the f*** did I just watch,\" one person commented. \n\"Hopefully they take their marriage as serious as they do drinking,\" another wrote. \nOne person added: \"No judgement here each one to there own love has no limits colours or boundaries.\" \nThe video has had over 700,000 views since being posted to 'The Uce Hub' Facebook page. \nIt has also amassed thousands of comments, 'likes' and 'reactions'. \nFIND out what people are saying about this story on our Facebook page .
