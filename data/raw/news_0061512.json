USA TODAY Sports Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Rose (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCLEVELAND — The next rebuild for Phil Jackson and the New York Knicks will have to wait. Chaos, though, can begin right away. \nThat’s not surprising. If there is little continuity on the floor with players and coaches on a revolving door as the losses have piled up, dysfunction is the one constant. The trade deadline passed Thursday afternoon with the Knicks — despite declaring an open market for the two highest-paid players on the roster, Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Rose — standing pat on their struggling roster. \nAnd the immediate effect is that the Knicks locker room is stocked with players who are well aware that they were unwanted by management and, frankly, aren’t very impressed with the leadership of the 23-34 team. Back from the All-Star break, the Knicks took the floor against the Cavaliers, and to add insult to injury, seated courtside next to Cleveland owner Dan Gilbert was Charles Oakley . \nBut the continuing Oakley and James Dolan drama was just a distraction to the more pressing concerns. \nMORE: Post NBA trade deadline, can any team challenge the Cavs in the East? \nThere is Anthony, who has absorbed a series of stinging critiques from Jackson, the Knicks’ president, and his pals. After one particularly vicious article penned by Jackson crony Charley Rosen, Anthony responded angrily Jan. 15 and from there the relationship has deteriorated as the Knicks star feels that Jackson has tried to prod him to waive his no-trade clause. \nAnd there is Rose, acquired in the summer and after starting with hopes of signing a long-term extension with the Knicks, now clearly on the outs with an expiring contract. The Knicks could not move him in a possible deal to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Ricky Rubio, so Rose is still in uniform knowing that he will be auditioning for other teams over the final 25 games of the season and that what he has known since the season opener here in Cleveland still applies — that the triangle offense is not helping him create a market for himself. \n\"It’s just different,\" Rose said in the morning while waiting for news on whether he would be dealt away. \"It’s a different offense. You’re always in the corner as a point guard. ... Every game is something different. You’re trying to figure out different players, different options you have. I get all of my points off of random baskets. It’s never like where unless you see me go to the post, then you know it’s a play for me. But all the other stuff is just random basketball.\" CLOSE x Share USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt breaks down the biggest story lines in the East as the regular season winds down. USA TODAY Sports \nRose had been presented with the possibility of finishing out the season with former coach Tom Thibodeau in Minnesota, where he could have flourished in a familiar system. But the Knicks and Timberwolves could not come together on a deal with varying reports of why, although one Western Conference executive said that he heard the Knicks were trying to demand extra pieces in the deal and relented late, but too late for the Timberwolves to come back to the table. \nWhile it may be understandable that Jackson would move cautiously in the trade market after getting the short end of every deal he has made so far, a straight-up swap of those point guards was hard to argue against. The deal seemed a win-win for both sides. Rose is a free agent at season’s end and has not been the fit the Knicks had hoped he would be. The Timberwolves, who have Kris Dunn as the point guard in waiting, could have used Rose to try to make a playoff push, and then had Rubio’s remaining two years off the books. \n\"I just got a text from Phil kind of right at the deadline, saying, 'We’re sticking with what we have,' \" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said. \"So I don’t know what happened in any trade scenarios, but it’s kind of what we thought. We didn’t think anything else would happen.\" \nMORE: Why Lakers' Jeanie Buss fired Jim Buss, Mitch Kupchak \nIt wasn’t for a lack of trying as Jackson has spent months trying to prod Anthony to waive his no-trade clause and the front office engaged in discussions around the league of what he could bring back in a package. The Knicks then moved to efforts to ship Rose and his expiring contract out, but could not make a deal. \nSo once again, the direction is clouded. The Knicks have two stars who they didn’t want and a rebuilding project that is on hold. \nThe Oakley appearance may not matter in the big picture, but perhaps his words were fitting on this night. Asked about his resistance to the urging of NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and even Michael Jordan to make peace with Dolan, Oakley said, \"How long would it take you to get over it?\" \nAnthony and Rose might be thinking that exact thing right now. \nSteve Popper writes for The Bergen Record, part of the USA TODAY Network.
