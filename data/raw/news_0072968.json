Construction Ltd. for a paving project on Highway 16 in Prince Rupert, announced Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Todd Stone. \n“I had the opportunity to visit Prince Rupert last October and announce our commitment to this project with Mayor Brain,” said Stone. “These roads serve as Prince Rupert’s main thoroughfare, so it was important for the ministry and the city to make these improvements a priority.” \nThe work will include paving 4.3 kilometres from the BC Ferries Terminal to McClymont Bridge, Ridley Island Road and Port Edward Arterial. The City of Prince Rupert will also be partnering with the ministry to resurface 3rd Avenue West, which is expected to cost the city approximately $500,000. Work is anticipated to get underway in April and be completed by July. \n“We saw the opportunity to achieve economies of scale and save money on the much-needed repaving of 3rd Avenue by partnering with the Provincial Highway repaving contract. Bundling the two projects creates efficiencies for both the City and the Province,” said Mayor Lee Brain. “We look forward to seeing these plans come to fruition in 2017.” \nThis project is part of B.C. on the Move, the B.C. government’s 10-year transportation plan for the improvement of the province’s transportation network. Over the next three years, the ministry and its partners are investing over $4.6 billion in priority transportation investments as part of this plan. \nLearn More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:24:41.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
