And he is leaving no stone unturned to promote is comeback film which is why he was present on the sets of The Kapil Sharma Show recently. A source close to Pinkvilla, has, in their report, revealed that during the show, Govinda’s son Yashwardhan was also present and Navjot Singh Sidhu started singing praises of him. That’s when Sunita, Govinda’s wife, told a funny story. She revealed that she wanted a handsome son and hence she had kept Big B and Dharmendra’s photos by her side while she was pregnant. Hearing this revelation, everyone burst into laughter. And it indeed is a funny story as basically she is crediting Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan for her son’s good looks. \nLooks like the episode featuring Govinda and his wife is going to be super funny. \nTalking about Govinda’s comeback film, Aa Gaya Hero will now take longer than expected to release. The movie, which was scheduled for a March 3 release, will now hit the theatres on March 16 which is a Thursday. According to Pinkvilla, when they contacted Govinda to know the reason behind the delay, he said, “My movie is releasing not on March 17, but is hitting the screens on March 16. I was not getting many theatres. I want more theatres to be available for my film. As two movies (Commando 2 and Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai) are releasing on March 3, I wasn’t getting theatres.” Also read: Varun Dhawan on Govinda: I am his fanboy forever, won’t comment if he was wrong \nWhen he was further quizzed about the release of the film being on a Thursday rather than a Friday, he said, “Yes I am releasing my movie a day before. Even if I have to buy a theatre and release my movie, I will. So, I will be coming on March 16.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T15:14:36.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
