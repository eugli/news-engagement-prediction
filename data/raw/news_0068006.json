Keep smiling! Mourinho of all people melts hearts with touching message to Ranieri \nWidely expected to go down as one of the greatest sporting achievements of all time, Ranieri’s remarkable work has counted for little in his favour this season as his side slipped down the table . \nLeicester are now just a point above the relegation zone, and have won only one of their last nine games in all competitions. \nStill, football romantics can’t quite believe how ruthless the club have been in their handling of the situation, and have laid into Leicester for bringing a true footballing fairytale to a sad end… Claudio Ranieri? Sacked? Really? Dilly Ding Dilly Game's Gone. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:28:48.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
