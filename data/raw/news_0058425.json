But as Argentinian First Lady Juliana Awada made her official arrival at the Zarzuela Palace today with her husband, President Mauricio Macri, it was clear that she and Spain’s Queen Letizia had a lot in common, at least stylistically. Both awash in a pale and optimistic shade of pink, these two stately women standing together made a very pretty diplomatic picture. Strolling alongside one another in front of the sprawling palatial façade, the duo chatted world affairs, with Letizia buttoned into a sleek blazer that cinched at the waist with a thin, pale belt in a faint shade of blush. Layering a knee-length pencil skirt underneath and accenting the look with flesh-toned pumps, the Spanish royal and former journalist slipped a pale lace blouse underneath her tailored separates for a textured finish. Beside her, Awada was elegantly wrapped into a fur-trimmed pink dress coat and wore a pair of Valentino Rockstud pumps. Peeking out from under her topper was a matching pink lace top very similar to Queen Letizia’s. With their hair pulled up, the two women, who have both been praised for their fashion-forward public appearances on the world stage, seemed totally in step. Of course, this isn't the first time Awada has matched with her female political contemporaries: Former First Lady Michelle Obama ’s headline-making visit to the country last spring had the two women twinning in drop-waist, twirl-skirt frocks . And while fashion hardly clinches the deal when it comes to international diplomacy, the ladies’ looks were at least examples of how two well-coordinated women can send a strong message together.
