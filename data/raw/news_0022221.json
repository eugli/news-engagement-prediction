Key points: Islamic State suspected of carrying out the attack, despite a limited presence in Afghanistan Aid workers selflessly doing their duty, says ICRC president. Red Cross convoy was heading to areas hit by snow storms and avalanches last week \nThe slain aid workers were ferrying supplies to communities in the country's north, cut-off by heavy snow. \nIn a video message on Twitter, the ICRC's director-general Yves Daccord was clearly outraged that the organisation with a 30-year history of impartial humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan would be targeted. \n\"We just learned a few hours ago that we have lost colleagues in Afghanistan and I must just say that seems at first impossible,\" Mr Daccord said. \n\"It was a region we knew very well and it's really very experienced colleagues and knowing that they have been killed, attacked directly is the worst possible news.\" External Link: ICRC tweets \"It seems impossible...\" A message from our Director-General @YDaccordICRC on the attack of our colleagues in Jawzan province, #Afghanistan. \nICRC director of operations Dominik Stillhart said the incident left the Red Cross little option. \n\"As we speak, our operations are on hold indeed, because we need to understand what exactly happened before we can hopefully resume our operations,\" he said. \nThe organisation said its convoy — three drivers and five field officers — were on their way to deliver livestock materials to communities affected by recent heavy snow storms when it was attacked by unknown armed men. \nThe ICRC said the two remaining staff were unaccounted for. \nJowjzan's Governor and police chief said IS fighters were most likely responsible. \nIn a recent report on its work in Afghanistan, the ICRC said it was worried about the \"shrinking access of humanitarian aid workers in many parts of the country\", because of \"the intensification of conflict-related violence\". \nBut Mr Stillhart said the area was not considered especially dangerous. \n\"We do a lot to ensure the safety and security of our staff and this particular part of the country, with this particular road, is one that we considered rather safe, as safe as it can get anywhere in Afghanistan,\" he said. \nThe suspension of such vital humanitarian assistance could hardly come at a worse time for Afghans, battling natural disaster on top of continuing violence. \nDozens have died in avalanches from the recent snowstorms, and many communities remain isolated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:53:48.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
