there's very little you can do these days without having to provide a criminal record check,\" she said. \n\"So it is actually becoming perhaps a bigger problem than it was a decade ago when criminal record checks weren't as prevalent as they are now,\" she said. \nLGBTQI activist and Sydney trans woman Danika Hardiman, 24, said it was shocking to discover there are people out there whose sexuality was criminalised. \n\"It's another battle we have to face against homophobia..even if it only affects a small minority it's important and symbolic,\" she said. \n\"Even if you're not going to be personally affected, what does it say to Australian society at large that people have been convicted as sex offenders for engaging in homosexual sex?\" Reform in the NT more complex \nHack understands more than 30 Supreme Court Records exist for offences pertaining to homosexuality in the NT up until 1962. \nThe first gay, Indigenous MLA in the NT, 29-year-old Chansey Paech, said wiping the convictions in the Territory is more complex than other jurisdictions. \nThe NT up until 1978 was under the control of the Federal Government. \n\"A lot of those charges are pre-1978, so it's working through how we deal with that because there's a potential we need to deal with federal bodies to look at overturning those particular cases,\" he said. \nHe told Hack he will lobby the NT government to expunge convictions for consensual gay sex. \n\"Changing this sends a message to our young people that people had to fight for those in our community now to have basic rights, and this is a demonstration of how people were treated and how their rights were not seen as equal,\" he said. \n\"It's something we need to move on...it's a conversation I'm intending to have very soon with our Attorney General.\" \nHe said it was about righting wrongs. \n\"We talk about gay marriage and we talk about same sex adoption and we advocate and we lobby, I think that making sure these charges are wiped is just as important because we need to fix and reconcile some things of our past,\" he said. \nHack has contacted the Attorney General's office for comment. \nUpdate: Since publication, the NT Government has said it is now seeking advice on expunging gay sex convictions. \nA spokesperson said \"every Territorian has a right to dignity and respect.\" Facebook Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:37:25.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
