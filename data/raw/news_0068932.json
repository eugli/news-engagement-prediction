In a brief filed Thursday, the state outlined its argument for appealing that ruling. \nAttorney General Curtis Hill said in a statement Friday that the court's decision is contradictory to state law — which mandates that the only sources of legal parentage in Indiana are biological or adoptive — and that the appeal wishes to clarify parental rights for all Hoosiers. \n\"In this particular case, the federal district court suggests there is a third source — a marital relationship with a legal parent,\" Hill said in the statement. \"The fundamental problem with this decision is that Indiana statutes do not in fact bestow parental rights based on the mere fact of a marital relationship. This is true for both opposite- and same-sex couples.\" \n[ Read the full text of the state's opening brief ] \nIn 2015, eight lesbian couples challenged Indiana laws that allowed only a mother and a father to be named as parents on a child's birth certificate — meaning only the birth mother was listed on the birth certificate. \nU.S. District Court Judge Tanya Walton Pratt ruled in their favor in June 2016 , ruling the laws are in violation of the equal protection provided under the 14th Amendment. \nPrior to the ruling, and in accordance with Indiana law, children born to same-sex couples were considered born out of wedlock. In order to receive parental rights, a same-sex spouse would then have to legally adopt the child. \nThe women argued the birth certificate issue could have created obstacles for families enrolling their child in school, making medical decisions or claiming the child as a dependent on insurance and taxes. \nPratt said in her judgment that the recognition of these rights fell under those that needed to be extended to same-sex couples following the 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriages nationwide. \nThe state's opening brief argues the 14th Amendment does not constitutionally guarantee a person's parental rights. \n\"No one disputes that the married couples who are plaintiffs in this case may, and indeed should, ultimately have joint parentage of the children born to their marriages,\" the brief reads. \"But, given that one member of each couple is not biologically related to the children born to them, the question is how that nonbiological parent may acquire parental rights: Must she adopt, or does the 14th Amendment guarantee parental rights through marriage? \n\"The answer: Only a biological relationship confers constitutional parental rights, and in all other cases, the state may require would-be parents to adopt so that a court may account for the rights of others and determine the best interests of the child.\" \nThe Indiana Office of the Attorney General had announced it would appeal the ruling in January . The appeal has been filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. \nIndyStar reporter Stephanie Wang contributed to this story. \nCall IndyStar reporter Holly Hays at (317) 444-6156.
