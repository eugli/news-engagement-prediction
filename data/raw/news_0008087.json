That could be about to change.\nPlymouth City Council are discussing plans to introduce an optional £40 a year charge for Blue Badge holders. They will need to pay this fee if they want free use of council carparks.\nCredit: ITV News Like many people with a disability, Bruce Abbott says his car gives him a freedom that many without a disability take for granted. Until now, thanks to his Disabled Persons Blue Badge, he's been able to park in most of Plymouth's Council run carparks for free.\nHowever, the City Council is now debating plans to charge blue badge holders an optional £40 a year to then entitle them to free parking in carparks.\nBruce said, \"What we are unhappy with is they haven't given it the right amount of thought, they haven't properly engaged with us, they haven't considered the variability of disability and that is what worries us as people with disabilities.\"\nBruce Abott Credit: ITV News Now one of the areas that won't be affected by the new charge is on street parking. The changes will only affect council run car parks.\"\nAnn Pointon, Chair of Plymouth Area Disabled Access Network, says one of the major flaws in the proposals is that the new £40 permit would be registered to one vehicle. This means if you then travel in a different car, you will still have to pay for parking.\nShe said, \"Because there is a real problem, once it's associated with one particular vehicle how do you manage if there is something unexpected or you've never had a vehicle to start with or your son and daughter, there might be several cars in one family that a person might be using to get out and about.\"\nCredit: ITV News Plymouth City Council have responded to people's concerns by issuing the following statement:\n\"We are consulting on a number of proposals aimed at simplifying our different tariffs\"\n\"We had proposed to restrict the permit to one vehicle but some people feel they should be able to use it in different vehicles and we will consider this feedback\"\n\"No decisions have yet been made and people have until Thursday 9 February to share their views.\"\n Plymouth Parking", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:02:39.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
