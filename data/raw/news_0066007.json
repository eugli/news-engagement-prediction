I would say all of them,\" states Annie Duke, professional poker player and author of the book Annie Duke: How I Raised, Folded, Bluffed, Flirted, Cursed, and Won Millions at the World Series of Poker . \"What basically happens is that you really can see in a very magnified way [how] our irrationalities play into our decision-making.\"\nDuke, who won the 2004 World Series of Poker Tournament, double-majored in English and psychology at Columbia University and studied cognitive linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania. And she is the author of several poker instruction books that teach game theory and the importance of probabilistic thinking.\n\"The problem is once we've formed a belief—which we haven't vetted really well—we notice information that reinforces this belief. We don't notice information that discounts it,\" says Duke. \"What would happen instead if we had a belief and we were forced to think about it as a bet? It would force us into thinking about probability.\"\nDuke sat down with Nick Gillespie at Reason Weekend 2016 , an annual donor event for the nonprofit that publishes Reason.com and Reason magazine, and discussed game theory, life lessons learned from poker, the importance of being belief updaters, and her experience with Donald Trump on 2009's Celebrity Apprentice .\n\"In a weird way, Trump is actually an amazing behavioral scientist,\" says Duke. \"He understands intuitively—I think—something very deep about the way we form beliefs and what people want to hear back in regards to our beliefs.\"\nApproximately 43 minutes.\nProduced by Nick Gillespie.
