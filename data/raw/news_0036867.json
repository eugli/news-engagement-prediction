However, Corbyn’s ratings as a Labour opposition leader almost 18 months in are closer to Michael Foot’s.\" \nLabour insiders are increasingly pessimistic about losing the Copeland by-election, which was triggered by the resignation of backbencher Jamie Reed. \nThe Prime Minister visited the constituency this week, amid growing confidence from the Conservatives that they stand a chance of winning the seat. \nLabour is facing allegations of “dirty tricks” after warning voters in the seat that a Tory victory will \"cost mums their children\". \nIt follows another leaflet which this week claimed that cuts to maternity services at a local hospital will mean \"mothers will die, babies will die, babies will be brain-damaged\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:23:04.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
