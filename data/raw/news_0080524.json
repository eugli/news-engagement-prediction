The original featured a song by 10-year-old Sreya Jayadeep from Kozhikode, Kerala, called Yenno Njanente.\nFor the team of JJJ, it made perfect sense to have Sreya sing the Kannada version as well. Composed by Arjun Janya, the song, that starts off with ‘Onde Thaayi Makkalu’, has been picturized on an eight-year-old who sings about communal harmony. Speaking about the experience, Sreya’s mother Praseetha says, “When the offer for the Kannada song came, we were unsure because of the language barrier. But the team sent us the Kannada lyrics in English, and insisted that we record the song and send it across the same day. We did, and Arjun liked it. When we were in Bengaluru recently for the song recording, Arjun patiently worked on her diction. Sreya liked the song a lot and adapted fast. It has come out very well.”\nThe teaser for JJJ’s audio track, which will include sound bytes from the stars, as well as audio-visuals from the five songs, will be out today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:48:46.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
