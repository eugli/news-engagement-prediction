Remember this from Game 7? \nThat broke an 89-89 tie and helped the Cavaliers take home the title. As you saw, it was literally the same exact dribble move that led to the spot-up three from nearly the same spot on the court. \nOn the night, Irving oddly-enough struggled shooting the ball, going 8-of-24 for 23 points along with five assists. However, when it mattered most, he came through in the clutch in what was a very meaningful regular season game that might have long-lasting implications in the Eastern Conference.
