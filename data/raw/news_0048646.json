(Photo: Cheryl Evans/The Republic) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nRoadwork is underway on a controversial 22-mile extension of Loop 202 that will connect the West Valley and southeast valley, bypassing downtown Phoenix. \nThe South Mountain Freeway will connect Interstate 10 in Chandler to I-10 in west Phoenix. The freeway will follow Pecos Road through Ahwatukee and head north near 59th Avenue through Laveen. \nConstruction of the new freeway is in full swing despite legal challenges to the project in 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Gila River Indian Community and environmental and community groups argue that transportation agencies did not adequately address the freeway’s effects on cultural and natural resources, as well as health impacts on neighboring communities. \nA Phoenix-based U.S. District judge ruled in August that the project can proceed , but those findings were appealed. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied injunctions to halt the project last month, but the appeals court could still block the freeway. South Mountain Freeway stories Judge refuses to block freeway \nThe freeway is expected to open in late 2019 with four lanes in each direction, three general-use lanes and one HOV lane. \nThe freeway's path will include 13 new traffic interchanges and 40 bridges, according to Dustin Krugel, spokesman for the Arizona Department of Transportation. \nThe corridor's $916 million design and construction contract makes it Arizona’s largest highway project, according to the ADOT. \nHere is the construction work that is underway in parts of the Valley.
