Let's improve options & outcomes for all US students.\n— Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVos) February 7, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist from Michigan and staunch Trump supporter, emerged as arguably the most divisive of President Trump's cabinet picks. She's a strong proponent of school choice , meaning the government should give parents and guardians vouchers to choose which school (public, private, or otherwise) to send their kids. Critics have pointed out that this approach would effectively gut funding for public schools and restore systemic segregation in America's education system.\nThe approach has even rankled some Trump supporters, according to The New York Times , many of whom are from rural areas where a single public school is the only feasible option for parents.\nDuring her confirmation hearings, DeVos stumbled on a few key questions, including federal funding for students with disability.

But Democrats failed to persuade other Republican lawmakers to cross the aisle.\nThe evening before the vote, Democrats held the Senate floor for 24 hours as a sign of protest.
