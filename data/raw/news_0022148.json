This latest information comes from a new report out of VentureBeat which credits seen marketing materials on the new smartwatch. \nUnfortunately, further details on the upcoming smartwatch from ZTE are very limited as the marketing materials are said to have been in an early stage when seen. As a result, what the ZTE Quartz will offer is still largely unknown. However, one aspect which does seem extremely likely is that this smartwatch will be LTE-enabled as other reports came through only last month confirming that ZTE is working on an LTE-enabled Android Wear smartwatch. Likewise, it is reported that this smartwatch has now passed through the Bluetooth SIG process and is going by the model number ZW10. While there is no confirmation on this, the assumption being made is that the ZTE Quartz could be unveiled at this year’s MWC event in Barcelona. That is not to say that the smartwatch will become available anytime soon though. If the marketing materials are recent materials, then their limited details would suggest that the ZTE Quartz is not quite ready for market consumption yet. \nInterestingly, this news does come just ahead of an event which is due to take place within the next couple of days where two new smartwatches will be unveiled by Google and LG . These are the LG Watch Sport and Style and among other things, are expected to be the first smartwatches to come running on Android Wear 2.0. As a result, it does stand to reason that if ZTE is preparing to launch the ZTE Quartz soon enough, then there is every reason to assume that the ZTE Quartz will also come running on Android Wear 2.0. Although, until more firmer details come through on this new smartwatch from ZTE, the specs and operating system version assumptions do remain as just assumptions. In either case, the image shown above is said to be of the ZTE Quartz and does certainly seem to be confirming the employment of a round watch face design.
