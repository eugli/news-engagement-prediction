They asked people to “send positivity to Alex while patiently and excitedly awaiting her return.” \nThe group has been actively promoting “Make Me Ah,” which is originally a b-side track off of their most recent album “Start a Fire.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:57:08.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
