New observations from NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope led to the latest discovery. \n“The seven wonders of TRAPPIST-1 are the first Earth-size planets that have been found orbiting this kind of star,” Michael Gillon, lead author of the paper published Wednesday and the principal investigator of the TRAPPIST exoplanet survey at the University of Liege, Belgium, said in a statement. \n“It is also the best target yet for studying the atmospheres of potentially habitable, Earth-size worlds.” NASA \nThis illustration shows the possible surface of TRAPPIST-1f, one of the newly discovered planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system Andy Rosen can be reached at .
