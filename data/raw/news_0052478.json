They utilize channels of the spectrum untapped by most routers to keep your data flowing.

Portal has come up with a method to avoid the noise by using more channels of the 5GHz WiFi spectrum than other devices. These FastLanes, as they're called, help your data move along without any neighboring interference, making them ideal for crowded environments. Plus, the onboard WiFi AutoPilot continuously monitors your network and optimizes data lanes to avoid congestion. \nA Portal WiFi router is capable of covering 3,000 square feet on its own, but since they're mesh network-capable, you can easily expand your coverage area with additional units.
