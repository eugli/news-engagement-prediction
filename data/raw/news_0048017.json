She has played a goddess on TV, been a contestant in the Kingfisher Calander Hunt, played a historical character in Jhansi Ki Rani and — as it has become necessary for any female actor these days — done films in the South\nAfter a couple of Telugu films, Ishita is now making a mark for herself in the Kannada film industry. She made her debut in Sandalwood with Mukunda Murari and is following it up with Darshan’s Chakravarthy . She spoke to Mirror about her life and career. Excerpts:\nYour acting career on television and films is progressing side by side. Which one do you like more?\nActing is about my passion and dream. I love every part of it. Doing TV helps us reach every house. Doing 70 mm is the dream of every boy and girl. We all wait for it and when it comes to us we feel special. With the medium of movies we can do some meaningful roles which can have a good impact on the society which we live in. That is why these days people love biopics. So for me acting is important (TV or movies). I love to be in a camera frame. I love acting and I am very happy to be a part of this wonderful fraternity.\nDon’t you think most female actresses in Indian films are cast just for glamour?\nFrom old movies to the new age ones, glamour has played an important part. Every actress did it. However, being glamorous does not mean it is not sensible. Movies like Ram Teri Ganga Maili and Satyam Shivam Sundaram had great sensibilities and had an impact on the society. Both the actresses in these films did glamourous roles and did it really well. It all depends on how the director presents you on screen. We are actors after all.\nYou have bagged films with big stars in Sandalwood. But do you feel the big break is eluding you? (She has acted in ‘Mukunda Murari’ and ‘Chakravarthy’)\nYes , working with superstars can be a great learning experience. I learnt a lot from them — how they interact, how to remain cool on the sets, how to work under pressure and so on. They are very creative and I learned how to be affable and sociable on sets. Getting a big break is not easy as there is a lot of competition out there. I believe in hard work, honesty, determination and karma. These are the pillars of my life. Those who have these qualities will reach their goals, sooner or later.\nHow was your childhood? Do you think you were destined to be an actor from early?\nI had a normal, happy childhood. Being the daughter of a government servant we had to relocate to several places. I got to see many places and learned many languages; which is helping me now. I always wanted to be a sportsperson and I did well, even playing at the national level in some sports. But destiny had a different plan for me and I become an actor. I came to Mumbai from Bhopal . Like other people, I also had to struggled. There was a time when I felt very restless. But I never quit and carried on. During the shooting of OMG: Oh My God, Mithunda (Mithun Chakraborty), who is my mentor, asked me to believe in myself. Never quit and work hard, he used to say. I have not looked back since then. I really want to die while working on the set. My family did not support me initially but when they saw my passion toward films, they accepted it. Now, they are proud of me.\nWhat is your role in ‘Chakravarthy’ and how was the experience in your second Kannada film?\nChakravarthy is a film close to me and one of the best experiences I have had. I did a special retro song in it and I really loved doing it. I am fortunate that after Mukunda Murari I share screen space with Darshan sir. He is one of the most humble souls I have met. He is an institution and a great human being. The team of Chakravarthy is like a family. They helped me a lot on the set. I thank each and everyone from the team. I am also grateful to Chintan sir (director). And, of course, Darshan sir for believing in me.\nHow easy or tough is it to be an actor?\nI believe every job is tough. But if we work with love it becomes very easy. Whatever we do, we must do it with dedication, respect and love. The universe will help you to get it. I follow the path of honesty and hard work and listen to my soul and work accordingly.\nAfter having acted in Kannada and Telugu, did you feel the language barrier? How good can an actor be in a language that they don’t understand?\nI really don’t think language is a barrier. It’s more important that people love and accept you. I am grateful to the Kannada film industry for accepting me. Since I did not know the language it was a bit difficult during shooting. But everyone made me feel at ease.\nAre there any other Kannada films you are working in?\nAfter Mukunda Murari and Chakravarthy I am getting lots of offers. But I want to do roles that I like and which I think people will like. I will pick roles that challenge me. I can assure you that you will see me in one more big movie very soon.\nWhat is your world beyond films and television?\nI love exploring new places. I love dancing, painting, sword fighting, horse riding and bike riding. I am religious and go to the temple every day. I connect with my fans through social media when I find time. I get new suggestions from them and implement them.", "external_links": ["http://www.speakingtree.in/topics/beliefs/darshan"], "published": "2017-02-21T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:58:55.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
