Trump's ban appeal rejected as families share emotional reunions at airports \n‘There are some in Trump’s family that have some views on these things,’ a source told Politico. ‘That’s where the decision is ultimately being made.’ \nThe new order, which was leaked earlier this week, would have also rolled back LGBT and women’s rights when it came to marriage equality, abortion, contraception and transgender rights.

Romania rolls back on corruption law after massive protests \nKushner and Ivanka Trump, however, have a record of supporting gay rights, and move in the same circles as socially progressive New Yorkers. \nIn a statement put out shortly after the order was leaked, the Trump administration said: ‘The executive order signed in 2014, which protects employees from anti-LGBTQ workplace discrimination while working for federal contractors, will remain intact at the direction of President Donald J. Trump.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T16:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T11:30:13.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
