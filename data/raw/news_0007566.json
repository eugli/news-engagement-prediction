High end desktop speaker systems are typically composed of powered monitors and a separate subwoofer. And while many of them offer exceptional sound clarity, we found them lacking in consumer-friendly features PC gamers would benefit from. That is until we tested the Klipsch R-15PM powered monitors. \nWith up to five input options including Bluetooth, USB, 3.5mm AUX, digital optical, and analog RCA / phono, the R-15PM is the most versatile set of speakers we’ve tested. A small remote allows you to plug in multiple sources at once and switch them on the fly. The built-in amplifier eliminates the need for an external DAC to help keep your desk clean and allows you to forgo the a/v receiver when used in the living room. \nOn their own, the speakers already delivered consistent robust sound in all ranges. But once we added the Klipsch R-10SW subwoofer into the equation, the R-15PM monitors quickly entered a class of their own. While passive speakers have to be paired with an external amplifier engineered to work with a multitude of speakers, the internal amp inside the R-15PM was fine-tuned for one specific model. And the optimization shows as the system produced unmatched accuracy in all of our tests. \nAt the time of writing, Klipsch is offering the R-15PM for $349 which is a steal considering we’d still recommend the set at their usual $400+ price. They aren’t the cheapest high end speakers by far, especially when you consider the cost of adding a subwoofer. But once we consider their simplicity and consumer friendly features, the R-15PM monitors are our top choice for high end PC speakers. Read More How we test speakers and others we tested \nSince our guide is called the best speakers for PC gaming, we kept the testing process simple and focused on gaming. We tested each set of speakers in-game for several hours through a wide range of games with rich soundtracks and sounds including Skyrim, Dark Souls 3, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Overwatch and Furi. Afterwards, we ran listening tests which included snippets from the film Jurassic World and a variety of albums in lossless FLAC format such as Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories and Psychic from Darkside. \nWith gaming in mind, one of the most important features to test for was left/right balance. To test this in game we used the CS: GO Audio Test Chamber workshop project by geri43. It’s a simple map that allows you to reproduce all sorts of in-game sounds including ladder movements, sniper scopes, gunfire, footsteps and more. Moving around the map or behind a wall allowed us to manipulate the location of the sounds and test how easily we could identify their direction with the speakers. Competitors \nWe put a number of speakers through their paces over the course of our testing. Here's the competitors who showed promise but weren't quite as good as our favorites. Creative Inspire T12 \nIf you’re looking for an affordable compact set of speakers, the Inspire T12 from Creative are a 2.0 set of speakers that pack a serious punch. Although the speakers include Creative’s “BassFlex” technology for improved bass response, we much preferred the A250 set with its dedicated subwoofer for PC gaming. Logitech Z313 \nEasily one of the most popular 2.1 speaker systems available, the Logitech Z313 is a solid choice for PC gaming . The included control pod makes it easy to make volume adjustments and the speakers produce balanced sound. But we found more muffled low ends in the Z313 than we did with Creative’s A250. Cyber Acoustics CA-3602 \nThe CA-3602 is definitely one of the loudest low end speakers we tested. It’s able to fill a relatively large room with balanced sound but falls short in clarity at higher volume levels. Although it had the largest subwoofer in the budget bunch, the CA-3602 struggled the most with clear bass. Creative T30 / T50 Wireless \nPriced at $129.99 and $199.99, the Creative T30 and T50 Wireless 2.0 speakers are priced higher than several 2.1 sets in the mid-range but a top-located bass port offers surprisingly competitive lows. The main difference between the two is an additional driver on the T50. Both come equipped with Bluetooth and NFC capability making them great options for the house, but the lack of a subwoofer has them fall short for gaming. Klipsch Promedia 2.1 Wireless \nPriced similarly to the Harman Kardon SoundSticks Wireless, the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 Wireless are also an excellent choice for mid-range speakers. Equipped with a built-in amplifier, the speakers offer room-filling sound with a commanding low end presence. Unfortunately, the wireless USB dongle would not stay connected during our testing so we had to go with the wired AUX input. \nOverall, the Promedia 2.1 speakers performed exceptionally well but slight distortion and minor low end rumbles when listening to music left us preferring the SoundSticks. Klipsch has updated the Promedia 2.1 Wireless to include built-in Bluetooth support. The speakers no longer require a USB dongle and are now called the . Future testing \nUnlike most of the products we test here, there aren’t a whole lot of developments happening each year when it comes to speakers. That being said, we still have a long way to go before we test out all of the competitive speakers out there for PC gaming. \nAs usual, we’ll continue to update this story with new developments as we continue testing. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcomed. Some of the speakers we’re hoping to test next include options from M-Audio, Audioengine and Altec Lansing. \nSome online stores give us a small cut if you buy something through one of our links.
