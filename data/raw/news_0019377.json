Can they still get married?\" asked one user.\nOthers made reference to the Chinese tradition of adults giving money in red packets to children during the new year. \"When they give out red packets, will they start to cry?\" said one Weibo user.\n\"The youngest family members will be collecting New Year's money until their hands go weak,\" joked another commenter.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38704598", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7077/production/_94219782_53c51829-18c6-46a7-8a86-b4f4f439d27a.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2257/production/_94219780_e9cf4021-c2ee-4a29-80f0-8e04dd7060e5.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-08T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:13:28.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
