Both have sixth forms. Both were set up to serve largely white and working class communities where educational aspiration was not particularly high. Both, in recent years, have been given notice to improve by Ofsted.\nAnd yet, by dint of geography, Berwick Academy and the Harris Academy Chafford Hundred could scarcely be more different. And while the Chafford Hundred school is now rated outstanding, Berwick Academy recently received a stern letter from the inspectorate.\nStark gaps in educational achievement between north and south have been the subject of much comment recently: Sir Nick Weller, appointed to review northern education as part of the government’s “northern powerhouse” schools strategy, spoke of “ cold spots ” with high levels of deprivation, low attainment and too few good schools.\nSir Michael Wilshaw , then chief inspector of schools, said last December that if schools north of the Wash performed as well as those south of it, 160,000 more pupils would receive a good or outstanding education.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Berwick head Alexis Widdowson says staff shortages are her biggest headache. Photograph: Mark Pinder for the Guardian \nThe government has put £70m into its northern powerhouse schools strategy and is due to announce this spring new partnerships to raise standards, particularly for the poorest pupils.\nBerwick-upon-Tweed is in Northumberland, one of 10 authorities in England where fewer than 40% of secondary schools are rated good or better. Its academy is a small, unprepossessing affair built in the 1950s or thereabouts – it has just 620 pupils, including sixth formers, whereas Chafford Hundred has 1,300. Berwick’s furthest feeder school is 16 miles away, while the Essex school’s catchment extends less than half a mile.\n“It’s like the Dunkirk spirit,” says Berwick’s head, Alexis Widdowson – she used to be an investment banker and rides a Harley.\nIt’s soon clear what she’s up against: “Ask them if you can look at the library – look at the sports facilities,” she says when she learns we’re also planning to visit a southern school. “Does the headteacher have a personal assistant? That was the receptionist who just brought the tea.”\nCuts, cuts, cuts. Headteachers tell of school system ‘that could implode’ Read more \nShe says schools in the more densely populated south-east can benefit from economies of scale on functions such as human resources or payroll, and so can have more left for maintenance projects. Her school can bid for capital funding, she says, but there’s a presumption that money will go to those with serious safety issues or those that are growing – and rolls in places such as Northumberland have not risen in recent years.\nBut her biggest issue is staffing. On the stairs we pass Tracy Hush. She’s the acting assistant head in charge of English, Widdowson explains; she’s freelance and doesn’t want a permanent job. They’ve advertised the post three times since last April.\nThere isn’t much movement of staff – young recruits don’t want to live here; those who are here tend not to leave. Ofsted has complained of pockets of poor teaching quality in the school but it has to nurture the talent it’s got. And that takes time.\nChafford Hundred, meanwhile, is an impressive sight. It’s a huge, imposing academy, purpose-built just after the millennium to meet demand from new housing. It’s all light and glass. Visitors are greeted with the school motto – Excel, Exceed, Explore – in big letters.\nThe school’s head is Nicky Graham – she used to be a manager with Marks & Spencer, and arrived as head of year in 2004, three years before Ofsted’s notice to improve. But she doesn’t remember that as a negative experience: “I wouldn’t have missed it for anything. It’s probably the best professional development you can live through.”\nThe library is rather a jumble at present – there’s work going on and piles of boxes everywhere. But the sports facilities are fabulous – the academy boasts a 17-acre site with floodlit artificial turf pitches.\nRecruiting teachers isn’t an issue here – there’s plenty of movement in the jobs market and good transport links. The Harris Federation, of which the school is part, trains teachers and this year four former pupils will be trained here.\nFiona Millar: a huge injection of cash is needed before school funding can be fair Read more \nThe differences between the two schools are stark, but are they really evidence of a north-south divide? Or are the attainment gaps in the education system – eight out of 10 schools south of the Wash are rated good or outstanding compared to seven out of 10 north of it – really related to other factors? Some have argued geographical isolation and white working class underachievement can account for them.\nThose who believe in the northern powerhouse point to the London challenge programme, which saw big strides in achievement. Others say growing ethnic diversity has been the key to that success.\nBut Sir Nick Weller, the government’s northern powerhouse strategist and chief executive of Dixons Academies in Bradford, believes there’s a definite difference between the performance of disadvantaged children in the north and in the south, regardless of social or geographic factors. “When you used to go into a London school, one of the first things you were told was how many languages were spoken. Fifteen years ago that was a reason for failure, now it’s the reason why it’s so easy to teach in London,” he says.\nHe believes equal success is possible in the north. The keys are better links between schools – he feels chains such as Harris or Dixons can offer both support and economies of scale – and a drive to attract the best teachers: “I say to councillors they should stop trying to sell the north on the basis of the Brontës and sheep. They have to persuade people there’s a moral purpose – you have to play on their idealism.”\nAnd strategies are being devised that could help to bring some of that sense of idealism and joint enterprise – seen as major factors in London’s success – to the north. Among those bidding to play a part is Sheffield Hallam University, which has drawn up a plan to help recruit and retain high-quality new teachers for South Yorkshire. Prof Samantha Twiselton, director of the Sheffield Institute of Education, based at Hallam, believes partnerships with universities at their centre could take on part of the role once played by local authorities.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chafford Hundred head Nicky Graham says recruiting teachers isn’t an problem at her school. Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian \nBut she doesn’t see this as a strictly north-south issue – it’s more complicated than that, she says. “I think what we’re talking about is the rest of the country, compared to London and the south-east. London schools buck the trend now, which they didn’t do 15 years ago. But there is also a correlation between areas that have a lack of teacher training provision and areas that have low attainment, for instance.”\nBack in Berwick, Widdowson is also forming alliances – she is active in a network of north-east schools. As head of a standalone academy without backup from either a local authority or chain, she says this provides invaluable support.\nBut like many others, she bridles at the notion that there’s a north-south divide characterised by underachievement – or even that schools in the north need to be more like those in the south. She thinks the government’s priorities are London-centric: “The government assumes a career involves politics, journalism, law or accounting. Here the major opportunities are in travel and tourism, agriculture and horticulture, forestry, conservation,” she says.\n“If a child wants to be a lawyer it’s my job to facilitate that – but what I dislike is the lack of respect for difference.\n“The kids who want to be electricians or plumbers have no value because they have no place in the education system; to me that is totally,totally wrong. If in 20 years you interviewed those people and they felt bonded with their community, and felt they’d brought their children up in a safe, secure environment, and they’d saved for their pension, what on earth is wrong with that? What’s success?\n“If every child goes to university and no child ever comes back, it’s like the pied piper of Hamlyn. Where would the future of this community be then?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:31:56.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
