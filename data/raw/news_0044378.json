The star of this video is Florian “Venom” Kohler, a French legend when it comes to trick-shot pool. All the shots are incredible, like every Dude Perfect video — but some of these are out of this world. Breaking clay pigeons covering crotches. Popping the ball up and shooting it off a balcony into a golf hole. But perhaps most jaw-dropping is jumping a ball over two tables and sinking six balls shaped in a butterfly. This is all so good. After the trick-shot extravaganza, Kohler hung around and played a game of pool like it was air hockey. This is very excellent.
