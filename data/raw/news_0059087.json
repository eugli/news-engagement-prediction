Additionally, people are 19% more likely to feel like they’ve reached a resolution and 22% more likely to be satisfied compared to those who had impersonal interactions with a business on Twitter.”\nProviding a face, as opposed to logo, will also help users better understand when they’re communicating with a person, as opposed to a bot. As noted by Marketing Land , there have been reported problems with bot interactions, with some users being confused as to which elements are automated , with customer service agents crossing wires with bot responses. By providing a representation of who, exactly, you’re speaking with, it could improve the communication process and eliminate any such kinks.\nAnd Twitter also highlights another potential use case:\n“ While T-Mobile uses custom profiles to highlight the human aspect of their service, custom profiles also create the opportunity for businesses to add personality to automated experiences by incorporating real or fictional characters.”\nSo there’s that too. Not sure how valuable that might be, but it is another option to consider.\nIn order to enable the new custom profiles option, brands need to fill out the form here to register their interest.
