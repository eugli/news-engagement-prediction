(Photo: Joe Maiorana-USA TODAY Sports) \nJim Harbaugh took to Twitter on Thursday night to let everyone know how he really feels about who I assume is Paul Finebaum, though Harbaugh calls him Pete (maybe because he was so mad he didn't notice or maybe because he wanted to do that thing where you call someone by the wrong name on purpose to annoy them). Pete Finebaum, the unabashed SEC water carrier, really needs to get his facts straight. #AlternativeFacts — Coach Harbaugh (@CoachJim4UM) February 17, 2017 \nThe Michigan coach says the ESPN host is an \"unabashed SEC water carrier\" and that he \"really needs to get his facts straight,\" and he tosses in an \"alternative facts\" hashtag. \nThese two have had Twitter spats before. Finebaum has even called Harbaugh \"the Donald Trump of college football.\" \nFinebaum said of the hire : \n\"This is wrong. It may not be illegal of NCAA standards and bylaws as of this moment, but to me it's cheating. It's blatantly disregarding the spirit of the NCAA rules. We all know why (Jim Harbaugh's) doing it. And this is the same person who last year accused Nick Saban of cheating, he accused Hugh Freeze of cheating, and in my mind, and I know you can't prove it and he won't be penalized for it, but he's cheating … I don't know why the media celebrates Jim Harbaugh for disregarding the NCAA rulebook and doing things that in my mind are unethical.\" \nWhatever Harbaugh is mad about, he got his point across: He does not like Finebaum at all.
