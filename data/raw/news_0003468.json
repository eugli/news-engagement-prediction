Oculus and Luckey are both responsible for $50 million for misrepresenting the origin of a product. \nFormer CEO Brendan Iribe -- who now leads a PC VR division within Facebook -- must also pay $150 million. \nOculus plans to appeal the ruling. \nRelated: Zuckerberg lays out Oculus' long-term VR plans The Oculus Rift headset. \n\"The heart of this case was about whether Oculus stole ZeniMax's trade secrets, and the jury found decisively in our favor,\" an Oculus spokeswoman said in a statement to CNNTech. \"We're obviously disappointed by a few other aspects of today's verdict, but we are undeterred.\" \nShe continued: \"Oculus products are built with Oculus technology. Our commitment to the long-term success of VR remains the same, and the entire team will continue the work they've done since day one, developing VR technology that will transform the way people interact and communicate.\" \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified during the weeks-long trial, marking his first court appearance. \n\"We are highly confident that Oculus products are built on Oculus technology,\" Zuckerberg said during his testimony. \"The idea that Oculus products are based on someone else's technology is just wrong.\" \nThe company's stock was unaffected by the news on Wednesday.
