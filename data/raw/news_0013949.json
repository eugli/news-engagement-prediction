Pontus Jansson and Elias Kachunga were picked out for cautions by Hooper. \nThis was the most keenly anticipated West Yorkshire derby in years, with both clubs well established in the promotion equation. Indeed, both have opened their doors to Premier League delegation visits in recent weeks for an assessment of facilities in anticipation of status upgrades. \nEach came into it buoyed by midweek victories that kept them within striking distance of the top two with just over a third of the season to play. In the wake of his dramatic, late headed winner at Blackburn, Leeds’ Sweden international defender Pontus Jansson spoke of his belief that he will be featuring for new parent club - the £3.5m deal to make his loan deal from Torino permanent was formalised on Thursday – in the English top-flight soon. \nWagner’s Huddersfield were equally full of confidence, having refound form following an autumnal dip. Just one defeat in 12 previous matches, and with January’s attacking acquisitions simply adding to the enthusiasm of John Smith’s Stadium regulars - “No Wagner, no party” has become a slogan in the stands - this was another chance to derail a top-six opponent. \nFor Huddersfield, German striker Collin Quaner made his first league start since a £500,000 switch from Union Berlin last month, with Kasey Palmer, one of the Yorkshire club’s two Chelsea loanees, also recalled. That meant Izzy Brown, the other borrowed from the Bridge, and Nahki Wells – in the team that terrorised Brighton on Thursday evening – dropped to the bench. \nThat victory was the first time Huddersfield had scored three goals in a league match since the 4-1 win at Elland Road 11 months ago. And they created plenty of chances once again, overcoming the loss of Palmer, moments after his twinkle toes had teed up Quaner for a left-foot drive that Leeds goalkeeper Rob Green beat away. \nWithin two minutes of entering the action, however, Brown - whose loan spell at Rotherham this season caught the eyes of better-placed suitors – put the home team in front with a high-class finish. \nAtoning for team-mate Gaetano Berardi’s mistake, Jansson produced a precision slide tackle to dispossess the surging Elias Kachunga on the edge of the Leeds penalty area. Hauling himself back to his feet, the Swede was pipped to the loose ball by Huddersfield captain Tommy Smith, whose instinctive cross was flashed first time into the top corner by the substitute. \nIt was tough on the combative Jansson - who a minute had his heart in his mouth when an attempted square pass struck Quaner, ballooned over the stranded Green, and landed on the rear of the net. \nBut in Chris Wood, Leeds have the division’s in-form forward, and he pulled them level with the second of the two chances they created in the opening 45 minutes. Having forced Danny Ward into the first save of the contest in the fourth minute, from an angled drive, Wood converted a much simpler chance 10 minutes before half-time. \nPablo Hernandez, one of three changes designed to refresh Leeds, delivered a free-kick, Kyle Bartley won the aerial challenge, and the New Zealander poked beyond the advancing Ward to score for the seventh time in 2017, walking the ball over the line to a crescendo of boos from a home support aggrieved at the lack of an offside flag. They were wrong; the linesman right. \nTheir team’s response was much more impressive: in the space of the next three minutes, it took a brave block at the back post from Berardi to keep out Kachunga’s checked volley, Green rushed from his goalline to repel Quaner’s attempted clip over him, and Michael Hefele headed an Aaron Mooy corner narrowly wide. \nHuddersfield continued to dominate after the interval too. Van la Parra’s toes were not long enough to make a connection with a low centre, with the Leeds net exposed, while Quaner appeared to have too much time to think about Brown’s quirky dink over the top, controlling the ball on his chest, and producing an air volley on the turn with just Green to beat. Late on, nobody in blue and white stripes anticipated defender Christopher Schindler’s inviting low centre and it skipped past the post. \nNevertheless, with the 21-goal Wood in the opposition ranks, they had to be on their mettle at the other end. \nNot least when substitute Alfonso Pedraza, on loan from Villarreal, marked his debut with a mazy dribble that concluded with a fierce drive Ward pushed aside. \nBut for all their creativity, it was the ugliest of winners that settled things.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T16:19:09.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
