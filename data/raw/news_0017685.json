Our borough is now home to nine families and we hope to welcome more people throughout the year. \nYana, 20, fled Syria in 2013 when her brother was imprisoned and her house destroyed. The youngest of six siblings who have been scattered around the globe by the conflict, Yana has settled in well in Islington. She recently passed her first accountancy exams and her English has blossomed as she has made friends, including in a Red Cross-run choir she recently joined. Stories such as these are a testament to the contribution they’ve made to our community and evidence of a smooth transition into our borough. I work with child refugees in Calais. Theresa May’s deception is a cruel act | Benny Hunter Read more \nYet issues remain that have made the process of resettlement harder than it needs to be, particularly the Home Office’s insistence that those who have arrived under the government’s Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) be granted five-year humanitarian protection visas instead of typical refugee status, which affords people the ability to travel and access to student finance as well as to some social security support. \nThis seemingly insignificant administrative matter is the cause of great distress to the families we have welcomed. As grantees of humanitarian protection, those who have arrived under the Syrian VPRS scheme are not entitled to a UN travel document. Instead, they must either use their own passport or apply for a certificate of travel. At £218 per person, this is unaffordable for many of those who only recently escaped a horrific civil war that is still ongoing. \nThe matter is compounded by the fact that many countries – including Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Egypt – do not accept such a document or are very unlikely to. The Home Office has told us of a case in which at least one family obtained these documents only to be subsequently turned away as they attempted to travel. This seemingly insignificant administrative matter is the cause of great distress to families Kaya Comer-Schwarz \nAs for their own passports, of the nine Islington families, only three have valid Syrian documentation; one family’s passports expire shortly. Many have close family – children, parents and siblings – in Europe and around Syria. To make matters worse, help with family reunion is now outside the scope of legal aid, like so many other issues. The inability to travel to see relatives is proving to be seriously distressing to these families. In some cases, it is preventing us from effectively supporting them to integrate. \nLate last year we urged the Home Office to reconsider this disparity between the two definitions. We are not alone in doing so: recently the Commons Public Accounts Committee made similar calls in its report on the VPRS scheme , pointing out that granting humanitarian protection rather than refugee status risked people missing out on access to some public services \nIt would greatly assist us in providing the best support to families, without incurring additional costs, if refugee status were granted through a fast-track process set up in consultation with experts on asylum law and policy.

We are extremely grateful to them. \nA small but significant shift by the Home Office would do much to help that tradition continue – here and across the country. \nCllr Kaya Comer-Schwartz is executive member for community development at Islington Council \nSome names have been changed. \nTalk to us on Twitter via @Guardianpublic and sign up for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T13:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T08:54:08.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
