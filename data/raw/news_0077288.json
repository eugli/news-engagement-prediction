PAUL, Minn. — Minnesota Wild forwards Zach Parise and Jason Pominville have been diagnosed with mumps and must miss at least three games. \nThe Wild announced Monday, shortly before faceoff against Los Angeles, that Parise and Pominville have the highly contagious virus along with other members of the organization. The veteran wings have been placed in isolation for a five-day period, meaning they’ll at least miss games Tuesday at Winnipeg and Thursday at Columbus. \nThe Wild said players and staff were recently provided with a measles-mumps-rubella vaccination. \nVancouver played Saturday night without five players because of the mumps or symptoms associated with the virus. \nWith Parise and Pominville out, forwards Martin Hanzal and Ryan White made their well-timed debuts Monday after being acquired Sunday in a trade with Arizona. 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:08:22.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
