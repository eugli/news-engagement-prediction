I thought she's just following the trend. It all started back in 1991, who can forget, Demi Moore posed on the cover of Vanity Fair. That was stylish, and now it's come down to a cheap bit of net curtain on your head and a load of economy flowers and that dodgy bra.\" \nThe 35-year-old Halo singer - who already has daughter Blue Ivy with the rapper - made the shock announcement on Wednesday posting a stunning portrait of her baby bump on Instagram as she shared the touching news with fans. \n\"We would like to share our love and happiness,\" she wrote in a statement on the social media site.
