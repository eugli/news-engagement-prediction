Who'd be the fifth? Maybe Westbrook. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:09 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:09 p.m. ET \nAt some point during Sunday's NBA All-Star Game, Western Conference coach Steve Kerr will probably have all four of his Golden State All-Stars on the floor. \nBut who would be the fifth player in that lineup? Well, Kerr was a bit coy when asked by ESPN Thursday, but he didn't rule out Russell Westbrook despite the Thunder guard's strained relationship with former teammate Kevin Durant. \nMORE: All you need to know about the NBA All-Star Weekend \n\"I've definitely considered it,\" Kerr said on ESPN Radio . \"The only thing that you have to do as a coach in the All-Star Game is to parcel out the minutes. That's it. You don't draw up any plays. At least I don't; I didn't two years ago. \n\"So we've got to figure out the minutes and I have thought about it and I'm not going to share it with you here (Thursday).\" \nDurant upset many in Oklahoma City when he sent ripples through the league in July by leaving the Thunder franchise after nine seasons to sign with the Warriors as a free agent. \nDurant is averaging 25.8 points, 8.3 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game this season and was selected as a starter for the All-Star Game. The other Western Conference starters are Warriors guard Stephen Curry, Rockets guard James Harden, Pelicans forward Anthony Davis and Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard. \nDuring the same interview, which will air Saturday, Durant said he hasn't thought much about whether he and Westbrook would be on the court together. \n\"I know that's the million-dollar question,\" Durant said. \"Whoever he throws out there, man, I'm sure it'll be fun.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:28:01.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
