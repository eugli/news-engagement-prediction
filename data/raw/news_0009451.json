By Jacob Bogage By Jacob Bogage February 3 at 12:01 PM Follow jacobbogage Georgetown Visitation forward Maeve Carroll has taken on a greater scoring role for the Cubs in her senior season. (Doug Kapustin / For The Washington Post) \nMaeve Carroll has gotten used to finding 15 points hidden somewhere over the course of a game. Georgetown Visitation Coach Mike McCarthy pulls her over to the side in practice to tell her as much. If the Cubs are going to rack up big wins, win an 11th Independent School League AA division title in a row, they’ll need that offensive output from Carroll, a four-year starter and the team’s undisputed heartbeat. \nShe’s started realizing that herself after Visitation had its conference win streak snapped at 55 games against Holy Child last month. Carroll had 13 points. She didn’t immediately look for her shot, she said. After the game, the clock in her head winding down her senior year sped up. A game prior, she’d passed 1,000 career points. \nTime to turn it on, McCarthy told her. \nCarroll arrived at Visitation as a scrappy power forward, but not so much a scorer. She was a rebounder and passer who found a few layups a game on offensive rebounds and on the fast break. But after a pair of injuries last season, McCarthy started putting her in positions to score. Her father talked to her after games to remind her to shoot the ball. \nTaking more shots isn’t selfish, he said. Your team needs you. \n“This year, I know that to win, I need to do that,” she said. \nCarroll has worked on her jump shot to go along with her inside game. First it was 15-footers, but her range has steadily increased to where she’s comfortable from three-point range. \nCollege coaches want to see more of that side of her game. She’s received lots of interest from Division II and Division III teams while waiting for Division I offers from Ivy and Patriot league schools to come. Coaches tell her that at 5-foot-10, she projects as a small forward in the college game, but a small forward who will still rebound and play in the post. \nThose are confusing directives, Carroll said. \n“I’ve been doing this my whole life, playing against girls bigger than me my whole life and beating them,” she said. \nDon’t worry about her height, McCarthy tells college scouts. No matter who she goes up against, she makes plays. \n“There’s so many little things she does that are so valuable,” he said. “She’s a winner.” \nFOR YOUR CALENDAR: Feb. 11 \nThe District of Columbia State Athletic Association is hosting the DC National Girls and Women in Sports Day Expo on Saturday, Feb. 11, at Deanwood Recreation Center, 1350 49 th Street NE. \nThe Expo begins at 10:30 a.m. and runs until 4 p.m. Admission is free and no registration is necessary.
