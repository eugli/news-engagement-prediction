Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly explained Monday the purpose of the order is it “ allows us to better review the existing refugee and visa vetting system.” \n  Bush’s Daughter Sends Message About Trump’s Immigration Ban: ‘This Is Not The America I Know’ Evangelical Leader Picked To Lead Trump’s College Reform Panel Mark Cuban Advises Democrats Not To Block Trump’s Supreme Court Pick He emphasized that it is “not a ban on Muslims,” a point Trump also made clear .\nThe New York Times piece reinforced the administration’s claim by noting there is a significant Iraqi Christian population in Southern California whose friends and relatives living in Iraq are covered by the order.\nChaldean Christians make up the vast majority of the approximately 28,000 Iraqi immigrants in the town of El Cajon, near San Diego.\n \n“Many arrived during the Iraq War, and another wave came as ISIS persecuted Christians in Iraq,” The Times reported.\nThe community was not pleased with the Obama administration because of the preference it gave, in effect, to Muslim war refugees immigrating from Iraq, according to Noori Barka, who runs a Chaldean language news outlet.\nThey are hoping to fare better under Trump and, in fact, voted for him in significant numbers.\nNonetheless, Barka told The Times that he supports Trump’s temporary ban on visas and refugees. “I think it’s a good idea to stop the program and look at it more carefully,” he said. \n  Trump Honors Scalia’s Widow As He Nominates Scalia’s Successor After Suspension For Attacking Conway, Philly Anchor Makes Another Inappropriate Comment Trump Cancels Signing Of Cybersecurity Executive Order The president, in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network last week, made clear that his administration is going to make helping persecuted Christians in the Middle East a priority.\n\n \nAsked specifically about Syrian Christians, Trump responded, “We are going to help them. They’ve been horribly treated.” \nHe continued, “Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible. And the reason that was so unfair — everybody was persecuted, in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair.” \nA Pew Research Center study found that the U.S. admitted a record 39,000 Muslim refugees in fiscal year 2016, accounting for nearly half the refugee total. The second-largest religion represented was Christian at 37,500. \nHowever, of the Syrians granted refugee status last year, 99 percent were Muslim and less than 1 percent Christian. Nearly 8 percent of the population is Christian.\nEighty percent of the refugees from Iraq were Muslim.\nWhat do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:55:52.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
