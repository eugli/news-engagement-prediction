Racists now call themselves \"racialists.\" White supremacists now call themselves \"white nationalists.\" The paranoid fringe now calls itself \"alt-right,\"' she said.\n'But the hate burns just as brights,' she added.\nBannon was also featured in a Clinton campaign attack ad, which also featured imagery of the KKK.\nAt the time, team Trump fought back, with a campaign surrogate calling the video 'repulsive' and 'revolting.'\nA week after the election, Breitbart News Network threatened to sue a 'major media company' for calling it a 'white nationalist website.'\nThere's no evidence that the media company took legal action after the initial threat.", "external_links": ["http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/08/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-alt-right-breitbart-news", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-03T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:13:32.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
