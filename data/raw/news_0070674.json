ET sat down exclusively with Tarek on Friday, when he opened up about everything from Christina's relationship with contractor Gary Anderson , the ups and downs of working together while going through a divorce as well as where their relationship stands today. Tarek says he learned about Christina and Gary's recent split through the internet, at the same time as everybody else. \"I found out from the internet, you know? I do not ask personal questions,\" Tarek tells ET's Nischelle Turner, revealing that he and Christina never discussed it. \"I do not want to get involved. The best thing for me is to focus on myself, and not worry what she is doing. So, the only reason I found out about the split is because it came out in the media.\" WATCH: 'Flip or Flop' Star Christina El Moussa Splits From Gary Anderson, Is 'Taking Time to Focus on Her Children' The 35-year-old reality star admits it was hard for him to deal with Christina dating Gary. Gary remodeled the former couple's backyard, and according to police reports , was a witness to Tarek and Christina's big blow-up this past May, when police showed up to the couple's home upon receiving a call of a \"possibly suicidal male with a gun.\" \"You know, it just took a lot of strength, and it is one of those things where you have to stay positive, stay strong, focus on the kids and just not think about it,\" Tarek shares about how he initially dealt with Christina's new relationship after their split. Clearly, Tarek still has deep respect for 33-year-old Christina, whom he calls a \"great mom\" to their two children -- 6-year-old Taylor and 1-year-old Brayden. He says the two are still \"great friends,\" and doesn't shut out the possibility of them ever getting back together again. \"Maybe, like, 10 years from now,\" Tarek muses. \"Honestly, it took a lot of work to get to a good place for both of us, that I think we are at the point where we aren't looking back, we are looking towards our future.\" \"I don't know where the future is going to take me, but you never know,\" he adds. Tarek still has great memories of his relationship with Christina, and says she was his \"soul mate.\" \"You know, we just had chemistry,\" he recalls. \"If I look back, we were absolute best friends, we were soul mates. We were arm in arm and for many, many years, we were the couple that other couples would be jealous of. All the married friends would say, 'Man, you guys are the best, you get along so well,' and over time, it just started to fade.\" These days, Tarek and Christina are focusing on co-parenting and still being a family for their children. The pair has remained amicable while continuing to film Flip or Flop together , though Tarek admits it isn't always smooth sailing. \"You know, it's like anything -- there are challenges,\" Tarek acknowledges. \"There are good days, bad days, but, you know, it's our job. We love what we do, so we fight through it. We know what we have to do to support our family and continue our career.\" As for Tarek and Christina's divorce potentially getting complicated due to Tarek requesting spousal support from her in his divorce petition -- as well as requesting that she pay his lawyer fees -- Tarek says he doesn't actually want alimony from his estranged wife. \"I just checked a box, at this point, I don't have to go after any alimony,\" Tarek says. \"I mean, we do everything jointly.\" Currently, things definitely appear to be amicable between Tarek and Christina. On Thursday, the two were all smiles while filming their hit HGTV show in Garden Grove, California, sharing a laugh on set.
