MINISTER TOOK CASH FROM DEVELOPERS: READ THE FULL DOSSIER ILLEGAL donations from property developers were funnelled through NSW Multicultural Minister Ray Williams’ Hawkesbury Club, where the annual fee of $990 was just below the $1000 disclosure threshold.\nDocuments leaked to The Daily Telegraph can reveal Mr Williams — only recently promoted to the ministry by new Premier Gladys Berejiklian — took ­donations from some of Sydney’s most prominent property developers.\nThe Hawkesbury Club had formal invitations detailing the date and venue of the meeting, where a speaker would address the group.\nmedia_camera A cheque for $990 written by developer Jack Iori to pay for membership to Ray Williams’ Hawkesbury Club.\nSeveral property developers told The Daily Telegraph they were asked to be members of the club, where they would pay an annual fee of $990 and in return could attend events with a wide range of prominent political speakers.\nPremier Gladys Berejiklian has this morning asked the NSW Liberal Party to investigate Mr Williams.\n“I expect all MPs to maintain the highest standards of integrity and to comply with all relevant donations requirements,” she said.\n“Political donations are managed by the NSW Liberal Party and I have asked the Party to investigate these claims.\n“If any allegations of wrongdoing emerge, they will be referred to the NSW Electoral Commission.”\nMs Berejiklian, however, efused to say what action she will take if the Liberal Party identifies issues relating to Mr Williams, saying she does not want to discuss “any potential outcome”.\n“I’m not going to speculate on what might transpire today,” she said.\nmedia_camera .\n“I want to say straight up that as Premier of NSW I will not tolerate any wrongdoing by anyone,” she said.\nMs Berejiklian said she would be receiving an update “later in the day” and would share that update publicly.\nShe said she had spoken to Mr Williams “briefly” last night.\n“He strongly refuted the matters that were being raised,” she said.\nhe Premier said: “If there are any irregularities whatsoever, the Liberal Party will refer those matters to the relevant bodies,” she said.\nMs Berejiklian also noted that the allegations were not trivial in nature.\n“These allegations raised today are serious, no doubt about it,” she said.\nmedia_camera Premier Gladys Berejiklian has called for a probe into new minister Ray Williams. Picture: Stephen Cooper\nMr Williams issued a statement this morning denying having ever accepted an illegal donation\n“Allegations made today regarding myself are completely false and I refute them entirely,” he said in the statement.”\n“I state for the record, I have never received an illegal donation.\n“All donations made on behalf of a conference I have represented have been made directly to the Liberal Party of Australia, NSW Division as is required by law.\nProperty developer and owner of Rouse Hill Village Shopping Centre, John “Jack” Iori, who donated $990 on April 29 in 2013 confirmed to The Daily Telegraph he had many developments. This included a 10-block gated estate he developed at 32 Withers Rd in Kellyville.\nHe said he made a yearly donation of $990.\n“I get on very well with Ray. I love him. I give him $990 every year,” he said.\nmedia_camera Developer Jack Iori confirmed he made yearly donations of $990. media_camera Bruce Lyon, from Lyon Group, was asked to join the club\n“It was the Hawkesbury Club. I get invited to go and if you belong to the club, anybody will tell ya, you get ­invited to a few nights out and it’s very interesting. Knowledgeable, in other words.”\nProminent property developer Bruce Lyon, who is the founder of Lyon Group Australia, which develops commercial and residential estates, said he was invited to attend an association Mr Wil-liams set up, but to the best of his recollection he said he declined.\nHe donated a smaller sum of $134 on July 2 in 2012, which were tickets for a fundraiser.\nMr Lyon said he had only had one meeting in recent years with Mr Williams, at Parliament House, regarding a development in Dural.\n“He formed a Hawkesbury Club and someone said to me, ‘Would you like to come in?’.\n“And I do support the conservative party, (but) I didn’t have very much to do with it.\n“I’ve been in the property ­development business 60-odd years and I get annoyed with this stigma that has been put on people in the industry. We are all crooks all of a sudden,” he said.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9ca8785d59c2b186cc50efcb02d3d740?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dd16f98d70ea0557d4c8f59ee4d81e36?width=316", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/6c93fbd75143833cc298d8fb3bdeec0a?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/19b418f20a8fe0b2b0fefc80942fe1a0?width=316", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e930d01135c43e5e41429b7716b6b2e2?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3d363fa3c8a17b32a0581e824fa17e7c?width=650"], "published": "2017-02-21T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:27:01.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
