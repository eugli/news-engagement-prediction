Carol Kauffmann, also of Philadelphia, said she was going to dash over to a nearby restaurant and offer them $10 to let her use the bathroom. “It’s my birthday, and my girlfriends brought me to a fancy lunch,” she said. “I have to pee.” Most Broadway theaters were built in the early 20th century, and featured spaces where men could smoke and women could rest or touch up their makeup, but limited stalls, because women, based on the customs of the times and the complexity of their garments (corsets, anyone?), were less likely to use public toilets, theater owners say. Now, when there is a break between productions, and sometimes even while a longtime show is still running, the theater owners try to add stalls. Shubert has increased the number of women’s stalls in its houses over time to 265 from 114. Jujamcyn added 46 women’s stalls at its five houses. “It’s an issue in every theater, for every theater owner,” said Nick Scandalios, the executive vice president of Nederlander, which has nine Broadway theaters. Nederlander has just finished adding 14 stalls at the Minskoff Theater — not an easy task to pull off while the long-running “The Lion King” fills the house six days a week.

The availability and accessibility of restrooms in public spaces have become public policy issues, prompting changes in design practices and a flurry of so-called “potty parity” laws. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “This is an issue that discriminates against women, who have to spend most of the intermission waiting in line and can’t enjoy the other amenities,” said Kathryn H. Anthony , a specialist on gender-related design issues at the architecture school of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “And it’s not a pleasant way to end Act I, from a psychological point of view — having to dart to the restroom to try to avoid the line does divert your attention from what’s onstage.” The issue is forcing creative approaches. At the 1,079-seat Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, Shubert spent months digging beneath the orchestra and under an alley, even building a ramp for an excavating machine, to find space to increase the number of women’s stalls from 8 to 20. A mezzanine locker room for ushers was turned into a women’s room. The theater got permission from the city’s Buildings Department to relocate fire protection equipment to create more space, and added a staircase in the hope of reducing congestion. Jujamcyn added more women’s stalls to each of its theaters during renovations from 1990 to 2000. At the Al Hirschfeld Theater, the company switched the bathrooms, converting the large men’s room in the basement, which had a smoking lounge and a bar, into a women’s room, and remaking the upstairs women’s room, which had few stalls but many counters and mirrors for nose-powdering, into a men’s room. Some patrons, meanwhile, have resorted to creative alternatives. Carter A. Prescott, a regular theatergoer, will seek out a nearby Starbucks or a hotel bar — she likes the Crowne Plaza Times Square — in a pinch, finding it faster than lining up with fellow audience members. Inside the theater, she said: “You just see endless women, and no men of course, and then some women go into the men’s room. You don’t want to get to the point where you’re wearing Depends .” \nJoshua Barone contributed reporting.
