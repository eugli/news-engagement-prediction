Since the news surfaced, the stories surrounding the Kings organization and their blockbuster trade have continued to astonish us for all the wrong reasons.  \nRelated 5 Necessary NBA Trades Teams Are Too Scared to Make The 20 Worst Trade Deadline Deals in NBA History The 10 Craziest Trade Rumors in NBA History That Never Came to Fruition At the outset, it appears that the  New Orleans Pelicans  got over on the Kings, sending a package of  Buddy Hield , Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway, their  2017 first-round pick, and a 2017 second-rounder to Sacramento for a one-of-a-kind superstar talent in Cousins, along with Omri Casspi. Meanwhile, the main piece of Sac-Town&apos;s haul is Hield, who Kings owner Vivek Ranadive reportedly believes has \" Steph Curry potential .\" However, one look at Buddy&apos;s rookie year numbers—8.6 points per game on 39.2 percent shooting from the field—will have you wondering if Ranadive is talking about the two-time MVP or his brother Seth.  \nOn Monday, Kings general manager Vlade Divac discussed the Boogie trade, and made an alarming confession to reporters. After expressing his belief that this was the best time to pull the trigger on a deal because it was \"the best offer we had,\" Vlade was asked why he didn&apos;t hold off until a date closer to Thursday&apos;s deadline.  \"Most likely we would get less, because I had a better deal two days ago, \" Divac  said, per ESPN.  \nYikes! If you&apos;re a Kings fan, that&apos;s the last thing you want to hear. While hindsight is always 20/20, organizational mistakes like this one prove the ineptitude of Sacramento&apos;s   front office. The fact that NBA 2K17 wouldn&apos;t even approve this trade is all you need to know about how terrible this deal was.  \nThe Kings won&apos;t do this deal in NBA 2K17 pic.twitter.com/ERaK6TzVfq \n— Bryan Wiedey (@pastapadre) February 20, 2017 Send all complaints, compliments, and tips to  sportstips@complex.com . \nTags: News , Basketball , Demarcus Cousins , NBA , New Orleans Pelicans , Sacramento Kings , Vlade Divac", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:36:41.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
