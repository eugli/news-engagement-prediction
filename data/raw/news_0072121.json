Sad!” — Donald Trump, U.S. President In a comment on Twitter late Tuesday, Trump said ”liberal activists” were stirring things up for Republicans in their home bases right now.\nBut as Trump is known to be an avid watcher of Fox News, some said he could have been inspired by a program on that network.\nA report on Fox earlier on Tuesday accused Organizing for Action of directing liberals via manuals on how to “crash GOP events and increase the appearance of grassroots resistance” to Trump and his policies. The group’s Facebook page offers a link to this Congressional Recess Toolkit.

His office reportedly said that was due to the fact there was no space at a high school where he had originally intended to hold the meeting.\nBLACKSTONE, VA - The line outside of a Rep.
