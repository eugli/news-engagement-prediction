The structures, according to reports, are intended to contain long-range surface-to-air missiles. \nWashington has vocally denounced China’s island building, calling it illegal, and in January Rex Tillerson, then-nominee for Secretary of State, described the US position on Beijing by saying, \"We’re going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops and, second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.\" © Flickr/ U.S. Pacific Fleet Beijing ‘Opposes’ US Nuclear-Powered Carrier in South China Sea The White House has subsequently softened its approach, with President Donald Trump pledging to maintain the ‘One China’ policy after riling Beijing by speaking with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in December 2016. \nChina lays claim to almost all of the South China Sea’s islands and maritime; although Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, and Taiwan have claims as well.

American officials believe that the military-length airstrips already present on the islands signal a military escalation.
