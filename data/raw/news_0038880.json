Rachel Mayer is the co-founder of a New York start-up, Trigger Finance, that creates automatic trading triggers for small-time investors, based on real-world events. The company has created triggers for all sorts of market-moving signals — like changes in Federal Reserve policy and big stock price moves — but the triggers that Ms. Mayer’s company has built around Trump’s Twitter account have been by far the most popular, gaining 10,000 subscribers. Ms. Mayer, who used to be a currency trader at JPMorgan Chase, said there were a number of indications that many of her subscribers saw the tweet about Nordstrom and decided to buy the stock as a form of protest, just as many consumers said they would support the store after the president’s attack. \n  Ms. Mayer said that over time the market responses to Mr. Trump’s proclamations seemed to be more restrained, which may reflect a recognition that the president’s bark is worse than his bite. “The market doesn’t seem to think that he’s going to do anything else except complain,” she said. Trump2Cash, Mr. Braun’s bot, is set to hold the stock only until the end of the same trading day as the tweet. If the sentiment is negative, it places a short sale, or a bet that the price will fall, to take advantage of the stock going down. Mr. Braun has continually tweaked the rules governing Trump2Cash. He has, for instance, programmed the bot to ignore mentions of media companies, including The New York Times Company, because they amounted to more market noise than signal. But Mr. Braun says he will not mind if the bot ends up losing money — he is thinking about Trump2Cash as more of an art project than an investing strategy, and he plans to donate any money he makes from the few thousand dollars he has invested to Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, as a rebuke to Mr. Trump’s politics. “I have a very particular set of skills, skills that allow me to have some fun with Mr. Trump’s emotional incontinence and maybe effect positive change along the way,” Mr. Braun wrote in a Medium post introducing the bot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:27:23.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
