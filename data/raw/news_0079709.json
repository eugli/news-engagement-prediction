Slot to 247Sports Links \nHENDERSON, Nev. – The Pylon 7on7 National Championship whittled down more than 130 high school level 7on7 teams to find one champion over the course of two days. The champion at the end of the weekend was a Tuscon Turf team that didn't lose a game over the course of the event. Bishop Gorman tight end Brevin Jordan (Photo: Barton Simmons, 247Sports) \nAs a team, nobody showed more chemistry all weekend than the eventual champion but chemistry aside, we wanted to put together our 'Dream Team' from the event. Based on performances over the weekend alone, the following is our ideal Pylon 7on7 roster. \nQuarterback \n7on7s are quarterback showcases and it's impossible to limit our dream team to one quarterback given all the strong showings. It's really difficult to limit the team even to four but these are the four that impressed us the most over the course of the weekend. \nTyler Shough (HeadsUp) –There were a couple of games that Shough was borderline perfect in terms of completion percentage and decision making and he was doing it while taking downfield shots. Nebraska and Arizona State are among the major programs toying with joining Western Kentucky, Hawaii, Harvard and Columbia on Shough's offer list. \nKenyon Oblad (All-American Pride) – A local product, Oblad led his team to the championship game, beating some of the tournament's heavy hitters along the way. There was no fear in his game and some of his best throws came in the biggest moments. BYU and San Diego State are among his early offers. \nBrock Purdy (Valor Elite) – There may not have been a team that put up more points over the course of the weekend than Purdy's squad and his precision was the primary driver of that. Though he has no offers to date, Purdy was an absolute surgeon all weekend long. \nJacob Sirmon (FSP 5-star) – In terms of body, frame, arm-strength and the complete physical package, Sirmon was the guy that jumped out at the quarterback position. The Washington commit showed five-star traits and looked to be in total control of his offense. \nWide Receiver \n- Mark Pope (Florida Fire) – He's simply the most effortless receiver at the event. He's got 'go get it' speed that makes him impossible to overthrow, he is great route-runner with phenomenal hands and he shows make-miss ability after the catch. The Miami lean was fantastic all weekend. \n- Marquez Powell (All-American Pride) – En route to the tournament's championship game, Powell was perhaps the best receiver on his squad, showcasing size and downfield speed. Hawaii is the only offer at this point but Powell outplayed a lot of receivers with a lot more than that. He should see that offer list grow in the coming months. \n- Gee Scott Jr. (FSP Elite) – The Eastside Catholic freshman out of Bellevue, Wash. is going to be a name to watch out of the 2020 class. He's deceptively big at 6-2 but he runs routes and plays wide receiver with the fluidity of a much smaller prospect. He helped lead a young team into the tournament's final four by being a big-play threat in the pass-game. \n- Elijah Moore (Florida Fire) – It's hard to believe that Moore had only 9 catches as a high school junior last season at St. Thomas Aquinas in Ft. Lauderdale. Expect that to change next season. Moore is incredibly explosive, is a rare YAC threat in a one-hand touch setting and he was maybe the most exciting player at the event. Miami is considered the favorite. \n- D'Shayne James (Valor Elite) – Behind the quarterback play of Purdy, Valor Elite's team made up of Gilbert (Ariz.) Perry High School prospects lit up the scoreboard and James was the top wide receiver weapon. He showed good size, outstanding hands, and reliability in an event where every catch mattered. James has no offers to date. \nTight end \n– Brevin Jordan (702 Elite) – Jordan has developed from a hybrid flex tight end body into a really difficult wide-bodied mismatch. He's got a really big lower-half, is really strong, has a good feel for when and where to sit down his routes and also can be a downfield threat. Miami, Michigan, UCLA and USC are among his favorites. \nTwo-way athlete \n- Jamarye Joiner (Tuscon Turf) – The Arizona commit led his team to a tournament championship by making a ton of plays on both sides of the football. He was sniffing out route-combinations at safety, showing really good ballskills at wide receiver and showcasing elite athleticism throughout the weekend. \nCornerback \n– Level Price Jr. (Ground Zero) – Though he's small, Price was active throughout the weekend, providing a lock-down type of presence on what was arguably the best defensive unit of the tournament. The St. John Bosco product has yet to land his first offer. \n– Kyler Gordon (FSP 5-star) – In terms of cornerback play, Gordon looked like the most polished, most instinctive guy on the premises. He plays big, plays physical and has really good awareness to go with his really athletic profile. Stanford and Washington are among Gordon's favorites. \n– Darien Chase (Air One Football Academy) – A class of 2019 prospect, Chase was an absolute discovery on the weekend. He could have made the two-way athlete slot on this team and he's probably more of an athlete than a true corner but he showed crazy ball-skills at corner and regularly made quarterbacks pay for testing him. He has no offers yet but I expect him to be a national recruit by this time next year. \nSafety \n– Steve Stephens (DB Guru) – Stephens has a safety mentality with cornerback cover skills. Among any safety at the event, he had the most eye-popping closing speed and when there's a ball in the air, he attacks it. UCLA, Oregon, Cal, Stanford and USC are among the schools currently with his attention. \n– Jaiden Woodbey (Ground Zero) – Physically imposing, athletically elite, Woodbey was perhaps the top prospect at the entire event because of his rare combination of skills. It's really impressive to see a big safety being assigned to every opponent's best wide receiver and locking them down. The Ohio State commit looks rare. \n– Isaiah Tufaga (Hukilau Café) – He looks like he could easily play a hybrid linebacker role based on his size but Tufaga really flashed while playing a two-deep safety spot because of his ability to diagnose plays, break on the football and finish on interceptions. Vanderbilt is currently his biggest offer but more are likely to come for the Hawaiian. \n- Jovan McConico (Rise Football Black) – The Rise Football squad had one of the most stifling defenses of the tournament and McConico was one of the tone-setters for that unit, reeling in numerous interceptions over the course of two days. Treshaun Harrison also deserves mention from that unit as he locked down his side of the field at cornerback. McConico has a BYU offer while Harrison has a host of national offers.
