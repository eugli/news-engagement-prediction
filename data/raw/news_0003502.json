With the Trump administration mounting pressure, Pakistani authorities put Mumbai attack mastermind and Jammat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed and four others under detention under an Anti-Terrorism Act. It has been reported that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif took the step reportedly under immense pressure from the United States. And now, Saeed after his detention released a video blaming PM Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump's growing relationship for his detention. #BREAKING : Terrorist Hafiz Saeed releases video after he was put in house arrest, claims Modi-Trump friendship led to action against him. pic.twitter.com/V5qYI4FTWC - Aditya Raj Kaul (@AdityaRajKaul) January 30, 2017 Meanwhile, Pakistan's army said on Tuesday the detention of Mumbai attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed was a \"policy decision in the national interest\" as the government announced that the Jamat-ud Dawa leader's 90-day house arrest could be extended if required. \"The detention is a policy decision taken in the national interest. The relevant department may give more information in a day or two and the situation will become clearer,\" military spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor said. Saeed and four other JuD leaders were put under house arrest after order of detention was issued by Punjab Province's interior ministry on Monday in pursuance to a directive from the Federal Interior Ministry on January 27. His aides - Abdullah Ubaid, Zafar Iqbal, Abdur Rehman Abid and Qazi Kashif Niaz - were detained and placed under house arrest in Chauburji near JuD's Lahore headquarters. \"Although they belong to different districts of Punjab but the government has decided to place them under arrest in one house in Lahore,\" a senior police officer told PTI. \"The government may take some further steps against the JuD and its sister organisations in coming days,\" he said, adding that the names of several JuD and FIF activists have been placed on Exit Control List to stop them from leaving the country. Maj Gen Ghafoor said Pakistan wants peace with India and resolution of all issues including Kashmir through talks held on the basis of self-respect and honour, but it should not be considered as weakness. \"We want the Kashmir issue to be resolve via United Nations resolutions and dialogue, but this desire for peace should not be misconstrued as a weakness,\" he said. \"My detention order has come from Washington and not Islamabad. If someone thinks that after placing me under house arrest will help check freedom movement in Kashmir he is living a fool's paradise. My arrest will give a fresh impetus to the Kashmiris' struggle against India,\" Saeed, the founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba who carries a USD 10 million bounty on his head, told reporters. Saeed further said if Prime Minister Narendra Modi thinks that he would get respite in Kashmir after his (Saeed) arrest he is seriously mistaken. \"We have declared 2017 a year of solidarity for Kashmiris. All programmes we planned for Feb 5 will be held across Pakistan and (Pakistan-occupied) Kashmir,\" he said, and vowed to challenge his detention in the Lahore High Court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:05:47.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
