To people who haven’t been following this film, that particular song may be a bit surprising, but we’re pretty far removed from the days of Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine hanging out with the X-Men and feuding with Cyclops over Jean Grey’s heart. These days, it’s all sorrow, Professor Xavier dying, and stabbing people alongside a little girl who has the same powers as Jackman’s Logan. There’s not a ton of new stuff here, but we do get to see some glimpses of Logan ’s new robot-handed villain and Xavier having what looks like a telepathic freakout, neither of which bode well for our hirsute hero. \nLogan will be in theaters on March 3.
