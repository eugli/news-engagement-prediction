She is married to lawyer Graham Alloway, president of Alloway and Associates Professional Corporation, and is marketing director for his firm. Slice says she has “born again Christian values.”\n Roxy Earle, “outspoken jet-setter and entrepreneur”: The self-described “style entrepreneur” shares “all my favourite things in life: travel, fashion, puppies, beauty and the art of living fabulously” on her website luxuriousroxy.com , where she says she aspired to “travel to exotic and glamorous places” ever since she was a little girl. She’s the second wife of tech investor Raghu, and was a marketing and advertising executive before she married.\nGregoriane (Grego) Minot, “proud mother and life of the party”: The Montreal-raised actress and dancer is married to Pierre Jutras, who runs the Spoke Club and Spoke on the Water. She put her career on hold for her family but is a well-established French Canadian actress, according to Slice. Her IMDb resume includes the films La Run (2011) and Recon 2023 (2009).\nAnn Kaplan Mulholland, “sharp businesswoman with an even sharper wit”: Born in Winnipeg, she is the CEO of iFinance Canada, parent company to Medicard, Petcard and Dentalcard, which finance medical, dental and veterinary procedures.
