(Photo: Susan Walsh/AP)\nThe FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes , @NBCNews , @ABC , @CBS , @CNN ) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 No, American People, we are not your enemy.\nWe in the media are, in spite of what President Donald Trump tells you on Twitter, your friend.\nGranted, sometimes we are the friend who, when you ask if you look fat in those pants, tells you that yes, you do . And we might look into where you got the money to buy them.\nOn the other hand, if you look good in them , we’ll tell you that, too.\nIt’s not surprising that Trump doesn’t like this kind of friend. It takes a strong person to acknowledge weakness. Some people, when confronted with uncomfortable truths, lash out at those who deliver them, then spread rumors and falsehoods about them to take the heat off.\nAt least that’s how it works in junior high.\nRELATED: Can Trump hold a press conference every day? Please? | Trump takes over primetime TV with real news: Announcing his Supreme Court pick | Trump the TV critic: 'SNL' skit a 'hit job' | Covering Trump's lies no simple task | Criticize Trump, get a mean tweet?\nIs that really where we are? It seems like it sometimes, with the whole “I know you are but what am I” mentality going around. Better to take the high road, though it’s not getting much use lately.\nThat’s OK. Trump can continue to malign the media, call unflattering stories “fake” and try to weaken influence and trust. And we’ll just keep telling the truth, even if it does mean the Big Man on Campus won't ever invite us to the dance. Popularity isn’t the most-important thing. Truth is.\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com. Facebook: facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.
