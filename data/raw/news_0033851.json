Gary makes his phone screen appear as though it has cracked (Photo: Gary Simon) \nPleased with his idea, Gary then handed his phone over to his daughter so she could play her game. \nBut moments later, it all started to go very wrong. \nAs the phone was 'corrupted', the frightened girl immediately handed back to her father and ran away, yelling: \"I'm scared.\" Read More \nUnable to hold back laughter, Gary then told his daughter she'd been 'trolled', prompting her to immediately burst into tears and call for her mum. \nHilariously, the footage then cuts Gary and his little girl heading into a toy store. \nWith a huge smile on her face, the little girl starts picking out her latest toy. The plan backfired when his daughter burst into tears (Photo: Gary Simon) Read More Fed-up girlfriend soaks toilet roll in pepper spray to get revenge \nHer father asks: \"You going to hate me still?\", to which she happily replies: \"No.\" \nAfterwards, Gary posted the method for his 'evil' app online, writing: \"It may seem a bit cruel, especially based on her reaction in the above video (yikes, I was not expecting that). But I decided to bribe back her affection with a trip to Toys 'R' Us.\" \nYou can check out Gary's app in further detail on his website Coursetro.com .
