It is a statement made by certain members of the weeaboo subculture which denotes that fictional women from anime and manga , who are 2-dimensional, are superior to normal women and reality, or 3D. The term is still most frequently used in the ironic sense. Origin \nAccording to Lurkmore [4] and Encyclopedia Dramatica , [5] the “Pig Disgusting” insult first started on 4chan’s /b/ (Random) board in 2007 from a copypasta featuring a Korean ranting about American culture, which is referred to as “ PIG DISGUSTING ” (shown below). Although it is unknown when 3D was added to the insult, it is speculated this first happened on 4chan’s /a/ (Anime & Manga) board due to the focus of the board. \nI’M KOREAN SON OF A BITCH AMERICAN AMERICAN IS PIG DO YOU WANT A HAMBURGER ? DO YOU WANT A PIZZA ? AMERICAN IS PIG DISGUSTING GEORGE WALKER BUSH IS A MURDERER FUCKING U.S.A Spread \nThe idea of men claiming the superiority of fictional women over real women first became more notable to the mainstream web in 2009, when a Japanese man – who went by his online handle SAL9000 – married Nene Anegasaki, a fictional character from the Nintendo DS game Love Plus. The wedding was subsequently livestreamed on Nico Nico Douga , resulting in widespread attention and coverage of the event in the West as well. [1] [2] [3] Noose Portal \nIn its ironic usage, 3DPD is commonly combined with promoting suicide as a method to be able to meet anime women and one’s waifu in the afterlife; which in turn is frequently combined with a popular exploitable image, known as a “noose portal” of a hangman’s noose with anime women in the center and the message “they’re waiting.” Make Anime Real \nMake Anime Real is an expression used in tongue-in-cheek endorsements of political candidates, indicating they will magically bring anime characters into reality when elected into office.
