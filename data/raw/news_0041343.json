Picture: The Sun. Tom Gillespie The Sun Share on Twitter \nA FREELANCE television worker claims she was dropped by her employer because she was “too good looking”. \nEmma Hulse has said she was just five minutes into an eight-hour shift when her manager said: “Are you not doing catwalks? Why are you not at the front of house?” reports The Sun . Emma Hulse is pursuing a career in television. Picture: The Sun. Source: The Sun \nShe then claims the manager, who has not been named, sent her home after he “suggested we go for a drink”, the Evening Standard reports . \nThe firm Unit TV have admitted how the situation played out and have confirmed the relevant manager no longer works for them. \nEmma describes herself as a runner, production assistant, and camera operating executive on her TalentManager profile. \nThe 24-year-old from Mayfair in London said: “We were supposed to finish at 6pm and I got there for 9.30am and when I got there this other runner started explaining to me what I should do. Emma describes herself as a runner, production assistant, and camera operating executive on her TalentManager profile. Picture: The Sun Source: The Sun \n“Then they send me on a run. Then my agent text me that I’m no longer required. \n“I got there and spoke to the line manager and he asked me, ‘Are you a model? Are you not doing catwalks, why are you not at the front of house?’ \n“I was wearing a lipstick but from my perspective I was not inappropriate. I was wearing a shirt and trousers. I really didn’t think I looked inappropriate. \n“Then he took my number, he suggested we go for a drink.” Sarah’s agent sent her a text message to tell her that the employer no longer wanted her. Picture: The Sun Source: The Sun \nShe added: “I was quite disappointed to be sent home. I didn’t really know what to do. \n“Maybe that company employs plain looking people and maybe if you don’t look that way they don’t take you, maybe I was a distraction. \n“I do camera operating as well, I work for many different companies and no one has sent me home because of the way I look. Especially within a creative agency you should be free to wear what you want.” \nAdam Luckwell, owner of the company, said: “We found there were a number of things we were not happy with. \n“We decided not to continue with the employment and terminated the contract within three months. \n“We felt he was a bad fit for us and some of the things he was doing was not in line with the company’s policy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:54:19.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
