He is currently one of only three actors who have been with “Hamilton” since the very beginning — the other two are Javier Munoz, who currently plays Hamilton, and Thayne Jasperson, an ensemble member — but he’ll take his last bow as Lafayette/Jefferson in mid-April, departing the show after more than two years of eight performances a week.\n“I will always look back at this mountain and this was an Everest,” Stewart says.\nThe actor, 33, reflected on his experience with “Hamilton,” his relationship to money, and what public speakers can take from the actor’s playbook:\nMarketWatch: What are you a cheapskate about? What do you splurge on?\nSeth Stewart: I’m a cheapskate on my rent because I’m an actor. I splurge on food and vacations. I am living further out in Queens [New York] so that if I don’t have a job for a year, I’m not stressed about my rent. Every actor’s had a dry season because of what we do. Our work is never guaranteed. I’m saving my money. But I make sure I go out and eat all the time. I love really expensive meals. I feel like that’s what life’s about: Good food and good conversation.\nMarketWatch: What’s the biggest money mistake you’ve ever made?\nStewart: I don’t believe in money mistakes. I had a 3,000-square-foot film studio in Hoboken [New Jersey] for four years. By the end of my fourth year, I was almost breaking even, then we got flooded by [Hurricane] Sandy. But I learned so much from that. I invested in another e-commerce startup in 2014 and spent, on an actor’s salary, a fair amount. We never even officially opened the company but in those 10 months, I learned so much. You can always make the money back. I feel like I took my money chances in businesses but I learned from them.\nMarketWatch: What’s something that people don’t realize about “Hamilton” ?\nStewart: People ask how we feel, say this must be the most exciting thing. They’re looking from the outside in. I say this has been my Everest, because it’s one of the hardest shows I’ve ever done. People are seeing the flash. People are seeing us when the lights are on. People are not seeing when we’re going to physical therapy, vocal therapy, taking Epson salt baths — all the things to maintain this.\nI think people don’t realize that the hardest work is done outside of the show, to be able to make sure that when we do the show, it is as unbelievable as you expected. Again, the demand for greatness is always much more than what people see. It’s like the iceberg, people only see what’s above sea level, but the work we have to do and the iceberg underneath it to keep it going — everything from the company management, rehearsals, dance captains, stage management — is crazy. The real work is always unseen. What people are seeing is all they’re supposed to see.\nIn life and business, whether you’re working toward a great relationship, writing a musical, working on a presentation, you always have to know that 90% of your work is unseen. It won’t be applauded, nobody will care. You gotta suck it up so you can live that 10%.\nDon’t miss: Is it better to buy stuff or experiences? Lin-Manuel Miranda and my Vitamix blender have the answer\nMarketWatch: Your “Hamilton” stage entrance is explosive as Lafayette, and amusingly grand as Jefferson. Sometimes leaders need to speak to a crowd, but the crowd isn’t energized. How do you draw out the audience?\nStewart: You don’t play to a crowd. You play to your material — whether that be the scripts or the character that I’m playing. For public speakers, if you’re getting up to speak, you’re bringing new information or telling information in a different way that can stand alone. You just worry about whether your material is so strong that eventually they’re going to find their way in. It’s like music — when they hear a song for the first time, they may not like it, but a couple minutes in they might feel it. Otherwise you’re going to be fishing for energy or responses that may never get there.\nMarketWatch: You deliver one of the show’s most memorable lines — “Immigrants: we get the job done” — eight times a week. How do you make sure it never flops?\nStewart: I have to calm myself down sometimes because some people may not want to hear it. How I deliver it? I just deliver it very matter of fact. When something’s a good line, you don’t need to put anything extra on it. The thing about art or presenting any sort of material is, we’re not doing it for the reaction. We’re doing it because it’s something that needs to be shared.\nMarketWatch: You’ve been in the show since the very beginning. There have been reincarnations of the company, but you were in the original cast.\nStewart: I always compare it to the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls. There will never be anything else like the original cast. The choices the new actors are making are fantastic and some of the choices they’re making I like better. But it will never be the same again and that’s why it was so special. There’s just a nostalgia about it, it’s like an era.\n(This interview was edited for style and space.)\nMore from MarketWatch Disney Cuts Ties to YouTube Superstar PewDiePie China’s economy is dangerously close to unraveling Tips for Hearing TVs Better", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:42:13.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
