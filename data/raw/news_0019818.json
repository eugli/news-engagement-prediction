Teachers' Federation, superintendent of the old Unit 3 School Board, and director of curriculum for the province. In the 1970s, he supported the merger of a number of old one- and two-room elementary schools, a move he now regrets.\nLarger schools appropriate for older students\nNot all of the mergers were misguided, said Stratton. Larger junior and senior high schools make sense, he said, because larger schools can offer programs such as industrial arts that smaller schools can't.\n\"However, we also built these large, factory elementary schools, and I thought it was a wonderful idea, the consolidation of elementary schools,\" he said.\nSterling Stratton would like to see smaller elementary schools in urban areas as well. (Matt Rainnie/CBC)\n\"As I look back, we really should have taken a long look at that one-room school, the two-room school, and said is there anything in there that we should have retained?\"\nElementary schools are different kinds of institutions, he said.\n\"Half of the teaching that goes on in elementary school has to do with socialization, it has to do with getting along with people. It has to do with developing your personality,\" said Stratton.\n\"It's an accountant's view, financially, that some of these [schools] should close. That's not what we should be looking for. What's the quality of education like in each of those schools?\"\nStratton believes the communities created by these smaller schools, where students, teachers and parents all know one another, create great benefits for young children. Rather than closing smaller schools in rural areas, he would like to see smaller schools created in urban areas.\nMORE P.E.I. NEWS | More snow coming after overnight storm MORE P.E.I.
