Ludwig-USA TODAY Sports)\nStory Highlights Rex Ryan wasted no time erasing the Bills logo off his truck, doing it the day after he was fired. Ryan has landed a television gig with ESPN and will be part of its Super Bowl coverage Sunday. Ryan was fired after going 15-16 with the Bills. He is now 65-68 all-time as an NFL head coach. Well, it took a few weeks for the bombast to return, but Rex Ryan — newly minted television analyst — let his true feelings be heard Monday night regarding his firing by the Buffalo Bills.\nIn a story written by Manish Mehta of the New York Daily News , Ryan said he wasn’t bitter about losing his job, but then spent most of the rest of the interview sounding bitter.\nIt was classic motor-mouth Rex, and in many ways, served as the perfect bookend to his two-year tenure in Buffalo. He came in spewing all kinds of rhetoric that day he was introduced as the Bills’ new head coach, and now he has exited doing the same thing, albeit with a far different tone.\nThe highlight of the Daily News story was when Ryan talked about altering the look of his truck, replacing the Bills-themed tapestry with a simple Clemson University logo, a nod to the college football national champions for whom his son, Seth, plays for.\nThe final moment of Rex Ryan's tenure in Buffalo was shaking hands with Miami coach Adam Gase after the Bills lost to the Dolphins on Dec. 24. (Photo: File photo)\n“Let me tell you, I stripped that damn truck the day I got fired,” Ryan said. “(Expletive) you guys. Dude, national champions. I’m supporting a winner.”\nTake that, Terry and Kim Pegula, and by extension the Bills’ organization and their fan base, too.\nRyan was fired by the Pegulas on Dec. 27, just three days after the Bills had been officially eliminated from the playoff race thanks to an egregious 34-31 overtime loss to the Miami Dolphins. He left town with a record of 15-16, which — believe it or not — is the best winning percentage of any Bills coach since Wade Phillips went 29-19 from 1998 to 2000.\nIt wasn’t a great record by any stretch, and the Bills failed to make the playoffs in both years, but it’s clear that Ryan didn’t think he deserved to be fired.\n“I set the expectations too high,” Ryan said. “Like, boy, that’s a shock. In a way, I felt, why not us? I stepped in where the head coach (Doug Marrone) had quit, the defensive coordinator (Jim Schwartz) quit, and the quarterback (Kyle Orton) quit on them. So, I thought that it was important at the time to say, ‘You know what? Shoot, I believe in you. And I’m proud to be the coach here.’ Every bit of that was true. I put that truck (with the Bills logo) around town. I was all-in. Even though those other three had quit, I wasn’t a quitter. I was ready. And I wanted to be there. And I wanted to win. And I thought I could win.”\n► Sean McDermott sweeping out Rex Ryan's coaching staff ► Rex Ryan will make his debut for ESPN Sunday ► Sal Maiorana's story on the firing of Rex Ryan. Of course, the biggest reason why the Bills didn’t win was that Ryan’s defense – the one he proclaimed on day one of his employment in Buffalo would be the best in the NFL – failed. Yes, the often erratic play of quarterback Tyrod Taylor was certainly a factor in straddling the .500 mark, and injuries sabotaged the Bills as well, but had Ryan’s defense played the way he told us it would, the Bills may have made the playoffs both years. You just won’t ever get him to admit that.\n“I wasn’t real lucky coming in there with the situation I did,” Ryan said. “Hey, that’s the way it goes. No excuses. We went in there and did the best we could. I wish things would have been different. I wish Sammy Watkins wouldn’t have had a broken foot and been healthy the whole year. I wish our draft picks would have played. There’s a lot of things that I wished for, but at the end of the day, I’m responsible for the product on the field.”\nRyan will pocket $16.5 million from the Bills — the remainder of what he’s owed from his five-year contract — for doing absolutely nothing, money he can tack on to whatever ESPN is going to pay him to be an analyst. He will work Super Bowl Sunday, and then will likely be gradually phased into the network’s football coverage.\nRex Ryan brought in his brother, Rob, to help coach the defense, a move that likely played a role in his firing. (Photo: Kirby Lee, Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports)\n“I’m really not that bitter and maybe that ($16.5) million is one of the reasons,” Ryan said. “I’m not bitter, man. Yeah, I’m hurt. I was hurt by it. There’s no question. But bitter ain’t how I feel. I’m like, ‘Shoot, if they never wanted me here, then fine. I ain’t here. I’m not your coach anymore. Fine and dandy.’ But I got an opportunity in front of me that a lot of guys don’t get. I’m going to see where it takes me. Maybe this a different career and I really enjoy it. I’m hoping that’s the way it is. Maybe I get into and I don’t like it. Maybe they don’t like me. Maybe I go back to doing something I love, which is coaching. I’ll never say never. I’m a young guy still. ... I’m healthy. But bitter? Nah. Not bitter, man. I’m really not.”\nIt doesn’t seem like he’s looking to get back into coaching, at least not right now, and he made it clear that if he did return to a sideline, it will be as a head coach, not as an assistant or coordinator.\n“I’ve been real fortunate,” Ryan said. “I got two opportunities when a lot of great coaches don’t get any. How many were realistic opportunities? I’m not sure, but at least I had a chance to step up to the plate. So, that’s something I’ll always be grateful for. The one thing about (being on TV) is that you don’t lose. You’ll remember every damn loss (as a coach). But the wins? You don’t necessarily remember. So, it takes a lot out of you. I’m tired of getting (expletive). Unless it’s a real situation, there’s no sense of getting into it again.”\nAs for the Bills, if Ryan truly isn’t bitter, he has a funny way of expressing that.\n“I don’t wish them bad will,” Ryan said. “I don’t. But I don’t wish them luck, either. I’ll be honest: I don’t wish them good luck. I don’t wish them bad luck. I just don’t wish them luck. I wish the Jets luck.”\nMAIORANA@Gannett.com", "external_links": ["http://bcdownload.gannett.edgesuite.net/rochester/36517057001/201611/1381/36517057001_5214602458001_5214587347001-th.jpg",
