Now there’s Adrian Solano, a Venezuelan skier whose only training for tackling the Nordic world ski championships in Finland was using wheels beneath the bright sun. \nHaving never trained on snow, Solano wobbled nervously backward as he exited the starting gate at the FIS cross-country championships this week. He fumbled into the white powder after sliding down a small hill. And he tried awkwardly walking up an incline while others raced past him. Oleg S. (@AnnaK_4ever) Adrian Solano from Venezuela at the FIS World Championships in Finland. It was his first time on skis and on snow. #Lahti2017 pic.twitter.com/KR7LTr03y1 \nSports commentators watching aghast at his near-comedic cross-country performance have dubbed him the worst skier alive. \nBut Solano teetered along, unfazed. \n“From here to the Olympics!” he proclaimed in an interview with Norwegian tabloid Dagbladet. Eddie ‘the Eagle’ Edwards: ‘My parents didn't quite understand what had happened with the Olympics’ Read more \nSolano’s saga has hit a nerve among Venezuelans and caused a minor diplomatic spat after France deported the athlete in January while he was trying to get to Sweden to train on snow. Airport migration officials in Paris allegedly doubted his story, thinking his journey to the slopes was a ploy to leave his beleaguered country. \n“We will issue a strong statement to the French government for their affront against a Venezuelan athlete,” Venezuela’s foreign minister, Delcy Rodriguez, wrote in a tweet on Wednesday. \nStuck back in Caracas, Solano’s supporters started a GoFundMe page that brought him to Finland just in time to compete.

He completed the first 3.5km in 37 minutes and 39 seconds – the same amount of time it took other competitors to finish the entire course. In the 1.6km cross-country sprint he finished last in 156th place. \n“Embarrassing!” wrote one critic on his Instagram page, who went on to accuse him of receiving sponsorship from the Venezuelan government while countless go hungry. Solano has vowed to keep competing. Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters \n“My friend,” he wrote in response, “I swear I am not here because of the government. I arrived thanks to people who heard my story and supported me.” \nStill, many others are rallying to support Solano and his dream of one day waving the Venezuelan flag in the winter Olympics. \n“I achieved a dream,” he said in his interview with the Norwegian newspaper. “This pushes me to try more every day.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:12:14.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
