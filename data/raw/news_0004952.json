Schaben / Los Angeles Times) \nHere's our growing guide to essential California adventures, easy to edgy. We'll be adding to it daily all year.

Email and put California Bucket List in the subject line. Southern California Feb. 2, 2017, 6:00 a.m. Take a lap around Pasadena's historic Rose Bowl Chris Erskine (Pasadena Convention & Visitors Bureau) \nWhy: You’ve seen it from the blimp. Now see it up close, with a three-mile stroll around this lovely landmark and the lush public golf course next door. In a rush? You can drive it as well. \nWhat : Sports Illustrated once dubbed the Rose Bowl the No. 1 venue in college sports, and the 94-year-old stadium has hosted several Super Bowls as well. But whether you’re a sports fan or not, you’ll appreciate this setting. \nGo in the late afternoon, when the setting sun gives the San Gabriels a rosy glow, then stop for dinner or a drink on the patio of Brookside Restaurant (park for free in the course lot, or in nearby stadium lot D). Locals use this route around the stadium as their free health club, for biking and hiking. Stadium tours take place the last Friday of the month. \nWhere: 1001 Rose Bowl Drive, Pasadena, 12 miles east of downtown L.A. \nHow much: Walks are free; stadium tours cost $17.50. \nInfo : For tour reservations, contact the Rose Bowl . Southern California Feb. 1, 2017, 6:00 a.m. Follow 'Star Trek' to Vasquez Rocks in Agua Dulce (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) \nWhy: Because your mission is to boldly go where William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy have gone before. \nWhat: The jagged and otherworldly forms of Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park , a 932-acre geological oddity in northeastern L.A. County, have been attracting film crews for nearly a century, including the markers of the vintage TV series \"The Lone Ranger\" (1949-1957). But no film or TV property can match the \"Star Trek\" franchise's faithfulness. \nIn a beloved episode called \"Arena,\" Captain Kirk battled an overgrown lizard called a Gorn amid these red rocks. In the \"Friday's Child\" episode, these rocks represented the planet Capella IV. In the \"Shore Leave\" episode, the rocks stand in for planet Omicron Delta, where Kirk is again called upon to do battle. The list goes on. \nIn fact, the entertainment reference site IMDB lists more than 350 productions that have shot at the rocks, including the films \"Austin Powers,\" \"Blazing Saddles,\" \"Frankenstein\" (the 1931 Boris Karloff version) and \"Dracula\" (the 1931 Bela Lugosi version) and the TV shows \"Maverick,\" \"Kung Fu\" and \"The Big Bang Theory.\" \nAll this action follows an equally lively pre-Hollywood history: In the 1870s, a notorious bandit named Tiburcio Vásquez used to hide out here to avoid the law. \nWhere: 10700 W. Escondido Canyon Road, Agua Dulce, Los Angeles County, 43 miles north of downtown L.A. \nHow much: Free.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T16:13:07.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
