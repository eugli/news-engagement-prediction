The offer came right after the birth of Thurman’s first child and before she starred in Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill.” \n“ I would have played Eowyn in ‘Lord of the Rings,'” Colbert, a hardcore J. R. R. Tolkien fan, derided. \nThe Peter Jackson-helmed trilogy went on to make almost $3 billion. “Lord of the Rings” also won 17 Oscars out of thirty nominations. \nThe duo also discussed Thurman’s father, the first American Tibetan Buddhist monk, her children, being a Tarantino muse and the work that went into her iconic roles. Finally, Thurman shared details about her character named Lenny Cohen, a mysterious villain’s enforcer she plays on the new Bravo! show “Imposters.” \nWatch the clip below; the “Lord of the Rings” talk begins shortly after the one minute mark: Filed Under:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:20:18.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
