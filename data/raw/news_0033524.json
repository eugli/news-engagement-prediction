(AP)  12 AM \nThe ban is over. \nAfter James Dolan announced Friday that Charles Oakley was indefinitely barred from entering the Garden, the Knicks owner has had a change of heart, according to The Undefeated . \nDolan and Oakley met face-to-face with NBA commissioner Adam Silver at the league office Monday, with Michael Jordan joining the conversation via conference call to try to resolve their differences. \nSilver released a statement Monday night, saying Dolan was hopeful that Oakley would join him at MSG “as his guest in the near future,\" but Oakley told the Daily News that an immediate resolution would be difficult only because “some of the things that were said about me hurt.” \nThe former Knick was hauled out of the Garden during Wednesday’s game against the Clippers and subsequently arrested. The Knicks had claimed Oakley was being unruly, while Oakley claimed Dolan asked for his removal. Charles Oakley is removed from the Garden by security and then arrested on Wednesday. (Frank Franklin II/AP) \nTensions mounted even more when Dolan went on “The Michael Kay Show” Friday, saying the Knicks legend has an anger problem and alluded to a drinking one as well. \nDolan had said Oakley would be welcomed back to MSG if he would admit to his “problem.” \nThis is a breaking news story, check back for more details...
