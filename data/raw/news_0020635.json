For the past 21 years I've always spent valentine's day alone and honestly I always get jealous when I see all the couples in their lovey-dovey states. There is not a single girl who has shown interest in me or made any attempt to ask me out. I would say my circle of friends is pretty big but I guess for those girls that I'm closer to, we're so deep in the friendzone that it's impossible to get out. \nSo anyway I would like to ask if any girl out there is willing to go out with me on valentine's day? Of course it doesn't have to be a date, it can just be a simple dinner but at least there's an opportunity to get to know each other better. I'm honestly really sick of spending the last 21 valentine's day alone at home studying so this year I'd really like to change that. Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
