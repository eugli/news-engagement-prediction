They even give advice on the parts to eat and how to prepare the flesh. \n“These views on cannibalism are not mainstream but they are gaining traction. \n“It’s new to see them advocate cannibalism. They are using Salafism – a fundamentalist theology and political Islamism - to justify their views.” \nThe news comes after Isis militants fed a desperate mum the mutilated remains of her kidnapped son after telling her it was cooked meat and rice. \nThe worried mum had bravely visited the terror group’s headquarters in a bid to speak to her son, who had been captured and taken prisoner by militants in Mosul, Iraq.

She was horrified when she found out the meal they had given her was bits of her son. \nThe Quilliam Foundation was set up by two former members of the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir who renounced terrorism and now aim to challenge extremism and promote democracy. \nRafiq said Quilliam is keen to come to Scotland to root out jihadism in schools, colleges, universities and jails.

But with Islamic State, the average age is 14 to 25 and 10 per cent of recruits are young girls and women.” \nThe revelations about ISIS cannibalism come after a number of real-life Hannibal Lecters have come to light. \nIn Russia, two men confessed to stabbing a victim and then beating him with a hammer. \nThey then cut up his body and ate part of it, before selling some of it to a kiosk that sold doner kebabs and pies. \nNotorious Joseph Kony, chief of the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda, has been responsible for a long list of horrific crimes including cannibalism.
