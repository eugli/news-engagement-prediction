RECIPE: Spinach Garganelli with Lamb Bolognese \nDuring the filming of that episode of Chef’s Night Out , Gabe Thompson, co-owner and chef at L’Apicio, gave us a crash course on how to properly whip up this comforting dish, or any pasta for that matter. \n“Pasta and sauce are supposed to be like salad dressing basically, so you want enough to coat the noodle,” Thompson told us, before shovelling on heaps of sheep’s cheese—the ideal pairing for a lamb-based sauce. “I like to finish it with pecorino.” \nPecorino is Parmigiano Reggiano’s funkier, more affordable little brother, so don’t hold on back when it comes time to garnish; the flavorful sauce and noodles can handle it. \nThe bolognese is a cinch to make and a single batch will get you through the longest and dreariest of winter work weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T23:06:41.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
