It resulted in a meeting between the president and the publication’s editorial board shortly after the election that has not resulted in any lasting peace between the two sides.\n \n“I think that there is fault on both sides here,” said Morgan, on the situation. “I think that it is dangerous and toxic.”\n\nCarlson asked Morgan about his own experiences working for CNN and whether there was a “special connection between CNN” and the Democratic party.\n“To be honest, and to be fair to CNN, I think the vast majority of people who work there, particularly the anchors, have great integrity,” Morgan answered. “I don’t think they would want to be party to any of this kind of stuff.”\n \nTrending Stories Pelosi: Trump’s Actions ‘Not Grounds For Impeachment’ W.Va.
