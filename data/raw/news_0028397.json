It will also protect a far wider range of sectors, rather than just government and national security-related industries, like defence. \nGCHQ will still be the parent body for the NCSC, meaning it can draw on the intelligence agency's skills and capabilities. \nSometimes, the intelligence arm of GCHQ spots compromised networks as it watches adversaries move across the internet. Image copyright PA Image caption GCHQ can detect the work of hackers around the globe \nIt was through this type of work that GCHQ spotted the compromise of the US Democratic Party's information by Russian hackers, which it then informed US authorities about. \nThe NCSC is working on trial services to pro-actively discover vulnerabilities in public sector websites, help government departments better manage spoofing of their email, and take down tens of thousands of phishing sites affecting the UK. \n\"We're actively working to reduce the harm caused by cyber-attacks against the UK and will use the government as a guinea pig for all the measures we want to see done by industry at national scale,\" says the NCSC technical director, Dr Ian Levy. \nHe says results would be published openly to enhance collaboration. The centre will be publishing some of its code as open source, so that others can use the techniques. \nA five-year National Cyber Security Strategy was announced in November 2016, with £1.9bn of investment. \nThe chancellor is also due to announce the creation of a \"Industry 100\" scheme, which will grant 100 NCSC secondments to private sector staff.
