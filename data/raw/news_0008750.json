Athena Picture Agency 4 Two years ago Norbury was cleared of historic sexual abuse concerning two girls \nHe said: “If she was under 18, yes. But she was over the age of 18 … I don’t know what her motivations are for saying this, but she was a consenting adult at the time.” \nHe added: “She was a willing participant. There was no force.” \nNorbury faces six allegations relating to three teenage girls and admitted that a relationship with another girl – Girl B – was “inappropriate” due to their nine-year age gap. Athena Picture Agency 4 He was sacked from a primary school in Swansea following an investigation \nHowever, he denied sending her inappropriate texts as well as kissing and sexually touching her when she was 15. \nHe said he had received texts from the girl as a teenager but that she had turned 18 before they had a “fling”. \nNorbury said: “We would meet up, but she was a consenting adult. She was 18. Never younger than that.” \nNorbury also admitted to having sex with a virgin teenage girl – Girl A – on his parents’ lounge floor but denies it happening before she turned 16. \nGirl A told the hearing that Norbury “knew [her] background and he was taking advantage of it” and that “as soon as I turned 16 he took everything because he could”. \nWe pay for your stories!
