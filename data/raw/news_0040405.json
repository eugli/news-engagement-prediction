The Book Traces project uncovers 19th-century expressions of love in the margins of library books, offering a glimpse into a past culture and its social understanding of the written word. February 13, 2017 Katie McNally , \nAlthough they’re always quiet, the stacks of the University of Virginia’s Alderman Library echo with the whispers of love and lives gone by. They emanate from the pages of thousands of books, where long-dead readers scribbled tiny remembrances and musings in the margins. \nA UVA-led project, Book Traces , is cataloging these and other small windows into the past with the goal of creating a massive distributed archive on the history of reading. The project began in Alderman, but has spread to stacks all across the world as a crowd-sourced project to scan and catalog unique marginalia. \nIt works specifically with pre-copyright books published before 1923, so most of the collection is from the 19 th century and includes the writings of book owners during that time period. \nItems found inside Alderman’s 19 th -century collections vary from lovesick poetry written by the owners, to simple musings on everyday life, to tiny drawing and even cutouts preserved between the pages. UVA English professor Andrew Stauffer, who heads the Book Traces project, said that while it’s rare to find extremely personal notes in the margins, there are some cases where the margins became a diary-like space for their past owners. \n“Overall, about 12 percent of Alderman Library books have some kind of writing in them by their original owners. But only a small percentage of those contain emotionally revealing, personal notations,” he said. “Books are semi-private spaces in which to write: they may be picked up, read, loaned or inherited by others, and so people tend toward reticence. But it is clear that readers in previous centuries sometimes reacted to their books by inscribing parts of their lives, including their romantic feelings, within them.” \nIn light of Valentine’s Day, Stauffer shared examples of some of the love-struck scribblers he and his team have uncovered. \n“My favorite has to be the copy of Longfellow’s poetry owned by Jane Chapman Slaughter,” he said. “She uses the book to record her memories of reading aloud with her beloved in the summer of 1900, marking passages with comments like ‘You read this and I said, ‘It just suits your voice,’’ and ‘You read this to me the day you said goodbye.’” \nSlaughter was one of the first women to earn her Ph.D. from the University, graduating with a doctorate in Romance languages in 1935 at age 75. Her collected papers and books were later left to the University. The notes in her copy of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s “Poems and Ballads” offer a vision into her early life and the longing she felt for a lost love from those days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T22:48:09.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
