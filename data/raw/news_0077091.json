Albert Breer of The MMQB first reported the Chargers' decision to keep Ingram under the one-year tender. Ingram appeared destined to be tagged with the injury-risk label early in his career. After appearing in all 16 games as a rookie with the Chargers, the 2012 first-round pick played in 13 games between 2013-14 due to injuries. There was a dramatic shift in Ingram's career starting in 2015 that carried through last season. The 27-year-old has recorded 18.5 sacks and started all 32 games over the past two seasons, erasing any doubts about his long-term health. Bryson Vesnaver of Pro Football Focus ranked Ingram No. 5 on a list of players who could hit unrestricted free agency back in November, highlighting his all-around ability as a huge asset working in his favor. \"Among 3-4 outside linebackers, Ingram has a pass-rushing productivity score of 10.7, and his 39 total pressures ranks fifth,\" Vesnaver wrote. \"But he also adds the ability to defend the run well, and can drop into coverage if need be. His 76.0 coverage grade ranks third among edge defenders (one of the players above him is Jamie Collins, who played inside linebacker most of the season).\" The Chargers underwent a change at head coach during the offseason, hiring Anthony Lynn to replace Mike McCoy after missing the playoffs for three straight years and posting consecutive losing seasons. Losing a key piece of the defense was not going to be a good way for Lynn to start his tenure with the team, especially since Ingram and Joey Bosa made quite the formidable duo with 18.5 combined sacks last season. If the Chargers can stay healthy next season, which was rarely the case in 2016, they have the potential to be a sleeper team in the playoff mix. Ingram's presence will help the defense rebound from its poor showing last year when they allowed the fourth-most points in the NFL .
