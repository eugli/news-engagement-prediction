The second was rolled out Friday as justification for abandoning the first. \nProportional representation, the Prime Minister said, would be bad for Canada because it could “augment extremist voices and activist voices that don’t get to sit within a party.” \n“The strength of our democracy is that we have to pull people into big parties that have all the diversity of Canada and we learn to get along,” he said. Mingling with a crowd in Nunavut, he asked a woman: “Do you think that Kellie Leitch should have her own party?” \nWhether Leitch, one of 14 candidates for the Conservative leadership, qualifies as “fringe” is neither here nor there. The riddle is why he’s saying these things today, when they were just as true before the election. Is he only now getting around to examining the implications of his campaign promise, or did he mouth it so often in the past despite knowing it had gargantuan flaws? Related John Ivison: Trudeau was always a joke to the right; he should worry now the left’s joined in the laughter \nPersonally, as an opponent of needlessly disruptive political whims, I’m glad he changed his mind. The existing first-past-the-post system has served the country well enough that we’re the prosperous, peaceful, tolerant place we are. Trudeau has too many more demanding matters to deal with to tip the country into an unnecessary and potentially divisive effort to overhaul an unbroken system. \nWhat’s really curious is his reasoning. He’s rejecting proportional representation because it entails just the sort of broader representation he professed to desire. Rather than three parties monopolizing the stage, there would be room for smaller, less-mainstream voices. Trudeau used to claim more would be better; now he says it could be dangerous, because, we can only assume, he suddenly began to fear Canadians might listen to some of those voices. \nThe argument against proportional representation was out there all along, i.e. the current system works fine, PR has many flaws of its own, there was no outcry for reform before the Liberals made it an issue, Canadians still aren’t much interested in the debate, and we could find ourselves with a whole new system that makes decision-making harder and lends undue influence to peripheral voices. \nSo why didn’t he listen? Did he not want to hear? Had he not done his homework? Or did he figure he could use a majority to slip his preferred alternative — a system of ranking ballots that would favour the Liberals — past Canadians before they realized what had happened? \nHe says the latter is not the case. “I’m not going near it,” he said Friday of ranked ballots. “I’m not going to do something that everyone is convinced is going to favour one party over another.” \nThen why did he promote it in the first place? And if he knew it was unfair, and he’s against proportional representation, and he also doesn’t like first-past-the-post, then what’s he in favour of? There are all sorts variations on PR, some more convoluted than others. It’s possible that, given time, Canadians could have agreed on one of the existing variations, or crafted one of our own. I have my doubts about that, given how national debates have a habit of getting out of hand, but anything is possible. \nEvery political party makes mistakes, but the Liberals’ handling of this issue leaves the distinct impression that they’re happy to spout important promises on the flimsiest of pretexts, having failed to examine the consequences, thought through the procedures or delve past the shallowest levels of reasoning \nIt would have required a good deal of patience and education however: first you’d have to get voters’ interest, then you’d have to explain the alternatives, then you’d have to pick a range of options, and finally put it all to a vote. New Zealand spent two years debating and voting on a proposal to change its flag, including two referendums. If a flag justifies two years, an entire electoral overhaul should merit at least as long. But the Liberals let the clock tick away until time became a serious factor, and made it clear they were absolutely opposed to even one referendum, much less two. The fact New Zealanders eventually voted to stick with the flag they already had may have influenced that reluctance, but Trudeau’s refusal to countenance a national vote meant Canadians could have found themselves with a system they didn’t get to choose, design or vote on, pushed through before the next scheduled election for no other reason than Trudeau’s ill-judged, and evidently ill-considered, vow to do so. \nEvery political party makes mistakes, but the Liberals’ handling of this issue leaves the distinct impression that they’re happy to spout important promises on the flimsiest of pretexts, having failed to examine the consequences, thought through the procedures or delve past the shallowest levels of reasoning. Did some aide just lean over on the campaign bus one day, note that Trudeau could steal a few NDP votes if he professed to favour electoral change, and get the go-ahead right there? \nPolicy isn’t supposed to be made that way. Leaders are supposed to think about what they say before they say it. It may be that Trudeau is beginning to understand that — he did, after all, reverse the pledge rather than bull ahead blindly notwithstanding — but it took an enormous expenditure of time, money, and energy by members of all parties, not to mention the public, to open his eyes to the plainly evident. \n“This was my choice to make and I chose to make it with full consequence of the cost that is possibly going to come to it,” he said Friday. He made the right choice in the end. But it could have been made sooner and at far less cost if a little thought had gone into it first.
