Byrd, J Conrad - Just now share \nTallahassee, Fla. (970 WFLA)- Students at Florida State University in Tallahassee, vote to declare their school a sanctuary campus. \nThe referendum proposed by the FSU chapter of Students for a Democratic Society, passed with 66 percent of the vote. \nIt calls for FSU administration to agree not to share information with immigration enforcement, and agree not to take scholarships or any state tuition away from students brought to the U-S illegally as children. \nOf course, the students don't have the final say over whether FSU becomes a sanctuary campus. \nThe student government association will have to act and decide to move it forward to the university administration. \nGraphic Credit: FSU", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:02:48.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
