I was surprised there wasn't one in Halifax,\" Hollebone said.\n\"The message we want to send with this event is Canadians, and specifically the town of Wolfville, cares about this issue and is upset that the Liberals promised it and now it's not going to happen.\"\nTrudeau's promise of electoral reform: From 'we can do better' to accusations of betrayal\nDuring the federal election, Trudeau vowed to bring in a form of representation that would be in proportion to the national popular vote. On Friday, at a town hall meeting in Yellowknife, he said he preferred ranked ballots — enabling voters to rank candidates in terms of preference — but that it would favour the Liberals too much. At the end, Trudeau rejected reform, saying a referendum or proportional voting would be too divisive for Canada right now.\nVotes should have equal value That doesn't sit well with Hollebone, 18.\n\"It's important. The first-past-the-post system is unfair,\" she said.\n\"Everybody's vote isn't given the same value. It's much better to have a proportional representation system which allow people's votes to mean the same, no matter where you live in the country,\" she said.\nThe pros and cons of Canada's first-past-the-post electoral system Gillian Hollebone (Gilliane Hollebone/Facebook)\nThe number of successful female and minority candidates is higher in countries with proportional representation voting systems, such as Germany, Hollebone said.\n\"Not only did I lose a lot of trust in him, I was very saddened by his decision,\" she said of Trudeau.\nThe rally in Wolfville's Clock Park was expected to attract 30 to 40 people, including a speaker and some Acadia faculty members.\nA march to Liberal MP Scott Brison's office in Wolfville was also planned to follow the event.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:13:45.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
