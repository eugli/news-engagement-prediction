At a panel Wednesday for 13 Reasons Why, a Y.A. series coming to Netflix in March that revolves around a teen’s suicide, Selena Gomez opened up about her own mental health struggles over the years. In August, she took a 90-day respite from the public eye in order to be “proactive” about side effects of lupus, which can include anxiety, panic attacks, and depression, according to a statement from her camp at the time (she was was diagnosed with the disease in 2014). Her social-media feeds went dark during that time as well. The singer re-entered the spotlight at the end of November for the American Music Awards , but she homed in on social media as one of the more difficult aspects of her return. Gomez has been fairly open about her love-hate relationship with social media over the years. It’s an understandable tension for her (or anyone who has long-lenses constantly trained on them), as she can cause a virtual tsunami just by deleting an Instagram video of the person she’s reportedly dating . “It’s hard right now,” Gomez said, according to * The Hollywood Reporter* . “I can’t stand social media, I can’t stand what [teenagers] are looking at. I can't stand what they think is reality, and [this] show is as real as it could possibly get.” The peace she’s made with social media seems to be a precarious one. She spoke about its dangers when she made her public return at the A.M.A.s. “I don’t want to see your bodies on Instagram,” she told her impressionable fans . “I want to see what’s in here,” she continued, gesturing to her heart. At the Netflix panel, a question from the audience about her own high school experience offered a window into the roots of her mental health problems while growing up. “Whether it was just kids, or growing up in the biggest high school in the world, which was the Disney Channel, it was also adults that had the audacity to tell me how to live my life,” she said. “It was very confusing for me, it was so confusing. I had no idea who I was going to be. [The show] hits a very important part in me, and I think this is what they need to see.” Share ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T09:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:42:43.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
