John McCain, R-Ariz., Wednesday as an \"armchair warrior.\"\nThe Nation's Katrina vanden Heuvel wasn't born when the Arizona lawmaker began his career in the U.S. Navy. She was only eight-years-old when he was shot down near Hanoi and captured by the Vietnamese People's Army.\nMcCain has raised the alarm recently about Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\nRussian hackers broke into the private email accounts of Democratic National Committee staffers and Hillary Clinton 's campaign chairman, John Podesta. The hacking group WikiLeaks then published the electronic communications in installments during the presidential election.\nMcCain sees the hacks as a big deal. Some, including the Nation's editor and publisher, disagree.\n\"Will this set Armchair Warrior McCain straight?\" vanden Heuvel asked Wednesday on social media as she shared a Washington Post story titled, \"Russia's apparent meddling in U.S. election is not an act of war, cyber expert says.\"\nThe Post report quotes Michael Schmitt, chairman of the U.S. Naval War College's International Law Department, as saying the cyber attacks don't quite constitute an act of war.\n\"I'm no friend of the Russians,\" Schmitt told the paper. But the hacks are \"not an initiation of armed conflict. It's not a violation of the U.N. Charter's prohibition on the use of force. It's not a situation that would allow the U.S. to respond in self-defense militarily.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Democratic lawmaker wants White House to hire a psychiatrist, specifically for Trump \"I've concluded he is a danger to the republic.\"\nBy Anna Giaritelli • 02/08/17 4:53 PM McCain's service in the U.S. Navy began in 1958. He made his way eventually to aviation, and he flew as a pilot during the Vietnam War.\nThe 31-year-old Naval officer was shot down near Hanoi on Oct. 26, 1967, his aircraft brought down by the North Vietnamese Air Command's 61 st Battalion.\nIt was McCain's twenty-third mission.\nStruggling to regain consciousness, and discovering that he had fractures in both arms and his right leg, the Navy pilot was soon captured by North Vietnamese forces. He was beaten and bayoneted as they stripped him of his clothes.\nMcCain was then taken to a so-called hospital where he was subjected repeatedly to brutal interrogations and beatings. His captors did not treat his wounds and broken body properly, the effects of which are evident to this day .\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Trump's Nordstrom tweet raises ethics concerns Trump on Wednesday morning criticized the retailer's decision to drop his daughter Ivanka Trump's clothing line, calling it \"terrible.\"\nBy Joseph Lawler • 02/08/17 4:45 PM McCain spent the following five years being transferred from one POW camp to the next. He was put in solitary confinement, beaten, used for propaganda purposes and repeatedly tortured.\nMcCain didn't regain his freedom until March 17, 1973.\nVanden Heuvel, for her part, graduated from Princeton University in 1981 . She worked at ABC News for the next two years . She joined the Nation in 1984 as a foreign affairs assistant editor. She was promoted five years later to editor-at-large.\nShe serves now as the Nation's editor and publisher, and she writes the occasional op-ed for the Post, the New York Times and the Boston Globe.\nVanden Heuvel also once interned for National Lampoon magazine.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T23:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:04:10.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
