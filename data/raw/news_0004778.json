Let's have that discussion,\" Bowman said Friday.\nRisk of deportation\nWinnipeg has devoted considerable resources in recent years to revising its policies and building a culture of tolerance for refugees and people in the LGBT and Indigenous communities, Bowman says, citing Winnipeg's Year of Reconciliation and investment in frontline refugee initiatives as examples.\nBrian Bowman requests Winnipeg take 'as many Syrian refugees as possible' Winnipeg inner-city groups have lessons for Canada on reconciliation, researchers say \"We're going to keep looking for those opportunities to not just talk but act, and I am certainly open to having that discussion on sanctuary cities or anything else people think we should be looking at,\" he said.\nSanctuary status also generally means undocumented immigrants are protected from deportation should they come into contact with municipal police forces.\n\"The notion of a sanctuary city really isn't a concept I've heard floated in Canada before,\" Winnipeg police Chief Danny Smyth said.\n\"Whenever we have files that involve any kind of immigration issue we deal with our partners at Canada Border [Services].\"\nOrganizer glad mayor open to status Hazim Ismail, an organizer with the No Ban, No Wall event, said he is glad Bowman is open to the idea of sanctuary city status.\nIsmail was born in Malaysia but had his refugee claim accepted in Winnipeg last April.\nGay, atheist student from Malaysia has refugee claim accepted\nHazim Ismail said he hopes Mayor Brian Bowman listens to and works with groups like No One is Illegal moving forward. (Austin Grabish/CBC)\nRefugees are often more vulnerable to being exploited by employers, Ismail says, and families often encounter challenges accessing health care for their kids.\nIsmail was able to access counselling services early on after arriving in Winnipeg, but ran into trouble trying to obtain medical prescriptions for a condition known as borderline personality disorder before his claim was approved.\n\"It was hell … it was not a fun phase to be in as a refugee claimant.\"\nFor those Manitobans who believe undocumented migrants are a strain on the system, Ismail said it's important to remember how much countries around the world benefit daily from the work of financially exploited migrant labourers.\nWalk for human rights Bowman has organized a march of his own.\nHe said the tragic fatal shooting of six Muslim men in a Quebec mosque Sunday , paired with what is going on in U.S. politics right now, inspired him to organize the Winnipeg Walk for Human Rights on Saturday to bring Winnipeggers together.\nWhy accused in Quebec City mosque shooting isn't likely to face terrorism charges Families separated, students stranded: The impact of Trump's immigration ban \"This is not a protest against any one or particular thing, it's really just demonstrating to the voices of division and hate that are in all communities … that we do embrace diversity and we're simply going to stand together in a united way,\" he said.\nThere are two kinds of politicians in the world, Bowman says: \"Those who will exploit differences within a community and those who will do the heavy lifting and try and bring people together and build bridges.\n\"Winnipeggers have been doing that [heavy lifting] … and that's an ongoing thing we all need to be vigilant on. We need to speak up now more than ever on the values of diversity,\" Bowman said.\n\"We need to realize that silence is sometimes just as bad as joining the voices of hate.\"\nThe human rights march starts at The Forks at noon Saturday.\nWith files from Marcy Markusa, Bartley Kives, Nadia Kidwai and the Canadian Press", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/events/1313692268669787/?active_tab=discussion", "https://www.facebook.com/events/1331255326931578/"], "published": "2017-02-03T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:16:23.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
