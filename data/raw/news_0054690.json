Reporters and even late night comedy shows all got a good laugh out of the former governor's expressed desire to change up the way Americans measure things.\nOn Tuesday, Chafee sounded annoyed that his dream for a U.S. metric system became a punchline in newsrooms.\n\"[Reporters] immediately went to trivial things like metric,\" he said, \"and during the debate they gave me eight minutes out of two hours. The mainstream don't want to have a discussion about what happened with Iraq, and I kind of knew that going in and it was just reinforced by that experience.\"\nChafee is not just unimpressed with how reporters covered the 2016 primaries and general election. He is also annoyed with how they're covering the current administration.\n\"It's just a full onslaught against [Trump], and I think it's just kind of tiresome,\" he said in reference to the press' ongoing negative coverage of the Trump administration.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Whistleblower: VA about to toss hundreds of thousands of veteran applications \"I am sending this whistleblower disclosure to your office due to the urgent need for executive intervention.\"\nBy Pete Kasperowicz • 02/22/17 7:39 AM \"He won. I didn't vote for him, but he won. Let's let him get his feet under him, and try to build a new administration and move on,\" the former governor added.\nChafee voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the Rhode Island Democratic primary. When it came to the general election, the former governor pulled the switch for Hillary Clinton , who voted in 2003 to authorize the use of force in Iraq.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:07:47.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
