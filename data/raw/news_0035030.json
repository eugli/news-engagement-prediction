Not quite, as Zimouche tempted him to stick out his leg before putting the ball through the gap. \nThe German was left very red-faced. \nLuckily for Bellerin, the fact that Mustafi was thoroughly embarrassed meant that he didn’t have to participate. \nLet’s just hope Mustafi defends a lot better against one of the best forwards in world football - Robert Lewandowski. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
