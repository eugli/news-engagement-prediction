He is pushed around and told, \"You're not wanted here … go back home\". \nBut Busch continues on, eventually meeting his future business partner Eberhard Anheuser and presenting him with a design for a Budweiser beer. \nThe ad is not an exact record of the company's origin — Busch did not happen to run into Anheuser in St Louis as the ad suggested, but married the man's daughter and took over a small brewery acquired by Anheuser. \nThe story behind Budweiser was also fictionalised, with Busch and liquor importer Carl Conrad developing the lager several years after Anheuser's death in 1880. \nThe ad was unveiled on Tuesday, just days after Mr Trump imposed a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries to protect the nation from \"foreign terrorist entry\" . \nIts subject matter has led some viewers to suspect a hidden political message — a rebuke to Mr Trump's immigration policies. \nSome Trump supporters have called for a boycott as a result while others have criticised the company for trying to make a political statement during the Super Bowl. \n\"Budlight No thanks … it's time to #BoycottBudweiser.
