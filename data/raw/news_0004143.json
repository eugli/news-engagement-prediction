"highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "Wednesday 1 February 2017 01.02 GMT Last modified on Wednesday 1 February 2017 01.04 GMT Arsenal \nFor Arsène Wenger it has been more important to get players out of the treatment room and into contention for selection than to have made any inroads in the mid-season market. There was never any chance of him making a major signing and he has been happier to see Danny Welbeck and Per Mertesacker come back from long-term injuries. With a practically clean bill of health, Wenger has options aplenty for the business months of the season. David Hytner \nIn Cohen Bramall Hednesford Town £400,000 \nOut Dan Crowley Go Ahead Eagles loan; Chuba Akpom Brighton & Hove Albion loan; Jon Toral Rangers loan; Gedion Zelalem VVV-Venlo loan; Kaylen Hinds Stevenage loan; Stephy Mavididi Charlton loan; Marc Bola Notts County loan; Matt Macey Luton loan; Krystian Bielik Birmingham City loan Transfer deadline day: Sakho, Grosicki, Rhodes, McCormack and more – live! Read more Bournemouth \nEddie Howe warded off interest in the strikers Callum Wilson and Benik Afobe but was unable to prevent his defence from being weakened when Chelsea put an ended to Nathan Aké’s loan. Bournemouth offered to buy the Dutchman to no avail. Chelsea also refused to do a deal for the goalkeeper Asmir Begovic. Howe must delve into the squad he had before January even though the heavy defeat by Millwall in the FA Cup suggested they may not be as strong as thought. Paul Doyle \nIn None \nOut Glenn Murray Brighton & Hove Albion £3m; Nathan Aké Chelsea loan recall; Emerson Hyndman Rangers loan; Callum Buckley Aldershot Town loan; Brandon Goodship released; Jordan Lee Torquay loan; Shaun Hobson Eastbourne Borough loan; Lewis Grabban Reading loan; Jordan Green Leyton Orient loan; Joe Quigley Gillingham loan; Harry Cornick Gillingham loan; Marc Wilson West Brom loan Burnley \nBurnley spent £18m on deadline day to bring in Robbie Brady from Norwich City and Ashley Westwood from Aston Villa, having missed out on Robert Snodgrass. Those moves followed the re-signing of Joey Barton, who has already proved useful in spite of the possibility of a Football Association ban for gambling. Sean Dyche sold Danny Lafferty to Sheffield United and Lukas Jutkiewicz to Birmingham City, and allowed Chris Long to join Bolton Wanderers on loan. Paul Wilson \nIn Robbie Brady Norwich City £13m; Ashley Westwood Aston Villa £5m; Joey Barton unattached \nOut Danny Lafferty Sheffield United £50,000; Patrick Bamford loan ended; Chris Long Bolton Wanderers loan; Josh Ginnelly Lincoln City loan; Alex Whitmore Morecambe loan; George Green Salford City loan Chelsea \nChelsea ended up shedding more experienced players than even they had probably anticipated, with Mikel John Obi and Branislav Ivanovic curtailing glittering spells at Stamford Bridge, and the £58m offered by Shanghai SIPG for Oscar simply too good to turn down for both club and player. Nathan Aké returned from his loan at Bournemouth and will have a role to play but late interest in Moussa Dembélé, Sead Kolasinac and Craig Gordon came to nothing. Antonio Conte has said he is happy with the make-up of his squad and the bigger spending can wait. This team will be major players in the summer market. Dominic Fifield \nIn Nathan Aké Bournemouth loan recall; Charles Musonda Real Betis loan recall \nOut Oscar Shanghai SIPG £58m; Patrick Bamford Middlesbrough £6m; Mikel John Obi Tianjin Teda free; Branislav Ivanovic Zenit St Petersburg Town free Dion Conroy Swindon Town undisclosed; Jay Dasilva Charlton Athletic loan; Marco van Ginkel PSV Eindhoven loan; Isaiah Brown Huddersfield Town loan; Fankaty Dabo Swindon Town loan; Charlie Colkett Swindon Town loan; Islam Feruz Swindon Town loan; Fikayo Tomori Brighton & Hove Albion loan; Mukhtar Ali Vitesse Arnhem loan Crystal Palace \nSam Allardyce had pinpointed this window as key to Palace’s survival and, with results dismal up to the deadline, his judgment has been backed by the club’s owners. Patrick van Aanholt (£10m) and Jeffrey Schlupp (£9m) offer much needed balance on the left, even if neither is a natural left-back, and the frantic deals pursued on deadline day reflected the manager’s desire to add athleticism to the squad. Dominic Fifield \nIn Luka Milivojevic Olympiakos £11m; Patrick van Aanholt Sunderland £10.2m; Jeffrey Schlupp Leicester City £9m; Sullay Kaikai Brentford loan recall \nOut Freddie Ladapo Shrewsbury Town loan; Keshi Anderson Northampton Town loan; Hiram Boateng Northampton Town loan; Jordon Mutch Reading loan Everton \nTwo important, expensive sSignings in Morgan Schneiderlin and Ademola Lookman improved Ronald Koeman’s mood in a month that started with the Everton manager turning on the board and possibly the director of football, Steve Walsh, over a lack of recruits. Not that they were to blame for the FA Cup defeat by Leicester City that prompted Koeman’s outburst. The Everton manager had hoped for more – a new central defender and striker were on his wish-list – but, with a substantial amount of deadwood cleared, it was a productive window by January standards. Andy Hunter \nIn Morgan Schneiderlin Manchester United £20m; Ademola Lookman Charlton Athletic £10m; Anton Donkor Wolfsburg loan \nOut Bryan Oviedo Sunderland £5m; Darron Gibson Sunderland £2.5m; Nathan Holland West Ham undisclosed; Tom Cleverley Watford loan; Oumar Niasse Hull City loan; Gethin Jones Barnsley loan; Antony Evans Morecambe loan; Gerard Deulofeu Milan loan; Russell Griffiths Motherwell loan; Tyias Browning Preston North End loan; Delial Brewster Southport loan; Conor Grant Doncaster loan; Callum Connolly Wigan loan; Conor McAleny Oxford loan; Calum Dyson Grimsby loan Hull City \nRobert Snodgrass’s departure to West Ham represents a significant blow to Hull’s survival chances – anyone who thinks the Scotland winger is not that special has evidently not seen him play this season – and Jake Livermore’s move to West Brom hardly helped the cause either. And yet … Marco Silva built a reputation for working miracles with free transfers, loans and discards in Portugal and Greece so it will be fascinating to see how Evandro and co adapt to their new habitat. And at least Silva has been able to keep hold of the left-back Andrew Robertson. Louise Taylor \nIn Kamil Grosicki Rennes £7m; Markus Henriksen AZ Alkmaar £4.5m; Evandro Porto £1.1m; Oumar Niasse Everton loan; Omar Elabdellaoui Olympiakos loan; Lazar Markovic Liverpool loan; Andrea Ranocchia Internazionale loan; Alfred N’Diaye Villarreal loan \nOut Robert Snodgrass West Ham £10.2m; Jake Livermore West Brom £10m; Harvey Rodgers Accrington Stanley loan; Jonathan Edwards Accrington Stanley loan; Allan McGregor Cardiff City loan; Johan Ter Horst York City loan; Alex Bruce Wigan loan; James Weir Wigan loan Leicester City \nA frustrating month for Leicester on and off the field. Wilfred Ndidi arrived from Genk in a £15m deal that was approved before the window opened but Leicester secured only one further signing, the central defender Molla Wagué, whose loan from Udinese was confirmed around an hour before the deadline. Significantly, the Premier League champions missed out on signing Middlesbrough’s Gastón Ramírez. The main talking point, though, was Leonardo Ulloa’s threat to go on strike after Sunderland’s offers were rejected. Stuart James \nIn Wilfred Ndidi KRC Genk £15m; Molla Wagué Udinese loan \nOut Jeffrey Schlupp Crystal Palace £9m; Luis Hernández Málaga £1.6m; Harvey Barnes MK Dons loan; Matty James Barnsley loan; Callum Elder Barnsley loan Liverpool \nJürgen Klopp had warned it would be a quiet January on the not unreasonable basis that his leading targets to improve Liverpool – Borussia Dortmund’s Christian Pulisic, for example – were not available. The manager was praised for his careful, long-term transfer strategy when his team were swotting aside allcomers in the first half of the season. With momentum suddenly checked this month, and Liverpool’s squad struggling to compensate for the loss of Sadio Mané or Joël Matip, that approach has attracted fierce criticism. Klopp insists the lack of incoming players was not for the want of trying. Andy Hunter \nIn Sam Hart Port Vale loan recall \nOut Tiago Ilori Reading £3.8m; Joe Maguire Fleetwood £50,000; Pedro Chirivella Go Ahead Eagles loan; Lazar Markovic Hull City loan; Cameron Brannagan Fleetwood Town loan Manchester City \nPep Guardiola would have loved to have acquired a full-back on either flank or even one of each and strengthened in central defence. Instead, in the quietest of windows for City, their best bit of business is something that did not happen: Tosin Adarabioyo, who has six months remaining on his terms will not leave and there is confidence the 19-year-old defender will agree a new deal. Expect the summer to be the time when Guardiola makes serious moves in the market. Jamie Jackson \nIn Gabriel Jesus Palmeiras £27m \nOut Bismark Adjei-Boateng Colorado Rapids £490,000; Ian Lawlor Doncaster £40,000; George Glendon Fleetwood Town free; Pablo Maffeo Girona loan; Angelino Girona loan; Manu García NAC Breda loan; Bruno Zuculini Hellas Verona loan; Billy O’Brien St Mirren loan; David Faupala Chesterfield loan Manchester United \nThe winter window came and went and Bastian Schweinsteiger remained at the club. After being frozen out, the German is back in the Premier League and Europa League squads. José Mourinho allowed Morgan Schneiderlin to move to Everton and Memphis Depay to Lyon. To the manager’s delight Ashley Young remained despite the forward considering his future and Wayne Rooney is also staying. Regarding the latter, it would be a surprise if he is still at Old Trafford by the close of the summer transfer window. Jamie Jackson \nIn Joel Castro Pereira Belenenses loan recall \nOut Morgan Schneiderlin Everton £20m; Memphis Depay Lyon £14.8m; Sean Goss Queens Park Rangers £500,000; Sam Johnstone Aston Villa loan; Joe Riley Sheffield United loan Middlesbrough \nOh, dear. Aitor Karanka is a deeply unhappy bunny, minded to hurl his toys out of the pram after his board’s failure to sign his principal targets, Robert Snodgrass, Jesé and Bojan Krkic. How will the relationship with Steve Gibson, the club’s owner, that Karanka has always termed “amazing” and Neil Bausor, the chief executive, unfold now? With the signings Rudy Gestede, Patrick Bamford and Adlène Guedioura surely destined to be more squad players than assured starters, the manager’s only consolation is keeping the unsettled Gastón Ramírez out of Leicester City’s clutches. Louise Taylor \nIn Rudy Gestede Aston Villa £6m; Patrick Bamford Chelsea £6m; Adlène Guedioura Watford £4m; Mikael Soisalo Ilves Tampere £170,000 \nOut David Nugent Derby £2.5m; Emilio Nsue Birmingham £1m; Arnel Jakupovic Empoli £860,000; Jonny Burn Bristol Rovers £60,000; Bryn Morris Shrewsbury free; Mark Kitching Rochdale undisclosed; Julien De Sart Derby loan; Tomás Mejías Rayo Vallecano loan; Carlos de Pena Real Oviedo loan; Callum Cooke Crewe loan Southampton \nSaints’ biggest problem has been wastefulness in front of goal, especially since Charlie Austin dislocated his shoulder in December. The club addressed that on deadline day by landing Manolo Gabbiadini from Napoli. Defensively, the performances of Maya Yoshida and Jack Stephens over the past month suggest Southampton can cope at the back despite the sale of José Fonte to West Ham, particularly as they held on to the jewel in their crown, Virgil van Dijk. Paul Doyle \nIn Manolo Gabbiadini Napoli £14m; Mouez Hassen Nice loan \nOut José Fonte West Ham £8m; Jason McCarthy Walsall loan; Dominic Gape Wycombe loan Stoke City \nThe saga is over. Saido Berahino, who had been on Stoke’s radar for more than 12 months, finally moved to the Potteries in a £12m deal. Stoke hope Berahino will become a 20-goal-a-season striker and solve what has long been a problematic position for them. They also tied up a permanent deal for the goalkeeper Lee Grant. Bojan Krkic, who has been out of form, was the one high-profile departure. Stuart James \nIn Saido Berahino West Brom £12m; Lee Grant Derby County £1.3m \nOut Jakob Haugaard Wigan Athletic loan; Ryan Sweeney Bristol Rovers loan; Ollie Shenton Wrexham loan; Joel Taylor Rochdale loan; Dionatan Teixeira released; Moha El Ouriachi Heart of Midlothian loan; Bojan Krkic Mainz loan; Sergio Molina Albacete undisclosed; George Waring Carlisle loan Sunderland \nWell, at least David Moyes kept Jermain Defoe. That represents the principal consolation at the end of a window in which Moyes upped Sunderland’s contingent of players with whom he previously worked at Everton and Manchester United to 10. Not that Wearsiders exactly had the bunting out to greet Joleon Lescott, Darron Gibson and Bryan Oviedo. If the money Crystal Palace paid for Patrick van Aanholt – a left-back who cannot defend – seems too good to turn down, Van Aanholt was pretty useful going forward and may be missed. With Victor Anichebe injured, the biggest disappointment was the failure to sign a new attacking partner for Defoe. Louise Taylor \nIn Bryan Oviedo Everton £5m; Darron Gibson Everton £2.5m; Joleon Lescott unattached \nOut Patrick van Aanholt Crystal Palace £10.2m; Andrew Nelson Hartlepool loan; Tom Beadling Bury loan Swansea City \nDesperate for new faces to boost their survival hopes, Swansea have enjoyed a productive window. Tom Carroll, who joined from Tottenham, was excellent on his debut in the win over Liverpool. Martin Olsson is an upgrade at left-back, Luciano Narsingh should offer more of a threat on the flank and Jordan Ayew will provide options across the front once he returns from the Africa Cup of Nations. The one negative for the new manager, Paul Clement, is the failure to bring in a new centre-back. Stuart James \nIn Tom Carroll Tottenham Hotspur £5m; Luciano Narsingh PSV Eindhoven £4m; Martin Olsson Norwich City £4m; Jordan Ayew Aston Villa £5m plus Neil Taylor \nOut Marvin Emnes Blackburn loan; Neil Taylor Aston Villa swap deal; Modou Barrow Leeds United loan; Ryan Hedges Barnsley undisclosed; Owain Jones Yeovil Town loan Tottenham Hotspur \nMauricio Pochettino was clear and consistent from the first day of January. Tottenham, he said, would be open to doing business if something attractive came up and it represented an upgrade but if there was nothing, then so be it. There was nothing. The manager raised £5m from the sale of the midfielder Tom Carroll to Swansea and he loaned out a couple of youngsters but he will push on with the players in whom he has invested great trust. David Hytner \nIn None \nOut Tom Carroll Swansea City £5m; Ryan Loft Stevenage loan; Shayon Harrison Yeovil Town loan; Connor Ogilvie Stevenage loan; Anton Walkes Atlanta United loan; Luke Amos Southend United loan Watford \nThe further the team’s form has plummeted in the past two months, the more muddled their play has looked but Walter Mazzarri seems to have decided that the main way to improve that was to sign a prolific striker. M’Baye Niang does not fit that bill yet, which is why Milan let him go to Vicarage Road, but he certainly has rich potential and, if he fulfils it, will carry more of a threat than Odion Ighalo, whose move to China was confirmed on deadline day. Costel Pantilimon’s injury in the FA Cup defeat at Millwall meant goalkeeper was a position that needed reinforcing, too. Central defence still looks a little brittle. The other notable departure yesterday was Adlène Guedioura to Middlesbrough. Paul Doyle \nIn Mauro Zárate Fiorentina £2.3m; Tom Cleverley Everton loan; M’Baye Niang Milan loan \nOut Odion Ighalo Changchun Yatai £17.1m; Adlène Guedioura Middlesbrough £4m; Adalberto Peñaranda Málaga loan; Obbi Oulare Willem ll loan; Alex Jakubiak Wycombe Wanderers loan; Jerome Sinclair Birmingham City loan; Michael Folivi Coventry loan West Brom \nIt was a frustrating transfer window for Tony Pulis, who suggested he was a victim of his own success because Albion’s lofty league position made it difficult to find players who could be classed as upgrades. Finally selling Saido Berahino was, at least, in the best interests of all concerned but Albion needed to recruit a potent striker to make a big difference to their campaign. Pulis explored many striking options but was not able to secure any of his targets, nor was he able to add another wide player to his team’s armoury. Jake Livermore is a positive signing but hardly a transformative one. Paul Doyle \nIn Jake Livermore Hull City £10m; Marc Wilson Bournemouth loan \nOut Saido Berahino Stoke City £12m; Callum McManaman Sheffield Wednesday loan; Craig Gardner Birmingham City loan; Tyler Roberts Shrewsbury Town loan; Andre Wright Yeovil Town loan; Tahvon Campbell Notts County loan West Ham United \nThe window was dominated by the Dimitri Payet saga, with the unsettled French midfielder finally getting his move back to Marseille when a £25m fee was agreed for him on Sunday. Robert Snodgrass has arrived from Hull City to fill the creative void left by Payet’s departure, while Angelo Ogbonna’s knee injury necessitated a move for the Southampton centre-back José Fonte. But interest in the Brentford striker Scott Hogan waned and West Ham have still not resolved their weakness at right-back. Jacob Steinberg \nIn Robert Snodgrass Hull City £10.2m; José Fonte Southampton £8m; Nathan Holland Everton undisclosed \nOut Dimitri Payet Marseille £25m; Lewis Page Charlton Athletic £500,000; Martin Samuelsen Peterborough United loan; Sam Howes Hampton & Richmond Borough loan; Alex Pike Cheltenham Town loan; Simone Zaza loan recall; Marcus Browne Wigan Athletic loan; Toni Martínez Oxford United loan; Reece Oxford Reading loan", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:16:42.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
