On this occasion, he edged one from James Anderson, again in the cordon. \nVs England, Lord's (2014): During that forgettable tour to England, Kohli was dismissed for his Test career's third duck when he was bowled by Liam Plunkett for a first-ball duck in India's second innings. \nVs Australia, Melbourne (December 2011): Playing his first Test in Australia, Kohli was trapped in front of the wicket by Ben Hilfenhaus off the first ball. \nVs West Indies, Bridgetown (June 2011): Playing his second Test match, Kohli was dismissed by Ravi Rampaul for a duck after facing two balls in the first innings.
