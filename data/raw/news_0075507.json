Slaughter capped the scoring in the inning with a two-run double. \nKEY TEAM STATISTICS \nLSU had season-highs in runs with 14 and hits with 18. . .Every Tigers starter except for Smith had a hit. . .LSU tied the school record for triples in a game with three – all coming in the third inning.

Smith, who was playing shortstop dove and caught the ball, but he had nothing on the throw. Jancarski would have beaten out the ball even if Smith had made a strong throw. Poche walked only two batters and struck out six. He did not allow a runner past first base until the eighth inning. Poche threw a seven-inning no-hitter against Army last Saturday. \nPoche’s comments: “Coach (Paul) Mainieri asked me how I felt after the seventh inning. I told him that I was better than I was at the beginning of the game. I had better stuff today than I did last week. I don’t know if it was meant to be today. That’s how baseball works.” \nNOTES \nWoley got his first start as the designated hitter. Bryce Adams had been the starting DH for the first six games. With a righthanded pitcher starting for Maryland, Breaux was the starting leftfielder. . .Slaughter has hit safely in all seven games this season. . .Deichmann tied the school record for sacrifice flies in a game with two. Several players are tied for the record with the most recent being Alex Bregman against Arkansas two seasons ago. . .Duplantis matched his career-high with three runs scored. He has scored three runs in a game three times in his career. . .Watson’s pinch-hit double was the first of his career. . .Russell Reynolds replaced Poche after Jancarski opened the ninth with a single. Reynolds walked one and got three outs in ground balls. . .LSU is 6-1 overall, while Maryland is 1-4. . .The paid attendance was 10,608. The actual crowd was about 6,300. . .Eric Walker will be the starting pitcher for the Tigers against Maryland on Sunday. \nFROM THE LOCKER ROOM \nCoach Paul Mainieri’s comments: “I had never had a no-hitter in 35 years of coaching. So, I didn’t think I would see it in back-to-back games. Jared may have done it were it not for an infield single. That was quite amazing. His pitch count was not too high. If his pitch count had gone beyond what we wanted it to be, we would have taken him out. We really swung the bats extremely well. We focused on hitting the ball to the opposite field.” \nUP NEXT \nLSU will play host to Maryland at The Box in the series finale Sunday. First pitch is scheduled for 11 a.m. Central. The LSU-Maryland game will be available on the SEC Digital Network.
