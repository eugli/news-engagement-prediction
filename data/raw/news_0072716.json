The police officers are accused of kidnapping and extorting the family by making promises of crossing them to Texas after a ransom was paid off. The agents had locked up the family at a stash house in this border city.\nSources within the Coahuila Attorney General’s Office (PGJE) confirmed to Breitbart Texas that this week that members of the PGJE Investigative Police Unit carried out a raid at the stash house where the Fuerza Coahuila members had allegedly been holding the family. The operation was kicked off after a Central American woman contacted authorities about the kidnapping of her family, The PGJE investigators arrested the two Fuerza Coahuila officers at the stash house.\nThe border city of Piedras Negras is used by drug cartels and human smuggling groups as a stepping point for entering Texas. The lack of border security in the area has allowed groups like Los Zetas — now called Cartel Del Noreste, to move ton quantities of cocaine and thousands of illegal immigrants with minimal difficulties.\nThe two police officers from Fuerza Coahuila whose names have not been publicly revealed were taken to the Piedras Negras state prison. Breitbart Texas was able to obtain an exclusive leaked photograph of one of the alleged kidnappers.\nEditor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities. The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.
