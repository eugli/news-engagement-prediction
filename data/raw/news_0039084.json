Many believe race played a factor in Adele’s win. \n\nThe Grammys are now addressing this widespread belief, with Grammy boss Neil Portnow saying it’s simply a numbers game, and industry members should use their voting power to bring about change, according to MSN. \n“I understand that people might feel left out, but it's really simple: Participate and vote, and then you're part of the conversation. Not only do we encourage and welcome that, we need it.\" \nCredit: Getty \nCurrent academy voters simply have a problem rewarding hip hop and “urban\" records, inadvertently creating a racial gap that becomes more obvious as the years go on. \n\"I don't hate the Grammys, but I didn't even watch this year for this very reason,\" says Stephen \"Thundercat\" Bruner, who contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly , which won five Grammys but lost album of the year in 2016 to Taylor Swift's 1989. \nCredit: Getty \nStill, the decision ultimately lies with the voters, and singer Terrace Martin has no problem calling out his peers for their lack of participation. \n\"Most of the people complaining are motherf—kers who don't vote! When I go to Recording Academy events, I'm the only one there with tattoos on my neck. I'm trying to get my friends to vote. Everybody acts like they don't give a f—k about the Grammys — until the Grammys come around.” \nCredit: Getty Images \nIn addition to race, generational gaps also play a factor, as old school voters still prefer a more classic approach to making records. \n\"They'll say 'I can't play \"Formation\" on the piano, but I can play \"Hello,” admitted Helen Bruner, a member of the academy’s constituency. \nCredit: Getty Images \nDo you believe it’s all about voting or is prejudice built into the system at this point?
