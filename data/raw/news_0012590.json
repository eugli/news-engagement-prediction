Advisers continue to jockey for power in the West Wing. So who is on top? by Stephen Bannon, left, and Reince Priebus, right, at a meeting with Donald Trump at the White House on February 1, 2017. From Bloomberg/Getty Images. Since President Donald Trump began his tenure as the leader of the free world a little more than two weeks ago, his top aides have been jockeying for a greater share of power and influence in what has amounted to the juiciest, and most high stakes, season yet of The Apprentice . Like all truly great reality casts, the members of Trump’s inner circle have been busy figuring out each other’s weaknesses and harnessing their strengths, occasionally, it seems, with well-chiseled picks. And whereas reality-TV viewers traditionally expect to read gossip about their favorite characters in the pages of Us or In Touch , fearful members of the republic now expect similarly dishy stories in The Wall Street Journal , The New York Times , and The Washington Post , all of which published alarming (and, at times, scarily amusing) reports this weekend illuminating the latest pecking order inside the West Wing. In particular, reports focused on the fraught relationship between chief strategist Stephen Bannon and chief of staff Reince Priebus , Trump’s envoy to his base and party, respectively. During Trump’s first fortnight in power, the two appeared to represent opposing alter-egos within Trump’s brain, which makes them indispensable. They won the chance to accompany the president this weekend to Mar-a-Lago, where he spent his third weekend in office. Even though the stakes are far different, it was hard to disabuse oneself of the notion that Trump was planning some version of a West Wing rose ceremony. Even though politics, unlike reality TV, is not a zero sum game (at least for now), shrewd viewers may wonder the inevitable: who, Priebus or Bannon, is likely to win the rose. Priebus, according to a report from The Washington Post , has taken a greater share of control back from Bannon, who, straight out of the gate, took the reins to push through a series of executive orders in line with his nationalist vision. Bannon, for example, was credited with the “extreme vetting” order, which temporarily bans individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries and bars refugees from entering the U.S. The order, itself, has been temporarily halted by a court ruling, which has merely exacerbated the disastrous rollout. Key Cabinet secretaries and government agencies said they did not have the appropriate amount of time to vet the measure, which is perhaps why a number of judges across the country have halted the ban, questioning its legality. A constitutional crisis is not exactly the image an incoming administration wants to portray in its first week. Ever since, Priebus has flexed his muscle in the West Wing. According to the Post , he has tried to get the White House into a rhythm, slowed the breakneck pace of executive orders, and has asserted that he needs more control over communication between agencies and the policy process in general. According to another report from The New York Times published on Sunday, Priebus has implemented a 10-point checklist that new initiatives must go through in order to avoid the kind of mess the so-called Muslim ban created for the administration to try to clean up. This does not mean that Bannon’s role, a position so great that it earned him the title of “The Great Manipulator” on the cover of Time magazine, has necessarily diminished. Bannon noted to the Post that key advisers have simply figured out how to work together to get what they want. “Some of us are a little more aggressive than others, and others have a more calming influence, and it’s what makes a perfect partnership,” Bannon told the paper. “There’s no daylight between us, and there’s really no daylight with the president.” Priebus went further in trying to show just how well everyone is getting along. “We basically live together, and we’re on the same page with everything,” Priebus told the Post , referring to himself, his deputy Katie Walsh , Bannon, and his right-hand man Stephen Miller. “The four of us have become super tight. I think we’ve figured out where a lot of our strengths are at.” There are a couple of names left out of that new power clique. Both Kellyanne Conway and Jared Kushner also entered the inauguration as key, and seemingly equal, members of the inner circle. But the most recent reports suggest that the two have moved further in the background. The Post noted that Conway has been taking a “behind-the-scenes role shaping communications strategy,” but she was not mentioned by Bannon or Priebus. Kushner, who is both Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, appears to have shrunk even further from view. The Times noted that while he has been at most of the president’s most important meetings and events, he has also spent time ingratiating himself into Washington society and spending time with his young family in their new home. Kushner, an observant Jew who does not work on Shabbat, is also out of pocket from sundown on Fridays through sundown on Saturdays. Last week, a source told me that he was “furious” with his father-in-law, when Trump blew up a meeting with the Mexican president with a string of tweets—a meeting Kushner had painstakingly spent 24 hours trying to put together. This has left space in the inner circle for someone else to sweep up, and according to the Times , Bannon wasted no time in doing just that. “Bannon has rushed into the vacuum, telling allies that he and Mr. Miller have a brief window in which to push through their vision of Mr. Trump’s economic nationalism,” the paper reported. It is worth noting that Kushner and Conway were not quoted on the record for these reports. Bannon, Priebus, Miller, and Walsh all were. No one knows better than Trump, who used to call gossip columnists disguised as his own P.R. man, how to spin. So perhaps that is the best strategy in this edition of The Apprentice . But this leaves out one key member of the cast, who seems to have the most access of all. According to the Times , it is Trump’s longtime former security chief, Keith Schiller , who catches the president in his solitary, late-night moments in the residence, traipsing around in a bathrobe, watching cable news. That kind of loyalty makes a winner in Trump’s world. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T21:32:29.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
