This year’s spring catalog states a Gladiolus \"Mexicana\" that may \"now be appropriate … outside … Donald Trump’s White House\" and also references Trump in its description of the Arisaema \"Trumpeteer.\" \n\"Because of its hairy top, sharp tongue and prickly nature, Arisaema Trumpeter is a selection you’ll either love or hate,\" Avent said. \nHe said he plans to continue planting barbs in his catalog descriptions, but he took down the reference that sparked the weekend outcry, saying he has learned that cultural context counts. \n\"The key is, when you hear something like that and realize it's being taken wrong, you get it out of there,\" he said. \nSeveral of the people who commented online said they appreciate Avent clarifying and removing the post.
