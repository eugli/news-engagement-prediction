It disappeared underwater when the boats passed, and it only appeared when the water was quiet.\n\"We were really shocked. I've worked here for three years and I've never seen one here before, and my colleague has been here longer and she's never seen one either.\n\"It headed towards Tower Bridge. I hope it will be alright.\"\n– Lottie McCullagh, Thames Rib Experience shore staff The most famous visitor to the Thames in recent years was a five metre long bottlenose whale spotted in January 2006. Sadly the whale died as attempts were made to rescue her and return her to the sea.\nThe bottlenose whale spotted in the Thames in 2006 Credit: ITN A rescue attempt was made to save the whale found in the Thames in 2006 Credit: ITN Last updated Sun 26 Feb 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:05:50.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
