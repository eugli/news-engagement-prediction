But in the coming election in this northern city, long dominated by the traditionally working-class party, he is switching allegiance. \n“I think Labour has had it too long around here,” said the 54-year-old Mr. Kemp, who was laid off last year from a catering job and hasn’t found new work. “They’ve lost touch with the people.” \nLabour’s struggles in postindustrial areas like Stoke-on-Trent, the bedrock of its support for more than 50 years, illustrate how dramatically the political landscape has shifted in the wake of Britain’s movement to leave the European Union . \nThe center-left party, which reinvigorated itself in the 1990s by reaching out to cosmopolitan Britons, is scrambling to hold on in areas where voters, including Mr. Kemp, widely supported Brexit and feel left behind as London’s economy surges . Leonard Bradbury, unemployed after suffering a workplace injury, at home Monday in Stoke-on-Trent, still known as the Potteries for its once-strong pottery industry. A stuffed rabbit on display expresses his dislike for former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \nThey are increasingly turning to the anti-EU UK Independence Party and even Prime Minister Theresa May ’s Conservatives, long anathema to large swaths of northern England, as she pushes forward with plans for a definitive break from the EU . \nStoke-on-Trent voted in favor of Brexit by one of largest majorities in the country, defying Labour’s pro-EU stance. Thursday’s by-elections here and in Copeland, another northern constituency, will give an early indication of support for Mrs. May’s strategy—as well as Labour’s future in the region. \nThough there have been no public polls in either constituency, they are expected to be close races. \nAmong working-class voters nationally, the Labour Party, with just 23% support, was neck-and-neck with UKIP and far behind the Conservatives, according to a poll by YouGov PLC published Friday. That is down from 31% nearly two years ago. Among all voters, Labour polled about the same while UKIP’s support fell to 15%. \nA former hub for British pottery making and coal mining known as “the Potteries,” Stoke-on-Trent has floundered in a global economy. Unemployment was at 6.2% as of September, above the U.K. average of 4.8%, according to the most recent data available. \nIn the town center, vendors sold items like hair extensions, fruit and vegetables and roast chicken, while empty storefronts and run-down buildings marked some streets. Reflecting on the scene, Mr. Kemp had a simple explanation for turning to the centrist Liberal Democrat party: “Look at the state of this town—it is in shambles.” \nThe election here is wide open after incumbent Labour lawmaker Tristram Hunt quit to head the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. The main rival to Labour candidate Gareth Snell is Paul Nuttall, the leader of UKIP . \nMr. Snell turned down requests for comment. If Mr. Nuttall won, it would be only the second seat for UKIP in Parliament. \nJack Dromey, a Labour member of Parliament who campaigned in Stoke-on-Trent last weekend, said his party needed to regain the trust of working-class people in the north and ensure that it isn’t viewed as London-centric. \n“There is a big challenge for Labour at the next stage,” he said. He also accused UKIP of seeking “to exploit discontent. It is an ugly, divisive politics.” \nNigel Farage, the former leader of UKIP and one of the drivers behind Britain’s vote to leave the EU, said Labour is facing an existential crisis. \n“This is about dissatisfaction,” Mr. Farage said in a recent interview. “Are they a party of North London intellectuals, or are they a party of postindustrial Britain in the Midlands and the North?” \nOther center-left parties in Europe are going through similar upheavals, and there are parallels in the U.S. Just as the Brexit campaign drew support from working-class Labour voters, President Donald Trump found backing in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin—which went Republican for the first time in about three decades. \nUKIP appeals to some Labour voters, but while the party has risen in popularity, it has also struggled with internal scandals and is still trying to define itself beyond its opposition to the EU and immigration.

Annette Wareham, a shop assistant, standing outside her home on Monday, said she used to vote for Labour but won’t this time. \nLabour faces a much bigger threat from the Conservatives. ​ \nMrs. May, who campaigned in Stoke-on-Trent on Monday, has made clear she is actively pursuing Labour’s core voters, saying she wants to make life better for people who are “just about managing.” \nHer message is resonating with voters like Alan Jervis, 69. “I know the Conservatives look after the rich and I’m only working class, but I just think they’re better with the economy,” said Mr. Jervis, who was let go from his job at a pottery company after 33 years. \nAnnette Wareham, a 53-year-old shop assistant who voted for Brexit, said she used to vote for Labour but won’t in this election. \n“They give you all these promises and never go through with it,” said Ms. Wareham, who is concerned about worsening poverty in the subsidized housing where she lives. She is wavering between UKIP and the Liberal Democrats, a small party that has been bringing up the rear in polls. UKIP could win its second seat in the U.K. Parliament in a by-election sparked by the resignation of the Labour Party incumbent in Stoke-on-Trent. \nWrite to Jenny Gross at Election to Test Depth of U.K. Labour Party’s Decline By ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:31:33.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
