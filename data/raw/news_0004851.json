Sapsiwai via Getty Images \nBy studying the minerals on the island Mauritius they found that something was amiss with its age. \n“Earth is made up of two parts – continents, which are old, and oceans, which are “young”. On the continents you find rocks that are over four billion years old, but you find nothing like that in the oceans, as this is where new rocks are formed,” explains Professor Lewis Ashwal, lead author on the paper. \n“Mauritius is an island, and there is no rock older than 9 million years old on the island. However, by studying the rocks on the island, we have found zircons that are as old as 3 billion years.” \nZircons are minerals which survive mostly in the type of granite that you find in continents. They’re incredibly durable which makes them perfect for taking precise dating.

The split-up occurred because of the geological process of plate tectonics. This is the process where the ocean basin is in continuous motion, and moves between 2 cm and 11 cm per year. Continents ride on the plates that make up the ocean floor, which causes the movement of the continents. \n(Wits University)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T13:03:48.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
