The Navy SEAL was one of about 30 killed during the raid last weekend, including 14 militants and multiple woman and children.

The president later spent a couple hours with Owens' family at the base.\n\"I just returned from an amazing visit with a great, great family at Dover,\" he said later that day while swearing in Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. \"It is something very sad, very beautiful.
