The day finally came where we met the tattoo guy!! A\" \nTheir fans couldn't handle it. \nOne wrote: \"Is that a compliment? Your faces are on his a**e!\" \nAnd others simply expressed how much they were laughing. The Geordie duo finally met up with their superfan (Photo: ITV) \nSuperfan Lee, 28, asked tattoo artist Steve Bell to put the Geordie duo on his posterior. \nThe tattooist who inked the stars eating spaghetti on his customer's buttocks said the job took two and a half hours per cheek. \nMr Bell, who runs the Clockwork Orange parlour in Norton, Teesside, broke his hand half way through the job so for some months Mr Crane had just Ant on one buttock. \nMr Bell had seen a photo of Ant and Dec recreating the Lady and the Tramp spaghetti-eating scene and suggested it to his client.
