The airline plans to use their A350-900 aircraft on the route. Cathay’s A350-900 is a 3 class aircraft with 38 lie-flat Business Class seats, 28 Premium Economy and 214 Economy seats. Cathay A350 (Image – Cathay Pacific) \nAt this stage the airline will run the service 3 times weekly, here is the following schedule: \nCX123 leaves Hong Kong at 2:50 PM and arrives into Christchurch at 7:00 AM+1 \nCX126 leaves Christchurch at 2:25 PM and arrives into Hong Kong at 8:55 PM \nThis is the 3rd pacific region to get the Cathay A350, Auckland got it late last year, Melbourne got it at the start of the month and Brisbane will get it late next month. \nHow can I fly with points? \nThere are few great ways you can fly Cathay’s new A350 to or from Christchurch with points. As this has just been announced the flights aren’t yet showing availability but I’d imagine there will be a lot of space free once it does open. \nAsia Miles – Asia Miles charge 45,000 miles roundtrip in Economy, 54,000 miles round trip in Premium Economy and 80,000 in Business Class.
