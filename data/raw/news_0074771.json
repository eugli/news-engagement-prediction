Soon I will be too.” \nTony Moreno, 23, of Middletown, Connecticut, was convicted of murder yesterday, reports The Sun . Aaden Moreno was found two days after he was murdered. Picture: Connecticut State Police Source: Supplied \nHe faces up to 70 years in prison when he’s sentenced in May. \nMoreno threw the child off the Arrigoni Bridge that spans the Connecticut River between Middletown and Portland on July 15, 2015, and then jumped intending to kill himself. Tony Moreno demonstrates to the jury how he held his son Aaden on the railing of the Arrigoni Bridge in the final moments of Aaden's life, during Moreno's trial.

Aaden’s body was found by a kayaker 22 kilometres downstream two days later. \nMoreno testified in his own defence, claiming the baby slipped from his arms and he never intended to harm him. \nHe was pictured in court cradling a toy doll to demonstrate how he held his son on the bridge’s railing. Moreno in court with the doll.

The two shared custody of Aaden. \nA police officer and a hospital psychiatrist testified that Moreno made statements indicating that he had killed the child. \nProsecutors also introduced text messages between Moreno and Oyola as evidence, including one where in response to a question about Aaden’s whereabouts. \nMoreno wrote: “He’s dead. Soon I will be too.” \nShe replied: “You couldn’t kill your own son. Please don’t hurt Aaden!!!” Adrianne Oyola testifies during Tony Moreno's murder trial. Picture: AP Source: AP \nMiddletown police officer Austin Smith went to the Arrigoni Bridge after Tony Moreno’s mother alerted police that he was distressed. \nJurors heard a 911 call in which Denise Moreno told dispatchers her son said he was going to jump from the bridge and that he was with his son. \nSmith said he arrived at the scene around the same time as Moreno’s mother and brother. \nThe cop testified that he shouted “Tony, stop!” before Moreno climbed over a railing and jumped. \nHe said there was an empty stroller but the infant could not be found, despite searches for the boy. \nDefence lawyer Norman Pattis said the verdict was disappointing. \nThis article originally appeared on The Sun .
