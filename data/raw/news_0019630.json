Miss Hargreaves had a history of epilepsy. She returned home from her nursing course in Leeds because it was believed the stress was causing her condition to get worse. The night before her death Miss Hargreaves went out to a nightclub with her sister and a group of friends. The student was found dead in bed by her sister Hannah with her mobile phone next to her. A medical cause of death was given as cocaine use That night Miss Hargreaves drank six vodka lemonades - and then confided in her sister Hannah that she had taken cocaine. Hannah a graphic design student said: 'Penny wasn't a regular drug user, it was more of an impulse. 'She didn't really like drugs, it was just after a couple of drinks she would say \"oh I could really go for some coke now.\" It wasn't an addiction it was recreational.' At 2.30am, Miss Hargreaves got home with her friends and they agreed to purchase three grams of cocaine costing £100 between them. The drugs were laid out on a plate on the table and racked up into lines. At her inquest in Blackburn, coroner Michael Singleton condemned recreational drug use as 'acts of crass stupidity' saying he was 'blown away' by the number of people who took cocaine without knowing what was in it The inquest heard Hannah, who shared the house with Miss Hargreaves, got back at about 5am to see her sister still up and her friends there. She said she herself didn't take any cocaine and went to bed instead with her boyfriend after they ordered a takeaway. The group stayed up throughout Sunday before leaving on Monday morning. Miss Hargreaves was later found dead. WHAT IS LEVAMISOLE? Levamisole is used to treat parasitic worm infections Levamisole is a medication used to treat parasitic worm infections. Once used as a topical cancer treatment, the medicine has since been banned for use in humans after it was found to cause the death of healthy skin tissue, sometimes resulting in livid, purple wounds. In 2014 a Government report claimed four fifths of all cocaine smuggled into Britain was laced with Levamisole. When asked about the last time she saw her sister, Hannah said: 'She was happy and she was laughing. She didn't seem like she was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. She was happy she could walk in a straight line and she was talking properly. 'She didn't seem like a typical drunk person. She seemed happy and cheerful. I heard her on the Sunday evening when her friends left but I never actually saw her. 'I could hear her, she was very distinct in the way she walked she was heavy on her feet when she walked in the house. I heard her speak as well as she had a distinct voice.' Friend Kevin Wilkinson said he went to purchase the drugs. He said: 'The cocaine got put out on a plate on the table and racked up for everyone to have. It was cut into lines. I left at around 9.30 or 10am on the Monday. 'On Sunday we bought loads of beers and got really drunk. Penny was with us. She was drinking the beers and snorting the cocaine. 'She was bubbly and chirpy and couldn't do enough for anyone type of thing. She was the one who was up in the kitchen saying to us \"why are you all sat down for\".' The coroner asked Mr Wilkinson if he knew what he was buying. The night before her death Miss Hargreaves had been at a nightclub with a group of friends. When they got home thay agreed to purchase three grams of cocaine costing £100 between them He said: 'Are you a pharmacist? No? Then how did you know what you were buying. You purchased bags of white powder from someone who was at best a drug dealer and at worst a fraudster, which you believed was cocaine.' Dr Muamar Al-Mudhaffer a Consultant Histopathologist said Miss Hargreaves' cause of death was cocaine use and said he could find no signs of an epileptic fit in his post mortem examination. She also had therapeutic levels of anti-epileptic medication in her blood, along with alcohol and paracetamol. Miss Hargreaves who had a history of epilepsy had been a nursing student at Leeds University Dr Al-Mudhaffer added: 'It is likely that she had taken cocaine in the hours leading up to her death for it to still be in her blood. Cocaine has side effects of increasing heart rate and palpitations, which can cause a heart attack. 'The reaction to cocaine is unpredictable. There is no safe level of cocaine because it can trigger sudden cardiac arrest, a raise in blood pressure and cause death. The evidence of alcohol would have prolonged the effects of cocaine in her system. 'If the toxicity report came back negative, or there was no evidence of drug use then it would be more likely to be a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.' Despite the post-mortem result, the coroner recorded an open verdict saying death was 'unascertained' and could have been caused by Miss Hargreaves having an epileptic fit in her sleep. Miss Hargreaves' family declined to comment at the inquest. In a statement at the time of her death they: 'Penny was taken from us due to epilepsy. She has left this life and gone to the next but has left a million raindrops of love that touched us all. 'She touched the hearts of everyone that met her. She was full of consideration and compassion and had a love of life.'
