(Photo: Provided by city of Carmel) 298 CONNECT 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCarmel plans to meet with residents and business owners in coming weeks to update them on its plans to convert much of 96th Street into a roundabout corridor during the next two years, the city announced today in a news release. \nThe city will convert the intersections with Hazel Dell Parkway, Gray Road, Delegates Row and Priority Way into roundabouts. The intersection with Keystone Parkway will be converted into a roundabout-style interchange, with Keystone crossing over 96th Street. The city estimates 85,000 cars travel on 96th Street and Keystone daily, according to the news release. \nIn 2016, the City Council approved $257 million in bonds for infrastructure work, including 96th Street. The city estimates the corridor will cost $43 million to upgrade, including $30.6 million from the bonds, $10.4 million in federal funds and $2 million from Hamilton County, according to the news release. \nWork is scheduled to begin this summer on the roundabouts at Delegates Row and Gray and in September on Priority Way and Hazel Dell. All that work will be completed by year's end, the news release said. \nPreliminary construction will begin on the Keystone roundabout interchange this year, but the bulk of the work is scheduled for 2018. \nA multi-use path also will be built along the north side of 96th Street. \nâ€œWe are being proactive in getting the word out about this exciting project that will better serve motorists traveling to and from Fishers and Indianapolis,\" Mayor Jim Brainard said in a prepared statement. \"Similar to the efforts made when we upgraded Keystone Parkway several years ago, we have focused our efforts on making sure our local business owners are prepared for the upcoming construction.\" \nCall IndyStar reporter Chris Sikich at (317) 444-6036.
