(Cook is a former Pitchfork intern.) Two years later, they met at the art space 285 Kent, and later collaborated on the Blood Orange song “ Neptune ” and three songs on Freetown Sound . Cook, a bit of an indie insider, has toured with Hynes in the past, as well as Solange and Chairlift; VeilHymn , his new project with Hynes, marries his interest in P-funk and sepia-toned soul with Hynes’ masterful ability for heartfelt, subtle political songwriting. \nHynes helms the production for their first song, “Hymn,” and much like Freetown Sound , it shows his penchant for genre collage: his guitar riffs have a hint of Hendrix’s off-the-cuff showmanship, and his bass licks and light keys nod to a continued obsession with ‘80s pop. Cook’s reedy falsetto is perfectly sentimental and filled with quiet verve. “It's in your mind/And who knows if that's the thing that's right/All you know is what you think is inside,” he and Hynes both sing. In a recent interview , Hynes said that his songwriting and artistic interests were more invested in understanding his own insecurities in relation to the world. In “Hymn,” the central concerns are mental health and self care—and for Cook and Hynes, they find honesty in talking about those things together.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:45:54.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
