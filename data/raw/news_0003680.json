The shipment should leave Wednesday evening and arrive in China in the next 15 days. SCOTT HAMMOND/FAIRFAX NZ \nA holstein friesian, the type of dairy cow being shipped to China. \n\"The health and welfare of the animals is the number one priority for MPI. No AWEC would be granted unless MPI was confident that all animal welfare requirements had been met,\" MPI's director animal and animal products, Paul Dansted, said. \nREAD MORE: 5000 NZ dairy cows heading to China on Saudi businessman's ship \n\"Once the vessel arrived in New Zealand, MPI veterinarians undertook a detailed assessment of the ship to ensure there was adequate feed, ventilation and water on-board as well as safe and clean holding pens for the animals. \n\"An MPI veterinarian inspects all animals at the port to ensure they are fit to travel. In addition Chinese veterinarians have overseen the animals to ensure they meet Chinese requirements. \n\"During the voyage, the exporter must meet requirements around water, food, space, facilities and having suitably experienced stockmen and/or veterinarians. \n\"They must also have medicines and equipment for treating animals in case any become unwell during the journey. If unusual levels of mortality or sickness occur during the voyage, the ship's master has to report immediately to MPI,\" Dansted said. \nThe cattle are being accompanied by three experienced stockmen, and will be inspected at least four times a day, to ensure their welfare. \nThe shipment is being managed by Australian company Landmark. In a statement, export manager Stephen Reynolds said the shipment was a consignment of high quality holstein breeding heifers for an unnamed but large and well established dairy operation in China. \nHe said three \"very experienced stockmen\" would accompany the animals. \n\"The vessel is a recently converted livestock carrier built specifically for the Australian and New Zealand markets meeting the highest possible world standards as set by the Australian and New Zealand Maritime authorities for the carriage of live animals. \n\"Under the strict NZ government standards for the export of breeding livestock the vessel is capable of transporting in excess of 16,000 head of animals of the same weight category. This clearly allows the Landmark consignment to utilise additional space requirements as required to ensure the highest possible animal welfare outcome and comfort,\" Reynolds said. \nIt had earlier been reported Landmark had applied to export 5300 cows, but an MPI spokesman said because MPI received applications in advance, the number of livestock on the application might change for a number of reasons. \nHe said for a consignment of this size the cows would typically come from several hundred farms. \nMeanwhile Federated Farmers dairy group chairman Andrew Hoggard said he took issue with people who claimed New Zealand was losing out by sending its genetics to competitors like China. \nNZ First leader Winston Peters described it as \"economic treason\" and \"short term thinking\". \nBut Hoggard said the cows were bred for New Zealand conditions and would not necessarily do well in an indoors operation. \n\"It's being confused with the selling of apples and kiwifruit. These aren't cows that make a different kind of milk to anywhere else in the world and that give us a competitive advantage. \n\"Our different breeding point is that we are breeding for cows that will do well on pasture, they are efficient producers based on that, but these going to China won't perform as well under the Chinese traditional barn system,\" Hoggard said. \nHe also argued the Chinese were not getting the top performing cows. \n\"Generally if you need 100-odd calves yourself and you've bred 130, you'd keep the top 100 for yourself and the bottom 30 are the ones you'd ship to China.\" \nNew Zealand farmers received a \"slight premium\" to cows being sold on to the domestic market. \nHoggard also questioned how long the cows would survive because of the greater number of diseases in China, such as foot and mouth. However, in recent years the skill level of animal husbandry had improved. \nHe said it could be argued that the current practice of sending Kiwi cross genetics to Ireland was making the Irish more competitive against New Zealand in China, where the two countries compete for market share. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:51:24.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
