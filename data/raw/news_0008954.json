Most Popular By Alyssa Bailey Feb 5, 2017 The halftime show is still 30 minutes away, but Lady Gaga has given what seems to be a final answer on whether her \"Telephone\" duet partner Beyoncé will be making a surprise appearance on stage with her. A photo posted by xoxo, Joanne (@ladygaga) on Feb 5, 2017 at 2:32pm PST Advertisement - Continue Reading Below She will not nor will anyone else, Gaga wrote on her Instagram. \"There will not be any guest performers tonight, I'm doing these 13 minutes solo! I dedicate every second to the love, diversity, compassion, and wild spirit of our fan base.\" Beyoncé fan accounts confirmed Bey's absence too: Good morning! Just in case the devil is still lying, Beyoncé will NOT be joining @ladygaga during tonight's Super Bowl Halftime Show. ☎️❌ \n— THE BEYHIVÉ (@TheBeyHiveTeam) February 5, 2017 Most Popular Lady Gaga started the rumor earlier this week that Bey would join her when Gaga posted a 'gram of herself preparing in Houston, Bey's hometown, with a bee emoji in her caption.

She said Bey is \"very inspiring, and gives great advice,\" and told reporters she had sent flowers to the singer upon hearing the internet-breaking news of her second pregnancy . Last year, Bey crashed Coldplay's halftime performance last year and announced her Formation world tour . So while nothing is certain and final until this year's performance actually happens, it doesn't seem likely a Beyoncé duet is in the cards.
