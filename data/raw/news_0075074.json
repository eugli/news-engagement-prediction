The Manchester United stadium was blanketed in snow after the North West had been hit by freezing temperatures on Monday night. Even the stadium grow lighting, which is used to help the playing surface regenerate between matches, couldn't thaw the white stuff as the pitch turned from green to white overnight. Old Trafford looked like a scene from a Christmas card on Tuesday morning after heavy snow The Old Trafford cricket ground went the same way, with snow covering the outfield CURRENT WEATHER IN MANCHESTER Manchester temperatures plummeted on Tuesday morning as they hit 0째C... Monday 8pm: 2째C Tuesday 8am: 0째C Tuesday 2pm: 7째C (forecasted) Seven hundred metres down the road at the Old Trafford cricket ground, home of Lancashire County Cricket Club, there was a similar scene as the oval surface was buried under the snow. The county season is due to start in just 37 days, but there will be no prospect of play so long as this weather keeps up. And the weather also claimed its first footballing victim, as Macclesfield's FA Trophy replay against Dulwich Hamlet was postponed due to a frozen pitch. The quarter-final tie is yet to be completed after Dulwich staged an impressive comeback from 2-0 down against their National League opponents. The winner will face Tranmere Rovers in the semi-final, just one game away from a Wembley final. It is unlikely that United's next game will suffer the same fate however, with the club having plenty of time to sort their playing surface before their Saturday lunchtime kick-off against Bournemouth. Macclesfield Town confirmed their FA Trophy tie with Dulwich Hamlet has been postponed Unlike the weather, Zlatan Ibrahimovic is red hot and will want to face Bournemouth Saturday RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:57:03.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
