(Louis DeLuca/The Dallas Morning News) By Jon Machota   Jon Machota on Twitter: @jonmachota \nSeveral NFL stars shared their thoughts on Dak Prescott's rookie season while at the Pro Bowl last week. \nSaints quarterback Drew Brees said spending time with young players like Prescott was the reason he took part in the league's all-star event. \n\"He's a cool customer,\" Brees said. \"I think he's got a presence about him that's hard to explain. It's a confidence but also you can tell that he's got leadership abilities. He's got a lot of things going for him.\" \nBrees, Prescott and Washington's Kirk Cousins were the three quarterbacks representing the NFC. \nCousins and the Redskins lost both games to Prescott and the Cowboys this season by a total of nine points. The veteran QB said he came away very impressed by what he saw from the rookie. \n\"He was so consistent,\" Cousins said. \"He rarely had a down week. He had a lot of maturity and just set the bar really high for the rest of us. He did a great job. \nCousins added: \"I don't think [Prescott carries himself like a rookie]. How could you at this point, having started all those games and won so many and played in such big moments and played well. I think the way he carries himself is part of the reason why he was so successful because he's confident and he knows he can do it, and he did.\" \nSan Diego's Philip Rivers, Kansas City's Alex Smith and Cincinnati's Andy Dalton were the three AFC quarterbacks. \nDalton was the only one from that group to face the Cowboys this season, a 28-14 Dallas victory at AT&T Stadium. \n\"Obviously with the expectations, nobody knew what he was going to be,\" Dalton said of Prescott, \"and all of a sudden when Tony [Romo] gets hurt he steps up and plays really well. It didn't seem like it was too big for him right from the start. He came in and did everything they asked him to do and played at a high level.\" \nTampa Bay's Mike Evans was teammates with Prescott and   at the Pro Bowl. The third-year receiver was on the losing end when the Cowboys hosted the Buccaneers in Week 15. \nEvans thinks Prescott and Elliott should split Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. \n\"Dak Prescott had a phenomenal year,\" Evans said. \"Him or Ezekiel Elliott for Rookie of the Year. They should [combine] it because they both had equally an amazing year.\" \nEvans knows a little something about playing well as a rookie. After being drafted seventh overall in 2014, Evans caught 68 passes for 1,051 yards and 12 touchdowns. \nHow difficult is it to make that type of impact in Year 1? \n\"It depends if you go into the right situation,\" Evans said. \"I think they got drafted into the right situation, great O-line, great receivers, you can't ask for better. Me, Odell [Beckham Jr.], a lot of our class was drafted into the right situation. It's all about that. I think there's a lot of guys that can play, but they're in bad situations.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T09:03:22.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
