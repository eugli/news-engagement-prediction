The court had said: \"In the present case the government is not in possession of any evidence that the petitioners are risk to the security of Pakistan and merely on the basis of the UN Resolution their liberty cannot be curtailed.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:59:41.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
