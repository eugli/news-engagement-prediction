And that's no chive. \nYes, GOP partisans objected strenuously and unanimously to Democratic President Barack Obama 's convoluted overhaul of the nation's medical insurance system when it was proposed, wagging their fingerlings at what they described as a government takeover of health care. \nAfter Obama signed the act in 2010, Republicans in the House of Representatives voted dozens of times to repeal all or most of it. This was easy enough to do because such votes were merely impotent expressions of discontent sure to be blocked in the Senate or vetoed by the White House. \nBut accompanying these remonstrations and obstructions were assurances: \nWe have better ideas. We know how to expand necessary coverage to the poor, protect against medical bankruptcies and offer low-cost preventive services without making a hash of the existing system of private insurance provided largely through employers. If only we could root out those dastardly Democrats, we'd show you! \nThe 2016 Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump , promised to repeal Obamacare on \"Day One\" of his administration and replace it with \"something terrific\" that was cheaper and offered the same or better coverage. \nIt was a big part of Trump's pledge to \"Make America au Gratin Again,\" and although he was maddeningly vague on the details, voters, particularly white, blue-collar voters living on a shoestring, believed him. \nThey elected Trump and GOP majorities in the House and Senate in November. But with those victories for Republicans came full ownership of national health insurance policy. \nTrump did not, of course, move to repeal Obamacare on Day One. Or Day 10. Or Day 30. Bills to repeal, replace or even rehab the health care system have yet to advance in Congress. And I'm certainly not the only common tater to be skeptical that the emergence of a new plan is imminent, as Trump recently promised. \n\"Good gravy!\" I imagine Republicans saying to themselves, their brows crinkled. \"Key provisions of this law are far more popular than we knew. Getting rid of just the unpopular parts either fries the whole thing immediately or creams the insurance companies. Our plans for making good on Trump's pledge to provide 'insurance for everybody' turn out to be half-baked, and voters will scallop us if we simply pass a repeal that would end coverage for up to 30 million people, including many tots.\" \nI'll tell you what's uncomfortably hot: the seats in which GOP lawmakers now sit, wondering how they're going to choke down the starchy mound on the table in front of them. \nAs an aside, I'd recommend the butter of a single-payer, Medicare-for-all system of universal coverage, or the salt of government-sponsored options on the insurance exchanges. \nAm I done, at last, with the potato jokes? \nEye yam.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:01:42.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
