Rakiya, 84, told NAN that her brother [Buhari] needs the prayers of every Nigerian for him to succeed in the task of addressing the problems facing the nation. She said as a human being, President Buhari is bound to fall ill or even die “at any time his Creator wishes’’ . \nHajiya Rakiya, President Buhari's sister Rakiya said since January when President Buhari departed Nigeria for London, she has been speaking with the president every day, and that he is in high spirit. “I just returned from the lesser Hajj, and even while in Saudi Arabia, I was communicating with him every day,” Rakiya popularly called Amadodo said. She said in Saudi Arabia, she communicated with him “every ten hours”. “We were 28 from our mother late Hajiya Zulaihatu who died in 1992, but Buhari was her last born,” she said. President Buhari extended his 10-day vacation in London, United Kingdom in order to complete and receive the results of a series of tests recommended by his doctors. search Image President Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Mr Samson Ayokunle (L) and Gov.
