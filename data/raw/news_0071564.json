Alongside a picture from the shoot, in which the pop star can be seen holding her hands underneath her stomach, Cole wrote, “I am proud to announce that I am one of fifteen ambassadors working with @PrincesTrust & LOreal Paris UK to help thousands of young people turn self-doubt into self-worth. The “All Worth It” Confidence training program starts now! #ALLWORTHIT #PRINCESTRUSTLOREAL.” \nAs Gossip Cop reported, Cole was spotted in November sporting what appeared to be a growing baby bump. The couple, however, who first met on the set of “The X Factor UK” in 2008, had refused to comment on Cole’s pregnancy, despite her being pictured with a bump on numerous occasions. { \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"artist\", \"id\" : 687496, \"name\" : \"One Direction\" } } \nThe surprise announcement comes only hours after Payne made a surprise appearance at the 2017 Brit Awards to accept the Best British Video of The Year Award on One Direction ’s behalf. The former “X Factor” judge and singer started dating a year ago, and from Cole’s Instagram post, the new arrival isn’t too far away. Gossip Cop congratulates the couple on starting a family together!
