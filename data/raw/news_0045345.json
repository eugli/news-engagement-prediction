The 37-year-old, touted to be the world's heaviest woman at 500 kilos, had been binge-watching Khan's films, including 'Sultan' (2016), 'Kick' (2014) and 'Dabangg' (2010), at Mumbai's Saifee Hospital, where she is currently admitted to undergo a lifesaving operation.\n\nArbaaz Khan \nSallu's brother, Arbaaz, tells hitlist, \"I wasn't aware that she [Eman] was a fan of Salman till I read about it in your paper. He has innumerable fans, and while he cannot meet all of them, I'm sure he'll make an exception for her. His team will work it out based on his schedule and availability.\"\n\nEman Ahmed Abdulati \nArbaaz's statement comes after father Salim told mid-day that the actor would meet Eman as soon an official request from the hospital was received. The actor-producer says his family has been reading about Eman's health on a regular basis. \"Muffi (Dr Muffazal Lakdawala, Eman's bariatric surgeon) believes it will take a couple of months before the surgery can be done, is what we hear,\" he signs off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:42:46.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
