No Bazinga! This is BIG. Bill Bradley Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post CBS Photo Archive via Getty Images This is Big. \nCBS is close to finalizing a new agreement with the stars of “ The Big Bang Theory .” (And Sheldon’s really going to like this one.) It brings the show back for two more seasons. \nDeadline reports that the original five cast members, Jim Parsons , Johnny Galecki , Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar, are finalizing two-year deals. As long as negotiations are smooth between CBS and Warner Bros. TV, the show will be coming back for its 11th and 12th seasons. \nThe five original stars will reportedly now have equal pay, earning around $1 million per episode. Previously, Parsons, Galecki and Cuoco had negotiated for equal pay together, and the new deal puts Helberg and Nayyar on that same level. Co-stars Melissa Rauch and Mayim Bialik, whose contracts are also up, will reportedly be in line for major pay raises, as well. \nAs Deadline notes, the contract negotiations are going at the speed of light compared to the dreaded negotiations in 2014, which even delayed production on Season 8. \nRelax, everyone. It’s all good now. Perhaps that shouldn’t be a surprise. \nAlthough there were some worries that Season 10 would be the show’s last, the “Big Bang Theory” stars have shot that down repeatedly. \nGalecki previously told The Huffington Post, “I know that everybody here on the stage really wants it to happen, so I’m confident that we’ll work it out.” \nAnd Parsons told “Today” he’d be “shocked” if the show wasn’t back for more.
