According to police reports, Drake’s bus was caught up in the traffic that was caused by police blocking off roads surrounding the bridge. “One officer was approached by a male from a tour van caught up in the traffic congestion, claiming to be part of Drake’s entourage,” said Inspector Phil Spurgeon. “He offered for Drake to speak to the male on the bridge, if that would help. The offer was declined with thanks.” Although Drake’s help wasn’t accepted, the story has a happy ending— Manchester Evening News reports that the man was eventually safely escorted off the bridge, and taken to hospital for treatment. Drake is currently in Europe for the Boy Meets World Tour .
