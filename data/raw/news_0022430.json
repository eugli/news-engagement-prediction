Key points: The UN officials based their estimate off accounts given by refugees Myanmar says around 100 people have been killed in the crackdown Aung San Suu Kyi's office labelled allegations of sexual violence 'fake rape' \nTwo unnamed United Nations officials spoke to the Reuters news agency in Bangladesh, where around 70,000 Rohingyas have fled. \n\"The talk until now has been of hundreds of deaths … this is probably an underestimation — we could be looking at thousands,\" said one of the officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity. A report says that the systematic violation of human rights against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar's Rakhine falls within a defined framework of genocide. \nThe officials were interviewed separately and based their estimates on testimony from refugees arriving in Bangladesh over the last four months. \nThe Myanmar Government has said about 100 people have been killed in the subsequent crackdown , but independent verification is impossible since the army has sealed off parts of western borderlands. \nThe Rohingyas have lived in Myanmar for generations but are not granted citizenship by the Buddhist-majority Government, and live with apartheid-like restrictions and abject poverty in Rakhine State.
