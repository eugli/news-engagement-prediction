In Trumpland, there is no quicker way to capture__Donald Trump’s__ attention than through television appearances—just ask Sean Spicer . But unlike the embattled White House press secretary, whose performance to date has reportedly disappointed Trump, Stephen Miller apparently impressed the reality-TV star president while making the rounds on the Sunday morning shows. Shortly after the fledgling White House policy advisor vociferously defended the nascent administration’s controversial travel ban, advanced false claims that widespread voter fraud cost Trump the popular vote, dodged questions about Mike Flynn’s standing in the West Wing and backed Kellyanne Conway’s unscrupulous “free commercial” for Ivanka Trump’s eponymous fashion line, Trump espoused praise for Miller’s combative performance. “Congratulations Stephen Miller- on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job!” the president wrote on Twitter. As widespread confusion beset airports, and protests erupted across the country, Miller quickly emerged as the public face of the ban. The Monday after the order was issued, Joe Scarborough lambasted the 31-year-old adviser. “This weekend was a disgrace, and it’s all on your shoulders,” the Morning Joe host said of Miller. But in the West Wing, Miller’s status remained intact. In an e-mail to The New York Times , Stephen Bannon —widely seen as the mastermind behind Trumpism—praised his populist counterpart as “a loyal and faithful soldier in the Trump movement, a warrior for the working class.” His performance on Sunday seemed to simply cement his standing. It is unsurprising that Trump applauded Miller’s Sunday appearances. For an administration that has cast the media—notably the cable news media—as “the opposition party”, the young adviser showed up for battle. On Fox News, Miller asserted that the travel ban was a “lawful and necessary action” and that “the president’s powers here are beyond question.” And in separate interviews on CBS and ABC, the adviser derided the United States court system, arguing that it was acting like “a supreme branch of government” and declared “One unelected judge in Seattle cannot make laws for the entire country,” in reference to Judge James Robart , who blocked the executive action last weekend. And in true Trump surrogate form, Miller masterfully ducked questions he did not care to answer. When asked by ABC’s This Week host George Stephanopolous about the revelation that National Security Adviser Mike Flynn discussed the election-related sanctions leveled against Moscow with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before the inauguration—despite the Trump team’s assertions that he did not—Miller responded, “I don’t have any news to make you today on this point.” Similarly, to Chuck Todd on NBC’s Meet the Press , Miller said the White House “did not give me anything to say” about Flynn. But in Trump’s view, the pièce de résistance of Miller's performance was likely when he sparred with Stephanopoulos over Trump’s well-worn—and unsubstantiated—defense that he would have beaten Hillary Clinton in the popular vote were it not for the “millions” of people who voted illegally in the election. When asked to comment on the claim President Trump made last week that he would have won New Hampshire if “thousands” of people had not been bussed in to cast ballots in the state, Miller insisted that it is “widely known” that this is the case and that it is a “very real” and “very serious” issue. When Stephanopoulos pressed that the Trump administration had provided “absolutely no evidence” of voter fraud, Miller angrily said, “There are massive numbers of non-citizens in this country who are registered to vote. That is a scandal. We should stop the presses and as a country we should be aghast,” which prompted the ABC host to once again push back and reiterate that the White House had presented “zero evidence” to support Trump’s claim. This is nothing new for Miller, whose rise to prominence in the West Wing has been swift. As a former top aide to Trump’s freshly confirmed attorney general Jeff Sessions during his time in the Senate, Miller developed a reputation on Capitol Hill as a hardliner on immigration and advocate of the nationalistic policies that defined Trump’s bid for the presidency. “Stephen was the kind of guy who would make a passionate ideological argument to a roomful of people who were there to make pragmatic decisions,” Alex Conant , a former aide to Senator Marco Rubio , said in an interview with the Times . Along with Bannon, Miller is seen as the architect of Trumpism, and as my colleague T.A. Frank notes , is creating the framework to turn the belief system pervasive among Trump’s senior staffers that “America is a home, not an economy, and the economy must serve the home, not the other way around” into actual policy. “Steve is a true believer in every sense of the word, not just in this message of economic populism but in President Trump as a leader,” Jason Miller , who worked on the Trump campaign, told the Times . “Steve’s fiercely loyal and has a better understanding of the president’s vision than almost anyone.” Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:37:15.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
