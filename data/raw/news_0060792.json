At one moment, the crowd even refused to return the ball after Mitchell Marsh hit Jayant Yadav for a huge six. \nFor many, the very act has been regarded as a way of Indian fans taking over from their players even as the match enters its 'decisive' phase. \nIt happened in the 39th over of the Aussie second innings. \nMarsh read the flight of the ball well, and lofted the ball high and mighty and it landed in one of the more crowded part of the stadium. \nBut good sense prevailed and the ball was returned to the field after having enjoyed much carousing in the stands. \nWATCH the video here: \nAt Stumps on Day 2, Aussie skipper Steve Smith (59 off 117) and Marsh (21 off 48) were unbeaten.
