One busy barley crop \nOn a hot day in early January, a crew of 40 people descended on the property, including drone operators, firefighters and the Cameron Lock team, including student Luke Fritsch and surveyor Adam Nicholson \nOn his first day, Mr Nicholson got his first taste of the scale of the epic job ahead. \n\"Daunting would probably be an understatement.\" \n\"You see a 750 metre by 350 metre barley crop and they want to fill it with all those letters and symbols?\" Photo: 'Once in a lifetime project': Surveyor Adam Nicholson on the job in the crop. (Supplied: Adam Nicholson ) \nArmed with little cans of pink paint and a GPS unit, Mr Nicholson walked around and sprayed a patch of paint every two metres to accurately map out the lines and curves of the giant logo. \nTractors, small flat drum rollers and even brush cutters were brought in to flatten the crop using the pink guide markers. \nBut the production company eventually employed a technique that became famous for leading the public to believe that aliens existed. \nA simple flat board, which was discovered to be used in several crop circle hoaxes worldwide, did the trick on the most finicky parts. \nThe Japanese symbols were the 'trickiest part of the job', Mr Nicholson said, with each one taking around half a day to get exactly right. \nCompounding the difficulty was the fact the logo had to be done in a continuous straight line, to avoid multiple lines wandering in and out of the crop. \nThis stipulation led to amusing scenes when the surveyors ran out of paint or wanted lunch and had to trace their way back through four or five letters to get out to avoid crushing the crop. \n\"You felt like you were in a maze,\" Mr Nicholson said. \"Lucky we didn't make any mistakes.\" Company chuffed with results \nTo ensure the beer company itself could be in charge of the grand reveal, the project shoot was kept tightly under wraps, but that didn't stop a few curious cockies stopping by wondering why all this fuss was happening in a barley crop. \nForty-eight cans of pink paint and a week of dawn to dusk work later, the surveying job was done. \nEarly one morning, drones filmed the freshly landscaped paddock and the crop was then harvested, erasing all signs of Hatherleigh's short brush with advertising fame. External Link: The making of the beer advertisement \nIn post production, Japanese rugby superstar Ayumu Goromaru was added to the shots and also introduces a separate two-minute video of the making of the commercial, released earlier this month on YouTube . \nFor a project that required so much time and effort, the Mount Gambier surveying team said the finished advertisement was impressive, if a bit short. \n\"All that for a 15-second ad,\" said Mr Nicholson, laughing. \"But it looks fantastic.\" \n\"It looks better than any of us could have expected when we first went into it,\" Mr Cameron said. \n\"Importantly, the client was delighted with the final result,\" said Jeremy Brown from Dynamite Productions. \n\"The guys in Japan were chuffed,\" he said. \n\"We could have gone anywhere in Australia for it, but we went to Hatherleigh.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:22:05.920+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
