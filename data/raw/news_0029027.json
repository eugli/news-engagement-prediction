The NRDC argued that the Administrative Procedure Act required wildlife officials to give public notice and an opportunity to hear comments before delaying actions to protect the bee. \n“[W]ithout valid explanation, opportunity for public input, or other legally required process,” the Fish and Wildlife Service is “denying the bee the essential protections of the law,” the complaint said. \nIn declaring the bee endangered last month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service explained the species’ ecological importance. \n“As pollinators, rusty patched bumble bees contribute to our food security and the healthy functioning of our ecosystems,” the group’s website said . “Bumble bees are keystone species in most ecosystems, necessary not only for native wildflower reproduction, but also for creating seeds and fruits that feed wildlife as diverse as songbirds and grizzly bears.” \nCrops like blueberries, cranberries and tomatoes thrive from the activity of pollinators like the rusty patched bumble bee. \nThe insect has historically been found in 28 states in the East and upper Midwest, as well as parts of Canada. Its numbers have plummeted due to the loss of grasslands and prairies, increased exposure to pesticides and climate change, according to FWS. \n“In recent years, however, the species has undergone a dramatic contraction, disappearing from approximately ninety percent of its historical range,” the lawsuit said. \nThe Huffington Post could not immediately reach officials from the Fish and Wildlife Service and Department of the Interior for comment.
