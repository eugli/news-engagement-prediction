They also failed to coax head of local recruitment Trevor Todd across Manchester While they would not comment publicly, City are understood to be privately confident that they have managed to retain key members of staff and are untroubled by the defections. United, under the command of executive vice chairman Ed Woodward, brought in sports headhunters Nolan Partners as they looked to revamp operations at the club. They have since brought in around 50 new scouts, including the man who found Raheem Sterling, to ensure they are first to emerging talent. Had they been able to bring highly-regarded Todd across town it would have represented a significant coup in the arms race that has broken out for the area’s best youth talent. Todd has been viewed as influential in City’s recent march to Mancunian supremacy at youth level, a development that has not gone unnoticed at Old Trafford. United have signed the man who discovered Raheem Sterling (left) as they bid for supremacy United also trained their sights on Newman in what would have been another substantial blow for the red half of Manchester. Had Newman left City, it would also have created the intriguing prospect of United going after Pep Guardiola’s targets in the coming windows and offered the intriguing prospect of a summer transfer war. However, former Bristol City and Norwich City defender Newman, is going nowhere. The 53–year-old arrived at City in 2008, the same year as the Abu Dhabi takeover, and was instrumental in the signing of David Silva from Valencia in 2010. City have reacted to the cross-city onslaught by tying down valued members of staff to new contracts in a bid to stave off not just United but other Premier League rivals. The departure of Newman could have seen United attempt to sign Pep Guardiola's targets United are thought to have offered more money to their targets and believe that, along with the fact they will not have to relocate, is a strong incentive. The moves have not come as a shock to those within the corridors of power at the Etihad, who see it as vindication of their project. United’s hiring spree also focused on off the field activity. Manager Jose Mourinho was furious at transport and accommodation arrangements during the club’s ill-fated summer tour of China, a view shared by captain Wayne Rooney. Bearing that in mind, it may come as little surprise that a new head of operations was on United’s shopping list with City’s Dan Schofield, who has been with the club for two-and-a-half years, to make the switch. Jose Mourinho was furious at transport and accommodation during the club's tour of China Schofield, who specialises in planning events, has previously worked on the Tour de France and London 2012. He has been joined across the city by fellow departures academy scouts Dave Harrison and Lyndon Tomlinson. United believe Harrison and Tomlinson’s capture is something of a coup, given their roles in a relentless City drive that has seen them snap up most of the area’s best young talent. However, while they go with their current employer’s best wishes, City are understood to be relaxed about their departures and are confident that suitable replacements can be found.
