The institute offers classes in General English, IELTS Preparation, Business English, Speaking with Confidence and summer programmes.\nThe new institute will officially be launched on Saturday, with an open day for the public and an opening ceremony.\nThe open day will offer a range of activities including taster lessons for adults, kids and teens, a parent workshop on how the council teaches English, an IELTS presentation and an opportunity to take a free level test. There will also be storytelling throughout the day and visitors will also have the chance to win free English courses.\nIngram said the reason she feels British Council has been successful in their teaching operation with young people is because parents recognise the institution as a teaching expert.\n“We’ve been teaching English for more than 75 years, almost 40 years in the UAE, and with only the best qualified and most experienced teachers, they know we can build their child’s confidence,” said Ingram.\nIn the year ahead, the British Council is also organising a number of programmes as part the ‘UAE-UK 2017 Year of Creative Collaboration’. Some highlights from the 2017 programme include the UAE and UK Short Film Festival, the BBC Proms Dubai with BBC Symphony Orchestra and Craft Makers at Design Days Dubai.\nThe special collaboration between the UAE and the UK is to commemorate the long historical and cultural ties of friendship dating back centuries between the two countries.\nHighlights of British Council open day\nLocation: British Council at Al Bateen, Abu Dhabi\nDate and Time: Saturday February 4, 9am to 4pm, Opening ceremony from 4pm to 6pm\n9am–10am: Taster Lessons for Kids (who are new to English)\n12 noon-1pm: Introduction to IELTS Workshop\n2pm-3pm: Parents’ Workshop\n3pm-4pm: Taster Lessons for Adults (with two years of English)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:50:27.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
