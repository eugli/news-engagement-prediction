Bush speaks out on Trump's Russia scandal, travel ban Jon Stewart, the former host of the “Daily Show,” crawled out from under Stephen Colbert’s desk to deliver a message to the American media in the era of Donald Trump. Openly admitting that he clearly “misses it,” Colbert warmly welcomed Stewart back on-air for his second appearance since Donald Trump became president. Colbert opened the segment with Stewart asking about the recent exclusion of CNN, Politico and the New York Times from a White House press briefing, “So Jon, what do you think about Trump banning the mainstream media from that briefing?” Stewart responded, “I can’t believe the guy’s got the balls to get away with that,” Stewart said. “Trump lies more in one press conference than CNN does in a year, and that’s coming from a guy who, as you know, hates CNN.” Colbert and Stewart stayed on the topic of Trump’s war with the media, discussing Trump’s recent press conference in which he snapped at an Orthodox Jewish reporter who asked him about anti-Semitism. Trump insisted during that press conference that he is the least anti-Semitic and least racist person you will ever meet. skip - Jon Stewart To The Media: It's Time To Get Your Groove Back Jon Stewart To The Media: It's Time To Get Your Groove Back CBS “I don’t think that’s true!” Stewart declared. “He said that to a guy wearing a yarmulke. Donald, you’re not even the least anti-Semitic person in that clip we showed.” Stewart offered evidence for how he knows Trump is lying, “Because he constantly says the phrase ‘believe me.’ Nobody says ‘believe me’ unless they're lying.” Before signing off, Stewart offered some final thoughts and tried to give a quick pep-talk to the media. “Here’s my point, media. Here’s my point. This breakup with Donald Trump has given you, the media, an amazing opportunity for self-reflection and improvement. Instead of worrying about whether Trump is un-American; or if he thinks you’re the enemy; or if he’s being mean to you; or if he’s going to let you go back into the briefings; do something for yourself. Self-improvement! Take up a hobby. I recommend journalism.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T12:28:21.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
