It's a key priority of Gov. Greg Abbott, who has been in a standoff with Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez over her decision not to detain all unauthorized immigrants in her jail for federal authorities. \nAbbott and other supporters of the ban worry that if police allow criminal immigrants to go free they may commit future crimes. \n\"What's at stake here is the rule of law,\" said Sen. Charles Perry, R-Lubbock, the bill's author. \"What's at stake is inconsistently applying laws across this country as well as this state.\" \nThe governor hailed the Senate vote as a step toward keeping \"dangerous criminals off of our streets.\" \n\"As Governor, I will not tolerate sanctuary city policies that put the citizens of Texas at risk,\" Abbott said in a written statement. \"Elected officials do not get to pick and choose which laws they will obey.\" \nOpponents, including many law enforcement leaders and business interests, are concerned the measure will hurt the economy and amplify fear in immigrants — both those in the country legally and illegally — hurting relations with local police and making communities less safe. Critics also fear the measure will promote racial profiling among officers who want to avoid being accused of failing to enforce federal immigration laws. \n\"When people go from a broken taillight to a broken family to broken trust in the system, that is real,\" said Sen. Sylvia Garcia, D-Houston. \nPolice chiefs in some of Texas' largest cities, including Houston, San Antonio and Austin, have opposed the legislation. And on Tuesday, the Dallas County Commissioners Court passed a resolution declaring the county a welcoming community for immigrants, including unauthorized ones, essentially thumbing their noses at anti-sanctuary efforts. Dallas County passes resolution welcoming unauthorized immigrants \nThe resolution called on local law enforcement agencies to \"end nonessential collaborations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\" \nThe vote in the Republican-dominated Senate, though, was practically preordained. The chamber approved a similar measure in 2015, though it failed to pass in the House. Following about six hours of debate the measure passed the Senate on a party-line preliminary vote, as expected, 20-11. A final Senate vote is expected on Wednesday. \nProspects for the bill's passage in the House this year are improved compared to two years ago. The Senate's early action, and the push from the governor, could provide momentum. But opponents, including some business interests, will target their efforts to at least rein in the measure in the lower chamber. \nUnder the bill, local governments would lose state grant funding and face steep fines if they adopt policies that prevent local officers from enforcing immigration laws. They would also be punished for failing to honor all detainer requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Detainers are nonbinding requests to keep suspected unauthorized immigrants in jail after their release date so that federal officials can ascertain whether the person should be deported. \nThe bill would apply major fines to agencies that adopt sanctuary policies. An initial violation would bring a fine of up to $1,500. For each continuing day the offending policy is in place, the agency could be fined up to $25,500 per day. Law enforcement agencies could also face civil suits from crime victims if they are hurt by an individual who was released by police despite the existence of an immigration detainer. \nUpping the ante for police leaders who adopt sanctuary policies, the bill would also make sheriffs and police chiefs subject to a Class A misdemeanor for doing so. That could mean a fine of up to $4,000 and a year in jail if the district attorney presses charges. \nIf it becomes law, cities and counties that adopt sanctuary policies could face a double-whammy from Texas and the Trump administration. The president signed an executive order that would also rescind federal grants to sanctuary jurisdictions. \nInitially, Perry's bill only punished local governments by taking grant funds from sanctuary jurisdictions. Republican supporters of the measure had been looking for more harsh sanctions on offending jurisdictions, because state doesn't give counties much money . \nAbbott cut nearly $2 million in funding to Travis County as punishment for Hernandez's sanctuary policy, though none of those slashed funds affected her department. But Abbott said cutting grant funds wasn't enough. Abbott: \"We're working on legislation that will pose real penalties - fines, potential jail time, for sheriffs who do not follow the law.\" pic.twitter.com/qT2wux3wmy — Fox News (@FoxNews) February 4, 2017 \nThe governor wants legislation that would impose fines and criminal charges against public officers who promote sanctuary policies, and he even threatened to kick them out of office. Today I cut funding to Travis County because of its Sanctuary City policy. Stiffer penalties coming soon. #txlege https://t.co/mQZ9Suf62e — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) February 1, 2017 \nAmong other concerns, the bill's opponents said it could force sheriffs to hold inmates in jail longer than they are legally allowed. \nDemocratic lawmakers attempted to tamp down the bill and ease worries for immigrant communities and local police. Among the changes proposed were measures that would provide additional protections for unauthorized immigrants who are crime victims, require immigration law training for officers and ensure that people aren't arrested solely because of their immigration status. Predictably, most of those were rejected on a party-line vote. \nIn a four-page letter to senators, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said the measure was legally sound. \n\"In short, none of the legal concerns this letter addresses indicate that [the bill] is legally invalid,\" Paxton wrote. He added that the measure would \"make great strides to keep communities secure by requiring state and local law enforcement to cooperate with federal agencies.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:43:03.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
