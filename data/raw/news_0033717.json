In fact, they are more full of beans than they have ever been,” she said, referring to the camp’s monotonous diet. \n“They do eat a lot of beans. But I imagine the celebrity who leaves tonight will be giving their beans the flick the moment they’re out of camp?” asked Brown. Chris and Julia, we know what you’re doing and you need to see us after class. Picture: Supplied/Nigel Wright for Ten. Source: Supplied \n“Mmm, that’s TOTALLY what I would do, doctor, ”said Morris, who at first seamlessly segued back into hosting, before admitting she was on “the verge of giggling.” \nIf that entire exchange went over your head, we may have to give you quick a lesson in crude Australian slang — in the most delicate way (this is a family website, after all). \n‘Flicking the bean’ is a particularly euphemistic way of describing, ahem, female self-pleasuring. With cameras around 24/7, we’d imagine it’s one of many private joys denied to the celebs during their time in the jungle. \nThe pair’s naughty little quip didn’t go entirely unnoticed: Did @drchrisbrown just joke about flicking the bean on #ImACelebrityAU or do I have heat stroke?
