'We don't know if the stress they suffer is harmful, but parents can mitigate it by spending time with their children during afternoons and weekends. 'They should make meals together, sit together and read books, so the child gets the contact they have missed while in childcare.' The children studied had all been in day care for five to six months and their saliva was measured for cortisol in the morning and mid-afternoon. Children who spend more than eight hours in childcare are the most stressed, scientists say The stress hormone is a marker of emotional reactions and rises when demands on a child exceed their ability to cope. Readings were 32 per cent higher in children who attended day care than those at home. Cortisol normally follows the same rhythm, reaching its highest level about 30 minutes after waking, then falling during the day and evening. But Professor Drugli said: 'We saw that stress levels rose during the day in childcare, while they fell at home where the environment remained stable. DIET MAKES CHILDREN PERFORM BETTER Parents do all kinds of things to help their children get top marks in school. But before you splash out on a tutor, consider this: research shows a child's diet can dramatically affect their IQ. Children who eat fruit, vegetables, fish, and whole grains in their first three years of school do far better in tests than their peers with poor diets, a study in September found. The findings, from the University of Eastern Finland, were independent of children's socio-economic status, physical fitness, and body type. 'After eight hours or more, which is a typical working day for parents who both work, the stress levels were highest.' The findings echo older studies on toddlers, the age group most vulnerable to the stress which evens out as children grow older, learn more and become better at regulating their emotions. Researchers have previously found young children get more stressed in larger cr√®che groups, with others of different ages and in smaller spaces. It is not clear if stress levels caused by childcare are high enough to cause problems, but cortisol can change the way the brain develops. The study, published in the journal Early Child Development and Care, states: 'Temperament in terms of shyness, poor self-control, and negative emotionality seems to be associated with elevated cortisol levels among older children in childcare.' Misunderstandings and difficulties in peer relationships are particularly difficult for toddlers who struggle more socially. But the study concludes: 'Sensitive support from parents may have an important role in re-equilibrating toddlers' emotions after a day in childcare.'
