He went to the airliner’s bathroom to make final preparations for his attack and considered trying to set off the bomb there. But to be certain he was over American soil, he returned to his seat to check the map before pushing the plunger under his clothing to mix the chemicals and ignite the explosives. Perhaps because of excess moisture, the contraption did not explode but let out a flame, seriously burning Mr. Abdulmutallab, who said he tried to get his burning pants off before passengers jumped on him. One crew member threatened to throw him out of the plane, and a passenger hit him once before another crew member intervened, he said. \nAdvertisement   Mr. Abdulmutallab began speaking to officials before leaving the plane, admitting that he had tried to set off a bomb and that he was a member of Al Qaeda. He later stopped talking, but resumed within a few weeks and appears to have become completely cooperative. -He surprised prosecutors at his 2011 trial by suddenly insisting on pleading guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison in 2012.

His F.B.I. interviews amount to a sort of jihadist bildungsroman, telling the story of a shy, serious and earnest son of a prominent Nigerian businessman. He attended University College London, hoping to study engineering and go to work for his father’s construction company, he told the F.B.I. He lived with his brother in an expensive apartment his family owned in the British capital. But he became interested in religion, and it gradually took over his life. In 2005, he discovered the recorded lectures of Mr. Awlaki — who had not yet fully embraced violence — on sale in an Islamic bookstore in London. In 2009, while living in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, he came to feel that “God was guiding him to jihad” and set out to Yemen to try to find the American cleric, by then a rising Qaeda leader. In training, he fired a Kalashnikov rifle a few times but was “never comfortable” shooting. His sober devotion to the jihadist cause, however, persuaded Mr. Awlaki that he could be trusted with a suicide attack. When a friend from Nigeria called to urge Mr. Abdulmutallab to come home, he realized his parents were behind the call. He agonized, as he prepared for the flight to Detroit, about how to tell them goodbye. He told the F.B.I. agents that only Mr. Awlaki or a comparable figure, not his parents, would have “the religious authority” to dissuade him from jihad. His last email from Mr. Awlaki offered encouragement for his lethal mission. “I wish it all goes well, I wish you the best,” the cleric wrote. Photo Mr. Abdulmutallab described in the interviews how Mr. Awlaki encouraged him in his lethal mission. When the agents asked whether, in retrospect, Mr. Awlaki’s documented patronage of prostitutes disturbed him, he demurred. It might be false slander, he said. If not, then Mr. Awlaki “could repent for those sins and his commitment to jihad would outweigh such transgressions,” Mr. Abdulmutallab said. The Abdulmutallab interviews were initially sought from the F.B.I. for a 2015 book about the life and death of the cleric. The Times subsequently sued to obtain the documents, which the F.B.I. said should be secret to protect terrorism investigations. In December, Ronnie Abrams, a federal judge in Manhattan, ordered the bureau to conduct a “line-by-line” review and to hand over whatever could be safely released. The 200 pages made available have the names of Qaeda operatives and other details redacted but give a rare firsthand account of the evolution of a terrorist who survived his suicide mission. \nGet politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter .
