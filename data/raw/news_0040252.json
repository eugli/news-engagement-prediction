RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Trump Takes on 'SNL' Again ] \nLast weekend, Trump was again mocked on the show as an ignorant bully and narcissist. His press secretary Sean Spicer was characterized as a raging, out-of-control fool. His White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was savaged as a publicity-starved insider who is desperate for attention. \nIt's an axiom in Washington that the worst thing that can happen to a politician or a public figure is to be portrayed as a laughingstock. Trump, Spicer and Conway are perilously close to that point for millions of Americans. \nOne of the theatrical highs of the Saturday night show was the opening, in which actress Melissa McCarthy portrayed Spicer as unhinged and unable to contain his anger at reporters attending his briefing. At one point, McCarthy as Spicer explained Trump's plan for \"extreme\" vetting of people entering the United States by using Barbie and Moana dolls. The faux Spicer said of Barbie, \"We know she's OK because she's blonde.\" \nLater in the show, comedian Kate McKinnon played Conway in a sendup of the film \"Fatal Attraction,\" breaking into the home of CNN anchor Jake Tapper, played by Beck Bennett, trying to force him to put her on his show. \n[ RELATED: 'Saturday Night Live' Shapes the Way We Think About Presidential Candidates ] \nAlec Baldwin, impersonating Trump, showed up in \"The People's Court\" to argue for his travel ban that has been blocked by the courts. The \"judge\" said, \"Mr. Trump, you understand that this is a TV court, right?\" Baldwin's Trump replied, \"That's OK. I'm a TV president.\" \nAll this brought \"SNL\" a 7.2 overnight rating in metered market households, its highest overnight rating since 2011, according to NBC. \nAnother important dimension was that a woman played Spicer, which news reports have suggested annoys Trump, and another woman, McKinnon, played Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \nIf the past is any guide, Trump will lash out soon, calling more attention to \"SNL\" and prompting many Americans to watch the mockery as replayed on YouTube and elsewhere. This is part of Trump's problem. He can't help himself. He regularly strikes at critics, often on Twitter in the wee hours, for perceived transgressions large and small. Week after week, propelled by Trump's tweets and the outraged comments of his aides, the image of a temper-tantrum-prone Trump is sinking in. And this can't be good for the new president. Kenneth T.
