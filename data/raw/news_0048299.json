GOK is actually offering to pay doctors way better than those in private hospitals”. \nThe figures could not be verified as the CBA indicates that doctors want the lowest-paid doctor, an intern, paid a salary of between Sh325,000 and Sh342,770 and the highest-paid Sh852,180 to Sh946,000. \nA source within the negotiating team said: “Talks have collapsed because of this (post); (Health principal secretary, Dr Nicholas) Muraguri is busy talking to bloggers.” Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:17:10.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
