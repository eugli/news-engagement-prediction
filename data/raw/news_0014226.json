O’Reilly brought this up by asking Trump if there was any “validity” to critics who say it is “irresponsible” of Trump to make his claims without providing any evidence. \nTrump insisted that “many people” have come out and said he’s correct, though O’Reilly pointed out “you need to have data to back that up.” Trump continued to say that “it’s a really bad situation” where illegal immigrants and dead people have been turning up on voter registrars. \nTrump said he wanted an investigation into voter fraud over a week ago, though there have been reports that the matter is no longer a “top priority” for him now. \nDuring a separate point in the interview , Trump reiterated his “respect” for Vladimir Putin despite O’Reilly’s comment about how the Russian president is a “killer.” \n“We’ve got a lot of killers. What, do you think our country’s so innocent,” Trump responded. \nThe full interview will air on Fox at 4:00 p.m. EST. \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T05:07:20.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
