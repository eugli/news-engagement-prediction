I mean, I was having conversations with people across status hierarchies on Twitter. The fact that I could have a conversation with the president of the university, the lead researcher in my field — I think you and I first crossed paths on Twitter, right? The fact that I’m talking to a major publication about my research — none of that would have been possible without the context, the weak ties, that Twitter helped to magnify. \nNow it’s come to a point where I probably get less from it individually, and I think of it as a platform for the people I’m trying to help. It helps me become useful to my graduate students, for example. I use it to find resources for my students. I use it to try to help my colleagues and myself get our work out. It’s probably now more of a conduit for my institution and my profession. I may not get quite as much from it personally, but the long-term relationships that I built with people there are still really valuable to me. \nA little more than a year ago, even before you discreetly live-tweeted from a Trump rally, you predicted that Donald Trump could win the presidency. You wrote, \"We always have in us the impulse to elect a President Trump, Always.\" \nThat’s right. Always. \nWhat were you thinking then? Was that the sociologist talking? Was that the black feminist talking? \nThat was definitely the black woman in me. There’s a black, Southern woman in me who has a particular understanding of race in this country, but I was informed by the sociologist in me, which is that we know that everything has a historical context. \nI just thought it was really ridiculous of people in discourse [speaking as if] there had been a break in our historical narrative, and there was some new America that did not have the historical baggage of race. And I thought, I missed that development. Of course we can elect Donald Trump. The idea that we could not elect a racist, sexist, xenophobic president would forget that we have elected them before. Why we thought we have made such a huge jump in our culture was just beyond my understanding, and I was really disappointed and a little afraid, frankly. I got so mad at the news media and other people being so resistant to that idea because I think that their resistance to the idea of him being possible, helps make him possible. \nThey didn’t take him seriously enough. Didn’t treat him as a real candidate until it was far too late. And I thought that was a blindness of how white identity works, of how there’s always this march of progression of history and there’s never a look back at our history. \nWe were not \"postracial\" quite yet? \nYes, exactly. Donald Trump is not the anomaly. Barack Obama was the anomaly. Donald Trump actually makes perfect sense in the big, historical narrative arc of this country. \nYou’ve written that a lot of people in mainstream academe and the media didn’t see Donald Trump’s victory coming, but that \"the old black women in Sunday school\" did. What should we be learning from them? \nOh, everything! \nThis was one of those elections where the outsider perspective mattered. In ethnography, for example, we talk about the insider-outsider divide. So when an ethnographer goes into a foreign field to learn about people, one of the most powerful things they have is their lens of being an outsider. I think that’s one of the great things that people of color will always have in this country — that we are, by default, outsiders, and it gives you a certain perspective on our society and our nation. \nBlack people, in particular, because of how being black is defined in our country, are always really intimately aware of how important history is to the present in a way that not all groups are. And that’s actually kind of anti-American. The American ideology is that we are always new. You can always start fresh and build a new self, the Horatio Alger story. Only for African-Americans are we defined so much by our history that we always have a historical perspective, and so because of that we are able to see these weird moments like the election of Donald Trump in a different perspective. \nWe needed to think of this moment as having some precedent, and we needed to pay attention to it. And we needed to temper our enthusiasm about how much we have overcome. Our song is \"We Shall Overcome,\" not \"We Overcame.\" That might be an important perspective. \nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity. \nGoldie Blumenstyk writes about the intersection of business and higher education.
