Reputedly spawned when an English duchess made a simple request for cake and tea before dinner time in the mid-1800's, afternoon tea has since become a more decadent occasion. Plush baked scones, assorted finger sandwiches and desserts with a generous pot of tea is now the modern standard. While London's traditional luxury offerings could easily monopolize this list, we've included quirky, novel options for those seeking teas with a twist, including one set on a vintage double-decker bus and a fanciful version inspired by Alice in Wonderland.
