Lots of free agent busts too. Feb 15, 2017 5:40 PM \nCooley was a good player in his prime but is completely ignorable as an analyst/commentator. jlinatl says: Feb 15, 2017 5:47 PM \nMaybe Cooley is not speculating but presenting it as such because it was leaked to him by someone within the organization who wants McCloughan gone. Feb 15, 2017 5:51 PM \nit’s a fair point silverandblack052099 says: Feb 15, 2017 5:55 PM \nUnless the person who is suffering from addiction makes it publicly known it’s never ok to do so. Shame on you Chris Cooley! oswizard says: Feb 15, 2017 5:57 PM \nJust an irresponsible quip coming from someone who has a lack of experience when it comes to time behind the microphone. Love Cooley, and particularly his film breakdown, but he goes where he should not sometimes when it comes to subject matter. mremeet says: Feb 15, 2017 5:57 PM \nI wonder aloud whether Chris Cooley is drinking turpentine. Feb 15, 2017 6:01 PM \nMaybe its fake news? Probably not true, but its just enough to start a rumor, and make ya go huh? Could happen, people do have track records…. boknowsvt says: Feb 15, 2017 6:27 PM \nCooley should know. He sounds pretty hung over most mornings on his morning shows. breadmeatcheese says: Feb 15, 2017 6:34 PM \nthe miko grimes of washington. stoneydog1000 says: Feb 15, 2017 6:35 PM \nMaybe, the same “someone in Cincinnati” that told Cooley that Marvin Lewis wouldn’t be back in 2017, told him this. breadmeatcheese says: Feb 15, 2017 6:44 PM \nscott mcloughlan’s picture does look like he has a lot of roseacea going on, and his drafts have been eratic lately… \nmaybe he is fubar.
