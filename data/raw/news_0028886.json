Chances are you haven’t really decided your V-day plans or what you want to gift your girlfriend. She hasn’t said it outright, and you’re no mind reader yourself. What do you do then? This is where we come in. Let us break this to you one step at a time. \nShe wants you to surprise her, but not with something materialistic or a grand gesture you saw in a movie. She doesn’t want to be serenaded with guitar music nor does she want you to stand under her balcony with a stereo in your hand, à la John Cusack in ‘Say Anything’. She is a hopeless romantic, a sucker for cheesy things. So, she needs something romantic just for the two of you, exactly to your understanding. \n1) She wants to be that person whom you think for beforehand and not someone whom you go to at the last moment or when you don’t want to be alone. Write her a letter or take care of one of the things for her that’s been long pending, and then say ‘Oh that, that has been taken care of.’ Show that you care for her by being thoughtful. She wants your attention. She wants your time. © Unsplash \n2) She wants you to touch her involuntarily while you guys watch your favourite movie together, even though you’ve seen it a dozen times already. She wants you to caress her waist, her arms, mindlessly drag your fingers along her hand, in her hair. It should come as a habit, something that you do as second nature. Because nothing should seem more perfect than touching her and effortlessly caressing her. © Flickr \n3) She wants you to cook for her. Nothing elaborate or fancy, just a simple breakfast with her favourite cuppa made by love, sprinkled with warmth and served in bed, because you know, she has worked very hard this whole week. There is nobody more beautiful than a just-woken-up-but-well-fed girlfriend. © Tumblr \n4) A little PDA goes a long way in the making of a long-lasting relationship. She wants you to love her just as much in front of your friends and tell the world she is important to you. She wants you to joke with her, kiss her cheeks, and put your arms around her — all in a playful manner. She wants you to hold her hands when you’re walking down the road or crossing the street—an action that is more of a reflex, done so effortlessly, it feels like the only thing to do. Of course, she can walk without you holding her hands, but she doesn’t have to, no? © Tumblr \n5) She wants you to surprise her, delight her—nothing fancy, just something that proves you think about her even when you’re pre-occupied with other things. You can leave an hour early from work, go home and make dinner, or you can surprise her by picking her up from the office. Take her to the special place that stands testimony to your love, go for a long drive and just make some beautiful memories. © Flickr \n6) Give her something personal, nothing that costs you half your salary—she was never interested in your money in the first place. Make a gift for her, something very personal, say a T-shirt with a personalized message or a pen-drive full of her favourite films. Something that screams you’ve put a lot of effort and thought process into it. © Thinkstock/Getty Images \n7) You should probably be doing this every day, but she wants you to tell her she’s beautiful and that she takes your breath away every time you see her. It doesn’t satiate her ego, if you’re wondering—it’s something every woman craves for from her soul-mate—a declaration of your admiration from her. It practically takes nothing to sincerely compliment your woman, but it will totally make her day. © Flickr \n8) Small little things, like slow dancing to romantic music, long hugs under a starry night, drinking wine while having deep heart-to-heart conversations and eating brownies together is something that will definitely make your Valentine’s Day an unforgettable one! © helpful \nPhoto: Â© pwrpcm6hedy-freestocks (Main Image)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:24:20.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
