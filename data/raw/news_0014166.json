He was joined by presidential adviser \" Steve Bannon ,\" who was dressed as the Grim Reaper. \nWith encouragement from his sidekick, Baldwin's Trump made a few phone calls from the Oval Office. He told the Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull (Beck Bennett), \"Your reef is failing\" and called Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto (Alex Moffat) a \"bad hombre.\" \nAfter a call to Zimbabwe, the Grim Reaper told POTUS, \"That's enough fun for tonight,\" and asked for his desk back. \n\"Yes, of course, Mr. President,\" Baldwin said before retreating to a miniature replica of the presidential desk, complete with a toy. \"That's enough fun for tonight.\" #SNL pic.twitter.com/6pJeCJaV6U — Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) February 5, 2017 Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2kBot0S Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T13:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:51:09.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
