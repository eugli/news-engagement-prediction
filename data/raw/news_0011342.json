HIGHLIGHT AND SHARE   Danish Ismail / Reuters ADVERTISEMENT \nIn the latest case of ill-treatment of personnels in the armed forces, another CRPF jawan has alleged that he was tortured by his seniors. \nThe Hindustan Times reports that Sanjeev Ranjan Singh, who is posted at the 159th battalion of the CRPF in Bihar's Gaya, in a letter to Rajnath Singh has alleged that his demand to be transferred to Telangana's Ranga Reddy district fell to deaf ears. He also alleged that because of the hectic nature of his job, he was unable to attend to his sick wife, son and mother. \nHowever, all these charges have been denied by the CRPF. \nThe Hindustan Times quoted CRPF commandant Dhirendra Verma as saying, \"Singh never came to me with his complaint. He was scheduled to re-join duty on January 23 after 20 days leave. He told his immediate superiors that he would not join duty now. We have now initiated departmental proceedings against him.\" \nThis incident comes close on the heels of several jawans from different armed forces complaining of torture, harassment and poor living and work conditions. They have complained of not having enough time off and extreme work hours. \nBSF jawan Tej Bahadur Yadav had created quite a stir after he had complained about the quality of food in a video. After video went viral, while the authorities promised to look into the matter, Yadav alleged that he was transferred and had been given a plumber's job. \nYadav's wife had later alleged that he was arrested and mentally tortured. \nRight after Yadav's video, a CRPF constable had put out a video complaining about the poor conditions in which CRPF jawans have to perform their duties. \nAnother army man, in a video, had alleged that soldiers were being exploited by the officers. He had said, \"I have been in the army for 15 years. I have been concerned about the exploitation of jawans in the army, I was gathering courage to raise my voice. All powers are with the officers... if we complain, they get angry and take action against us,\" he had said. \nAlso In HuffPost India Gorgeous Photos Of Delhi's Native Trees Gorgeous Photos Of Delhi's Native Trees 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:17:31.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
