Key points: Voters, residents misled about Roe 8, Conservation Council says Labor wants to scrap project but will not commit to royal commission Lives will be lost if Roe 8 is not built, Premier Colin Barnett says \nThe Barnett Government has begun work on Roe 8 to extend the highway by 5 kilometres from its current Kwinana Freeway end in Jandakot to Stock Road in Coolbellup, through the Beeliar Wetlands. \nIt is the first section of the freight link, a heavy haulage route designed to get freight to Fremantle Port, however Labor has vowed to scrap the project if it wins the March state election . \nThe council's director Piers Verstegen described Roe 8 as \"an environmental, economic and planning disaster\". \n\"This project is one of the worst failures of government and law in Western Australia,\" he said. \n\"We need a royal commission to investigate every element of this project, right back from the beginning where the planning of it was started.\" \nMr Verstegen accused the Government of misleading the public on the costs of Roe 8, as well as residents about the fate of their homes. \nLabor's candidate for the North Metropolitan region, Alannah MacTiernan, said the party had not yet committed to a royal commission if it were to win power. \nBut she said Labor would reverse the work that had already been done. \n\"Our fundamental principle is that we want to get on with the proper planning for our metropolitan freight, and our commitment will be that there will be complete transparency about that process,\" she said. WA Labor's vow to scrap Roe 8 will have far-reaching impacts and form a large part of the state election campaign. \nMore than 1,000 people attended a rally in Fremantle's Kings Square on Sunday to oppose Roe 8. \nFormer broadcaster Peter Holland was among the speakers and listed the areas where he believed the Government needed to improve.. \n\"Better planning decisions, better transport options, better use of our tax dollars â€” we deserve more honesty and less secrecy from our State Government,\" he said. \n\"Clearly, and as now seems generally recognised in the wider community, we need a new State Government.\" 'Absolute nonsense': Barnett \nPremier Colin Barnett called for greater media scrutiny of the project area, which he said was smaller than people had been led to believe.

(ABC TV News) \nHe said the road would go between the lakes. \n\"To the media, I wish you'd stop talking to each other and actually go out there and have a look. It impacts on less than 1 per cent of the total area,\" he said. \n\"Basically what you're going to have is two lanes going one way, a median strip in the middle and two lanes going the other way. It is a very narrow slither of land that has minimal impact. \n\"And frankly, if Roe 8 is not built, lives will be lost, lives will be lost in traffic accidents.\" \nMr Barnett said thousands of vehicles would be taken off suburban roads to improve the safety of residents in the southern suburbs. \n\"This project has been in the planning forever. They can have a royal commission, they can do whatever they want to, it is absolute nonsense,\" he said. \nMr Barnett also extolled the environmental credentials of the Liberals, referring to the quality of the Swan River and the protection of the Kimberley region.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:50:40.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
