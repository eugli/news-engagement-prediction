(Photo: Instagram) Women in Indian society are often expected to kowtow to patriarchal norms especially when their achievements seem to appear as a threat to the jealous male ago. The dreams of many women have been stifled as a result of such harmful notions. Twitter user Usman Ghani recently posted a thread of tweets about his friend’s tragic experience which quickly went viral.\nThrough his tweets, Ghani narrated the depressing story of a former classmate who was a brilliant student but had to give up her ambitions because her parents couldn’t bear her living a single life. Now she is left stuck in an abusive marriage without any financial independence and strong support system.\nSomething's been pinching me for some days now. Thought of letting it out of my system by sharing it here. Here goes\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nThere was this girl in my school, back in 90's. Brilliant, studious, hard working, very confident, a topper, a debater, a class prefect....\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nWe were class fellows. She was the kind of girl with whom boys talked after rehearsing. Despite mad competition between us, we were friends.\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nI guess the proudest moments of my school and college life were whenever I scored better than her in exams. Couldn't beat her in confidence\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nWe both chose engineering after college and graduated. I chose to work in an industry and she chose to pursue Masters in engineering.\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nLater, she joined one of the best universities of the country as a lecturer in Engineering. That's when her parents decided to marry her off\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nAn arranged marriage in a well off family meant that she had to quit job & live as a house wife. This wasn't all, guy was a college dropout.\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nAn arranged marriage in a well off family meant that she had to quit job & live as a house wife. This wasn't all, guy was a college dropout.\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nShe resisted as much as she could. But after sometime, she agreed to everything saying, \"my parents are too old& scared of me being single\".\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nParents, too old and too scared. That was the reason for this brilliant girl to give up all her dreams, her ego and her career.\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nThe guy was nearly an uneducated, spoiled brat of a business family who couldn't stomach a woman having an education, or an opinion, or ego.\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nIn no time after her wedding she realized that he was verbally and physically abusive and his family supported and encouraged all this.\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nBut she kept quiet in the face of all abuse because her parents were too old and too scared.\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nShe had no money to spend on herself and her husband never bothered to give her a penny. She had already quit her job. So there was no way.\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nVery recently she texted me that her husband had beaten her and given her talaaq twice and if after two times talaaq she could live with him\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nShocked, I asked why would she live with a man so abusive and so insulting.\nHer reply was, \"My parents are too old.... sick and scared.\"\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nGirls! Your parents love you. But one day, they will be old, sick and scared. DO NOT QUIT YOUR CAREER FOR MARRIAGE.\nEarn you own money.\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nIt does not matter if you're thirty or thirty five, do not marry, I say DO NOT MARRY a man you feel is unsuitable for you.\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nParents! One day, you will be old, sick and scared. Please raise your daughters as persons and not as commodity. Let them work and earn.\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nParents! Don't panic if your girl is in 30's & single. Let her pursue her dreams. Don't blackmail your girl for marriage. This isn't love.\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nIt does not matter if you're thirty or thirty five, do not marry, I say DO NOT MARRY a man you feel is unsuitable for you.\n— Usman Ghani (@UGpk) February 15, 2017\nThe account struck a chord with others on social media as well.\n@UGpk Pleasantly surprised by this account coming from a man amongst us. Rare. Respect!\n— NZehra (@NZehra_) February 17, 2017\n@UGpk you'll be a great parent someday.
