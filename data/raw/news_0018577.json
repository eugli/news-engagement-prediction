His complaint: The upscale retailer dropped his daughter's fashion line â a month ago. \nLater, he lent the Oval Office to Intel's CEO for an infomercial. \nHe caught flak for both choices. But the most biting criticism of the day may have come from his nominee for the Supreme Court, who told one senator that he found Trump's attack on a \"so-called judge\" â for halting his ban on immigrants from seven Muslim countries â \"disheartening.\" \nTrump's big victory of the day came Wednesday evening, when the Senate confirmed Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general â 31 years after the Senate rejected his nomination to be a federal judge. Highlight of the day \nIn his short tenure as president, Trump has expressed deep disdain for an independent judiciary. That earned a rebuke Wednesday from the judge he named a week earlier to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch. \nOn Saturday, Trump blasted the \"so-called judge\" in Seattle who agreed to temporarily halt his order barring immigration from seven Muslim countries. He ramped up his criticism of the judiciary in a speech to sheriffs and police chiefs Wednesday, the morning after a federal appeals court hearing on the order that he called \"disgraceful.\" \nThe comments did not go unnoticed by Gorsuch. By late afternoon, the Denver federal judge had told Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., that he found the president's views toward the judiciary \"demoralizing\" and \"disheartening.\" \nRon Bonjean, a GOP strategist tapped by the White House to shepherd the judge through the confirmation process, confirmed the comments . Some pundits chalked up Gorsuch's stance to a political imperative; he'll need some Democratic support for confirmation to a lifetime job on the high court. Dissenting voices Sen. John McCain speaks to reporters at the Senate on Jan. 31 (Al Drago/The New York Times) \nThe White House faced tough questions Wednesday about a commando raid in Yemen that cost the life of Navy SEAL William \"Ryan\" Owens. \nYemen's government revoked its permission for U.S. ground operations against terrorists, amid complaints about civilian casualties. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, asserted Tuesday that the raid â the first approved by Trump â was not the success depicted by the White House. \nThe push back was fierce. \n\"Anybody who undermines the success of that rage owes an apology and disservice to the life of Chief Owens,\" said White House spokesman Sean Spicer, who meant to call it a raid.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Family ties \nOn Wednesday morning, the president of the United States took to Twitter to complain about the upscale department store chain Nordstrom's decision to discontinue the fashion line of his daughter Ivanka. Nordstrom treated her \"so unfairly,\" read the tweet from his personal @realDonaldTrump account (24.2 million followers) â which was quickly retweeted by his official @POTUS account (15.1 million followers). My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom . She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 \nThe time stamp suggested the president was multitasking during his daily intelligence briefing. White House schedule says his Daily Intelligence Briefing was at 10:30am. This was the tweet he sent at 10:51am. đ https://t.co/THnW6IQ8G9 — Kal Penn (@kalpenn) February 8, 2017 \n\"I've heard the conjecture. He was free when that happened. Thank you for asking,\" Spicer said when asked at the daily press briefing about the timing of the tweets. \nNordstrom stock ended the day up 4 percent . \nThe company said it told Ivanka Trump about the decision more than a month ago, which raised questions about what took the president so long to complain and why he picked this day to go public. \n\"We made this decision based on performance,\" a spokesman for the retailer said by email. \"Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn't make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now. We've had a great relationship with the Ivanka Trump team. We've had open conversations with them over the past year to share what we've seen and Ivanka was personally informed of our decision in early January.\" \nTrump's actions crossed a line, according to government ethics experts. \n\"This is misuse of public office for private gains,\" Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer to Republican President George W. Bush, told Reuters . \"And it is abuse of power because the official message is clear â Nordstrom is persona non grata with the administration.\" \nDemocrats pounced, too. \n\"It's totally inappropriate. But he's a totally inappropriate president, so it's totally in keeping with who he is,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, though she added that the \"so-called judge\" comment was worse because \"now we're talking about the separation of power, not the thin skin of an incompetent president.\" \nAides defended the president's tweets. \n\"He ran for president. He won. He's leading this country,\" Spicer said. \"And I think for people to take out their concern about his actions or his executive orders on members of his family â he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success.\" Trumpspeak \nIn criticizing judges who have so far failed to back up his claim of executive authority to halt immigration from seven Muslim countries, Trump asserted that the law is clear enough even for a bad high school student to comprehend. \"You don't have to be a lawyer. If you were a good student in high school or a bad student in high school, you can understand this,\" Trump told an audience of sheriffs and police chiefs. \n\"I was a good student. I understand things. I comprehend very well, OK? Better than, I think, almost anybody. And I want to tell you, I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful. It was disgraceful because what I just read to you is what we have. And it just can't be written any plainer or better and for us to be going through this.\" Business of business \nTrump invited Intel CEO Brian Krzanich to the Oval Office to give him a high-profile platform from which to announce a $7 billion semiconductor chip factory in Arizona. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich joined Trump in the Oval Office, where he announced a $7 billion factory in Chandler, Ariz., to create advanced semiconductor chips. (Chris Kleponis-Pool/Getty Images) \nIt turned out that Intel touted the same factory in 2012 with President Barack Obama. \n\"Let's stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas,\" Obama said at the time. \"Let's reward companies like Intel that are investing and creating jobs right here in the United States of America.\" \nBy 2014, Intel had suspended plans to expand the plant dubbed \"Fab 42,\" a delay it blamed on lower than projected demand. The company now says it will open the plant with four years, adding about 3,000 jobs. Krzanich credited Trump's \"advantageous\" policies toward business. \n\"It's really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:18:12.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
