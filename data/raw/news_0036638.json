From Super Mario World to Bloodborne, Sonic The Hedgehog to The Last Of Us, the list of games is huge and full of fond memories and amazing experiences. But what turns a great game into an amazing game? That is subjective. For some it is the immersion, the story. Some relish in the multiplayer and social interaction, while some love the challenge and reward for beating that challenge. Maybe it is all of those things and more. \nFor me though, one thing that really drives a games experience home and has me coming back again and again is the score. The music. A well composed soundtrack can make a great game a true masterpiece and one that will be remembered for all time. Shadow Of The Colossus is a great game, but with that music it is a masterpiece. A great soundtrack is why, despite its many flaws, I like Final Fantasy VIII above all others in the series. I maintain that Final Fantasy VIII’s soundtrack is the greatest soundtrack the great Uematsu has ever penned, and I don’t care if you disagree. \nIn November 2011, I went to the Royal Albert Hall in London to the Final Fantasy Distant Worlds Concert. As a long-time fan of the series, it was a truly awe-inspiring experience. Hearing my favourite tracks played in such an iconic setting, fully orchestrated, was amazing. And as I write this I am wondering why I haven’t returned. Maybe, I’ll treat myself to a birthday trip to London, as the show returns on the 4th November this year. \nIn 2014 I was fortunate enough to get in on the Video Games Live tour (thanks to whoever mentioned it on this very site) which played at the London Eventim Apollo. That show rocked, literally. The atmosphere of the crowd was exhilarating and the show was just mind-blowing (not to mention the many StreetPass hits I got on my 3DS). Unfortunately, there are no future dates in the UK but I’m sure Tommy and co. will return here sometime. \nIt’s funny how video game music tends to get shunned by the wider public though. I don’t know if you have had the same experience as me, but the number of times I have gotten funny looks when someone has asked me what I am listening to and I say ‘The soundtrack to Dark Souls’ or some other such game. \nI once got a funny reaction when I said I was listening to the GTA: Vice City soundtrack and that is full of ‘normal’ music. If I had a pound for every time someone rolled their eyes and scoffed, but why is this? Listening to the soundtrack of a movie is no different, right? But no one seems to mind that. Movie soundtracks are widely accepted and appreciated, why not games? I don’t know the answer but I have a lot of hope for the future as it seems game music is getting more and more positive recognition. \nLet me sing praise for something for a moment, this may seem like an advert (I promise I’m not getting paid) but I just want to share this with any like-minded gamers out there. This year for Valentine’s Day, the Mrs and I decided we would forgo gifts as we had planned to go out for a nice meal. The wife couldn’t help herself though and she ordered a little something for me (forcing me to make a last minute dash to the shops to find something for her). \nTo my surprise it was a CD, but not just any CD. A CD of someone I had never heard of before, a talented cello player by the name of Tina Guo – apparently the misses saw her on a breakfast news show. I’m not sure how I missed this talented lady but the album in question is her debut album called Game On! To my surprise it is a 14-track album of video game music. Compositions of some of the most well know games and most iconic pieces of music in gaming history. With tracks for Zelda, Mario, Chrono Trigger, and Pokémon (which is fantastic); epic pieces of Skyrim, Uncharted, The Witcher 3. and Metal Gear Solid. And of course a medley of Final Fantasy VII. \nMy favourite piece though, which I am listening to as I write this, is from the beautiful game Journey. A game I only played for the first time last December. A very powerful and emotive piece that hits you right in the chest. Five minutes of pure unadulterated music bliss. If you don’t feel anything listening to this track, or this album in fact, you may want to get yourself checked out; as you may be missing some of your soul. \nSo in closing. If you like video game music, or just like music in general, do yourself a solid and check out Game On by Tina Guo. You will not be disappointed. \nThanks for reading. \nBy reader Halberder84 (gamertag/PSN ID/NN ID) \nPS: Shameless plug for my YouTube channel .
