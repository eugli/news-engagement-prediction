'No work' done by police while youths in custody, court hears \nFour members of the group were remanded in custody last week, to allow police to gather electronic evidence. \nBut today, the court heard no work had been done. \nPaul Edmunds, who represented one of the young people, said his client should not be detained when police had not met their obligations. \n\"What the AFP have failed to do borders on contemptuous,\" he said. \n\"The fact of the matter is they were given a week and they have done nothing.\" \nMagistrate Margaret Hunter agreed, saying she was in a difficult position. \n\"I cannot have young people languishing in Bimberi,\" she said. \n\"It's not a good place to be.\" \nThe prosecution strongly opposed bail, saying they needed more time to gather the evidence and there was a public interest in having the matter properly investigated. \nDuring the course of today's hearing, police said a designated officer was now assigned to the case. \nBut Magistrate Hunter allowed bail for two of the youths, telling one of them the offences attracted a long sentence. \n\"I am going to trust you not to access any information,\" she said. \n\"If you are caught you will go back to Bimberi for a very long time.\" \nThe case will be back in court at a later date.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:30:03.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
