These can be read by the camera of a smartphone. \nMastercard Country Corporate Officer (India) and Division President (South Asia) Porush Singh said the company has developed 'Masterpass QR', which was developed and created at its technology centre in Vadodara. \n\"It is completely 'Made in India'... We look forward to leveraging our technology backbone and partnering with the government and the industry to create a robust, safe and secure digital payments ecosystem,\" he added. \nA number of leading banks are already operationally ready to deploy BharatQR, including SBI, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Citi Union Bank, Development Credit Bank, Karur Vysya Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IDBI Bank, RBL Bank, Union Bank of India, Vijaya Bank and Yes Bank. \nMany other banks are at various stages of implementation. \nMobile wallet companies like Paytm have already been working with QR codes for some time. \nThe Alibaba-backed firm has said it plans to invest Rs 600 \ncrore in the next 10 months to further enhance its QR code-based payments solution. \nMobiKwik Chief Business Officer Vineet Singh saod the BharatQR initiative will help in further advancing the digital payments ecosystem in India. \n\"With one code access, India will achieve its target of being a digital economy sooner... Going forward, we are confident that the government will consider including wallets in Bharat QR,\" he added. \nFirst Published: Tuesday, February 21, 2017 - 00:10 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:59:20.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
