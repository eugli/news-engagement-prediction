Last year, Chicago witnessed a post-recession record number of operating tower cranes , suggesting that the economic deep freeze of the recession is but a memory. Perhaps surprisingly, the only US city to have more construction cranes operating last year was Seattle . \nBut Chicago's construction boom has spread out of the Loop and into the city's neighborhoods, not only seeing the transformation of other downtown areas like the West Loop and the South Loop, but also neighborhoods along Milwaukee Avenue and the Blue Line. \nHundreds of new apartment units have been delivered along the busy Milwaukee Avenue artery over the last couple of years, and hundreds more are on the way. Including all units that have been highlighted on this map, the stretch of Milwaukee Avenue between the Grand Blue Line station and the Logan Square station will eventually see the delivery of 2,252 apartments, 81 for-sale residences, and 89 hotel rooms. These numbers reflect all units that have been delivered, proposed, or are currently under construction. 1 Kenect \nStatus : open Unit count : 227 apartments Located on the western corner of the busy Grand, Milwaukee, and Halsted intersection, this new development in the Fulton River District is big on transit options and is close to several major nightlife and shopping hubs. The development officially opened last autumn.
