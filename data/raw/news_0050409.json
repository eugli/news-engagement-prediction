He should have said: that’s not us. \n“In the lead up, Graham Arnold had been very nice to him ahead of the derby – whether that was mind games or whichever way you want to see it, he said, rightly so, Popovic was doing a great job. \n“(Then,) nothing from Tony Popovic. I find that extraordinary. \n“I find that very, very disappointing and he’s missed an opportunity there to make a statement as the head coach of the Wanderers.” \nSlater admits “he’s taken a bit of a pounding on Twitter” since his hard hitting column in The Daily Telegraph but is aghast that instead of an apology, little remorse has been shown. \n“The Wanderers need to have an investigation into the RBB. Wanderers fans, known as the RBB celebrate. Source: AAP \n“Their official line is there is nothing wrong with it. \n“They need to change the leadership of the RBB. If they think that’s acceptable behaviour in today’s society – put sport aside – they need a change of leadership. \n“As far as them justifying it on the FFA (because of their grievances over the roof body) … I don’t support the FFA in everything they do, and perhaps in other cases with the Wanderers, they have been wrong. That doesn’t justify this very personal banner … that spoilt a wonderful occasion.” \nFor those who took issue with his comment that “I won’t accept them as being part of my sport”, he clarified: Brendon Santalab of the Wanderers celebrates victory Source: Getty Images \n“Of course it’s not my sport. It’s not the FFA’s sport, the club’s sport, the fan’s sport – it’s everyone. \n“They’re (the RBB are) saying the fans run the game. That’s wrong. \n“They’re a very integral part of the sport but they don’t own the game. \n“The Wanderers fans and RBB need to understand – they still don’t get it, they’re trying to justify their position and that horrible, lewd, homophobic , anti-social banner … it had no place in a mainstream sporting event. \n“Out of order, they need to apologise.” \nSlater says his relationship with Graham Arnold, a personal friend, has nothing to do with his position, and also condemned the Sydney FC supporters in The Cove who vandalised their end of the stadium and threw chairs. \n“(Arnold) is my mate, it is true, but it didn’t matter if it was Graham Arnold, or Joe Blogs, or Kevin Muscat, Paul Okon, John Kosmina, Mark Bosnica, Craig Foster … there’s no place for it. \n“For me it’s an evil banner … we love the banter, the humour, sometimes we take it right to the edge, but that’s gone beyond. \n“It needs to be stamped out completely.” \nOf The Sydney FC supporters who misbehaved, he added: “It’s not good enough. It’s a separate incident. It’s not of the vulgar nature of the banner. \n“The Cove fans and Sydney FC have to deal internally with that – not the kind of behaviour we want to see at football games. \n“Sydney FC have got to have an investigation with what’s happened with their fans … “  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:46:28.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
