The parents and two children were sleeping when the cat apparently pawed its way into its owner’s bedroom and bit the mother on the arm to warn her, the Edmonton Journal reported.\nThe County of Grande Prairie Fire Department in Alberta, Canada confirmed the cat was partially responsible for the rescue.\ninfo The cat that was hailed a hero for alerting its family to house fire is rescued by members of the County of Grand Prairie Fire Department in Clairmont, Canada. Close William Vavrek Photography “A cat is being credited with alerting a family to a fire in their home early this morning,” County of Grande Prairie Fire Chief Trevor Grant said in a news statement . “The family escaped the home without any injuries.”\nShortly after fire crews began to put out the fire, freelance photographer William Vavrek arrived on the scene.\n“I arrived to see smoke coming from the trailer,” Vavrek described to CBS News.\nVavrek snapped pictures as firefighters from Clairmont, Dunes and Sexsmith stations worked to contain the fire to the underside of the mobile home. He stood in front of the home and captured the moment as one of the firefighters carefully carried the “heroic” cat down the front stairs.\nHis photo was featured on front pages of local newspapers, and quickly circulated online.\n“Hero kitty,” on Facebook user commented after Vavrek posted the popular picture on his photography page.\n“Fantastic!” another wrote.\nFirefighters are just glad the family, and their loyal feline, are safe. The family connected with the Red Cross Canada, and will be staying elsewhere as officials continue to investigate the fire.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.countygp.ab.ca/assets/News/2017/feb%209%20Family%20pet%20alerts%20Clairmont%20family%20to%20fire.pdf?ftag=MSF0951a18", "https://www.facebook.com/williamvavrekphotography/posts/1449167491762790?ftag=MSF0951a18", "http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/cat-bites-sleeping-alberta-family-member-on-arm-alerting-them-to-burning-home?ftag=MSF0951a18", "http://www.cbsnews.com/?ftag=MSF0951a18"], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:40:25.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
