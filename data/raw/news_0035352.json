And yet. There were collections that stood out from the rest. A long-awaited debut from Raf Simons at Calvin Klein. A goodbye (temporary, we hope) from the Proenza Schouler designers. A coming of age at The Row, where Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen sent out terrific all-grown-up, pared-back tailoring. But that’s not all. Here, in reverse chronological order, the best collections of the week. Marc Jacobs Photo: Indigital.tv Marc Jacobs Take away the set, the music, the out-of-this world hair and makeup, the celeb-stuffed front row (well, save for Katy Perry), and Marc Jacobs is still New York’s consummate showman. His Park Avenue wall of speakers street party will easily go down as the most Instagrammed moment of the week. Super coats and hats, too. Thom Browne Photo: Indigital.tv Thom Browne The suit is the thing for Thom Browne—always has been, always will be. At a moment when tailoring is turning on a lot of other designers, that makes him especially relevant, and there were some beauties here. But what made this collection stand out were the ways Browne extrapolated his natty nature. See: the extraordinary puffer jackets. Michael Kors Collection Photo: Alessandro Garofalo / Indigital.tv Michael Kors Collection Michael Kors has excelled at balancing all-American practicality and New York glamour from the beginning. His new Fall collection has a particularly sexy spin, heavy on animal spots and sparkle, but he amped up the comfort factor too, swaddling the neck and shoulders in cashmere and shearling. Call it a win-win. Coach Photo: Getty Images Coach 1941 In his three years at Coach 1941, Stuart Vevers has turned it into New York’s go-to label for statement outerwear; in 2017 it is way more than a heritage handbag brand. Vevers’s Fall standouts include some truly next-level puffer parkas in delicate American Prairie–inspired prints. Proenza Schouler Photo: Indigital.tv Proenza Schouler Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez are giving Paris a go later this year, in an effort to grow their business internationally. The deconstructed outerwear with graphic logo treatments and slick, twisted leather dresses they’ve designed for Fall are confirmation of just how much New York will miss them. Loading The Row Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen’s show was the one you heard editors talking about most breathlessly afterward. Not because of Instagram moments (none to speak of), celebrity sightings (again, zero), or any of the usual hullabaloo. But because the designing sisters so perfectly synthesized the subtle yet strong way fashion insiders want to dress now. Gypsy Sport Photo: Getty Images Gypsy Sport Many designers addressed the political and social turmoil of our current moment, but no one did it as movingly as Gypsy Sport’s Rio Uribe, who spoke out about the injustices we all witness daily. Importantly, his clothes weren’t just a supporting act. We expect twisted takes of street wear from this up-and-comer, but his off-kilter pinstriped suiting was a clever step forward. Calvin Klein Photo: Getty Images Calvin Klein Raf Simons made his long-awaited Calvin Klein debut, and, as expected, it was the week’s major moment. With his creative director Pieter Mulier at his side, Simons set the template for the brand going forward. Calvin-isms like denim, tailoring, and the slip dress got a rethink, as did the company’s 39th Street headquarters, courtesy of the artist Sterling Ruby. It will be fascinating to watch this Belgian star put his stamp on America’s most recognized fashion brand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T19:19:39.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
