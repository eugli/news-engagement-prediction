That's how I view it,\" Maher said during a March 1998 episode of Politically Incorrect . \n\"Basically, they're having a family and they're keeping the mother in jail because she won't conform to what society feels should be the perfect American family.\" \nMaher again defended the inappropriate relationship during a 2007 interview with Playboy magazine. \n\"I think it’s a little offbeat, but you know, I believe in the double standard. If a 28-year-old male teacher is s---wing a 13-year-old girl, that’s a crime. But with Debra Lafave s---wing her 14-year-old boy student, the crime is that we didn’t get it on videotape,\" he said. \n\"Was he being taken advantage of? I wish I had been taken advantage of like that. What a memory she gave him! I would think he’s a champion among his friends.\" \nMaher added that it was reasonable for Letourneau to be fired, but she should not have been imprisoned as it \"was true love,\" and queried \"how can a woman rape a man?\" \nHBO, the television network which broadcasts Real Time with Bill Maher , are yet to comment. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:08:13.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
