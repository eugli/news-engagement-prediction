It stalled in previous sessions. \nThe bill still needs final Senate approval Wednesday, then must clear the state House. But Gov. Greg Abbott has made it an “emergency item” speeding up that process. \nThe proposal denies state grant money to jurisdictions where police refuse federal requests to surrender immigrants already in custody for possible deportation. \nAbbott also has called for removing from office locally elected officials resisting such requests. \nGovernor Abbott released the following statement: “As Governor, I will not tolerate sanctuary city policies that put the citizens of Texas at risk. Elected officials do not get to pick and choose which laws they will obey. Today’s action in the Senate helps ensure that Sheriffs and officials across Texas comply with federal immigration laws and honor Immigration and Custom Enforcement detainer requests that keep dangerous criminals off of our streets. I want to thank Senator Perry for his leadership on this issue and look forward to final passage in the Senate tomorrow.” Lt. Governor Dan Patrick released this statement: “No city in Texas should be allowed to ignore the law. I congratulate Sen. Perry on today’s vote in the Senate to pass SB 4 and thank him for his commitment to keeping our communities safe. Ending sanctuary cities was one of my top priorities and I am pleased that we are acting swiftly on the agenda of the people of Texas.” (©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
