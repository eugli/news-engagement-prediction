February 2, 2017 10:53 PM 1 / 11 Photo: Getty Images When news broke that Lady Gaga would be performing at this year’s Super bowl halftime show, fashion expectations for the occasion went through the roof. The costumes have historically always been larger than life: Madonna arrived in golden Givenchy flanked by an army of backup dancers in 2012, Katy Perry brought out flame-covered Jeremy Scott in 2015, and Beyoncé pulled out a Dsquared2 look that paid homage to the King of Pop last year. In other words, an NFL jersey and a pair of jeans is not going to cut it. As music’s most radical dresser, Gaga has never shied away from wearing the wildest styles imaginable, and what better place than at America’s most watched sporting event to debut an imaginative new look. It remains to be seen what Gaga and her stylist Brandon Maxwell will come up with for Sunday night’s show, though there are plenty of suitably exciting options out there. It isn’t hard to imagine Gaga dancing up a storm in Marc Jacobs ’s rave-inspired Spring collection or belting out “Poker Face” while wearing a latex Balenciaga cape; even the simplicity of one of Maxwell’s streamlined suits could prove a bold choice. While Gaga’s reputation for taking risks means that she’s likely to go for boldness—and multiple outfit changes—we certainly wouldn’t mind seeing her in these 10 runway looks.
