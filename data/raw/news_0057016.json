According to the reviews on Amazon, the keyboard is full-sized and completely wood (no plastic parts). It also comes with a free touch pen, so you're getting three items in the deal. \nThe keyboard works with both Windows and Mac products, so anyone can use it. For $42.99 , it's not only a great way to make your office more attractive, but it's a conversation starter when people visit your workspace and realize how stylish you are.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:24:46.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
