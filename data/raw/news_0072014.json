Mail icon \nël Gillon, an exoplanet researcher at the University of Liège in Belgium. \"Now we have seven Earth-sized planets to expand our understanding. Yes, we have the possibility to find water and life . But even if we don't, whatever we find will be super interesting.\" \nEarthlike \" is a generous term to describe these worlds. Though the planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system resemble Earth in terms of size, mass, and the energy they receive from their star, there's a lot that makes our planet livable beside being a warm rock. Further observation is required to figure out what the TRAPPIST-1 planets are made of, if they have atmospheres, and whether they hold water, methane, oxygen and carbon dioxide — the molecules that scientists consider \"biosignatures,\" or signs of life. \nir perspective, it appears about three times as large as our sun. The outermost planets enjoy the daily spectacle of their neighbors passing across the sky and in front of their shared sun, each world a large dark spot silhouetted against the salmon-colored star. Its dim glow, which skews toward the red and infrared end of the light spectrum, bathes the planets in warmth and paints their skies with the crimson hues of a perpetual sunset. \n— and blocking some of its light. Last May, the scientists published their discovery in Nature: three rocky bodies, dubbed TRAPPIST-1b, -1c and -1d, orbited the small star, they said. \n— giving a sense of how much iron, rock, water and gas the bodies contain. \nconcentrate on the outer edges of solar systems. \n— the water bearer. \nanother world,\" Adams said, \"h ow much it has to look exactly like Earth, and how different life could be elsewhere.\" our guidelines | Comments FAQ \nreat other participants with respect and in a way that you would want to be treated.
