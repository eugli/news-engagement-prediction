More than 60 per cent of the US employees of Infosys hold H-1B visas. \n\nA global pact on services trade would go a long way towards settling disputes over professional visas, Sitharaman said. \n\n\"If only there is a framework ... you will know how movement can happen and how certain restrictions can or cannot come,\" she said. \"It's time for countries to sit together and look at it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T17:23:43.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
