REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque 2/2 \nOSLO Norway has joined an international initiative to raise millions of dollars to replace shortfalls left by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on U.S.-funded groups worldwide providing information on abortion. \nIn January, the Netherlands started a global fund to help women access abortion services, saying Trump's \"global gag rule\" meant a funding gap of $600 million (£481.1 million) over the next four years, and has pledged $10 million to the initiative to replace that. \nSweden, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg, Finland, Canada and Cape Verde have all also lent their support. \n\"The government is increasing its support for family planning and safe abortion by 85 million Norwegian crowns (£8.1 million) compared with 2016,\" Prime Minister Erna Solberg said. \n\"At a time when this agenda has come under pressure, a joint effort is particularly important,\" he said in a statement. \nLast month, Trump reinstated a policy requiring overseas organisations that receive U.S. family-planning funds to certify they do not perform abortions or provide abortion advice as a method of family planning. \n(Reporting by Gwladys Fouche; Editing by Louise Ireland) Next In World News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:45:42.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
