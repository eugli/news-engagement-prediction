The Hangover wasn’t called Bad Groomsmen. How about Bad Script, Bad Directing. The women’s improving was the only thing that made this movie funny or watchable. I seriously felt like the writers took an old, formulaic, paint-by-numbers script and typed the actresses names into it, or that they wrote it in 3 days, tops. I thought it was funny they heavy-handed male entitlement in the film to the point where I thought they were actually mocking the women, but this poor script and directing is the perfect example of white male entitlement thinking they can just crank out a script about women and mothers with seemingly zero knowledge and call it a day. This was a poor excuse to compete with Sisters. Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn were the only thing to give this any humor or life, and Mila is likable even if the writers and directors did not give the women much to work with, particularly Applegate and Jada’s identical, one-dimensional characters. Their talents were severely neglected and underused. No", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:09:08.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
