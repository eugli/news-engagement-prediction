Sporting News \nPublished on Jan. 31, 2017 \nJan. 31, 2017 \nNick Kyrgios returned from the US on Monday, ready for Australia’s Davis Cup tie with the Czech Republic, but Bernard Tomic won’t be turning out in the green and gold. \nIt’s a situation Kyrgios, who is fresh off his bewildering second round Australian Open exit, says there’s no need for. \nTomic announced last week that he would unavailable for the tie, stating scheduling issues. \n“I think we’ve got a great opportunity to win this year,” said Kyrgios. \n“We’ve got a really good line-up – a lot of depth. You’ not going to beg guys to play, but it’s disappointing not having him here. \n“There’s no reason why he should not be here.” \nKyrgios joins Sam Groth, Jordan Thompson and doubles partner John Peers against the Czech Republic, with Australia’s captain Lleyton Hewitt saying he’s only interested in players who want to be there. \n“In some ways it’s disappointing,” he said. \n“It’s probably more frustrating I think. I’ve done a lot of work with (Thompson) over the last few months and he’d do anything to get out here and play in the green and gold. I couldn’t be prouder. \n“I want all the boys to be committed to playing Davis Cup. It’s a fantastic opportunity, we don’t get to come together to play for you country. \n“This is the one opportunity we get each year. \n“At the end of the day, I’m not going to beg guys to play for their country. You’ve got to want to come out here and represent your country.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:07:59.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
