In a sneak peek of Teen Mom 2’ s February 27 episode, Babs talks to producer Kristen about what happened in court, and she gets choked up thinking about the possibility of losing her grandson for good. \nAfter giving Kristen the low-down on what types of questions her lawyer asked Jenelle — Jenelle’s ex boyfriends, her living situation and her job situation were brought up, of course — Babs gets real about what might happen next.“She did this herself,” Babs says. “If it doesn’t go her way she’s going to be devastated and if it doesn’t go my way, Jace is going to be devastated.” Credit: MTV \nKristen makes a good point, though — didn’t Barbara say on previous seasons she’ll give Jace back to his mom once she gets her life in order? \n\n“She’s slowly growing up but I don’t think she’s made it there yet,” she admits. “If there wasn’t a guy around in her life, then I don’t know if she’d be able to raise all these kids alone.” \nThen comes the kicker. \nBarbara gets emotional when asked what’ll happen if she ends up losing the 7-year-old. \n“If that’s what it is then that’s what it is,” she says, holding back tears. “I really don’t want to think of that.” \nUs either! \n\nAnother custody battle is playing out over in Delaware, as Kailyn Lowry and Javi Marroquin try to figure out where Lincoln will go on the holidays since they’re divorcing. \nBut the conversation is cut short when Javi questions whether or not Kail puts her kids first as she said she does. Burn! \nLastly, Jeremy Calvert has some news for Leah Messer — he’s engaged! \nAnd though she’s happy for her ex-husband, she tells him to be sure Brooke is the person he wants to marry since, you know, usually marriage is forever. \nShe then proceeds to tell Jeremy their marriage was “the biggest mistake of my life.” Awesome. \nWatch the sneak peeks above and tune into a new episode of Teen Mom 2 on Monday, February 28 at 9 p.m. ET on MTV. \nTeen Mom 2 airs Mondays at 9 p.m. ET on MTV. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint ’s coverage of Teen Mom 2 :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:16:25.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
