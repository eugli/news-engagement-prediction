Employees called 911, Highland Park Fire Chief Kevin Coney said, and did their best to try to put the fire out. \n“‘Help!’ That was all he could say at the time,” Coney told WWJ’s Sandra McNeill. “He was calling for help and they went back there to try to assist him. But being fully engulfed in flames…there’s nothing too much nobody can do but try to put water on him.” \nFirefighters arrived to extinguish the blaze, Coney said, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene. He was burned over half his body. \nThe man has not yet been formally identified.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:10:39.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
