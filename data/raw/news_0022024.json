Bush into a concept album, American Idiot, then, rather bizarrely, into a hit Broadway musical. \nNow after an eight year hiatus of sorts, the Republicans are back in charge. It’s almost like American Idiot wasn’t a reaction but a forecast. \nFrontman Billie Joe Armstrong came to the right place if he wanted solidarity against Trump. Only a few weeks ago the city saw a huge protest against the divisive rhetoric of the new so-called Leader of the Free World. \n“Donald Trump is not my president,” Armstrong spits after finishing his own take on the protest song ‘Holiday’, “He will be gone soon. We will not be divided.” \nThe roar from the vibrant crowd agreed with the sentiment.

One of the stand outs was ‘Revolution Radio’, the title track from their 12th album released last autumn, which was elevated with a raucous pyrotechnics display. \nThere was a welcome lull for the anthemic ‘Boulevard of Broken Dreams’ before the band dusted of a few classics ‘Longview’ and ‘When I Come Around’ from 1994, songs written before half of the audience were probably born, judging on the demographic in the sweaty, bruising mosh pit. \nWhile there was a lot of anger and outrage from Armstrong, there was also one hell of a party - and fancy dress. \nWith the band’s keyboardist Jason Freese taking up the saxophone the crowd caught their breath with an interlude involving a series of unexpected covers including a medley with George Michael’s ‘Careless Whisper’, The Isley Brothers’ ‘Shout’ and Monty Pythons’ ‘Always Look on the bright side of life’.

In ‘Are We The Waiting’ Armstrong manages to conjure an intimate moment amid thousands or adoring fans and the show ends with a nostalgic version of ‘Good Riddance (Time of your life)’. There are also three brilliant moment when fans are welcomed onto the stage to perform with the band, the most notable of which was the starstruck girl who proved herself to be a kick-ass guitarist. \nIt has been more than 30 years since Green Day pogoed onto the punk rock scene. 85 million record sales later and the punk has watered down somewhat. Thankfully the rock hasn’t. And in Trump it seems they’ve found another reason to keep cranking it up.
