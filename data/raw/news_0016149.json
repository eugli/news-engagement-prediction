The episode will feature a version of the Bob Dylan classic “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door” sung by Ferrer and performed by his blues-rock band, the Jenerators. Also, an in-memoriam title card dedicated to Ferrer will appear on screen at the episode’s end. RELATED NCIS: LA ‘s Miguel Ferrer Dead at 61 \nFerrer passed away last month at the age of 61 after a long battle with throat cancer; he played NCIS: LA ‘s Assistant Director Owen Granger for six seasons. A familiar face to TV fans, Ferrer also had memorable roles on ABC’s Twin Peaks (as FBI forensics expert Albert Rosenfield) and NBC’s Crossing Jordan (as medical examiner Dr. Garret Macy), along with dozens of other small-screen appearances through the years. \nNCIS: LA fans haven’t seen the last of Owen Granger, though: Ferrer will appear in the Feb. 19 episode, which was filmed before his death. The actor also finished filming a reprise of his Twin Peaks role in Showtime’s upcoming reboot. If you like TVLine, you'll LOVE our weekly newsletter. Click here to subscribe.
