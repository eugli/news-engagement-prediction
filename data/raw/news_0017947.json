(Credit: Channel 2 Action News) Story Highlights Three people are being sought by police in connection with the sale of fake football tickets. Atlanta police say not only have scalpers been selling fake Falcons tickets to recent football games, they’ve also been giving counterfeit cash as change, Channel 2 Action News reports. Some spent as much as $1,100 for tickets to games such as the NFC championship game in Atlanta , the television station reported. Atlanta police spokesman Sgt. Warren Pickard said he’s personally worked undercover to combat unauthorized buying and selling of tickets.
