Between the DC Extended Universe, Marvel Cinematic Universe, and X-Men franchise, it seems that just about every famous actor and director is getting into bed with a comic book property. And while many audiences and critics are concerned over \"superhero fatigue\", certain movies are groundbreakers for the genre. Case in point: last year's hit Deadpool , which effectively shattered expectations for both superhero movies and R-rated blockbusters. With development for Deadpool 2 still underway, many folks have been wondering who will be joining Ryan Reynolds in the sequel. And the newest rumor is all about Scandal star Kerry Washington. \nLast week , news broke that Kerry Washington was being considered to play the role of mutant Domino in Deadpool 2 . And at the Writers Guild Awards , the actress was asked about this rumor. After revealing that talks haven't really started, she admitted she'd be happy to step into the role if approached. She said, \nOf course I would but you always have to get the right person for whatever role. \nLooks like Olivia Pope is happy to kick some ass and take names in _Deadpool _2. Now it's just a matter of whether or not Fox, Ryan Reynolds , and company think that Kerry Washington is the right actress for the job. \nKerry Washington's statement, which comes to us from Extra , should make Deadpool's many fans happy. The fandom will want a powerhouse actress to play the unique and underrated X-Man Domino, and Washington surely has the acting chops to keep up with the rest of the cast. And while previous reports claimed that The Martian actress Mackenzie Davis was being eyed for the role, there is now a new contender. \nDomino is a pretty interesting member of the X-Men and X-Force, and has quite the past with Deadpool in the comics. Domino has the mutant ability to alter probability. While this seems like a lame power anywhere but Vegas, it actually makes her extremely lethal. Because in addition to her skill as a marksman and hand to hand combat, she has the ability to tip the odds in her favor. That shot that normal marksmen would miss? Domino's got it. \nDomino is also known for dating Deadpool on and off in quite a few X-Men timelines. Additionally, Domino has dated Cable as well, who is also set to debut in Deadpool 2 . Perhaps the two men will be fighting for her affection, while Domino and Deadpool kill plenty of bad guys. \nWhile Kerry Washington certainly is a strong actress, I'm not sure if her resume supports some of the more comedic moments of Deadpool 2 . Ryan Reynolds is a pretty masterful improv comic, and is known to riff and joke around quite a bit on set. Is she funny enough to keep up with Reynolds' trademark snark? I guess we'd just have to wait and see. \nYou can catch Kerry Washington in Scandal on ABC. Stay here with CinemaBlend for updates on all things Deadpool .
