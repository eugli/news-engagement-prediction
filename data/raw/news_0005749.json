(Supplied: Facebook) \nPeople who had read about the specific theft in the Stolen Cars in Darwin Facebook group, a forum for people to post descriptions of their stolen cars so that other users can keep a look-out for them, later came across the vehicle. \n\"We were lucky enough that a member of the public — this had been followed on Facebook by the public — reported that the stolen motor vehicle had been abandoned on the Elizabeth River Bridge on the Channel Island Road,\" Superintendent Burgoyne said. \nBut he said the amateur sleuths hampered police evidence-collecting by walking around the abandoned car. \n\"Because the public were involved with the dumping site of the vehicle our dog was unable to pick up a scent. \n\"So this is always a problem when we do have the public get involved in these sorts of things.\" \nTwo people police suspect to be the drivers of the car were picked up nearby, but no charges were laid due to a lack of evidence, Superintendent Burgoyne said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:07:57.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
