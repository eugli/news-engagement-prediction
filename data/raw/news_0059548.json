In a way, \"The Thirteenth Tale\" is a homage to these and all other great works of literature. \nThe power of books and stories is foremost in the novel, and as the main character gets lost in one story, you'll find yourself lost with her in the story within a story (as well as the story surrounding the character's story). \nThis is not a realistic book. It isn't meant to be. The aura of fairytale lends power and mystery to the writing. While place is utterly important to the book, time is not. Don't try too hard to figure out when the novel is supposed to take place. It could just as easily have been now as a hundred years ago. \nPerhaps all this talk about place, time and story seems roundabout to you. Perhaps you want a synopsis of plot and a straightforward review so that you can decide whether to read this book. Here's what to expect: A good story written by a very good writer about a good story told by a very good writer. \nThis can be a fun read for a book discussion club, especially for the autumn and winter months. See a list of questions you can explore with your book club for \"The Thirteenth Tale.\" The audiobook version is well-received for those who prefer to listen rather than read. \nThe book was adapted for a UK TV movie released in December 2013, starring Vanessa Redgrave and Olivia Colman. Setterfield's second novel, \"Bellman & Black,\" (2013) does not garner as good of reviews. Hopefully her further works will be back up to the standard she set with her first.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:07:36.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
