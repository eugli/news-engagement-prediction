He also said the studio is seeing benefits above and beyond monetary gains with an increase in filmmaker-driven projects since “La La Land” opened in early December. \n“Filmmakers have brought us a lot more movies,” he added. “They see that we are willing to make a bet on an unconventional approach.” \n“La La Land,” a whimsical comedy-drama set in an idealized Los Angeles, stars Emma Stone as an aspiring actress and Ryan Gosling as a struggling jazz musician who fall in and out of love. The movie, which has a $30 million budget, swept the Golden Globes with seven trophies, scored a record-tying 14 Oscar nominations, won the top movie award from the Producers Guild of America , and won a Directors Guild of America trophy for Damien Chazelle.
