Trevor Timon, 31, punched 30-year-old Oliver Dearlove in the head after becoming angry but was today cleared of murder Tim Stewart The 30-year-old, pictured here with his girlfriend, died after being punched in the head \nToday a jury found him not guilty of murder after the fatal punch in August last year. \nMr Dearlove, who lived with his long-term girlfriend in New Eltham, had a brief chat with the woman after spending the evening drinking with old university friends in Blackheath , south-east London. \nTimon, from Plumstead, south-east London, had denied murder but admitted manslaughter shortly before going to trial. \nGiving evidence, he said he left school at 16 with three GCSEs and got a job as a plasterer. \nAfter four years, he became unable to work because of epilepsy, he said. \nHe has a history of violence and a string of convictions dating back to when he was 22 years old, which prosecutor Anthony Orchard QC, said showed “a penchant for violence in a public setting”. \nHe added: “He makes the threats and then punches. He’s fully aware that in punching someone he’s going to cause really serious injury. \n“It’s the level of violence we say is him knowing exactly how strong he is when he punches.” \nTimon pleaded guilty to using threatening, abusive or insulting words and behaviour after angrily shouting at a bus driver while brandishing a golf club on 11 February 2008. 5 Timon, from Plumstead, south-east London, had denied murder but admitted manslaughter \nOn 1 January 2010, police saw him being restrained by his uncle as he shouted and screamed: “As soon as police leave I’m going to start f***ing fighting.” \nTimon pleaded guilty to disorderly behaviour, but was next in trouble with the law on 26 May 2010 after attacking a woman outside a pub. \nIn a statement to police, the victim, who was a senior sales consultant, said she was talking to a group of three men, including a friend called ‘Jay’ when Timon pulled up in a car and said: “Why are you talking to that slag?” \n“Trevor fully got of the car and began quickly walking towards me saying, ‘don’t talk to me’,” she said. \nTimon called her a “w***e”, “crackhead” and “skaghead” throughout the incident and told her: “I’m going to bang you out.” \n“He kept saying he was going to knock me out throughout the incident. \n“I then said to him, “what are you doing, acting like your brother?” RELATED STORIES 'I feel like I have lost it all' Man who killed banker 'poured his heart out to woman in texts moments after attack ‘AGGRESSIVE, PUMPED UP, FIRED’ Pal of murdered city banker Oliver Dearlove denies racial slur before fatal punch 'HE WAS LOOKING FOR A FIGHT' Banker 'killed by man who was out looking for trouble and threw one punch as hard as he could' ONE PUNCH DEATH Who was Oliver Dearlove, why is Trevor Timon accused of punching him and what has happened since? ONE-PUNCH KILL SUSPECT London man, 31, denies murdering former Coutts banker Oliver Dearlove as he appears in court 'JUST GOT AMBUSHED' Shocking injuries of Good Samaritan punched repeatedly in the face in brutal mugging outside Asda \n“I then remember waking up on my left side, laying on the floor. I felt pain to the right side of my face, where I was hit, and to my left shoulder, where I believe I fell.” \nShe was left feeling “dizzy and disoriented” after the attack, over which Timon admitted a charge of battery. \nHis most recent convictions, for common assault and criminal damage, stem from an incident on 17 June 2011, when Timon was ushered out of a pub after closing time. \nHaving been refused re-entry, he threw a punch at a barman, but missed and hit the wall, before saying “I’ll petrol bomb the pub”. \nOn August 27 last year, Timon had met a close female friend and three other women in Morden’s nightclub for a birthday celebration. \nHe bought a bottle of champagne for the women and drank two glasses himself, he said. \nTimon said he felt “happy” and not drunk as they left the club together to get a cab home. SWNS:South West News Service 5 Mr Dearlove had spent the evening in Blackheath, south east London, catching up with old Portsmouth University friends \nHe said he walked up to one of the women to “tell her to hurry up because she had her shoes off”. \nTimon told jurors he asked her “what are you saying?”. \nOne of the young men replied “nothing to you mate”, the defendant said. \nThen it all “closed in” and an argument erupted, he said. \n“We were just standing there having an argument. One of them said ‘she’s with the half chap’. \n“They were laughing at me really, that’s the way I took it. \n“I said ‘what do you find so funny in saying that. Just go away.’ \n“I did say to one of the guys ‘if you don’t get out of my face I will knock you out’. It’s a figure of speech really.” \nOne of the women was urging them to go but the shouting continued, he said. \nDefending, Courtenay Griffiths QC had asked: “Who was the first person to do anything physical?” \nTimon replied: “Me. I punched him. He fell backwards. He just fell. \n“I stood there for a couple of seconds and walked off.” \nAsked what was going through his mind when he threw the punch, Timon said: “Nothing. I just threw a punch. I don’t know.” SWNS:South West News Service Tributes were left to Mr Dearlove after he died from the punch while out last year \nMr Griffiths said: “What were you hoping to achieve?” \nThe defendant replied: “Nothing. I was pissed off.” \nHe continued: “I was shocked. I didn’t think it was that serious. When I got the phone call (from one of the women) to say he was in hospital I was shocked to hear that. I could not believe my punch had led to hospital.” \nTimon said he went to London City Airport and got on a flight to see his mother in Ireland. \nAfter a couple of days, Timon said he returned and went straight to a police station with his father. \nThe court has previously heard Timon had “bad intentions” when he delivered a single powerful knock-out punch . \nMr Dearlove’s fried Andrew Cook gave evidence last week. He said: “There was this guy. \n“I don’t know where he came from. He was just upon us all of a sudden. He came out of nowhere. \n“He just started getting up in our faces. He started getting aggressive, shouting at us something like ‘Who the f*** are you?’ \n“He was very angry and agitated. He pushed me. He got really close to us pointing and shouting at us, being really abusive. \n“He was looking for a fight. Not a nice guy. Trying to start a fight. We didn’t know why, it all happened so quickly.” \nTimon had previously told jurors told jurors he punched the young banker after he was “laughed at” and called a “half chap” . \nHe will be sentenced after admitting manslaughter at the Old Bailey on Friday. \nWe pay for your stories!
