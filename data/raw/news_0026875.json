The former Pro Bowler applied for reinstatement, but the league in December deferred ruling on Smith’s case until March. \nSmith spent his first four years in the NFL with the San Francisco 49ers, who released him after he was arrested on hit-and-run, driving under the influence and vandalism charges in the summer of 2015. Smith last played in 2015 with the Raiders, appearing in nine games and finishing with 3 1/2 sacks. 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:30:20.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
