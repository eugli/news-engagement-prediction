USA TODAY Sports Falcons WR Julio Jones led the NFL in 2016 with more than 100 receiving yards per game. (Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON — Atlanta Falcons star receiver Julio Jones says he and his troublesome toe will be full-go as preparations continue for Super Bowl LI. \n“I’m practicing the whole week,” Jones told reporters Wednesday. \nJones barely practiced in the lead-up to the Jan. 22 NFC Championship Game but nonetheless had a monster game — nine catches for 180 yards and two touchdowns, including a 73-yard score — in the Falcons’ 44-21 rout of the Green Bay Packers. The ultimate Super Bowl LI preview: How do Patriots, Falcons stack up? \nHe missed two games with a sprained toe on his left foot in December, then aggravated the injury in Atlanta’s divisional playoff win over the Seattle Seahawks. He got some limited work last week before the Falcons left for Houston and dismissed the toe as a nonissue. \n“I feel great,” Jones said. \n*** \nFollow Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelissero \nPHOTOS: Falcons' road to Super Bowl LI Facebook Posted!

Ron Chenoy, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 6: Dan Quinn's return to Seattle ended in disappointment as the Falcons fell 26-24 to the Seahawks amid controversy.

The diminutive receiver and free agent pickup took two short passes for touchdowns and had four receptions for 75 yards. Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 13: Eric Berry proved to be a worthy foe for the Falcons, as the Kansas City Chiefs escaped with a 29-28 win. Berry returned one interception and became the first player to return a two-point conversion for a score to seal Kansas City's win. Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 14: Atlanta's defense got in on the scoring in a 42-14 rout of the Los Angeles Rams.
