SEE ALSO: Elon Musk's private escape tunnel is a step closer to becoming a reality \nBack in December, Musk casually dropped the literally earth-shaking news that he planned to build a tunnel leading to his office at SpaceX under the name of The Boring Company. At the time, it sounded like perhaps just another cute yet lofty brain fart from the founder of SpaceX and Tesla . \n‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2017 \nBut with each passing month, Musk has revealed another piece of the puzzle that proves he's absolutely serious about creating a Batcave-style secret tunnel leading to his corporate headquarters. \nThe new tunnel image was posted with no explanation of what exactly it is other than Musk's usual attempt at whimsy by posting a single word with the image: \"Minecraft.\" \nAnd just last week, at least one major TBM company rushed to Twitter to \"assist or advise\" on the project. @elonmusk We'd love to assist or advise on your new TBM venture! We have decades of experience as Trenchless Tunnelling experts! Call us! üìû pic.twitter.com/om0WRYqRml \n‚Äî Terra Solutions Ltd (@Terra_Solutions) January 26, 2017 \nDays later, at a recent event in California showcasing Hyperloop designs, Musk reportedly divulged more detail about his tunnel venture. At @SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, CA, they've started digging a tunnel. Could this be the answer to traffic gridlock? On @TODAYshow . pic.twitter.com/aeVYLY4fVS \n‚Äî Joe Fryer (@joefryer) January 30, 2017 \n\"We have no idea what we‚Äôre doing,‚Äù Musk said, according to the Los Angeles Daily News . \"We‚Äôre going to get this machine, take it apart, figure out how to make it go much faster while still being safe and not affecting people on the surface. We'll see how much progress we can make, but I'm optimistic tunneling can be improved by at least five-fold, maybe 10-fold. That's really key to a lot of technologies ‚Äî road tunnels, train tunnels, Hyperloop tunnels.\" \nThe paper also reports that Musk has obtained a city permit to dig 50 feet below the earth to accommodate his intention to have the tunnel extend from Crenshaw Boulevard to the SpaceX employee parking lot. @elonmusk I'm a mining engineer that works for you at SpaceX, count me in! TBM development will definitely be useful on Mars ;) \n‚Äî Kevin Becker (@kmbecker13) December 20, 2016 \nAlthough it's unclear when the project will be completed or just how useful it will be, at least one SpaceX employee is already hyped about the prospect for tunnel at the company's headquarters, tweeting about the project shortly after Musk announced it on Twitter. \nThat employee also raised an interesting prospect: perhaps this earthbound project is just a test run for Musk's even loftier plan to one day support a colony on the inhospitable red planet ‚Äî that's right, tunnels underneath the surface of Mars!
