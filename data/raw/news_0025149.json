ANDY JACKSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe ATR 72 turboprop, at about US$14.4million, was a relative bargain compared to the pricier Airbus A320. \nThe changes included adding seven more daily return services on the route between Wellington and Christchurch, bringing the total number to 20. Of these, just two were operated by the more comfortable but costly Airbus A320 jets, while 68-seat ATR 72 turboprops served the majority. \nREAD MORE: \nChristchurch businessman and frequent flyer Kevin Dore, who wrote an opinion piece last August criticising the ATRs as slower, noisier and more cramped, said on Friday that the service on main trunk routes was just as bad, if not worse. BEVAN READ/FAIRFAX NZ \nAir New Zealand runs Airbus A320 jets between Wellington and Auckland. \n\"The situation with Air New Zealand hasn't changed,\" he said. \"It's a real farce. In fact, we're gone backwards. We used to enjoy a bit of comfort but now we have to walk a long, long way to the gate and across the tarmac to the plane in all weathers. \n\"You can forget about using the Koru lounge because it's even further away. The plane's loud and cramped and we have to wait for the ground crew to unload the baggage before we can get off.\" \nDore, who holds a private pilot's licence, contended that Christchurch customers are getting a raw deal as they pay the same for turboprop services as they do for the jet services in peak hours, adding that the airline \"wouldn't dare\" put a turboprop on an Auckland to Wellington route. \nJets often replace turboprops into Christchurch if special events meant more people are travelling than usual, Kelly Kilgour said. \nPeter Wilson, principal economist at NZIER, said that Air New Zealand would have to balance the cost of flights against revenue. Ad Feedback \n\"The larger jets cost a lot and the airline has to recover that cost from passengers over the life of the aircraft. That translates into bums on seats, literally. If they can't fill any plane, then it will not be paying its way. \n\"It is always a careful balancing act between providing customers with a quick, comfortable ride on a larger plane, against the cost saving of using ATRs.\" \nFor their airline, there were both variable costs (such as fuel and landing fees), which went up with more passengers, and fixed costs (such as the price of the planes) which didn't, he explained. \nAccording to aircraft comparison website axlegeeks, an Airbus A320 cost an average US$98 million (NZ$136 million), making the ATR 72, at about US$14.4m, a relative bargain. The ATR was also cheaper to operate, burning US$11.08 of fuel per nautical mile compare to the Airbus' US$13.07. \nManufacturer ATR Aircraft contended that airlines could save more than two million litres of fuel per year by replacing one regional jet with one of its turboprops. \nAir New Zealand regularly reviewed its schedule to ensure it was best matching capacity with demand, and Kilgour said jets often replaced the turboprops between Wellington and Christchurch if special events meant more people are travelling than usual. \nIn Dore's view, however, it was the regular travellers who were suffering. \n\"It's not more services that we're after. We'd be happy to have less services but better quality. I'd like to be able to say I support Air New Zealand but the whole situation is a disgrace - that's the only word for it. \nDore insisted that flights between Wellington and Christchurch are always \"chocca full\", meaning demand shouldn't be an issue. \n\"If [the reason for using ATRs over jets] is purely financial, why don't they test them on the Auckland route?\" he asked. \nSouth Island travellers were also disgruntled by reduced flights in some areas, including the axing of direct flights between Christchurch and Blenheim. \nAir New Zealand reorganised its regional routes in 2015 as it struggled to fill 50-seat aircraft in some areas. \nIts last flight between Christchurch and Blenheim, a route the airline described as a \"loss-making service\", was in July 2016. \nThe carrier also dropped flights between Wellington and Taupo, and Wellington and Westport, but all three were picked up by Sounds Air, which also added flights between Blenheim and Napier. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:53:58.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
