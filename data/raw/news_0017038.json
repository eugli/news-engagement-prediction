Prakash has decided to take a traditional approach by carry­ing a paal kavadi (a small wooden or steel contraption with two containers of milk) for Thaipusam this year. \n“I have been carrying kavadi for the past 13 years but it is usually the kavadi with fancy designs and patterns. I decided to take a more traditional approach and carry the paal kavadi as I find it is more symbolic. \n“I noticed that a fancy kavadi does not last and cannot be reused unless you are careful with it and have enough storage space at home. \n“The paal kavadi can be kept for years and I intend to pass it down to my children,” he said when met at his house in Bandar Baru Air Itam yesterday. \nPrakash, 31, said he had his paal kavadi custom made in stainless steel and decorated it with cloth and ornaments from India. \n“A paal kavadi is usually made of wood but I want to make sure mine can be reused for years to come. \n“I will also be carrying 200 mini silver pots filled with vibuthi (holy ash) which will be hooked to my body,” he said. \nPrakash who works as an advertising sales representative at the Star Media Group, first made a vow to carry kavadi after his father met with an accident 13 years ago and was told he would never walk again. \n“I made a vow to carry a kavadi if he reco­vered. Since then, there has been no looking back as I feel I have received many blessings along the way. \n“My father has since fully recovered and can walk normally,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:14:29.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
