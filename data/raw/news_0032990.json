Newsy Yahoo issues yet another warning in fallout from hacks Yahoo is warning users of potentially malicious activity on their accounts between 2015 and 2016, the latest development in the internet company's investigation of a mega-breach that exposed 1 billion users' data several years ago. Yahoo confirmed Wednesday that it was notifying users that their accounts had potentially been compromised but declined to say how many people were affected. In a statement, Yahoo tied some of the potential compromises to what it has described as the \"state-sponsored actor\" responsible for the theft of private data from more than 1 billion user accounts in 2013 and 2014. The stolen data included email addresses, birth dates and answers to security questions.

Are we, he asks, \"building the world we all want?\"\nWhile most people now use Facebook to connect with friends and family, Zuckerberg hopes that the social network can encourage more civic engagement, an informed public and community support in the years to come. Facebook now has nearly 2 billion members, which makes it larger than any nation in the world.\nPopular Searches Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF\n▲ 1,500.00 +100.00 +7.14% Avon Products Inc AVP\n▼ 4.77 -1.09 -18.60% AT&T Inc T\n▲ 41.25 +0.13 +0.32% Apple Inc AAPL\n▼ 135.35 -0.17 -0.12% His 5,800-word essay positions Facebook in direct opposition to a rising tide of isolationism and fear of outsiders, both in the U.S. and abroad. In a phone interview with The Associated Press, Zuckerberg stressed that he wasn't motivated by the U.S. election or any other particular event. Rather, he said, it's the growing sentiment in many parts of the world that \"connecting the world\" — the founding idea behind Facebook — is no longer a good thing.\n\"Across the world there are people left behind by globalization, and movements for withdrawing from global connection,\" Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in a Harvard dorm room in 2004, wrote on Thursday. \"In times like these, the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us.\"\nZuckerberg, 32, said he still strongly believes that more connectedness is the right direction for the world. But, he adds, it's \"not enough if it's good for some people but it's doesn't work for other people. We really have to bring everyone along.\"\nCOMMUNITY SUPPORT\nThe letter is short on specific details and plans Facebook has in the works. And it doesn't mention anything about Facebook as a business, its billions in advertising revenue or the targeting it is often criticized for. Zuckerberg said Facebook provides regular updates on how its business is doing and product launches —and this is meant to be different.\nToday, most of Facebook's 1.86 billion members — about 85 percent — live outside of the U.S. and Canada. The Menlo Park, California-based company has offices everywhere from Amsterdam to Jakarta to Tel Aviv. (It is banned in China, the world's most populous country, though some people get around it.) Naturally, Zuckerberg takes a global view of Facebook and sees potential that goes beyond borders, cities and nations.\nAnd that could allow the social network to step up as more traditional cultural ties fray. People already use Facebook to connect with strangers who have the same rare disease, to post political diatribes, to share news links (and sometimes fake news links ). Facebook has also pushed its users to register to vote, to donate to causes, to mark themselves safe after natural disasters, and to \" go live .\" For many, it's become a utility. Some 1.23 billion people use it daily.\nFacebook groups, which allow people to come together based on shared interests, could play a bigger role in this respect, Zuckerberg suggests. In groups, people talk about everything from knitting to parenting to political activism . More than 100 million people are in at least one Facebook group, though Zuckerberg wants way more. He laments the fading of traditional social communities such as churches, labor unions and local groups.\n\"A healthy society needs these communities to support our personal, emotional and spiritual needs,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"In a world where this physical social infrastructure has been declining, we have a real opportunity to help strengthen these communities and the social fabric of our society.\"\n© The Associated Press FILE - In this Nov. 19, 2016 file photo, Mark Zuckerberg, chairman and CEO of Facebook, waves at the CEO summit during the annual Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Lima, Peru. Zuckerberg released a missive Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017, outlining his vision for the social network and the world at large. Among other things, Zuckerberg hopes that the social network can encourage more civic engagement, an informed public and community support in the years to come. (AP Photo/Esteban Felix, File) LONG VIEW\nZuckerberg has gotten Facebook to this position of global dominance — one that Myspace and Twitter, for instance, never even approached — partly thanks to his audacious, long-term view of the company and its place in the world.\nRather than getting fixated on the next quarter's profit or the next day's user uproar, he tends to consider Facebook 5, 10 or more years into the future. It's as grandiose as it's been successful, at least so far.\n\"For the past decade, Facebook has focused on connecting friends and families. With that foundation, our next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community — for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for inclusion of all,\" he wrote.\nLast fall, Zuckerberg and his wife, the doctor Priscilla Chan, unveiled the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative , a long-term effort aimed at eradicating all disease by the end of this century. Then, as now, Zuckerberg preferred to look far down the road to the potential of scientific and technological innovations that have not been perfected, or even invented yet. This includes artificial intelligence.\n\"The long term promise of AI is that in addition to identifying risks more quickly and accurately than would have already happened, it may also identify risks that nobody would have flagged at all — including terrorists planning attacks using private channels, people bullying someone too afraid to report it themselves, and other issues both local and global,\" he wrote. \"It will take many years to develop these systems.\"\nSpeaking to the AP, Zuckerberg said he understands that we might not \"solve all the issues that we want\" in the short term.\n\"One of my favorite Quote: s is this Bill Gates Quote: , that 'people overestimate what they can get done in two years and underestimate what they can get done in 10 years.' And that's an important mindset that I hope more people take today,\" he said.\nReach Barbara Ortutay on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BarbaraOrtutay\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BarbaraOrtutay", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f00%2fen-us%2fAAmxUkm&lang=en-us&flow_id=4c15af39-ba56-4309-ab7c-880c27f4961a", "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c936cd4f89744a41a4b1ac274f20bba1/protests-pussy-hats-trump-resistance-brews-online", "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/544542cd55a34ff5a0a234287217edfb/facebook-boosts-efforts-do-good-new-tools", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f00%2fen-us%2fAAmxUkm%3focid%3dst&text=Mark+Zuckerberg+promises+more+community+on+Facebook&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f00%2fen-us%2fAAmxUkm%3focid%3dst", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmxUkm?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "http://api.gannett-cdn.com/Syndication/v5/assets/search?sc=msn-z5bfqkuatkp663x2kugs9b3f&cs=usat&format=json&fulltext=true&fq=assettypename:text&apiKey=z5bfqkuatkp663x2kugs9b3f&fq=section:tech&count=50&fq=-authoringtypecode:promo&includeTimezoneOffset=true&quot;}", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmxUkm?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;102&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmxUkm?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA3ltd8.img", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/201702/1386/29906170001_5307856533001_5307843033001.mp4&quot;,&quot;shareUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/02/02/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-groups-community/97371788/&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;USA", "http://ap.org/", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmxSdP.img&quot;}}", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmxUkm?blobrefkey=101&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;180&quot;}", "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/why-facebook-keeps-pushing-you-go-live-video", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/2e8bd422-327a-4a33-b1ea-434bd59e8aef/4f9e2155-e491-4ac8-bfe4-6a6004b61b92.ism&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1006&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/2e8bd422-327a-4a33-b1ea-434bd59e8aef/4f9e2155-e491-4ac8-bfe4-6a6004b61b92.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;htt", "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/22e0809d20264498bece040e85b96935/facebook-takes-fake-news", "https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-global-community/10154544292806634", "http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/BBktwuo.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Mark", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxEP.img", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBhb5Hu.img", "http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/95af590f71cf4392b3b054ecc0254c4a/zuckerbergs-have-new-charitable-goal-end-all-disease", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f00%2fen-us%2fAAmxUkm%3focid%3dsl&title=Mark+Zuckerberg+promises+more+community+on+Facebook&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f00%2fen-us%2fAAmxUkm%3focid%3dsl"], "published": "2017-02-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:19:11.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
