All their films as an actor-director duo have been highly appreciated by critics and their fans. Two of Shahid's path breaking movies, Kaminey and Haider , were with Vishal Bhardwaj and this clearly speaks volumes about their creative partnership. \nThis time too, Sasha has collaborated with Vishal Bhardwaj for the third time in Rangoon. Speaking with a leading daily, Shahid revealed how they have developed a dynamic relationship over the years. \nYouTube Screengrab \nShahid spoke about how he has a lot of respect for the director and feels he will never be able to say no to Vishal. He was quoted saying, \"Vishal sir always bounces off ideas to me and then we discuss. He narrates the script, dialogues, and talks about music. So it's like a process of sharing and it's like 'what do you think?' We have a candid relationship.\" \nHe added, \nYouTube Screengrab \"It will really take a lot for me to not do a film with him. I would be surprised if he comes to me with something and I would say no to him for a film. I doubt that will happen.\" \nShahid further divulged that Vishal Bhardwaj had mentioned about Rangoon while they were working on Haider, the director's last movie in his Shakespearean trilogy. \nTwitter \"When we were doing 'Haider', he had told me about this film. He wanted me to do it and I was happy that he considered me again. Because a filmmaker of his calibre can get bored of an actor as he has the best (actors) at his disposal. So when he comes back to me I feel very happy and privileged.\" \nRangoon is slated to release on 24th February, 2017.
