Leaving the underside of your chin bare is a recipe for embarrassment. Actually, make that embarrassment times two. \n“It’s an instant double chin,” says Candia. “You could be a string bean, and it will still give you that appearance.” \nWhen you end your beard right at your jaw line, you’ve given yourself what we call the “accidental chinstrap.” This type of beard stayed behind in the ‘90s . And for good reason. When you look down at your phone, it’s like your beard has a beard—made of neck flesh. When you turn your head, your beard turns with it. When you yawn, your chin slides out of your beard and into your neck. \nProblem is, you need to draw the line somewhere. Unless you’re the kind of guy whose beard magically tapers off into his neck (see Brody Jenner below), you’re going to require a neckline. A post shared by Brody Jenner (@brodyjenner) on Jun 1, 2016 at 11:19am PDT \n“If you naturally taper under the neck already, a fade on the neck cleans it up without adding hard lines,” says Candia. “But with a lot of guys, hairier guys, the chest doesn’t separate from the neck hair without shaving.” \nAnd when you’re shaving, even the most well-intentioned neckline can raise your beard up too high. The good news is, once you know this rule of thumb, you’ll never do that again. \nTake your index finger and point to your Adam’s apple. Now slide your finger up to the top of your Adam’s apple, where it meets your neck. Think of it like balancing your finger on top of that little nub of cartilage (or whatever it is). \nFor most guys, including facial hair chameleon Chris Daughtry (below), this is the natural boundary between under-chin and neck. A post shared by Chris Daughtry (@chrisdaughtry) on Jul 19, 2016 at 10:57pm PDT \nNow it’s time to trim along this boundary. When you tip your head back, the neckline should look fairly straight, running from one corner of your jaw to the other. \n“Follow the line around without rounding too much,” says Candia. “It shouldn’t be a V—there should definitely be hair under both sides of the jaw.” \nUse either your normal razor or a small trimmer—the neckline requires neat work. But don’t worry. If you screw it up, it’s fixable. Give your whole beard a short trim, resume shaving where the line should be, and let the boundary area grow back in. A post shared by Aaron Paul (@glassofwhiskey) on Sep 2, 2016 at 4:24pm PDT \nA beard generally grows about a half an inch a month, but thanks to the contrast with your bare neck, even a couple weeks’ growth makes an impact. Relax. Breathe. Your under-chin will look like Aaron Paul’s (above) in no time.
