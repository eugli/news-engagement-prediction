The source recently shared a render depicting what he claims is Verizon’s Moto G5 Plus, which doesn’t seem to be too different from the non-carrier variant spotted in some of the previously leaked images. \nWhile the source claims that the render above shows the Moto G5 Plus for Verizon, the device appears to be free of Verizon’s ubiquitous branding. In any case, we can safely assume that Verizon’s Moto G5 Plus will share roughly the same hardware characteristics as the international variant of the device, meaning that it should accommodate a 5.2-inch display with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels, as well as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 System-on-Chip housing eight ARM Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 2.0GHz, along with the Adreno 506 graphics chip and 2GB of RAM. Previous leaks and rumors reveal that the handset’s circular camera housing will accommodate a 12-megapixel rear-facing sensor complete with a dual-LED flash, while a 5-megapixel camera for selfies and video calls will sit on the opposite side. The Moto G5 Plus will allegedly feature 64GB of internal storage, presumably expandable through a microSD card slot. Other features worth mentioning include a 3,000 mAh battery with TurboPower charging support, as well as Android 7.0 Nougat which is running out of the box. Finally, the Moto G5 Plus weighs 155 grams and features a metal body that’s 150.2 x 72 x 7.9mm in size. \nIt remains to be seen when Verizon Wireless intends to release the Moto G5 Plus, but it’s possible that won’t happen before the international variant hits the market. The smartphone should be officially unveiled at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Spain, which will open its doors to the public on February 27. The Moto G5 Plus should also be accompanied by a budget-friendlier alternative called simply the Moto G5, but there’s still no word on whether the aforementioned variant will also be sold by Verizon.
