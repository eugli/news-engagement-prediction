Old Hollywood’s biggest stars weren’t just figures on posters and the silver screen for Prince Albert II of Monaco; they were in his childhood home. Albert, whose parents were Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier III, recalled his childhood interactions with some of the biggest A-listers in an interview and rare tour of the palace with CBS Sunday Morning ’s Rita Braver. Some of Hollywood’s biggest players star in Albert’s childhood memories, he told Braver. Gregory Peck, Alfred Hitchcock, Frank Sinatra, Kirk Douglas and Cary Grant were all regular guests of Kelly at the palace. Some of this bunch could get quite rowdy—at least in their humor—but the princess’s only son doesn’t appear to have been shielded from any of it. ” [Cary Grant] and my father used to have a field day telling jokes!” the prince said, remembering the legendary actor, who often worked blue. Albert seems to be particularly fond of his memories of Grant. In an October 2014 interview with People , he recalled that Grant would even share some of his dirty humor with Kelly’s children but, of course, saved “the dirtier [jokes]” for their father. Although his living room could sometimes resemble an Oscars red carpet, Albert told Braver that his childhood was a relatively normal one. He watched his mother, who, as Braver reports, quit work in the film industry to raise children, live selflessly. “She was a very loving and caring mother,” he said. “And she not only made sure that she gave us enough attention and enough love and that we had everything we needed, but she was so caring toward other people, too.” After Kelly died in a car accident in 1982, Prince Rainier started the Princess Grace Foundation—USA , a nonprofit dedicated to “identifying and assisting emerging talent in theater, dance, and film by awarding grants in the form of scholarships, apprenticeships, and fellowships,” according to its Web site. Last October, Hamilton ’s Leslie Odom Jr. was the recipient of the annual Princess Grace Statue Award. \"So, if some little kid sees that image of us holding our Tony awards or holding our Princess Grace award, it gives them the willingness to dream for themselves, then that is a beautiful thing,\" Odom said. The Eternal Style of Grace Kelly Amazing Grace Grace Kelly holding her Oscar the night she won best actress for The Country Girl at the 27th Annual Academy Awards, in 1955. Kelly’s performance as the long-suffering wife of an alcoholic (Bing Crosby) beat out the category’s front-runner, Judy Garland, for A Star Is Born. \nFrom the Everett Collection/Rex Features/courtesy of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Nights in Green Satin At the ceremony, Kelly wore a sea-foam satin gown by Edith Head, an Oscar-winning costume designer. Not captured in our slide show are the matching coat and the two yellow roses Kelly tucked into her loose chignon. She had worn the same outfit to the film’s premiere months earlier, a sensible recycling of outfits that would be inconceivable today. \nCourtesy of the Consulate General of Monaco, New York. Glory Be to Grace A month before her big Oscar win, the Philadelphia Museum of Art awarded singer Marian Anderson, Kelly, and conductor Eugene Ormandy (to Kelly’s left) special distinctions for “giving glory to the arts.” Again, Kelly adorned herself with fresh flowers, this time in a corsage of orchids. \nFrom Rue des Archives/the Granger Collection, New York. Pure Confection It’s unfortunate that the designer of the Philadelphia dress is unknown; whoever dreamed up this lace number clearly ranks among the era’s greatest costumers, with Head and Helen Rose. Though the pattern here is intricate, the cut is simple and straightforward in Kelly’s characteristically elegant way. \nCourtesy of the Consulate General of Monaco, New York. Presidential Company What a meeting of style and substance! The Prince and Princess took a little lunch at the White House in 1961, the same year Kelly was inducted into the International Best-Dressed Hall of Fame and Jacqueline Kennedy debuted on the annual list. \nFrom Bettmann/Corbis. Fit to Be Tied Hubert de Givenchy reigned supreme at the time, dressing women such as Kelly, Jacqueline Kennedy, and Audrey Hepburn in his couture. This, well, Kelly-green wool shift was appropriate for a stately daytime affair with the president and First Lady. \nCourtesy of the Consulate General of Monaco, New York. Earth Angel The cover of “ Grace Kelly Style ” features Kelly in an Oleg Cassini dress that she wore at a shoot for Cosmopolitan . Before she met Prince Rainier, Kelly was briefly engaged to Cassini, who helped develop the flattering cuts and styles that would come to be known as her style. \n© The Estate of Erwin Bluemfeld, 2009/courtesy of the Victoria and Albert Museum.
