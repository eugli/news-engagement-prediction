(Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) \nHESPERIA (CBSLA.com) — A man trying to save his dog after it fell into the California Aqueduct died Wednesday after falling in himself, authorities said. \nLucas Hermenegildo, 58, of Victorville was pulled from the water unresponsive after falling in the aqueduct, between Highway 395 and the I-15 Freeway, just before 1 p.m. \nHermenegildo was taken to a hospital, where he was later pronounced dead, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. \nInvestigators determined that Hermenegildo and his wife were walking their dogs along the aqueduct when one of the dogs fell in the water. Hermenegildo then fell in while reaching into the water to save his dog, authorities said. \nEmergency personnel estimated he was in the water for about 10 to 15 minutes before being pulled out. Authorities did not say how Hermenegildo died. \nThe dog was able to get out of the water and was not injured. \nSheriff’s officials say that although the water on the surface of the aqueduct appears calm and slow moving, there is an undertow that can quickly pull a person under, so pedestrians should maintain distance from the edge while walking along the aqueduct.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:02:20.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
