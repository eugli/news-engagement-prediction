The Habs' recent results weren't pretty, and in-season firings have sparked positive change \nA tumultuous stretch shouldn't always prompt an immediate and drastic coaching change like the swap of Therrien for Julien, but the simple truth is that Montreal was sputtering at a crucial point in the season, having won just one of its last seven games. And elsewhere, like in Boston, where Bruce Cassidy has the Bruins on a 3-0 roll since replacing Julien, the winds of change have inspired some passionate hockey. 2. Montreal has been trending downward for awhile \nYes, the Canadiens are still right in the hunt for a prime playoff spot . And, yes, their struggles have been magnified of late thanks to a porous seven-game stretch. But the season-long numbers tell a broader picture of Therrien's unit, which dipped below .500 after an incredible 13-1-1 start to the year. So as much as the move to bring back Julien is something along the lines of a spur-of-the-moment leap toward what the Habs hope is a positively fresh voice running the show, this turnover is also, in a way, a half of a season in the making. Claude Julien again will be behind the bench with the Habs, like he was here in 2005. Getty Images 3. Julien might be the perfect recipe for a rebound \nWho could have predicted a week ago, when Julien was dropped from his Boston post after more than a decade with the team, that the Habs would soon be welcoming their old coach with open arms? If only for the pure spectacle and story of an improbable reunion, the return of Julien marks an intriguing turn for this Montreal club in desperate need of a win streak. And it just might be the right kind of reunion, at least in part because of Julien's history in Montreal and respect within the organization.
