When you go to vote on a piece of music -- at least the way that I approach it -- is you almost put a blindfold on and you listen. It's a matter of what you react to and what in your mind as a professional really rises to the highest level of excellence in any given year. And that is going to be very subjective\". \nAsked whether the diversity of the Recording Academy membership needs to be improved, as per the Oscars after the #OscarsSoWhite scandal, Portnow says, \"Well, they may have had a problem. We don't have that kind of an issue in that same fashion\". i-D couldn't locate diversity figures for the Recording Academy membership on the Grammys website, and an email to the communications team was returned as 'undeliverable'. \nPortnow concedes in the interview that the Academy is \"always working on increase diversity in membership, whether it's ethnicity, gender, genre, or age,\" explaining that, \"In order to maintain our relevance, we have to be refreshing all the time and we have to be doing that across the board\". Elsewhere, he downplays the awards ceremony no-shows by Kanye, Drake and Frank Ocean, saying \"They're all different situations. Not everybody comes to the Grammys every year\".
