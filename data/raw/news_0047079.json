It recently signed on a large franchisee for food retail in West Asia as well as a nuclear power producer in the United States to provide its software. \n\n\"We decided to get into this as we can get global clients to sign up on the platform, which is free for 15 days and is a paid offering following that. We have seen multiple sign-ups within 24 hours of opening up the platform, with majority of requests coming in from retail, FMCG and traditional sectors,\" said LogiNext CEO Dhruvil Sanghvi. \n\nThe SaaS model, which is opened for registration across 100 countries, is yet to be launched in India, where LogiNext works with clients such as Myntra , Unilever , Coca Cola and Suzuki on an offline basis. \n\n\"We launched in other markets first as the self-service model works best outside of India. We have also uploaded video and other guides online for the companies to understand the tools on our platform,\" Sanghvi said. \n\nThe company has set up sales offices in Dubai and the US to tap into clients in these markets. The software platform costs up to $100,000 per annum for some of the larger clients.
