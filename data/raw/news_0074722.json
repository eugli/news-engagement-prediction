Nothing will change that: not a loss of soul, or three-figure ticket prices, or even a slightly naff acronym-based name. Yep, it’s EFL Cup final day! \nFor Manchester United and Southampton, there are reasons to be veru excited. Southampton hope to win only the second major trophy in their history and the first since Bobby Stokes’ clearly onside/palpably offside/hilariously offside (delete as appropriate) goal beat United in the 1976 FA Cup final. United are starting to resemble a serious team again under Jose Mourinho and there is good reason to think that, if they win today, it will be the first of many trophies over the next 10 years, maybe even the next 10 weeks. The League Cup is to Mourinho what the Anglo-Scottish Cup was to Brian Clough . \nThe game isn’t easy to call. United are favourites - duh - but Southampton have dumped out eliminated Arsenal and Liverpool and have a menacing, nippy front three. Against that, their weakened defence has to cope with Pogba, Ibrahimovic, Mata and Martial. They need an acronym of their own. Anyone for Pimm’s? \nKick off is at 4.30pm. Manchester United v Southampton: expected line-ups for the final.
