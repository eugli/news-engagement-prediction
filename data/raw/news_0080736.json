The singer, who's pregnant with her second child , chooses daring outfits — like a blazer top with a plunging neckline — for red carpet events and has a sexy footwear collection to match. Just because this mama's expecting doesn't mean she'll forgo her signature style, and that's what we love about her. However, you'll also likely spot Ciara in a pair of sneakers and cozy PJs, especially when she's hanging out with her son, Future, or in this case, wearing matching maternity outfits with a friend.
