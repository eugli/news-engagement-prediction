Trawl measurements are calculated from GPS points, so the actual area of seabed contacted within those points is estimated. Nevertheless, it is the best information available to our scientists. \nThat's not all the seabed disturbance outlined in Our Marine Environment. From 1990 to 2014, there were also 881,270 dredge tows for oysters, and 1,988,640 tows for scallops. \nSo why, you may ask, should we care? We have a billion-dollar fishing industry and a quota management system recognised as world-leading. \nWe should care because habitat damage is not a good idea, whether it is in the Amazon or in our coastal waters. Healthy and intact habitats are fundamental to sustainability. \nLoss of habitat reduces the abundance of species. Repeated disturbance prevents recovery of ecological communities and disrupts key ecosystem functions. Sediment gets kicked up into the water column, which reduces algal photosynthesis and productivity of marine ecosystems. \nKiwis recognise these negative ecological modifications, along with overfishing, through the well-documented decline in local fisheries that has happened in the space of two or three generations. \nIt should be noted here that some of our seafloor habitats are likely to be more resilient than others to repeated disturbance, and damage to others will be patchy. \nSome are fragile, such as the soft sediment habitat in the photo below, taken by biologist Rob Davidson off d'Urville Island, in a survey of significant marine sites for Marlborough District Council. \nThese habitats host a profusion of sea life â€“ including marine plants, invertebrates, and fish. They can be thought of as ecological 'banks' - reservoirs of biodiversity - which require protection. \nOne pass of heavy trawl doors will obliterate much of this habitat created by living organisms, and recovery may take many decades if left undisturbed, should it be able to recover at all. \nThere are sizeable benthic protected areas in the deep ocean. However, in coastal waters, such as the Marlborough Sounds, there are very few areas that are legally protected from commercial and recreational seafloor disturbance. The habitats that remain are therefore vitally important. \nMarlborough District Council has prohibited dredging and seabed-trawling at a small number of known ecologically significant sites in its new Environment Plan. These sites cover a tiny fraction of the 7,250 km2 of Marlborough's coastal waters managed under the Resource Management Act 1991. \nThere are likely to be more sites of rare beauty and diversity of life that are yet to be discovered. These may well only be postage stamp in size, like forest remnants. But they may well be vulnerable because of the intensity of repeated seafloor disturbance around the coastline. \nA NIWA report for the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) looked at trawling intensity between 2008 and 2012 and found more than 1,000,000 km of seafloor is criss-crossed each year for terakihi, snapper, gurnard and flatfish. \nThe effects on the seafloor in different areas will vary depending on a range of factors, but the overall impression from maps in the report is of a ploughed aquatic paddock surrounding most of our coastline. \nMPI is considering the use of innovative trawl technologies in its Future of our Fisheries Review. This links to one of the aims of the Government's new Biodiversity Action Plan 2016-2020 , which aims to make progress towards managing the impacts of trawling and dredging on the seabed. \nHere in Marlborough we have a role to play, as the Environment Court recently confirmed the Resource Management Act requires regional councils to protect important seabed habitats. \nThis may open the way for innovative partnerships between councils, MPI, DOC, iwi, industry and communities to work together to manage coastal waters in a much more sustainable way. \nA recent quote from Sir David Attenborough supports this: \n\"There has never been a time in history when the natural environment has been under greater threat than it is now and therefore the need for new ideas and innovation to combat the destruction of nature upon which we all depend for the future.\" \nIt is only by working together that we have the best chance of protecting and restoring our seabed biodiversity. \nDr Steve Urlich is coastal scientist for Marlborough District Council", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:28:35.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
