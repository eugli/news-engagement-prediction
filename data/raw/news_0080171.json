READ MORE Refugee children given opportunity to learn again through Intensive English Centres After being out of the classroom for years, refugee children are relishing the chance to learn at Intensive English Centres. \nEchoing this is the Forum of Australian Services for Survivors of Torture and Trauma, or FASSTT, which works with people fleeing dangerous or risky situations in their home countries. \nNational coordinator Paula Peterson, and CEO of FASSTT's Queensland arm, Tracy Worrall, say education is particularly important in keeping young people \nDiscrimination and isolation from non-migrant peers can see many youths withdraw, and gravitate towards certain groups. \n“When a group feels alienated they will naturally be drawn to peers where they feel comfortable and accepted and safe, and not judged,” they said. \nAnd if they don’t “feel part of the community that they've joined then this is always going to be a risk.\" \nBut they’re quick to point out that this is not a problem unique to migrant communities. \n“I think you could look at any group of young people in a whole range of different environments in Australia and see similar issues,” such as social disadvantage, they said. READ MORE Regional community disappointed by government's rejection as resettlement location Leaders in the NSW regional town of Armidale say the government has missed an opportunity for the development of their community after its application to be a refugee resettlement location was rejected. \nThe inquiry has a focus on youth gang activity, something Dr Ahmed says has been unfairly associated with the African community. \n“We are at the bottom of the ladder and we are judged wrongly,” he said. \nDr Ahmed believes African migrants are not “crime-infested” people, but instead are being demonised by a few repeat offenders. \n“We are just labelled for any crime that happens as if we are the only people that are bringing crime (here),” he said. \nOther issues raised include the level of English language classes, intergenerational trauma and a lack of cultural sensitivity. SBS RADIO Concern for elder migrants as services move online SBS World News Radio: Ethnic groups have raised concerns that some migrants are missing out on important government information because of a lack of digital literacy. \nJesuit Social Services CEO, Julie Edwards, says migration must not be treated as a one-off event, but as a continuous journey that needs long-term support. \n“We've seen so many people make a contribution to this country, but we need to invest in them,” she said, which means extending services beyond five and maybe even 10 years. \nAll groups say they would like to see real change made by the inquiry. \nFASSTT's Paula Peterson has warned against services and organisations using a one-size-fits-all approach for migrant communities. \nShe says there is no “magical formula which you can apply to a prospective migrant or refugee coming to Australia and be able to ascertain their likelihood of settling well.” \nMs Peterson says a person feeling like they belong to a community is the most important thing, and “I think there are lots of things we can do to enhance that.\" READ MORE Fresh STARTTS: Helping refugees overcome trauma and embrace safety The path to Australia is rocky for many who come as refugees or asylum seekers , and trauma can stay long after they arrive.
