Photo: AP \nWhile Aldi has been criticised for keeping its financial accounts secret , it has been praised for lowering grocery prices in Australia and has gained a large following online for its prices and quirky specials. \nAldi aims to be 20 to 25 per cent cheaper on a basket of groceries than rivals Woolworths and Coles. It does so by selling almost only high-margin home-brand products and through greater labour productivity – not selling many products, and not having many staff. \nAdvertising executive Adam Ferrier said brands were \"trying to get the voice of the consumer into the heart of how their business operates\" and the testers' club was a \"fantastic strategy\". \n\"In psychology there is something called the Hawthorne effect, which is people will become positively predisposed [to something] purely by having their opinions asked,\" said Mr Ferrier, who is the global chief strategy officer/consumer psychologist at Cummins&Partners. \n\"So everybody in the testers' club will become more predisposed to Aldi and are more likely to promote it to friends and family and online.\" \nMr Ferrier said letting customers in on the production process also gave them more of a sense of ownership about the company. \n\"Another effect is the Ikea effect, which means if you ​complete an Ikea bookcase as opposed to just receiving it, you put a 30 per cent premium on that because you've put effort into it,\" he said. \nIn addition, the recommendations of \"people like us\" were more credible than those of celebrities, he said. \nFinally, those 100 testers would become \"even more devoted\" to Aldi after their involvement to rationalise their time investment, he said. \nAustralia's biggest supermarkets, Woolworths and Coles, have different methods for testing their products. \nCustomers tests Woolworths' homebrand products at the company's \"Food Innovators Centre\" in Sydney before they hit the supermarket shelves. \n\"At the centre, products go through the total food development journey, from creation, testing and sensory experiences. At each stage we ensure our customers and their feedback are an essential part of the product development journey,\" a Woolworths spokesman said. \nColes did not answer whether it had a testing club, but said \"feedback is very important to Coles and we proactively communicate with our customers about our products via a number of channels such as Tell Coles, Coles Circle, Flybuys and our Customer Care team\". \nSteve Kulmar, owner of retail consultancy RetailOasis, said Woolworths and Coles had plenty of data on the people who shopped with them but not enough retailers in Australia used panels of people. \n\"It gets you close to your best and most frequent users and really tells you what they're liking and not liking,\" he said. \"It's a good start but it's not the whole picture [in that it excludes] the people who don't shop with you.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:09:24.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
