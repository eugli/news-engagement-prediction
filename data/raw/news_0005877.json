But Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is already pressuring his leadership to call off the chamber's breaks in order to get President Donald Trump’s nominee confirmed. In a brief interview with POLITICO on Tuesday, Grassley was asked about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s desired timeline to install Trump’s pick for the high court, who is set to be unveiled Tuesday night. McConnell said in a POLITICO interview last week that he would like the nominee confirmed by the Easter recess.\n“I can’t speak for Senator McConnell, but he told you the way it should be set,” Grassley said. “And he ought to be prepared to cancel the Easter recess if it can’t be done by then.”\nThe Easter recess is scheduled for the weeks of April 10 and April 17.\nGrassley, who will be at the epicenter of the Supreme Court fight as the powerful committee’s chairman, laid out his own timetable to consider Trump’s nominee. He said the committee will enlist more legal experts to examine all the opinions written by the nominee and do research, a process that will take about 35 to 40 days. During that time, the nominee will also be doing courtesy meet-and-greets with senators, particularly the 20 who sit on the committee.\nThat would put the Supreme Court nomination hearings around mid-March, Grassley said. That schedule tracks closely with how long the committee has taken for previous nominees, he said.\n“It’ll follow pretty much what is already practice, maybe over the last 20 years,” the Iowa Republican said. “I want anybody that’s interested in this that’s reading your story that we’re going to try to do it of the precedent of previous [nominees] as far as time is concerned.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:17:29.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
