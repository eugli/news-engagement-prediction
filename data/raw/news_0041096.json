(Photo: Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports) 12 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMiami Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria reportedly could sell the team, and if he does, it looks like he won't be bored without his baseball club. \nThe New York Post reported Wednesday that the 76-year-old art dealer is under consideration for a role in the Trump administration as U.S. ambassador to France. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus is lobbying for Loria to land the post, per the report. \nLoria has been linked to President Donald Trump in another way recently. Marlins mum on potential sale, but suitors lurk - including Trump connection \nThe New York Times reported last week that Loria is in talks to sell the baseball club to a group that includes Joshua Kushner, the brother of Jared Kushner. Jared, of course, is married to Ivanka Trump and also serves as the President's top adviser. \nBut that's not all. \nLoria, along with his wife, Julie, donated $250,000 to the Trump PAC during the campaign. \nGallery: Best pictures from Spring Training Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:02:13.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
