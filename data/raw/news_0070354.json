Starring Rahul of 'Happy Days' as a Pizza delivery boy and debutante Mahima Makhwana, the thriller is directed by Venu Madikanti. With the trailer holding back information, with Rahul looking suspicious, all that we can be certain for now is that the youngster has happily undergone a makeover. Achu has \"nailed\" the BGM. Sai Prakash's cinematography seems to be a major highlight. The film also features Kashi Vishwanath, Ajay, Jogi Brothers, Anitha in key roles. Funded jointly by Shreyas Srinivas Rao and Tumu Phani Kumar, it is currently in post-production stage and is set to hit the screens very soon. Director Venu Madikanti himself has written the movie. It has art direction by J Mohan. The lyrics are written by Anath Sriram and Vanamali.
