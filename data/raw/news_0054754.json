At this point I put the book down to apply some cologne — not my signature Beige, but my pretty summer plaything, Jo Malone’s Wild Bluebell — in case I would no longer feel able to use it by the end of the book.

Natalie Corner of DailyMail.co.uk explains the creation process of Dior Parfums in light of the new documentary Inside Dior on the UK's Channel 4 : It's not just Christian Dior's dazzling couture gowns that are the result of thousands of hours of skilled craftsmanship and precise attention to detail. It turns out the process behind the historic fashion house's successful fragrances is equally laborious - and expensive. Previously shrouded in secrecy, a new documentary reveals the impressive lengths Dior goes to to perfect its perfumes - including the 1,400 man hours devoted to hand-picking seven million full jasmine blooms from its fields in Grasse, in the South of France. READ MORE... Corner goes on to offer some interesting facts about Dior fragrances and highlights an interview with perfumer Francois Demachy. Are you a Dior fragrance fan? What's your favorite? Jessica Kozuka at RocketNews24.com announced this week the launch of a new Japanese fragrance brand, J-Scent . For example: Roasted Green Tea, or hojicha, in Japanese, is a very popular beverage and is served both hot and cold. It has a warming, earthy scent, especially as the leaves are being roasted. According to the manufacturer, this perfume recalls that and “the feeling of having a chat with an intimate friend.” Wasanbon is an expensive fine-grained sugar produced in the south of Japan from sugarcane. It is primarily used in making wagashi , or traditional Japanese sweets. I can’t say that there is any particular smell associated with it, but the product description says it’s “a friendly scent with the image of delicate wagashi.” READ MORE... Having lived in Japan for a number of years, I'm definitely curious about any scent that can purport to capture the aromas of my old home. What kinds of Japanese scents would you most like to wear/sniff? ScienceDaily.com reported the results of a recent research project from Rockefeller University that examined the range of human olfaction: To get the data they needed, they asked volunteers to sniff a carefully curated set of molecules, each contained in a little vial. The possibilities were nearly endless -- while the limits on human perception of light and sound are well known, no such boundaries have been established for odor. So in an effort to explore the full range of our sense of smell, Keller assembled a diverse cast of 476 molecules, many of which had never been tested in smell studies before. While not yet perfect, the smell prediction model opens new possibilities for perfume chemists looking for more efficient ways to formulate, say, the perfect scent of dusky rose. It also shines new light on the immensely complex biology of smell perception. No one fully understands what happens when odor molecules waft into the nose and are converted into electrical signals that travel to the brain. READ MORE... I'm always excited about research in aroma and olfaction, and I would have loved to have been part of that study! What other kinds of studies do you think would benefit the fragrance world? But wait! There's more to this study: JP Buntinx at TheMerkle.com revealed that the data from the Rockefeller study could help scientists to develop a sense of smell for artificial intelligence: It is evident that artificial intelligence is evolving at an accelerated pace as of late. Scientists have created a new set of algorithms that would allow AIs to determine the odor of particular molecules based on their chemical structure. In the future, this technology can aid food producers and fragrance makers to create new odors with that “perfect scent”.... Based on over 1 million data points, scientists went to work to create a new AI algorithm. Based on these findings, it is now possible for artificial intelligent beings to differentiate between different smells. To be more precise, AI-based solutions can define scents based on the chemical structure of individual molecules. READ MORE... Can I just say, fascinating!?!?! And finally, one last article that I greatly enjoyed and is likely a poignant read for any fragrance lover. Marlene Smith at Reader's Digest discussed an aroma that she strongly associates with \"home\": I think it all started when I was staying at my mom’s house in North Carolina. A tiny white lilac shrub bloomed along the grassy space separating Mom’s driveway from her neighbor’s. I remember seeing that shrub and realizing just how long it had been since I last saw one. I walked over to it and breathed deeply. A hidden longing came over me. As a youngster growing up in New York, I knew two lilacs. One grew right outside our house; it was a mixture of purple and white branches. I’m told Dad had planted one of each, and they had grown intertwined over the years. The other was more maroon-colored, growing next to an old house that was falling down beside the barn where we milked cows. Isn’t it funny how we can latch onto something, and then it takes on a new importance in our minds? That’s what happened with the lilacs and me. That little shrub at Mom’s made me long for my own lilacs. READ MORE... This of course made me consider what the scent of home is for me. And you know what? It wasn't easy. I can't think of any specific food, flower, cleaning product, etc that I equate with \"home\". Of course, as a modern day nomad I have many homes and no home at the same time. Strange? How about you? What aromas do you equate with \"home\"? \n\nDr. Marlen Elliot Harrison \nManaging Editor & Columnist \nDr. Marlen Elliot Harrison’s journalism in the fragrance industry has appeared in international print and online publications such as Playboy , Men’s Journal , Men’s Health and the New York Times .
