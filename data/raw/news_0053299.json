By Josh Dawsey and Andrew Restuccia 02/22/17 05:07 AM EST \nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao is “getting high marks within the building,” one transportation source said, “but she is frustrated with the White House.” | Getty Print \nThe White House’s deep involvement in hiring decisions across the government is frustrating some of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet secretaries, spurring early tussles between the president’s advisers and leaders of federal agencies. \nWhite House officials have sometimes rejected candidates who have previously criticized the president — even if they boast sterling credentials or have the endorsement of top Republicans. And they’ve often imposed their choices on agencies, according to more than a dozen people inside and close to the administration. Story Continued Below \nMany Cabinet nominees joined the administration believing they’d have wide latitude to pick lieutenants, but they’re beginning to realize Trump’s powerful advisers are looking over their shoulders. The White House’s approach has already slowed hiring — and the dozens of vacancies at key agencies could make it more difficult to implement some of Trump's policy proposals. \nSo far, Trump has nominated fewer than three dozen of the 550 most important Senate-confirmed jobs, according to an analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit group that advised Trump officials during the presidential transition. The Insurgent in the White House By James Kitfield \nTop officials at the Defense and Homeland Security departments have disagreed with White House aides over potential deputy hires and political appointees, administration and government officials say. Some candidates dropped out of the bid for national security adviser because Trump's team appeared reluctant to let them pick their own people, sources say. \nA White House official said it was the Trump administration’s right to hire at agencies across the board. “We won the election because people wanted us to run the government,” this person said. \"We are putting our people in place to do that.\" \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Tuesday that the new choice for national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, has full authority over his hiring and that sources saying other national security adviser candidates didn’t have that opportunity were inaccurate. \nA White House spokesperson said later Tuesday that the hiring process was “collaborative” and that hiring would quicken if Senate Democrats confirmed existing Cabinet nominees. \nExamples of clashes have popped up across the government, according to agency officials, lobbyists and others with knowledge of the process. By Josh Dawsey and Ted Hesson \nWhen an informal adviser to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos recently recommended a candidate for a high-level Senate-confirmed position at the agency, the adviser was told that the candidate had little chance of getting the job because the person had previously worked for an organization that was seen as being at odds with Trump’s policy positions, one person familiar with the issue said. \nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has clashed with White House officials over top officials in his department, sources say. The White House saw some of Mnuchin’s picks as too liberal or not supportive enough of Trump, sources say. Trump has yet to name Mnuchin’s No. 2, nor has he tapped any undersecretaries or assistant secretaries at the department. \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson has struggled with the White House to appoint his own aides, with significant pushback from the White House over deputy positions and ambassadorships. Several high-level people were delayed or scuttled because they didn't agree with Trump during the campaign or because the White House preferred someone else, including Elliott Abrams, who Tillerson wanted to be his No 2. One person said Tillerson “basically has nobody in his agency yet” to fill out the top ranks. \nAt Housing and Urban Development, Shermichael Singleton, a top official, joined the department before being terminated when criticism of Trump surfaced in a final White House review. Singleton was helping HUD nominee Ben Carson plan a national tour after his confirmation and had worked for him for years, a source close to the situation said. Singleton was told by the HUD chief of staff that he would be dismissed because of his comments, the source said, after the comments were flagged to the White House. His last day was last week. The New York Times first reported the Singleton departure. \nHeavily involved in the hiring process has been White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who has told allies he wants his people across the administration, both in the West Wing and the federal agencies. The White House has even signed off on low-level hires at times.
