They don’t worry about the future so much. Indeed, they have a future. Older women should know better but don’t. In the autumn of their years, logic and common sense are among the first things to disappear when they become emotionally involved with a handsome stranger. This week, a single woman in Kent revealed that she went to the police after a man she dated on Tinder turned out to be married. ‘Antony Ray’ had lied to 44-year-old Anna Rowe about his circumstances during their 14-month relationship, which took place almost entirely within the confines of her Canterbury flat. There, she cooked him dinners, had sex with him and allowed him to stay in her home for a couple of days every week. Rent free! What a great deal for the mysterious Mr Ray. It didn’t strike caring Anna as odd that she never met anyone from Antony’s life — she was too busy marinating steaks and lighting mood candles. After she discovered the truth, Anna needed counselling for a year and is now campaigning for lying online to be made illegal. Good luck with that. Breaking a heart is not the same thing as breaking a law. And in many ways she was lucky. Two years ago, a serial rapist who preyed on hundreds of women on dating website Match.com was jailed for at least 12 years. Jason Lawrance, from Hampshire, raped five women he met on the site and sexually assaulted two more. 'Women need to be smarter about romance, to protect themselves and their savings from men who prey on their generosity. And to listen to those inner voices of doubt, even when they are saying something we don’t want to hear' In the midst of all this, in a bizarre twist, he also married a woman he met on a Match.com date. Like Helen Bailey, she was also a widow — heartbroken and looking for companionship after her partner had been killed in a motorcycle accident. To her, Lawrance seemed like a knight in shining armour. But behind her back he was obsessively trawling the profiles of hundreds of other women, and attacking with increasing violence. Online dating and friendship sites are perfectly safe, marvellous inventions and an antidote to the loneliness of the age. Until they are not. And then they become the stuff of nightmares. The lessons we learn from these wretched cases is that the search for love can make fools of us all, so let’s be careful out there. Women need to be smarter about romance, to protect themselves and their savings from men who prey on their generosity. And to listen to those inner voices of doubt, even when they are saying something we don’t want to hear. Of course, none of this could have saved Helen. She couldn’t have known that the man she affectionately called ‘Broad Bean’ harboured a dastardly plan for six years. To those who read her book on grief and bereavement, Stewart was the ‘gorgeous grey-haired widower’ who had helped to piece her life together after the death of her first husband. During all the time they were together, his was the head on the pillow next to hers; theirs was the happiness she thought she would never find again. Yet all along he had not been plotting their future together, but her death — so that he could get his hands on her £4 million estate. All she wanted was a lasting relationship — but in the end she lost everything, including her life. And that really is heartbreaking. Sorry, Kate, you can't match Diana for style The Daily Mail recently published a series of photographs of some of Princess Diana’s most iconic dresses — and an exhibition at Kensington Palace will showcase even more of the clothes she wore at work and at play. Displayed in their glass cases, suspended on invisible wires, the dresses look like ghosts who have returned to haunt the palace in which she once lived. All of this made me think how much Diana is missed. She would often surprise with her fashion choices — she could be dramatic and bold, occasionally making the world gasp at her glamour. She didn’t always get it right, but that just made her even more mesmerising. Once upon a time, she wore spotty ankle socks and woolly jumpers. As she grew in confidence, her style evolved. She was a woman who understood the power of a truly great dress. The Duchess of Cambridge has none of Diana’s megawatt allure, sense of occasion, or willingness to shock through fashion. She often looks wonderful, if slightly boring — like a Home Counties show pony, rather than a star. They are different women from a different age, but still. Sigh. Too much... even for gifted George Elsewhere on the Brits, Andrew Ridgeley paid tribute to ex-Wham! bandmate George Michael. Like everyone else, I think it is sad that George died at such a young age, with so much more to offer the world. But when anyone famous dies these days, all reason is lost in such a thunderbomb of extravagant hype that it slides into meaninglessness. In his short speech, Andrew variously described George as ‘the greatest singer-songwriter of his generation … an icon of his era … a supernova in a firmament of shining stars … an immortal who left a legacy of unquestionable brilliance … transcendental beauty … poetic expression of his soul …’ etc etc. Too much? Perhaps a bit. Even for the man who wrote One More Try and A Different Corner and made us all wonder, now and for ever more, if guilty feet really would have no rhythm. Perspective, please. Save me from a pop star turned politico First it was Trump-hating Hollywood actors wading through a swamp of their personal grief to let us know just how much they hate the new president. And now, it is the turn of pop stars. At the Brit Awards this week, Katy Perry (pictured) politicised her appearance by singing and dancing alongside two giant skeleton puppets dressed as Donald Trump and Theresa May. Radical or wot? During the U.S. election, Katy campaigned for Hillary Clinton, and she is not giving up the fight — now, she wants her music to be known as ‘purposeful pop’. But to what purpose? What indeed was her political statement with the dancing skeletons? That our leaders are going to die? Well, aren’t we all, darling? The most interesting thing about Katy Perry — apart from the fact that she was married to comedian Russell Brand for five minutes — is that her fans spend more on her than any other pop act. According to a study last year by Barclaycard, the ‘KatyCats’ — as her fans like to call themselves — each spend £1,627 a year on their heroine. This breaks down to £311.16 on concert tickets, food and travel, £1,144.30 on merchandise and £171.09 on the actual music itself. That’s a lot of merch, as they say in the biz — but Perry, who is worth an estimated £100 million, is no slouch when it comes to divesting the kiddies of their pocket money. The official Katy Perry website is groaning with items to tempt the KatyCats — £40 T-shirts, £85 jackets, £16 ankle socks, plus the usual pocket patches and baseball caps. If she really wants to empower young women, she should stop preying on their piggy banks in such an avaricious way. Perhaps instead, she should encourage them to stop buying this rubbish and spend the money on books. That would be a purposeful message indeed — but it won’t ever happen. Ker-ching!
