The strong winds combined with the heavy rains could lead to another series of power outages. \nIn higher elevations, many alpine areas will see heavy rain but the snowpack is expected to absorb it; which should minimized flooding, according to Environment Canada. \nAt lower elevations, like the Fraser Valley, flooding could be a concern as melting snow on the ground mixes with the expected rainfall. \nIt’s recommended that residents keep drainage areas free of ice or debris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:50:18.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
