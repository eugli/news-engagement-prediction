But more importantly: watch Donald Trump. \nAs backlash against Mr Trump grows, Mr Brat is one of several Republicans who have found themselves under fire for their support of the Republican president, in a protest movement that some believe is shaping up to become a Tea Party of the left. \nAt town halls across the country, critics of the new president are taking their anger out on their Republican representatives, hooting and hollering, and presenting a road map for activists looking to take anti-Trump resistance movements beyond the initial mass protests of the inauguration weekend. \nFor more than an hour on Tuesday, Mr Brat, a former economics professor, fielded questions on Mr Trump’s travel ban, his ties to Russia and his refusal to release his tax returns as well as broader questions on the environment and healthcare. \nHeckled from start to finish by constituents who booed him and held up red sheets of paper in a sign of disagreement, Mr Brat repeatedly failed to lower the temperature of the room. \n“You’re not being fair to the other people who want to hear,” the congressman complained at one point. \n“You’re not being fair to us either!” a constituent shot back. \nOutside the town hall, scores of other activists held a protest outside the meeting, shouting “This is what democracy looks like!” and waving signs referencing Mr Brat’s nickname “BratWorst” and bearing the slogan “It’s grill time”— a reference to Mr Brat’s recent complaint that female voters were “in [his] grill” about healthcare — a comment caught on audio tape. \n“The Affordable Care Act is a huge concern for me,” Karen Whitacre, a Virginia mother of three, said in an interview, referring to former president Barack Obama’s universal healthcare programme which Mr Trump has vowed to repeal and replace. “We don’t have details. We don’t know what it looks like. We have no idea.” Dave Brat: ‘People are very anxious and nervous after the Trump win. My job is to allay some of those anxieties in the room.’© AFP \nMaureen Hains, a 33-year-old young professional from the Richmond suburbs, said she had voted for Republicans in the past, including George W Bush and John McCain as well Mr Brat himself, but now found herself leading the resistance against him, frustrated that her fiscal conservative views were not being represented by the president or the broader Republican party. \n“If you repeal the Affordable Care Act, people are going to end up in the emergency room and who’s going to pay the bill? The taxpayers,” Ms Hains said, throwing further scorn at Mr Trump’s proposed wall with Mexico, which the Republican Senate estimates will cost up to $15bn. \nMr Brat, a Republican who came to power on the back of the Tea Party movement, won his seat in 2014 after he pulled off a surprise upset against Eric Cantor, then the House majority Speaker, in the district’s Republican primary, a victory that heralded the rise of an anti-establishment wing in Republican congress, and, in some respects, the rise of Mr Trump himself. \nIn an interview, Mr Brat defended his “grill” comment, saying that while he regretted the language, he had only been repeating a phrase used by some of his constituents. “I thought it was funny,” he said. \n“It’s one thing for people to get upset and say, ‘I’m frustrated the election didn’t go the way I wanted’. But on the other hand, we need potential solutions. Give me some ideas,” he said. \n“The Tea Party was fiscal in nature. And over half the energy was aimed at the Republican party on principle,” he said. “What’s the agenda of the left? Name it! It’s crickets. It’s absolute crickets.” \nThe congressman, who was re-elected with 57.5 per cent of the vote last year, is unlikely to lose his seat to a Democratic challenger in 2018. Mr Trump comfortably won the solidly Republican Virginia district by 7 percentage points.

The protesters, she claimed, were finding any issue to complain about —“the toilet didn’t flush”— but in reality their complaints had nothing to do with Mr Brat at all, she said. “They are simply against Donald Trump. They are being stirred up by leftwing extremists.” \nDuring the town hall meeting, Mr Brat attempted to defuse the tension with jokes about his weightlifting and recently published book (“If you’re having a hard time sleeping, you may want to pick it up”). \n“There is a little partisanship going on in the country right now. I’m not sure if you’re aware of it,” he said lightly at one point. \nStill, he acknowledged that some of his constituents’ concerns about the country’s future were real. “I know there is a lot of anxiety on a lot of issues,” he said. \n“People are very anxious and nervous after the Trump win,” he said. “My job is to allay some of those anxieties in the room.” \nAs for Mr Trump, he had his own take on the recent protests. \n“The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists. Sad!” the president tweeted just a few minutes before Mr Brat began speaking on Tuesday evening. Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.
