In fiscal year 2016 meat, dairy, and wine made up around $2.8b of our $5.9b of exports to the country. \nIn the tape, Trump discusses using the threat of overly stringent food safety measures as a cudgel during free trade negotiations. \n\"If you look at Japan, what they do with foodâ€”they say it's not clean enough, and you have to send it back, and by the time it comes back it's all gone,\" Trump said to Ross. \n\"Exactly. And we oughta let them know we're gonna start playing the same game,\" Ross replies. \n\"Well I think you let them know that we're going to do that. Without saying that, you say, \"We're gonna inspect you so closely,\" bomp bomp,\" Trump explains. \nTrade expert and former diplomat Charles Finny said the tape was worrying for Kiwi exporters. \n\"We know that a number of governments around the world use food safety as a cover for protectionist policies,\" he said. \"This is the first time I have heard anyone actually confess to it.\" \n\"It suggests that the US administration will be banning foodstuffs from around the world to protect the US industry.\" \nTrade Minister Todd McClay has been approached for comment. \nAt another part of the leaked tape Trump discussed a 10% tariff on all imported goods to the US. \n\"Obviously that would have major implications for international trade law. The US has legal commitments to tariffs lower than that in many areas. There would be a huge complaint to the World Trade Organisation [WTO] almost immediately,\" Finny said. \nAs the Trans Pacific Partnership has floundered, the US and New Zealand continue to lack a free trade agreement, but Finny said things could get worse. \n\"If things stay exactly as they are now we can still do well in the US market. If they start increasing tariffs there are potential problems.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:02:49.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
