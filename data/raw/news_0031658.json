And boy, we were not disappointed. After being introduced by her mother, Tina Knowles, Beyoncé appeared on-screen in a golden bikini and crown that echoed one of her pregnancy announcement photo shoots, proudly showing off her far-along baby bump pregnant with twins. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s how you do an entrance. Her performance didn’t let up on the symbolism , either. There were references to a goddess, femininity, and motherhood; Madonna-like halos on Blue and Bey and Tina; a long rectangular table that staged an all-female Last Supper; and flower petals covering the stage. As for the songs she chose to perform, Beyoncé went with two tracks she likely hadn't sung live during her awards season circuit: “Love Drought” and “Sandcastles.” Unlike the first half of Lemonade , which features songs about infidelity, jealousy, and anger, these two particular songs deal with forgiveness. An apropos choice indeed, considering she and her husband, Jay Z, are now expecting twins. The emotional performance even brought Jennifer Lopez to her feet. And how could you not be moved? At the very end of the performance, when Beyoncé’s voice is overheard saying, “If we’re gonna heal, let it be glorious,” and a beaming Jay Z is looking up at her, don’t tell us that didn’t choke you up a bit?
