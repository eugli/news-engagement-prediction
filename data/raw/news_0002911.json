These could be virtual voters, non-existent human beings being included in the IEBC register to create room for ballot stuffing during elections.” \nAccording to Raila, the information in opposition possession is that the doctoring exercise is currently being carried out in homes of a senior government official and the office of a former cabinet secretary. \nALSO READ: Jubilee strongholds record highest number of new voters \nIn a statement it said, the numbers above are only a drop in the ocean. The total number of people registered in the IEBC database using different combinations is estimated to be in the thousands. \n“The IEBC must come clean on this matter. But not just that. These developments mean the audit and cleaning of the register is mandatory and has to be extremely thorough.” WATCH THIS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:11:34.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
