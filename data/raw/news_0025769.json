More Givenchy, of course. Stylist Gaelle Paul was inspired by a moment at the 2011 Oscars when her “jaw dropped” at the sight of Cate Blanchett walking onto the stage in the label. “It’s about perfection,” she explains of the approach. “It’s about a moment of elegance and also a fashion statement, but it has to be perfect.” The first dress of the performance was certainly that. Based on the Fall 2016 show, which featured an Egyptian theme, the heavily embellished dress took 1,500 hours and seven artisans to make. Diamond sparklers from Los Angeles–based jeweler XIV Karats added extra wattage, while black velvet pumps kept the look grounded. (“Put your best foot forward,” Paul quipped.) As for Adele’s last look of the night? “It’s an epic outfit,” Paul says. “We accessorized it with the crucifix earrings in homage to George Michael. And we put black diamonds in rings for a darker allure, which this outfit asks for.” The ensemble drew its inspiration from a Givenchy couture piece from the Fall 2012 collection and featured a Western take on Gothic style, melding Victoriana velvet with Americana fringe. Tonight represents the start of a more fashion-forward direction for Adele, who in the past has preferred to make subtle yet sophisticated statements on the carpet and stage. Is this part of a larger goal for Paul? “Fashion goal?” she says with a laugh. “We have an incredible new look for her upcoming tour.” No doubt it will be as successful as her multiplatinum albums.
