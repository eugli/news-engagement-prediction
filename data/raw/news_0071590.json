The BBC say no decision has been made on whether the drama will sail again… but writer Steven Knight has plans for at least two more series     10:00PM \nWarning: Spoilers follow if you have not seen the final episode of Taboo series 1 \nGothic period drama Taboo ended series one in a blaze of gunpowder, with Tom Hardy’s James Delaney – and some of his henchmen and women – making it onto a boat headed for The Azores and flying under the American flag. \nNot everyone was quite as lucky, of course – check here to find out who.

This series is eight parts – it’s a lot of time.\" \nKnight was unavailable for a comment about whether this remains his plan.
