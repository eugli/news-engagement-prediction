Check them out in the gallery below! \nRELATED: Director Otto Bathurst Talks New Robin Hood Movie and Its Social Relevance \nThe cast for the new Robin Hood movie includes Taron Egerton ( Kingsman: The Secret Service , Eddie the Eagle ) as the title hero, with Jamie Foxx ( Django Unchained , Ray ) as Little John, Jamie Dornan ( Fifty Shades of Grey ) as Will Scarlet, Eve Hewson ( Bridge of Spies ) as Maid Marion, Tim Minchin ( Californication ) as Friar Tuck, and Paul Anderson ( Peaky Blinders , The Revenant ) in an undisclosed role. \nDescribed as having a “gritty tone,” the film finds Robin Hood returning from The Crusades to discover a Sherwood Forest rife with corruption and evil. Teaming with a band of outlaws, he takes matters into his own hands to set things right, with very little merry-making along the way. \nBathurst directs from a screenplay by Joby Harold. Robin Hood is produced by Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Davisson Killoran, Basil Iwanyk, Tory Tunnell and Joby Harold. It will arrive in theaters on March 23, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:31:16.208+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
