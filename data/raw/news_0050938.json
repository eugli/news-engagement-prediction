(Hebron)\nBoth projects created thousands of well-paid construction jobs, but that wave has now settled into a deep trough.\nJim Myers said about two-thirds of his union's 1,500 members are now out of work, and they're anxious for the next major project to commence.\nMany are pinning their hopes on the long-awaited West White Rose extension project, which could be sanctioned in the coming months.\nWellhead platform the preferred option Husky Energy is the lead partner on the project, and said this week it is still evaluating its development options.\nThose options include a concrete gravity structure known as a wellhead platform, which is similar in appearance to Hebron and Hibernia, or a subsea drilling centre that would be connected to the SeaRose FPSO.\nThe wellhead platform would be constructed at a specialized graving dock in Placentia, creating hundreds of construction jobs.\nIt's the preferred option of both the provincial government and people like Myers, and sources say it's the most likely outcome.\n\"The timing for Husky is excellent right now. Here we've got a project like Hebron coming to an end. It's going offshore to produce oil similar to Hibernia and be as successful as Hibernia as a project, and on the heels of that Husky is going to build theirs. So they have a work-ready force now to go in and do their project,\" said Myers.\nHebron safety record 'second to none' There's plenty of buzz in the industry that Husky is exploring every option to reduce construction costs, and like Hebron, some key components of the West White Rose projects are expected to be built outside of this province.\nMyers understands that some of the work must be sourced elsewhere, but he believes more can be done in the province.\nMyers said there's one more factor that companies like Husky need to consider â€” the record of safety at Hebron.\n\"It's phenomenal. Second to nowhere in the world. If I were Husky, man I'd want that mantra coming into my work also when I go to do the Argentia project,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:59:24.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
