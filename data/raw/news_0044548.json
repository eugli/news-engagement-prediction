Jacksonville Jaguars defensive end Jared Odrick was released on Monday. (Gail Burton / Associated Press) The Associated Press Privacy Policy \nJACKSONVILLE â€” The Jacksonville Jaguars have released veteran defensive lineman Jared Odrick , saving $8.5 million against the salary cap. \nOdrick, who played for the Miami Dolphins his first five seasons in the NFL (2010-14) was due a $2 million roster bonus and would have had $3.5 million of his $6.5 million salary for 2017 guaranteed had he still been on the roster March 13. So the Jaguars parted way with a player whose performance never quite matched his paycheck. \nIt surely didn't help that Odrick wanted to spend the offseason training away from Jacksonville. \nThe 29-year-old Odrick signed a five-year deal worth $42.5 million with Jacksonville as an unrestricted free agent in 2015. He appeared in 22 games over two seasons, missing most of last year because of a shoulder injury. Odrick has 170 tackles and 23 sacks in his career. \nOdrick seemed bemused by his release in an Instagram post on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:11:51.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
