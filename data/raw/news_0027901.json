The people around the president The controversy comes as Mr Trump faces his first major national security challenge, following the test by North Korea on Sunday of a ballistic missile.\nMr Flynn would ordinarily be closely involved in determining the US response to such a test.\nHow the controversy unfolded Mr Flynn is known to have spoken with Mr Kislyak several times by phone in December.\nBoth Mr Flynn and US Vice-President Mike Pence denied that the two men discussed US sanctions imposed over Russia's actions in Ukraine and alleged hacking of the US Democratic Party.\nSenior White House Advisor Stephen Miller declined to back Mr Flynn But nine current and former officials later told the Washington Post that the issue had been discussed.\nA spokesman for Mr Flynn subsequently backtracked, telling reporters that the adviser now said he \"couldn't be certain\" he had not discussed the sanctions, prompting speculation that he may have misled the vice-president.\nMr Pence and Mr Flynn reportedly spoke twice on Friday.\nWhat is the White House now saying? Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump's top policy adviser, declined to say when asked in a number of interviews whether Mr Trump backed Mr Flynn.\nMr Miller said it was not his place to comment on the \"sensitive matter\" concerning Mr Flynn, who was an early supporter of Mr Trump but whose position in the administration is thought to be under scrutiny.\nAsked if the president still had confidence in Mr Flynn, Mr Miller responded: \"That's a question for the president.\" Other White House officials also refuse to comment.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that Mr Flynn and Mr Kislyak did not discuss lifting sanctions.\nWhat is the president's view? Mr Trump, who spent the weekend at his club in Florida, Mar-a-Lago, has yet to comment publicly. Mr Flynn was with Mr Trump at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend.\nThe president is expected to face questions on the issue during a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday.\nCiting administration officials, the Associated Press reported that the president was troubled by the situation and uncertain as to whether he would ask Mr Flynn to step down.\nAdviser under fire Mr Flynn was an ardent supporter of Mr Trump during the campaign, and he has become a close ally of both the president and the president's chief strategist Steve Bannon.\nBut questions have been raised about Mr Flynn's closeness with Russia.\nHe attended a banquet last year held in honour of the Russian government, where he sat two seats away from Vladimir Putin.\nMy Flynn was pictured dining with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in December 2015 A top aide on Mr Flynn's team, Robin Townley, was this week denied security clearance by the CIA, preventing Mr Townley from taking up a post in Africa for which Mr Flynn had recommended him.\nAnd Mr Flynn's son has attracted unwelcome attention - and reportedly a personal rebuke from Mr Trump - after tweeting about the so-called Pizzagate fake news story , which alleged a pizzeria was the nexus of a paedophile ring involving Hillary Clinton and one of her aides, John Podesta.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/78CA/production/_94622903_mediaitem94622902.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/110BE/production/_94622896_mediaitem94622895.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/039A/production/_94622900_mediaitem94277585.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38025057", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38231532", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37999969"], "published": "2017-02-13T15:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:46:13.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
