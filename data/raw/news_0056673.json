He's doing–what are you so surprised about? He's doing exactly what he said he's going to do.'\"\nBrzezinski said she is concerned about what Trump's presidency may mean for the media.\n\"Well, and I think that the dangerous, you know, edges here are that he's trying to undermine the media, trying to make up his own facts,\" she said.\nBrzezinski then appeared to argue that the media's job is to control what people think, adding that the president is interfering with it.\n\"And it could be that while unemployment and the economy worsens, he could have undermined the messaging so much that he can actually control exactly what people think. And that, that is our job,\" she said.\n  Politics and tagged Donald Trump , Media , Mika Brzezinski , Morning Joe  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:37:00.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
