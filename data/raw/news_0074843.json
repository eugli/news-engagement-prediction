The list is mostly based on official support websites launched by HMD Global in recent weeks, as sources believe that the new websites are a good indication of markets on which Nokia is initially planning to focus in the coming months. The list includes the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, Finland, Poland, Ukraine, Russia, India, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, and South Africa. Note that these aren’t necessarily the only countries in which Nokia will launch at least one device over the course of this year, but it’s likely that the company will make them a priority over other markets. \nDevices that are expected to be released by Nokia in the coming months include the Nokia 3, Nokia 5, and the Nokia 6 that already debuted in China, as well as a revised version of the Nokia 3310 . All of the aforementioned devices are expected to be unveiled by Nokia at the upcoming Mobile World Congress (MWC). It’s possible that the company will also use the Barcelona-based trade show as an opportunity to reveal more details about the premium Nokia 8, a device that’s been the subject of many rumors circulating the industry in recent months. Out of the countries listed above, the UK, Germany, Russia, and Taiwan will almost certainly get at least some upcoming Nokia devices in the near future seeing how those countries have either already certified a number of Nokia-branded phones or their local retailers have confirmed that they’ll soon start selling the devices. \nThe absence of the United States from the aforementioned list is unfortunate, but not completely surprising seeing how recent reports suggest that Nokia is planning to gradually introduce new devices over the course of this year and will initially be focused on entry-level and mid-range offerings. Seeing how the U.S. is the largest market for premium smartphones in the world, it’s possible that the Finnish phone maker isn’t in a hurry to return to that market before it’s ready to launch a flagship device. In any case, more details on Nokia’s future plans are bound to follow tomorrow once the company holds its MWC 2017 conference.
