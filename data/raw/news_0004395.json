Credit: Clatterbridge A specialist cancer unit on the Wirral has been rated 'outstanding' in all areas by health inspectors.\nThe report said the Clatterbridge centre had 'some of the most advanced techniques and equipment in the country'.\nThe Care Quality Commission inspected the Merseyside specialist cancer centre in June 2016 and found staff were “enthusiastic and willing to go the extra mile”.\nThe inspectors also praised the leadership of the Trust, its clear strategy, and a number of treatment innovations that have been introduced.\nThey included a rapid chemotherapy chair to speed up waiting times and the Chemotherapy at Home programme, which sees cancer patients being treated in their own homes.\nThe inspectors said of the latter: “This service embodied the overall Trust and service vision of providing the best cancer care to their patients.”\nAlso singled out for praise was the prescribing of Adjuvant Zoledronatec - or bisphosphonates – a bone strengthening drug that has been found to prevent the spread of some newly diagnosed breast cancers and is the subject of a campaign by a cancer charity to make it more widely available.\nThe CQC said this innovation was “market leading” and ensured “patients with breast cancer were receiving the very latest evidence based treatment to reduce their risk of death and reoccurrence”.\nIn chemotherapy staff were praised for being passionate and committed.\nThe feedback from patients was outstanding.

Here they also found a robust leadership which contributed to a culture of improvement, and said patients were “extremely complementary about the service”.\nThey added: “We spoke with the parents of a child who was having radiotherapy; they said the treatment and care their child had received was exemplary especially by the specialist radiographer.”\nThe teenage and young adult unit was singled out for enabling family to stay overnight with patients, and holding monthly peer group meetings, like pizza evenings or afternoon tea.\nAt their radiotherapy treatment centre in Aintree, the inspectors highlighted a group of volunteers who organised events and activities for patients to improve their well-being.\nThe inspectors rated end of life care as good, noting the services were led by a dedicated specialist palliative care consultant and team of specialist nurses with a clear vision.\nThe report also noted the fact the Trust has a “wide portfolio of research and was involved in both treatment and data trials”.\nThere's also a special mention for Callie, the Wirral centre’s pet therapy dog who visits the wards. Credit: Clatterbridge Cancer is the loneliest place to be in the world, when you’re standing in a storm alone and wondering what to do and it’s dark and then suddenly you’ve got all these friendly faces looking at you and offering you a hand to get through. That’s what the staff here do, they pull you through or even carry you through the storm which is the darkest time of your life and they lighten it up for you.\n– Patient on Delamere Daycase Unit We are delighted with the overall rating of Outstanding\nIt recognises the high standard of compassionate care our staff strive to provide for every single patient who comes through the doors.\nIt's testament to our commitment to transform cancer care in Cheshire and Merseyside. Our new hospital due to open in Liverpool City Centre in 2019 will ensure we are able to continue to be at the forefront of cancer care.\nI am very proud of the hard work and dedication shown by all our staff and volunteers. They fully deserve this rating.\nHowever we are always looking to improve in everything we do and we will ensure we learn from all areas of the inspectors’ feedback as we look towards the future and working closely and positively with the community we serve.”\n– Andrew Cannell, Chief Executive of The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust Last updated Wed 1 Feb 2017 Cheshire Merseyside Clatterbridge Centre", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T13:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T08:56:09.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
