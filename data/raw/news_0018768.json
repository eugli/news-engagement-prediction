But don't think the couple's delayed nuptials are cause for concern. Bristowe and Booth are happily living together in Nashville, Tennessee -- she's working on music, while he's delving into fitness -- and are more in love than ever. EXCLUSIVE: 'Bachelorette' Couple Kaitlyn Bristowe and Shawn Booth Play 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' ET's Lauren Zima sat down with Bristowe in Los Angeles on Wednesday, where she opened up about finding love on TV -- and life after it. \"I think [Shawn and I are still together] because we didn't jump into another show, we just went back to somewhat of a normal life,\" Bristowe said of how she and her fiancé have beat the Bachelor curse. \"We spend every second of every day together,\" she added. \"I'm like, 'How?' We must really love each other, because I wouldn't be able to fake that… He is my best friend and he just happens to be extremely attractive, so it all just worked out.\" Though Bristowe is glad she and Booth had some time to themselves, she's not opposed to doing more reality television -- but only on her terms.

ABC, come on, bring on a wedding!\" Bristowe proposed. \"I'll get married to Shawn tomorrow!\" EXCLUSIVE: 'Bachelorette' Kaitlyn Bristowe Is 'Not Ashamed' of Having Sex on the Show! As for why it's taken so long for the couple to walk down the aisle, Bristowe says she and Booth haven't been offered a televised wedding, but they aren't necessarily in any rush. \"We aren't in any rush, but that has a lot to do with planning and us just not having time,\" she explained. \"I don't question my relationship with him, and I don't know why… We're more excited to have babies than we are to like, sign a piece of paper. But at the same time, I can't wait to marry him.\" \"There were so many times [we almost got married]. Like, we were in Hawaii and we were like, 'Should we just get married?' I think at the time, Bachelor still owned the rights to our wedding, though,\" Bristowe continued, adding that they realized pressure from fans won't stop after they tie the knot. \"We might as well just do whatever we want.\" \nEven so, they're already looking to the future. Bristowe foresees she and Booth starting their own family down the line.
