Australia is learning the hard way that Donald Trump is every bit the rule-breaker he promised to be, writes Greg Jennett. \nOne US-relations expert pointed out that turbulence in the relationship is the historical norm at the outset of new American administrations â€” with the exception of Barack Obama. \nAnother attributed Mr Trump's lack of foreign policy specifics to his supporters, saying the US leader knew they would rather hear about domestic issues. \nOverall, there is a fair degree of optimism the new US leader does know what he's doing, and much of his rhetoric is gamesmanship to try to extract a more favourable trade position. \nWhether that's possible is another story. \nBut on the foreign policy front, the past few days have eased many of the Chinese concerns. \nTwo of Mr Trump's top appointees have softened their tough talk on confronting Beijing over its new military bases in the disputed South China Sea, while Mr Trump himself has broken the ice with a letter to Mr Xi. \nHe not only called for a \"constructive relationship\", he also wished the Chinese people a \"prosperous Year of the Rooster\". \nThat phone may be ringing soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:12:28.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
