Debbie Lesko   (Photo: Arizona Senate) \nYou know all that talk about how Arizona’s public schools are critically underfunded? About how our governor wants to boost school spending and even proposed giving teachers a whole 4/10ths of a percent pay raise ?\nAbout how Republican legislators repeatedly assure us they support public education, then stick a dagger in its gut every time they think no one’s looking?\nArizona, meet this year’s dagger: Senate Bill 1174 .\nThe bill would put at risk $211 million in school funding. This, as Gov. Doug Ducey has proposed boosting funding for schools by $114 million (including $14 million for that vast 4/10ths of a percent pay raise.)\nHow desegregation funding works Specifically, SB 1174 would require 18 school districts to ask their voters if they want to continue providing money they now automatically get to target discrimination and boost achievement among disadvantaged students.\nThe bill’s sponsor is none other than Sen. Debbie Lesko, that fine Peoria crusader for public education who also is working feverishly to expand Arizona’s voucher program in order to divert more tax money to private schools.\nThat is, when she’s not taking a whack at that $211 million – money that helps fund school districts in Phoenix, Tucson, Glendale, Scottsdale and Mesa, among other places.\nROBERTS: Should teachers say thanks for a $2-a-week pay raise? \nSince the mid-1980s, certain school districts have been allowed to levy an extra property tax aimed at remediating discrimination. This “desegregation funding” doesn’t require voter approval given decades-old federal civil-rights mandates or in the case of Tucson Unified, a continuing court order to end discrimination.\nLesko and the impeccably-connected Arizona Tax Research Association have been targeting desegregation funds for years on the theory that it isn’t fair to the school districts that don’t get extra money.\n“I have low income areas in my district and they get no desegregation funding,” Lesko told the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday. “That’s what’s so unfair about this.”\nSurprise (not)! Corporations back the bill So, of course, her answer isn’t to boost funding in Peoria and the rest of the state’s abysmally funded school districts but to reduce funding for these 18 school districts.\nATRA sees the desegregation tax levies as “some of the most abusive tax inequities in the state” and a “significant economic development hindrance.”\nThat isn’t surprising given that ATRA represents corporations. Its board is jam packed with representatives of the state’s biggest property taxpayers and chaired by a guy employed by the biggest of them all, Arizona Public Service.\nLesko’s bill would essentially turn automatic desegregation funding into an override, requiring voters to approve the tax in order to continue it for the next seven years.\nAs Lesko said, “If you’re confident that the voters support this, then you don’t have a problem.”\nAt least, not until those corporations invest big bucks into \"dark money\" campaigns to defeat them and boost their bottom lines. But I digress.\nWho stands to lose if this passes During Tuesday’s hearing, parent after parent stood up to oppose the bill, saying now isn’t the time to take away funding from the schools, which are still coping with drastic cuts our leaders made during the recession.\nMeanwhile ATRA spoke for it, saying most of the affected taxpayers have no idea they are paying an extra desegregation tax.\nBesides ATRA, those on record as supporting the bill include the Arizona Retailers Association, the Apollo Group, CenturyLink, the East Valley Chambers of Commerce Alliance, Americans for Prosperity and the Arizona Free Enterprise Club, which would be the perfect dark-money group to run the anti-override campaigns.\nAmong those signed up to oppose the bill were school districts, various school associations and 150 or so citizens.\nSo naturally the bill passed, with Republicans approving it on a 6-4 partyline vote.\nIf it clears the Legislature and is signed by Ducey, Tucson Unified could lose $63.7 million and Phoenix Union High School District could lose nearly $56 million. Tempe Elementary could lose $14 million and Roosevelt Elementary could lose $13.5 million.\nOther losses: Phoenix Elementary, $11.1 million; Mesa: $8.7 million; Scottsdale: $7.3 million; Washington Elementary, $6.3 million; Glendale Union, $6.1 million; Isaac, $4.9 million; Cartright, $4.6 million; Amphitheater, $4 million; Holbrook, $2.5 million; Flagstaff, $2.2 million, Wilson, $1.9 million; Buckeye, $1.6 million, Maricopa, $1.3 million, and Agua Fria, $1 million.\nBtw, here's how they voted Here’s how the votes lined up at Tuesday’s hearing.\nSupporting the bill: Republicans Sylvia Allen of Snowflake, Steve Montenegro of Litchfield Park, Warren Petersen of Gilbert, Steve Smith of Maricopa, John Kavanagh of Fountain Hills and Lesko.\nOpposing the bill: Democrats Olivia Cajero Bedford of Tucson, Steve Farley of Tucson, Katie Hobbs of Phoenix and Martin Quezada of Phoenix.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:35:41.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
