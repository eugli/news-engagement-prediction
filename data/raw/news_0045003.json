At the Inn’s Broadway Review event — which benefitted the Newtown Action Alliance , an organization dedicated to ending gun violence — Blanchett took the stage wearing a gold bra-and-undies combo beneath a black blazer for the sultry, commanding performance. Luckily, it was captured on video. \nBlanchett headlined the event along with hair-and-makeup artist Jason Hayes, and the night featured additional performances by drag queens Aurora Sexton, Candice Cox, Vanice Vega, Zola Powell, and Brenda Dharling. The Stonewall Inn released a video of Margeaux Powell’s performance, during which she was joined on stage by Blanchett, who sported a pink pussy hat. \nSee pictures and videos from the night below: A post shared by David (@weaselingaround) on Feb 20, 2017 at 9:47pm PST \nA post shared by Ian Carlos Crawford (@ianxcarlos) on Feb 21, 2017 at 9:15am PST A post shared by Ian Carlos Crawford (@ianxcarlos) on Feb 20, 2017 at 8:05pm PST A post shared by Stonewall (@thestonewallinn) on Feb 20, 2017 at 6:20pm PST Show Full Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:53:15.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
