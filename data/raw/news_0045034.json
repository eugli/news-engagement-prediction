United have a 3-0 lead from the first leg of the tie. \n\"Rooney is injured. Jones is injured. I don't think they will recover,\" the manager added. \"Rooney and Jones haven't trained with the team yet so I don't think they will be there for Wednesday.\" \nUnited, who have won the League Cup four times before, beat Hull City 2-0 at Old Trafford before losing 2-1 away in the semi-final to progress to the final with a 3-2 aggregate score. \nSouthampton beat Liverpool 1-0 both home and away in the semis to book their first major Wembley final since losing to Nottingham Forest in the 1979 League Cup final.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:23:24.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
