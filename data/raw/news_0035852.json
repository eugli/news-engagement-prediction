I have no confusion in my mind that this party is mine. I know this party belongs to ‘netaji’,” he said. \nIn a veiled attack on his uncle Shivpal Yadav, Akhilesh said there were people who tried to test him.

I had to act according to the situation and then take appropriate decision,” he said. \n“Agar hamare saath itne vidhayak na hote to hamara raasta kya hota? Agar mere paas 10 vidhayak aur kuch sanghthan ke log hote to hamari haisiyat aur halat kya hoti? (If I had the support of only 10 MLAs and a few people from the organisation, what would have been my status and situation?),” asked Akhilesh. \nCriticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for questioning the alliance between the SP and the Congress, Akhilesh said two young leaders had joined hands to stop communal forces in the state. \nSpeaking about those who were damaging the party from within, Akhilesh said such people might not be there in this constituency but were active in nearby areas. \nAkhilesh addressed four public meetings in different areas on Thursday. \nSP candidates are heavily relying on Akhilesh’s visits, more so after the cancellation of three rallies of Mulayam that were scheduled for February 13. \nSenior BJP leaders Rajnath Singh, Kalraj Mishra, Keshav Prasad Maurya and Swami Prasad Maurya have already addressed public meetings in Mainpuri in support of BJP candidates. \nIn the 2012 assembly elections, the Samajwadi Party had won all four assembly seats in Mainpuri district.
