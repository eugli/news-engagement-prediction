Safe travel destinations for Brits Sun, August 7, 2016 The recent string of horrific terror attacks has left everyone worried about their own safety. And many people have already cancelled holidays to destinations like Turkey and Spain, following recent atrocities. Here are the safest destinations. Getty Images/LOOK 1 of 10 Switzerland - The FCO has also listed the European country as having a low threat from terrorism. British nationals made 711,595 visits to Switzerland in 2014. Most visits were recorded as trouble-free. \nSimilarly, Uniworld has confirmed it is scrapping stops at all Turkish ports for 2017, but has yet to provide an alternative. \nTurkey, previously a hugely popular destination with British tourists, was subject to a number of terrorist attacks last year. \nThere was an attack in Istanbul airport in June 2016 that resulted in 42 deaths and, on December 11, a twin bomb attack on police outside a football stadium in Istanbul killed 38 people. \nOn January 1 2017, there was an attack on the Reina nightclub in Ortakoy, Istanbul; 39 people were killed and 69 injured. \nAfter the attacks in the summer, cruise lines started pulling out of trips to Istanbul , including Crystal, Disney and MSC Cruises. \nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office has issued this official advice: \"There is a high threat from terrorism. Terrorist groups, including Kurdish groups, Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) and far left organisations, continue to plan and carry out attacks. \n\"There is a heightened risk of terrorist attack against the aviation industry in Turkey. You should co-operate fully with security officials at airports. \n“The Turkish authorities have successfully disrupted attack planning in the recent past and have said that security has been tightened in response to recent attacks. But further attacks are likely and could be indiscriminate.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:28:39.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
