(Colleen Jones/CBC)\nGrand Fondo is a type of long distance cycling event that originated in Italy but has become popular in other countries. \nThree years ago, the Municipality of Clare began exploring the idea of a new tourism event to draw people to the area. It wasn't long before work began on a cycling event that would embrace healthy living, Acadian culture and the region's natural beauty.\n\"It's one of those events where I think everybody in Clare can take great pride in,\" said Larry Peach, the municipality's tourism manager.\nGran Fondo Baie Sainte-Marie a boost to local economy \nBanff GranFondo cycling event braces for more bears, wolves along route \nFour hundred cyclists, most of them recreational riders, signed up for the first Gran Fondo in September 2015. More than double that number took part last year.\nThe event has four different levels, ranging from 35 kilometres to 161 kilometres. Cyclists travel past some of Clare's old churches, including the enormous wooden Ã‰glise Sainte-Marie Church, and the route offers up views of St. Marys Bay and Digby Neck.\n\"The vast majority of riders are doing it for fun and the social experience,\" said Peach. \"A lot of people are coming here for the first time and visiting a new part of Nova Scotia.\"\nThe grand fondo attracted more than 800 cyclists last year.

The other finalists in the category are sport-hosting groups in Vancouver and Burnaby, B.C.\n\"We have hundreds of volunteers and everybody shows up and gives 100 per cent,\" said Doucet. \"That's why the event is such a success. It's a community effort.\"\nRegistration for the third annual Gran Fondo Baie Sainte-Marie, to be held Sept. 24, is now open. Organizers are expecting the event to continue to grow.\n\"We've handled it so far and if it continues to get bigger then we'll just accommodate more people and I think we'll be OK,\" said Doucet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:19:19.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
