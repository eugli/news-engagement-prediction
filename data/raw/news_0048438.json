Despite being initially employed as a chef Azad was required to to clean rooms, work in the garden, clear snow and provide labor for tradesmen of the hotel, which attracted hundreds of visitors at a time in peak season. In order to pay for his visa Azad had to sell his wife's jewelry and a small piece of land that his father owned. The three men sought help at a local charity called Lochaber Hope, which put the men in touch with a migrant rights NGO called Migrant Help, one year after they arrived in the UK. Jim Laird, who worked for Migrant Help at the time, told CNN : 'The men first came to my attention late in 2009. They were in a terrible state, they'd clearly been brought over for labor exploitation. Shamsul Arefin was jailed for three years in 2015 for human trafficking offences (Police handout) 'Their working conditions were very poor. They'd had to pay a lot of money to come here to the owner of the hotel, they weren't paid properly, they were working really long hours, sometimes up to 22 hours a day. 'They were forced to do all of the work to do with running the hotel, not just chefs, which they had been brought over to do.' He added: 'There were probably about a dozen men involved, but only four of them who agreed to come and be supported by Migrant Help and then also to go to the police and have the case prosecuted.' The trafficked men say they were able to stay in the UK on short-term temporary work visas after agreeing to testify as witnesses in the criminal investigation into Arefin but they now face deportation back to Bangladesh. And Azad claims his life will be at risk, should he return to his county of birth. The father of one said: 'You can ask me the question, why do you not leave this country and go back to your home country? Yeah I can go back, anytime I can go back, and in maybe one or two months you can find my dead body.' 'My son is growing up without me, this is no life. And he had a dream too that he wanted to come with me and join with me, he wanted to play with the snow.' Azad and the three victims are currently negotiating their appeal to remain in the UK and to bring their families over to them. In a statement the Home Office said they wouldn't comment on individual cases but maintained that 'anyone who feels that they would be at threat by returning to their home country is able to apply for asylum.' Shamsul Arefin, 47, was sentenced to three years' imprisonment in July 2015 after being convicted of trafficking four workers from Bangladesh. Police said Arefin was 'driven by financial greed' and had no regard for the 'poor' conditions of the workers. Arefin carried out the offences between 2008 and 2010 when he was the owner of the Stewart Hotel near Appin.
