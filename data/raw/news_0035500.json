While many of them enjoyed Bany W’s visited, Gifty thought differently during her Diary Session. \nAccording to the housemate, she doesn’t know who Banky W is, felt he was too full of pride, especially because of the way he carried himself – as though he was paid to appear on the show. \nHer comments stirred reactions on social media yesterday. Many Nigerians had unkind things to say about the housemate and Banky W fueled the negative reactions too. \n“To be fair, I dunno know her much either,” he tweeted yesterday, adding, “opinions are like assholes and everyone has one and is entitled to it. Doesn’t mean it isn’t full of sh*t.” \nHowever, the EME boss returned last night to officially address the claims, while asking Nigerians to quit dragging the housemate.

I was in town for another gig and the producers asked if I could come on as a favour and give the contestants some advice that will be helpful to them down the line, which is all I tried to do,” Banky W said in his post. \nSee the full post below: \nLol..okay, Quick thoughts: \nYall shld pls try and have mercy on her. 1) Not sure why she feels like I have “proudness”😩😂, but I certainly wasn’t paid to appear. I was in town for another gig and the producers asked if I could come on as a favour and give the contestants some advice that will be helpful to them down the line, which is all I tried to do. I think all the other contestants enjoyed our time together so it’s all good. 2) The thoughts I shared weren’t for the contestants alone; hopefully my words were beneficial to all the viewers at home. 3) It’s okay if Gifty, or anyone else doesn’t know who I am. I never assume that they do, or that they should. Pls if you don’t know me, feel free to epp my career – Google me or look up my music catalogue on YouTube.. or watch the wedding party movie. Whenever Gifty does make it home, she will have the opportunity to do the same. Lastly, big thank you to the #bbnaija Producers for having me on. I truly enjoyed my time on the show, and I always gain a sense of fulfilment whenever I get the chance to share my story and life lessons with people. \nGod bless us all and may the best contestant win! 😆👌👍🙌 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T13:31:54.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
