Thanks to frequent checks & amazing doctors, all's well. Looks worse w the dressing on then off! WEARSUNSCREEN (sic).\" \nHugh, who is now required to have his skin checked every three months, previously also had cancer removed from his shoulder and has been vocal about urging others to get checked. \nHe has said: \"It's always a bit of a shock just hearing the word 'cancer'. Being an Australian, [skin cancer] is a very common thing. I never wore sunscreen growing up so I was a prime candidate for it. Hugh has urged fans to use sunscreen (Photo: Splash) \n\"I was trying to keep calm about it... basal cell carcinoma is just something you have to deal with. It's cancerous. It will grow. You just have to get it out. \n\"I go every three months for checkups. It's the new normal for me. My doctor says I'll likely have more and if that's your cross to bear in life, you should be so lucky.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:10:27.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
