Vigneault, 35, was producing and playing a 24-hour marathon of the online game World Of Tanks when he reportedly “stepped out for a smoke” during the 22nd hour of the marathon and never returned to the stream. \nPVP Live quotes a moderator from Vigneault’s Twitch chat channel, who said that they tried to contact him several hours later, only to be answered by someone claiming to be a detective with his local police department. Kotaku later confirmed that Vigneault was dead, although a cause of death has not been announced. Foul play is not suspected. \nVigneault, a father of three, was a well-liked member of the game-streaming community, known for frequently drinking and smoking while he played. According to his Twitch profile , his channel—which has now been converted into a “memorial channel” by the streaming company—raised more than $10,000 for charity over the years. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:08:17.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
