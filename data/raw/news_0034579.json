(Photo: Getty Images) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPresident Trump signed his first legislation Tuesday, scrapping an anti-corruption measure that requires oil and mining companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments. \nâ€œThis is a big signing, very important signing,\" Trump said in the Oval Office as he signed the legislation. \"We're bringing back jobs big league. We're bringing them back at the plant level. We're bringing them back at the mine level. The energy jobs are coming back.\" \nEmploying a legislative tactic called the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers overturned the rule earlier this month, following aggressive lobbying from energy companies, including Exxon Mobil. Rex Tillerson, Exxon's former CEO, is now the Secretary of State. \nThe rule, implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, was mandated in 2010 by the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, better known as Dodd-Frank. After a court battle, the SEC introduced it last year in June. \nAt the time of its introduction, the said the rule was devised \"to advance U.S. policy interests by promoting greater transparency about payments related to resource extraction.\" \nIt requires public companies that extract oil, natural gas or minerals abroad to disclose in an annual report any payments made to a foreign government or the U.S. federal government. Companies were not required to comply with the rule until their first fiscal year ending on or after Sept. 30, 2018.
