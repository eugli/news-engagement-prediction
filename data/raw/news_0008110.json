So I decided to start keeping track,‚Äù Baguma told CTV Atlantic.\nThrough clever retweets, cheeky memes and plenty of caps-lock rage, the account has garnered more than 143,000 followers. High-profile endorsements from TV producer Dan Harmon and billionaire investor Chris Sacca and follows from Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell and Mark Cuban have helped stoke the following, too.\nBaguma is humble about the account‚Äôs popularity and says she only spends about 15 minutes each day looking for vitriolic tweets to profile.\n‚ÄúObviously it‚Äôs not me, I‚Äôm not doing anything. I‚Äôm just retweeting people. But it‚Äôs fun to interact with these people,‚Äù she said.\n@realdonaldtrump I voted for you expecting someone to shake up DC but was wrong. I regret voting for you.
