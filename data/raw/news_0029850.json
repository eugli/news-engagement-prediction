So, it’s about striking the balance,” he said. \n\"We'll also be providing greater support through subsidies enhancements and also through other types of schemes, for example ElderShield (and) other types of measures to help patients when they need these services, beyond hospital beds,\" he added. - CNA/xk ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T15:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:33:16.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
