For the charismatic couple whose personality is etched in the walls of their restaurant, the Outside Inn, simply selling their business the \"normal way\" felt lackluster.\nInstead, the prospective new owners of the Outside Inn will get the keys to the place with just a 200-word essay and a $125 entry fee.\n“I think it’s great to get to pay it forward.” said David Bain about his choice to sell the restaurant with an essay contest.\nMore than just the keys to the 2,000-square-foot restaurant located south of Tucson in Sierra Vista, the winner will get everything associated with the business, from the kitchen equipment to the contents of the refrigerators and internet domain.\n“They get it all,” he said. “For essentially nothing. For being themselves. This whole thing is couched in the fact that what we are doing is offering someone an opportunity to change their own life.”\nSharing an opportunity The Bains are passionate about sharing the opportunity of running a restaurant after spending their entire careers in the industry.\nIn 1989, the Bains moved from Colorado to operate a restaurant in Tempe. Two years later, the couple made the move to Sierra Vista to open their own place, a 1960s home that soon was converted into a well-liked Arizona restaurant. \n“I love the restaurant business, and I love the Outside Inn in particular,” he said. “What we built in 23 years is cute, small, has personality, it’s well received ... I really enjoy what it is that we do.”\nThe restaurant aims to serve \"fine dining\" entrees in a casual atmosphere with dishes such as shrimp carbonara, broiled lobster tail and filet mignon. But Bain says that the new owners don’t need to keep the current menu, or even the theme of the restaurant.\nThe Outside Inn features a casual restaurant atmosphere. The menu features a wide variety of entrees ranging from broiled lobster to filet mignon.   (Photo: David Bain) \nContest details The Bains had been planning to sell their restaurant since the summer and began to finalize details to offer an essay contest in August when they posted on theoutsideinnblog.wordpress.com, with contest details and rules. According to the site, those entering need to submit a 200-word essay answering the question, “Why do I want to own my own restaurant” along with a $125 entry fee by April 17.\nHow can an entrant win?\n“We are looking for someone whose words just jump off the page and capture our hearts,” Bain said.\nEntry fee criticism The couple has received some online criticism about the entry fee, suggesting that the restaurant is no longer being \"given away\" if the contest receives its goal of 7,500 entrants, and nearly a million dollars in entry fee charges.\n“The value of the property alone is nearly $400,000,” Bain said in response. “That isn’t even including anything in it, or the fact that it’s a whole restaurant.”\nIf no winner is chosen, Bain said he will refund the money to entrants. He may also decide to accept fewer entries than the specified goal.\nBain also emphasized that the writer of the essay that is chosen will have their entry fee refunded to them, meaning that they will get the whole restaurant completely for free. Additionally, he and his wife plan to donate some of the contest entry funds to charity — specifically causes in the Sierra Vista area, where they plan to stay after the restaurant has transferred ownership.\n“I want to give back to the people that allowed us to be successful in the last 23 years,” he said.\nNot the first Bain is hardly alone in his seemingly wacky venture to sell his business through an essay contest. Janice Sage made national headlines in 1993 when she acquired the Center Lovell Inn in southern Maine. She won the inn with a $100 entry fee and an essay that demonstrated her enthusiasm to own and operate her own inn.\nHowever, in 2014, when Sage attempted to sell the business in the same way that she had won it nearly 20 years prior, she had a very different experience. Sage felt the same way many other businesses do that try to use an essay contest; defeated. It took Sage two attempts at a contest before she finally sold the inn.\nFor the business owner who wants to ensure the buyer is equally invested in the business as they once were, a contest can seem attractive. But many businesses have proven to be unsuccessful in attempting to do so, and some critics worry that the Outside Inn contest will not yield the results that its owners are looking for.\nAs for Bain, he is hopeful that the winner of the contest will have the same entrepreneurial spirit that brought him and his wife to have 23 successful years with the Outside Inn and is enthusiastic about the response that they have seen so far.\n“It’s unconventional and quirky ... but that’s who we are.”\nTop food, drink events in February around Phoenix\nRestaurant inspections: 7 Phoenix-area restaurant on this week's list", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:11:41.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
