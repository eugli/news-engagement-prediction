Sheâ€™s a newbie to live TV presenting and was certainly thrown in at the deep end. After being flown in a helicopter to a random street, she had to run around and try and find people waving at their windows, as instructed by Ant and Dec in the studio. She got a couple â€“ eventually (Screengrab/ITV) More But of course, no-one was waving at any windows on the street she was on because thatâ€™s the kind of thing that happens to people on live TV. Missed the first part of #SNT because I was stood in the brightest house on my street waving out the front window @antanddec \nâ€” Roisin Charnley (@RoisinColgan) February 25, 2017 But fans thought she still handled it like a pro by coming up with her own rules â€“ just knock on a house and hope for the best. Scarlett Moffat actually funny on #SaturdayNightTakeaway but the new wave and knock on the door thing is awkward lol \nâ€” Rob Gilbert-Warsop (@robpw2) February 25, 2017 What if you were in your pjs when Scarlett knocked on the door? ðŸ˜‚ #SaturdayNightTakeaway \nâ€” Caroline Sheriff (@CaroSheriff) February 25, 2017 When someone answered, she yelled at them to get their shoes on, which made people laugh even more.
