Both were born in China, but later become US citizens. \nThe rise of China’s millionaire research scientists \nYang and Yao were previously foreign members of the academy, but are now listed as domestic members on its website. \nThe academy said it was the first time any of its foreign members had dropped their overseas citizenship, according to the TV report. \nNo details were given about when the men had changed citizenship. \nYang and Yao now live in China after working for many years in the US and are professors at Tsinghua University in Beijing. \nThey could not immediately be reached for comment. \nYang is one of the greatest living scientists of the 20th century and his decision to give up his foreign citizenship could serve as an example to other ethnic Chinese scientists to give up their foreign citizenship, according to Ning Chuangang, a professor of physics at Tsinghua university. \nNing said younger Chinese researchers might find it easier to find funding for their work back in China as it massively expands its scientific research programme. \n“Some have already given up [foreign citizenship]. It may become a trend,” he said. \nYang was a joint winner of the Nobel Prize for his research into the decay of subatomic particles. \nYao won the Turing Prize for his contributions to computer science, including research into cryptography. \nChina has launched numerous national programmes to try to recruit top researchers from overseas universities and institutes. \nThe “Thousand Talent” project financed by Chinese Communist Party’s central organisation department offers attractive financial packages and generous funding to researchers attracted to China, regardless of their nationality or citizenship.
