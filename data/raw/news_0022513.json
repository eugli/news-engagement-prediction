He checked what was really left by Wylie & Bisset and found an antique lace dress in a crumpled heap on the floor.\n\"My mum and dad have just been let in to the shop and to their amazement and joy it is our dress! (not cleaned but still with our ticket).\"\nShe said a representative from sequestrators Wylie & Bisset insisted that for \"procedural reasons\" the dress had to go back to his office in Glasgow.\nShe added: \"They have assured us that it will be delivered safely back to us on Monday.\n\"My family can't thank you all enough for creating this frenzy which allowed us into the shop before it was cleared, and are over the moon to be (almost) reunited with Dora's dress.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-38935251", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158260367815711&set=a.10153529600020711.1073741845.500590710&type=3&theater", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158254832225711&set=a.10150413397240711.627624.500590710&type=3&theater", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2E28/production/_94261811_mediaitem94261810.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/13A3D/production/_94254408_16508922_10158254832225711_3261454927076561581_n.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-11T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T18:43:32.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
