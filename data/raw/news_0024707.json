These matches are always special,\" Argentina coach Edgardo Bauza said in a statement. \n\"We look forward to meeting in Melbourne. \n\"Our priority is to prepare for the important World Cup qualifiers coming up in 2017 and this match and the camp will be extremely valuable.\" \nThe availability of the two country's mega-stars will be the major talking point. \nTouring club sides in recent years have opted to leave their biggest names at home, sparing them the cross-continental flights during the off-season. \nOff the back of an arduous club campaign, and with a 2017/18 season that finishes with the World Cup, it remains to be seen whether organisers will guarantee the availability of Messi, Neymar and others. \nShould the star Argentinian play, it will be his first match at the MCG since masterminding a 1-0 defeat of Australia in a friendly in September 2007. \nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:12:15.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
