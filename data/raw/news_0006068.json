The criticism is selective here. If it’s a Bollywood actress, then it’s fine but if it’s a TV actress then it’s definitely a problem. “Atleast apse to ye umeed ni thi (didn’t expect this atleast from you)” read a comment on Sriti Jha ‘s bikini picture. So, why is it not ‘okay’ for TV actresses to shed their ‘sanskaari’ image? It’s clearly because of the characters they play on television. The leading ladies on small-screen are often esteemed as paragon of spousal and feminine virtues. They are never shown in skirts or shorts, leave alone bikinis. They are known for their dedication towards their families, self-sacrifice, courage and ‘purity’. As a result, television loyalists make demi-gods out of them. \nI am not trying to say that life is any easier for Bollywood actresses. They receive their share of criticism too. But, their lovers almost always out number their haters. Also, the variety of characters these actresses portray on big screen play an important role in the image people sketch of them in their minds. She is a bitter prostitute in one film and a compassionate wife in another. She dances in sarees in one film and kicks ass as a cop in another. Their image changes in every three hours! So it’s kinda difficult for the audience to form a static image of them. But, in television that’s not the case. The leading ladies here play the same roles for years (sometimes for a decade, too!). The kind of connect the audience forms with them is totally unmatchable. \nTimes are changing and things are definitely improving in television. But, when it comes to accepting TV actresses’ personal lives, it seems that we have yet a long way to go. But with non-conformists like Nia present in the industry, we are hopeful of seeing a ray of sunshine soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T15:01:14.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
