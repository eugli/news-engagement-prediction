This time around it’s Blissey, the evolution of Chansey introduced in Pokémon Gold and Silver , who’s taking over Pokémon Go one gym at a time . tfw someone already has a Blissey in the gym with my Granbull pic.twitter.com/D6p8388l8F — Nikki (@NWPlayer123) February 17, 2017 You’ll need 50 pieces of candy to evolve a Chansey, which was pretty rare in the original version of Pokémon Go , and many players have already achieved that to produce Blisseys with incredible stats.
