JOSEPH JOHNSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nThere was a long construction hiatus at The Terrace in 2015. \n\"We've got enough leases signed, we've got bank funding in place and it's all go,\" he said. \"I expect to be enjoying a beer there in October.\" READ MORE: * Westpac pulls back on commitment to Gough development \nThe double-storey riverfront hospitality precinct was almost fully leased with 12 out of 14 premises taken, he said. Tenants in the three large ground floor premises facing Oxford Tce will be Richard Sinke, owner of Dux Central, and Tony Astle's Stealth Hospitality Group, plus restaurant Bangalore Polo Club. \nAstle said he was looking forward to getting in and the precinct would be \"wonderful\". KIRK HARGREAVES/FAIRFAX NZ \nAntony Gough is confident The Terrace development will be ready to open in spring. \nUpstairs and facing interior laneways will be Japanese restaurant Zenbu, two Cook Brothers hospitality businesses, a restaurant from the operators of Queenstown restaurant Bungalow, and a new business from former Coyote owner Clive Weston. Velvet Burger, a juice bar and coffee outlets will open on the Hereford St side of the development. \nThe buildings will be linked by laneways and first-floor air bridges, while balconies will overlook the river and internal spaces. Hospitality tenants will start fitting out their premises in June or July. \nA five-storey office building on Hereford St will also be finished by October, while the six-storey office building on the corner of Oxford Tce and Cashel St would be finished in December for tenants Westpac and KPMG to move in by March, Gough said. \nAn artist's impression of The Terrace precinct facing Oxford Tce between Cashel and Hereford streets, in Christchurch. \nNext year, a car parking building will be added on Hereford St next to the neighbouring BNZ Centre. Ad Feedback \nGough said when Westpac reduced the space it wanted it \"threw us into a bit of a tizz\", but KPMG had filled the gap, satisfying the bank's lending department. Other tenants had also been holding back. \nBNZ is funding the development's hospitality buildings and the Hereford St office building. Gough and other members of the family, including his older brothers Tracy and Harcourt, have put about $70m into the project. \nAn impression of the finished Westpac building and courtyard at The Terrace development. \nGough said meeting the banks' lending requirements had proven tough. \n\"They are overly cautious, but they can afford to be. But once the banks start paying money out on a project like this, they see it through to the end.\" \nThe upcoming openings of the justice and emergency services precinct and the Ngai Tahu office buildings nearby had boosted tenants' confidence, he said. Progress on car parking buildings had also helped. \n\"We are seeing all these developments finish and I can't wait for that parking to open.\" \nSLOW PROGRESS \n2011: Antony Gough hopes to repair and reopen The Strip. \nMarch 2013: Joins forces with brother Tracy to announce a replacement called The Terrace. \nSept 2013: Gough goes it alone and starts construction with a late-2014 finish forecast.
