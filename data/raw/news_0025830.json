His next of kin have been informed. \n\"At this time the death is being treated as unexplained but non-suspicious and police are making further inquiries.\" Read More Brave dad takes on 'Rambo knife' thugs at girl's 16th birthday party then confiscates their weapons \nThe death is likely to be referred to the Health and Safety Executive for a full investigation and a report was expected to be prepared for the Berkshire Coroner Peter Bedford. \nThe tragedy mirrors the death of a four-year-old boy in 2013 who died after suffering major injuries when a huge mirror fell on top of him as he shopped with his father in Hugo Boss in the upmarket Bicester shopping outlet. \nPolice said that the boy was unlikely to be named until an inquest had been opened in Reading. \nIt was not yet known whether the schoolboy lived locally or had come with his family to Reading to shop at the Oracle Centre.
