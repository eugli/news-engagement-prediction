Theresa May, pictured with Mr Juncker, has said she will trigger Article 50 in March \nT heresa May, the Prime Minister, has said she will trigger Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty in March to launch divorce talks that can last up to two years. \nEarlier this month, the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill was approved by the Commons after around 40 hours of debate . \nMr Juncker also said at least 20,000 laws had to be changed in Britain before it could leave the bloc and repeated that Britain has no right to complete bilateral trade deals while still in the EU. \n\"Trade deals are the remit of the EU... Britain cannot complete trade deals with half the world - although it is doing the opposite,\" he said. \nHe said at the same event that Europe must not give in to U.S demands to raise military spending. Donald Trump has raised questions over Nato spending Credit: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP \nD onald Trump, the US president, has raised questions about his commitment to NATO if European countries do not meet defence spending targets of 2 per cent of economic output. \n\"It has been the American message for many, many years. I am very much against letting ourselves be pushed into this,\" Mr Juncker said. \n\"I don't like our American friends narrowing down this concept of security to the military,\" he added, arguing it would be sensible to look at a \"modern stability policy\" made up of several components. \n\"If you look at what Europe is doing in defence, plus development aid, plus humanitarian aid, the comparison with the United States looks rather different. Modern politics cannot just be about raising defence spending.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:17:52.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
