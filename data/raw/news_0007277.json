The two have very different backgrounds but are both considered solid conservatives. On Monday, Mr. Trump told reporters, “I think you will be very impressed with this person.” Watch Trump’s Supreme Court nominee announcement live on CBSN . Coverage begins at 7 p.m. ET \nWith degrees from Harvard and Oxford and establishment credentials, Gorsuch has a judicial philosophy modeled after Antonin Scalia , the justice he would replace. \nHardiman is blue collar. He’s the first member of his family to graduate from college – Notre Dame, with honors – and he put himself through Georgetown Law driving a taxi. He would be the only justice from outside the Ivy League. \nIn either case, the president should be ready for a nomination fight. After Senate Republicans refused to give Obama’s pick, Merrick Garland, a hearing, Democrats have already promised to fight Mr. Trump’s nominee. \nFollow along for live updates on the president’s announcement. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
