Murkowski told reporters: “I was trying to get to yes and I couldn’t.”\nUnless any Democrats break ranks, the defections leave Trump perilously close to defeat on a cabinet nominee. Only 50 senators support DeVos. This would force vice-president Mike Pence to cast a tiebreaking vote under Senate rules and one more defection would doom her nomination.\nAt the White House press briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer said he was “100% confident” DeVos would be confirmed and said she was “unbelievably qualified”.\nBetsy DeVos confirmation hearing for education secretary: the key points Read more \nDeVos – a Republican megadonor, philanthropist and eager patron of charter schools – was criticized for her performance before the Senate health, education, labor and pensions committee last month. \nShe refused to state whether she would uphold the Obama administration’s guidance on how to handle campus sexual assault and suggested guns might belong in schools due to the threat posed by grizzly bears. \nDemocrats have sought to raise alarms around her support for expanding charter schools and school vouchers, which critics argue undermine public education due to lack of regulation and accountability.\nEthics watchdogs have also raised questions over potential conflicts of interest, as DeVos and her family have made political contributions amounting to millions of dollars toward Super Pacs and Republican candidates – particularly in favor of school choice.\nSenate rules require a simple majority of 51 votes for cabinet appointees. Republicans account for 52 of the 100 senators.\nSo far, five of Trump’s cabinet nominees have been confirmed by the US Senate with only secretary of state Rex Tillerson – who was confirmed on Wednesday – facing a heavily contested vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T22:14:51.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
