Factory options allow buyers to bump them up to a whopping 21-inch wheel. What makes them look even larger, though, is how close the top of the hood is to the top of the tires — only a few inches separate them. It's something you can only appreciate in person, as pictures don't adequately capture how low the LC 500’s hood truly is. Lexus \nDON’T LOOK AT THIS: \nLexus may be all-in on the spindle grille, but it's still a polarizing design that's hit or miss with the crowds. Up close, the mesh pattern is mesmerizing. From afar, it's a design choice that may make you think twice about what the purpose of the car really is. Lexus \nCOCKPIT AND CABIN: \nWith a steering wheel littered with buttons, controls high up on the dash and a touch pad on the center console, the cockpit of the LC 500 feels more like a command center than the driver's seat of a car. This is tastefully accomplished without detracting from the standard Lexus luxury feel. The door panel armrests are a cozy alcantara and even the volume knob in the center console feels weighty, like something you’d find on a high-end home stereo system. \nDespite being a 2+2, the inside was roomier than expected, even if backseat passengers might feel quite cramped. Taller passengers may also struggle with headroom, which is limited to 37.2 inches with the standard glass roof and 36.8 inches with the carbon fiber roof panel, which you can get with the Sport package. Lexus \nMORE, PLEASE: \nLexus nailed the dichotomy between a driver's car and a daily driving comfort cruiser. In the Comfort and Eco modes, the LC 500 still gets up to speed in a hurry, but you can ease off the gas and enjoy a very comfortable ride. \nTwist the knob behind the right side of the steering wheel away from you and you will feel the full screaming power of the naturally-aspirated 5.0L V-8. In Sport S mode, downshifts become sharp and they crackle. Twist the knob away from you again to activate Sport S+. The tachometer turns from black to white and the numbers and redline enlarge. The baffles in the Active Exhaust also open fully and the car virtually begs for you to go faster. You have to oblige. \nLESS, PLEASE: \nLexus exhaustively focused on keeping everything neat and trim. Still, limited cargo space — something coupe owners are typically used to by now — will be a constant worry for drivers. To squeeze a teensy amount of additional space in the trunk, Lexus opted to fit the LC 500 with a set of 20-inch run flats instead of room for a spare. What you're left with is still a rather tiny trunk. Of course, you don't buy a coupe for the cargo space, but even the similarly sized Mercedes AMG C63 S Coupe packs double the trunk capacity. \nTHE FUTURE IS NOW: \nThe LC 500 comes with plenty of standard features such as lane keep assist, blind spot monitors and even a heads-up display (including a speedometer, speed limit and navigation) projected onto the windshield. \nOpt for a loaded version and you’re treated to fancy bells and whistles make you feel like you just hijacked Tony Stark's daily driver. The instrument panel is completely digital and customizable. When entering the settings menu for the console, the tachometer slides to the right to reveal a hidden display that's quick and easy to navigate with the controls on the steering wheel. \nThe center console isn't so easy to master. The touch pad, located directly in front of the cup holder (just asking to have a sticky drink sloshed onto it) is tricky to use. We struggled to figure out simple things, like how to turn on the ventilated seats. \nLET'S GET REAL: \nThe level of detail Lexus poured into the LC 500 is impressive, if not awe-inspiring. It went out of its way to ensure the swooping L logo can be found throughout the car's design. It can be found in the taillights, which exhibit a three-dimensional illusion that looks like a sequence of L-shapes that fade into the taillights. Even the patterned carbon fiber-like panel on the passenger-side dash is made of hundreds of tiny Ls. Lexus \nTo no surprise at all, this level of detail carries over into the driving experience. Through the steering wheel, you can feel everything . The steering is exceptionally tight. Little road noise seeps into the cabin, but there's the perfect amount of engine noise. Admittedly, we enjoyed the engine sound with the windows down a fair bit more. \nWhen you first start up the LC 500, the engine gives an unexpected roar. It sounded mean and aggressive, and then immediately withdrew itself to the quieter, default driving mode. Despite a slight hesitation when stepping on the pedal, it felt peppy from the moment we left the parking lot. The hybrid model felt quicker to power, but only after switching it to one of the Sport S modes, where the 5.0L V-8 truly shines. \nWe weren't expecting to be enamored with the hybrid variant, with which we also got some seat time. That 3.5L V-6 only puts out 354 horsepower and 256.7 lb-ft of twist. That's nearly 120 ponies less than the 8-cyl engine and nearly 141 lb-ft less torque. But the power difference wasn't so noticeable on the open road. \nAnother reason the V-8 won us over was the music it produced in Manual mode. The hybrid works to keep the barking of downshifts at bay, even in the Sport S+ mode. It's literally designed to take away some of the visceral aggression you get from the gas engine. While the hybrid was still a pleasure to drive, it lacked the excitement of its fully combustible counterpart. Lexus \nLet’s talk cornering. In the LC 500, tight corners could never get old. It sits quite low — a mere 5.2 inches off the ground — and has a wide stance of 75.6 inches. Paired with the active rear steering, this car whips around turns. For comparison, its wheelbase is nearly 10-inches longer than that of the Jaguar F-Type, but its turn radius is 8 percent shorter. \nAll the finite details aside, Lexus sent a message with the LC 500, and we received it loud and clear. The company is capable of making a luxury car that can perform just as well as the competition, one that's as comfortable as it is fun to drive, a car that you can take out to a classy dinner or for a winding road trip through the canyons. The Lexus LC 500 is adaptable, comfortable and fun as hell to drive. \nSCORECARD: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:03:33.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
