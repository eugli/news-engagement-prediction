Thus, I’ve decided to do a little digging and come up with a guide on crayfish dishes in Singapore, and it turns out that loads of places have now incorporated this yummy crustacean into their menus! Here are nine crayfish dishes to satisfy those cray cray cravings. 1. Crayfish White Bee Hoon, Xian Seafood Lala Beehoon Xian Seafood Lala Beehoon - Crayfish White Bee Hoon More Credit If you’re looking for good white bee hoon in Singapore, try Xian Seafood Lala Beehoon where they sell Crayfish White Bee Hoon ($20). What made this plate of bee hoon so special was that the bee hoon was initially fried for a firmer texture. It was then cooked in the pork bone and seafood broth. This results in super springy noodles in a light, sweet broth with crayfish, lala and bits of pork lard. The crayfish absorbed the essence of the broth and the sliced cabbage added an extra crunch to the overall dish. Xian Seafood Lala Beehoon: Blk 304, Ubi Ave 1, #01-103, Singapore 400304 | Opening Hours: (Mon to Sun) 11am – 3pm, 5pm – 9.30pm | Website 2. Indo Curry Crayfish Bee Hoon, Big Lazy Chop 大懶排 big lazy chop indo curry crayfish bee hoon 3 More Although called Indo Curry Crayfish Bee Hoon ($13/S, $19/M, $24/L), don’t be confused as this is not an Indonesian dish. The local flavours are amplified by the addition of sambal, which made the curry more fragrant. Be warned that it’s quite spicy though, especially when served piping hot. Instead of the usual thick curry broth, Big Lazy Chop’s version was more watery and less jelak . This is because the usual coconut milk is replaced with evaporated milk, resulting in a sweeter version. Besides the crayfish bee hoon , do try the signature Big Lazy Chop XL Ribs ($22 for four pieces) if you are dining there. Big Lazy Chop 大懶排: #01-04, 1A Short St, Singapore 188210 | Opening hours: (Tue to Sun) 11.30am – 2.30pm, 5.30pm – 10.30pm, Closed on Mon | Website 3. Crayfish Bee Hoon Soup, Sumo Big Prawn Noodle OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA More Famous for the lobster bee hoon soup, Sumo Big Prawn Noodle has been the talk of town for bringing quality food to the masses at affordable prices. Besides the lobsters, let’s not forget that they also serve tasty bowls of Crayfish Bee Hoon Soup ($13). The best part? Each bowl comes with three whole pieces of crayfish and tons of lala . The amount is so generous and is really a steal coming from a hawker stall. The taste of the broth was also less prawn-y and more flavourful as a result of the ingredients (pork bones and prawn shells) used to make the broth. Head there early if you want to skip the queues! Sumo Big Prawn Noodle: Blk 628 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4 #01-72, Singapore 560628 | Tel: 9299 2621 | Opening Hours: (Tue to Thurs) 8.30am – 9pm, (Fri) 8.30am – 9.30pm, (Sat to Sun): 9am – 9pm, Closed on Mon Read More 4. Linguine Al Cartoccio, Pietro Ristorante pietro ristorante Linguine al Cartoccio More I love seafood in Italian pasta and Pietro Ristorante serves an excellent version which includes crayfish. Pietro prides itself in its use of fresh ingredients and original homemade sauces. The price is definitely worth the quality. The Linguine al Cartoccio ($26) is a spicy crayfish pasta wrapped in parchment paper. Unravel it and indulge in an array of crayfish, scallops, clams, prawns and squid. The parchment paper keeps all the juices locked in, resulting in a dish that’s packed full of flavour. The restaurant is also famous for its woodfire pizzas, so make sure you bring a few friends and order loads to share.

Seafood Soup, Yan Ji Seafood Soup Crayfish-3 More Located near Woodlands Checkpoint, Woodlands Centre Food Court might seem out of the way for some, but hey, good food is worth the journey! For North-landers, this is truly a gem found. Priced at $6 and $8 for the Seafood Soup and $10 and $12 for the Fish Maw Seafood Soup , Yan Ji Seafood Soup is pretty wallet-friendly given the generous portion of ingredients. The bowl of crayfish, minced meat chunks, prawns and fish was definitely worth a second visit.

Spicy Seafood Stew, Masizzim Crayfish-4 Credit When I ordered the Spicy Seafood Stew ($36.80) from Masizzim, I was simply expecting the usual steaming pot of mussels, prawns, and squid mixed in a spicy Korean sauce. To my surprise, there was actually crayfish served as well! It was particularly comforting to enjoy this dish in the cold weather that day. There are four levels of spiciness to choose from and I of course went straight for level four. The seafood soaked up the sauce really well, especially the prawns and crayfish which were really tender too. A word of advice: try not to let it cook for too long as the broth will dry up fast. Masizzim: 313 Orchard Rd, #B3-02, Singapore 238895 | Tel: 6509 5808 | Opening Hours: (Daily) 11am – 10pm | Website 7. Crayfish Mac & Cheese, Morganfield’s Crayfish-1 More Ahh. .. Morganfield’s – the place famous for the sticky bones, sticky bones and sticky bones . Or ribs, to you and me. Go for the awesome flavour combinations such as the Garlic BBQ (Full $41.90, Half $21.90) or the classic Hickory BBQ (Full $41.90, Half $21.90). What you have to order on the side though is the Crayfish Mac & Cheese ($23.90). Mac & Cheese is pretty sinful as is, but then, crayfish chunks?? YES PLEASE. There is also a whole list of appetisers, salads and mains on the menu to choose from. Large families or big eaters can even opt for the sharing platters such as the Ocean Feast ($119.90) or The Carnivore ($98.90) . You will not leave hungry.

Seafood Platter , Woon Woon Pek Bee Hoon Woon Woon Pek Beehoon-14 More Ever heard of a Seafood Platter in a hawker centre for $30 ? At that price tag, you may wonder if it’s really worth your penny. We give it a huge resounding YES when you get a huge plate of seafood consisting of prawns, crayfish, fish slices and clams on a bed of white bee hoon . The sprinkle of fried pork lard on top added an extra crunch to the overall texture, with a broth that was sweet and packed full of flavour from all the seafood. The portion is great for sharing among three to four people, so grab a few kakis and make the pilgrimage to Changi.

Crayfish Fruit Juice Mee Siam, Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa Crayfish Credit Listed on the 2016 Michelin Guide, the Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa is popular among the locals for the light yet flavoursome laksa gravy. Prices start at $3 and you can upgrade to more ingredients and noodles. Besides laksa , you can also go for the mee siam or mee rebus version. Try the Crayfish Fruit Juice Mee Siam ($7), which is an interesting rendition of the usual laksa . It is filled with laksa ingredients but instead of the thick noodles, vermicelli is used instead. It comes with crayfish, which explains the higher price. This bowl is definitely worth the queue. Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa: Blk 531A Upper Cross Street, Hong Lim Market & Food Centre #02-66, Singapore 051531 | Opening Hours: (Mon to Sat) 10.30am – 6pm, Closed on Sun", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:48:18.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
