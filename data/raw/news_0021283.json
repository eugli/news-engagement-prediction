A Republican bill would increase gas taxes, add a $15 vehicle registration fee and a $150 electric car fee. Ryan Martin / IndyStar The Republicans at the Statehouse are right. It’s time to raise taxes for infrastructure.

And I’m not even talking about Donald Trump. \nConsider this: I’m a left-leaning guy who is among the many supporting a quest by conservative Statehouse Republicans to raise taxes for infrastructure amid suggestions from House Democrats that our road, bridge and other problems can be fixed not with new tax revenue, but in part by tightening our belts. \nYes, Republicans are fighting for tax increases. And Democrats are acting as if that’s a crime . It’s almost as if the two parties are sending out the others’ news releases. \nIs anyone else’s head spinning? \nIf not, consider this: Republican state leaders have been openly calling for these tax increases during an era in which many of their voters are furious with government, but other than House Democrats and a special-interest group or two, nobody seems to be complaining. After so many years in which politicians dared not speak of tax hikes, there is a noticeable lack of unmanufactured Hoosier outrage in this case. \nIt’s refreshing. But it still begs the question: Why? I suspect the shoulder-shrug of a reaction can be credited to two things. \nFirst, the goal behind the tax push is to improve Indiana’s infrastructure. It doesn’t get more basic than that. Even the loudest anti-government voices would have to admit that there is value in taking care of nuts-and-bolts obligations such as our highways, streets, ports and bridges. That message is even more appealing in a state that likes to call itself the Crossroads of America, and whose economy benefits from the ability to easily transport stuff in and out. \nSecond, raising gas taxes to pay for roads and other infrastructure is a sensible notion that’s quite easy for politicians to defend. Nobody likes taxes — nobody I’ve ever met, at least — but it’s easier to sell them when those taxes undeniably help the payer. \nIf you know that the taxes you’re paying at the pump, where prices already jump and dip with regularity, will make the drive you’re about to make easier — well, that’s not such a bitter pill. Moreover, the likely companion tax increase proposal, to raise cigarette taxes, is a wildly popular one (at least as far as tax increase proposals go). Hiking the cost of a pack of cigarettes not only encourages people to quit, and provides those who want to quit with another incentive, it will also raise upfront cash and save taxpayers money in the future in areas such as Medicaid. \nSo count this left-leaning Hoosier among those hoping our conservative Republican state lawmakers can overcome the objections of Democrats and raise taxes this year. Given the GOP supermajority, that shouldn’t be a problem. \nThe GOP gas tax plan would provide an adult response to a serious challenge. It would not only raise roughly a billion dollars a year to tackle backlogged infrastructure projects, it also would put in place a lasting funding plan so that we can stop with all the Band Aid strategies. It would also allow Indiana to invest more in trails and transit, as well as 21st Century challenges such as rural broadband. \nAlong with a group lobbying for gas stations , a far-right interest group has provided much of the opposition to the plan. Americans for Prosperity, which fights initiatives such as a decent minimum wage, has argued that the 10-cents-per-gallon increase would be “a tremendous and unnecessary burden for Hoosier families.” \nWe can debate whether this tax increase, estimated to cost the average driver about $50 a year, is “tremendous.” But it’s definitely not unnecessary. And let’s not forget that this proposal comes after years of tax cuts that have left the same GOP lawmakers who supported them, with a push from Americans for Prosperity, now in need of new funding sources. \nAgain, it’s head-spinning. \nIn the end, this debate comes down to one issue: We need to have an adult debate about our state’s infrastructure needs and condition. We need to acknowledge that when it comes to our infrastructure the status quo is unacceptable, and that a long-term, sustainable plan makes sense. And we have to stop arguing, as some critics are, that we can solve this problem by dipping into a one-time pool of money such as the state surplus. \nRaising taxes is not fun. But this is a smart tax increase that will pay off down the road. Statehouse Republicans, after so many years of playing politics with tax rhetoric, deserve credit for leading the debate this year. They might have our heads spinning, but they are doing the right thing. \nThank you for reading.
