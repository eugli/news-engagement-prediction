The bird had a broken wing that could not be fixed and was later euthanized.\nBy Steve Annear Globe Staff February 09, 2017\nA bald eagle that enjoyed a few moments of Internet fame after a photograph of the stoic bird blocking a doughnut shop’s drive-through went viral this week was euthanized by veterinarians due to a severe injury that couldn’t be fixed.\nOn Monday, Heav’nly Donuts, in Methuen, shared an image of the bird perched on the curb near where customers order food and coffee.\nAdvertisement\nIn the photograph, which was taken by John R. McCarthy , of JRM Photography, the eagle is seen staring quizzically at the smorgasbord of food items and specialty coffee drinks. Heav’nly Donuts posted a tongue-in-cheek message accompanying the picture.\n“Sorry for the long line at drive thru this afternoon!,” the company wrote. “This bald eagle couldn’t decide which doughnut he wanted!”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

It also received more than 6,000 Facebook reactions ranging from surprised to amused.\nBut the tale of the bird that briefly captured the hearts of Methuen-ites and residents around the state ended badly.\nAccording to a Taraneh Pettinato, a spokeswoman for Tufts Wildlife Clinic at Cummings Veterinary Medical Center at Tufts University, the eagle was transported from Methuen to the animal hospital Monday by the Massachusetts Environmental Police.\nAdvertisement\nPettinato said in an e-mail to the Globe that the bird was severely emaciated, and had a broken wing that didn’t heal properly, leaving it flightless.\nFlorina Tseng, director of the clinic, said in a statement that the fracture was beyond repair. After a careful assessment, veterinarians decided to euthanize the bird.\n“We had concerns about the chronic pain it would cause the bird,” Tseng said. “Our goal is always to treat and release, but given the condition of the bird upon arrival, this sadly was not possible.”\nUpon hearing the news of the its death, people who had been bemused by its presence at a doughnut store’s drive-through window mourned the loss of a majestic bird.\n“At least he passed with loving caretakers surrounding him,” one person wrote.\nBald eagles have been known to live and hunt along the Merrimack River , which straddles Methuen.\nIn April, with the help of volunteers, MassWildlife officials conducted a statewide bald eagle nesting survey, checking known nests and documenting new eagle nesting locations, according to the department’s website.\nAt the time of the survey, officials said the results of the count were “very encouraging,” as workers observed a “growing population of eagles.”\nIn 2015, there were a confirmed 51 territorial breeding bald eagle pairs documented statewide. It was the largest number of identified pairs since 1982, when the birds of prey were reintroduced to Massachusetts.\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com .
