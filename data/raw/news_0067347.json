In essence, Nigeria’s Constitution grants the president the power to withhold assent to a bill within thirty days of receipt. \nBut upon presidential veto as exercised by Mr. Osinbajo, section 58(5) provides that such bill automatically becomes law if it is passed again by two-thirds majority of each of the chambers. \nIt is not the first time a veto would be exercised. Last year, President Muhammadu Buhari refused to assen t to the initial version of the 2016 Appropriation Bill passed by the National Assembly. \nBefore Mr. Buhari, former President Goodluck Jonathan had at the twilight of his tenure in 2015 refused to assent to the Constitution Amendment Bill 2015 passed by the National Assembly, pointing to some anomalies. \nMeanwhile, Mr. Osinbajo had days ago signed seven bills into law. \nEditor’s Note: This post has been updated to reflect the actual number of bills vetoed by the Acting President.
