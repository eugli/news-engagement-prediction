(Bridget Yard/CBC)\nThe meal comes after a tense two weeks for many Muslims. First, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning travel from several majority Muslim nations, including Syria. Then, six Muslims were shot to death at a mosque in Quebec City just days later. \nAli M'halla said the support he's received from the community made it important to give back. \n\"The difficult moments make you awake and think about others too,\" said Ali M'halla. \n\"We receive a lot of solidarity and support from Moncton and New Brunswick communities. We say, why not as a Muslim New Brunswicker, what can we do to say thanks?\" \nRaymonde Robichaud, town councillor for Tracadie, was thankful for the support. (Bridget Yard/CBC)\nRaymonde Robichaud, a town councillor for Tracadie, which includes Sainte-Rose, was at a loss for words. \n\"I feel very ... yup ... no words about that. A lot, a lot of ... my god. Thank you,\" said Robichaud. \nAli M'halla hopes this will be a first step in creating stronger ties in the community. \n\"It was a first and not the last action to build this bridge between community, and it's very important for our society to do something to make people close and to develop our community,\" said Ali M'halla. \nWith files from Bridget Yard", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:59:21.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
