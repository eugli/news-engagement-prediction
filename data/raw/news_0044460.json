Picture: John Gass \nIn the 44-4 trial loss to Brisbane before a crowd of more than 3000 on Saturday night, Brideson played Mathew Seamark in the No. 6 jersey, with former Cowboy Travis Burns as his halves partner. \nHe said, however, he had yet to decide if they would remain as his pairing going forward. \nBrideson is also yet to name a replacement captain for Templeman. \n“We haven’t really settled on our halves,” he said. “Losing a player of Patty’s calibre is always tough but I’m certainly very comfortable with the players we have in our squad.’’ \nBrideson’s other option in the halves is Broncos-affiliate Mitch Cronin. \nWhile Cronin usually plays at hooker, he can slot into the halves if need be. \nWynnum Manly will begin their campaign against Souths Logan on Sunday week. \nMeanwhile, a number of Intrust Super Cup clubs have profited from hosting NRL trials at their grounds over the past month. \nSunshine Coast drew the biggest numbers last week when 10,169 turned out to watch the Storm take on the Warriors. \nRedcliffe also drew in 6500 for the Broncos and Sharks meeting in the first weekend of the month, with all proceeds going to the junior development program. \nIpswich had more than 4000 people turn out for last week’s Broncos trial against the Jets.
