ATHLETICS SOUTHLAND \nSouthland shot putter Kunal Trehan won the shot put at the Southland Athletics Championships in Invercargill. \nTrehan, who is also competing in the shot put at the New Zealand Championships, had to put out a 76cm PB to head off his younger opponent. \nHowever, Welsh was not to be headed in the other throws, taking the hammer with 35.43m, discus 41.80m and javelin 44.25m. \nThe shot put and discus will be his events at the national champs. \nThe Southland shot putters will be up against Tom Walsh and Jacko Gill in Hamilton and have no illusions about giving the Olympians a hurry up, but they both look forward to the experience of competing with and against two of the world's best throwers. \nAnna Skerrett (15) impressed with her shot put of 12.32m, her second best mark ever, while Emma Ryan who has graduated to the heavier U20 weight shot had 10.37m. \nBoth are ranked highly nationally in their respective grades. \nDyani Shepherd Oates had the best women's hammer throw of 42 metres. \nThe Fiordland 17-year-old is currently ranked third in the country in the WU18 event. \nThe outstanding sprinter of the championship title must surely go to 15-year-old Dannika Collins who dominated the women's 100 and 200 metres, posting a slick 12.85s in the shorter event and 26.36s for the 200m. \nIt was no surprise Atipa Mabonga won the triple jump with the national secondary school champion and record holder recording a wind assisted 11.75m. \nShe followed this up with a 5.73m winning long jump at the Otago Championships the next day, and while wind assisted it is her best mark so far this season. \nWinton club members Jack Beaumont, Liam Turner and Anton Schroder were also in winning form at the Otago Championships. \nBeaumont convincingly won the senior 3000m in 8:38.62, Schroder the javelin with 49.63m and Turner the 400m in a PB 50.06 and 800m in 1:57.48 while Gore's Emma Hopcroft took out the WU20 long jump, measuring 5.32m. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:19:40.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
