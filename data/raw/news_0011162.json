Em went deep into the Slim Shady chamber and held back nothing in his verbal assault, which Coulter said is nothing more than a violent attack against women. \nCoulter, an unpopular figure by those on the liberal side of things, was approached by TMZ and said this current display is yet another instance where the veteran MC has used his platform to promote violence and hate against women. \nEminem certainly did go for the proverbial jugular, as he’s done many times in his long career. \nHere’s the passage in question (via Genius): \nThat’s for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando \n“He talks about f-ing women with an umbrella until the bleep comes out,” Coulter said to TMZ. “This goes on for years. He denounces gays, using ugly terms. His homophobia and misogyny is quite well known.” \nCoulter couldn’t resist using the moment to take another swipe at the left and said that those who stand on that side have, along with Em, “normalized violence against women,” and other sweeping points. She said that this behavior of hate extends to protesters at UC Berkeley and the chief of the Berkeley Police Department in saying the left is promoting “violent ways.” \nPresident Donald Trump also caught some strays from Em, who called him “a bitch” later in the verse. \nWatch Ann Coulter’s comments on Eminem and the left in the clip above.
