(Chuck Burton/AP)  23 AM \n“Once a Knick, always a Knick” always has been a pick-and-choose slogan at the Garden anyway, but its accompanying social-media hashtag — yes, #OAKAAK — never seemed sillier than during Wednesday night’s embarrassing fiasco involving team legend Charles Oakley. \nYou almost half-expect the Knicks to call it something else now just out of sheer pettiness. \nThe handling of Oakley’s first-quarter expulsion from the arena and his subsequent arrest for getting into it with MSG security was the latest and among the lowest of all of the unseemly moments for the Knicks this season and for James Dolan’s ownership group over the past two decades. \nSome reported eyewitness accounts had Oakley smelling of alcohol and being boisterous and belligerent a few rows behind Dolan’s baseline seat — a charge the former power forward strongly denied in an exclusive phone interview with incomparable News columnist Frank Isola after he was released from the police station late Wednesday night, and then again in a video interview posted the next morning by a local restaurant. \nIt’s certainly hard to argue that Oak getting physical with cops and/or security personnel who were just following orders and/or trying to do their jobs didn’t warrant his removal. \nStill, a friend who works in public relations texted me Wednesday night and wondered: “You would think they (MSG PR) would have realized the value in having (Dolan) step up and just say ‘don’t arrest him.’ Would have been a big P.R. win.” \nMy response to that, of course, was “what are you new here?” \nThe Garden always has been about THEIR spin, and certainly not P.R. victories, as evidenced by their insistence to this day that Isiah Thomas and MSG were exonerated in Anucha Browne Sanders’ 2007 sexual harassment case, despite her winning an $11.6 million judgment. \nNo, they instead immediately issued a statement Wednesday night with their version of events, which concluded with them suggesting Oakley “was a great Knick and we hope he gets some help soon.” Even if true, it was “despicable” for them to go there, as Isola and others properly noted right away on Twitter. \nBut back to the “Once a Knick” thing for a minute, a silly exercise that for every Patrick Ewing acknowledgement also puts the likes of Baron Davis — with 29 career appearances with the team — on the MSG scoreboard whenever he attends a game. \nMeanwhile, remember that Jeff Van Gundy was overlooked for years and years after resigning as head coach 19 games into the 2001-02 season, until he finally was recognized on the scoreboard while working a game on TV this past December. Former Knick Charles Oakley exchanges words with a security guard. (Frank Franklin II/AP) \nSimilarly, Tiki Barber was persona non grata with the Giants upon his retirement after a few incidents, including taking some public shots at Tom Coughlin and Eli Manning. Yogi Berra stayed away from Yankee Stadium for 14 years — albeit, his decision, not the team’s — after George Steinbrenner unceremoniously fired him after just 16 games in 1985. \nJoe Namath also has engaged in his public spats with the Jets. And Hall of Famer Pat LaFontaine stayed away from the Islanders for several years after a falling out with owner Charles Wang and GM Garth Snow. \nAs for Oakley, he definitely has taken his share of public shots at Dolan and the organization through the years. But he swore on his mother to Isola that he “didn’t say anything to (Dolan)” Wednesday night and then further explained in the morning-after video that he felt “threatened” during his brush with security. \n“Somebody walking up on you, you gotta protect yourself in all matters,” Oakley said. “I’ve been in situation like this before, I’ve been jumped before. In my mind, I was thinking like, if you got 7-8-9-10 guys walking up on you, you have to brace and be ready for the challenge. So that’s what I’m thinking. If somebody, more than two or three people walking up to you, yeah, threatened, yes.” \nAs for his status now moving forward at MSG, Oakley added: “I don’t know no status, but you know what, as long as the fans care about me, I love the fans and I’m always going to love the fans. I’m a Knicks fan for life, no matter if I go back to the Garden or not, I’m still going to cheer for the Knicks. Because I played here for a decade, my heart and soul are here. I know people loved the way I played and I really appreciate it. I wasn’t the best player, but I came out and played every night and that’s what they want to see, you play with heart and effort.” \nKnicks fans doubtlessly would do anything to have a blood-and-guts player like Oakley on the current squad. But in his case, OAK sadly no longer stands for the first half of “Once a Knick, always a Knick.” OUTTA BOTTE EXPERIENCE \n— You know how you also can tell the good old days are gone for good at The Garden? Oakley’s fight couldn’t even spark the Knicks to a victory over the Clippers. \nBut at least it distracted us away from the Phil-Carmelo pending split for about 20 minutes. We now return to our regularly scheduled programming. \n— Once and for all, fans of the Jets and the Islanders and the two baseball teams can think all they want that their teams often are a dysfunctional mess. \nThe Knicks still can trump all of them – pun intended – whenever they want. \n— Kurt Warner celebrated his HOF induction by taking the family to Burger King. And you thought Terrell Owens’ omission was the Whopper revelation of the weekend. (Don’t worry, I was fully booing myself for that one before I even typed it). PETE’S PICKS \nFor those who didn’t get to see much of Oakley’s career, today’s Top-5 lists some of his most memorable on-court battles. \n5. P.J.
