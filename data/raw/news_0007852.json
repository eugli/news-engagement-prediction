The ad also previews a slew of special guest stars that will appear on the upcoming fifth season, including Martha Stewart and Michelle Obama. \nAnd if the new lyrics sound like they fit the song just right, that’s because the song’s original writer, Martin Charnin, contributed to the tune. \nWatch the adorable clip above, and make note of the fact that yes, there is dabbing. \nMasterChef Junior premieres Thursday, Feb. 9 at 8 p.m. ET on Fox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:17:09.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
