Be ready to move the ball and move people. We ain't trying to go to the basket unless we have a wide open layup. Move the ball,'\" McAliley said. \nThe Millers answered with 10 straight points, helped by three Poly turnovers. Pollard and Jone Ayers, who finished with 17 points each, each hit a 3-pointer and a short bucket to boost the lead to 47-36. Milford finished the quarter on a 15-1 run, taking a 52-37 lead on Hughes' three-point play. \nPollard said her team seized the momentum thanks to, \"Everybody's encouragement. We just had to keep it going. Once we got it going, we all got going.\" \nPoly came roaring back to start the final quarter. The Engineers opened the quarter with a nine-point run. Galloway had two terrific assists in that run, including one off a steal to pull her team within 52-46 with 5:06 left. \nMcAliley called another timeout and Ayers stopped the Poly momentum with a driving layup. \nThe Engineers rallied again when Porter hit a layup and Deierra Weems added two free throws to cut the Millers' lead to 56-52. Poly appeared to cut the lead to two when Galloway hit Porter for a layup, but Porter was called for traveling. \nAyers scored the next five points, and the Engineers began fouling. The Millers hit seven of nine free throws in the final 58 seconds. \nThe Millers, who won back-to-back state championships in 2014 and 2015, will forget about their celebration and begin focusing on Franklin, a fellow Baltimore County team they did not play during the regular season. \n\"On to the next one. On to the next one. We just keep playing,\" Pollard said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T06:01:52.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
