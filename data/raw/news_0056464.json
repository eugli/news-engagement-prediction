She had been there before and it was an environment where her mother felt she was safe. Megan was due to stay the night but came home around midnight because she was feeling sick. Megan (pictured) had been out with friends and drank around half of the three-litre bottle over five hours during a New Year’s Eve party at a friend’s house She seemed well at around midnight, when she was texting her friends happy new year. Her mother stayed with her to make sure she was sat upright and when she was asleep, put her into the recovery position when she started trying to lie on her back. But when she settled down, Joanne went downstairs. But when she went to check on her the next morning, New Year’s Day 2014, she was dead. In 2015, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham wants to outlaw 'high-strength, ultra-low-priced white ciders' sold in three litre bottles. The drink is available in three-litre bottles for as little as £3.49 and contains the equivalent amount of alcohol as 22 shots of vodka Mr Burnham told MailOnline products like Frosty Jacks, White Ace and White Strike were fuelling under-age binge drinking and alcohol addiction and needed to be tackled. The Labour frontbencher said the high-strength ciders were cheaper than they used to be – meaning children could 'cobble together' enough money to get drunk all nights of the week. He said children as young as '11 or 12' were regularly boozing after school in a way their parents' generation would not have been able to afford. Many ciders available at pocket money prices have an alcohol content of 7.5 per cent – well above the strength of mainstream cider products – costing as little as 20p a unit. He said the cost and strength of cider made it 'very attractive to under-age drinkers, and it is also a major drink of choice for addicts and street drinkers'. Mr Burnham told MailOnline: 'These cider products are particularly used by children because of their low price and high strength. 'We've worked it out at 20p a unit. We're talking about which can be up to 7.5 per cent in strength but are retailing at £1.99 or less – and this is a two or three litre bottle. 'Young people can cobble together the money to get hold of them. 'What we are trying to signal [is that] coming in with a sledgehammer approach and just hitting everybody – that just loses people. They think why is everyone being punished – what's fair about that?' He added that the proposal was 'the start of the road'.
