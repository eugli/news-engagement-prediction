Flynn, the national security adviser, during a news conference on Monday. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times To the Editor: Re “ Facing Scrutiny Over Russia Call, Flynn Steps Down ” (front page, Feb. 14): While the focus of the next few news cycles will undoubtedly and deservedly fall on Michael Flynn, the media and our representatives must not let him become a scapegoat for the administration. If Mr. Flynn contacted Russian officials before the current administration took office, on whose behalf did he do so? Ongoing investigations into Russian interference cannot be allowed to dissipate. If any other administration officials were involved, the public deserves to know. President Trump has already shown that he will silence all criticism if he can, so Congress alone must act. Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, along with security-minded Republicans such as Senator John McCain, must publicly and forcefully demand further investigations. Our national security depends on it. ZACHARY MARGULIES New York To the Editor: The debacle of Michael Flynn’s resignation as national security adviser could have easily been avoided had Republican senators exercised greater input. His appointment should have never been allowed. The confirmation process actually does the president a favor when it works the way it is supposed to.

Were it not for her bringing it up to government officials repeatedly, this issue could have been easily swept aside. We can all take a page out of Ms. Yates’s book — stick to your principles and push them forward. She has demonstrated this on two paramount issues within the last few weeks and even lost her job over her refusal to defend the Muslim travel ban.
