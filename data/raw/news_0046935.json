If we look back 20 years ago and compare it with today how we communicate and do business; most people will agree it made life easier in most aspects. \nAll businesses today make use of at least one type of internet media to do business or to communicate with to their clients or suppliers. \nHenk Olivier, Managing Director of Ozone Information Technology solutions , looks at classified information technology in two segments, segment one internal network security, and segment two external network security. \nMany enterprises think if they have a firewall for the internet connection they are secure against IT threats. But what about your internal business threats? \nEmployees downloading or surfing unsolicited material, infecting your network with spyware, viruses or ransomware. \nOr employees stealing intellectual property, selling it to opposition, or stealing customer base to use in their next job opportunity as clients. These are large risks especially to medium and large enterprise companies with many employees. \nThese are large risks especially to medium and large enterprise companies with many employees. \nThe question is; how do I keep utilising technology in my business and not have a risk on employee productivity because of internet surfing and social media, or business security threads. \nStatistics today shows that the average time a person between the age of 18 -34 spends on social media is around 3 hours per day. \nThe biggest problem for businesses is to provide employees with all the tools they need in the workplace, but also to control employees when they using all the tools. \nFrom 15 years experience in information technology security solutions, Henk Olivier has seen that you need to create controlled structures and processes in businesses to protect the business and to improve productivity. \nYou need to provide employees with the tools, but also have the fences and limits when they are using the tools. \nThere are many software and hardware packages today monitoring and managing internal and external business networks and managing and monitoring employees in the workplace. Where do I start? \nIf you are a business which is not large enough to have its own internal IT department, make sure you consult a company with a good reputation. And always call references, call companies in the same industry. Who can I trust? \nIf you are a SME, make sure that the company who is going to provide your IT security is aware of the companies IT risks and normal operational risks in the business. Don’t use a company that cannot provide you with a customer signed agreement, never use a company that just works on verbal negotiations, agreements or solutions. How will I know it is best for my business/network? \nUnfortunately the only way to know if it is the best solution to the business is if you don’t have any IT security breaches. Always consult more than one provider, this is especially for businesses with internal IT departments, get a external company to audit your internal and external IT security state. When do I outsource, or when do I use internal support staff? \nThere are many factors that can contribute to this decision, if it comes to IT security, I always suggest to use a company that specializes in IT security and cyber security. \nFor more information, visit the Ozone website .
