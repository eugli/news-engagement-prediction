Those numbers were taken as of Dec. 2016.\nPrince said the annual rates right now are not enough to cover living expenses.\n\"The rate now for a year is a little over $11,500,\" he explained.\n\"I'm looking at getting that up to the neighbourhood of $19,000, or $19,500. To get there, that means a steady, not immodest amount of money — $50 million to $150 million each year — incrementally invested through two governments and eight budgets.\"\nThe provincial government did increase the rates in Sept. 2016 , but many critics said the increases were not sufficient.\nPrince said the major problem for those who rely on disability assistance is the rates aren't indexed and are vulnerable to inflation.\n\"The last rate increase before Sept. 2016 was back in 2007/2008. Between then and last fall, inflation ate away a significant chunk of the true purchasing power of the benefit, a third of it. The increase last fall did not compensate for all that loss.\"\nPrince said while the government's 2024 objects were laudable, \"specific steps\" need to be taken to meet its targets.\nWith files from The Early Edition", "external_links": ["http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/accessibility"], "published": "2017-02-10T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:02:45.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
