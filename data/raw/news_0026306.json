Supplied Photo: Supplied \nThe group of coalition, Labor MPs and an independent recommended the government examine ways to promote decentralisation, seek proposals for a high-speed rail network and investigate options for private funding through value capture. \nIt also suggested the government, in conjunction with the states and territories, keep an eye on the development of Hyperloop – a supersonic transport system – and, when appropriate, assess its feasibility. \n“This plan of urban renewal and decentralisation, facilitated by strategic planning of infrastructure, will deliver an abundant affordable housing supply for generations to come,” Mr Alexander said. \nThe current XPT rail link between Sydney and Melbourne – which the fourth busiest flight route in the world – takes around 11 hours. \nHigh speed rail has been floated as an infrastructure project in Australia since the early 1980s, with the prospect of decreasing commute times, decentralising the working population and developing regional centres all proving enticing. \nA high-speed train travelling at 350 kilometres an house would take three hours from Sydney to Melbourne. \nAlternatively a journey between the two cities on a Hyperloop system could apparently be as quick as 50 minutes. \nDeveloped by the Hyperloop One company in Los Angeles and originally conceived by inventor and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, the full Hyperloop concept is due to be tested in the first quarter of this year. \nThe system would be have pods floating in reduced-pressure tube on an air cushion, using magnets, rather than traditional carriages, dramatically cutting down on travel time. \nWith Nicole Frost", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:36:26.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
