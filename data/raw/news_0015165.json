Unbundling the cost \nMaybe you simply switch to the airline ticket price once more people start flying than sailing. \nBut flying is a different service - faster, more convenient. \nIf more travellers are willing to pay twice as much to fly, it hardly makes sense for inflation statistics to record that the cost of the journey has suddenly doubled. \nIt was to raise this question over the way we measure inflation that Bill Nordhaus started fooling around with wood fires, oil lamps and light meters. Image copyright iStock Image caption Prof Nordhaus found the Roman oil lamp offered much better light \nHe wanted to unbundle the cost of a single quality that humans have cared deeply about since time immemorial, using the state-of-the-art technology of different ages: illumination. \nLight is measured in lumens, or lumen-hours. \nA candle gives off 13 lumens while it burns. \nA typical modern light bulb is almost 100 times brighter than that. Prohibitively expensive \nImagine gathering and chopping wood 10 hours a day for six days. \nThose 60 hours of work would produce 1,000 lumen hours of light. \nThat is the equivalent of one modern light bulb shining for just 54 minutes, although what you would actually get is many more hours of dim, flickering light instead. \nOf course, light is not the only reason to burn fires: they also help keep you warm, cook your food and scare off wild animals. \nIf you just needed light and a wood fire was your only option, you might decide to wait until the Sun comes up. \nThousands of years ago, better options came along - candles from Egypt and Crete, and oil lamps from Babylon. \nTheir light was steadier and more controllable, but still prohibitively expensive. \nIn a diary entry of May 1743, the president of Harvard University, the Reverend Edward Holyoake, noted that his household had spent two days making 78lb (35kg) of tallow candles. \nSix months later, he noted: \"Candles all gone.\" \nAnd those were the summer months.
