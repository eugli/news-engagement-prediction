Iranian-American engineer Anousheh Ansari accepted the Oscar on Farhadi’s behalf, reading a speech that criticized the President’s “inhumane law.” Perhaps the biggest round of applause yet #oscars pic.twitter.com/LXRJ2hBewj — Cosmopolitan (@Cosmopolitan) February 27, 2017 Here's a full transcript of the speech: It’s a great honor to be receiving this valuable award for the second time. I would like to thank the members of the Academy, my crew in Iran, my producer Alexandre Mallet-Guy, Cohen media, Amazon, and my fellow nominees in the foreign film category.

These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression. Filmmakers can turn their cameras to capture shared human qualities and break stereotypes of various nationalities and religions.
