Cristiano Ronaldo overcomes video referee call and fires Real Madrid into final \nThe Premier League has taken a backseat on live trials with bosses believed to be sceptical about the use of a video assistant referee (VAR). \nKeep up to date with ALL the latest football news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club pages plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nBut former Prem referee David Elleray, who is now technical director of the International FA Board (Ifab), insists tests have allowed several issues to be ironed out. \nSpeaking to the Times, he said: “We are very happy with the progress that has been made. \n“We have gone from almost nothing to more than a dozen countries, and we have already found out what we can do better. AP:Associated Press Club America defenders can then be seen appealing for offside Reuters 3 After around a minute of confusion surrounded Ronaldo's goal at Club World Cup \n“One or two things did not go so well at first but it would be a great shame if people get the idea that it is not going to work. \n“So far we are very happy with how the tests have gone and the fact that so many of the major footballing countries want to be part of the experiment shows we are moving in the right direction. \n“It has so far worked better than a lot of people have anticipated. If the trials go well, Fifa would like to have the option to use it for the World Cup next year. \n“England are also following this closely and may well become part of it in the future.” \nSome trials have seen the referee being allowed to view a replay on a tablet by the side of the pitch, while others have allowed the VAR to rule on decisions from the sidelines. Getty Images Former Premier League David Elleray says trails have ironed out issues \nManagers and players are not allowed to challenge decisions. \nCristiano Ronaldo criticised the system after he was forced to wait almost a minute for a goal to be awarded during this season’s Club World Cup as the referee signalled he was checking for an offside. \nElleray claimed that was due to a mix-up between referees, adding: \"That is what these tests are for — to flag up potential problems. In terms of correcting unfairness, nothing else will be able to do that and that is the attraction for most. \n\"Accuracy is more important than speed. Some people say it takes too long but that can be because the referees are not used to it. There are already often lengthy delays.” \nMore countries, including Germany, France, the USA, Belgium, Portugal, Czech Republic, Mexico and Qatar are also planning to take part in live trials next season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T13:54:41.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
