Mystery donor offers £150,000 to pay for boy's life-saving cancer treatment \nHe posted an image of Adolf Hitler along with the message ‘kill the Muslims’ online and was blocked by Facebook, which he referred to as ‘Jewbook’ more than 300 times. \nProsecutor Jonathan Sandiford told the court: ‘The defendant was a committed racist, a member of the National Front. \n‘He was enthralled by Nazism and Adolf Hitler whom he told police in his interviews was his God.’ He seems a delightful chap (Picture: Central) \nCreighton also had an electronic document entitled ‘White Resistance Manual 2.4’ which contains details of shotguns, improvised weapons and explosives, and harassment. \nMr Sandiford described it as a ‘complete guide on how to prepare for and conduct a terrorist campaign’. Corbyn facing tough by-election test as voters head to the polls \nAuthors of the document said they want to exacerbate existing tensions, to smash Jewish power and influence, destroy the legitimacy of government and punish white people who have committed acts of treason against their own people. \nCreighton, of Enfield, north London, has pleaded guilty to eight offences, including a terror charge of collecting information which could be useful to someone committing or preparing an act of terrorism. \nHe has also pleaded guilty to six counts of publishing or distributing materials that were likely to stir up racial hatred and a further count of possession of racially inflammatory materials. He will be sentenced later today (Picture: Central) \nThe court was told that Creighton’s actions showed links to and support for various groups such as neo-Nazi organisation Combat 18, National Action and Aryan Strikeforce. \nAmong the other posts he put on social media is an image of a gun alongside a Swastika and the words ‘Jews prepare to die’. \nCreighton also posted an image of an injured man alongside words intended to stir hatred of sexual orientation as well as a cartoon of a head in a noose, the court heard. \nHe also had stickers from Combat 18 with the text ‘sink the refugee boats!’. \nCreighton also posted a ‘threatening, abusive or insulting’ image of a man holding a rifle in front of a black child. \nThe court was told that Creighton posted material to his 692 followers and that he had suggested no harm was done because he was contacting people who had similar views. \nJudge Peter Lodder QC, the honorary Recorder of Richmond Upon Thames, adjourned the hearing until 10am on Thursday when Creighton will appear in custody for sentencing.
