Many also came in to use the hospital toilets and there were some who were rude to the hospital security guards. \n“I appeal for the public to cooperate and avoid using the park-ing meant for hospital visitors for the sake of our patients and staff. Please keep to the designated parking lots and facilities which have been provided for by the fiesta organisers,” he said yesterday. \nMeanwhile, the Polo Ground was abuzz with activities as visitors poured into the field to take part in the two-day fiesta. \nThe two-day festival, which ends today, features 12 hot air balloons, which include seven special balloon shapes – Simba, Rooster, Octopus, Heart, Hatching Egg, Happy Flame and Wasp.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:24:26.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
