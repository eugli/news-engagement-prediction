Dolan says the firing of the security head stemmed from more than just the handling of the Oakley incident.\nDolan says that games must remain safe for fans, and for that reason, \"We are going to put the ban in place and hopefully it won't be forever.\"\nThe Knicks distributed a witness report earlier Friday featuring more than a dozen witnesses from throughout the arena who described what the Knicks have called Oakley's \"abusive\" behavior.\n© The Associated Press Madison Square Garden Executive Chairman James Dolan reacts to an altercation between the Charles Oakley and security guards during the first half of an NBA basketball game between the New York Knicks and the LA Clippers, Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2017, in New York.
