WARWICK SMITH/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe Maori Party and Mana Party welcomed on to Ratana together. From left; Mana Party leader Hone Harawira, Maori Party candidate for Te Tai Hauauru Howie Tamati, Maori Party co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell and Maori Party president Tuku Morgan. \nThe Maori Party's candidate in Te Tai Tokerau won more than 2500 votes at the last election, so giving Harawira a clear run would put the pressure on Davis. \nREAD MORE: \nBut Davis isn't sweating over the agreement and says the \"whole landscape has changed\" in Te Tai Tokerau. DAVID WHITE/ FAIRFAX NZ \nLabour's Te Tai Tokerau MP Kelvin Davis narrowly won the seat from Mana leader Hone Harawira in 2014. \n\"They're welcome to each other.\" \n\"A vote for Mana now is a vote for the National Party and I think the people of Te Tai Tokerau will see that,\" he said. \nThree years on Davis says he's much more confident he'll win especially after his work in the corrections portfolio, including \"a Minister losing his job and Serco losing its contract\". DOMINICO ZAPATA/FAIRFAX NZ \nLabour MP Peeni Henare's Tamaki Makaurau seat is under threat with a unified Maori vote between Mana and the Maori Party. \nDavis was the driving force behind revelations around fight clubs and contraband in Serco-run prisons, which saw then-Corrections Minister Sam Lotu-Iiga come under fire and Corrections take over the running of Mt Eden prison. Ad Feedback \nBoth Harawira and Maori Party president Tuku Morgan have agreed they need to stop splitting the Maori vote if they're going to have a chance of winning the seats back. \n\"Māori disunity gifted the Māori seats to Labour in 2014 and it's time for us to bring all the seats home to kaupapa Māori parties so we can hold the balance of power in Parliament and ensure a strong voice in government, regardless of which major party rules,\" Morgan said. \nWHAT DOES A UNITED MAORI VOTE MEAN FOR LABOUR? \nThe fight for the Maori seats has heated up this year with a resurgence from the Maori Party, which will only be enhanced with Mana out of the picture, and a promise to run high-profile candidates in the various electorates. \nSo far the only big name revealed has been Howie Tamati, a former New Zealand league player and New Plymouth district councillor, who has been selected for the Te Tai Hauauru seat. \nThe other big player aligned with the Maori Party was broadcaster Willie Jackson who was tipped to run in Tamaki Makaurau against Labour's Peeni Henare. \nHowever Labour leader Andrew Little approached Jackson to stand for the Opposition and the pair announced he would run on the party's list at Waitangi this year. \nHenare won the Auckland Maori seat with a majority of 1462 votes and a united Maori and Mana Party would pose a threat in the electorate, depending on who they find to run there now that Jackson is off the table. \nHenare revealed at Waitangi earlier this month that he had been asked by the party last year to stand aside in the electorate and run on the list but not because of Jackson joining - the former Alliance MP's move to the party came only recently. \nLittle continues to deny that Henare was asked to step aside but it's clear the party has concerns about what a unified Maori vote would do for Henare's chances. \nHenare said on Monday following the announcement that the deal doesn't bother him at all. \n\"I think our people deserve to see some policy and detail, not just the characters. \n\"Moving forward I can't see any real threat until this election becomes an election debated on policies and decided on policies over personalities,\" he said. \nPOLITICAL ATTACKS OFF THE TABLE \nThe unity between Mana and the Maori Party extends to their approach to the election. The agreement stipulates \"mutual respect\" will be shown in the lead-up to the election, which means no political attacks on each other. \nBoth parties will campaign for the party vote and the deal will end when voting in the general election on September 23 has closed. \nMorgan says since 2009 the Maori Party has delivered \"more than $1 billion in funding for initiatives that benefit Maori\". \n\"Maori must ask themselves just what 80 years of allegiance to Labour has bought them. The alliance grew out of necessity but it did not stop the last Labour Government from legislating another raupatu or confiscation through the Foreshore and Seabed Act.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:07:40.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
