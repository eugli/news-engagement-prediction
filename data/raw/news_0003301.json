It might be the last request of her's to wrestle alongside her boyfriend before she retires. \nThis might be a surprising match, but it should go down well with fans as it not only keeps Cena out of the main event - which is expected to be Orton vs Bray Wyatt for the WWE title - but also gives him a good opponent in The Miz. \nWith the wrestling experience of Maryse and Nikki as well being very accomplished in-ring performers with several Divas titles between them, it should turn out to be one of the best mixed tag team matches we have seen in recent years. \nIt's probably going to end with a Cena-Bella win due to the fact The Fearless One could be bowing out of the business, but it still should be an entertaining match because of the performers involved. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
