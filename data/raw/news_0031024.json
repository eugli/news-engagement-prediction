Then Anthony provided offense when they needed it clinging to a two-point lead, making consecutive baskets to make it 92-86 with 33 seconds remaining. \nAnthony's relationship with Phil Jackson and resulting trade rumors were a constant throughout the homestand, though the fallout from Oakley's arrest after an altercation with security guards last Wednesday became the bigger story. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
