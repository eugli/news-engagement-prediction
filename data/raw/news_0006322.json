Fast track refugee applications approved in the U.S. prior to the start of the ban on Friday, or whose U.S. applications were near completion. Work with international community to address shortfall of refugee resettlement resources. Immediately suspend the “safe third country” agreement between Canada and the U.S., which would open the door for refugees in the States to seek asylum in Canada. \nWATCH: NDP MP Alexandre Boulerice says emergency debate is positive to discuss Trump’s travel bans \n“As we enter into this debate tonight, we want to make sure we come forward with a plan the government can implement,” Kwan said. \nIn his most sweeping decision since taking office Jan. 20, Trump on Friday signed an executive order putting an indefinite hold on allowing Syrian refugees into the United States, a four-month hold on accepting refugees from all other countries, and a three-month ban on travel for people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen. \nWATCH: Protest erupt at U.S. airports as Donald Trump’s travel ban takes effect Tears at LAX as Trump’s immigration order divides families ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:01:56.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
