Her skull had been cracked and she had suffered injuries to her genitals indicating sexual abuse\nInformation posted on a Facebook page called Justice for Laylah revealed that the young girl had her skull smashed and spent two days in a coma before succumbing to her injuries.\nLaylah's great-aunt has launched a GoFundMe campaign to help with the toddler's final expenses. As of Friday afternoon, it has drawn just under $1,900 in donations.\nA funeral service for Laylah Heether will be held Monday at Crandell Funeral Home's White Cloud Chapel in White Cloud.\nThe child is survived by her mother, biological father Robert Heether and six brothers and sisters.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/LaylahsJustice/", "http://woodtv.com/2017/02/24/suspect-in-toddlers-death-facing-homicide-charge/", "https://www.gofundme.com/funeral-fund-for-laylah-heether"], "published": "2017-02-24T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T09:09:03.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
