I am looking forward to my hearing. — Andy Puzder (@AndyPuzder) January 16, 2017 \nThe woman declined an offer from Puzder to assist her in getting legal status because she was afraid she would be deported, a source told the Huffington Post. \nIn an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Puzder wrote that he supported a “ path to legal status ” that would be “ short of citizenship ” if an undocumented worker could pass a background check, pay a fine, and learn English, among other measures. \n“ Every option should be on the table, except amnesty, which forgives illegal conduct. It isn’t amnesty if immigrants admit wrongdoing and accept punishment, ” Puzder wrote.

Read more \nRoss says that he was deceived by the employee’s immigration status, and has since fired the worker. \nUnder previous administrations, nominees who admitted to hiring undocumented workers were forced to withdraw. \nIn 2001, President George W. Bush’s nominee for labor secretary, Linda Chavez, withdrew her nomination after it was revealed that she allowed an undocumented Guatemalan woman to live in her house. \nIn 1993, President Bill Clinton’s nominee for attorney general, Zoe Baird, withdrew her nomination after it was revealed that she was paying an undocumented couple under the table as a nanny and part-time driver. \nClinton’s second nominee for attorney general, Kimba Wood, also had to withdraw from her nomination for employing an undocumented immigrant as a babysitter. \nPuzder’s confirmation hearing was scheduled for February 7, but has been delayed for the fourth time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:47:57.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
