It devolved into violence and destruction of property that was characterized as “anti-free speech” intolerance by many on the right. \nIn in opinion column in the New York Times, Malini Ramaiyer, a reporter for the UC Berkeley newspaper, recalled talking to a victim of the leftist violence. Then I saw someone wearing all black walk up to a student wearing a suit and say, “You look like a Nazi.” The student was confused, but before he could reply, the black-clad person pepper-sprayed him and hit him on the back with a rod. \nRamaiyer says she ran after the man, and asked to get his name and other information. He told her he was a Syrian Muslim, but he ran off in fear for more attacks from the protesters. \nThe rioting was ostensibly against Trump’s executive orders, including the controversial travel ban that put a moratorium on refugee resettlement from certain terror-stricken countries including Syria, where the Berkeley victim said he was from. \nThe Berkeley rioting became a divisive issue as some on the left defended the violence, while others agreed with the right that it was counterproductive. Trump even threatened to cut federal funding from the school if they continued with this kind of violence. If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view – NO FEDERAL FUNDS? \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017 \nTrump’s advisor Kellyanne Conway went further and blamed the media for inciting rioting against Trump supporters. One ugly example was caught on video when a woman in a Trump hat was pepper sprayed by a protester.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:04:14.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
