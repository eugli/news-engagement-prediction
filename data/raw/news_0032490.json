She had also fronted up to the victim's family at a restorative justice meeting. \nHe said said the theft had been motivated by Smith's failing business venture. \n\"She has taken the money to try and keep that business float,\" he said. \nAt the time she was also coping with the death of her father, who had also been helping her manage her financial problems. \n\"She then lost the ability to behave rationally,\" he said. \nTo date, Smith had paid back $130 of the stolen money, Rai said. \nJudge Chris Sygrove said it appeared Smith's life went into a \"downward spiral\" following the failure of her business and the death of her father. \n\"You admitted you couldn't cope anymore,\" Sygrove said, before adding that this was no excuse for what she had done. \nSmith was sentenced to a four month term of community detention and was ordered to complete 100 hours of community work. \nA reparation order for $10,230 was also imposed. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:00:05.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
