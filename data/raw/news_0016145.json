They are even looked at with doubt in the name of terrorism. All that the BJP has done ever since it came to power is to focus on the RSS agenda of strengthening communal forces\".\nOn Wednesday, virtually releasing the BSP's manifesto in poll-bound UP, Mayawati had told a large gathering in Meerut that she would start a drive for victims who could not file FIRs during the Samajwadi Party rule and that innocents in jail would get their freedom after due scrutiny.\nShe also told her supporters that she has \"inside information\" that the NDA government at the centre is working towards stopping all caste-based reservations. Dubbing the BJP \"anti-Dalits\", Mayawati warned people that the Union government would discontinue reservation for SCs and STs. Addressing an election rally in Aligarh, she claimed a vote for the BJP in UP would be a vote against reservations.\nMayawati, who is hoping for a consolidation of Dalit-Muslim votes, has been hitting out much more at the BJP than her rival in the state, Samajwadi Party. There were strong indications during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls that Dalit had abandoned the BSP to vote for BJP, putting their faith in Narendra Modi 's promise of \"achhe din\".\nRaising the exodus issue, Mayawati slammed both the SP-Congress combine and BJP. \"The biggest exodus was during the Congress rule when after Independence the maximum number of people left UP in search of employment. In SP rule, people migrated from UP due to bad law and order situation. And with BJP at the centre, many were forced to go out in search of jobs to save their demonetisation-hit, starving families.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T11:49:54.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
