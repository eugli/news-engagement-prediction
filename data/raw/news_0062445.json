Etim reportedly threw himself against as many as four vehicles on East Prescott Road, including single-decker Stagecoach and Arriva buses. All but one of the vehicles was believed to be stationary at the time. Etim was eventually restrained by police and taken to a hospital, where his condition is serious, according to the report. Witnesses saw a blood-covered Etim running through traffic and throwing himself at the windshield of vehicles shortly after 2 p.m. local time. “It was one of the worst things I’ve ever seen,” Andrea McCullough, a hairdresser who witnessed the scene, told the Echo. “His friends were running after him and trying to restrain him on the floor but he managed to break free and was running in and around all the cars.” Another witness, Alan Miles, reportedly attempted to help restrain Etim at a nearby car park, but the ex-fighter was able to escape. “He had blood all over him, and I got a lot of it on my hands as I tried to hold him down,” Miles said. The incident brought traffic to a standstill in the area and several of the vehicles that Etim hit had shattered windshields, according to the report. Etim, 31, last fought at Bellator 109 on Nov. 22, 2013, when he took a unanimous decision over Patrick Cenoble .The Liverpool native went 6-5 during a UFC stint from 2007 to 2013 before exiting the promotion following back-to-back losses to Edson Barboza and Renee Forte . He compiled a 16-5 career mark over the course of a career that began in 2005.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:55:35.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
