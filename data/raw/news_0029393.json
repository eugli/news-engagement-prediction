The ’90s Nickelodeon icon — who returned to the network in 2015 on the Dan Schneider show Game Shakers — appropriately announced the happy news on Valentine's Day. \nSharing an adorable pic of the precious couple, both Mitchell and Lee sport Good Burger hats while Lee holds a bottle of orange soda, a relic from Mitchell's Kenan & Kel days. \nLee shared the same pic on her Instagram, captioning, \"Thank you @iamkelmitchell for loving me unconditionally from the very beginning!! I am blessed enough to get to call you my best friend & my husband everyday & now I get to call you my baby daddy! Lolol I love you so much!\" \nThis little baby will be Mitchell's third child , but his first one with Lee, whom he married in 2012 . His kids, Allure and Lyric , were from his previous marriage to Tyisha Hampton. \nCongrats to the happy couple!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T20:35:46.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
