(Picture: Getty) \nManchester United star Jesse Lingard joined an elite group of players with his first-half goal against Southampton in the EFL Cup final on Sunday afternoon. Necessary? Man United star goads Liverpool after EFL Cup final victory \nLingard scored United’s second goal of the game, in between Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s magnificent double, and the Englishman is making a habit of scoring at Wembley. \nRemarkably, the forward became only the third player in history to find the net in a League Cup final, an FA Cup final and a Charity Shield at the ground. \nOnly United legend Mark Hughes and Liverpool great Ian Rush have ever managed the same feat and Lingard was taken aback when he was made aware of this fact after the match. Jesse Lingard joins Mark Hughes and Ian Rush with his goal at Wembley (Picture: Getty) \nThe 24-year-old has hardly been prolific over the course of his Red Devils career but clearly thrives under pressure on big occasions. \nJose Mourinho will hope for more of the same from Lingard as the side continue to fight for a place in next season’s Champions League.
