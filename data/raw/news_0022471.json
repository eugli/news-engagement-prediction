The country superstar got honest this week when he dropped by the CMT radio studio, revealing he long misunderstood the true meaning of “tough.”“For a long time in my like, I had a misconception of what being tough was,” Brantley says exclusively. “I thought being tough was all about being physically though, an intimidating figure, and being able to handle yourself physically ...
