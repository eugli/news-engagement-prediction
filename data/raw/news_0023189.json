At one time, factories in Alaska processed the fish to be frozen and exported to around the world. However, many of these shut down after the Chinese entered the processing market with an abundance of cheap labour. This meant it became economic to ship vast quantities of pink or chum salmon across the Pacific to China for processing. The best way to remove the bones from salmon is by hand, which is something Chinese companies are able to do cheaply in plants around ports such as Dalian on the north east coast. In some cases, the salmon is doused in phosphates which encourage the flesh to take up water to ensure they remain moist and appear fresh when they reach their final destination. Once frozen, the salmon is shipped via Hong Kong through the Gulf of Thailand, Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea, Suez Canal, Mediterranean, English Channel and North Sea to the Netherlands. The final leg of the journey involves a trip to Felixstowe, Immingham or Southampton. And even after their 13-week journey is complete, the salmon fillets can be left on ice for up to 18 months before reaching the supermarket shelves (stock photo) As well as Tesco, Young's sells a pack of four Pacific Pink Salmon Fillets on which the country of origin is listed as China. Sainsbury's sells 360g packs of frozen salmon fillets which are listed as 'Packaged in the UK or China'. Asda and Morrisons sell frozen salmon fillets without offering clear information on where they were processed. Ruth Westcott, of Sustain – a campaign group lobbying for better food and farming – said: 'Common sense says we should be buying salmon locally, it is a species that, a long time ago, was plentiful in the waters and rivers around the UK. 'With Brexit, we have an opportunity to manage our natural resources better ... Consumers can avoid buying salmon that has been shipped across the world simply by choosing oily fish species caught closer to home.' The Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute said shipping salmon to the UK via China is good for consumers and the environment. A spokesman said: 'The carbon footprint is not as large as you may think. These fish could be filleted in Alaska, but it would add a lot of cost to the product to staff large fillet lines for short periods. 'Salmon ... are exported to China because it is the most efficient means of providing a quality product.' They added that hand filleting provides a better yield than machine filleting, which 'offsets the CO2 footprint and means more of the fish is consumed and utilised'.
