By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Friday, February 17, 2017 - 11:12 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nNew Delhi: Maverick filmmaker Karan Johar has always been in the news whether good or otherwise. The Dharma productions' honcho recently released his much-talked about biography 'An Unsuitable Boy', revealing what had been kept under the wraps for many years. \nIn his memoir, KJo (as he is fondly called) has described his personal experiences and what went behind making of a man called Karan Johar. His journey to stardom and how several situations left him baffled and sometimes in a tight spot. \nInterestingly, New York Times magazine has hailed Karan as the 'man who let India out of closet'. Well, that's precisely what the headline of their article says. The NY Times has praised and applauded the filmmaker for standing out in the crowd and speaking his mind. MUST READ I felt terrible about 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' apology video: Karan Johar \nAbout Johar, the article quotes, “As a young protégé of his told me, “He is Bollywood.” \nFurther, they write, “An ocean of innuendo has always surrounded Mr. Johar’s sexuality. He has done more than anybody to introduce the idea of homosexuality into the Indian home. It would seem no closet door was better primed to spring open than his. And yet when he tries the latch, he finds it sticks. “The only time I’m tight-lipped is when I’m asked about my sexuality,” he writes in his recently published memoir, “An Unsuitable Boy.” “It’s the only part of me I feel I’ve caged.” \n“One recent night in Mumbai, I found myself at a small party at Mr. Johar’s house. A group of stars had gathered on a balcony, overlooking the liquid darkness of sea and city lights. I’d just finished Mr. Johar’s book. Its last line is: “Death doesn’t scare me, life sometimes does.” \n“He is of that generation that came of sexual age maybe five or 10 years before the freedoms of this recent time burst upon us. That meant that Mr. Johar, though he has tried actively to find love — even, as he writes in his memoir, resorting to an agency that deals exclusively with the ultrarich and famous — faces the prospect of growing old alone. It’s a theme he returns to again and again in the book, as does his desire to have children. I hope he does.” \nFirst Published: Friday, February 17, 2017 - 11:12 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:57:16.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
