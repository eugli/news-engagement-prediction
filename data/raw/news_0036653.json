The scientists tried to slow down the process with help of SkQ1 – a synthetic antioxidant, protecting from the reactive oxygen – the main “byproduct” of damaged mitochondria, which severely damages cells. \nA special strain of genetically modified mice created in Sweden was used to speed up the experiment. A regular mouse has a lifespan of over one year, while the mutant mouse has a drastically accelerated mutagenesis in mitochondria which results in rapid aging and early death. Genetically modified mice live less than a year and rapidly develops all the aging-related traits. \nThe rodents were divided in two groups and starting from the age of 100 days, one group started to receive small doses of SkQ1 in their drinking water, which should have protected them from aging. Another group of mice served as a control group and drank regular water. \nBy the age of 150-200 days, the differences between the two groups became very clear. Rodents from the control group aged as expected and suffered from various related issues, such as balding, osteoporosis, and weight loss. The mice that were treated with SkQ1 showed significant deceleration in developing some aging traits, while a number of them did not appear at all.

At the same time our study opens the way to the treatment of aging with mitochondrially targeted antioxidants,” the professor said. \nProfessor Skulachev’s group has been working on mitochondrially targeted pharmaceutical drugs based on SkQ1. The maiden product – eye drops – is already being manufactured in Russia. A drug for internal use is currently being tested in clinics. If the experiments are as successful as the ones with mice, an “anti-aging drug” might hit the market in two or three years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:08:01.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
