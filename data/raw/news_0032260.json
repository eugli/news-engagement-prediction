I don’t want to sell him, I want him to stay here for a long time until he decides.” \nThe dropping of Aguero came after months of Guardiola demanding more from the striker. View gallery \nIn the space of three starts Jesus has produced the type of intensity outside of the box that his manager craves - as well providing three goals in what has been an outstanding start to his City career. \nGuardiola was frank about his decision to drop Aguero for the last two games against West Ham and Swansea - and his comments have only underlined the difficulty the 28-year-old faces in forcing his way back in ahead of Jesus, Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling. \n“The reason he’s not played the last two games are because Leroy, Gabriel and Raheem have played amazing,” he added. “That’s the only reason why. \n“If I can change the model and play all four, but I am a guy who likes to play midfield players to have more control. \n“If what I feel now is that if Leroy, Gabriel or Raheem don’t play then he will be in for them. \n“He remains a top player and an important one for us to achieve our goals. Aguero has been dropped for the last two games \n“I don’t have doubts about that. \n“I was so clear with Sergio. With seven games banned, we missed him a lot. Every time he played when he was fit - he did a good performance and sometimes not. I know his level and I know what he’s done for this club. \n“The others played good and I decide to play with them. \n“I was clear every time we spoke with Sergio from the beginning. \n“I know his strengths. I know he’s trying, I know how much he fought against Tottenham and how many chances he had. \n“But at Palace I saw three guys in front with a high intensity and said ‘Wow, I like what they do’. \n“In the last game it gave them continuity. \n“My advice to the guys is keep going - show me again how good you are.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:06:37.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
