Members Sign In Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to keep fighting The Boston Globe ERIK S. LESSER/European Pressphoto Agency Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton delivered a videotaped address during the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Winter Meeting in Atlanta. By Aimee Ortiz Globe Staff February 25, 2017 \nHillary Clinton has kept a relatively low profile since losing the election in November — a few public appearances and walks in the woods notwithstanding. But she has a new message for her fellow Democrats: “keep fighting.” \nAppearing in a video message at the Democratic Party’s Winter Meeting in Atlanta on Friday, Clinton, who has stayed out of the Democrats’ contest for party chair, praised the Jan. 21 women’s marches across the country and other signs of public criticism of Trump Advertisement \n‘‘Let resistance plus persistence equal progress for our party and our country,’’ she said. \nShe also indirectly noted her popular vote victory, which Trump has insisted was not legitimate. ‘‘Nearly 66 million votes,’’ she said, ‘‘are fueling grassroots energy and activism.’’ Get Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller.
