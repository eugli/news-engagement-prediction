It is not that we do not discuss love and relationships every other day but Valentine Day’s somehow brings in a little more ardour. Amidst all the talk about gifts, cards and roses, we also decided to take a look at the kinds of heroes and heroines people are liking on daily soaps. The year 2016 has brought in some fresh ideas and heightened sensuality but some classic types are always there to stay. Of course, it seems like a lot of writers take inspiration from the classic Mills and Boons series that have different categories. Then, there are timeless inspirations from English literature. Here is a look at few protagonists who fit in some prototypes… \nShivaay Singh Oberoi of Ishqbaaz Ladies out there love to read about men who have the wealth and status to have everything at their command except of course, love. They need that one woman who does not give two hoots about his stature and can give him a piece of her mind. Doesn’t this element remind you of a classic Mills and Boons Sexy novel where powerful men and feisty women challenge each other while realising that they fantasize each other romantically. The world around them is full of deception and intrigue and their physical intimacy promises to fasten your pulse. Just think Nakuul Mehta as Shivaay…Blush blush. (Also Read: Dil Bole Oberoi Review: Kunal Jaisingh and Rahul Dev stand out in the first episode) \nDev and Sonakshi from Kuch Rang Pyar Ke Aise Bhi Trust us, DevAkshi are straight out of Mills and Boons Essence tales. The two characters are focused individuals who have goals in life besides love. Their ideologies force them to forget love as and when required. Though their situations might seem exaggerated but they are extremely realistic. People who love such stories want the couple to find solutions for their problems and be united FOREVER. (Also Read: Kuch Rang Pyar Ke Aise Bhi 13 February 2017, Written Update Of Full Episode: Dev throws a fit after finding about Sona and Jatin) \nShravan and Suman from Ek Duje Ke Vaaste No heightened sexual tension but their story is extremely romantic in itself. The hero is an intelligent well-placed man a girl would aspire to marry. These are tales where a girl takes the story forward. We can relate to her emotions as she discovers her true feelings for the special man. The guys are pretty intense such types of romantic series and can do anything in love. Did someone just mention Shravan Malhotra? \nAtharv from Jaana Na Dil Se Door On the surface, Atharv from Jaana Na Dil Se Door is the typical hero from a 90s classic romance of a rich girl and poor boy. The only difference here is that our girl, Vividha is not class conscious and rather timid. Amidst some sizzling romance, she finds her voice courtesy her ‘man’. We are sure you have seen many heroes like him in literature right from old classics to more contemporary tales. Tall, brooding, handsome, fiery and protective, he is a trademark sort. \nRanveer from Meri Aashiqui Tumse Hi The show might have gone off air but there is no denying that it was one of the best romances of recent times. The character of Ranveer was reportedly inspired by Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights but it was far less darker than the tormentor in Emily Bronte’s classic. From unrequited love to childhood romance, it was way too literary. \nSo do you feel the Mills and Boons effect is too prevalent in daily soaps. Do let us know with your comments?
