Investigations by the cops further exacerbate Norman's descent into madness as visions of Norma haunt him while her actual remains sit stuffed in the cellar. \nRihanna makes her appearance as Marion Crane – originally portrayed by actress Janet Leigh – at the end of the trailer. She checks in to the Bates Motel and in the the final moments Norman peers through a peephole as the shower runs. \nRihanna was tapped to play Crane last year after professing she was a Bates Motel fan. In an interview with EW , executive producer Kerry Ehrin said that Rihanna will play a more fleshed out version of the character Leigh portrayed in Psycho . In the 1960 thriller, Crane arrives at the Bates Motel after stealing money from her boss for her boyfriend, but is famously killed during the first act. \n\"It's tough to be in a situation where you're in love with a guy, and for whatever reason, he keeps stalling,\" Ehrin said. \"It was trying to do a story about a contemporary woman with some edge, with some expectations, who isn't perfect, who isn't always perfectly sweet, who is in that situation, but we’re rooting for her to get what she wants.\" \nBates Motel returns February 20th on A&E. Along with her multi-episode arc on the show, Rihanna has several more forthcoming acting projects including Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets and Ocean's Eight .
