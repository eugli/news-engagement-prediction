They are standing close together, but it is difficult to make out what they’re thinking through their facial expressions. \nWhile shooting for the poster, Ko So Young and Jo Yeo Jeong responded professionally to the photographer’s request for them to stand closer together in order to create a more intense feeling. According to reports, the two actresses monitored their photos together and were unsparing with their praise for each other. \nA source from the production team explained, “This poster reflects the peculiar relationship between Jae Bok and Eun Hee. The two characters have completely different atmospheres, which will lead viewers to feel a strange tension when they come across each other.” \n“Perfect Wife” is set to air on February 27 as a follow-up for “ Hwarang .” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:57:41.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
