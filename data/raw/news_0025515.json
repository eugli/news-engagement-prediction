But being fully engulfed in flames…there’s nothing too much nobody can do but try to put water on him.” \nFirefighters arrived to extinguish the blaze, Coney said, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene. \nIt’s unclear at this time how the fire was set; if it was intentional or an accident. No one else was hurt. \nConey was asked how the employees who witnessed the incident are handling it. \n“Anytime you see something like that it is traumatic. They’re doing their best. They’ve grief counselors in there right now assisting them,” Coney said. \nThe man was not immediately identified, although people at the scene said they’d heard he was the husband or boyfriend of someone who worked at the Wendy’s. That was not confirmed by authorities. \nAn investigation is ongoing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:28:28.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
