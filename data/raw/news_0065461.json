But it also does yearly surveys of 50,000+ people about fast food, and those people have said more than once that Habit ranks up there with In-N-Out as one of the top burger chains in the country. Like In-N-Out, Habit open-flame grills its Charburgers -- and it has been doing this since it opened in 1969. That's way before the internet made it possible for you to be reading this. But unlike In-N-Out, Habit has made strides to update its menu for modern times. To wit: an Asian-inspired Teriyaki Charburger that comes topped with grilled pineapple and caramelized onions, and its juicy Santa Barbara Style double Charburger which has a heavy helping of avocado on grilled sourdough. And if you're sick of pairing a burger with the thick-cut fries that Habit serves up, there's always the flash-fried tempura green beans. It probably ain't healthy, but when else are you going to eat green beans that taste this good? Halo Burger 10 locations in Michigan Best burger: The Beefy Double cheeseburger (four patties, four pieces of cheese, a Big Mac-style middle bun, customizable toppings) Having outlasted even the auto industry in Vehicle City, Bill Thomas’ Halo Burger has been slinging its Kewpee burgers (that’s cute-speak for “quarter pounder\") since 1923, with its Downtown Flint drive-thru jockeying with a mural of ginger ale-making gnomes for the city’s most beloved still-living icons. That longevity is attributed to the joint’s phenomenal -- and phenomenally messy -- no-frills burgers, which are flat, salty, and have very little structural integrity. The signature here is the Olive Burger, which is overflowing with green, pimento-laden olives. But if you can’t handle the brine, opt for the Beefy Double, which is basically like a Big Mac on steroids, minus the secret sauce but plus a flavor that McDonald’s can’t touch. Oh, and since you were about to make a bad water joke, save your breath. The drink of choice here is the Boston Cooler, with the world’s best ginger ale (that’d be Vernors) blended with ice cream. 17 locations in Connecticut, DC, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia Best burger: New Mexico (queso, roasted green chiles, pickled red onions) Bobby Flay doesn't need an introduction, so we're not giving him one. The Food Network grill master's burger chain is rapidly expanding due in part to the menu, which is loaded with dishes themed after cities. Take for example, the Philly with provolone and griddled onions, or the New Mexico with queso, and the Miami with ham. But the real genius to this chain is that you can get your burger topped with potato chips, which is such a good idea it should be standard everywhere. The burger lineup gets refreshed each month and each order can be paired with a spiked milkshake -- another thing that should be standard everywhere. Plus, if you've ever debated with yourself over fries or onion rings, order The Undecided and you'll get 'em both. Either way, don't forget to douse them in one of the chain’s stellar dipping sauces, like the funkily sweet horseradish honey mustard. Courtesy of Hopdoddy Burger Bar 17 locations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Texas Best burger: El Diablo (pepper jack cheese, caramelized onions, habanero/serrano chiles, salsa roja, chipotle mayo) There are few meal pairings more satisfying than a burger and a beer. But too often when you order a drink in a burger place, the beer is basically a glass of water with a sad, lone hop floating around in it. Hopdoddy does not screw around with its craft brews, however, offering up pours from beloved local breweries. Luckily for America, the burgers at this Austin-born chain are even better than the beer selection. They put a priority on food being really fresh. Case-in-point: Even the bun is baked freshly in-house. Plus, the beef is from humanely raised cows. Consider ordering those freshly ground patties Texas-style with chile con carne and Fritos, or if you like a little more heat, with habaneros, serranos, and salsa roja. For dessert, you'd be silly to skip out on the decadent, chocoholic-favorite Nutella & Chocolate Pretzel shake. And while the focus here is on the beef burger, it's impossible not to mention the impossibly tender Greek burger, with a lamb patty, feta, pickled red onions, and tzatziki. 24 locations in California, Illinois, Nevada, New York Best burger: Hatch (hatch chiles, the funky American cheese-esque Cali cheese, roasted garlic aioli) Pop quiz: what the heck is umami? If you answered \"the Spanish word for sexy that's been misspelled,\" you're wrong! It's actually the fifth taste -- something that's not salty, sweet, sour, or bitter. It's just... something else. The burgers served up here are meant to maximize the amount of umami flavor you get in every bite, which is why you'll see umami-rich ingredients like Parmesan, shiitake mushrooms, and roasted tomatoes. It's no wonder that when it debuted in Los Angeles in the late '00s, it took the city by storm. Since then, Umami Burger has slowly spread its reach across the US. The unique burger lineup includes outrageously creative options like the K-BBQ, which has a Gochujang glaze, caramelized kimchi, and Korean-spiced ketchup (something Heinz should definitely get on). But the secret sauce of Umami Burgers burgers is the literal secret sauce. The chain calls it the Umami Master Sauce, and it's a combination of a sweet/spicy Chinese hoisin sauce, the nutrient-rich kombu (aka kelp), and soy sauce. OK, guess it's not so secret anymore. But it helps Umami Burger stand out from the crowd. 83 locations in AK, AL, AZ, CA, CO, CT, FL, GA, IL, KS, KY, MD, MI, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TN, TX, VA Best burger: 4x4 (four Angus patties, four slices of cheese) You better go to BurgerFi hungry, because most of the burgers on the menu come with two Angus patties. You'll barely have room to also eat its beef dogs, custards, and sides. But you still probably will, because items like the decadent Red Velvet Custard Concrete (thick vanilla custard + red velvet cake) and the crispy Cry+Fry (half onion ring + half fries) are worth saving real estate for in your stomach. And while the menu is relatively tiny, like In-N-Out, there's a slew of secret menu items to order that aren't so secret. Among them is the gigantic 4x4, which is basically a Big Mac on steroids with four Angus patties, four slices of cheese, and plenty of mayo-based BurgerFi sauce. Luckily it's not actually on steroids, since the beef is all-natural. On the opposite end of the health spectrum, there's also a Hippie Veggie, which is decidedly not boring and includes two of its beloved, crunchy quinoa burgers (which are packed with lentils, fontina, Parmesan, and panko), and comes on a potato bun.
