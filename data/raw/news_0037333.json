Kings of metal Metallica try their hand at singing Rihanna 's dance-pop hit \"Diamonds\" before surprising people at a local supermarket with an \"Enter Sandman\" sing-along. John Legend reveals that he's often confused with Pharrell Williams . And WWE star John Cena and NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal can't even fit in the car together. \nUse the media player included with this article to watch the trailer, but if this is even a quarter of what the series will look like, music fans will want to make an appointment for the full show. \n\"Carpool Karaoke\" is an extension of the hit segment from CBS's \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\" , and in fact Corden makes an appearance in one episode. He's not just slapping his name on the show; he's showing up to sing \"I Believe I Can Fly\" with Will Smith - while riding in a helicopter. That should clue you in to the fact that this will be more than just stretching the \"Late Show\" skit too far or another singing show. It appears to be musical mayhem of the very best kind. \nWho doesn't want to watch Metallica singing a song that couldn't be further removed from their own music? Or Legend hitting the completely wrong key on \"Happy\" while Alicia Keys laughs at him? And speaking of coaches from \"The Voice,\" Blake Shelton finds time to stop by and of course, wind up in a bar. \nThe series is mixing things up with artists performing more than their own songs, and pairing artists with people who are not primarily known as musicians. Ariana Grande is partnered with Seth MacFarlane, who is an award-nominated recording artist but will be recognized as the creator of \"Family Guy.\" Aside from Cena and O'Neal, talk show host Chelsea Handler, NFL star Michael Strahan and NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon also make appearances. \nThat's what will set \"Carpool Karaoke\" apart in a crowded field of singing shows. It's expanding on the concept that was set up on \"The Late Late Show.\" It's challenging artists and coming up with some unexpected combinations. Hopefully it will continue to shove artists out of their comfort zones. Any time you can get Metallica belting out Rihanna, what's not to love about that? \n\"Carpool Karaoke\" doesn't have an exact premiere date yet, but will be exclusively on Apple's subscription service Apple Music. More information about the show and the service can be found here . \nFor more on any of the featured artists, click their names above to visit their artist pages at AXS.
