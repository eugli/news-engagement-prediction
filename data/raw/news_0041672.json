They generally adopt an approach to life that values quality over quantity,” said lead author Oliver Sng, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan. \nIn environments where population density is low and there is thus relatively little competition for available resources, there are few costs but lots of advantages to adopting a ‘fast’ strategy. People living in big cities have fewer children and invest more in education, says the research.
