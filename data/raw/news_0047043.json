It wasn’t about the combined 63 points Tennessee (15-12, 7-7 SEC) got from Hubbs, freshman forward Grant Williams (game-high 25 points) and sophomore Admiral Schofield (17). Instead, it was about the new hairstyle Hubbs showed up with at Thompson-Boling Arena on Saturday. \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?

(Photo: Randy Sartin, USA TODAY Sports) He went from “Crazy Hair Hubbs,” as sophomore guard Shembari Phillips called him, to cornrows. “Boy that was awful, wasn’t it?” Barnes joked about the new look. “He actually said to me, ‘It feels really good,’” Barnes continued. “So I said, ‘Why don’t you just cut it off?’ He said something about his face. You’ll have to ask him about it.” Asked about Hubbs’ performance — 9-for-17 from the floor while scoring his 21 points, two assists and no turnovers in 33 minutes — brought a much different response from the Tennessee head coach. “It was great,” Barnes said. “It started (Friday). We’ve been fighting a little bit of the flu bug and he’s been fighting through some injuries that he’s had to deal with. “He hasn’t practiced really at all since after our Kentucky game here (on Jan. 24).” Friday afternoon’s practice, as short and sweet as it was, is all Hubbs needed to bounce back. “He came out (Friday) and was terrific,” Barnes said of Hubbs, who practiced with hair that was still free flowing. “We didn’t go long yesterday. “We probably went an hour and 15 minutes because of guys under the weather. But he came out in practice yesterday and was terrific.” Hubbs, Tennessee's leading scorer at 14.3 points per game this season, wasn’t terrific during Tuesday's 83-58 loss at No. 13 Kentucky. He tied a season-low with 24 minutes played and scored only seven points, being held to single-digit production for the second time in four game. Barnes said before Friday’s workout that those numbers have been a factor of managing Hubbs’ body in practice, giving him enough maintenance days to be primed and ready to go on game day. “It has been a little bit (frustrating),” Hubbs said of being limited to a spectator in some practices. “We’re in February right now, we have practices and games, we have a lot on our bodies and stuff. “But it’s not an excuse. I just have to take care of my body, do the best I can every night when it’s my turn.” Friday’s practices need to be replicated moving forward, as the Vols try to keep working through Hubbs over the final four games of the regular season. (Photo: Tennessee athletics, UTSports.com) “Everyone was on edge and focused,” Hubbs said. “That’s the way we need to be every practice. I did a real good job of getting our guys to lock in at walk-through this morning and yesterday’s practice. It paid off today.” Barnes did a double-take when Hubbs walked in the media room after the game, pausing while being asked a question because “I just saw the worst haircut I’ve ever seen.” Hubbs looked over his shoulder toward his coach and blew a kiss. Then Barnes went back to managing Hubbs’ workload. “We probably should have not put him out there that (for 33 minutes),” Barnes said. “I just don’t want him to lose his conditioning. “He was really, really good today.” Barnes after his press conference requested a photo opportunity with Hubbs, “so you can make me look good.” Hubbs, taking the verbal jabs in stride, said he won’t be pressuring his teammates into cornrows of their own. “Nah,” he said. “It’s up to them.” He may even change it up himself before Tennessee hosts Vanderbilt (13-13, 6-7) on Wednesday (TV: SEC Network, 6:30 p.m.). “I don’t know,” Hubbs said. “I might try to surprise y’all.” \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
