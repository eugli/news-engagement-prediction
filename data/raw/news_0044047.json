Economic and financial experts are divided over the outlook for the Naira this year but many have said the local currency may depreciate further in the coming months. But according to a Bureau de change source, currency traders are trying to digest a new central bank decision to sell dollars to retail users through commercial lenders. It was gathered that the Central Bank of Nigeria plans to sell $1 million weekly to each of the country's 21 commercial lenders at a rate of 375 naira to clear a backlog of demand for retail users, and try to narrow the premium between the official and black market rates.
