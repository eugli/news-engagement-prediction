A dugout signal will do. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:18 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:18 p.m. ET \nNo longer will pitchers have to throw four pitches to a standing catcher in order to intentionally walk a batter. A signal from the dugout will suffice. \nMLB and the players' union agreed to make a change to the intentional walk rule effective for the 2017 season, according to ESPN.com . \nMORE: MLB commissioner slams players' union \nMLB commissioner Rob Manfred has emphasized pace of play changes like this as a priority. Manfred blasted the union earlier Tuesday for not agreeing to a number of proposed changes. \nEliminating the four-pitch intentional walk would reduce at least a minute from games that would include one. There were 932 intentional walks during the 2016 MLB season. \nWhile many welcome anything that would speed up the game, some say getting rid of the pitcher actually having to throw four balls toward the plate detracts from the game. \nThere have been rare occurrences of a pitcher overthrowing the catcher, allowing any runners on base to advance. Some batters have even swung at pitches that come close to the plate, with a few getting hits off those swings. Barry Bonds was even walked with the bases loaded as opposing teams were fine with conceding one run instead of allowing Bonds to potentially drive in more.
