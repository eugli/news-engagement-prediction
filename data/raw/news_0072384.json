This is about helping people. And seven out of 10 say they want to quit. \n\"So it's the chance when they're in the hospital to get them in touch with people who can help. And we know if you get that help, you're four times more likely to quit forever.\" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Duncan Selbie wants a renewed effort to get patients to stop smoking \nAccording to PHE, smoking causes 96,000 deaths a year in the UK, and for each of those deaths, about 20 smokers are suffering from a smoking-related disease. \nAbout 475,000 hospital admissions in England were attributable to smoking in 2014-15, and the annual cost is estimated at £2bn, with a further £1.1bn in social care costs. \nDr Frank Ryan, a consultant psychologist at the Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, said more people had to be encouraged not to smoke. \n\"It's really about refocusing our efforts and motivating our service users and staff to quit. \n\"And of course, whatever investment we make in smoking cessation programmes, there's a payback many times more in terms of the health benefits and even factors such as attendance at work, because it's workers who smoke [who] tend to have more absent spells from work.\" Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:20:15.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
