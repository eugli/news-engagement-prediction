Well done Wasim bhai. What a day it was at the Kotla by Anil bhai.” \nRead more | India vs Bangladesh Test match, Day 1 highlights \nThe story quoted Akram as saying: “Kumble had got nine wickets and me and Waqar (Younis) were batting in the crease. Waqar came to me and said, ‘How about getting run out?’ so that Kumble does not get his 10th wicket. Kismat ke aage ,all saazish fail. Well done Wasim bhai. — Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) February 7, 2017 \n“I said ‘You can’t deny him the feat if he is destined for it. But I can assure you that I’m not going to give my wicket to Kumble’,” Akram said. “But subsequently it was me who gifted my wicket to Kumble,’’ he added. \nWaqar took to Twitter to deny the incident. “This never happened!! I think age is catching up with Wasim Bhai #NotTrue,” Waqar, the former Pakistan coach, tweeted. \nChasing 420 runs to win the Test, Pakistan were off to a solid start with openers Saeed Anwar and Shahid Afridi adding 101 runs for the opening wicket. But after Afridi fell for 41 to become Kumble’s first victim, Pakistan innings collapsed and eventually folded up for 207 as India won by 212 runs. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:53:48.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
