She is also responsible for the legal costs. \n“This is a huge victory for the Khoi and San people, which is a marginalised people. It is also a victory for justice. I truly believe in the justice system,” a delighted Stanley Peterson, a member of the National Khoi and San People, told News24 on Tuesday afternoon shortly after the verdict. \nLucas said: “Hotnots are only good for clothes and food.” At the time she was introducing John Block, provincial chairperson of the ANC in the Northern Cape, during a budget statement at the Eiland Holiday Resort on September 18 2010. The speech was broadcast on five community radio stations. \nPeterson, a former ANC member, took her to the South African Human Rights Commission. Both parties appeared before advocate Lawrence Mushawne, national chairperson of the HRC, in November 2011 during mediation. Lucas was advised to apologise, but no apology materialised. \n“This left me with no choice other than to approach the court, because nobody is above the law,” said Peterson. \nPeterson was represented by Legal Aid SA’ \n24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24 We reserve editorial discretion to decide what will be published.
