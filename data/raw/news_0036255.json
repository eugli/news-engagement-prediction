The tough old-fashioned cowboys defending freedom, determined to succeed.\nRegardless of the plot, for Saed it’s the theme behind the films that has him coming back for more: the notion that good always triumphs over evil.\n“You see American people in their real way of life. The way they live and give,” Saed said. “It makes me happy to watch these movies.\"\nSaed is the owner of Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli in Phoenix, the small business embraced by the Valley in December when it was twice vandalized after the presidential election, \nWhat had happened at the restaurant near 16th Street and Earll Drive could serve as a plot for a neo-traditional Western.\nThe \"bad guy\" who propelled a rock at the store’s front windows was run out of town by the heroes; the community spread the word on social media and came out in droves to show their support.\nSyrian Sweets Exchange Feb. 19: 10 am-noon, Dayspring United Methodist Church, 1365 E.

They showed the real way of American life,” Saed said, quickly getting emotional. “The love and support was overwhelming.”\nNow, Saed said he has been given the opportunity to pay it forward by getting involved in a project called the Syrian Sweets Exchange. \nIt’s a series of bake sales planned throughout metro Phoenix that will introduce traditional Syrian pastries made by Syrian refugees, many of whom arrived to Arizona in recent months.\nThe first official event is set to take place Sunday at the Dayspring United Methodist Church in Tempe.\nDifferent faith groups and organizations are scheduled to host the sales every two weeks until April while the organizers of the Syrian Sweets Exchange work to set up more dates.\nThe goal: Give newcomers a chance to meet more Arizonans, earn money Tan Jakwani (second from right), a Syrian Sweets Exchange organizer, smiles after sampling some of the goods during a meeting at the Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli in Phoenix.   (Photo: Hannah Gaber/The Republic) \nThe idea was started by volunteers in Phoenix and Tucson who stand in solidarity with Syrian refugees at a time when their future in the United States remains unknown.\nThe project's goal is to provide an opportunity for refugees to maintain their cultural identity and tradition, while also introducing the new families to the wider community, a challenge for many recent arrivals.\n“They are, to some extent, lost at sea on what to do,” said Saed, who was asked by the group to host and assist a training session for the bakers in his restaurant before the project began.\n“They are coming from Syria, where there is a totally different culture from what they are experiencing now. We’re giving them direction and giving them advice on how to conduct business.”\nMoney generated from the sales all go to the bakers, according to the organizers, to help them pay rent, transportation and basic living costs. In the long run, the project aims to help refugees establish their own home bakery businesses.\n“I’d just like to see peace in (the restaurant) and in the rest of the world,” Saed said. I’d like to see these people not having to suffer in order to live. I’d like to see them enjoy their lives and being able to look forward to tomorrow instead of fearing the tomorrow.”\nThe effort comes at an unsettling time for refugees.\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order Jan. 27 suspending the country's refugee resettlement program for 120 days. Arizona lawmakers are considering Senate Bill 1468, which would suspend Arizona's participation in the refugee resettlement program indefinitely and impose a fine of $1,000 a day per refugee on any charity or other group that provides services to refugees, including the people behind the bake sale.\n\"But good wins over evil every time,\" Saed said, saying fear won't stop the Syrian Sweets Exchange initiative.\nThe volunteers: Many recall their own immigrant experiences Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Supporters rally to help Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

It was one example of how she took care of her family on her own, as her husband lived thousands of miles away in the United States.\nThe children’s father had served in the South Vietnamese Army and was evacuated from the country at the end of the war in 1975, taking refuge in America.\nIt would take 10 years for his family to join him in Houston, where he was preparing for their future.\n“He always reminded us of the time when he first came to the United States,” Jakwani said. “He worked every job he could to rebuild his life for us. But he wouldn’t have been able to do it without the help he got from Americans.”\nJakwani said her family’s history, along with her own experiences as an immigrant, connects her with refugees who seek to begin their lives anew here.\nFor nine years, she has been working with refugees who have come to Phoenix from different parts of the world. A converted Muslim, she works as the outreach coordinator at the Islamic Center of Northeast Valley.\nShe also participates in various loosely organized groups. Of those, the Syrian Refugee Connection in Phoenix is where Jakwani came across a social media post created by members Nancy Speidel and Tracy Nishida, introducing the idea of a bake-sale project.\nThe women had shared an article of a successful bake sale in Tucson that had been put on by volunteers of the Arizona Welcome Refugees group. Syrian women were showcasing their talents and connecting with their new neighbors through the power of food.\nThey wondered if something similar could be repeated in the Phoenix area.\n“It just clicked,” Jakwani said. “I didn’t even ask them if they wanted help, I just told them I would.”\nJakwani reached out to the organizers in southern Arizona, and they agreed to share best practices and help kick off the idea in Phoenix.\nSpidell reached out to Saed after hearing about the vandalism on his business a few months prior, wondering if he might want to get involved.\nHe, too, said yes.\nThe refugees: 'I want to be an American,' says one woman hoping to sell pastries The Syrian Sweets Exchange is a series of bake sales planned throughout metro Phoenix that will introduce traditional Syrian pastries made by Syrian refugees, many of whom arrived to Arizona in recent months.   (Photo: Hannah Gaber/The Republic) \nThe indulgent smells lingered in the air at the Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli on Feb. 4.\nHoney. Cinnamon. Deep undertones of nuts. Sweet and spicy.\nIt’s a familiar scent in the shop that is known for its sweets. But it seemed intensified on this Saturday morning.\nRows of pastries took up the tables. Behind them sat the proud bakers who had been asked to bring a sample of what they would make for the bake sales.\nBaklava: Layers of buttered phyllo dough filled with pistachios and soaked in syrup.\nThe addictive, nutty Barazek: Cookies topped with a thick layer of sesame that is mixed with honey on one side, while the other is dotted with pistachios.\nDisplayed in front of Ladi Lazao were assorted maamoul — small shortbread pastries. One variety was filled with dates, the second with pistachios and the third, walnuts, the 24-year-old explained in Arabic, her words translated by a volunteer.\n“Please try it,” she insisted to the women sitting with her.\nLazao had left her home in Damascus, Syria, two years after the civil war started in 2011. She shared her story as other women stopped to listen and learn how her background was represented in what she had baked. She, her husband and their two daughters fled to Turkey, where they struggled for three years because her husband wasn't able to find work.\nAfter many applications, there were accepted to come to Phoenix six months ago, she said.\n\"American people have been very nice to us,\" Lazao said. \"We have felt that we are welcomed.\"\nThe transition has not been without hardship. Though her husband was able to find custodial work, they still struggle to make ends meet, she said, and the assimilation process into their new community has been slow.\nWhen Lazao was asked to join the baking project, she didn't hesitate.\n“I think this is a good opportunity to learn and to get started in the pastry business,\" she said. \"I get to meet other bakers and benefit from their experiences. We all have something to offer each other.\"\nBut above all, Lazao said she looks forward to how the baking project will give her an entrance into the American community that she has longed to join.\n\"I want to be an American, as well.\"\nThe climate: Uncertainty, anxiety and a desire to take action Fear and anxiety are common among current refugees, said Lama Hiraky, who was acting as a translator for the volunteers and the bakers at the restaurant.\nHiraky, who immigrated from Syria more than 20 years ago, said she interacts with many refugees through various programs.\n\"The uncertainty has been bad,\" Hiraky said. \"But they are comforted by the actions of Americans who have chosen to interact with them. It eases their mind.\"\nThe president's edicts have lit a fire, said Debbie Crenshaw, founder of the Syrian Refugee Connection in Phoenix.\n\"Trump's actions and the actions of anyone spreading hate will only make us work harder,\" Crenshaw said. \"More people will volunteer and more people will want to get involved.\"\nThat sentiment is what has propelled Rania Kanawati, one of the original coordinators of the Tucson bake sale, to continue the project.\nAfter seeing how Syrian families there helped build a stronger community through their home-baked goods, she wanted to share the success to other parts of the state and beyond.\n\"If we can have this in every major city, we can, together, build the world we want to see,\" Kanawati said.\nBakery owner: 'Good wins over evil' Isam Saed, owner of the Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli in Phoenix, speaks to participants in the Syrian Sweets Exchange program.   (Photo: Hannah Gaber/The Republic) \nSaed and his staff, who all come from different backgrounds themselves, spoke about best business practices as the women listened, excited to be a part of the project.\n\"The reason I am doing this is to show you how great and how kind the American people are,\" Saed said. \"I told you, good wins over evil.\"\nHe recalled a defining event from one of his early years in the country, after he had emigrated from Nazareth, Israel, to attend medical school. He almost died in a car accident in Kansas in 1967, Saed said.\nThe vehicle in which he and his friends were traveling slid across thick ice in subzero temperatures.\nA friend acted fast, he said, by kicking out the back window and running for help.\nBy the time the ambulance had reached the wreckage and arrived at the nearest hospital, he had lost two-thirds of his blood, Saed said.\nHis school community, friends and strangers — all Americans — tended to him as he recovered in his dormitory room, a cast covering the lower half of his body, Saed, now 70, recalled.\nBack at home in Israel, his family was experiencing the start of a major Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They had no idea what Saed was going through and they wouldn't know until his cast was removed months after the accident.\n\"It's the mindset of an immigrant,\" Saed said. \"I didn't want to worry them. I didn't want to add extra burden.\"\nThe preparations: Supporters assist with cost of ingredients, baking supplies After Saed and his staff spoke, Jakwani, Speidel and Nishida, with the help of other organizers Sadia Zubairi and Shy Khan, passed around baking supplies and $50 to each of the 17 bakers at his restaurant that day so that they could start buying ingredients.\nThe money was raised by the Islamic Center of the Northeast Valley, and the supplies had been donated online, Speidel told the women.\n\"The refugees are doing their part,\" Nishida said. \"Now, we hope the public does theirs.\"\n\"If you come and have a conversation with them, you'll see what they have been through and how amazing they are,\" she said. \"These people are so resilient. Just speaking to them will open your mind.\"\nCLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nMIDDLE EASTERN RESTAURANT VANDALIZED An 'outpouring of love' for Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli | 1:21 Supporters, old and new flock to the Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli after the central Phoenix restaurant was vandalized.
