Close Heather Mack admits to killing her mother in Bali UP NEXT VIDEO 21-year-old Heather Mack released a series of YouTube videos admitting to killing her mother in Bali after finding out that her mother was responsible for her father's death. Source: YouTube/ Heather Mack Heather Mack admits to killing her mother in Bali \nHeather Mack and Tommy Schaefer are both serving long sentences in Indonesia for the murder of Mack’s mother, Sheila von Wiese Mack, in Augyst of 2014. \nThe pair was found guilty of killing the 62-year-old former wife of jazz composer James L. Mack, and stuffing her body into a suitcase after an argument in an upmarket Bali hotel. \nNow, Heather Mack, 21, claims she acted alone and murdered her mother in retaliation for her murdering Mr Mack more than a decade ago; a version of events far removed from the official verdict. The official account says Sheila von Wiese-Mack was bludgeoned in the head. Her daughter now claims that was a ruse. Photo: AAP \n\"Two weeks before I came to Bali, I found out that she killed my father, and I made it up in my heart, in my mind, my soul, in my blood, in the oxygen running through my body, that I wanted to kill my mother,\" Heather Mack said in the videos \n\"I got this whole new savage idea in my head that I wanted to kill her in a hotel room, because she had killed my father in a hotel room. “ \nMr Mack’s death in an Athens hotel in August of 2006 was officially recorded as the result of a pulmonary embolism. Heather Mack confessed to killing her mother alone in a series of YouTube videos which appeared on February 2. Photos: YouTube \nHeather Mack said she had offered Schaefer $50,000 to kill her mother Sheila von Wiese-Mack but he had refused. \n“We were going to Bali, so I began to plot,\" he video statement continued. Australian woman dies in Thailand jet-ski crash \nOnce Ms von Wiese-Mack was dead, Heather Mack said she trapped Schaefer into helping her try to escape punishment and, once they were caught, into taking responsibility. \nMack said in her videos she told Schaefer she would pay police to frame him if he did not help her clear the crime scene. \nLater, as the pair faced court for their crimes, Mack claims she and her lawyer told Schaefer he had to confess to the murder or risk the death penalty. Then 21-year old Tommy Schaefer reacts to hearing his verdict in a Denpasar court in March 2015. Photo: Getty Images \nMack was sentenced to 10 years. Schaefer will be in prison for 18. \nAs the videos roll on Mack, at times appearing tearful, jabs her index finger into her throat as she assumes responsibility for the crime, and apologises to Schaefer, whom she says she loves. \nHer most recent version of events stands at odds with the official verdict, which said Ms von Wiese-Mack died after an argument with Schaefer spun out of control in the Bali’s five-star St Regis Hotel Heather Mack carries her baby Stella as she arrives at the Denpasar District Court to hear her verdict on April 21, 2015.

Sheila loved Jim very deeply and was devastated by his death. \n“We are also struck by the utter lack of any remorse from Heather over her mother's murder.\" \nHeather Mack and Tommy Schaefer’s case attracted world wide media attention, driven partially due to the savagery of the crime, the potential for death sentences and by the fact that Mack was pregnant, and then gave birth, behind bars. \nShe is now raising the baby, Stella, behind the walls of Keroboken prison.
