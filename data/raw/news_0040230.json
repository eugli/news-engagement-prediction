Four Republican senators on the committee — Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Tim Scott of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — have not committed to backing Mr. Puzder. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Collins said on Monday that she was “reviewing the other information that has come to light” and that she looked forward to exploring it at the hearing. Mr. Scott said that he wanted to see how Mr. Puzder performed in person before making a decision. However, he acknowledged that he had concerns about Mr. Puzder’s failure to pay taxes on an undocumented housekeeper. Although Mr. Puzder is not the first of Mr. Trump’s nominees to fail to pay taxes or employ an undocumented immigrant, critics say that the oversights are particularly egregious for a businessman who would lead the Labor Department. Ms. Murray said that the revelation about Mr. Puzder’s housekeeper, which emerged only last week, was ironic considering Mr. Trump’s promises to crack down on illegal immigration. Democrats are also expected to seize upon comments that Mr. Puzder has made in support of automation and his stances against overtime pay. The provocative television commercials featuring bikini-clad models eating juicy hamburgers that were produced by CKE during his tenure are also likely to come up. One news release in 2011 explained the company’s marketing strategy when it blared: “We believe in putting hot models in our commercials, because ugly ones don’t sell burgers.” Despite all of the criticism of Mr. Puzder, whose brash personality is sometimes compared to Mr. Trump’s, most Republicans and members of the business world have rallied around him. State restaurant groups in Maine and Alaska have sent letters to Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski to express support for Mr. Puzder, hailing him as an experienced job creator. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to lawmakers arguing that Mr. Puzder’s executive experience would make him less likely to impose onerous regulations.

Credit Al Drago/The New York Times “He will know better than any other secretary the impact that the department’s actions have on companies and the economy,” wrote Neil Bradley, the group’s chief policy officer. Even Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, emerged from the sidelines this week to urge Republicans to stick with Mr. Puzder. Pointing to the nominee’s humble beginnings, Mr. Romney said he was certain that Mr. Puzder could relate to the plight of regular workers. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “He knows how hard Americans work, and how much that work means to them and their families,” Mr. Romney wrote in a Facebook post . If Democrats are unsuccessful at blocking Mr. Puzder at the committee on Thursday, it will not be their final opportunity to pick off one of Mr. Trump’s top nominees. Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, who has been tapped to be the White House’s budget director, is expected to get a vote on Thursday from the full Senate. Mr. Mulvaney raised eyebrows at his confirmation hearing when he admitted that he did not pay taxes on a nanny his family employed. His backing of deep cuts to military spending rankled some Republicans, such as Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Armed Services Committee chairman, who accused him of showing insufficient support for the military. Mr. McCain described Mr. Mulvaney as “anti-defense” on Tuesday while he lamented his vote to remove troops from Afghanistan. The margin of error for Mr. Mulvaney’s confirmation appeared to have narrowed. “I’m voting against him — most likely,” Mr. McCain said. \nThomas Kaplan contributed reporting. \nGet politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter .
