And he incorporates all these familiar and inadequate responses into “Wakey, Wakey,” which opened on Monday night at the Pershing Square Signature Center , directed by its author. Video Excerpt: 'Wakey, Wakey' January LaVoy and Michael Emerson in a scene from this new Will Eno play at the Pershing Square Signature Center. By SIGNATURE THEATER on Publish Date February 26, 2017. . Because, really, what is there to say when you’re standing right next to death? That’s a question that no philosopher, physician or theologian has been able to answer with unconditional assurance. But the human urge is to keep thinking and talking, for as long as the expiring body allows. This is good news if you’re a character in a play by Mr. Eno, and embodied by Mr. Emerson, who together tap into the show business in the business of breathing your last. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Wakey, Wakey” might be described as a bookend to Mr. Eno’s breakout work, “Thom Pain (based on nothing),” described by Charles Isherwood in The New York Times as “stand-up existentialism.” That artfully meandering meditation on life’s futility had critics proclaiming its creator as an heir to Samuel Beckett (its title coolly and audaciously echoed that of Beckett’s “Texts for Nothing”), and it was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize . \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Wakey, Wakey” retains a Beckettian sense of human existence as an absurdist vaudeville, a slapstick of failing and falling, despite all aspirations to dignity. But I also found myself thinking of Edward Albee , whose plays often place death center stage (it was even the title character of his “The Lady From Dubuque” ), amid a host of bright conversationalists whose eloquence is a doomed defense. Mr. Eno cut a vivid and eccentrically respectful figure as one of the starry lineup of speakers at Mr. Albee’s memorial service last year. And “Wakey, Wakey” shares the Albee vision of words as matches struck and snuffed in the darkness. But Mr. Eno’s play is warmer and less magisterial than most of Mr. Albee’s work. You could even call it cozy, which is not to say it doesn’t chill. Subscribe to the Theater Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest news, interviews and reviews from Broadway and beyond.
