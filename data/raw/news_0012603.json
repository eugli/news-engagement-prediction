Trump's diplomacy has been under the spotlight in the last week after reports leaked of contentious phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia, two typically stalwart American allies.\nHowever, Trump had a friendly phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and it appears that Trump is looking toward Moscow to help fight terrorism abroad. Pence said it's all a part of Trump's attempts to defeat the Islamic State and form new relationships to help in that fight.\n\"We have to develop new coalitions and new partnerships to combat radical Islamic terrorism and particularly Russia and the U.S. have a common enemy in ISIS,\" Pence said. \"The president has made a priority of pulling together the world and the resources of the United States to hunt down and destroy ISIS so it can no longer threaten us or inspire violence in the homeland.\"\nPence also defended Trump's comments Sunday on CBS .\n\"We now have a president who is re-engaging a world from which America has been stepping back over the last eight years,\" the former Indiana governor said.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Bolton: Trump should 'tear up' the Iran nuclear deal Bolton called the Iran deal \"diplomatic malpractice.\"\nBy Pete Kasperowicz • 02/06/17 8:00 AM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:34:50.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
