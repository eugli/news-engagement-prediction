Four juveniles had either been in or just outside the house at the time, police said.\nOne of the children called 911 just before 10 p.m. When police officers arrived on scene near 63rd Avenue and Lower Buckeye Road, they encountered four children leaving the home unharmed, police said.\n\"The four children told officers that their mother and stepfather were arguing,\" said Sgt. Jonathan Howard, a spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department. \"They said they heard about four gunshots.\"\nOfficers entered the home to find the man and woman deceased.\nNeighbors at the couple's current and former homes all described a quiet pair who kept to themselves and had friendly children.\n\"They never caused any scenes and their children were always real sweet,\" Fernando Garcia said.\nGarcia said he was up with his daughter Monday night as she finished a school project when she told him that she heard gunshots.\n\"I told her that I thought it was the TV,\" Garcia said. \"When I checked outside, I saw Phoenix police swarming around and pulling up real fast.\"\nPolice said the couple's children were in the care of their grandparents on Tuesday, and the investigation is ongoing.\nCheck back with azcentral.com for more details.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:08:45.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
