This is not acceptable and can no longer continue.\nNova Scotia Teachers Union President Liette Doucet released a statement shortly afterward saying they learned about the legislatures recall through the government statement.\n“This is consistent with the McNeil government’s well documented lack of respect for the collective rights of workers,” the statement reads.\n“A legislated contract will do nothing to improve the state of our schools and will only further erode the trust between teachers and the government.”\nRelated Stories NSTU and provincial government not commenting on future of contract dispute N.S. teachers vote to reject government’s third contract offer Parents hold rally for teachers ahead of vote on tentative agreement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:58:58.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
