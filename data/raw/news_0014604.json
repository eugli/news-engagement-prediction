(Photo: Ed Reinke, Associated Press) \nHOUSTON – Kickers are Hall-of-Famers, too. \nFormer Michigan State star Morten Andersen became the second true kicker elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday when he was one of five modern-era players to receive at least 80% of the final ballot. \nAndersen is the NFL’s all-time leading scorer and a member of two different all-decade teams (the 1980s and ‘90s). He played 25 seasons for five different teams, and joins Jan Stenerud as the only kickers in the Hall of Fame. \n“Growing up as a kid I remember watching him play thinking, ‘Man, this guy’s the best guy,’” Indianapolis Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri said this week on radio row at Super Bowl LI. “He had all the kicks and he was just so good for so long.” \nAndersen, who made seven Pro Bowls, was one of the most dangerous long-range kickers during his time in the NFL. \nHe had 40 50-plus-yard field goals at the time of his retirement, a record that was eventually surpassed by former Lions kicker Jason Hanson. \nIn college, Andersen, a native of Denmark, played four seasons at Michigan State in 1978-81, where he was an All-America selection as a senior. \nVinatieri said this week that he was pulling for Andersen to be elected to Canton in part to open the door for other specialists. \n“I sit there and go, if you can do anything for 25 years, I don’t care what your job is, but if you’re a great surgeon for 25 years I think there’d be books written about you,” Vinatieri said. “So he leads the league in points and 25 years’ worth, yeah, I think it’s a no-brainer.” \nAlong with Andersen, running backs LaDainian Tomlinson and Terrell Davis, defensive end Jason Taylor and quarterback Kurt Warner were elected to the Hall. Safety Kenny Easley was chosen as a seniors committee nominee, and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was chosen as a contributor. \nFormer NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue was passed over in the contributor’s category, and ex-Michigan cornerback Ty Law was eliminated in the reduction from 10 to five finalists. \nContact Dave Birkett: .
