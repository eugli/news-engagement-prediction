Look what happened to the Holy Roman Empire” Sufjan Stevens Photo by Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images \nSufjan Stevens has been using his Tumblr account to pen various notes as of late, speaking from his Christian background on subjects such as the Ten Commandments and the refugee crisis . Now, in a new “friendly reminder,” Stevens has addressed other Christians. “A ‘Christian Nation’ is absolutely heretical. Christ did not come into this world to become a modifier. Look at what happened to the Holy Roman Empire,” he wrote. “To gain access to true love and true self, you must die to yourself, to your family, your heritage, your narrow-minded ideology, your ego, your ill-conditioned consciousness, and your false identity.” \nLater on, Stevens continues, “When Jesus Christ says, ‘Render to Caesar that which is Caesar’s,’ he acknowledges a necessary evil (and throws some shade), but he also compels us to participate honestly and responsibly and with righteousness and stewardship in a faulty and dysfunctional society even as we are called to be ideologically and socially dispossessed... The life your live is not your own. Give your life away.” Read the full note here .
