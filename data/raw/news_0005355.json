Patty Murray, the committee’s top Democrat, ‘‘Every child deserves to attend school in a safe, supportive environment where they can learn, thrive, and grow.’’\nThe Quote: appears to closely track a statement by Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, who said in a May press release , ‘‘Every child deserves to attend school in a safe, supportive environment that allows them to thrive and grow.’’\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller.

These heartfelt words are not the domain of any one individual,’’ Goad said in a statement. ‘‘To level an accusation against her about these words included in responses to nearly 1,400 questions — 139 alone from the ranking member — is simply a desperate attempt to discredit Betsy DeVos, who will serve the Department of Education and our nation’s children with distinction if confirmed.’’\nThis isn’t the first time when Trump’s team has had to fight off plagiarism allegations. Melania Trump was accused of copying parts of Michele Obama’s speech during her remarks at the Republican National Convention over the summer.\nAlso, conservative commentator Monica Crowley had been tapped to be director of strategic communications at the National Security Council but withdrew from consideration after accusations of plagiarism.\nRelated Senate panel approves Betsy DeVos for education secretary", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F01%2F31%2Fdevos-may-have-used-obama-official-remarks-without-attribution%2FvyAYEjp66jRJB9K5vvZKdK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=DeVos", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=DeVos", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F01%2F31%2Fdevos-may-have-used-obama-official-remarks-without-attribution%2FvyAYEjp66jRJB9K5vvZKdK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=DeVos", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F01%2F31%2Fdevos-may-have-used-obama-official-remarks-without-attribution%2FvyAYEjp66jRJB9K5vvZKdK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F01%2F31%2Fdevos-may-have-used-obama-official-remarks-without-attribution%2FvyAYEjp66jRJB9K5vvZKdK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tDeVos"], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T08:56:44.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
