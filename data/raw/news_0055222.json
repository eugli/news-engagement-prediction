Robert Cumming and Const. Bryan Morton in November 2015.\nCumming, 44, was arrested June 3, 2016, and charged with breach of trust, theft under $5,000 and possession of a controlled substance.\nCalgary police officer accused of stealing seized marijuana\nMorton also faces criminal charges of criminal harassment, breach of trust, bribery and unauthorized use of a computer system, though they are unrelated to Cumming's.\nRobert Cumming is on trial on charges of breach of trust, theft under $5,000 and possession of a controlled substance. (Facebook)\nIn November 2015, Staff Sgt. Jeff MacQueen was tasked with looking into any drug-related calls responded to by Cumming and Morton between 2013 and 2015.\nOn June 3, 2016, after he received the backpack full of marijuana, Cumming drove to his home where officers from a surveillance unit observed him dumping everything into the garbage outside his home, according to MacQueen. Cumming returned to work, finished his shift and then returned home where he then took the drugs out of the garbage.\nCumming smelled like alcohol when arrested During his arrest several hours later, Cumming smelled like alcohol and was slurring his words and said he was \"f**ked\" and that his \"life was over,\" according to MacQueen.\nLethbridge Provincial Court Judge Jerry LeGrandeur is presiding over the judge-alone trial and a Crown from Edmonton is prosecuting the case because of the conflict given Cumming is a police officer.\nAll of the Crown's evidence is being held in a voir dire — a hearing to determine if the evidence is admissible. Cumming's lawyer is challenging the admissibility and will argue his client was entrapped — set up by fellow officers.\nSeveral officers and former officers who are or have been charged with crimes showed up at court on Tuesday, including Gerard Brand, Bryan Morton and Steve Walton.\nOfficers in court 'for support' Brand, who had been accused of illegally accessing CPS computer system information and selling it to a private company, was acquitted of corruption charges in November.\nWalton, his wife and Morton are all facing corruption, harassment and breach of trust allegations in connection to a private investigation firm.\nThe officers are in the courtroom \"for support,\" according to Walton.\nCumming was suspended from duty.\nAn investigation by the professional standards section will begin once the criminal process is complete.\nThe Crown plans to call 12 witnesses.\nMORE POLICE NEWS | 13 Calgary police members file bullying complaints urging cultural, leadership changes MORE POLICE NEWS | Calgary mother appeals for return of dead teen son's funeral mementoes", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:24:59.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
