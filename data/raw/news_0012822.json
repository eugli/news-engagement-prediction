Most Popular By Sophie Weiner Feb 5, 2017 On Thursday, a large chunk of the cliff above a lava flow pouring into the ocean from Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano gave way , falling into the ocean below and blocking the dramatic lava 'firehose' that had drawn tourists and geologists from around the world. Lava was still pouring into the ocean underwater, but it was thought that the cliff collapse would block the firehose spectacle. A few days later, it seems that prediction was wrong. A video taken by Kalapana Cultural Tours from a boat on Saturday showed the firehose stream alive and well.   \"Guests were surprise to see the lava fire hose lava still active,\" the local tour company posted on Facebook. Most Popular The solid-looking stream of lava pouring into the water is quite a sight, but the attention the it's getting from tourists is concerning officials. The US Geological Survey warned after the cliff collapse that many hazards remained. \"This collapse yesterday did not diminish the hazards,\" USGS geologist Janet Babb told the AP. \"As long as lava continues to flow into the ocean, that area is still quite hazardous... there's still potential for collapses of the sea cliff there.\" Tourists should stay out of the area to avoid the danger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:41:53.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
