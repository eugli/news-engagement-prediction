The father-of-two died of an infection Monday\nClinging to life: The long-haul truck driver spent four days in a Utah hospital, where doctors tried and failed to stop the spread of an infection that originated in his tooth\nThe trouble began when Vadim began complaining of the toothache two weeks ago.\nOn his way to New York in his truck, Vadim's pain gradually grew worse, forcing him to seek dental help in Oklahoma.\nThe dentist Vadim visited cleaned his infected tooth and proscribed him antibiotics for the infection.\nAt first, the treatment seemed to work and he reached New York feeling much better, but as he set out on the return trip back to the west coast, the side of his face became swollen.\nGirls' guardian angel: Nataliya is now left to raise the couple's two daughters, two-year-old Vanessa (left) and 11-month-old Maya (right)\nYoung widow: Nataliya, pictured with Vadim during happier times. She has received almost $250,000 in donations from well-wishers to help the family get through these difficult times\nHis brother-in-law, Miroslav Kondratyuk, rushed to Vadim's side hoping to bring him home faster for treatment, but his condition was deteriorated so rapidly the pair were forced to stop in Utah and check into a hospital.\nFor four days, doctors tried to stem the infection but to no avail: Vadim's lungs ultimately filled up with fluid, rendering him unable to breathe.\nHe died on Monday with his wife, Nataliya at his bedside.\n‘I don't think you could find a better husband,’ the young widow tearfully said of Vadim. 'I know he's in heaven. He's a happy person right now. He's gonna be my angel for the rest of my life.’\nHappiest day: The young couple were married for four years and lived in Antelope, California\nA GoFundMe page set up to help bring Vadim’s body home to California, to pay for his funeral expenses and to provide for his widow and their two children, has raised almost $250,000.\nThe money will become all the more important for Vadim's family who are now without a breadwinner.\nThe young widow, will be left to raise the couple's two daughters, two-year-old Vanessa and 11-month-old Maya.", "external_links": ["https://www.gofundme.com/support-vadim-kondratyuks-family", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-03T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:19:41.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
