This makes the project the first and only album to ever reach this milestone in American music. \"The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has certified the set at 33-times platinum in the U.S., extending Thrillerâ€™s record as the highest certified album in history,\" the publication claims . \n\"That means Thriller -- released in 1982 -- has earned 33 million equivalent album units in the U.S. That sum blends traditional album sales (one album sale equals one unit), tracks sold from an album (10 tracks sold equals one unit) and on-demand audio and/or video streams (1,500 streams equals one unit).\" Epic Records chairman Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid , Sony Music CEO Doug Morris , Sony Music CEO Rob Stringer and more toasted the momentous occasion with a brand new plague. \nSince Jackson's death, Thriller has become the highest selling album of all time with over 105 million albums sold worldwide. \nPhoto: Getty Images", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:25:19.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
