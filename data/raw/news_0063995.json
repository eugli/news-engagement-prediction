Howard is the consensus No. 1 tight end in this year's NFL Draft class. \nThe 6-foot-6, 251-pound Alabama product has the rare blend of size, speed and athleticism to be a mismatch machine at the next level. Earlier today, FOX Sports: PROcast tweeted out a video of Howard catching blistering passes from a JUGS machine at a frighteningly close distance: WOW! \n60 MPH out of the jugs gun— no wonder @TheRealOJHoward is the #1 TE prospect in the #NFLDraft (feat. @darealmike_dub and @D_shorts6 ) pic.twitter.com/yDhUD8eshc \n— FOX Sports: PROcast (@PROcast) February 23, 2017 \nAccording to the tweet, those footballs were being gunned out at roughly 60 mph! Since 2008, just two quarterbacks have thrown a ball that fast at the NFL Combine . Odds are, their target wasn't standing within spitting distance. Also, peep that ridiculous one-handed grab Howard makes at the start of the video. I didn't think physics worked like that. Howard showed off his incredibly strong hands in a video last week: BEAST! \n. @TheRealOjHoward demonstrates why he's the top TE prospect in the 2017 #NFLDraft ! \nTag the @NFL team that should draft OJ. pic.twitter.com/UbtCzYOLdQ \n— FOX Sports: PROcast (@PROcast) February 17, 2017 \nPlate Flips with a 55-pound plate? That's no joke. All signs indicate that Howard will have a brilliant showing next week at the 2017 NFL Combine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:24:00.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
