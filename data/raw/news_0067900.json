O’Neill acknowledged the initial estimate was $35 million in December , but the tab turned out lower “after an extensive analysis of payrolls, overtime sheets, and over 25,000 individual patrol log entries.” \nDe Blasio in December asked Congress to reimburse New York $35 million. \nThe feds only approved $7 million, partly because officials wanted to see proof of actual costs. \nOne Republican source called the $35 million figure a “back-of-the-envelope number thrown out by the Mayor’s ­Office.” \nNew York is now requesting the remaining $18.7 million. \nNYPD’s daily cost to secure the skyscraper is $127,000 to $146,000 and $4.5 million annually for FDNY, O’Neill said.
