A 26-year-old left-hander, Flynn was expected to compete for a spot in the Royals’ bullpen this spring. \n“He was working on his barn and fell through the roof,” Yost said. “So he took a pretty good tumble, knocked himself out. So he’s going to be about eight weeks behind everybody else.” ESPN predicts 2017 MVP for every MLB team Start SlideShow \nAfter having cups of coffee with the Marlins in 2013 and 2014, Flynn made his major league debut with the Royals in 2016, throwing 55 1/3 innings with an ERA of 2.60, striking out 7.2 batters per nine innings and walking 3.7. He was drafted out of Wichita State University in the seventh round of the 2011 MLB June Amateur Draft by the Detroit Tigers.
