She recently reconnected with Luke Skywalker at the end of The Force Awakens , but the title implies Luke might not be around long. No Star Wars legend is safe as long as Kylo Ren remains on the path of the Dark Side - as proven when Ren, the grandson of Darth Vader, fatally struck down Han Solo, his own father, in The Force Awakens . \nThen again, sometimes the Force speaks to you in another language. — Star Wars España (@StarWarsSpain) February 17, 2017 \nREAD MORE: * Star Wars fans in frenzy over Snoke rumour \nThe official Spain Star Wars Twitter account recently tweeted the Spanish version of the title for Star Wars episode eight. Whereas in English, The Last Jedi alludes to the possibility of only one Jedi left standing, the Spanish title, Los Ultimos Jedi , refers to the Jedi in the plural sense. If they were referring to only one Jedi, the title would read El Ultimo Jedi . \nFans were also quick to point out the discrepancy in other languages, such as German and French. NOT A DRILL I REPEAT THIS IS NOT A DRILL! \"THE LAST JEDI\" IS PLURAL. #StarWars pic.twitter.com/kkVGLK9mT0 — queen of winter (@argonautiche) February 17, 2017 #StarWars #TheLastJedi is #plural ! The German title, as well as the French, confirmed it!

In their first battle in The Force Awakens , Kylo Ren was injured and Rey was not even trained in the ways of the Jedi. The two were separated as the planet they fought on began to collapse due to ruptured fuel cells. \nThe next time Kylo Ren and Rey meet, Kylo will surely have had more practice with the Dark Side, and Rey more than likely will have received some expert Jedi training. \nThe only question is will Luke Skywalker be there when Kylo Ren and Rey meet again. - The Washington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:35:45.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
