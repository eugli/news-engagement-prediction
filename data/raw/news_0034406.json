Reportedly, President Trump was not amused by Melissa McCarthy's surprise turn as Press Secretary Sean Spicer in the previous episode—specifically because Spicer was played by a woman.We . The cold open of this SNL episode brings back McCarthy as Spicer and adds a portrayal of new Attorney General Jeff Sessions by a very female Kate McKinnon.McCarthy's second go at Spicer pokes fun at Trump's travel ban—\"If the appeals court won't do what's right, President Trump will see them in court. Specifically, the People's Court \"—Spicer's volatile attitude, his difficulty pronouncing foreign names, and his apparent disdain for the media. \"Spicy's going to explain it so you dumb babies can understand it,\" McCarthy-as-Spicer says. \"I'm gonna have to use my dollies.\"After demonstrating policy with action figures and a Moana doll, McCarthy throws in an extra jab about accusations that White House officials have unethically endorsed Ivanka Trump's brand. Showing off a Trump bracelet, McCarthy coos, \"It's beautiful, it's shimmery, it's elegant, and it's $39.99.\"Then McKinnon arrives to deliver a barely discernible racist diatribe in a thick Southern accent, and there it is: President Trump's least favorite sketch ever.Watch the Saturday Night Live cold open when video becomes available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T12:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T07:45:26.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
