A revolution in knot theory November 10, 2011 \nIn the 19th century, Lord Kelvin made the inspired guess that elements are knots in the \"ether\". Hydrogen would be one kind of knot, oxygen a different kind of knot---and so forth throughout the periodic table of elements. ... Knots in chaotic waves July 29, 2016 \nNew research, using computer models of wave chaos, has shown that three-dimensional tangled vortex filaments can in fact be knotted in many highly complex ways. Mobius strip ties liquid crystal in knots to produce tomorrow's materials and photonic devices August 20, 2013 \nUniversity of Warwick scientists have shown how to tie knots in liquid crystals using a miniature Möbius strip made from silica particles. January 20, 2016 \nThe very first experimental observations of knots in quantum matter have just been reported in Nature Physics. Team finds most complex protein knot ever seen September 20, 2006 \nAn MIT team has discovered the most complicated knot ever seen in a protein, and they believe it may be linked to the protein's function as a rescue agent for proteins marked for destruction. Recommended for you New study shows that proteins are 'virtually' knotted February 13, 2017 \nMany of the processes essential to life involve proteins - long molecules which 'fold' into three-dimensional shapes allowing them to perform their biological role. Researchers invent process to produce renewable car tires from trees, grass February 10, 2017 \nA team of researchers, led by the University of Minnesota, has invented a new technology to produce automobile tires from trees and grasses in a process that could shift the tire production industry toward using renewable ... Liposomes modified with temperature-responsive polymers are tuned for cellular uptake February 10, 2017 \n(Phys.org)—Drug delivery is tricky because the therapeutic compound needs to be non-toxic and deliver the correct dosage at the correct time. Some therapeutics are chemically unstable and others do not have the correct ... 50 year-old protein volume paradox resolved February 10, 2017 \nDurable proteins make life possible in the crushing depths of the ocean, and may have evolved in life below the surface of ice-bound oceanic exo-planets. These proteins stay folded - allowing them to perform their function—under ... Bacteria fed synthetic iron-containing molecules turn into electrical generators February 9, 2017 \nThe bacterial world is rife with unusual talents, among them a knack for producing electricity. In the wild, \"electrogenic\" bacteria generate current as part of their metabolism, and now researchers at the University of California, ... New method of genetic engineering indispensable tool in biotechnological applications February 9, 2017 \nResearch by Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Huimin Zhao and graduate student Behnam Enghiad at the University of Illinois is pioneering a new method of genetic engineering for basic and applied biological ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:08:39.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
