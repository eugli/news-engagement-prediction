Merchant's Retail Partners Big-box retailer Academy Sports + Outdoors is planning a big one-two punch to enter the Raleigh-area retail market. Construction drawings for new stores in both Apex and Wake Forest are being finalized and could be ready for contractors by summer, according to recent planning documents filed in both towns. Academy Sports + Outdoors is planning at least two new stores in Apex and Wake Forest. Merchant's Retail Partners In Apex, lease negotiations are underway for Academy Sports to take over a new 64,327-square-foot building planned at Nichols Plaza, next to the new Costco wholesale store on U.S. 64. In Wake Forest, negotiations are underway for the Texas-based sporting goods store to open in a new building at the planned Wake Union Place retail development at 12415 Capital Blvd. The property was formerly the site of the Parker-Hannifin manufacturing plant and is across from the Kohl’s-anchored Wake Forest Crossing shopping center. Michael Clark , a senior planning official in Apex, confirms that developers for the proposed 64,000-square-foot store at Nichols Plaza submitted final construction drawings for signatures Feb. 14. “Once the final details are confirmed, the plans will get signed and construction will likely get started very quickly,” Clark says. Since it is a minor site plan submission, it requires only staff review. Academy Sports + Outdoors opened its first store in North Carolina in 2012, and in November it opened its fifth and sixth stores in the state in Greenville and in Jacksonville. The company is allegedly also scoping out sites in Burlington and in Wilmington, according to local news reports. Each store employs about 100 people. A spokeswoman for Academy Sports was unavailable for comment. The company, which competes directly with Dick’s Sporting Goods, specializes in carrying an assortment of hunting, fishing, sports, recreation and leisure products. It operates more than 225 stores in 16 states and in 2016 had sales that exceeded $4.6 billion. Amanda Hoyle covers commercial and residential real estate.
