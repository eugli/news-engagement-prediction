The floors, walls and ceilings should be made of smooth materials; they should be easy to clean, non-absorbent of water, fire-resistant, light-coloured, non-toxic and without cracks,” said Al Shamsi.\nCross-contamination\nThe health and safety rules do not stop there: Food trucks must also provide appropriate ventilation and lighting.\nAccording to Dubai’s rules, there should also be a double sink for washing small equipment that is situated close to the preparation area.\n“It is also required to provide sufficient and appropriate places for storing one-time use packaging materials, and the equipment should be conveniently distributed inside the vehicle, so as to separate the various operations to prevent cross-contamination. It is not allowed to prepare raw materials, thawed meat, poultry and fish in the mobile truck,” said Al Shamsi.\nShe pointed out that the activity of food trucks should be limited to heating operations, simple barbecues and fry-ups for ready-made meals like burgers, sausages and French fries.\n“It is not allowed to clean and wash the vegetables in the mobile trucks, and all vegetables must be sorted, cleaned, sterilised and stored in clean covered containers outside the vehicle, in a licensed and secure place in order to avoid cross-contamination,” she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:22:37.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
