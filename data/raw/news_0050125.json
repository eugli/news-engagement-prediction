Where do I sign?”\nConte had warned his captain, leader, legend and reserve centre-back that he will not pick teams on sentiment as the Blues bid to become only the third club to win the Double twice.\nBut as Terry, 36, rode out the storm at Molineux and marshalled Chelsea’s 15th clean sheet this season, Conte was forced to confront a familiar conundrum.\nAntonio Conte applauds the travelling Blues fans (Photo: Chelsea FC via Getty Images) Read More Wolves 0-2 Chelsea: Diego Costa and Pedro goals keep double hopes alive Chelsea and Terry are like Dick Whittington and his cat – inseparable. Every time you think his nine lives at Stamford Bridge are up, he gets another one.\nThis was only Terry’s third appearance in 2017 and Conte warned: “I want to be very clear – if every player deserves to play, I am pleased to give them the opportunity, but not because there is sentiment or I think the right way is to give every single player what they deserve.\n“John Terry deserved to play this game and he did very well so I am very happy for him. For me, he remains a very important player, he’s my captain and he’s important on and off the pitch.\n“He’s helping me a lot, I’m very pleased to have him in my squad and also to know this type of person.”\nTerry and Begovic after keeping Wolves at bay (Photo: Chelsea FC via Getty Images) For all Conte’s kind words, there was no promise of a new contract when Terry’s one-year deal runs out this summer as he added: “For John, but also for all of the players, it is very important to stay focused on the present.\n“We are in a good position, we stay top of the table and we are in the quarter-final of the FA Cup, so the most important thing is now – to build a good future.\n“Then, yeah, for sure we will look at the situation of each player and we will try to make the best decision for every single one of them.”\nGoalkeeper Asmir Begovic, restricted to six cup appearances for Chelsea this season, said of Terry’s enduring influence: “He’s still got it, he’s the best defender in Premier League history and he’s ready when we need him.\n“What he’s got in mind for the future only he can answer, but I can see him continuing to play and I don’t see why he should quit – but maybe if he lifts two trophies at the end of the season, that would be a great way to go out as well!”\nConte's men continue looking for the double (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) Read More Antonio Conte watches Fulham vs Tottenham - but who was he keeping an eye on? In front of Molineux’s biggest crowd for 36 years, Chelsea were poor for 45 minutes but gradually suppressed Wolves’ spirit before asserting their authority in the last half-hour.\nUltimately, class told and the Blues refused to join the cast of Premier League clubs who have frittered away the chance of Cup glory on the altar of wholesale changes or complacency.\nTerry said: “The FA Cup means a lot to us, it’s a massive part of the club’s history. I’ve been lucky enough to win it five times - we see with the results today that the foreign guys don’t really understand.”\nGoals from foreign guys Pedro and Diego Costa took Conte a step closer to matching Carlo Ancelotti’s Double in 2010, leaving Wolves boss Paul Lambert to hope his Chinese paymasters were impressed.\nSpaniard Pedro put the Blues in front (Photo: PA) Diego Costa had the final say at Molineux (Photo: Rex Features) Lambert's side fell away in the second period (Photo: REUTERS) Lambert met Wang Qunbin, president of the club’s owners Fosun International, for the first time on Saturday and said: “I think it’s important for the owners to see what this place can be like when it’s full. If we get in the Premier League, there will be many more nights like this.\n“A lot of people might be scratching their heads about our League position (19th in the Championship, five points above the drop zone), but if we play like that, there won’t be a problem.”\nWolves midfielder George Saville, who began his career at Chelsea but left in 2014 without making a first-team appearance, rattled the post after only five minutes. It turned out to be their best chance.\nSaville said: “If that shot goes in, it’s a different ball game. But we were the better side for an hour and pushed the best side in the country all the way.”\npoll loading Will Chelsea win the Double this season? 500+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Chelsea FC Newsletter Follow @mirrorfootball Subscribe to our Chelsea FC Carlo Ancelotti Antonio Conte Diego Costa John Terry Paul Lambert FA Cup Premier League Chelsea FC Romance", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=mirrorfootball", "https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2017-02-20T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:32:57.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
