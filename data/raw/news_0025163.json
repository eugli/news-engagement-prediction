Feb. 10, 2017, 3:28 p.m. Trump and Abe awkwardly shake hands and Twitter loves it Nina Agrawal \nThe U.S. president and Japan's prime minister met Friday. On the agenda were major world issues, including trade, the future of the U.S.-Japan security alliance and disputed islands in the East China Sea. \nBut at least in the world of social media, the biggest news was the handshake between the two world leaders at a photo-op in the Oval Office. \nPresident Trump took Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's hand and they shook. And shook. And shook some more. \nWith cameras clicking wildly they kept at it for 19 seconds, with the president patting the prime minister's hand intermittently and awkwardly jerking Abe's hand forward at one point. \nWhen they finally let go, Abe sat back in his chair and appeared to roll his eyes and sigh -- perhaps in relief, perhaps as a joke. \nThe exchange prompted a flurry of reactions on social media.
