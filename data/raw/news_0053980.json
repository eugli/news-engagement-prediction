What is Acute Torticollis? \nTorticollis comes from two Latin words: torti (twisted) and collis (neck). Acute torticollis is a condition sometimes called wry neck. It is a painful muscle spasm in the neck, similar to having a charlie horse in your leg. \nAcute torticollis is a temporary condition that normally takes approximately two weeks to resolve. \nCauses attributed to acute torticollis include viral infection, anxiety, sleeping in an awkward position, and injury to neck or shoulder. Sometimes when people develop acute torticollis the cause is unfounded. \nMy first experience with torticollis was developing it overnight and awakening with a stiff and painful neck in my twenties. It occurred after spending the previous day outdoors. It was extremely windy that day. On another occasion after having slept with an open window that brought a cool draft into the bedroom I awoke another painful bout of torticollis. For this reason I associate the change of season (winter to spring) or change in temperature (warmth to chilling) as a possible onset to this condition. Pain is Your Body's Way of Communicating \nAny time your body is experiencing pain or distress try to think of it an opportunity to become a more active caregiver of your needs. Pain is merely a communication tool the body uses to let you know something needs your attention. \nThe acute attack of pain that is typical of torticollis is probably an indicator that you are in need of rest. Take this time to pamper yourself for a few days and allow your body's natural defenses to kick in. Get to bed early or indulge in a late afternoon power nap . \nAs the spasms subside and the pain lessens consider getting a chiropractic examination. A spinal adjustment can be beneficial in returning you and your body back to state of well-being. Chiropractor, Dr. David Miller, suggests any adjustment for relief of acute torticollis be held off for a few days following the onset of torticollis, to avoid inflaming or angering painful neck muscles and tissues during the acute stage of this condition.
