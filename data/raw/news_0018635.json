Both condemned the comments made at the previous night’s meeting, the ABC reported. \n“No matter how much I celebrate free speech, they were absolutely out of line,” Bernardi said, according to the ABC . \nThe comments of Pickering and Cameron have outraged those campaigning for LGBTI rights. \nThe Just.equal managing director, Ivan Hinton-Teoh, said it was appalling that in 2017 any Australian would find humour or common ground with the murder of gay people in the Middle East. \nHinton-Teoh said the comments “left me cold”. \n“In our nation’s recent history we know many gay men were routinely attacked and thrown to their deaths for being gay, so for many of us it’s not conceptual,” he told Guardian Australia. \n“Did the audience laugh? Did they think it was funny that their disdain for gay people was shared with Isis? Did any of them quietly yearn for the good ol’ days when Australians were thrown to their death for being gay? \n“It left me cold that we still have such a willingness to laugh at the violence we experience, rather than collectively recoil and commit to never again having such contempt for human life.” Deep Water: were 30 unsolved Sydney deaths really gay hate crimes? Read more \nThe Australian Marriage Equality co-chair, Alex Greenwich, also condemned the comments. Greenwich said his group believed in respectful debate. \n“To in any way suggest or promote violence against someone because they are gay is extreme, dangerous and unAustralian,” Greenwich said. \nHinton-Teoh criticised political leaders for not immediately condemning the comments. He said Australia needed to unify against such hatred and intolerance if it was to truly progress as a nation. \n“This is no laughing matter and the impact is only amplified when it’s met by silence from political leaders,” \n“When our prime minister, the member for Wentworth, found his mojo in parliament this week, not a word was said in horror of the comments made about his own constituents. \n“Imagine if, rather than reading stories of jokes about our deaths, young LGBTI Australians saw our leaders in full flight in question time, defending the sanctity of their lives.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:54:30.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
