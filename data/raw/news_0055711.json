(Picture: Rebellion) \nHave you mastered the art of being a sniper? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. \nThe new Sniper Elite 4, released by Rebellion on PC, PS4 and Xbox One on February 14, is a game of patience, skill and weapon mastery – but we all have to start somewhere. \nIt may be a bit daunting picking up your M1903 Springfield for the very first time, but, with a bit of practice, you’ll be hammering those dead-eye targets in no time. \nHere’s my guide to landing the perfect shot – and it all starts with the practice area. Head to the shooting range (Picture: Rebellion) \nI know, I know – you’d much rather rack up head shots on Nazi officers, but you should head straight to the shooting range instead. \nFor one thing, you can brush up on your technique. \nBut more importantly, you get a nice chunk of XP by nabbing gold medals on the weapon ranges. \nIt shouldn’t take you very long to master the rifle, pistol and sub-machine gun, but you’ll jump straight to Private Mark 2 with $3 to spend on gear. \nAnd you’ll want to put it towards your first upgrade. Buy suppressed rifle ammo (Picture: Rebellion) \nSniper Elite 4 favours a silent approach, so you’ll definitely want to use suppressed ammo. \nIt’s a one-time purchase for $4 and it allows you to equip two pouches of silent ammo as part of your load out. \nEquip it in-game by bringing up the weapon wheel and selecting it in your rifle, then you’re ready to go. \nYou don’t get as much of it as regular ammo but it’s great for taking out targets without being seen or heard. \nBut be warned – head shots on helmets will make a noise. \nThat’s right – nearby soldiers will quickly realise that their buddies have a hole in their head if you’re not too careful. \nSo if you find yourself picking off Nazis in a well-populated area, go for chest shots instead. \nBut what if you’re out of suppressed ammo? Mask your rifle shots with loud noises (Picture: Rebellion) \nEven after a trip to the shooting range, you won’t be able to buy that suppressed ammo right away. \nBut don’t worry – you can still take out Nazis unseen and unheard by timing the shots to coincide with loud environmental noises. \nSan Celini, the very first mission in Sniper Elite 4, features regular aeroplane flybys. \nIf you wait long enough, you’ll see a white noise icon appear at the top of the screen as those planes fly overhead – this is the time to strike.
