Looking on is MPHTJ president Datuk Murad Husin. \nNevertheless, Ismail said water samples from the fountain have been sent to the Health Ministry for a second laboratory test. \n“The first test proved that the water was not contaminated but we are doing it a second time following reports of a rotavirus outbreak,” he said, adding that the result of the second test would be known in a week. \nIsmail said there was no truth to reports that a rotavirus outbreak had caused several children to seek treatment in Hospital Malacca. \nHe said a signboard prohibiting the public from bathing in the fountain will also be erected while the splash mechanism in the fountain has been discontinued. \nA notice had earlier been put up by the local authority advising the public against bathing at the site. \nEarlier, some 59 agencies, companies and hotels received awards in various categories, including best taxpayer, highest contributor, active media, best stall and low carbon community at the event. \nMamee Double Decker and Bayou Lagoon Park were among the recipients for highest tax contributors to the council. \nThe Star’s Malacca Bureau also won an award in the active media category.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:39:04.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
