But her fans were in for a treat on Thursday evening as the actress turned showstopper for one of the shows at the ongoing fashion extravaganza in Mumbai. The dimpled actress walked the ramp for Assam-based designer Sanjukta Dutta. The ‘Kal Ho Naa Ho’ actress channeled her desi side as she strutted down the ramp in a black-coloured Mekhela chadar saree, with red, orange and golden accents. Sporting sideswept hair, Preity completed the look with statement earrings, a bindi and of course, that million dollar smile. If you know Preity, you probably know that she is one actress who always shares her joy with her fans. Soon after her showstopper act, she posted a video from her green room, in which she was joking about how she was relieved that her stint on the runway went without any glitches. Preity even thanked her fans for their support on the big night.
