While the actor is known to work up a crackling chemistry with Alia on-screen, it is his off-screen romance with designer Natasha Dalal that has caught everyone’s fancy. The actor who has frequently dodged questions pertaining to love-life opened up like never before in an interview with Filmfare. Talking about his long-standing hush-hush relationship, Varun says, “I am cool about it. In fact, I've always been cool about it. There's nothing to hide. I just don't want the focus to shift from my career to the relationship. That's why I don't talk much about it.\" \"What can one say about spending time with loved ones? I'm not denying anything at all, just that I don't like to discuss it,\" he added. While he was at it, the star who will be seen playing a small town love-struck man named Badri, went on to even say that he gives Natasha credit for ‘sticking by him’ in the course of their relationship. He says, “I see it (relationship) reaching a good place. She's quite a handful, so full credit to her for sticking by me. She's one of the best people I've come across in my life.” All Comments ()", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:08:00.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
