On its descent, the single-engine Aviat Husky passed over the American Airlines Boeing 737 which was waiting just short of the runway. \nNo one was hurt in the incident, of which the National Transportation Safety Board says it is still gathering information. \nFord, 74, a licensed private pilot, was previously hurt in a 2015 accident when the World War II-era plane he was flying crashed on a golf course near Santa Monica, California. In that incident, Ford reported engine trouble just after takeoff, according to an NTSB investigator, and then allegedly came up short of the runway. \nABC News' Alex Stone and Julie Sone contributed to this report. \n  \nVideo shows Harrison Ford flying over plane before missed landing  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:42:42.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
