Emotion UI 5.1 builds upon the success of its predecessor, as Emotion UI 5.0 brought a number of Android Nougat features to Huawei’s smartphones, and the company is looking to improve upon that by further polishing their UI and adding some new features on top of it. That being said, let’s see what’s new, shall we. \nFirst and foremost, it is worth noting that Emotion UI 5.1 comes with the machine learning algorithm which learns how users use their devices, and can anticipate app usage based on that. Using that info, it is able to allocate and recycle system resources in order to offer you better user experience overall. Now, this feature works in conjunction with Huawei Ultra Memory, which is yet another intelligent feature by the company. First, the machine learning algorithm learns how you use a device, and then, Huawei Ultra Memory can anticipate app usage and manages RAM, once again, to give you the best possible experience using a device. Emotion UI 5.1 also improves touch response, enhances the smoothness of the user experience, and so on. \nNow, all of what we’ve mentioned above should result in faster launching of apps as well, according to Huawei, app launching should be around 30% faster. Predictive finger tracking is also included in this update, and it can anticipate where your finger will move next on the display in order to lower latency response between your finger and the display. Huawei has also added ‘Highlights’, which is a new feature which lies under the Discover tab in the photo gallery. This feature / algorithm essentially recognizes places, events… in order to create albums and organize them. So, this is a photo organizing feature of sorts, and it’s allegedly really smart as well. So, as you can see, on top of Google’s Android Nougat features Huawei added in Emotion UI 5.0 in order to improve user experience and productivity, the company is now taking things one step further with Emotion UI 5.1. Emotion UI is becoming a truly interesting Android skin, that’s for sure. Needless to say, both the Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus will ship with Emotion UI 5.1 on top of Android 7.0 Nougat.
