A PM staffer was suspended after she posted an image of a ‘Tuck Frump’ T-shirt. Picture: Tuck Frump Facebook page Source: Facebook \n“The chief of staff suspended the employee immediately while the matter is investigated further.” \nThe suspension comes as Mr Turnbull continues to hose down rumours relations   US are strained following a disastrous phone call with US President Donald Trump. \nThe PM’s chief of staff is Drew Clarke, who was also the former head of the communications department prior to Mr Turnbull rolling Tony Abbott before the last election. \nThe Prime Minister’s office would not say whether Ms Kerr had been suspended with pay. \nThe suspension was revealed by Ben Fordham on Sydney radio station 2GB this afternoon, who said the post was published on November 4 last year, four days before the US presidential elections. \n“A staff member in PM’s office has been suspended short time ago after posting inappropriate Facebook messages about the US president,” Mr Fordham said. \n“She posted photo of a T-shirt ‘Tuck Frump’, and tuckfrump.com. It is a play on words. If you go to the Facebook tuckfrump.com you will see a video, it promotes a voodoo Donald doll. \n“You would think that because she is working in the PM’s office she would be wiser than to do something like this. The offensive post about Trump has remained on her Facebook page until today. \n“We know his relationship with Trump is already on shaky ground and he can’t really afford to mark things worse. This is probably not the smartest career move she has ever made.” \nTuckFrump.com is a social media protest campaign headed by Luke Montgomery, who took up the fight against Trump in November 2015 over racist comments made by the then Republican candidate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:59:14.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
