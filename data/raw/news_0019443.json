Requiring the removal of two old regulations before a new one is imposed goes beyond his constitutional authority, opponents allege. \nTrump’s “ one-in, two-out ” executive order over regulations received pushback from unions and left-leaning advocacy groups. Trump claimed that the order was not directed specifically at regulations from the Obama administration but rather “ a knock on many presidents preceding me. ” \nWhile the 178,000 pages of rules in the Code of Federal Regulations likely contains some redundancies, outdated policies or unnecessary policies, there is concern about Trump’s promise to repeal 75 percent of all federal regulations.

He told The Hill, \" If implemented, the order would result in lasting damage to our government's ability to save lives, protect our environment, police Wall Street, keep consumers safe and fight discrimination. ” \nThe White House has rebuked these claims. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the lawsuit “ makes a ton of assumptions that call for speculation on what may or may not happen in the future and that’s highly — it’s just subjective at best, and it doesn’t have any basis in fact. ”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T11:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:43:36.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
