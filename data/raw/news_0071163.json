A lot has changed since his coaching journey began, and with the cost of playing the game getting more expensive for families over the years, he saw a need to help.\n'He's a very generous person' \"I find parents today have to work hard, keep up the living with our economy and everything,\" he said, \"It's more expensive, and they have to find the extra help if they need it, and that's what I sort of do.\"\nCarol Easy calls her husband Bob a 'very generous person.' (CBC)\nHis fundraising efforts include asking local companies for donations, bottle drives, and selling chocolate bars. He's become the go-to guy for bottle donations in Munster, where he and his wife Carol live.\n\"It doesn't matter what little town we go to, someone stops and says hello,\" said Carol. She adds the recognition doesn't go to his head â€” he always puts the players and their families first.\n\"He doesn't talk a lot about what he does behind the scenes. He's a very generous person and most giving of his time, and it doesn't matter what you ask him to do, he'll be there and do it.\nBob maintains the coaching and fundraising are things he enjoys doing, and he hopes others will give it a try.\n\"I'm hoping other coaches do the same thing and make sure the boys and girls can enjoy whatever sports they're playing,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:46:29.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
