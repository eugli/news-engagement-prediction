Buddhism has Precepts, but it's important to understand that the Buddhist Precepts are not a list of rules to follow. \nIn some religions, moral laws are believed to have come from God, and breaking those laws is a sin or transgression against God. But Buddhism doesn't have a God, and the Precepts are not commandments. However, that doesn't exactly mean they're optional, either. \nThe Pali word most often translated as \"morality\" is sila , but sila has many connotations that go beyond the English word \"morality.\" It can refer to inner virtue such as kindness and truthfulness as well as the activity of those virtues in the world. It can also refer to the discipline of acting in a moral way . However, sila is best understood as a kind of harmony. Being in Harmony \nThe Theravadin teacher Bikkhu Bodhi wrote, \n\"The Buddhist texts explain that sila has the characteristic of harmonizing our actions of body and speech. Sila harmonizes our actions by bringing them into accord with our own true interests, with the well-being of others, and with universal laws. Actions contrary to sila lead to a state of self-division marked by guilt, anxiety, and remorse. But the observance of the principles of sila heals this division, bringing our inner faculties together into a balanced and centered state of unity.\" (\" Going for Refuge and Taking the Precepts \") \nIt is said that the Precepts describe the way an enlightened being naturally lives. At the same time, the discipline of upholding the Precepts is part of the path to enlightenment. As we begin to work with the Precepts we find ourselves \"breaking\" or defiling them over and over. We can think of this as something like falling off a bicycle, and we can either beat ourselves up about falling -- which is disharmonious -- or we can get back on the bicycle and start pedaling again. \nThe Zen teacher Chozen Bays said, \"We just keep on working, we are patient with ourselves, and on and on it goes. Little by little our life comes more into alignment with the wisdom that gives rise to the precepts. As our minds get clearer and clearer, it's not even a matter of breaking or maintaining the precepts; automatically they are maintained.\" The Five Precepts \nBuddhists don't have just one set of Precepts. Depending on which list you consult, you might hear there are three, five, ten, or sixteen Precepts. Monastic orders have longer lists. \nThe most basic list of Precepts is called in Pali the pa√±casila , or \"five precepts.\" In Theravada Buddhism , these Five Precepts are the basic precepts for lay Buddhists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:21:28.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
