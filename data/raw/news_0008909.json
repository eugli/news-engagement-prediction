Is this anyone else? \n— Josh Gondelman (@joshgondelman) February 3, 2017 \nHis solution? To donate money to causes he thinks are worthy when the Patriots score: Because of Tom Brady's garbage politics, I'm donating $100 for every Patriots TD and $50 for every FG to the @NAACP_LDF . #AGoodGame \n— Josh Gondelman (@joshgondelman) February 3, 2017 \nIt looks like #AGoodGame has caught on: As somebody without a rooting interest, I’m going to donate $30 for every non-scoring drive to @NILC_org . #AGoodGame \n— Bill Barnwell (@billbarnwell) February 4, 2017 Donating $5 for @Patriots field goals and $10 for @Patriots touchdowns to a woman campaigning for office. Thanks @joshgondelman ! #AGoodGame \n— Tanya Lundberg (@ILAH17_GoBlue) February 4, 2017 I am a lifelong Patriots fan. I feel morally compromised – always have. Will donate $10/TD and $5/FG to @DesisRisingUp . #AGoodGame \n— Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio) February 4, 2017 \nGondelman did clarify his statements about Brady’s politics later. Via Boston Magazine : \nHe also notes, by the way, that calling Tom Brady’s politics “garbage” might have been “hyperbolic.” \nHe clarified: “What I mean, in the cold harsh light of day, is that I wish he would engage more critically with politics given his well-documented terrible choice in red hats.” More!
