The singer who recently released his mixtape – “Life Is Eazi, Volume 1 – Accra to Lagos” – is connected with the US rapper and his team in Toronto Canada. Eazi has a partnership with Wizkid, who was featured on the Drake’s “Views” album, and got a Grammy nomination as a result. Now he is linking up directly with Drake and members of his team. Eazi’s new mixtape contains a collaboration with Toronto-based artiste, Big Lean , and in a recent interview with Complex, Eazi reveals that he is working on music with people in Drake’s OVO camp. “For instance Big Lean is affiliated with OVO. So some days ago I met the OVO team. I met I think 1980 or 1950, I don’t know. I can’t remember his name.” Eazi told Complex. \nMr Eazi is a unique artiste, a Nigerian singer who first got recognition in Ghana. (Instagram/mreazi ) Mr Eazi is talking about Nineteen85 , the co-producer of Drake’s phenomenal single ‘One dance’, which spent 10 weeks at the top of the Billboard 100 chart, and recorded over a billion streams on Spotify. He is not the only one. Eazi also has more up his sleeve. “I've recorded two songs with Di Genius , who produced \"Controlla.\" And I’ve been working with the man who produced Mixpak. (Dre Skull)” Eazi said. And how about the boss of them all, Drake? Eazi has met him too. According to the singer, the US superstar recognized him, and introduced him to Young Thug . “The OVO come the other day, and someone was introducing me to Majid Jordan. I met Drake some days ago in London. He already knew the music. He already knew who I was. “It was just the first time we meet. He said, “Oh I love your music.” He introduced me to Young Thug. It was more of a meeting—“Hi, what’s up?—cause he was at an afterparty. It’s just on those levels.” Mr Eazi plans to work with Drake and other members of the OVO team. He is in meeting with them, and working with their producers for his next project. \nMr Eazi receiving Best New Artist award at the Soundcity MVP Awards 2016 (Pulse) “You know I definitely fuck with the OVO team. Since I’m all about fusion, Drake is one of the persons at the forefront of that. When he does fusion, when he does Banku music, he does it best. “And not just in the music, but even in the numbers and in the pop charts. So it’s something I look forward to doing some time in the future. But the focus now is Accra to Lagos and basically cementing my position in West Africa.” Pulse reviewed Mr Eazi’s “Life Is Eazi, Volume 1 – Accra to Lagos” mixtape, and scored it 3.5/5. The review summary reads: ‘At the end of the tape, is a lingering satisfying feeling that comes from being engaged from start to finish. “Life Is Eazi, Volume 1 – Accra to Lagos” is far from perfect, but it bangs, and marks time as the project that signifies the rise of a new power in Africa.’ \nLeg Over (Vibez Video) ft Wizkid , Eddie Kadi & Maleek Berry Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:58:59.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
