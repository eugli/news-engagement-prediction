Thor Jensen 02.02.2017 :: 10:00AM EST kthorjensen \nThe Internet is where we do most of our shopping, and a solid 90% of it is done at Amazon. Jeff Bezos has turned his humble bookstore into a sort of Automat of the digital age, selling everything from soup to nuts at low prices with speedy shipping. Nobody knows Amazon deals quite like we do. Except for you, that is. Welcome to Prime Directive, where we find the coolest things on Amazon.com and feed them to you, one at a time. 2/2/2017 Onyx Smart Walkie Talkies \nIf you grew up in the pre cell phone generation, you probably have fond memories of talking to your friends late at night through a pair of staticky Radio Shack walkie-talkies. Before we were constantly connected via the Internet, short-range radio was the best way to transmit secrets, share gossip and plan pranks. One of the coolest new tech products we’ve seen recently re-invents the walkie into something seriously futuristic and cool. \nThe Onyx Smart Walkie Talkies from Orion Labs are a pair of button-sized, touch-activated devices that pair with your smartphone and a free app. Hook them up, invite friends and you can activate it with a single touch and broadcast to as many people as you want. The only caveat is your phone has to have data either through cell network or Wi-Fi, but when doesn’t that happen? We’re already thinking of dozens of cool ways we could use this thing. \n$199.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 2/1/2017 The 100 Season 3 \nIt’s kind of crazy how The CW, a network previously best known for heated teen drama and lousy comedy, has turned into one of the best geek destinations on the TV dial. Their DC Comics shows cover a variety of space from the gritty Arrow to the endearingly kitschy Legends Of Tomorrow , but the real jewel in their crown is The 100 , a post-apocalyptic sci-fi show that’s about a million times better than it has any right to be. \nWhen the Earth is ravaged by nuclear warfare, the only survivors are onboard a floating space station. Nearly a century later, resources are running thin, so they send 100 kids to the surface on a suicide mission to see if the planet is survivable. It is, but things don’t get any better from there. After this point is spoilers, but you can get caught up when Season 4 premieres tonight. Here’s the last season on Blu-Ray. Buy it. \n$34.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/31/2017 Absolute All-Star Superman \nHappy 57th birthday to Grant Morrison, the chrome-domed Scottish chaos magician slash comic book artist who came up in the early days of Vertigo to turn into one of the industry’s most invigorating writers. Grant’s handled just about every big franchise in his career, from Batman to the X-Men, as well as creating a whole pile of original concepts. But if we had to pick one book from his massive library to really sell his skills, it would be All-Star Superman . \nWorking with frequent collaborator Frank Quitely, Morrison threw out half a century of continuity and cruft to pare the Man of Steel down to his essential elements, then explored them with heart. This is truly a Superman story for the ages, as over the course of twelve issues he deals with love, loss and his own mortality. It’s legit one of the best DC comics ever published, and this gorgeous oversized hardcover is the optimal way to enjoy it. \n$75.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/30/2017 Particle Photon Wi-Fi Kit \nThe Internet is all around us, connecting disparate elements of our lives with ease. If you’re anything like the Geek staff, you’ve got an Amazon Echo or a Google Home talking to smart light bubs, thermostats and other Internet of Things devices all over your apartment. But it’s time to take things to the next level and start hacking your own dumb devices to make them smart. The first thing you’ll need is a Particle Photon Wi-Fi Kit. \nThis affordable unit lets you add Ardunio-powered Wi-Fi functionality to pretty much anything you want, allowing you to easily and quickly control hardware through the Internet. From garage door openers to coffemakers to sex toys, if you can blueprint it you can use this puppy to run it. It even comes with free access to their cloud server so you don’t have to set up your own. And at just $19 it’s a hell of a deal. \n$19.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/27/2017 Resident Evil 7 \nTypically we use this space to highlight forgotten treasures and secret deals from deep in the bowels of Amazon’s massive warehouse, but you know what? We’re not doing anything but playing Resident Evil 7 and if you’re not, you need to be. Capcom’s flagship survival horror series has gone through some serious ups and downs since debuting in 1996. We’ve seen all-time classics and some very weird missteps. \nRE7 returns the series to form while simultaneously pushing it forward. Like the very first game, the story takes place in a massive, crumbling house. Unlike the first, the action is now in first person, making the tension even harder to handle. And, for the first time, you can play it in VR. Play it in VR. It’ll scare the living hell right out of you. Early GOTY candidate right here, and it’s not even February. \n$57.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/26/2017 Archie Vol. 1 \nIt’s getting so you can’t throw a brick these days without hitting a comic book adaptation on TV. Every network seems to have at least one show based on graphic literature, with the CW leading the pack with their interconnected DC universe. The latest offering, though, takes inspiration from a very different long-running comics universe. We’re talking about Riverdale , which morphs the world of Archie Andrews into a modern teen drama with all the angst that entails. \nIf your only memory of Archies is the corny little reprints you see at the grocery store, you haven’t been paying attention. The venerable publisher did a line-wide update a few years ago, bringing in top-flight talent like Mark Waid and Saga ‘s Fiona Staples to bring the titular character into the present day. The results have been great all around (with Chip Zdarsky’s Jughead book a special standout). Catch up on Archie’s pals and gals with this collection of the series’ first arc. \n$12.18 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/25/2017 PocketLab \nIt hasn’t been the best few days for science. The new guy in the Oval Office seems pretty determined to ignore anything that doesn’t directly bolster his existing worldview, and he’s instructed many of the government’s agencies to stop talking about stuff like climate change. But the pursuit of knowledge will persist no matter what, and the best thing you can do is become a “citizen scientist” of your own. \nTo wit, we’d like to introduce the Myriad PocketLab, a multi-sensor that works with any mobile device to measure a wide variety of physical forces, from motion and rotation to magnetism, pressure, temperature and more. All of that juicy data is fed into their app, where you can graph it, compare it, and upload it to share with the world. This kind of work is going to be pretty important in the years to come, so get on board now and let’s make some science. \n$86.41 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/24/2017 HORI Real Arcade Pro Kai \nThe evolution of console video game controllers has come a long way, from the Atari 2600’s joystick and single button, through the NES’s revolutionary D-pad, and on to modern devices with multiple analog sticks, shoulder buttons, touch pads and other assorted functionality. These controllers are damn good at playing most kinds of games, but for some genres you really have to go back to basics. If you play a lot of fighting games, old-school shooters or arcade classics, you need a stick. \nThe RAP Kai has HORI’s high-quality Hayabusa joystick and buttons, letting you hit your dragon punch inputs with arcade-perfect precision. It’s a very reasonably priced stick that works with PS3, PS4 and PCs. It’s also got a pile of extra functionality, including a touchpad, configurable buttons, turbo and more. If your home system doesn’t have one, this is an incredibly good deal. \n$149.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/23/2017 Secret Wars II \nIf you’re looking for the inflection point where the Marvel Universe transformed from a relatable world full of believable, if exaggerated characters into a constantly-escalating crossover hell, look no further. Secret Wars II was a line-wide crossover that spanned 1985 and 1986, touching every single corner of the Marvel universe in a bad way. When the omnipotent alien Beyonder comes to Earth, he basically just does a bunch of completely insane stuff for no reason. \nOver the course of these nine issues and fifty million tie-ins, he turns a skyscraper into gold, kills and revives the New Mutants, falls in love with the Dazzler, and is taught how to go to the bathroom by Spider-Man. If you haven’t read it, it’s a gloriously weird slice of 80s cheese that some of Marvel’s biggest writers have been mining for ideas for the last two decades. \n$16.92 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/20/2017 The Twilight Zone: The Complete Series \nMany Americans are waking up this morning feeling like they’ve stepped through a door “beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man’s fears and the summit of his knowledge.” That’s the door to the Twilight Zone. \nNow’s a better time than ever to re-watch Rod Serling’s five-season masterwork that introduced speculative fiction to a new generation of Americans. In 156 episodes, The Twilight Zone tackled a bevy of subjects with help from some of the era’s best TV actors. This sweet-ass Blu-Ray box set presents them all in pristine quality with a pile of bonus features. \n$71.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/19/2017 Apocalypse Shovel \nYou’re not alone if you’re thinking that things are seeming decidedly end-of-the-worldish right now. Russia is meddling in our government, the polar ice cap is cracking, Will & Grace is returning to TV. The signs are all there, and if you want to ride out the last days of humanity in relative comfort you need to gear up. I assume you’re already good on guns and food, so let’s talk tools. \nThe Apocalypse Shovel from master knifemaker Mykel Hawke is a lightweight survival tool that’s good for more than just digging holes. Within the knurled steel handle hides a variety of useful items, including a glass breaker, a bow drill for starting fires, a fixed blade knife and more. The shovel also features a pick axe for busting through tough soil. Made of hardened stainless steel treated with anti-corrosive finish, this baby will also slice through a zombie’s skull with ease. \n$78.09 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/18/2017 Battle Royale: Director’s Cut \nHappy 70th birthday to Takeshi Kitano, the Japanese actor / director / game show host who has made his presence felt in just about every sphere of geek culture. From hosting Takeshi’s Castle , the wild obstacle course that would inspire dozens of imitators, to consulting on the NES game Takeshi’s Challenge , widely regarded as one of the most absurd and difficult pieces of software ever released, to directing and starring in lyrical, violent yakuza movies, Kitano has done it all. \nAmerican audiences first met him as the teacher in Battle Royale , Kinji Fukasaku’s bleak survival horror flick about a class of students forced to battle to the death on a remote island for their country’s televised entertainment. It was a remarkably prescient and brutal film, and Kitano’s laid-back authority figure provides an awesome dramatic fulcrum. If you haven’t seen it, get cracking. \n$9.49 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/17/2017 Moon Girl & Devil Dinosaur \nWe could probably fill an entire calendar just with characters created by the great Jack Kirby. The most prolific mind in comics history erupted ideas like a volcano, and most of them were keepers. January 17, 1978 saw the introduction of one of his most unusual creations – a cherry red Tyrannosaurus Rex dubbed Devil Dinosaur. In the pages of his own series, Devil and his hirsute primate partner Moon Boy tackled all sorts of prehistoric problems for nine issues before being cancelled. \nDevil Dinosaur turned up again last year in the pages of Amy Reeder and Brandon Montclaire’s brilliant new series Moon Girl & Devil Dinosaur , paired up with nine year old Lunella Layfayette, the smartest person in the Marvel universe. This TPB of their first adventures is a cracking read, updating a sort of silly character for the modern world in a wonderful way. \n$11.61 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/16/2017 March \nWe’re taking most of the day off here, for obvious reasons, but given the events that took place over the weekend we wanted to share an Amazon deal that’s socially relevant. Not only is Georgia congressman John Lewis a true hero of the civil rights era, he’s also the only elected official in Washington to ever write a graphic novel. March tells the story of Lewis’s struggle, with kinetic, powerful art by Nate Powell. \nDon’t take our word for it, though. March is the winner of a National Book Award, an Eisner award, it’s the first graphic novel to receive a Robert F. Kennedy Book Award… the list goes on. It’s an incredible accomplishment from a life full of them. We’re going to send a copy to Trump Tower. Maybe Barron will read it. \n$29.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/13/2017 Anki Overdrive Starter Kit \nYes, we’re all still reeling from the Nintendo Switch reveal, but let’s be realistic here: you’re going to need something to do until March, so the deals, like the spice, must flow. And today we’ve got a really hot bargain on one of the coolest evolutions of the RC car in some time. Anki Overdrive not only lets you control your vehicle with your mobile phone, it also features enemy cars with sophisticated AI routines, weaponry, variable tracks and more. It’s like playing F-Zero in meatspace. \nIf you dig it, the company offers a wide selection of track pieces, new cars and more fun and funky stuff. But you’ll get days of enjoyment out of just the basics. If you have nostalgic memories of slot car tracks in your weird bachelor uncle’s basement, this is the 21st century version, and it’s a sweet ass ride. \n$119.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/12/2017 Rob Zombie Box Set \n2016 brought a lot of bummers, but at least Rob Zombie put out an album called “The Electric Warlock Acid Witch Satanic Orgy Celebration Dispenser,” so things weren’t all bad. Today is the 52nd birthday of the man born Robert Bartleh Cummings, who took shock-rock sensibilities to the big screen and revitalized the Halloween franchise. Sure, Zombie’s work isn’t for everyone, but we have to respect a self-professed geek who goes this deep into the culture. \nIt was hard to pick a single element of Zombie’s life to spotlight – did you know he was a production assistant on Pee-Wee’s Playhouse ? – but when we spotted this bargain-priced box set of House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil’s Rejects we knew we’d hit it. House was Zombie’s directorial debut, introducing us to the degenerate Firefly family, and it’s fine to have both of these movies (plus a sweet making-of documentary) in one place. \n$13.57 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/11/2017 A Series Of Unfortunate Events: The Complete Wreck \nNetflix is going buckwild with the Original Series lately, seemingly dropping a new show every week. But one we’re really amped for is A Series Of Unfortunate Events , based on the book series by pseudonymous author Lemony Snicket. If all you know of this is the awful Jim Carrey movie, you’re in for a treat. The books are cracking adventure stories featuring the three Baudelaire orphans eluding the wiles of the malevolent Count Olaf, crammed with wit and surprising darkness. \nTypically we’d offer you a great deal on the first volume and trust you’d be hooked from there, but you know what? Why waste time. The Netflix series premieres this weekend, and you want to be ahead of the curve. Here’s a gorgeous hardcover set of all 13 books for an insanely low price. Clear some shelf space, dummy. \n$111.45 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/10/2017 SubPac M2 Wearable Physical Sound System \nVideo gaming now is all about the immersion. We’re strapping VR headsets to our faces and diving into the most realistic worlds ever built. But those only really satisfy one of our five senses. We’re not asking to smell the stables in Skyrim or anything, but hardware could certainly do better. One of the sweetest ways to beef up your audio footprint comes in the form of the SubPac M2 Wearable Physical Sound System, which takes your crappy desktop speakers and replaces them with a vest that channels audio right through your body. \nDesigned by a startup, this device either connects by Bluetooth or aux cord to your audio system and creates bass vibrations that you can feel through your whole body. That means that grenade explosions rattle your bones and gunshots give you real recoil. Play with one of these once and you’ll never want to game without it. \n$349.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/9/2017 Tintin In America \nWhat were you doing when you were 14 years old? Probably playing a lot of video games, drinking a lot of soda, trying to work up the nerve to talk to girls (or boys). But on January 10, 1929, the comics world was introduced to one of the most badass teenagers of all time: Tintin, the globe-trotting boy reporter who would risk everything for a story. Herge’s hero can drive a tank, fly a plane, punch a thug in the jaw and is a crack shot with pistol or rifle, and his adventures still hold up nearly a century later. \nIf by some bizarre anti-miracle you’ve never gotten into Tintin , take advantage of this great deal on the third volume of his adventures, Tintin In America . This was where Herge really started to hit his stride, with a great tale of Tintin on the trail of gangsters in Chicago and Blackfoot in the Wild West. It’s a cracking read that will leave you thirsty for more. \n$9.07 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/6/2017 Eight Pounds Of Cereal Marshmallows \nIt takes a tremendous amount of energy to get us through the day. We’re always running at 110% to bring you the best of geek culture, and that combined with epic Nerf wars, VR deep dives and jeet kune do classes makes us very, very hungry. That’s why we’ve been buying eight pound bags of cereal marshmallows from Amazon and turning to them every time we need a quick boost. \nThe humble cereal marshmallow was invented in the 1960s with the debut of Lucky Charms, and it’s almost hard to believe that they’re the same thing as you use to make s’mores. Cereal marshmallows are made with a process that removes as much water as possible, making them shelf-stable for years. While an eight pound bag might seem like overkill, you’ll be surprised at how fast these babies disappear even without any milk around. \n$41.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/5/2017 Video Games You Will Never Play \nGame development can be a cruel mistress. The effort it takes to steer a title from conception to completion is massive and only getting bigger. That’s why it shouldn’t surprise you that, like baby turtles, many games don’t make it out the door. Some studios shut down, some publishers pull out, and sometimes they just don’t come together. The collective behind Unseen64 has compiled their massive knowledge of cancelled games into Video Games You Will Never Play , an exhaustive compendium of these poor vidcons. \nThis beefy 480 page full color paperback contains a wealth of information on cancelled, failed, and otherwise unreleased games from the early PC days to modern consoles. Exclusive interviews, screenshots and information that you won’t find anywhere else is crammed into every page of this amazingly dense, exhaustive resource. \n$64.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/4/2017 Princess Mononoke: The First Story \nTomorrow is the birthday of probably the greatest and most influential anime director of all time, Studio Ghibli’s Hayao Miyazaki. To celebrate, his masterpiece Princess Mononoke (itself celebrating its 20th birthday this year) is returning to theaters for a quick run. We strongly encourage you to catch it on the big screen to really take in the incredible mastery at play, but since we can’t sell you a movie theater here we’re bringing you something equally cool. \nBefore he got into anime, Miyazaki was a cartoonist, and the pages of Princess Mononoke: The First Story were created in 1980 while he was first conceptualizing the story. Lush watercolor illustrations tell a very different story than the movie does, about a samurai encountering a massive magical forest cat (shades of Totoro here). It’s a very cool peek into the creative process of an anime legend. \n$31.15 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/3/2017 Avatar: The Last Airbender: The Complete Series \nWe’ve got plenty of bones to pick with Nickelodeon, who have pumped out a geyser of absolute crap programming in the last few decades. But they still manage to land in our good graces for airing Avatar: The Last Airbender , probably the best action-adventure cartoon of this generation. This show was a strong throwback to classic 80s adventures like Thundarr the Barbarian but with a strong anime influence, and if you’ve never seen it there’s no time like the present. \nWhat made Avatar so great? For one, it was dedicated to its characters and gave them room to breathe and grow over the course of three seasons. The martial arts sequences are also well-researched and true to life. It won a damn Emmy Award, for God’s sake. Don’t go in thinking that Avatar is just for kids or weeaboos. It’s solidly one of the best shows of the 2000s. Please just forget the M. Night Shyamalan film version, though. That thing was a Goddamned mess. \n$28.20 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 1/2/2017 Iron Monkey \nWe’re starting a new year here at Prime Directive and our resolution is to keep things insanely positive, sharing something we absolutely love from Amazon every single day and even giving you a little bit of background story to go with it. Let’s do it! \nAfter watching Rogue One for the third time, the one question we had was “why isn’t Donnie Yen a bigger star over here?” He’s one of the most legit martial artists to ever work in the HK film industry, and his dynamic personality and solid English skills seem tailor-made for crossover success. He’s set to play the villain in the upcoming XXX sequel, but if you really want to see what he can do, check out 1993’s brilliant Iron Monkey \nBest described as a Chinese take on Batman , the flick tells the tale of a masked figure fighting against a corrupt governor. Yen plays the traveling martial artist blackmailed into taking him down, and then we’re off to the fireworks factory with some of the hottest fight scenes ever lensed. This one’s an underrated classic that you need to see. \n$24.95 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/30/2016 Desktop Tesla Coil Kit \nIt was pretty hard to settle on the last Amazon deal we’d bring you in 2016. This has been a year unlike any we can remember, filled with triumphs and tragedies, and summing it all up in a single product was a daunting task. Do we pay tribute to those we lost, or look towards the future? Do we go for entertainment or education? At the end of the day, only one choice was clear: do it all. \nThe Tesla coil is one of the most iconic symbols of geekdom, celebrating a scientist who was unpopular in his own time but history has proven to be a genius. And this do-it-yourself Tesla coil kit also celebrates one of the most important facets of the geek identity: we’re hands-on. We build what we love. End the year by firing up this 220v arc of electricity at your desk and send some charge off into the ether for an electrifying New Year. \n$149.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/29/2016 Star Trek: Ascendancy \nWe’re doing board games in December, and we’re also doing Star Trek for some reason, so let’s close this out by combining two great things into one. One of our favorite tabletop experiences in 2016 was Star Trek: Ascendancy , a massive game of exploration, expansion and conflict that lets you play the Federation, the Klingons or the Romulans. Each game is different because the layout of planets and space routes is modular, giving it tons of replayability. \nIf you’re a fan of classic computer 4x strategy like Master Of Orion , this is going to scratch that itch perfectly. It’s quite possibly the most complex and deep Star Trek board game ever produced. Amazon has Ascendancy for an insane 30% off, so what are you waiting for? \n$69.62 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/28/2016 Amazing Fantastic Incredible: A Marvelous Memoir \n94 years ago today, the earth rumbled, the heavens quaked, a geyser of cosmic energy erupted from the sun and a baby named Stanley Martin Lieber entered the world. You wouldn’t know it from looking at him, but that baby would go on to become one of the most influential figures in geek culture of all time. Stan Lee, as the child would be known, is obviously the co-creator of the majority of the Marvel universe, and his slick patter and down-to-earth concerns transformed superheroes in the 60s like never before. \nLast year Lee released his memoir, Amazing Fantastic Incredible , and it’s exactly what you would expect from the legendary self-promoter: a breathless recounting of his words and deeds that is illustrated by the great Colleen Doran. There are dozens of weird, funny tales from the early days of Marvel here, and it’s a must-buy for any comics buff. Excelsior! \n$20.40 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/27/2016 Star Trek: The Complete Original Series \nThe TV debut we’re looking forward to most in 2017 is probably Star Trek: Discovery , the first new Trek series in a decade, over 50 years after the original first set off on its mission. As you’d guess from the title, Discovery is all about exploring strange new worlds, seeking out new life and new civilizations, and boldly going where no man has gone before. \nBrush up on your Trek lore with this insanely cheap Blu-Ray box set of the original series, which lays the foundation for the Federation, the Klingons, the Romulans, and thousands of other pieces of Star Trek world-building that will be important come January when Discovery hits the airwaves. \n$64.22 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/26/2016 ODiN Aurora Projection Mouse \nAnd with the sun rising this Monday, Christmas season is over. We hope you got absolutely everything you wanted, because we’re about to show you things you never knew you could live without. Commerce never sleeps, people, and neither do we. Are you getting pissed of by the relative low-techness of your mouse or touchpad? Step into the future with us and the ODiN Aurora Projection Mouse. \nPlug this puppy (which looks a lot like a Transformer head) in and it’ll use lasers to “draw” a trackpad on any surface, and then use any pointing device, finger included, to interact with it. It’s remarkably user-friendly once you get the hang of it and, by encouraging flat hand positioning, can help prevent the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome. Plus it’s a dang robot head that shoots lasers at your desk, what more do you want? \n$69.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/23/2016 Scythe \nWe’ve been spending the month of December spotlighting some of the best board games you can find on Amazon, and right before Christmas we want to share with you one of the best we played all year. Scythe is a brilliant, wildly replayable strategy game from Stonemaier Games. Set in an alternate history 1920s where players take control of factions seeking to rebuild and conquer a devastated Europe. The game design is fantastic, with an emphasis on building “engines” to give you granular control over your strategy. \nIt’s a wildly fun game with great production values, but it’s not for the strategically inept – you need to be able to think several steps ahead to play at a high level, and there are so many different paths to victory that mastering a couple of them is a necessity. This one’s very deserving of a place in your collection. \n104.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/22/2016 Black Christmas \nEvery family has its own Christmas movie tradition. Some watch A Christmas Story , some watch Die Hard , but around our way we swear by the sleazy 1974 slasher flick Black Christmas , about a sorority house being terrorized by a homicidal maniac in their attic. It’s a tense and grimy experience in the way that the 70s did so well, and features Margot Kidder in one of her early breakthrough roles. \nOrder it today and you can have this beautiful Blu-Ray transfer at your door before Christmas Eve. Join us in this bloodiest of traditions, won’t you? \n$29.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/21/2016 Captain America Omnibus \nIt’s been a tough few months for the American Dream. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are all under threat by enemies both foreign and domestic, and even the core systems of our government are being torn down around us. So for today’s deal, we look back to December 21, 1940, when the first issue of Captain America Comics hit the stands by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. Marvel’s flag-emblazoned hero has always stood for the best in us (well, except for right now when he’s a covert HYDRA agent, but that’ll get cleared up soonish), and delving back into his history can remind us what we should hold dear. \nThis massive hardcover collection boasts a whopping 856 full-color pages of peak Cap adventure by Stan Lee, Roy Thomas, Jack Kirby, Jim Steranko and more. It’s peak Marvel muscle, full of dynamic storytelling and way-out villains. \n$125.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/20/2016 Airzooka \nIf your office is anything like Geek headquarters, you’re in a constant non-lethal annoyance battle against your cubicle mates using whatever you can get your hands on. But the real problem with Nerf guns and the like is that a wise foe will confiscate your ammunition after you fire it, depleting your ability to strike from a distance. How to solve this issue? How about with a desk weapon that strikes with the air itself? \nThe Airzooka is a brilliant creation that blasts a “ball” of pressurized air as far as 50 feet, causing deep, potent annoyance but no permanent damage. Aim it at a stack of important TPS reports if you really want to be a dick, but it’s best used to tap the back of a co-worker’s head from across the room. It even has pop-up sights so you can line up that perfect shot. Make 2017 a year of advanced office warfare by using the elements themselves like some sort of prankster warlock. \n$22.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/19/2016 Rick & Morty Season 1 \nWhat was the most mindf*cking show on TV in 2016? Was it Westworld ‘s tricky dance between robots and humans, the future and the past? Was it Black Mirror jumping back into the dark heart of technology? Trick question, dumbass. It was Rick & Morty , and it will always be Rick & Morty . Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland’s animated take on the Back to the Future partnership blew out of the gate with a second season that steadily built on itself to deliver both insane laughs and serious brain-melting. \nWhile we wait for the third season to drop, why not reacquaint yourself with how it all started, or spread the love to somebody who hasn’t hopped on board? Twenty five bucks for the whole first season on crystal-clear Blu-Ray is an insanely good deal. Snap it up, sucker. \n$24.96 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/16/2016 One Punch Man Volume 1 \nIf there’s one fictional character that came to define 2016 for us, it’s Saitama, the titular protagonist of cult hit manga One Punch Man . In a world clogged to the gills with superheroes, each one boasting a magnificent (or sometimes idiotic) power, he’s just an ordinary guy who did 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats and ran 10 kilometers a day until he was the strongest being on Earth. Saitama’s capable of knocking out any foe with just one blow, but the series is about his existential boredom with the hero business. \nMany, many volumes are available in English but you gotta jump on this one right at the beginning. The art is top-notch, with the contrast between Saitama’s goofy, plain appearance and the intense monsters drawn by Yusuke Murata a high point. This manga is just a pile of fun from start to finish and will make you dedicate yourself even harder to your New Year’s resolution to get in shape. 100 push-ups doesn’t sound that bad right now. \n$8.45 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/15/2016 10x10x10 Speed Cube Puzzle \nYou consider yourself a smart person, right? You must, because you’re reading this site and we don’t dumb it down for the normies. So, like most smart people, you probably enjoyed a period of Rubik’s Cube solving in your past. The Cube is a fascinating test of someone’s mental ability, as there are multiple tiers of mastery. First you get a handle on the essential mechanics of it, solving through brute force and experimentation. Then you master the underlying mathematics like Neo in The Matrix to optimize your movements. And finally, you graduate to “speed cubing,” restoring the sides in as short a time as possible. \nYou’ve got that down with a standard Rubik’s Cube. Now it’s time to go big. This patently insane 10x10x10 Speed Cube Puzzle is the Godzilla of color cubes, 100 squares on each side of solving pain. Measuring nearly a foot on each side, this is an engineering marvel that would be just as good as a display object in your house if you eventually give up on finishing it. \n$79.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/14/2016 E-Element 104 PBT Double Shot Injection Backlit Golden Metal Color Keycaps \nWe’re not going to insult your intelligence and pretend you haven’t upgraded to a mechanical keyboard for your battlestation. There’s nothing more satisfying than that old-school clacking sound, and the response time is far superior for gaming. So what’s the next step to really trick that baby out? Gold keycaps, of course. \nNo, these aren’t actual gold – we don’t think you’re playing with Donald Trump money, after all – but they’re blinged out as all hell and they’ll look insanely good on your keyboard. There are a number of different ways you could deploy these puppies. To go seriously luxe, do every key with them. Or for an accent, just replace the arrow keys or WASD. Maybe just the number pad if you’re a hard-core data processor? The possibilities are endless, and at just $25 you’d be nuts not to snap up this deal. \n$24.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/13/2016 Funko Pop Wolfman \nDifferent monsters like different times of the year. The Creature from the Black Lagoon and Jason Voorhees are summer hunters, for instance. But when there’s snow on the ground, that’s the Wolf Man’s time to shine. On December 13, 1941, one of the most influential monster movies in history hit theaters – Curt Siodmak’s The Wolf Man , starring Lon Chaney Jr. as the titular lycanthrope. Chaney’s take on the hairy killer, ably aided by makeup artist Jack Pierce, defined the beast going forward. \nPay tribute to Chaney with this sweet-ass Universal Monsters Funko Pop, taking the actor’s befurred visage and cutesifying it into a desk decoration with a bobbling head that thirsts for blood. While we’re not the biggest Funko Pops fan, there’s no denying that this one is pretty awesome. \n$16.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/12/2016 Camp Grizzly \nIt’s cold outside, so you know what that means: bust out the board games. We committed to bringing you hot deals on some of our favorites this month, so let’s throw a little light on a recent release that hits all of our sweet spots. Camp Grizzly , from Ameritrash Games, melds survival horror and semi-cooperative strategy into a game that’s a blast to play. Each player controls a counselor at the titular camp while avoiding Otis, the seemingly unstoppable serial killer. \nThe game’s basic rules are simple, but things get heated with the introduction of Cameos – extra characters that can totally upset your carefully-crafted plans for survival. Otis also gets stronger the more people he kills, so play becomes more and more tense as the game grinds on. It’s a hell of a lot of fun, especially when you’re snowed in and the power goes out. Wait, did you hear a noise from the basement? Don’t worry, I’ll go check alone without a flashlight. I’m sure it’s just a possum. \n$50.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/9/2016 Minimalist Silver Surfer Shirt \nI’m re-reading the classic Stan Lee and Jack Kirby run on Fantastic Four , as you do when you want to see the origin of pretty much every superhero comics trope, and I just got to the epic Galactus saga. The team had faced ultra-powerful aliens before, but nothing like the Eater of Worlds. Less a character than a force of nature, Galactus marked the beginning of the Cosmic Age of comics, and he was preceded by his herald, one of the most noble of Lee and Kirby’s creations: the Silver Surfer. \nOn December 9th, 1965, Fantastic Four #48 gave us our first glimpse of Norrin Radd of Zenn-La, better known as the Silver Surfer. We’re going to assume you already have that material, so why not go in a different direction with this sweet T-shirt? While most superhero shirts are a little… over the top, shall we say, this minimalist design is hipster friendly and still expresses your inner geek bonafides. Just don’t yell “To me, my board!” when you request an Uber. \n$11.50-$32.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/8/2016 ALF: The Complete Series \nThe prospect of first contact with aliens gets more and more minute as we learn just how big the universe is and how unflinching the laws of physics seem to be. For a sentient life form to bridge the massive gap between their habitable planet and ours would take either an insanely long amount of time or an engine unlike any our science can comprehend. That’s sad news for 80s kids who grew up with ALF , the cult sitcom about a cat-eating alien who comes to live with a suburban California family. \nOriginally aired on NBC, you can get all four seasons of the show in a snappy box set from Amazon. While the jokes still hold up, ALF is also a cool geek time capsule to the state of space exploration in the Bush years. Some episodes dealt with then-current NASA discoveries, so if you’re nostalgic for the days when Pluto was a planet, it’ll give you the warm fuzzies. \n$39.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/7/2016 20 Grams Of Gallium \nAmazon started off selling just one thing: books. And they sold a lot of books, so they decided to start selling CDs and DVDs. And they sold a lot of those, so they decided to start selling all kinds of other crap, too, and now we’re in the modern era where you can send away for 20 grams of 99.99% pure gallium as easy as ordering a pizza. \nWhat is gallium? It’s a fascinating metal that barely qualifies as one, having the second-largest “liquid range” of any metal. That means it flows like sticky pudding at room temperature, but quickly hardens and becomes brittle when it cools a tiny bit. As it freezes, it also expands like water, which is unusual in a metal. What are you going to do with it? Whatever the hell you want, buddy! It corrodes other metals, leaves indelible gray markings on nearly any surface, and refuses to crystallize, making it fun to make fragile duplicates of other items. \n$11.80 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/6/2016 Doctor Who: Whographica \nOn December 6, 1989, one of the most important sagas in science fiction history came to a close. That was the air date for the very last episode of the original Doctor Who series, which reached 26 seasons on the BBC after premiering in 1963. That’s 26 years, if you can’t do that Time Lord math. It’d be another decade and change before the occupant of the Tardis made his return to the airwaves, but a lot of plot happened in those 26 years. \nThe Who timeline is insanely difficult to follow, and you could certainly print out a million Wikipedia pages and read them on the toilet, but we have a better way. Meet Whographica , a seriously badass 224 page collection of charts, tables and graphics that put the show’s entire run into perspective. It’s an incredible way to look at all of this lore visually. We recommend it highly. \n$12.81 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/5/2016 Fast & Furious 7-Movie Collection \nWho would have thought that the Fast & Furious series would somehow become the most beloved action movie franchise in the world? What started out as a simple tale of street racers and hijacking in 2001 has ballooned into a massive cinematic universe that crosses the globe multiple times to give us some of the most batcrap crazy stunts ever put on film. And it’s fair to argue that the series was an important stepping stone towards making Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson one of the most popular movie stars in the world. \nWant to watch this remarkable evolution take place through seven films of twisted steel and sex appeal? You’re in luck. We found an insane deal on Blu-Ray versions of the entire series to date for just 28 bucks – four dollars a film. That’s cheaper than a matinee. Pop some nitro in your system and get ready to live your life a quarter-mile at a time for the next 14 hours or so. \n$27.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/2/2016 Five Nights At Freddy’s Backstage Construction Set \nThe Five Nights At Freddy’s phenomenon is one of the most unlikely success stories of the last decade. A hinky indie game made by a fundamentalist Christian about working nights at a pizza parlor somehow transformed itself into a huge cultural phenomenon with multiple sequels, a book, and even an upcoming movie. Oh, and of course there’s toys. From MacFarlane, the industry leader in disturbingly realistic plastic, you can now have your own miniature backstage area to look at in terror while you work. \nThis 153-piece construction set lets you build the workspace where the malfunctioning animatronics hang out, and comes with a Withered Chica figure as well as a spare endoskeleton and a bunch of character heads. It’s one of several construction sets for the game from MacFarlane, but this one is our favorite. \n$26.98 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 12/1/2016 Turbo Kid Soundtrack \nOne of the few good developments in this hell century has been a new appreciation for the balls-out low-budget sci-fi action flicks of the late 1980s and early 1990s. That was a glorious time for practical effects and buckets of blood. One of our absolute favorite throwback films of 2015 was Turbo Kid , which took equal parts Mad Max and Mega Man and threw them in a blender to create a gory, wild and emotionally affecting story of love and heroism in the wasteland. \nYou can stream that movie for free on Netflix so we’re not going to make you buy it here, but what you really should get is the absolutely luxurious collector’s edition soundtrack by Le Matos. Limited to just 1000 copies, this 2x 180 black vinyl record set contains the film’s complete music in a glorious package. Any fans of John Carpenter or 80s synthpop needs to have this in their library. \n$42.29 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 11/30/2016 Magnus Robot Fighter: Flesh And Steel \nIf you want to talk about one of the most serious paranoias of the modern age, being replaced by a robot is right up there. With Westworld dominating the geek conversation, it might be nice to look back at one of the more influential man vs. robot comics of the last century – Gold Key’s Magnus, Robot Fighter , created by Russ Manning and first hitting newsstands on November 30, 1963. The tunic-wearing martial artist practiced a discipline that let him smash steel with his bare hands, and the character has survived in various forms from various publishers. \nDynamite bought the rights to Magnus and a few other Gold Key characters in 2013 and rebooted the title, and it’s been a fun read so far. Magnus now lives in a world with deceptively humanlike robots integrated into regular society, and both sides are equally complicit in bad deeds. It’s a solid 12-issue run that you can get into at a good price. \n$12.85 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 11/29/2016 Xtronaut \nWinter is most definitely board game season, and all throughout the next month or so we’ll be highlighting some new favorites and old classics to play with family and friends. Let’s start off with a recently Kickstarted game that scratches just about every one of our geek itches. It’s a seriously techy take on space exploration called Xtronaut from the leader of the NASA OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission. \nHere’s how it works: each player is the director of a launch complex, struggling to complete their mission before other players do. You can take part in all the political and financial intrigue of the real-life space program, as well as collaborate and betray other players. The basic rules are simple to learn but the game has a ton of depth and replayability. Add it to your collection before the snow hits. \n$29.74 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 11/28/2016 Livid Minim Wireless Controller \nIt’s never been easier to make music for fun and profit. Gone are the days of painstakingly learning how to play an instrument, replaced by electronic gadgets and gew-gaws that let us conjure any sound in the world at the press of a button. If you want to get in on this racket – and really, why shouldn’t you – you’re going to need some hardware. Meet the Livid Minim Wireless Controller. This unique device links up wirelessly with an iOS app to let you craft all kinds of music with just your fingers. \nWe like the Livid Minim for a few reasons. First and foremost is the seriously 90s retro industrial design – it looks like something Alpha would use on Power Rangers , all pastel neons and beveled edges. Second is the user-friendly nature of the hardware. Eight big pads and fifteen buttons give you enough space to experiment without overloading you with options. It also has 3D motion control, so you can modify your sound simply by picking the thing up and changing its position. Audio pros are giving it unanimously good reviews, and at this price how can you go wrong? \n$129.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here 11/24/2016 World’s Largest Gummi Worm \nIf you’re anything like most Americans, today is the day when you gorge yourself on turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing and other traditional Thanksgiving dishes. And looming on the horizon is one of the most dreaded events on the calendar: the post-Thanksgiving potluck. Everybody brings their leftovers over and they’re glumly picked over by people who have been eating the same stuff for days. \nBe the hero of your next potluck by showing up with something completely unexpected: a three pound gummi worm. This massive hunk of slithering sweetness is deeply disturbing looking but apparently tastes great. The product description on Amazon reads as follows:– blue", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:04:52.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
