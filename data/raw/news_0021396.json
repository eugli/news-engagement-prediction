Wolves FC prepares for the 2017 United Premier Soccer League (UPSL) season and its upcoming Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup fixtures in April.L.A. Wolves FC Head Coach Eric Wynalda said, \"The decision to return to coaching wasn't one that I made quickly, so it was a matter of finding the right opportunity at the right time. L.A.
