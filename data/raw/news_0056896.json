They're being used to watch live sport, films and subscription TV channels without forking out for for the costly fees. \nBut a crackdown has begun by the likes of Greater Manchester Police, initially targeting those who sell 'fully-loaded' Kodi boxes, which come complete with the legal Kodi software, plus add-ons that allow users to streams of content that breach copyright. \nFive people have been arrested for selling those boxes, and now many people are asking whether they could get in trouble for owning a Kodi box. \nUK Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT) is a trade organisation established to protect and represent the interests of intellectual property - here's their stance on the matter. What is Kodi? \nKodi is a free media player that can run on any computer, smartphone, tablet or set-top box, allowing users to stream films and TV programmes over the internet. \nA \"Kodi box\" is a set-top box or the Kodi media player can be installed on a streaming stick like the Amazon Fire. Is it legal? \nThe software itself is not illegal, nor is it illegal to sell devices with Kodi pre-installed on them. \nHowever, many of these Kodi devices come pre-loaded with third party plug-ins and add-ons that allow users to stream pirated content to their TV. \nSelling these \"fully loaded\" TV set-top devices is a breach of the Copyright, Designs and Patent Act 1988. \nIndividuals involved in this crime may also be breaking the Fraud Act, and be charged with money laundering offences, according to FACT. Read More Kodi tips and hacks - while staying on the right side of the law Who is the crackdown targeting? \nThe latest crackdown by FACT, Greater Manchester Police , City of London Police and the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) is targeting those involved in the sale and distribution of these illegal \"fully loaded\" devices. \nFACT's priority is to \"disrupt and combat individuals manufacturing, importing, selling and re-selling these illegal devices\". \nWhile the end user is not a target, they could get swept up in one of FACT's operations, and could become part of the whole criminal investigation, the organisation said. \nOf course, this doesn't stop people from buying \"clean\" Kodi boxes, and then downloading the copyright infringing add-ons themselves. \nMany people also download the Kodi media player onto another TV streaming device - such as a Google Chromecast or Amazon Fire TV Stick - and install the plug-ins from there. What are the penalties? \nThe penalties for sellers are high - it could result in time behind bars. \nIn December 2016, Terry O'Reilly was sentenced to four years imprisonment for selling illegal set-top TV boxes, a prosecution brought by the Premier League with support from FACT. What about me? \nFACT claims that, \"if you are accessing premium pay-for content, like Sky, BT Sport and Virgin Media, and you do not have a subscription with an official provider then this is unlawful access\". \nHowever, it is unclear exactly what law you would be breaking. \nIf you were to download an illegally copied file, that would constitute copyright infringement. However, when you stream something online, the file is stored only temporarily on your computer - and temporary copies are exempt from copyright laws. \nIn a landmark ruling in 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that internet users who look at copyrighted material online aren't breaking the law by doing so, citing Article 5.1 of the EU Copyright Directive. \nIt stated that copies of copyrighted material that appear \"on the users computer screen\" and \"in the internet 'cache' of that computer's hard disk\" are \"temporary\" and \"may therefore be made without the authorisation of the copyright holders\". \nMorally, of course, it's a completely different matter. \nAnyone accessing content from a pirate site is involving themselves in unlawful behaviour, often putting money into the hands of criminals. \nThey are also undermining the legitimate sale of subscription TV services, which employ tens of thousands of people in the UK, and whose contributions are key to the creative and sporting industries. \nFurthermore, accessing illegal sites can leave your computer vulnerable to viruses and other harmful content.
