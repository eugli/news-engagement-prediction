When he left the bar, staff called a cab and went outside to try to stop him from driving. \nWhen the cab showed up, Gress sent it away. \nGress drove to another pub where he was also cut off and asked to leave because of his “high intoxication level.” Witnesses saw him drive away so they called 911. \nSoon after, Gress – who had two prior convictions for impaired driving and six prior speeding convictions – drove into the back of a Chevrolet Cavalier in the area of 167 Avenue and 59A Street. The Cavalier spun into the opposite lane, where it collided with a Mitsubishi Lancer. \nRussell House, the passenger of the Cavalier and a father of two, was thrown from the vehicle and died. The driver was taken to hospital with upper-body fractures and a collapsed lung. He remained in hospital for months. \nREAD MORE: St. Albert man charged with manslaughter after fatal hit-and-run crash \nTwo others were taken to hospital, one with a fractured ankle. The other suffered a broken collarbone and spinal injury. Gress was not injured. \nAfter the collision, Gress drove from the scene and hit a tree before colliding with a wooden fence. He then ran away on foot before eventually catching a cab home to St. Albert. \nThe Crown was seeking a sentence of eight to 10 years, while the defence was seeking seven to eight years. \nRussell House pictured with his kids, Jaysel (now 11) and Jadis (now 3).
