I would like to welcome the honourable member,\" said Mbete. \nOpposition MPs booed as Mbete made the announcement. \n\"Where is that corrupt bastard?\" asked the EFF's Moses Mbatha, who was then called to order by an ANC MP. Mbete asked Mbatha to withdraw his remark, but he refused. \n\"I will recognise your voice in the Hansard recording,\" Mbete promised. \nEFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu asked Mbete \"since when\" does parliament's communication department make announcements on behalf of political parties. \nHe was referring to a press release by parliament announcing Molefe's appointment. \n\"We will not be abused by the Guptas,\" said Shivambu. \nCOPE MP Deidre Carter also made jibes about Molefe. \n\"True north changed direction in this House because my immorality compass is [pointing] direct to the Honourable Molefe,\" said Carter. \nA few hours earlier, Molefe had received a warm welcome from the ANC caucus at its weekly meeting. \nDA finance spokesman David Maynier said the fact that the \"disgraced\" former Eskom group chief executive was sworn in as an MP was a \"major escalation in the civil war within the ruling party and the battle for control of the Treasury being driven by President Jacob Zuma. Brian Molefe 'sworn in as MP' \n\"We cannot be sure but it will presumably not be long before Brian Molefe is appointed to the finance committee to serve time before being appointed deputy minister of finance with a view to controlling the R1.8-trillion managed by the Public Investment Corporation,\" said Maynier. \nMolefe left Eskom under a cloud in November after damning findings about him in the public protector's State of Capture report. \nThe report, which looked at allegations of state capture involving the Gupta brothers - Atul, Ajay and Rajesh - who are close friends of Zuma, highlighted Molefe's relationships with the family, which he is said to have visited repeatedly at their Saxonwold home. \nMolefe, who cried over the allegations during a press conference shortly after the report was released, famously denied visiting the Guptas, saying he could have been going to a shebeen in the neighbourhood. \nMolefe is said to be headed to the finance portfolio committee, a member of which, Makhosi Khoza, has been redeployed to the public service and administration committee. Small Business Minister Lindiwe Zulu used social media site Instagram to express her delight at Molefe's swearing-in, saying \"change must happen\". \nThe Industrial Development Corporation has announced Molefe's resignation from its board.
