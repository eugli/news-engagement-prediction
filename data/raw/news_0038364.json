After being traded for decades as a bootleg among fans, that concert is now getting its first official release for its 40th anniversary. The entire performance has been remastered from the original recordings and will be available in a 3xCD and 5xLP set. It will also be released as part of an 11xCD box set, May 1977: Get Shown the Light , that includes three other previously unreleased concerts from that era. All three versions are available to pre-order from the band’s website and are set for release on May 5. Listen to the Cornell 1977 version of “Morning Dew” below. \nThe Grateful Dead recently announced plans to reissue their entire catalogue in honor of their 50th anniversary. The first of those reissues, 1967’s Grateful Dead , arrived last month. \nCheck out the Grateful Dead’s episode of “Liner Notes” on Pitchfork.tv: Artists In This Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:12:00.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
