BBC Kris Marshall plays Detective Inspector Humphrey Goodman in the BBC series. \nThe show’s hectic filming schedule and remote location are believed to be behind Kris’s decision to quit, and he says he’s now looking forward to spending more time with his family. \nKris said: “Death in Paradise has been an incredible experience, six months every year filming on a tropical island in the sunshine – what’s not to love! \n“Humphrey was socially awkward and clumsy but also brilliant, I’ll miss him but it’s time to hand over to someone new and spend more time with my family.” \nThe 43-year-old actor joined the programme at the beginning of the third series, following the exit of Ben Miller. \n‘Father Ted’ star Ardal O’Hanlon has already been confirmed as the lead in the show’s seventh series.

I’ve already had a taste of filming in Guadeloupe and can’t wait to get back.” \nKris added: “I know Ardal will do a superb job and I just hope Humphrey gets a happy ending.” BBC \nKris’s decision to quit ‘Death In Paradise’ comes as a surprise, as only last month he told HuffPost UK that he could “see myself doing this for ten years”. \nHe told us: “The show is bigger than me. It’s one of those shows that has and can survive cast changes. If it does, then – could I see myself doing this for ten years? Yes.” \nBut the 43-year-old also hinted that being apart from his wife and two young children for extended periods of filming in the Caribbean, could be the reason he wouldn’t be in it for the long haul. \nHe added: “Other constraints come into play. It’s a long time away from family, real life gets in the way sometimes. The show’s bigger than me, obviously. We’ll see. How long is a piece of string?” \nFour years, it seems. \n‘Death in Paradise’ continues tonight on BBC One at 9pm. Top 10 Favourite TV Drama Moments Top 10 Favourite TV Drama Moments 1 10 10.
