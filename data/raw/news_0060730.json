Clinton Police Department/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY. EDITORIAL USE ... He declined to elaborate on the details of the incident or the motive for the shooting.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation was looking at whether it was a hate crime, the official term for crimes motivated by bias or prejudice. A FBI spokeswoman said agents and police canvassed the area on Thursday and the investigation continued on Friday.\nPurinton is accused of killing Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, and wounding Alok Madasani, also 32, in Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas, on Wednesday evening, police said.\nAt least one bystander told the Kansas City Star the gunman shouted \"get out of my country\" before shooting the Indian victims.\nPurinton is also accused of wounding American Ian Grillot, 24, who was shot as he tried to intervene.\n\"People call me a hero,\" Grillot said in a video released by the hospital where he was undergoing treatment for gunshot wounds to the hand and chest. \"I was just doing what anyone should have done for any other human being.\"\nThe suspect fled on foot and was arrested without incident five hours later at an Applebee's restaurant in Clinton, Missouri. He reportedly told an employee there he needed a place to hide because he had killed two Middle Eastern men, the Star reported.\nPurinton, a former Federal Aviation Administration employee, was transferred back to Kansas on Friday and was being held at the Johnson County jail with bond set at $2 million, according to jail records.\nHe is scheduled to appear in court on Monday. It was not immediately known whether he had hired a lawyer.\nPolice did not say whether Purinton has faced charges in the past. However, he was not generally known to police in Olathe, a city of 134,000 people about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Kansas City, Sergeant Logan Bonney said by phone on Friday.\nKansas Governor Sam Brownback, a Republican, condemned the killing. \"This sort of senseless violence is never acceptable,\" he said in a statement.\n'BE ANGRY!'\n© REUTERS TV/REUTERS/Reuters A still image taken from a video shows the brother of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, who was shot dead in a possible hate crime in Kansas state of the U.S., talking to the media in Hyderabad, Telangana, India, February 24, 2017.

NO THIRD PARTY SALES. INDIA OUT. MANDATORY ... At Kuchibhotla's family home near the Indian tech hub of Hyderabad, relatives backed government calls to ensure the safety of Indians living in the United States.\n\"The government should voice out this strongly because our brothers, sisters and our relatives are there,\" the victim's brother, Venu Madhav, told Reuters Television outside their home.\nThrough a window, relatives could be seen sitting quietly, one woman wiping away tears.\nMany Indians initially welcomed Trump's election, seeing his calls to restrict Muslim immigration as support for their Hindu-majority country. The nation has been at odds for decades with Pakistan, its mainly Muslim neighbor.\nBut the Trump administration may also have skilled Indian workers like Kuchibhotla in mind as it considers curbing the H-1B visa program, worrying both India's $150 billion IT services industry and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.\n\"Don't be shocked! Be angry!\" Siddharth, a well-known South Indian actor who uses one name, tweeted to his 2.6 million followers in remarks echoed across social media. \"Trump is spreading hate. This is a hate crime! RIP #SrinivasKuchibhotla.\"\nKavipriya Muthuramalingam, a former colleague of the victim, said his friend was one of the nicest, most gentle people one could meet. \"He was non-confrontational, non-controversial, easy-going, always smiling,\" Muthuramalingam said.\nA candle light vigil was planned for Friday evening at the First Baptist Church of Olathe, across the road from the bar.\nKuchibhotla received a master's in electronics from the University of Texas in El Paso in 2007, according to LinkedIn. He was married but had no children.\nHis Facebook page, where he called himself \"Srinu,\" said that in 2014 he joined the Kansas office of Switzerland-based navigation device maker Garmin from Rockwell Collins Inc.\nFlags at Garmin's offices flew at half-staff on Friday. The company said it was \"devastated by the senseless tragedy.\"\n\"Srinivas was a valued member of our engineering team and will be greatly missed,\" Garmin said on Facebook.\n(Reporting by Dave Kaup in Kansas City and Aditya Kalra in New Delhi; Additional reporting by David Ingram in New York, Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee and Ayesha Rascoe in Washington; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Grant McCool)\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAnkbUN%3focid%3dsl&title=Kansas+man+charged+with+fatal+shooting+in+possible+hate+crime&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAnkbUN%3focid%3dsl", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA9UODq.img", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/0aada84a-dacd-438f-a230-5b307c96fa9c/3e3a67c4-c923-49e3-bcb3-d4a94a4a8126.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://rmb.reuters.com/rmd/rest/xml/item?id=tag:reuters.com,2017:newsml_OV64VXQSF:1&entityMarkupField=all&token=tO55qum7XNBY3x1h69nSnYppAkUvG25DyfbfQ+HdRaQ=&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerName&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnkbUN?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnkbUN?blobrefkey=104&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;768&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;432&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAnkbUN%3focid%3dst&text=Kansas+man+charged+with+fatal+shooting+in+possible+hate+crime&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAnkbUN%3focid%3dst", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnkbUN?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnkbUN?blobrefkey=103&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;768&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;432&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/0aada84a-d", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA3e1oO.img", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAnkbUN&lang=en-us&flow_id=55804002-b16b-45f7-9597-10d6960e3bbc", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnkbUL.img&quot;}}", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnkbUN?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBnMzWD.img"], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:56:05.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
