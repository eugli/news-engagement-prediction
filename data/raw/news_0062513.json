Meanwhile, Republican congressmen are getting dragged through the mud by their constituents in massive town hall assemblies across the country. \n“Look, it’s not easy being a member of Congress these days, facing down angry voters at rowdy town halls, standing under those hot lights, getting yelled at by your constituents. I’m sure they’d love to get out of there and just relax for a while, like this guy,” Meyers said, pointing to a photo of Trump. \n“Trump and Republicans in Congress are facing a massive backlash over their plan to repeal ObamaCare, because they have nothing better to offer,” he added, joking that “we’re all gonna need Tums, as I’m pretty sure it’s the thing Republicans have for a replacement to Obamacare. With Tums and Advil, you get to choose your own healthcare: Tums or Advil.” \nWatch Meyers in the clip above.
