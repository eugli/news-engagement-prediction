PUBLISHED: 06:29, Sun, Feb 26, 2017 | UPDATED: 06:39, Sun, Feb 26, 2017 GETTY Northern Ireland voted strongly to Remain in the EU \nGeorge Mitchell, the US Senator who brokered the Good Friday agreement 18 years ago and helped bring calm to a chaotic Northern Ireland, claimed leaving the EU could limit hopes of further cooperation to the region. \nHe said: \"I believe that the European Union was an important factor that led the United Kingdom and Ireland to co-operate in establishing a process that led to the Good Friday Agreement and I think the UK being out of the European Union may reduce the prospect for further co-operation. \n\"We recognised at the time that by itself, the agreement did not assure peace or prosperity or reconciliation. It made them possible. \n“So what I said at the time was that it would take many years and many difficult decisions by courageous leaders in Northern Ireland to attain those goals.\" GETTY George Mitchell brokered the Good Friday agreement 18 years ago Related articles Ireland wants Britain to remain 'AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE' to the EU \nNorthern Ireland voted strongly to Remain in the EU with 55 per cent of voters backing the European bloc. \nAnd Mr Mitchell claims that tearing the country out of the EU will scupper hopes that Dublin could begin power sharing by choice instead of a mandatory coalition. \nHe added: \"I think everyone anticipated that these arrangements were established to meet the problems and the needs of that time… it is a normal part of the development of every society that over time institutions should be reviewed, processes should be reviewed.\" \nIt comes after Dublin demanded that a clause must be inserted into any divorce deal allowing Northern Ireland to automatically rejoin the EU. GETTY Mr Mitchell claims Brexit could scupper plans for evolving politics in the country \nTaioseach Enda Kenny told reporters that elements of the Good Friday Agreement, which is underpinned by Brussels, should be written into any Brexit agreement to hand Belfast the power to remain in the bloc. \nIreland's insistence that Belfast's right to EU membership be enshrined within the exit agreement will provide cheer to many remain voters, but provides a serious headache for Theresa May ahead of the negotiations. \nMr Kenny told reporters in Brussels: \"We want that to remain in such a position that the language of what’s contained in the Good Friday Agreement will also be contained in the negotiation outcome. GETTY The US senator Brokered the deal under the Clinton administration \n\"In other words, that if at some future time whenever that might be, that Northern Ireland would have ease of access to join as a member of the EU again. \n\"We want that language inserted into the negotiated outcome.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T08:40:53.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
