Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have a big news. Last month, the reality star unveiled some of her husband's Adidas designs on Snapchat after breaking her Internet sabbatical. Now it seems that she is back to business with her next social media reveal: the couple's latest project, which comes in the form of a children’s clothing line. You May Also Like Fashion We've Been Pronouncing \"Adidas\" Wrong This Whole Time Kim posted a photo of her daughter, North, modeling a yellow sequined dress and a matching jacket worn with a pair of low-top Vans. She captioned the photo, “Kanye & my kids line coming soon! #SequinDress #ShearlingCoat.” She then posted a video of North wearing the same outfit and explained that her daughter picked out the colors and the fabrics for some of the pieces in the as-of-yet unnamed collection. Last night, we saw the new clothes in action when the pair was seen at a performance of Swan Lake in New York City. The mother and daughter have a history of wearing matching looks—such as the sequined silver dresses they wore when they attended Kanye’s concert in 2016, so we wouldn’t be surprised if the upcoming kids collection has more than a few Kim-inspired looks. North also has an affinity for tutus, so we might even see some Yeezy-infused ballet looks down the line, when the collection makes its full debut.
