The townspeople get it. \nDespite her character’s unconventional behavior, there is something enchanting about actress Emma Watson singing, “Belle,” the opening song to “ Beauty and the Beast ,” or, as you might say during trivia, “That One Bonjour Song.” Perhaps the most enchanting thing is a possible nod to Watson’s “Harry Potter” role. \nIn the original song for Disney’s animated “Beauty and the Beast,” Belle has a chat with the baker who dismisses her, saying, “ That’s nice. Marie ! The baguettes !” \n(LOL, Marie. Who could forget the baguettes?) \nBut the new version has a noticeable change ... \n“Good morning, Monsieur Jean. Have you lost something again?” asks Watson’s character. \n“I believe I have. Problem is, I can’t remember what,” says Monsieur Jean. \nUh, what? Who the heck is Monsieur Jean? Where’s the line about the baguettes? Marie! The baguettes! \nTale as old as time? This is more like a tale as old as crime! \nUntil you remember “ Harry Potter ” ... \nIn “ Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone ,” there’s a scene where Neville gets a Remembrall. Watson’s character, Hermione, explains what that means, saying, “I’ve read about those. When the smoke turns red, it means you’ve forgotten something.” \nNeville replies, “The only problem is, I can’t remember what I’ve forgotten.” \nWh t????", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:29:30.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
