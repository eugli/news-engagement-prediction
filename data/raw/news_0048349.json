We just want some answers.\" \nAfter the mystery collapse, Carl was rushed to hospital but medics were unable to save him and he died on February 1. \nPam and Carl's father Chris followed their son's wish to donate his organs , which have already gone to help three seriously ill patients. \nThey are now anxiously waiting for test results that they hope will reveal what caused Carl's death.

I heard him make a noise, and when I went up he was just collapsed on the floor.\" \nA neighbour performed CPR on Carl, who worked for a chemicals firm in Leek, Staffordshire, before he was taken to Royal Stoke University Hospital. \nDoctors told his parents and 22-year-old sister Laura that nothing could be done to save him.

He was on the organ donor register. \n\"He had thought about it and made the decision, and he had made it clear to me that I must not countermand his wishes. \n\"We believe he has saved three people â€“ his liver, pancreas and kidneys were donated. A bit of good has come out of adversity. It's the only thing that has made any sense out of all this.\" \nCarl had no history of medical problems apart from a recent bout tonsillitis, for which he was prescribed antibiotics. \nPam said: \"He had a lot to look forward to. He loved his job and had just started a junior management course, and he had got himself a new car which he thought was the bee's knees. \n\"He was going to Las Vegas on holiday with his mates. He was very sociable and he was happy.\" \nChris added: \"He was very strong-minded. He had a crafty sense of humour, but he didn't do it with any malice. We have nobody or nothing to blame for his death. We are just in shock.\" \nCarl's funeral will be held at Bradwell Crematorium in Newcastle-under-Lyme on Wednesday. \nDonations will go to the Critical Care Unit at the Royal Stoke University Hospital.
