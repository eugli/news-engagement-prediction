Holmes, who finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds, then added two free throws after a Jones miss. \nThe Lady Bears (23-2, 12-1) had won 55 straight home games since losing to West Virginia on March 2, 2014. \nBrooke McCarthy had 22 points for the Longhorns, who take over the nation's second-longest winning streak behind top-ranked UConn's 97 wins in a row. Ariel Atkins had 20 points and Lashann Higgs 16. \nKalani Brown had 24 points for Baylor, while Jones had all 19 of her points after halftime. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
