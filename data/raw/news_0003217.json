But violence is different for women on extreme levels because we are targeted for sex,\" she said from her home in Georgina Island, Ont.\n\n'All voices' welcome \nRepresentatives from Indigenous women's organization say, after speaking with the commissioners Wednesday, they are relieved to hear the scope of the inquiry is not expanding.\n\"NWAC welcomes the inclusion of all voices,\" a spokesperson from the Native Women's Association of Canada said in an email to CBC News.\n\"Families and community members will be invited to share their experiences insofar as this potential information may be relevant to its overall mandate of examining systemic causes of violence, including sexual violence, against Indigenous women and girls,\" Amy Ede said.\n\nHutchinson said the inquiry's testimonies are set to begin this spring and said the regional meetings will take place over the next few months across Canada. \n\nThe national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women is expected to take two years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:09:38.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
