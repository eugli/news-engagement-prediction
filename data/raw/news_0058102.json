Chong Wei even threatened to leave BAM. \nFrost, in a bid to defuse the escalating tension, came up with the proposal. \n“It was a proposal by Frost ... but we have made some adjustments to it. This special project is solely for Chong Wei and his team and it’s to prepare him for this year’s world meet,” BAM coaching and training committee (C&T) chairman Datuk Seri Norza Zakaria. \n“Hendrawan will be the chief coach leading that project. He will also be a C&T committee member and he will report directly to the committee. \n“As for the other players in the project, there are no significant changes to their roles. \n“This is just a more focused change in order to help Chong Wei in his World Championships preparations. \n“Of course, this project will tentatively last until the world meet ... after that it will be up for a review,” added Norza, who is also BAM deputy president. \nFrost, meanwhile, believes that the decision was the “best way forward” for all parties to make progress. \n“This decision is made to help Chong Wei win the world title and I wish him all the best. But I also hope the others in the project will benefit from it,” said the Dane. \n“I will not have any say in this project ... it’s not a problem. It’s only fair that Hendrawan takes charge and he will be accountable to the C&T directly.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:51:24.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
