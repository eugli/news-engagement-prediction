Police said it was one of the most extensive collections of child porn they’ve seen.\nOfficers executed a search warrant in the 700-block of Fisgard Street, where he was staying, on March 10, 2015 and discovered over 20 pieces of evidence related to the investigation.\nIn the end, police seized 775 videos containing 139 hours of material, and 27,000 images, all confirmed to be child pornography.\nPolice issued a warrant for Stallcup’s arrest in April 2015 but learned he was using a false name, David Robert, and that he was in jail in Oregon.\nInvestigators also learned Stallcup had been dodging police in different states, from Colorado to Alaska to Montana, on outstanding charges, creating false identities to evade them.\nAt some point, he obtained a Registered Nurse certificate in the Northwest Territories and police said he had been working at a local Victoria facility.\nThe B.C. College of Registered Nurses released a statement in May 2015 that a man named David Turner Robert was working as a RN for a B.C. employer despite not having practising registration.\nPolice worked with Oregon officials to have Stallcup extradited to Canada on Nov. 16, 2016.\nLast month an Oregon newspaper reported that Stallcup, using the name David Robert Rineheart, was running from authorities for more than a decade before he was caught. \"I don't want to run anymore,\" he told a judge, as reported by The Oreganian. \"I'm sick of it...I like staying in the same place.\"\nHe now remains in Victoria police custody and will soon face sentencing for the guilty plea.\nHis next court appearance is Feb. 9.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:12:23.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
