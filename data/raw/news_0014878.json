Chris Perkins great Jason Taylor was elevated to legendary status when he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday.\nTaylor, who played 15 seasons in the NFL , 13 with the Dolphins, was a six-time Pro Bowl selection and ranks seventh in league history with 139.5 sacks. The angular defensive end and Plantation resident makes the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. \nTaylor and the other members of the Class of 2017 will be inducted into the Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, in August. \nElected by a panel of football writers, Taylor joins coach Don Shula, linebacker Nick Buoniconti, running back Larry Csonka, quarterback Bob Griese, center Jim Langer, guard Larry Little, quarterback Dan Marino , center Dwight Stephenson and wide receiver Paul Warfield as Dolphins Hall of Fame selections. \n“I love Jason,” Marino said. “Jason was a teammate of mine, and I think he belongs in the Hall of Fame, without a doubt.” \nIn an interview with the Sun Sentinel on Friday , Taylor said he wasn't nervous as he awaited Saturday's election in Houston on the eve of Super Bowl LI. \nSee photos of Dolphins great Jason Taylor through the years. \n\"Whatever happens, happens,\" he said. \"You've done the work for the length of your career. I didn't think I'd get to be a finalist my first year. ... I didn't know if I was good enough to even be considered for an honor like [the Hall of Fame]. \n\"Now they [have] me in a room with all these Hall of Fame finalists. It's mind-blowing to me.\" \nTaylor, the Dolphins’ third-round pick from the University of Akron in 1997, became known for his big-play ability. His nine touchdowns are the most in NFL history for a defensive lineman. His six fumble recoveries for touchdowns are the most in NFL history. And his 29 fumble recoveries are tied for most in NFL history. \nThere are 13 members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame who were employed by the Miami Dolphins. Here they are, in order of length of service in Miami. \nIn addition, Taylor, a member of the NFL’s All-Decade Team for the 2000s, had eight interceptions, three safeties and led the NFL in sacks in 2002 with a career-best 18.5. \n“J.T. is definitely deserving, not just of being in the Hall of Fame, but of being a first-ballot guy,” said former Dolphins linebacker Zach Thomas , Taylor’s longtime teammate and brother-in-law (Taylor married Thomas’ sister). “I can say this with confidence because I saw it first hand, for a long, long time.” \nAs a topper, Taylor won the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award in 2007, which recognizes community service as well as on-field performance. \n“He’s really a good guy, very respectful, just a quality guy,” said Stephenson, the Dolphins’ Hall of Fame center and winner of the Walter Payton Award in 1985. \n“You want to see good things happen to good guys, and Jason Taylor is a good guy.” \nTaylor, drafted by former Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson , didn’t take long to make his presence known in the NFL. \nFrom 2000-2011, no player had more sacks than Taylor’s 123. Taylor had six double-digit sack seasons in the eight-year span from 2000-07. \n“He was impact player at a high level for a lot of years, a lot of years,” Marino said. “A cat that could change the game in a minute as far as intercepting the ball, picking up a fumble, making a sack, whatever it may be, just a great, great player.” \nThomas, like Marino, cited Taylor’s play-making skill as his most distinguishing trait. \n“He was such an impact player,” Thomas said. “The sacks speak from themselves, but there are a lot of guys who just have sacks. J.T. did so many things to disrupt the game -- the forced fumbles, the interceptions, the touchdowns; he just impacted games so much. \n“And it wasn't just the stats you can measure. When you think about hurries, hits on the quarterback, things that don’t even show up in the stats, he was doing them all. He must have been the most annoying guy in the league for a quarterback to play against.” \nDefensive tackle Tim Bowens, who shared defensive line duties with Taylor for eight seasons (1997-2004), also pointed to Taylor’s play-making ability as a distinguishing characteristic. \n“The guy made plays,” Bowens said. “When you turned the TV on, that was one of the guys you wanted to watch.” \nAlthough Taylor was regarded as undersized at 6-foot-6, and around 235-240 pounds, Bowens said his competitive nature allowed him to excel. \n“He was very, very, very, very, very, very competitive,” Bowens said with a laugh. \nBowens said Taylor’s fiery competitiveness showed not only on the field, but also in the weight room and in the locker room. \n“He might go off or something,” Bowens said, adding with a laugh, “there’s a lot of stuff that he did that I can’t really talk about.” \nBut his former teammates agreed Taylor had an undeniable ability to impact games. \nIn 2006, when he won Defensive Player of the Year, Taylor, who sometimes lined up at linebacker, compiled 13.5 sacks, 10 forced fumbles and two interceptions, both of which he returned for touchdowns. \n“I can't imagine him not being the Defensive Player of the Year this year,” New England coach Bill Belichick said at the time. \nTaylor, who appeared on the TV show “Dancing With the Stars” in 2008 and played for Washington (2008) and the New York Jets (2010), never reached a Super Bowl. But he appeared in nine playoff games, including six with the Dolphins. \n“He’s got all the things that make you a Hall of Famer – make people better around him, raising the level of play, doing things as well or better than anyone else in the National Football League and doing it for such a long time,” Stephenson said. \n“And then what he did off the field, too, as well. And I know some people don’t want to count that, but the guy’s a quality player and a quality guy off the field, too. So he’s a Hall of Famer by my standards.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:15:42.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
