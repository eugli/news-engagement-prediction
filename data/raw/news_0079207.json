If you take a closer look, Stone&apos;s Oscars look meant much more than just a lesson in red carpet slayage: Her ensemble carried a quiet political-slash-feminist statement, as well. On her left shoulder, right beneath the strap of her gown, Stone wore a gold Planned Parenthood pin.\nhttps://twitter.com/PPact/status/836044366972059648\nIt&apos;s easy to miss the pin at first glance, as it nearly blended in with her shimmery gown, but once you catch a glimpse of the reproductive-rights organization&apos;s logo on the outfit, it becomes nearly impossible to ignore. And Stone wasn&apos;t the only celeb to step out on the Oscars red carpet with the pin as an accessory: Dakota Johnson sported the same Planned Parenthood pin on her Gucci clutch for the evening.\nPinterest Facebook PHOTO: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic/Getty Images\nPinterest Facebook PHOTO: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic/Getty Images The displays of support for Planned Parenthood come at a critical time. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to defund the organization , which provides reproductive healthcare, education, and resources for millions of patients. The Planned Parenthood pins were not the only accessories-turned-political statements seen at the Academy Awards: Ruth Negga, Karlie Kloss, Busy Philipps, and Lin Manuel Miranda all wore blue ribbons in support of the American Civil Liberties Union.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PPact/status/836044366972059648", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.glamour.com%2Fstory%2Femma-stone-planned-parenthood-pin-2017-academy-awards%3Fmbid%3Dsocial_pinterest_referral&media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.glamour.com%2Fphotos%2F58b3a3aeb9c659631a59227d%2Fmaster%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FGettyImages-645662222.jpg&description=emma%20pin", "http://www.allure.com/story/oscars-2017-blue-ribbons", "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/24/donald-trump-signs-executive-order-defunding-inter/", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.glamour.com%2Fstory%2Femma-stone-planned-parenthood-pin-2017-academy-awards%3Fmbid%3Dsocial_pinterest_referral&media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.glamour.com%2Fphotos%2F58b3a3aeb9c659631a59227b%2Fmaster%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FGettyImages-645644086.jpg&description=emma%20pin", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.glamour.com%2Fstory%2Femma-stone-planned-parenthood-pin-2017-academy-awards%3Fmbid%3Dsocial_facebook_referral&t=emma%20pin", "https://twitter.com/ADGFashionStyle/status/835994186604249091?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2017-02-27T12:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:30:07.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
