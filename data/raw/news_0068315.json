While it’s a great time to upgrade your day-to-day staples, like a new tote bag for the office or a practical black dress, we challenge you to make a statement this spring with pieces like a tasseled bag, a pair of crystal-embellished shoes or a ruffled sweater. If these items aren’t within your comfort zone, not to worry. We’ve partnered with Nordstrom to select the perfect notice-me piece for every personality — from the glam girl to the denim darling. \nIf you believe that there’s no such thing as being overdressed, try a body skimming dress in an out-of-the box silhouette or step up your beauty routine with a sleek red lipstick. If you're more of the laid-back type, make a nod to the new season with a denim jacket with a touch of floral embroidery. If you're all about shoes, add a playfully bejeweled or printed pair to your rotation. No matter what your style mantra is, spring is the perfect time to have a little fun with your wardrobe. We'll be right here cheering you on. The Jet Setter \nTopshop swimsuit, Nordstrom . \nTravel is the name of your game and you look good doing it. This season's best swimwear comes with a little extra attention to detail — think: ruffles, lace-up silhouettes and touches of crochet. Try this off-the-shoulder one piece to bring chic to the beach. \nSam Edelman shoes, Nordstrom . \nThese luxe flats are comfortable enough for a day of sightseeing, but polished enough for dinner after dark. Pair them with a simple white dress and you're off. The Denim Darling \nT opshop jacket, Nordstrom . \nNothing makes a statement quite like an embellished piece of outerwear. If you love denim as much as we do, upgrade your average jean jacket for this topper in bloom. \nTopshop jeans, Nordstrom . \nConsider these the perfect pair of boyfriend jeans with a twist. When your jeans are embellished with a sequin flamingo and palm tree, how could you not be in a good mood? The Glam Girl \nChelsea 28 dress, Nordstrom . \nSlip into this refined midi dress for every occasion this spring. The scalloped detailing, open back, and mermaid silhouette make this number anything but a wallflower. \nCharlotte Tilbury lipstick in Carina’s Love, Nordstrom . \nAny glam girl knows that the perfect red lipstick takes every look to the next level. When the snow finally thaws, pair this fiery crimson shade with a clean complexion, bold brows, and a statement earring. The Savvy Shopper \nTreasure & Bond jacket, Nordstrom . \nThis jacket is ideal for spring's in-between weather. Cool mornings and brisk evenings are no problem with this layering piece that's under $120. Talk about a total score. \nTopshop sweater, Nordstrom . \nAdd a pop of color to your wardrobe this spring with a bold yellow sweater. There are so many things to love about this piece — ruffled shoulders, bell sleeves, and a classically crisp waist-skimming hem. The Accessories Aficionado \nRebecca Minkoff bag, Nordstrom . \nThis sleek white bag will go with just about anything in your closet this spring. Bonus: sophisticated woven detail make it suitable for any occasion — from Coachella to a day at the office. \nSam Edelman pumps, Nordstrom . \nDenim pumps with crystal bumble bees. Need I say more? \nThis post is sponsored by Nordstrom . \nImages: Unsplash; Nordstrom.
