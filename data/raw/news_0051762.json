It went from an average of 94.9 cents a litre in December to 106.8 cents a litre in January.\nIn Edmonton, it climbed by 11.2 cents a litre, from 89.7 in December to 100.9 in January.\nShutdowns late last year at refineries in Illinois and Indiana have also been linked to rising gas prices.\nNatural gas prices spike by 42.3% Natural gas prices spiked by 42.3 per cent year over year in January, also driven in part by the carbon tax, Statistics Canada said.\nTodd Hirsch, chief economist at ATB Financial, says the uptick in Alberta's inflation rate isn't worth getting excited about.\n\"The inflation increase was driven by two commodities in the basket of goods and services — that is gasoline and natural gas [for home heating]. Those commodities tend to be very, very volatile month over month,\" he said.\nThe cost of rent was flat on a monthly basis in January, but consumers paid 1.9 per cent less on a year-over-year basis — the largest decline among the provinces.\nShelter costs rose by 2.4 per cent across Canada.\nFrom January 2016 to January 2017, the electricity index declined by 8.2 per cent, more in Alberta than at the national level.\nNational inflation rate jumps to 2.1% Nationally, the cost of living rose by 2.1 per cent in January, compared to 1.5 per cent the previous month.\nA 6.3 per cent increase in transportation costs was the main contributor to the higher national inflation rate, with gas prices going up 20.6 per cent across the country, compared to the year before.\nThat increase coincided with the implementation of new carbon levies in Ontario and Alberta.\nExcluding gasoline costs, the national inflation rate in January was 1.5 per cent.\nOf the eight parts of the consumer economy that Statistics Canada tracks, only one got cheaper: consumers paid 2.1 per cent less for food in January than they did a year earlier, the fourth consecutive monthly decline.\nAlberta's cost of living increased 2.5 per cent in January 2017 on a year-over-year basis, compared to one per cent in December, Statistics Canada says.
