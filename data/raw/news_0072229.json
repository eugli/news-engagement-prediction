They carried photographs and files.\" Read more Video: Snowden Moscow arrival 'strange' \nSri Lankan police spokesman Priyantha Jayakodi said the allegation was \"a complete lie\". \n\"We have not done any investigation in Hong Kong or any other country on any refugee case,\" he told BBC Sinhala. \nHowever Mr Tibbo said the evidence came from Sri Lankans living in Hong Kong who were approached on the street in late December by people who carried official identification. \nHis clients fed and housed Mr Snowden for two weeks in June 2013 when he fled the US after leaking thousands of documents belonging to the US National Security Agency (NSA). \nThe former IT contractor subsequently left Hong Kong for Moscow. \nThe names of the asylum seekers, Kellapatha Supun Thilina and Debagma Kankanalamage Ajith Pushpa Kumara, were revealed last year by Mr Tibbo, ahead of the September premiere of the film Snowden by the director Oliver Stone. \nHe said that it would have been difficult to keep their identities secret after the film's release. \nMr Tibbo believes the Sri Lankan government began investigating the asylum seekers shortly afterwards.

Nobody can come in breach of Hong Kong law.\" \nThe asylum seekers have since moved to \"safer\" locations and have notified Hong Kong's immigration department. \nThey also plan to file a police report. \nMr Thilina, who arrived in Hong Kong in 2005, said he was frightened by the news. \n\"I am nervous and scared. I don't have a normal life now,\" he said. \nHis compatriot, Mr Kumara, an army deserter who served as an informal bodyguard to Mr Snowden in 2013, was also worried for his safety. \nThey are concerned about the prospect of being removed from Hong Kong and forcibly returned to Sri Lanka, where they say they could face violence and torture. \nMr Tibbo represents both men, along with Mr Snowden and Vanessa Rodel, an asylum seeker from the Philippines who also gave refuge to the US whistleblower in Hong Kong. \nHong Kong currently has about 10,000 asylum seekers, mainly from countries in South Asia and Africa.
