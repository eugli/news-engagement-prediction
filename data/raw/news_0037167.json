A confident Shah says BJP has no real challenger left as Sama-jwadi Party has knocked itself out of the reckoning by ceding 103 seats to Congress which has no presence in the state. He says the saffron party is the strong-est contender across the state. TOI's Diwakar reports ex-cerpts from a conversation with a group of reporters during electioneering on Thursday. \n\nYou have been sounding more confident after the first two phases, and have claimed that the party will do very well. \n\nThe incumbency factor which helped us in 2014 is even stronger. Moreover, BJP has grown stronger. We have extended our reach to the level of booths, while socially speaking, our inclusive approach has helped us draw in new groups. I have been touring the state since November and am confident about our performance. \n\nYou had initially identified SP-Congress alliance as your main rival. But after polling for the first two rounds, you said BSP was your competitor. \n\nI was referring to the first two phases where BSP has always been stronger than SP. \n\nSo SP-Congress alliances remains the main challenge? \n\nThey were but chief minister Akhilesh Yadav has badly hurt himself by leaving 103 seats for Congress which has no existence in the state. They are stronger than BSP in certain areas, while the latter also has pockets of strength.The issue of who is BJP's chief rival changes from one constituency to another but we remain the strongest contender across the state. \n\nPower in UP has alternated between SP and BSP over the past 14 years. Don't you think BJP is being a bit too optimistic? \n\nYou are forgetting something which happened in 2014 when BJP swept the Lok Sabha polls. I think it deserves to be taken note of too. \n\nYou have tried to polarise the electorate along communal lines \n\nWe have appealed for support on the strength of our promises which are for the betterment of all. How can you say that the promise of farm loan waiver will benefit one community and inconvenience another? \n\nYou deployed Yogi Adityanath, known for hardline views, to campaign in west UP whereas he does not even belong to the region. \n\nHe is a five-term member of Lok Sabha and a leader who has stature. Why should not he campaign? \n\nIsn't the promise to set up anti-Romeo squads a code for the party's stand against `love jihad' and hence aimed at one community? \n\nAbsolutely not. This is meant to end harassment of students by rowdies. This is a serious problem. \n\nYou say Congress has no relevance in UP . Yet, you keep attacking the party? \n\nYou have not been mild on BSP too.Our campaign is against the incumbent and SP and Congress share the slot.Congress has attracted incumbency by aligning with SP. We don't spare BSP , but the fact remains that it is the SP which is the incumbent. \n\nYou have been accused of copying the manifesto and programmes of SP? \nFor instance? \n\nTake the promise to provide 108 ambulance service \n\nFirst of all, this scheme is not unique to UP . What we have promised is to increase its frequency and reliability.We have said that we will ensure that an ambulance will reach you within 15 minutes of your call. \n\nThis is the first time after three decades that Mulayam Singh Yadav is not playing an active role in an UP election. Do you think this a prelude to realignment of political and social forces in the state? \n\nI agree that UP is on the verge of a major change in the political and social dynamics. BJP will benefit from what might unfold. \n\nDemonetisation has hurt an important section of your supporters, especially the trading community who are supposed to be sulking? \n\nIt no doubt led to inconvenience, but normalcy has been restored and there have been benefits too. It has been welcomed by a large section and will help us. And I think that the far bigger concern for our supporters is the lawlessness. As many as 13 traders have been killed since elections started. \n\nHow do you rate your prospects in other state polls? \n\nWe will win in Uttarakhand , and we will better our tally in Goa by at least five seats.There was a close triangular contest in Punjab and nothing can be said with certainty. \n\nBJP will become far more strong if the scenario painted by you comes true. There is fear that it might not be good for democracy. \n\nIt will certainly be good for the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:30:26.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
