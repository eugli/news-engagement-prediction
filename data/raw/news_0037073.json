Preliminary numbers suggest 2016 continued the trend. Wake County EMS officials answer 2 to 3 overdose related calls a day and up 10 calls per day on weekends. \nHealth officials are call the increase in overdoses an emerging public health issue and believe it's the tip of the iceberg. After listening to a presentation at a work session this afternoon, one County Commissioner compared the problem to a spreading brush fire. \nThe proposed plan includes hiring two new people â€” a nurse and Substance Use Prevention Consultant. There would also be an increase in contracted services for drug prevention and support as well. \nThe proposal would cost nearly a million dollars over the next three years. It is expected to go for a vote at the next commissioner's meeting.
