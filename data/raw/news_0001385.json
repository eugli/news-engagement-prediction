(Photo: Andy Lyons, Getty Images) \nFrom the Twitter feed of the National Park Service to the concourses of Dulles International Airport, the First Amendment has been getting quite a workout. \nResistance to divisive policy initiatives launched during the opening days of President Trump’s administration has tested the limits of how much speech the law will protect and public opinion will abide. \nNowhere is the tension greater than on the campuses of public colleges and universities, where policymakers are being called on to balance the rights of speakers against the demands of offended listeners – with the added complication of social-media platforms over which campuses may lack jurisdiction. \nTo read the national newsmagazines or listen to talk radio, you would have the impression that the greatest threat to freedom of speech on college campuses is thin-skinned “snowflakes” demanding to be bubbled off in “safe spaces.” To the contrary, by far the greatest danger to the ability of students and educators to discuss issues of public concern on college campuses is image-obsessed administrators, who increasingly regard transparency and accountability as annoyances to be minimized. \nAt West Virginia’s Fairmont State University, the last three faculty advisers to the student newspaper have been run out of their jobs under a cloud of retaliatory backlash, the last one fired in a two-sentence email after his students disclosed a toxic mold problem sickening residents of Fairmont dorms. At the University of North Carolina-Asheville, student journalists can’t get interviews with their own college’s administrators unless the public-relations office filters their questions in advance, rewriting those regarded as too “negative.” \nAt universities across the country, employees labor under (questionably legal) “gag orders” forbidding unapproved interaction with journalists. Requests for public records, if they are acknowledged at all, are routinely fulfilled months or even years late. One college president, the University of Kentucky’s Eli Capilouto, has gone to the extreme of suing the campus newspaper to conceal records disclosing how the college failed to punish an accused serial harasser; Capilouto’s attacks on student editors became so viciously unhinged that his entire journalism faculty demanded an apology, which never came. \nHow far can a university go in restraining its students from speaking, or punishing them after the fact for what they say? The law is evolving, and – because Supreme Court cases involving college speakers are so uncommon – riddled with uncertainty. \nHere is what we can say for sure. Whenever a government agency, including a state college or university, imposes consequences for the content of speech, the First Amendment is implicated.

But when consequences are government-imposed, including by way of campus discipline, they are vulnerable to constitutional challenge. Free speech, it turns out, really is free. \nIn a rare campus-speech case, the Supreme Court said in 1995 that a public university may not condition receipt of financial support on a speaker’s viewpoint (in that case, a newsmagazine at the University of Virginia that was refused funding because it promoted religion). Once the university sets up a funding mechanism, it must evaluate applicants without regard to their message – a ruling that constrains administrators today from refusing to underwrite student-organized lectures by well-known provocateurs. \nNor, the lower courts have said repeatedly, can a public institution exile speakers to remote “free-speech zones” accessible at inconvenient hours. A speaker must be given a reasonable opportunity to reach the intended audience, and any restrictions must be applied evenhandedly without discriminating against disfavored viewpoints. “Speaking permit” systems are invalid if they impose long delays or prohibitive fees, or leave administrators with open-ended discretion to play favorites. \nOutside of the campus, the First Amendment precludes restraining or punishing speech beyond a few narrow exempt categories, including realistic threats of violence and obscenity. The rest – no matter how hateful or offensive – is beyond the government’s authority to control. While this principle results in some highly distasteful speech going unregulated, including the anti-gay incoherence of Westboro Baptist Church, letting the government decide whose ideas are too extreme to be heard would produce infinitely more dangerous results. \nWhat’s important – to the surprise of many college attorneys – is no government agency may “policy” its way around the Constitution. Any state law, local ordinance or campus regulation that fails to provide at least the bare constitutional minimum of freedom is legally void and unenforceable. \nIn certain places – the workplace, prisons, K-12 schools – First Amendment rights are diminished in deference to managers’ need to keep order and get the job done. But the Supreme Court has never suggested that colleges are one of those places. To the contrary, the justices have said, the free exchange of views is central to the operation of the college “marketplace,” not a distraction from it. \nThe lack of clear judicial guidance is most acutely felt In colleges’ regulation of off-campus social-media speech, the hottest First Amendment issue confounding the courts today. \nColleges are assertively regulating online speech in ways that would never be tolerated in other media, at times throwing out students for momentary tasteless misjudgments. One such case, in which a Minnesota community-college student was expelled for calling a classmate a vulgar name on Facebook and joking about harming anyone who annoyed him by running a noisy pencil sharpener, is the subject of an impending petition for Supreme Court review. \nAt least in one area – the newsroom – the law is evolving in a favorable and speech-protective direction. \nSince 2015, North Dakota and Maryland have enacted statutes as part of the nationwide “New Voices” campaign insulating student journalists against the worst abuses of institutional censorship authority (while Illinois extended its already-existing press freedom law from colleges to high schools). Comparable bills are pending in Arizona, Indiana, Missouri, New Jersey, Vermont and Washington, and under active discussion in a handful of other states. \nNew Voices statutes restore the security that the U.S. Supreme Court took away from campus journalists in its 1988 ruling, Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier , a high-school censorship case that lower courts have – with dubious legal reasoning – applied at the college level as well. Five states – California, Illinois, Maryland, North Dakota and Oregon – now explicitly protect the rights of college journalists to choose the lawful content of student media, even media that the college financially supports. \nThese statutes shouldn’t, of course, be necessary. College administrators ardently claim to be champions of “civic engagement,” and civic engagement must always start at home – beginning with a well-informed citizenry safe in the knowledge that there will be no retaliation for questioning official doctrine or advocating to change it. \nAttorney Frank LoMonte is executive director of the Student Press Law Center, www.splc.org , a nonprofit advocate for the rights of student journalists nationwide.
