Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) won reelection to one of the most Republican districts in the nation, with 73 percent of the vote.\nOn Thursday night, he found himself facing a very different picture. Thousands of people crowded in and outside of what was supposed to be a run-of-the-mill town hall in Utah to boo him and chant, “You work for us” and “Do your job!” Reporters heard those who couldn't get into the 1,080-person auditorium yelling: “Bring him out!”\nQ's to #Chaffetz in raucous town hall: Oversight, Trump investigation, Conway, BLM, representative govt.

The common thread between then and now: One party in control of Washington undertaking a massive change to Americans' health care. When Democrats were in Republicans' situation in 2010, they lost control of Congress and haven't regained it since.\n© AP Photo/Rick Bowmer A person supporting Planned Parenthood looks on during Rep. Jason Chaffetz's town hall meeting at Brighton High School, Thursday, Feb. 9, 2017, in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. Hundreds of people lined up early for a town hall with Chaffetz on Thursday evening, many holding signs criticizing the congressman's push to repeal the newly-named Bears Ears National Monument in southern Utah. Let's back up. In 2009, Democrats had large majorities in Congress and controlled the White House. They quickly drew on their political capital to pursue one of the biggest changes to the American health-care system in decades.\nThat summer, before Obamacare became law, Democrats across the nation went home to their districts and were caught off guard by passionately angry constituents — mostly conservative — at town halls, fearful of how Obamacare might take away their rights.\nNPR recalled one particularly poignant moment that epitomized the fear and fury of these town halls:\nRep. John Dingell, a Democrat, was confronted by a man who pushed his disabled son's wheelchair up to the podium.\n“You are a fraud, and you're sentencing this person to death under the Obama plan,” the man said.\nObamacare became law without a single Republican vote. The passion helped launch the tea party and gave Republicans their biggest victories since the Great Depression.\nIn 2017, the initial script appears to be the same, only the players are flipped.\nRepublicans are fully in control of Washington for the first time in a decade, and they haven't forgotten the motivating issue for their base in 2009. Repealing Obamacare — and replacing it with something else — is their top priority. Republicans took procedural steps on their first week back in Congress this January to make that happen.\nBut in the absence of an agreed-upon plan to replace it — and the very real threat of millions of people losing their health-care coverage in the process — Republicans' confident, steady march toward health-care reform has stalled. Lawmakers themselves are anxious about how to smoothly pull out health care from millions of people and quickly slip something better in its place.\nEnter a united, fired-up left, which has taken to streets across the nation not once but twice in President Trump's first few weeks in office. These protesters didn't just come out in Washington and Los Angeles, but in Wichita, rural Virginia and Anchorage . It has all the appearance, as my colleague James Hohmann wrote recently , of the liberal answer to the tea party movement.\nThe question Republicans in Congress must ask themselves is where the parallels between 2009 and 2017 end. Are Thursday's town halls early warning signs of a historically major loss to come for Republicans in the 2018 midterms? (Not likely in the Senate, given the map is so favorable for Republicans.) Is this a movement that will give rise to new liberal leaders in a party that many believe desperately needs them? Or will moments like Thursday's events pull the Democratic Party further to the left in a way that hurts its electoral chances?\nAt the very least, Thursday's town halls are broadcasting to Republicans in Congress what most of them already know: If you're going to repeal Obamacare, you better make sure you replace it with a plan that truly is, in Trump's words, “something terrific.” Because health care has proven to be an issue that gets people into town halls and out to voting booths.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/01/22/it-wasnt-just-liberal-enclaves-womens-marches-drew-surprising-numbers-in-red-states-and-small-towns-too/", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/behind-closed-doors-republican-lawmakers-fret-about-how-to-repeal-obamacare/2017/01/27/deabdafa-e491-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html", "https://twitter.com/KyungLahCNN/status/829882606833405953", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA9UODq.img", "https://twitter.com/CourtneyLTanner/status/829873710014214144", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/Fragment/SysConfig/WebPortal/twpweb/feeds/VideoArchiver/VideosByTWPBingMRSS.jpt?section=politics&tid=msft&quot;}", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmOk8D?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmOk8D?blobrefkey=103&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1024&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;576&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/bf0e402a-", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmOk8D&lang=en-us&flow_id=de0695c5-0f13-406e-9434-01b6aa7cdb50", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Chaffetz?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/mj_lee/status/829866811097223170", "http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/08/07/209872422/4-years-after-fiery-town-halls-activists-try-to-revive-spark", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmOznd.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6Dp75.img", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/06/the-gop-is-getting-skittish-on-repealing-obamacare-right-away-which-is-probably-smart/", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/03/the-senate-map-just-cant-get-much-better-for-republicans-in-2018/", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmOk8D?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmOk8D%3focid%3dsl&title=Republican+town+halls+across+the+country+hit+by+protests&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmOk8D%3focid%3dsl", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA36Tom.img", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6Dp75.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Republican", "https://t.co/hvwpm9CnSJ", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/bf0e402a-fd89-4e43-8637-7d4e50f02fbe/64c008cc-5395-406c-beef-f076e1424582.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2017/01/23/daily-202-the-liberal-tea-party-movement-has-begun-what-will-become-of-it/58854577e9b69b432bc7e066/", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmOk8D?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmOk8D?blobrefkey=104&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1280&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;720&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp", "https://t.co/pDZsebPPeq", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Obamacare?src=hash", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/republican-town-halls-across-the-country-hit-by-protests/2017/02/10/6c739eae-efaf-11e6-a100-fdaaf400369a_video.html&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;The", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmOk8D%3focid%3dst&text=Republican+town+halls+across+the+country+hit+by+protests&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAmOk8D%3focid%3dst"], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:32:23.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
