Picture: Lindy Lawler AUSTRALIA’S youngest cystic fibrosis sufferers will this week get a massive reprieve when the government lists a life changing medication on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. \nNews Corp Australia understands Health Minister Greg Hunt will this week approve the drug Kalydeco on the PBS for 2-5 year-olds. \nThe medication will be listed from May with the government in negotiations with drug manufacturer Vertex about how to best to ease the burden on families until then. \nFamilies will only have to pay as low as $6.30 per script as opposed to $300,000 a year to access the drug. \nThe listing comes after News Corp Australia started making calls about the issue amid increasing pressure on the government from sufferers and the federal opposition. \nIt will mean the nation’s littlest sufferers of the life-shortening chronic illness will have a shot at a normal life with the drug one of the first in the world to address the underlying causes of CF rather than simply its symptoms. \nSufferers will go from taking 60 to 80 tablets a day in the worst circumstances, to as few as 10 tablets a day. \nHowever, more than 1000 Australians over the age of 12 with a different mutation of the illness will still be left waiting for their shot at a normal life with the drug Orkambi yet to be listed on the PBS. \nCystic Fibrosis is the most common, genetically acquired, life-shortening chronic illness affecting young Australians. \nThose with the illness develop an abnormal amount of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs and digestive system, trapping bacteria and leading to infections which result in irreversible damage. \nThere is no cure and sufferers get progressively worse from birth. The average age of deaths from CF is 28. \nMichele Adair, CF Australia spokesperson and CEO of CFNSW said listing Kalydeco on the PBS for 2-5 year-olds would be a “game-changer”. \nThe medication is currently listed for kids from the age of six, however often by that stage irreversible damage has already occurred, shaving years off their lives. \n“Often people with cystic fibrosis have to take between 60 to 80 tablets a day, they spend an hour or more inhaling up to four different antibiotics or other treatments and up to two hours a day in physio,” Ms Adair told News Corp Australia. \n“These drugs (Kalydeco and Orkambi) completely change that. As well as having significant health benefits they also result in fewer hospitalisations which reduces the cost burden for all. \n“There are just no words for how much this would help CF sufferers.” \nCurrently patients who need Orkambi either have to take part in a clinical trial or pay $260,000 a year for access to the drug. \nOpposition health spokeswoman Catherine King said Labor was prepared to work with the government to do whatever it could to help alleviate the financial burden for sufferers and get them the lifesaving drugs they needed. \n“I can only imagine the distress of families in this situation,” Ms King said. \n“That’s why Labor is prepared to work with the Government in any way we can on this issue. As a priority we urge the government to work with the manufacturer and resolve outstanding issues as soon as possible.” \nOlivia Wood, 17, is just about to start her HSC but battles daily with cystic fibrosis. \nThe Sydney teen attends hospital for 2-3 week stints at least four times a year to manage her illness. \nShe takes more than 30 tablets a day and has done since a toddler. \n“Mum used to have to put them in apple sauce as that was the only way I would eat them,” Ms Wood told News Corp Australia. \nHaving access to Orkambi would more than halve the number of tablets Ms Wood takes each day and would allow her to achieve her dreams of working as a chef or in hospitality. Her life would be full and long. \n“Having this drug would mean not coming into hospital as often and I could actually enjoy my life,” she said. \nFamilies and CF sufferers will on Tuesday travel to Canberra for a planned rally to highlight the need for Orkambi to be listed on the PBS. \nCaron David, 39, told News Corp Australia she cries every day for her son Jude, 2. \nThe central coast mother and her husband Matthew, 41, had their lives ripped apart when at just five-weeks-old Jude was confirmed to have cystic fibrosis. \nAfter six years of IVF, Jude was their little miracle. \nMs David said she would do anything to alleviate his suffering. \nJude has to have physio three times a day, take oral vitamins and dozens of pills a week. \n“Having Kalydeco on the PBS will give my son a shot at a normal life,” she said. \n“It will allow him to get a job, to fall in love and do all the normal things to have a full and happy life. \n“This is an investment in our future. Putting this drug on the PBS is not a cost with no return. It will allow those who benefit from it to be productive members of society. My son won’t be a strain on the government or hospital system, he’ll be able to work and contribute.” More Local News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T20:03:43.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
