Bravery presides in staying in the party and trying to change the party, not running away because you can't handle the heat of the kitchen.\" \nOuch. \nSenator Bernardi has what we might call a robust sense of self but he's receiving a crash course in how fast friendships can end. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Lucy Turnbull and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce during a church service on Tuesday morning. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen 8:50am \nI was going to say no one mention the word 'rat' but it's stacks on Senator Bernardi . \nHere's a flavour of some of the things his soon-to-be-former party colleagues are saying about him. \nTrade Minister Steve Ciobo : \"He's never laid a glove on the Labor Party.\" \nDefence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne : \" Cory Bernardi was elected as a Liberal. The honourable course is for him to resign his seat and for him to recontest it as an independent.\" \nImmigration Minister Peter Dutton : \"It is a betrayal when someone leaves....People will be angry and they will be disappointed. I think people will be angry about any defection, angry about the betrayal of the Liberal Party values.\" 8:45am \nIt's hard to keep up, isn't it? \nWe've barely recovered (if we ever did) from the saga of the most talked about phone call since Prince Charles declared his ambition to be a tampon. \nNow we've got Cory Bernardi to leave the Liberal Party and stay on in the Senate as an independent. 8:42am \nGood morning and welcome to the day, indeed the year, in politics. \nAlex Ellinghausen, Andrew Meares and I are here to keep you company. \nHappy new year and thanks for joining us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:12:11.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
