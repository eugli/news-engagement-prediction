Trump’s decision to break with tradition and skip the politico-press schmoozefest comes after a number of big-league news organizations have yanked their usual parties. Bloomberg L.P., Vanity Fair and The New Yorker ditched the glitzy affairs they usually stage. And yesterday, the WHCA issued a statement “protesting strongly” against the White House’s exclusion of CNN, The New York Times, Politico and other prominent news organizations from a Sean Spicer press gaggle. “We encourage the organizations that were allowed in to share the material with others in the press corps who were not,” the statement read. “The board will be discussing this further with White House staff.” Also as of yesterday, the WHCA was going ahead with the annual dinner, set for April 29 at the Hinckley Hilton in D.C. I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 The crumbling of the usually good-natured event comes as the president continues ramping up his battle with the press, calling “fake news” the “enemy” of the American people and condemning the use of anonymous sources. The press wasted no time pointing out that Trump’s administration routinely offers journalists not-for-attribution info, and that the new president’s old demands for Barack Obama’s birth certificate were fueled by his standard “people are saying” sourcing.
