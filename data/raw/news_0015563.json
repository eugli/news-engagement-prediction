Run the ball, Kyle Shanahan. Run on first, run on second, run on third. Kick field goal. Hoist Lombardi Trophy. \n2. Coin flips should decide lunch, not world championships. \n3. Give Tom Brady enough time, and he could beat the tax code. \n4. Because of No. 3, the Cowboys need to find a pass rush if they want to win one of these things again. \nFollowing up on the last point, this seems like a pretty good time to kick the tires on a Cowboys legend, see what he has left and whether he wants to finish where he started. 5 things Cowboys need to make Super Bowl 52, like getting big year out of potential steal of 2016 draft \nDeMarcus Ware, an unrestricted free agent in March, declared last week he's good to go for another season. And not just in a ceremonial sense, either. This was breaking news, given that he appeared done with a bad back at 34. In this market, we're more or less experts on football players with those particular measurables. \nWare played in only 10 games for the Broncos and recorded four sacks, both career lows. Of course, a little perspective is in order. For instance, the Cowboys basically employed five defensive ends this season. Only two, Tyrone Crawford and Benson Mayowa, had more sacks than Ware. Lawrence needed 14 games to get his 4.5, and Mayowa got his six in 13. \nThe bar for defensive ends around here has been set so low lately, you'd think they were playing limbo instead. \nAnyway, the reason Ware gives for wanting to play at least one more season is that, after surgery for a ruptured disk in December, he says he feels better than he has since 2014, when he had 10 sacks in his Denver debut. \nNow, I know what you're thinking: Ware was 32 then, he benefited greatly from playing opposite Von Miller ... and didn't you say the Cowboys were right to tell him goodbye ? \nCorrect on all three counts. Let me explain. \nWhen Jerry Jones let Ware go to the Broncos for three years and $30 million after the 2013 season, the Cowboys' salary cap was a mess. They were also coming off their third consecutive 8-8 season. A team treading water didn't need to spend big on a 30ish defensive end on the decline. \nAs it turned out, the Cowboys proved to be better than anyone projected in 2014. They could have used Ware at Lambeau. In fact, Dez's catch-or-no-catch debate might have been rendered moot. Three lessons the Cowboys can take from the Super Bowl into next season \nComing off another surprising season, the Cowboys are in much the same position that they were after 2014. Still looking for a pass rush with few viable options. \nWare would make sense for the Cowboys if he'd play for roughly the same $6.5 million he received from the Broncos after restructuring his deal last season. Naturally, it depends on if he passes a physical first. \nSigning a healthy Ware wouldn't preclude the Cowboys from drafting a pass rusher or two. They need talent and numbers. But let's face it: You're probably not going to find another Myles Garrett with the 28th pick. \nWhat you're more likely to get is another Emmanuel Ogbah. \nMaybe you recall that the Cowboys were set to take the defensive end from Oklahoma State high in the second round when the Browns intervened. In 16 games, Ogbah had 5.5 sacks. Which was pretty good for a rookie end. Generally speaking, only the best of the best make a big splash in their first season. \nIf Ware's back feels better than it has in 18 months, as he contends, and he remains healthy, I'd bet he makes a run at double-digit sacks. He'd give the Cowboys a presence they haven't had since he left, and he'd be a priceless mentor for all the young ends on the roster. Cowboys tied for second in best odds of winning Super Bowl 52; Patriots top team \nFrankly, the only problem I can envision is if the Broncos decide to bring him back and he'd rather remain paired up with Miller. \nOtherwise, Jerry, do your due diligence and see what it would take to get it done. The Cowboys are trending up, but they won't go deep in the playoffs without a pass rush. Especially against the likes of Brady. He looked pretty pedestrian when Atlanta pressured him early. But when the Falcons' defense ran out of gas, and he had time, Brady did what Brady does. \nOn a related note, my personal favorite Super Bowl commercial was the one from Ford about getting stuck. Can't say for sure, but the kid hanging upside down from the fence could have been one of mine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:31:53.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
