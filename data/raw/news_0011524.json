(Photo: Rob Schumacher/azcentral sports) \nPhil Mickelson always will be the fan favorite at the Waste Management Phoenix Open but fellow Arizona State Sun Devil Jon Rahm is giving him a run for the crowd’s affection. \nOn the par-3 16th hole Rahm threw on an Arizona State No. 42 Pat Tillman jersey with “Rahmbo” stitched on the back. He drew a roar, although it was a bit more subdued than usual because his featured threesome that included Jordan Spieth and Ricky Fowler teed off at 7:57 a.m. on the back nine. \nMORE: Phoenix Open section | Leaderboard \n“That’s one of my nicknames. It’s the first one that comes up for sure,” Rahm said after shooting a “pretty solid” 1-under 70. “I did it two years ago and enjoyed it. Today was a little early for anybody to be there but I’m pretty sure (Friday) will be a little louder.” Wearing a jersey. — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) February 2, 2017 \nRahm’s round included an all-world par on the 470-yard par-4 fifth hole. His drive stayed left and hit a water bottle that a fan had in his pocket. From the rough, Rahm’s second shot plugged into the bunker short of the green. \n• Phoenix Open fan guide | Bird's Nest concert guide | Transportation tips \nNo problem. He barely cleared the lip with his bunker shot and the ball rolled into tap-in range for the par. \n“I didn’t know I hit a fan,” Rahm said. “Nobody told me. That bunker shot wasn’t easy but all I needed to do was get it up on the front of the green. If I could fly it there I knew the ball would release.” \nIt’s the sort of par Mickelson has made throughout his career. Must be something about maroon and gold. Facebook Posted!
