He had decades of flying experience and an \"impeccable safety record\", according to the website of charter company Corporate and Leisure Aviation, which he owned with his wife. \nEssendon Airport, mostly used by light planes, is about 13km (8 miles) north-west of central Melbourne. \nIt has been closed, but the city's main hubs for commercial air traffic - Melbourne Airport and Avalon Airport - remain open. \nChaotic aftermath \nThe crash sent black smoke high into the air and ignited a blaze that required more than 60 firefighters to bring under control. \nPolice shut the adjacent Tullamarine Freeway after witnesses spotted debris from the plane including a wheel on the road. The area around the shops was evacuated, and three nearby schools were closed. \nVideo showed thick smoke and fire at the wreckage scene. \n\"Immediately I could tell it was something horrific, the explosion would have gone 30m [100ft] high and ballooned upwards in red and black,\" witness Mikey Cahill told the Herald Sun. \nAnother witness, Daniel May, said he was waiting for the shopping centre to open when the plane came down. \n\"There was an orange explosion and then smoke,\" he told The Age. \"Emergency crews rushed very quickly in, soon after, and I left the area.\" \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he was \"deeply saddened\" as he offered condolences to the families of the victims. \nKing Island, popular for its beaches and dairy farms, lies 245km (150 miles) south of Melbourne in Bass Strait. \nPublished: 21-02-2017 12:23 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:50:38.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
