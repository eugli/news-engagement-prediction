And homeless, if it was not for ACA…. What kind of insurance do you have?”\n\"If you can give us better care than this, go for it,\" she told the senator to huge cheers.\nA woman opened by stating \"I'm not a paid protester,\" referencing unsubstantiated claims made by the US president and repeated by White House press secretary Sean Spicer.\nProfessional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\n— Donald J.
