Last year, the audience dropped to 111.9 for Panthers-Broncos. \nThe fact that the latest Super Bowl, which generated zero points in the first quarter, a whiff of a blowout in the second quarter, and a 28-3 margin in quarter three, dropped only 600,000 from Super Bowl 50 is impressive â€” especially in light of the doom and gloom (#boomandgloom) generated by the ratings throughout the 2016 season.
