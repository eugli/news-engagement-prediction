MONIQUE STEELE/FAIRFAX NZ \nChristchurch landscape architect Jay van Lent beside his aerial map of the \"cross of the CBD\" - the intersection of Colombo and Worcester streets, centred by the Christ Church Cathedral. \nIn Van Lent's New Regent St office hangs a two-metre cross, an aerial view of Colombo and Worcester streets with Christ Church Cathedral in the centre. \nAbout 400 pink cherry blossom trees line the streets in his plans, creating an archway of pink blossoms at street level, which Van Lent says will revitalise the CBD. SUPPLIED \nArko landscape architect Jay van Lent's \"cross of the CBD\", which he dreams of lining with cherry blossoms. \n\"It's something that would create such a character and history for the city,\" he said. \n\"I think it would pull at the heart strings.\" \nHe said he was unmotivated by any religious meanings of the cross, but bringing trees into the city made it the perfect place for a farmers' market. A year-round market around the Cathedral could be a \"draw card for tourism\" in the city. MONIQUE STEELE/FAIRFAX NZ \nLandscape architect Jay Van Lent dreams of turning Oxford Tce into the heart of the Avon River, adding flower beds and a wishing well. \n\"Tourists come here and want to see that. This would be a great way for us to celebrate the city. Ad Feedback \n\"It's going to help bring our community together.\" \nAccording to a quote from a Christchurch arborist company, it would cost about $400,000 for 400 trees to be transplanted, which Van Lent said was affordable in comparison to concrete costs. \n\"For within $1 million, you have a cherry blossom cross throughout the city,\" he said. \nFrom his experience as a landscape architect, Christchurch residents wanted more trees and less concrete structures, especially in the city centre, he said. \nHe said Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel stopped by his office to see the cross design. \n\"Lianne loved it . . . she wants trees in the city.\" \nChristchurch City Council head of parks Andrew Rutledge said the council was yet to commence planning for the revitalisation of Cathedral Square. \n\"The council hasn't formally called for design ideas. . . . This plan is one person's vision of how they would like to see the city revitalised.\" \nHe said it was too early to comment on the possible cost of the project. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:01:22.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
