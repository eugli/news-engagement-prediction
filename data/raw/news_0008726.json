Acquired by New York’s Madison Capital in 2015 as part of a four-building deal reportedly worth $27 million, both 936 and 939 W. Fulton Market have been granted permits for renovations penned by Chicago-based Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture and contracted to LG Construction. Work was first cleared to begin at 936 W. Fulton Market in December of last year. The ornate, two-story former meatpacking building known as the old Fulton Central Market Building will receive a gut rehab to accommodate new retail and office use and see the addition of an elevator system.

Fulton landed a permit this week for interior demolition and the replacement of damaged structural floors, columns, and framing members. According to renderings of the completed project, a vertical expansion and the addition of a rooftop terrace also appear to be in the cards. 393 W. Fulton Google Street View Madison Capital/HPA Some Chicagoans may lament the neighborhood’s recent mass exodus of food wholesalers, but seeing these old buildings take on new life is a far more thoughtful alternative than demolition. While brand new construction is certainly playing a big role in the renaissance of Fulton Market, adaptive reuse projects—like Google’s 1K Fulton and the Soho House hotel and club—have been equally important catalysts in making the area such a desirable place to work, dine, and live.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:07:14.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
