Vivaldi’s orchestra is comparatively huge and varied — four theorbos! proto-clarinet-ish chalumeaux! — and deployed in ways that may lack Monteverdi’s emotional sophistication but allow for kaleidoscopic effects and more modern verve. The vocalism is here more athletically florid than declamatory, little problem for the fiery mezzo Ann Hallenberg, like Ms. Mingardo unaccountably obscure in America, and her cast mates. \nAdvertisement   As my colleague Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim wrote as the festival began , it was impossible to avoid the whiff of politics throughout “La Serenissima.” Trade and internationalism made Venice’s economic success and culture possible; one of the greatest of all operatic depictions of power, “Poppea” makes us meditate, as the scholar Ellen Rosand has written, on “its extraordinary glorification of lust and ambition at the expense of reason and morality.” These dips into Baroque Venice were delightful, but they were no escape from our time.

Three years after the events of the final scene, which gloriously depicts Poppea’s coronation and marriage to Nero in A.D. 62, Nero kicked Poppea in the stomach in a fit of rage, killing her. “Poppea” was performed by Concerto Italiano on Tuesday. In the weeks before, the festival threw another beautiful if unflattering light on the same historical period, Handel’s early opera “Agrippina,” presented, both in concert and in an overwrought staged production, by forces of the Juilliard School. “Agrippina” takes the story back some years, to Nero’s first marriage — in A.D. 53, to Emperor Claudius’s daughter Octavia, at the age of 17 — and his ascension to the imperial throne on Claudius’s death the next year. Here the cynicism and ugly politicking are impossible to ignore even for a moment, as Agrippina, wife of Claudius and mother of Nero, plots to place her son (Claudius’s stepson) on the throne, while much of male Rome, it seems, including Claudius, tries to bed Poppea. The “Poppea” performance, with Rinaldo Alessandrini leading his little band of period instrumentalists and an excellent cast of singers led by Miah Persson and Sara Mingardo, was a fitting conclusion to a festival that must surely be counted a success in musical terms. It seems also to have consistently drawn sizable audiences, though “Poppea,” with its decidedly minimal staging touches, lost many listeners after intermission. Ah, but what they missed at the end!

Credit Ian Douglas for The New York Times A Virtual Handshake Midway through its concert of love scenes from Venetian opera on Feb. 14, the period-instrument ensemble Il Pomo d’Oro performed an instrumental sonata by the 17th-century composer Dario Castello. On one note the first violinist enacted a sort of extravagant, slowed-down vibrato that resulted in a quarter-tone wobble. The gesture injected a hint of Middle Eastern flavor into the music, momentarily troubling the early-Baroque harmonies in a way that was both beautiful and alienating. Three days later, sitting in the same seat at Zankel Hall for the Ahmet Erdogdular Classical Turkish Music Ensemble, I felt a jolt of déjà vu during an improvised kamancheh solo in a Sufi hymn. The bowed, almond-shaped kamancheh looks a bit like a violin, but is held upright on the player’s knee and produces a sandier, more veiled sound that can be uncannily like a female voice, husky with grief. That vocal quality came through strongly in Derya Turkan ’s soulful improvisation — which included the same languid oscillation of pitch that had struck me as so oddly expressive in the Pomo d’Oro concert. There were no program notes at either event belaboring the point that Venice owed much of its cultural riches to its deep engagement with the Ottoman Empire. But by presenting both excellent ensembles side by side as part of its festival, Carnegie Hall subtly orchestrated this virtual handshake across cultures, genres and time.
