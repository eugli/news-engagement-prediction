Source: Getty Images \n— The illegal shot in the first round changed the fight. When Mundine rewatches the opening minute of the bout he’ll see a tentative and slightly-overwhelmed looking fighter. He may have just been settling into a rhythm but there was reason to believe this fight was going down a similar path to his bouts with Joshua Clottey and Charles Hatley from what we saw in the opening exchanges. It wasn’t until Mundine saw Green concussed he gained confidence. \n— Mundine stopped us from feeling true outrage at the decision because of the advantage he gained through illegal means. Regardless of how Green responded in the following rounds, that shot concussed him — and had a huge bearing on how he fought the rest of the way. Mundine will argue Green should have been protecting himself, but the shot was ruled a foul by the referee, which means it wasn’t fair and should be treated as such. It’s hard to feel sorry for someone who cheated. \n— Labelling Green a “bitch” was classless and inaccurate. Sure Green held at times. That’s boxing. The question Mundine needs to ask is, if he was hit with the illegal shot he landed on Green in the first round, would he have kept fighting? Or would he have taken the default win, cashed his cheque and got out of there? \n— He still has a lot left in the tank. The Mundine we saw in rounds eight, nine and 10 wasn’t peak Choc, but it was close enough to warrant The Man extending his career for another fight or two. There may not be an obvious, pay-per-view selling opponent (outside of a trilogy fight with Green) but I want to see Mundine fight again. There’s still no one else in Australia with his level of talent so let’s see it one or two more times. \nWHAT GREEN MUST ACCEPT Danny Green. Source: AAP \n— The scorecards fell in his favour. The 98-90 scoreline handed in by one judge was a disgrace. That judge gave Green every round outside the one he landed an illegal shot. What a joke. There’s no way an impartial observer can argue Green had the upperhand in nine of the 10 rounds, especially late in the fight. The other two cards were defensible (particularly the judge who scored it 94-94), but there was also another blooper which went largely unnoticed. The judge who scored the fight 96-94 in Green’s favour shockingly produced a 10-10 score for the seventh round. Both of the other judges scored it 10-8 Mundine after Green was docked a point for an illegal shot. If the third had followed suit his card would have finished 94-94 — and we would have had a majority draw. \n— Mundine is a better boxer. Green has a case to argue he’s on Mundine’s level as an overall fighter (given his truly admirable levels of determination, courage and heart) but as a technician he’s not close to The Man’s level. That’s been proven across the two fights where Mundine’s superior skill level, movement and speed has been clear for all to see. \n— He’s done. As stressed above, the illegal shot in the first round clearly affected Green’s performance. It’s hard to know exactly how much it contributed to his sluggishness and lack of energy in the later rounds, but it was clear how little Green had left in the tank from rounds eight to 10. Given how difficult it was for him to even get through his training camp, Green should give it away. He’s been a champion of the sport in this country and doesn’t need to put his body — or his family — through any more stress. \nWHAT WE MUST ACCEPT Mundine and Green share a touching moment. Source: News Corp Australia \n— They’re both really good blokes. As much as we’re asked to pick sides in a rivalry like this, the truth is by both men are worthy of our admiration. Green is impossible to dislike — just an absolute true blue Aussie champion. Mundine, despite the character he plays to sell fights, is also an exceptional role model for indigenous youth. If this proves to be their final fight, let’s celebrate both of them. \n— We cared. All the pre-fight talk arguing there was no one interested in this match-up was so, so wrong. Traffic on this website was through the roof. Close to 150,000 people tuned into an illegal stream of the fight. Everyone I ran into over the course of the weekend wanted to talk about it. This was one of the biggest sporting events in this country for the year. Without question. \n— Boxing will frustrate the hell out of you. This isn’t a sport with the checks and balances of a competition like the AFL or NRL. Dodgy things happen all the time. Horrible scorecards are delivered every year. Is it wrong? Yes. Does it add to the fun of following the sport? Certainly. A little controversy never hurt anyone and boxing delivers it in spades. \n— A trilogy fight is probably coming. Green attempted to set a classy tone to the post-fight talk from both fighters but it didn’t last long as Mundine questioned the decision — and The Green Machine couldn’t resist firing back. That may just be the emotion pouring out, but I suspect it’s to begin testing interest in a decider. Neither man may need the money, but it’s going to be hard to say no to another Godfather offer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:11:21.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
