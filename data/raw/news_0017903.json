Cahill sent in derby meltdown 1:18 \n“I want to address what happened in the Derby on Saturday night,” Cahill wrote. “I sincerely apologise to Chris Beath for my reaction. \n“My behaviour also hurt the game so I also apologise to my team, to Melbourne Victory and to all the fans at the game and watching at home. \n“Regardless of whatever happens on the pitch, I have to respect the game and the officials. I want the game to grow in Australia and I want to do all I can to help that happen. No matter the situation, I have to set an example and be accountable for my words and actions. \n“My job now is to focus totally on football and winning as many games as possible.” A photo posted by Tim Cahill (@tim_cahill) on Feb 6, 2017 at 12:43am PST View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
