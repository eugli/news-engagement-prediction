And with some of the most beautiful hikes in the world in our own backyard, there’s no excuse not to lace up and get out there. \nHere are six trails you’ll just have to see to believe. Trust us: You won’t regret a minute of it. Kalalau Trail, Kauai, Hawaii \nKalalau Trail, Kauai, Hawaii.

Hoh-High Divide Traverse, Washington \nA deer grazes in Olympic National Park.

Nowhere feels more like fantasy than Olympic National Park. \nThis tough traverse has it all, from colorful meadows to craggy summits. Pick a short piece of the 45-mile trek and spend a day getting lost (metaphorically speaking, of course) in this Pacific Northwest wonderland. Precipice Trail, Maine \nA rung-and-ladder section of Acadia’s Precipice Trail. Photo: Courtesy of Dan Palowski Photography Want to really get your heart racing? Then this is the hike for you. \nLadders, iron rungs and slippery boulders are the only way to get up this 1,000-foot climb. At the top, try and calm your nerves with sweeping views of the ocean and Acadia National Park . Redwood Creek Trail, California \nGet lost (figuratively) in the redwoods of California.

Rhododendron Trail, Virginia \nPonies graze in the shadow of Rhododendron Trail in Virginia. Photo: Courtesy of Michael Speed Climbing up to the highest point in Virginia, Mt. Rogers (5,729 feet), this round-trip trail winds through emerald forests, an exposed mountain bald and, if you’re lucky, a herd of wild ponies. \nBonus points if you can make it back here in June, when the trail’s namesake flower is in full bloom. The Jewels Route, Arizona \nA view of the Grand Canyon. Photo: Courtesy of Eds_Photos/ Twenty20 The Grand Canyon is just one of those places you have to see for yourself, and this less heavily traveled Jewels Route is the way to do it if you want to explore the canyon without the crowds. \nLocated at the western end of the National Park, it’s a 48-mile trek, but just a few miles in and you’ll be treated to deep-orange rocks, turquoise Colorado River views and a little peace and quiet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T17:05:09.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
