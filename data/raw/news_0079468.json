Gone are modular phones and leather backs: instead, the LG G6 is a stylish and durable phone with a trendy glass body and a metal frame. It's also the first of an upcoming wave of futuristic-looking 'full-screen' phones with tiny bezels. There is a ton of new features about the LG G6, but a lot of them center around the new 5.7-inch display that is now taller and narrower. The new LG G6 display also supports two wider color standards: Dolby Vision and HDR 10. The terms actually come from the TV world and while we've had HDR display phones, the LG G6 is the first with support for Dolby Vision which brings out more colors, better contrast and dynamic scene optimization in video. You can find a few Netflix and Amazon Video productions supporting this new standard, and more content will be coming in the near future. \nLG G6 new interface The LG G6 now features a brand new user interface (UI) that takes advantage of the new 18:9 aspect ratio. You can see more information on the screen, and interestingly, the new interface is rounded around the edges.
