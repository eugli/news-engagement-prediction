Photo: Brendan Esposito \nSome residents, though, will take some convincing, with the Northwest Alliance raising concerns about potential impact on the Great Australian Basin as well as the prospect of other future CSG projects. \n\"We know that CSG in the Pilliga is a trojan horse to access vast areas of agricultural country in north-west NSW,\" Megan Kuhn, a grazier on the Liverpool Plains, said. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Waste disposal from the proposed CSG projection - including up 115 tonnes of salt per day - is one issue likely to be examined closely. Photo: Rob Homer \n\"Santos has announced plans for seven major gasfields across our productive farming region. They want to replicate the Queensland [CSG] disaster on us but clearly lack a social licence, which is necessary for them to begin.\" \nAmong the environmental issues is salt, which will peak at 115 tonnes a day during the second to fourth years of the project, and average 47 tonnes daily over 25 years, Santos said. \n\"The salt would be managed by off-site disposal to an appropriately licensed facility,\" the company said. \nStuart Khan, an associate engineering professor at the University of NSW, said Santos had previously stated dumping the salt into landfills was a last resort as it hunted commercially viable \"beneficial reuse\" for the salt, from glassmaking to sodium bicarbonate production. \n\"But here we are proposing to landfill 430,000 tonnes of salt over the life of the project,\" Professor Khan said. \n\"Landfills will be lined with synthetic liners to prevent leakage to groundwater, but all synthetic liners have a lifespan and they will all fail over a period of time,\" he said. \"In time, it is certain that someone will need to come along and clean up these legacy salt landfills in order to prevent environmental damage.\" \nFairfax Media sought comment from Planning Minister Anthony Roberts about an extension of the consultation. Labor said it remains opposed to the Narrabri project and supports the longer exhibition period. \n\"The community has been battling coal seam gas for many years now and attitudes have only hardened against it,\" Jeremy Buckingham, the Greens energy spokesman, said. \n\"We've seen spills of toxic water kill large swathes of forest, the pollution of an aquifer with uranium, and leaking infrastructure from only a few gas wells in the exploration phase of this project,\" he said. \n\"If this project is approved, it will multiply this damage and risk with 850 gas wells, associated pipelines, powerlines, compressor stations and water treatment plants.\" Separately, the NSW government on Tuesday appointed the state's chief scientist Mary O'Kane as chair of its new Energy Security Taskforce to examine how to improve management of extreme weather impacts on the state's infrastructure. This taskforce follows a record heatwave earlier this month that strained the state's electricity sector.
