Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nMost notably, the new federal building code outlaws a litany of union-friendly clauses â€“ such as union consultation provisions, restrictions on the use of labour hire staff, and requirements for non-working site delegates \nThe Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union said workers would launch rallies and work stoppages that would bring the industry to a halt. \n\"Right across Australia, the industry will stop and workers will go to rallies and they will say, 'Enough is enough',\" Mr Noonan said. \nThe Electrical Trades Union on Thursday blasted the government and the Senate crossbench, saying the new code made it harder for unions to enforce safety standards and preventing contractors from undercutting pay and conditions \nUnion secretary Allen Hicks said the legislation would \"sow the seeds of industrial chaos and endanger lives\". \nMaster Builders Australia chief executive Wilhelm Harnisch praised the Turnbull government and crossbench Senators for backing the bill. \n\"They have voted yes to the rule of law and no to union bullying on building sites. They have voted yes to supporting small business sub-contractors and no to intimidation and thuggery. They have voted yes to ensuring taxpayers get value for money and no to delay and cost blow-outs,\" said. \n\"After three royal commissions, dozens of reviews and inquiries, and countless court decisions, it is clear that the construction industry had unique problems and that tougher industry specific rules were needed.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:04:10.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
