Um, been a very difficult time,\" he said. \nAsked about his fans, Hackett said \"I've had awesome support and can't thank them enough\". \n\"Absolutely blown away by that to be honest,\" he said. \nIn a statement, Hackett called the period since his arrest \"the toughest week of my life\". \nHe also thanked his parents and said he had resolved his differences with his brother Craig, who he criticised for speaking to media after his arrest. \n\"They have been amazing and have now stood by me through thick and thin - I can't say enough about them - I could not wish for better parents,\" he wrote. \nA day after his arrest, Hackett shared an Instagram picture of himself sporting a black eye and bloody face and wrote that his brother had \"beat the s--- out of me\" during a dispute last month. \n\"My brother and I have reconnected and love each other very much - our family has always been our priority,\" Hackett said in his statement. \nHackett went into hiding last Thursday, prompting his father Neville to make a missing person report, and has since pleaded for privacy as he begins seeking help for his issues. \n\"This is a very private matter that I am going through and I am going to work my way through it,\" he said. \n\"I would appreciate it if everyone would allow me and my family to do everything we need to do.\" \nWith AAP.
