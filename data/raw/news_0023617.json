Education Minister John Swinney with Nicola Sturgeon Credit: PA \nN icola Sturgeon has said she wants to be judged by her success in closing the “attainment gap” between the poorest and wealthiest pupils and Scottish Labour said the SNP “should be ashamed of these figures.” \nIain Gray, the party’s education spokesman, said: “Nicola Sturgeon said education would be the defining priority of her government; she put her top minister in charge of it and has announced a stream of schemes but the gap between the richest and the poorest most able pupils is more than two and a half years. \n“In Scotland today how much money you have means that, even for the ablest pupils, they can be two and a half years behind the richest pupils in key subjects like maths and science. That is a scandal and a ticking timebomb for our economy.” \nThe study said it compared the PISA test scores of clever children with parents working in occupations such as managers, doctors and lawyers with those whose mothers and fathers work in relatively unskilled jobs like cleaners and waiters. \nIt found that the performance of bright Scottish pupils had suffered a sharp decline at science since 2006 and this was driven by lower scores recorded by those from the wealthiest backgrounds. \nScotland’s performance was “broadly comparable” to England’s in 2006 but the cleverest 10 per cent Scottish children are now significantly behind their English peers. \nAlthough the research found a sharp drop in the difference in reading performance between clever Scottish children from wealthy and poor backgrounds, it again said this was thanks to a large drop in the scores of the rich youngsters rather deprived youngsters doing better. \nA Scottish Government spokesman said: “ We welcome this research. It adds to our understanding of some of the challenges we want to address in our determination to close the attainment gap over the next ten years. \n“This government is already taking action to ensure that every child, no matter their background, has the chance to succeed by implementing a range of measures to strengthen our education system and to give every child an equal chance of going to university.” Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:09:54.321+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
