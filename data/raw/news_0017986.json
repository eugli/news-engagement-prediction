So his choice of outfit for Friday night's Knicks-Nuggets game at the Garden was an easy one. \nThe recent events involving Charles Oakley only made his decision more impactful. \nZuckerberg, a lifelong Knicks fan born in Brooklyn, wore a No. 34 Oakley jersey to the arena that he bought two decades ago. He attended the game with his father, Richard, and his son, Nathaniel. And he didn't shy away from telling the News exactly how he felt about the Knicks banning Oakley from the Garden indefinitely , a decision owner James Dolan announced earlier Friday afternoon on ESPN Radio. \n\"Charles Oakley was the heart and soul of that Knicks team during the 80s and 90s,\" Zuckerberg said about 30 minutes before tip. \"Hardest working Knick ever, so he deserves all the respect of the fans and the organization. And Jim Dolan has nothing but a losing record. So if we're going to put Charles Oakley in one column against Jim Dolan, every time I'm pulling for Charles Oakley. He's 10 times the man Jim Dolan will ever be. So I'm with Oak.\" Wicked Garden: A look at the worst moments in the history of Madison Square Garden \n\"Dolan is a complete d bag. I absolutely believe that,\" Zuckerberg continued. \"He's just a terrible human being and he's a horrible owner. The record speaks for itself. He doesn't know anything about basketball. Charles Oakley earned the respect that he's got. What has Dolan earned? He hasn't earned anything. He's got money. That's all he's got. He didn't earn that either.\" \nOakley was forcibly removed from the Garden Wednesday night. He claims Dolan ordered his removal. Dolan refuted that notion and is adamant Oakley was acting in an \"abusive manner.\" Oakley was arrested and charged with three counts of assault and one count of criminal trespass. \nThe details of the incident aren't important to Richard Zuckerberg, though. \n\"I don't really care about that, because nobody really knows what happened,\" he said. \"I feel about Charles Oakley that way the cops feel when one of their guys does something that might be wrong. It doesn't matter to them, because there's a band of brothers, a whole brotherhood thing. \nCharles Oakley rep: Knicks owner's accusations are 'insulting' \n\"I think all Knicks fans remember Charles Oakley and what he did for that team, what he represented for New York City and for the Knicks. We're passionate about our teams. It's the Giants, the Yankees, the Mets, the Knicks. We love our f---ing teams. And Oakley was a guy who represented us the way we wanted to be seen. Dolan is not the guy who represents the Knicks as far as I'm concerned. And I stick up for Oakley because he's the spirit of the Knicks. His number ought to be up there.\" \nRichard Zuckerberg then pointed to the rafters. \nFans were mostly subdued during the early stages of Friday night's game. A couple 15-second-long \"WE WANT OAKLEY!\" chants broke out in the first quarter. But each time the chants grew, the Knicks played music over the loud speaker to dull the voices. Richard (left) and Josh Zuckerberg, like many Knicks fans, are taking Charles Oakley's side. \nNonetheless, the feeling among fans was palpable. \n\"It's disrespectful. It was absolutely terrible,\" said Joey Putignano, a Knicks fan from Hackettstown, New Jersey. \"Seeing him getting dragged out of the arena, it's like rock bottom. It's pathetic.\" Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:48:28.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
