Terry Sanford set Taryn Mecia on a path to law school and ultimately establishing a legal department for one of Charlotte’s venerable homegrown retailers. A Charlotte native and graduate of West Charlotte High School, Mecia developed an interest in real estate while in law school, and after graduation she worked with Kennedy Covington as a real estate associate, providing legal guidance to developers on significant Charlotte projects. Taryn Mecia, Harris Teeter Melissa Key In 2004, Harris Teeter hired Mecia as its first in-house lawyer. The grocer had never had a staff attorney or a legal department, but one of their largest expenses was leasing and acquisitions. The real estate-focused role quickly expanded into a corporate counsel role. Mecia was instrumental in Kroger’s (NYSE: KR) 2013 decision to purchase Harris Teeter. She played a role from due diligence through integration. Other acquisitions and store exchanges, including those with Piggly Wiggly and Lowe’s Foods, have given Mecia greater insight into operations, culture and strategy. On building a legal department: There was so much to be done to build a legal department from scratch and look at the company and all of the processes and figure out how to best adapt those policies. You have to prove your value and show you want to help the business achieve goals in a way that provides better protection for the company and better value for those departments. What makes you a good corporate lawyer? I think it’s my ability to listen to our business partners, understand what they want to do and help them develop the best way to do that while minimizing risk and maximizing value to the company. When you are outside counsel you don’t see the issue until it’s an acute problem. Being in-house and getting in early like I did, I get in on the strategic side. How does the role evolve? The longer you are in-house the more of a business role you just take naturally. The more people on the business side get to know you the more they want your opinion on things that aren’t just legal. What are your passions outside of Harris Teeter ? I’ve been co-chair of Spring Camp Cheerio for the last three years in charge of adult programming. Our 33rd annual camp is in May for families with deaf and hard-of-hearing children. We provide activities for the kids and substantive programming on raising deaf children. It’s such a wonderful weekend and a great opportunity for families with deaf children to get to know one another. My middle daughter is deaf. She’d had a hearing aid all of her life and lost all hearing overnight in October. We were already plugged into the deaf community and were able to move very quickly on her cochlear implants. It’s the only man-made device that can replace a sense. Laura Williams-Tracy is a Charlotte-based freelance writer who can be reached at laura@lwtcommunications.bz.
