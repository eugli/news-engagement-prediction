Boiling Point of Water The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit at 1 atmosphere of pressure (sea level). Jody Dole, Getty Images Updated July 21, 2016 . Question: What Temperature Does Water Boil? \nAt what temperature does water boil? What determines the boiling point of water? Here's the answer to this common question. \nAnswer: The boiling point of water is 100째C or 212째 F at 1 atmosphere of pressure (sea level). \nHowever, the value is not a constant. The boiling point of water depends on the atmospheric pressure, which changes according to elevation. The boiling point of water is 100째C or 212째 F at 1 atmosphere of pressure (sea level), but water boils at a lower temperature as you gain altitude (e.g., on a mountain) and boils at a higher temperature if you increase atmospheric pressure (lived below sea level ). \nThe boiling point of water also depends on the purity of the water. Water which contains impurities (such as salted water ) boils at a higher temperature than pure water. This phenomenon is called boiling point elevation , which is one of the colligative properties of matter.
