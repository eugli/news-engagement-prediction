There's a lot of top quality foreign coaches in the Premier League, but there's also a lot of quality British coaches and managers out there.\" \nSeven of the 20 Premier League clubs have British managers. \nThe current top seven sides are all managed by foreigners, with Welshman Tony Pulis' West Brom the highest-placed team with a British boss. \nGiggs believes if homegrown managers and coaches are not given a chance at the top clubs, then they will never be able to prove they can succeed in the job. \n\"If you don't get the chance, you don't get the chance to prove what you can do and see what you can do with a talented team,\" added Giggs. \n\"As I say, there are quality foreign coaches as well. I just think on the balance, there's too many foreigners at the moment and British coaches probably just don't get the chances.\" Find out more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:35:13.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
