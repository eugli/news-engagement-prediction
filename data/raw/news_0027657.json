Later, at the top of the hour the network recapped the news before airing Tucker Carlson Tonight , which featured interviews with Milo Yiannopoulos protesters and supporters of the controversial Breitbart editor. The network continued to cover the Flynn resignation through Twitter and its on-air news ticker. \nSee some of the reactions below. If @FoxNews doesn't report Flynn there's gonna be millions of Red Hats who wake up tomorrow believing he's still NatSec Adviser. — Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) February 14, 2017 Flynn resignation on every news channel except @FoxNews . I guess they fairly balance @CNN & @MSNBC coverage with a blindfold and earplugs. — michael dybeck (@DybeckM) February 14, 2017 DOWN GOES FLYNN @FoxNews however is covering Ivanka Trump being dropped by Sears and Kmart and labeling it as discrimination. #comeonson — Michael Ealy (@MichaelEaly) February 14, 2017 Hey @FoxNews maybe interrupt @oreillyfactor to tell people about Flynn's resignation instead of talking about Meryl Streep. — Ingrid Michaelson (@ingridmusic) February 14, 2017 That moment when @FoxNews is talking about Ivanka Trump's products instead of covering Michael Flynn's resignation. But @CNN is #FakeNews ? — Alyssa Birchfield (@alyssambirch) February 14, 2017 So Natl. Security Adviser Mike Flynn resigns, coverage by @CNN and @MSNBC . @FoxNews - crickets! SAD! — Byron Hester (@HesterByron) February 14, 2017 Sorry I was wrong about @foxnews they now changed to report on Piers Morgan and JK Rowling feud while Flynn has resigned. #fakenews — Andrew Pierce (@apierce227) February 14, 2017 Michael Flynn resigned six hours ago. @FoxNews still refuses to put it on their website.
