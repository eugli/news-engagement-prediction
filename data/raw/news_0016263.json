Monday, 9th January 2017 We live in turbulent times. Trump has the keys to nuclear weapons, and could end work to prevent climate change. Putin is looming in the East, the far-right are on the rise in Europe and Kim Jong-un is developing nuclear weapons of his own. Is this the END of days? 1 / 13 Getty Images Before his inauguration, Donald Trump asked a security expert three times during a briefing, why the US couldn't use nuclear weapons after he becomes president. \nMolly K. McKew, a former advisor to the President of Georgia and Moldovan Prime Minister, claimed this month that neither Barack Obama or new US President Donald Trump don't realise is the \"West is already at war\". \nIt came after Obama kicke d out scores of Russia n diplomats from the United States over claims its leader Vladimir Putin had used hacking to influence the US election. \n\"What both administrations fail to realize is that the West is already at war, whether it wants to be or not,\" McKew wrote in Politico magazine. \nShe went on: \"So far, [Trump] has chosen to act as if the West no longer matters, seemingly blind to the danger that Putin’s Russia presents to American security and American society. \n\"The question ahead of us is whether Trump will aid the Kremlin’s goals with his anti-globalist, anti-NATO rhetoric – or whether he’ll clearly see the end of the old order, grasp the nature of the war we are in, and have the vision and the confrontational spirit to win it.\" Who has Nukes? These are the countries in the world's nuclear weapons club. 1 / 6 Getty Images According to 2016 data from the Federation of American Scientists, the United States has an estimated inventory of 7,000 nuclear warheads, with 1,750 of them strategically deployed. “More troops, tanks and armoured personnel carriers are being brought to Europe” Mikhail Gorbachev \nHer comments come as Trump signaled he wanted to have a better relationship with Russia, having previously praised Putin as a \"smart guy\". \nAnd in a move away from the position of previous US Presidents, Trump has repeatedly threatened to pull funding from NATO – effectively the main Europe defence system consisting of troops from all 28 members states. \nWithout US support, the NATO defence system would be seriously under threat, leaving all of Europe vulnerable to a Russian invasion. \nIn the last few weeks alone, thousands of tanks and troops have moved to Russia's border with the aim of protecting Eastern European countries. Operation Iron Sword: Watch 4,000 troops prepare for war Monday, 28th November 2016 Eleven NATO countries have sent 4,000 troops to Lithuania to participate in this year’s Iron Sword exercises. 1 / 36 Getty Images Members of the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade prepare a simulated attack \nFormer Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev also warned this week the world is clearly \"preparing for war\". \nThe ex-statesman, who oversaw the breakup of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, said the current militarization of politics and the new arms race is \"too dangerous\" to go on. \n\"More troops, tanks and armoured personnel carriers are being brought to Europe. NATO and Russian forces and weapons that used to be deployed at a distance are now placed closer to each other, as if to shoot point-blank,\" he wrote in a piece for TIME magazine. \nHe went on: \"The nuclear threat once again seems real. Relations between the great powers have been going from bad to worse for several years now. \n\"It all looks as if the world is preparing for war.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:06:32.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
