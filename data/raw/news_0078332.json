Sit down. Won’t take long. \nTime for the father of fantasy footy to hit you between the eyes with a truth you need to hear. \nThe problem? You’ve been spoiled. \nYou stuffed Gold Coast Suns and GWS Giants rookies into your team for years after they came into the comp. \nLast year, Essendon offered up more easy pickings, playing kids to fill the void left by its banned players. Too easy. \nToday, right here and now, I’m telling you that those days of rookie milk and honey are over. \nAnd nowhere will the unprepared find less SuperCoach rookie milk and/or honey this year than in the midfield. \nDon’t you worry, let’s get on the front foot and have a look at five midfield eligible rookies who presented themselves as options over the weekend. \nSAM POWELL-PEPPER (Port Adelaide) \nPrice: $135,300 \nPosition: Midfielder \nWeek 2 stats: 56 SuperCoach points, 12 disposals at 67% efficiency, 7 contested possessions, 4 tackles, 67% time on ground. \nDON’T worry about his stats, Port have a contested beast on its hands here. \nBuilt like a truck and ready to go. At one point he emerged from a pack with the pill with three grown men hanging off him like rag dolls. \nAroused me incredibly. Lock him on. Adelaide’s Harrison Wigg was prolific against Richmond. Picture: Tom Huntley Source: News Corp Australia \nHARRISON WIGG (Adelaide) \nPrice: $123,900 \nPosition: Midfielder \nWeek 2 stats: 70 SuperCoach points, 23 disposals at 65% efficiency, 8 contested possessions, 4 rebound 50s, 66% time on ground. \nTHIS kid had 16 touches of the aggot before half-time. Almost ran the shop in the guts for the Crows on Friday night. Very promising signs. \nAdelaide didn’t have Rory Sloane, Scotty Thompson or Brad Crouch out there, so he’ll need to back it up next week to whack a Round 1 stake in the ground. \nWILL BRODIE (Gold Coast Suns) \nPrice: $175,800 \nPosition: Midfielder \nWeek 2 stats: 97 SuperCoach points, 2 goals, 18 disposals at 72% efficiency, 11 contested possessions, 4 clearances, 75% time on ground. \nHARD not to be impressed with what we saw from the kid on Sunday arvo. \nAttended a team-high 16 centre bounces and put his hand up as a future jet of the game. \nHowever, Gold Coast has a deep midfield. Gary Ablett, Aaron Hall, Michael Rischetelli, Matt Rosa, Jarryd Lyons and Jarrod Harbrow all sat out for Sunday’s game. \nBut keep watching him. Might just bludgeon his way into the best 22 if he keeps this up. \nMITCHELL HIBBERD (North Melbourne) \nPrice: $123,900 \nPosition: Defender / Midfielder \nWeek 2 stats: 72 SuperCoach points, 25 disposals at 80% efficiency, 6 contested possessions, 4 inside 50s, 85% time on ground. \nOPPORTUNITY — there’s a bit of it around at Arden Street this year and Mitch grabbed a slice on Sunday against Hawthorn. \nButchered the pill with six clangers, but still had plenty of it. \nIt’s shaping as a race between Hibberd and his mate Ed Vickers-Willis for that defensive role in the best 22. North Melbourne’s Mitchell Hibberd got plenty of the footy against Hawthorn. Source: Getty Images \nTEIA MILES (Hawthorn) \nPrice: $123,900 \nPosition: Forward / Midfielder \nWeek 2 stats: 46 SuperCoach points, 10 disposals at 90% efficiency, 4 marks, 74% time on ground. \nHAS been given a run in both of Hawthorn’s JLT games and continues to impress. \nMopping it up across half back and he’s taking kick-out duties in stages, which tells you Alastair Clarkson rates his decision-making cortex. \nPoint-scoring capacity could be a worry, but a warm body on your midfield bench might do the trick this year. \nWatch these midfield lads closely folks. Nail the right ones and mark my words — you’ll be on your way to SuperCoach supremacy in 2017.
