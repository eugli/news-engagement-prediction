Image caption The strap was frequently used in Scottish classrooms until the 1980s \n\"The culture of the society completely accepted this. The parents were all for it,\" historian Sir Tom Devine tells the BBC Scotland documentary Growing up in Scotland: A century of childhood . \nAccording to educational policy expert Prof Lindsay Paterson: \"The threat of physical violence was present in schools but then it was present in families, it was present in communities, it was present through the church. \n\"The schools simply saw themselves as reproducing that - ethics were to be instilled partly by the threat of violence.\" \nStudents were not only disciplined for disobeying rules or disorderly behaviour but simply for not understanding a lesson, or for answering a question incorrectly. Image caption The Lochgelly Tawse was the most popular design \nProf Devine, from Edinburgh University, says: \"There is plenty of evidence that if you failed to gain a certain mark then the belt would be produced.\" \nThe Reverend Bill Brown tells the Growing up in Scotland programme he got belted one day for spelling Canada with a small 'c'. \nHe says: \"It led to a mini breakdown. It was almost like a mental breakdown. \n\"The consequence of which was that I became withdrawn. I missed a couple of years of school.\" \nHe adds: \"I think it is appalling to think we would hit children with a belt like this. \n\"It is incredible to think there was actually a production line producing these so that teachers would always have one.\" \nThroughout the mid-20th century, Scotland's saddlers and leather makers developed their techniques in creating a tawse that was fast to manufacturer, easy to wield, yet firm when used. Image caption The tawse was designed to hurt the hands but not draw blood \nHowever one manufacturer's design rose above the rest, and is said to have held the majority of the tawse market, estimated at 70%. \nBased in Lochgelly, Fife, John J Dick Leather Goods were the teacher's preferred suppliers at the height of the tawse's reign of terror. \nThe Lochgelly Tawse was made by cutting 2ft long strips of leather from pre-tanned and pre-curried hides. \nThe leather would then be dressed and cut halfway up the middle to form the tails. \nThe particular design of the tails provided the searing nip when it struck the student's hand. \nHowever, the Lochgelly method was preferable in that the tails were \"edged\" in order to prevent drawing blood. \nIn the early 1970s demand for the tawse was strong but a modern manufacturing method was required to keep up with orders from teachers not just in Scotland, but across the UK. \nThe company modernised their method with a state-of-the-art three-phase cutting press, allowing manufacturing of the tawse on a factory scale. \nBy the end of the 1970s it became harder to source leather thick enough to manufacture the heavier versions of the tawse and public opinion on corporal punishment was slowly starting to change. \nBy 1983 the use of corporal punishment was beginning to be phased out in state schools after two Scottish mothers won an action in the European Court of Human Rights. \nUse of the Lochgelly Tawse and any other form of corporal Punishment was finally banned in state schools in 1987, with Scottish private schools following suit over 10 years later in 1998. \nMargaret Dick is granddaughter of George Dick and daughter of John Dick, the men behind the infamous Lochgelly design. \nShe still runs the family leather goods business from Lochgelly, supplying leather wares for Sgain Dubhs, harnesses and handbags. \nSurprisingly the manufacturing of the tawse continues, though only as a collector's item, and not on the scale of years gone by. \nMargaret has mixed feelings about the tawse and finds it surprising that so many people are still interested in it. \nShe says: \"It's just part of the history of my family, and like it or lump it, I'm stuck with that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:08:01.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
