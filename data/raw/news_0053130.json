Photo: The Canadian Press/ AP \nOn the ground, members of Australia's 80-strong special forces contingent have supported 453 strikes in the area in three months. \nSituated within 50 kilometres of the frontline - the closest they have officially been to the fighting - they helped treat dozens of wounded Iraqi soldiers a day during the early days of the \"ferocious\" fighting in East Mosul last year. Many were victims of improvised explosive devices and sniper fire. \nEast Mosul was retaken last month, with life in that section of the city now slowly returning to normal despite the threat of suicide bombings, rocket fire and IS \"sleeper cells\" intent on driving the coalition out of the city. \nBut with the focus now shifting to West Mosul, fighting will intensify. The narrow streets of the older parts of the city are ideal for IS defenders, who have had time to build tunnels, defensive positions and interconnected strongholds. It's ideal for snipers and concealed explosives, but hard for Iraq's heavy vehicles - and Australia's air support. \nThe fight will be complicated by the presence of up to 750,000 civilians in the area. \nIt's not known how many fighters IS still have in the city but Admiral Johnston says its possible Australians are among them. \n\"The liberation of Mosul will not be the end of the mission to defeat Da'esh (IS) in Iraq. But its successful conclusion will increase the pressure on Da'esh both within Iraq and in Syria,\" Admiral Johnston said. \nElsewhere in Iraq, Australian soldiers have established \"mobile training teams\" to train Iraqi authorities throughout the country. They have helped train some 19,000 soldiers and have now turned their focus to training police. \nFollow us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:03:14.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
