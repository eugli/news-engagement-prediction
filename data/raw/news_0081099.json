Ryan Zinke overcame a key procedural hurdle on the Senate floor Monday evening, getting him one step closer to becoming President Trump's first secretary of the interior.\nThe full Senate voted to end debate on the former Republican congressman from Montana to head the Interior Department. That sets up 30 hours of debate on Zinke's nomination, which will be followed by a mid-week confirmation vote.\nAs interior secretary, Zinke will oversee energy development on federal lands and waters, the protection of endangered species and the operation of the country's national parks.\nThe 67-31 vote in favor of Zinke was not expected to be particularly constrained or controversial.

Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon abstained from voting for him last month.\nThe biggest sticking point for Democrats is President Trump's focus on fossil fuel development on federal lands, including coal development to support his infrastructure and job development goals.\nSen.

I don't know where that stops.\"\nAlso   DNC chief Perez has his own radical religious side Tom Perez has often used fiery and explicitly religious rhetoric in an effort to help various liberal causes.\nBy Sean Higgins â€¢ 02/27/17 8:31 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:01:20.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
