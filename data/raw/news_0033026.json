Close Firefighters Struggle to Contain Bushfires Burning Near Christchurch UP NEXT VIDEO Firefighters Struggle to Contain Bushfires Burning Near Christchurch \nDavid Steven Askin, 38, died when the Squirrel helicopter he was flying crashed near Sugar Loaf carpark on Tuesday at a time when a dozen choppers were fighting rapidly spreading blazes in the area. \nThe Defence Force on Wednesday confirmed Mr Askin - then Corporal Askin - had been an elite soldier with the SAS, and had been awarded the New Zealand Gallantry Star in 2014 for his service in Afghanistan. \nIt said during a Taliban attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul in 2011 Mr Askin was wounded by grenade and rifle fire, but carried on rescuing hotel guests as a fire broke out. \n\"He was also cited on a number of other occasions for exceptional bravery during operations in Afghanistan,\" the Defence Force said. Helicopter pilot David Steven Askin died after crashing in Christchurch's Port Hills while battling a blaze. Photo: AFP/Pedro Ugarte \nMajor General Peter Kelly said Mr Askin's performance was of the \"highest order\". \n\"During his time in Afghanistan, Corporal Askin displayed great gallantry and leadership in the face of the enemy. He put himself in the line of fire, and put the objectives of the mission before his personal wellbeing,\" he said. \n\"He was an outstanding soldier who served his country with bravery and commitment - the same bravery and commitment he showed in helping his community fight these fires.\" \nMr Askin enlisted in the army in 1998 and left in 2013, but remained in the SAS Reserves. \nHe was awarded the Gallantry Star - New Zealand's second-highest gallantry award - in 2014 without his identity being made public, simply being referred to as \"Serviceman D\" by Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee at the time. \nMr Brownlee on Wednesday said there was no doubt Mr Askin was \"one of New Zealand's heroes\". \n\"For him to have lost his life trying to save other lives ... is, I guess, a bit of a metaphor for the whole life that he's lived,\" he said. \n\"A great New Zealander, a tragic death.\" Steve Askin was fighting the fires that have torn through Port Hills in Christchurch. Photo credit: Way to Go Heliservices \nDescribed as a survivor, Mr Askin was laconic in the wake of his 2011 injury, friend and Fairfax reporter Charles Anderson wrote on Wednesday. \n\"What concerned Steve most was not that the bullet was millimetres away from his skull,\" he said. \n\"It was that the sound of the gunshot may have deafened him and he wouldn't be able to sit his helicopter's pilot licence - something he planned on doing when he left the army.\" \nMr Askin went on to not only help fight bushfires as a helicopter pilot but also ferried goods into Kaikoura after the November earthquake. \nChristchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel called Mr Askin's death tragic. \n\"There really is no greater sacrifice than to risk your life in the service of others,\" she said. \nThree Transport Accident Investigation Commission investigators are now at the site of Tuesday's crash, around two kilometres from the fire front, as firefighters continue to battle multiple blazes in the Port Hills. \nFIND out what people are saying about this story on our Facebook page .
