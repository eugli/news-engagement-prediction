But Emma, 37, who is expecting again, reveals how during her first pregnancy , at 41 weeks, she noticed her baby wasn’t moving. \nEmma says she felt absolutely fine through her first pregnancy and continued working until she was at 38 weeks. \nBut when the baby was a week overdue, she started to feel anxious. \n“I’d had absolutely great care at London’s Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where the midwives and doctors are wonderful,” Emma says. \n“But it was a Friday, and I worried about care over the weekend. I knew about the charity Kicks Count, which reminds mums to monitor the baby’s movements throughout pregnancy.” \nShe reveals how she’d had an incident when she was around 30 weeks, and had started to feel faint. \n“I went to hospital where they listened to the baby’s healthy heartbeat and reassured me,” Emma says. \n“They said then that if my baby stopped moving for more than an hour or so I should seek help.” Read More Women who undergo IVF treatment within 21 days of clocks going forward are TWICE as likely to miscarry Charity Kicks Count reminds mums to monitor their baby's movements throughout prengnancy (Photo: Jeremy Peters) \nOn the Friday night when she was overdue, Emma says she had a bath, but around 1am realised she hadn’t felt the baby kick since about 9pm. \n“I was worried,” she says. “I didn’t want to wake my partner Jeremy so I went downstairs until 3.30am.” \nEmma says she tried lying on her left side as doctors had said it was best for blood circulation to the baby. She also drank a huge glass of very cold water to see if the baby would respond. But still nothing. \nSo Emma called the hospital and was told to go straight in. She recalls: “When they picked up the baby’s heartbeat, we thought we could relax. But then the heartbeat dropped – it was terrifying. \n“They rushed me to the labour ward and broke my waters. They were dark brown and stained with meconium – the baby’s waste – which is a sign it was in distress. I’d wanted a natural birth, but I had to have an emergency caesarean.” \nHer baby girl, Mary, was delivered, but she had inhaled the meconium. She was in distress so was rushed to intensive care. \nEmma says: “I recovered slowly on the maternity ward, but I realised I was the only woman without a baby. I dreaded the worst. \n“‘She should be fine’, the doctor reassured me. I didn’t like that ‘should’ – I kept thinking the worst. \n“And I kept wondering what might have happened if I’d never heard of Kicks Count, and had simply gone back to bed – who knows?” Read More The unpleasant signs your body gives off if you're having a girl Emma dreads to think what might have happened if she hadn't noticed Mary's lack of movement (Photo: Jeremy Peters) \nBut Mary was fine. After her spell in intensive care, she spent three days on the high dependency ward. Finally, she joined Emma on the maternity ward and they were both discharged. “Now I know how lucky I was,” says Emma. \n“I now speak out for Kicks Count – I know there are mothers who go for hours without feeling a movement, and the baby doesn’t make it. \n“Sadly there are still too many misconceptions around – some people still believe that the baby moves less in late pregnancy, which isn’t true at all. Now I know that if your baby stops moving, you need to call for help urgently.” \nEmma says they still don’t know why she had problems, but today Mary is a “boisterous 15-month-old, and a cheeky little monkey”. \nThe family are currently spending time in their apartment in Cape Town, South Africa, but they’ll be returning home before the new baby is due. \nEmma is now 17 weeks pregnant and says: “While giving birth still seems a long way off, I know I’ll be in the care of a wonderful set of midwives and doctors, and can ask for help any time I’m worried. \n“But I won’t risk going through it all again. I’m hoping for an elective caesarean this time, at 39 weeks, so there is no risk of the baby getting distressed. \n“I can’t face sitting around worrying and monitoring every movement to make sure my new baby isn’t getting into trouble as well.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:21:12.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
