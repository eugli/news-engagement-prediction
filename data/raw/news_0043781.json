(Twitter) \nSpanish police have fired shots a truck which was full of gas canisters and driving at high speed in the wrong direction towards Barcelona’s city centre. \nThe Telegraph reports the driver stole the truck and sped off on Tuesday morning local time. \nThe driver, who is a Swedish citizen, allegedly refused to stop and was going in the wrong direction near the city centre. \nMireia Ruiz, a woman who saw the truck from her home nearby, said the driver ignored people screaming at him to stop as he sped down the wrong side of a ring road. \n\"When people shouted at him, he would laugh and make offensive gestures with his hand,\" she said. \nOne officer shot at the truck’s rear window forcing the vehicle to stop. \nThe driver was arrested and taken to hospital where he is being questioned by police. \nBarcelona's city hall said the small white truck -- which had dozens of orange gas bottles stacked on the back in plain view -- had been stolen. \nThere was no indication as yet whether this was an attempted attack or just a plain robbery. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:20:09.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
