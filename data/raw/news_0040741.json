Defending Meunier largely dealt with Neymar (Picture: AFP/Getty) \nIn the first half, Meunier largely had Neymar in his pocket. \nThe Belgian stood the Brazilian up well whenever he ran at him and he dealt with the tricky attacker comfortably whenever he was isolated. \nSemedo also looked decent when one-on-one with Reus but made a few rash challenges when he was drawn inside, with one leading to a glorious opportunity for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, which the Gabon international blazed over. \nA similar incident followed in the second half, which allowed Dembele in and there were certainly moments of indecision for the 23-year-old. Attacking Semedo didn’t get forward too often (Picture: Getty) \nMeunier showed his quality with a brilliant cross in the opening exchanges of the match, with his whipped ball narrowly evading Edinson Cavani. \nHe went one better in the second half, showing some fabulous skill to skip past Neymar then strolled through Barcelona’s half before releasing Cavani to add a fourth on a fantastic night at the Parc des Princes. \nSemedo found himself pegged back by Reus more often than not and didn’t really get the opportunity to shine in an attacking capacity.
