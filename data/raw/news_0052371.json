By Matt Ferner \nThe Anti-Defamation League received a bomb threat at it’s headquarters in New York City, the group announced Wednesday. \n“Today the ADL’s national headquarters in New York received an anonymous bomb threat,” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. “While there is no information at this time to indicate that this is more than a threat, we are taking it very seriously.” This morning @ADL_national received a bomb threat. We're just one of many #Jewish groups that has been targeted. More below. pic.twitter.com/2DI5JUCIY1 — Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) February 22, 2017 \nGreenblatt said the civil rights group is working with law enforcement officials to determine if the threat is connected to a recent spate of bomb threats targeting Jewish community centers around the nation. \nAt least 11 JCCs in 10 states received threatening phone calls on Monday. It was the fourth series of such messages this year. About 70 threats have been aimed at almost 60 JCCs in 27 states and one Canadian province since Jan. 1. \nAnti-Semitic hate crimes make up the largest portion of religiously motivated attacks in the United States. \nThe series of bomb threats against the JCCs is “ unprecedented ,” Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told The Huffington Post earlier this week. \n“I’ve been working at SPLC since 1999. I’ve never seen a string of attacks like this that are targeting the same kind of institution in the same kind of way,” she said. “This is new.” \nIt remains unclear who is making the threats or if they are coming from a single person or a group. \nThe FBI and the Department of Justice have said they are “investigating possible civil rights violations in connection with the threats.” \nOren Segal, director of the ADL’s Center on Extremism, told HuffPost that the organization has been in close communication with the FBI over the incidents and is “confident that they are conducting a serious investigation into these threats.” \nLast month, he said, the ADL partnered with the agency to organize a briefing for hundreds of representatives from the Jewish community regarding security matters. \n“This is not the first time that ADL has been targeted,” Greenblatt said, “and it will not deter us in our efforts to combat anti-Semitism and hate against people of all races and religions.” \nThis is a developing story.
