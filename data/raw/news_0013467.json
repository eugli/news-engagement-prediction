Haha! Oxlade-Chamberlain's latest 'like' on twitter.... pic.twitter.com/Mx3enY4mpo — Doc (@Doc_Joshi) February 4, 2017 \nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain risked angering Arsene Wenger after the Arsenal midfielder 'liked' a tweet calling for the Gunners boss to be sacked following Saturday's 3-1 defeat against Chelsea. \nWenger's side saw their title challenge suffer a huge setback as they were blown away by Premier League leaders Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. \nThe third placed Gunners now trail Chelsea by 12 points and Oxlade-Chamberlain added to the tension around his team when he appeared to show support for a Twitter post demanding Wenger's dismissal. \nLess than an hour after the full-time whistle, Oxlade Chamberlain, who was used by Wenger in an out of position central midfield role against Chelsea, liked a Twitter post from popular Arsenal YouTube channel, Arsenal Fan TV, with a video entitled \"Wenger Needs to Go!\" \nOxlade-Chamberlain apparently didn't understand what he was adding his backing to and the England international quickly removed his like of the tweet, but not before it had been spotted by a wider internet audience. \nAt a time when Wenger, currently serving a touchline ban, is sure to come under fire from frustrated Arsenal fans, Oxlade-Chamberlain tried to limit the damage when he returned to social media later in the day. \n\"I didn't mean to like that post earlier obviously. Didn't even realise I had!\" he wrote. I didn't mean to like that post earlier obviously...
