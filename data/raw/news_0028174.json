And Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid teamed up for Alexander Wang's Spring 2017 show on Saturday at New York Fashion Week.

Catwalk queens! Kendall Jenner, 21, and Bella Hadid, 20, ruled the runway at Alexander Wang's Spring 2017 show on Saturday at New York Fashion Week Kendall, 21, modeled leather trousers, booties, and a leather choker as she wore a masculine button down top. While Bella, 20, sported the same booties but with a twist - leather hotpants over black leggings with a statement shirt. Earlier that day Wang revealed he has an upcoming Adidas collaboration, and teased it at fashion week by walking the runway. Meanwhile, Kylie Jenner was on hand backstage to snap selfies with Kendall and Bella, clearly proud of her sister and pal. Street chic: The younger sister of supermodel Gigi Hadid donned a black and white printed top which read, 'Night Of Treason' while making her way down the catwalk Lean limbs: The brunette beauty donned skintight black leather pants which encased her endless slender pins Kendall recently answered questions for a fun Q&A for Vogue. In the session the girls - along with fellow cover stars Ashley Graham, Adwoa Aboah, Liu Wen, Vittoria Ceretti, and Imaan Hammam - take turns asking each other questions. Kendall was asked what tattoo she would give Gigi and the KUWTK star replied that 'it would have something to do with me - right on her forehead'. The leggy brunette then cheekily added that the tattoo should instead go on Gigi's chest and say 'Kenny is the best'. Italian beauty Vittoria asked Kendall what she would choose if she had to eat only chips and guacamole or cheese quesadilla for the rest of her life. Fancy footwear! The Victoria's Secret model added extra height to her statuesque frame in a pair of black leather studded heels Proud: Kylie Jenner, 19, attended the highly-coveted presentation as she showed support for her older sister Picture perfect! The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star posed up a storm and took selfies backstage with gal pal Bella Kendall chose chips and guac as it 'sounds a little healthier'. Gigi revealed that if she wasn't a supermodel she'd probably still be in school and playing volleyball. Meanwhile Ashley, 28, confessed that she's not bad at anything and joked 'because I don't do anything I'm bad at'. Liu, 29, admitted her favorite McDonald's snack is french fries. Who would play Adwoa in the movie version of her life? Morgan Freeman of course, came the response from the British born beauty. Gorgeous gals! The stunning trio posed backstage as Kylie flaunted her taut tummy in a cutout cropped top Lovely in leather: The genetically-gifted stunner wore a pair of black opaque tights and leather shorts The seven women looked fantastic during the photoshoot wearing black turtlenecks and colorful patterned shorts as they danced and posed for the camera. Vogue's March issue declares 'No norm is the new norm' on its front cover and celebrates the changing landscape of the fashion world and women inhabiting their 'own particular gorgeousness' Kendall said: 'With all that’s going on in the world, this cover makes such an important statement. It’s like, hey, we’ve got our differences, but those differences are beautiful. Everyone is beautiful.' The edition also features Adriana Lima, Jasmine Tookes and Jasmine Sanders posing in slinky blush tone slips. Discussing the evolving definition of beauty, Vogue invited several designers to share their thoughts including Stella McCartney, Michael Kors and Prabal Gurung.
