Assuming it to be a case of loot, he called up the police in the wee hours on Sunday. \nGamit and police inspector JV Amin, who was on night patrolling duty in the area, rushed to the spot. \nThe police then called up the branch manager and an official of the agency to the site. \nAfter ascertaining that the cash bundles were intact, they were handed it over to the branch manager. \n“We will also watch the CCTV footage. It is surprising that nobody noticed the box lying near the ATM for three-four days,” Gamit said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:10:13.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
