Anytime Disable HTML5 Autoplay prevents a video from playing, it indicates this in the upper right corner of your browser, where the rest of your extensions reside. \nFor those that who to enable audio and video autoplay on certain pages or websites, the extension comes with a handy ‘Mode Rules List’ that lets you do just that. While it isn’t as straightforward as using a standard ‘whitelist’ option, it does provide an equivalent functionality. Here are some instructions on how to use it. \nWhile the extension has been around since last year, the recent introduction of autoplay video with sound in Facebook and a heap of other websites has made it ever more relevant. \nIn case you’re curious to have a look at the code for Disable HTML5 Autoplay, Eloston has open-sourced the extension on GitHub. Head to this repository for more details. \nStop the autoplay madness and get the extension from the Chrome Web Store here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T15:14:53.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
