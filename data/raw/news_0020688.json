Evans couldn’t remain silent after Duke gave his support for Attorney General Jeff Sessions ’ confirmation. \nThe actor tweeted, “If David Duke....DAVID!...DUKE!... thinks you’re right, then you are unequivocally wrong.” If David Duke....DAVID!...DUKE!... thinks you're right, then you are unequivocally wrong. The confirmation of @jeffsessions is beyond words. https://t.co/CuLUznwO6S — Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) February 9, 2017 \nLike villains would do in Marvel movies, Duke fired back, calling Evans a “typical dumb actor.” Typical dumb actor - if everything I say is wrong, then when I say I oppose these Zionists wars, you must be for them, Captain America!? https://t.co/fsxQHgzdWD — David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) February 9, 2017 \nOh, but Captain America wasn’t done. Evans turned Duke’s own words against him. @DrDavidDuke well if these nuggets of bigotry are some of your OTHER thoughts, then I stand by my original tweet https://t.co/YSrOCDuyBw — Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) February 9, 2017 \nHe later tweeted out, “We can’t let hatred be the loudest voice.” We can't let hatred be the loudest voice. https://t.co/bqRPRXo453 — Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) February 9, 2017 \nThe Huffington Post recently asked Evans’ “Avengers” co-star Cobie Smulders if she and her castmates were the Avengers in real life. She didn’t confirm or deny the notion but said, “I think they want to do good, and they want people to be happy, and they want to speak what they believe.” \nJust keep speaking what you believe, Captain.
