(photo credit:REUTERS) \nFormer adult film star Jenna Jameson has roused a firestorm of controversy after engaging in a fervent online tirade against Muslims.An hours-long series of fiery Twitter posts ensued after the 42-year-old mother-to-be published a tweet that read \"Repeat after me... Muslim rape gangs\" and linked to a reported account about a mother who was allegedly raped by migrants in Sweden. Jenna Jameson dukes it out with ex-KKK grand wizard over Netanyahu crush \"I don't \"hate\" them... I disagree with absolutely everything they represent, and I am utterly unafraid to express my opinion,\" she later wrote in reference to Muslims. I don't \"hate\" them... I disagree with absolutely everything they represent, and I am utterly unafraid to express my opinion. https://t.co/z4kMY4htgi — Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 21, 2017 At one point during the volley of heated social media posts, Jameson mentioned the KKK in apparent reference to Islamic extremists, writing: \"Do the klu klux klan follow a religion that orders the death of apostates? When was the last time we saw a klan member blow up infidels?\" Do the klu klux klan follow a religion that orders the death of apostates? When was the last time we saw a klan member blow up infidels? https://t.co/JyCNx6Vter — Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 21, 2017 The controversial comment spurred a stream responses from both sides of the spectrum and a vehement virtual dispute that eventually led her to state: \"I wish people would stop asking me why I speak out against muslims [sic].\"However, Jameson, who describes herself as \"conservative\" and \"Jewish and proud,\" further continued to assert that she disagrees with Islamic Sharia law. \"I disagree with following an ideology that abuses women, kills gays, mutilates female children and murders apostates,\" she tweeted as the back-and-forth with other Twitter users continued. \"Even moderate muslims [sic] believe homosexuality is a criminal offense, polygamy is the norm, women are considered animals. Shall I go on?\" she charged. You worship a prophet that bragged about butchering hundred of thousands of my people (Jews) which is reiterated in the Quran. https://t.co/ado28iMlGo — Jenna Jameson (@jennajameson) February 21, 2017 \"Actually Israel is the only place in the Middle East where homosexuality is accepted and celebrated,\" later wrote Jameson, whose husband Lior Bitton is Israeli. \"My husband is a morrocan [sic] Jew... his family was forced from morocco by the escalating violent Muslim climate there.\"The string of outspoken tweets continues as Jameson attempted to fight off accusations of racism, hate and misunderstanding in her religious rantings. In addition, she also shot back to several charges against Jews. \"I am a Zionist Jew, you cockroach,\" she said in response to an accusation of \"Jew loving\" several messages before signing off.
