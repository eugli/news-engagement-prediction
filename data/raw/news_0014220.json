Nagarjuna Reddy was injured when Amanchi Krishna Mohan 's brother Amanchi Swamulu and his supporters beat him up near a police station in Chirala town of Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh. \n\nThe incident occurred on Sunday but came to light on Monday after the visuals of the attack went viral over social media. \n\nThe journalist, who works for a Telugu newspaper, was knocked down from his two-wheeler when he was on his way to a shop with his son. Swamulu and others chased him on the streets and attacked him with sticks. \n\nPeople watched helplessly and nobody came to the victim's help. The journalist, who suffered bleeding injuries, was later taken to a hospital. \n\nThe police registered a case against Swamulu and others but no arrests have been made. \n\nBut on a complaint by the MLA's brother, the police booked the journalist under SC ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The complainant alleged that Nagarjuna Reddy abused him citing his caste. \n\nThe journalist said Krishna Mohan was angry after he recently wrote a story in a newspaper about his alleged corruption. \n\nThe journalist wrote that Krishna Mohan and his brother had borrowed loans from banks in the name of eligible candidates belonging to economically backward sections. When the loans were not repaid, the banks reportedly approached the people under whose names the loans were taken. \n\nKrishna Mohan, belonging to ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP), represents Chirala constituency. \n\nNagarjuna Reddy said four attempts on his life were made during the last 10 years as he had been fearlessly raising his voice against the corruption and repression let loose by the MLA and his family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:22:42.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
