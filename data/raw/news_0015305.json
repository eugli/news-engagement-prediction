The 6-foot-1, 180-pound prospect just picked up an offer from Oregon, pushing him to 25 scholarships to date. \n\"To be honest, my outlook on recruiting has not really changed yet,\" Johnson said, on vsporto's SEC Recruiting Buzz. \"UCLA is still one of the schools that sticks out to me. The Oregon offer sticks out to me as well. That is a huge one. For the most part, my recruitment has stayed the same. I am just focused on getting this season underway and winning this fifth state championship in a row.\" \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?

After his summer trip, Johnson told Dawgs247 that if he stayed close to home, Georgia would be the pick . Johnson said that outlook has not changed. \n\"I love Athens,\" Johnson said. \"It is a wonderful place, small-town city where everyone gets along with everyone. They have Coach Smart and Coach Smart is a genius. Then they have Coach Tucker. Coach Tucker was an NFL coach, so he knows exactly what the NFL is looking for. I feel like they have a great shot at preparing me for the next level and developing me as a young man.\" \nThe 247Sports Composite five-star prospect noticed his top two programs did well recruiting the secondary in the 2017 cycle. \n\"Georgia and UCLA, they stacked up,\" Johnson said. \"I love it - it is just more competition.\" \nExpect Johnson to use this summer to take visits and narrow his options down. \n\"I do not have any official leaders right now,\" Johnson said. \"I will cross that bridge when I get there. It is just one of those things where Georgia always feels like home.\" \nListen to the full interview above, which includes Johnson discussing other programs in the mix, how he evaluates the defensive back signees that Georgia signed, and a breakdown of Johnson as a prospect and insight into his recruitment.
