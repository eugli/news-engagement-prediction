That resulted in Taj Gibson being traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder. \nTrading Taj Gibson in the middle of his eighth season of the franchise was a huge decision for the Bulls, and Butler had a few words of wisdom for his departing friend. \n\"Go get the bag,\" Butler told Gibson, according to Sea Highkin of The Athletic: Chicago. \nGIbson is in the final year of his contract, earning a cool $8.9 million this season. The 31-year-old veteran likely has one last big contract left in his career, which Butler is hoping he rasies the value of through the remainder of the season. \nJoining Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder gives Gibson a great opportunity to prove his worth as a veteran frontcourt player. \nAny contending team should have interest in Gibson next summer, who's held his head high during his long tenure with the Bulls. \nTaj has been one of the most consistent aspects of the Bulls over the years, being a huge part of both the Derrick Rose era and rise of Jimmy Butler. \nGibson has been a consummate professional, can hit a 15-footer, rebound like a mad man and hustles on defense. It's not hard to imagine any number of teams showing up with a bag full of money with his name on it.
