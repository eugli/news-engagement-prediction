Only two configurations will be made available, according to the report, with 64- and 256-gigabyte versions shipping at launch.\n\nAlso expected in the fall, the \"iPhone 7s\" and \"iPhone 7s Plus\" are expected to retain 32-gigabyte configurations at the low-end, and have 2 and 3 gigabytes of RAM, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, the device is said to carry 3 gigabytes of mobile DRAM of an unspecified type. For comparison. the currently shipping iPhone 7 has 2 gigabytes of LPDDR4 RAM, and the iPhone 7 Plus has 3 gigs.\n\nAt present, the only new iPhone still available with 16 gigabytes is the $399 iPhone SE, with a 64-gigabyte version selling for $449. The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are still available, but the 16-gigabyte versions have been discontinued in favor of updated low-end versions with 32 gigabytes retailing for $549 and $649 respectively.\n\nApple is thought to be working on three new iPhones, including two modest \"iPhone 7s\" upgrades and a flagship \"iPhone 8,\" which is rumored to include a 5.2-inch curved OLED display with embedded sensors, wireless charging of some sort, and possibly some form of facial recognition technology .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:58:07.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
