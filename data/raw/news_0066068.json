Rebuild an opportunity to boost local training \nA spokesman for the Roper Gulf Council said the NT Government handed it the causeway \"many years ago\". \n\"The council has never received specific funding for its ongoing maintenance,\" he said. \n\"At this stage, a repair cost and timeframe has not been determined, but the council is working with stakeholders to ensure it is reopened and able to again be utilised by the Borroloola community as soon as is practicable. \n\"The council is liaising with the NT Government to investigate if any national disaster relief assistance is available to fund the cost of the repairs.\" \nLocal member Gerry McCarthy took to Facebook to update the community on the situation. \n\"Take care on Rocky Creek Bridge as the collapsed cell will be inspected and repairs conducted when water level drops. Plans for a safe pedestrian walkway are in motion with construction soon. Road traffic to south end of town via rubbish dump road for the time being, please be patient and safe on the roads,\" he wrote. Photo: Floodwaters inundated the causeway at Rocky Creek Bridge. (Supplied: Fred Graham) \nMr Crofts warned the local Roper Gulf Council and the NT Government from getting caught up in a bureaucratic tangle over who is responsible for repairing the bridge. \n\"What we'd like to see is somebody stand up and take leadership for it and actually have it done quickly, because if this takes up to six months, we're back in the wet season and this town has lost all [those] tourism dollars and they've lost everything else, it's just been a total financial burden on the community,\" he said. \n\"We had more storms and rain last night, we still have a month or six weeks of the wet season to go.\" \nMr Crofts said rebuilding the bridge could be an chance to upskill locals. \n\"If we're serious about Aboriginal employment and teaching people, here's an opportunity: bring in a contractor, have it managed properly ... and let's get a proper bridge built and one the town can be proud of because it was built by people in the town.\" \n\"There's businesses here who are going to lose money so they're going to need income from this construction to help top them up. \n\"The money should not be leaving this town, which is what will happen if [the contract] goes anywhere else.\" \nThe ABC is seeking comment from the NT Department of Infrastructure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:16:15.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
