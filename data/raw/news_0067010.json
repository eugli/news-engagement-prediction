By Bill Bradley \nThe Trump administration issued an order this week that would repeal an Obama administration policy allowing transgender students to use the bathroom that corresponds to their sexual identities. \nIt’s a decision that could cause irreparable harm to trans students , so regardless of where he’s supposed to go to the bathroom, Stephen Colbert took a dump on President Donald Trump . \n“We should’ve seen this coming because if there’s one thing Trump is famous for, it’s telling people where to pee,” said Colbert, referring to the unsubstantiated (but hilarious) claim that Trump had prostitutes perform a “ golden shower ” in front of him. \nColbert continued ripping on the Trump administration, pointing out that the president was previously in favor of trans bathroom rights. When asked on the campaign trail if Caitlyn Jenner could use whatever bathroom she wanted at Trump Tower, the president said, “That is correct.” \n“Which is good,” added Colbert, “Because I’m guessing right now a lot of trans people would love to take a dump in Trump’s lobby.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST LGBTQ Groups React To Trump Revoking Trans Protections LGBTQ Groups React To Trump Revoking Trans Protections 1 14 The Los Angeles LGBT Center “All students deserve the dignity of being free from harassment and discrimination, including use of the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identities.
