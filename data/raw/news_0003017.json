Smith is joining \"General Hospital.\" The news was announced by Executive Producer Frank Valentini on social media. Smith played Nora Buchanan on One Life to Live from 1992 until the show's end in 2013. Her character on \"OLTL\" was a defense attorney and District Attorney, which may mean she is the new mystery D.A. who that is trying to nail Sonny Corinthos for the bomb placed in Julian Jerome's car that killed Sonny's son Morgan Corinthos. While on \"OTLT,\" Buchanan was left blind by a terrible accident, terrorized by a past client Todd Manning (Roger Howarth,Franco Baldwin), who attempted to rape her, and finally married her soul mate Bo Buchanan (Robert S. Woods) at wedding where Rock'N'Roll legend Little Richard performed. Recently ABC won the rights back to One Life to Live characters in a lawsuit involving the producing studio Prospect Park. \nIn the hilarious video posted by Valentini, a judge orders Nora Buchanan into her chamber's immediately. As Smith complies, she walks through the halls of the ABC studio and passes a shocked Rebecca Budig (Hayden Barnes), who gasps, \"That was Hillary B. Smith, she's coming to 'General Hosptial!'\" Rebecca Budig played Greenly Smythe on All My Children , the other show ABC has won the character rights back to in the same legal battle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T07:48:09.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
