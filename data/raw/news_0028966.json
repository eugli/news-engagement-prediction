With 3.5 million acre feet of water held behind the dam, floodwaters would pour through a huge section of Northern California. Residents closest to the dam would have just minu Patrick Gleason McClatchy \nCroyle said the lake should continue falling. The crippling damage done to the main spillway hasn’t worsened despite the relentless pounding it’s taken since Sunday evening. \n“It has been stable for four days,” Croyle said. “With the stability of the spillway, we’re able to maintain those high flows.” \nAt the current rate of decline, DWR hydrologist Maury Roos said the lake should be down to 3.15 million acre-feet when the next storm hits late Wednesday, leaving about 380,000 acre-feet of empty space. A Sacramento Bee analysis showed the same: The lake should be around 25 feet below the top of the reservoir when the rains begin falling. \n“That would be adequate for the size of the storm that’s forecast,” Roos said. “We’d like to have more.” \nIdeally, flood-control manuals say the lake should be down to 2.79 million acre-feet for this time of year, but that’s in anticipation of “a very large flood,” Roos said. “There’s nothing in the (weather) outlook that suggests we’re going to get that.” \nAlan Haynes, with the federal government’s California Nevada River Forecast, agreed that inflows to the lake should be manageable compared to the volumes that rushed in during last week’s storm. “They’re going to have inflows that are orders of magnitude less,” Haynes said. \nLast week’s storm came in wet and warm, with more rain and less snow than expected. Water flowing into the lake peaked at 191,000 cfs last Thursday. \nThis week’s weather, a series of three storm systems continuing through next Tuesday, should be different. The mountains above Lake Oroville should get only half as much precipitation, and more of it will fall as snow, said Michelle Mead, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Sacramento. Snow doesn’t run off into the reservoir as quickly as rain. \nLast week, “we saw inflows peaking at 190,000 cubic feet per second,” Mead said. “With this system you could expect half of that, if not lower.” \nCroyle, the DWR acting director, said the new storms will bring a “small increase in water surface elevation later this week.” Nonetheless, he said he thinks DWR can bring the lake down to 850 feet as early as Saturday or Sunday. That would translate into about 750,000 acre-feet of empty space, in line with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flood-control standards for this time of year. The rain could hamper those efforts. \nCroyle said DWR expects to draw down the lake even further, as well as press on with efforts to repair the hillside below the emergency spillway in case the lake fills up again and it has to be used. He said trucks and helicopters were bringing in 30 tons an hour worth of concrete rubble. \n“This is an aggressive, proactive attack to address the erosion concern,” he said. “There’s a lot of people, a lot of equipment, a lot of materials moving around, from the ground and from the air.” \nTuesday evening, federal emergency officials approved Gov. Jerry Brown’s request to provide financial assistance to help California respond to the emergency at Oroville Dam, as well as winter-storm damage elsewhere in the state. Repairs at the dam are expected to run in the hundreds of millions. \nWith the snowpack 45 percent above normal in the northern Sierra, and a heavy spring runoff coming, Croyle said he’s certain the emergency spillway could handle overflows from the lake if it has to. \n“I would not hesitate to use the emergency spillway,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:29:16.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
