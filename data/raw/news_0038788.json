Two taxis crashed on Park Street in the Sydney CBD, trapping a driver and injuring a female passenger. Picture: Bill Hearne   Crews worked for 40 minutes to free the driver. Picture: Bill Hearne   The driver suffered head and neck injuries. Picture: Bill Hearne   \nMs Garcia told The Daily Telegraph she had just finished work in the city and had taken the taxi to Pitt and Park St where she planned to get out and catch a bus home to Campbelltown. \nHad it been 10 seconds later, the taxi would have dropped her off. Ms Garcia said the two taxis were travelling side-by-side down Park St when they collided. \n“I was in the front passenger seat of the car. Both our taxi and the other taxi were driving next to each other at the same time down Park St. The other car was in our blind spot and they slowly collided. The other taxi has hit the left side,” she said. Police speak with passenger Cindy Garcia following the dramatic crash. Picture: Bill Hearne   Ms Garcia said she will never get in a cab again following the incident. Picture: Bill Hearne   \n“I was supposed to be dropped off right here. I was going to get the bus because I had just finished work. Five seconds more and I would have been out of the taxi. \n“A big chunk of my hair fell out. I don’t want to get in a taxi again now.” \nThe 53-year-old driver was trapped for 40 minutes before police rescue and firefighters removed him from the car. He was taken to St Vincent’s hospital in a stable condition. Crews grab parts of the taxis which sustained major damage in the collision. Picture: Bill Hearne   The 53-year-old driver was trapped for 40 minutes. Picture: Bill Hearne   \n21-year-old Anthony Barrow was nearby when the taxi flipped onto its roof. The former member of the Army pulled Ms Garcia out of the car and tried his best to rescue the driver. \n“I was waiting for the bus and saw the crash. While people were taking snapchats and videos, I ran up and unbuckled the woman’s seat belt and carried her out of the car and told her to calm down,” he said. One of the driver’s is breath-tested at the scene. Picture: Bill Hearne   \n“I ran around to the other side where the driver was, and had to push his seatbelt in. He was face down and the force was blocking his airway but I put him in the recovery position. I didn’t know if he was alive but I hope I saved his life. \n“He looked dead, and the lady was frightened.” \nAnother witness said he heard a tremendous bang, and saw the taxi tumble onto its roof. \n“We heard the bang and we turned around and watched the whole car flip. We saw the impact,” he said. \nThe Legion taxi had minor damage, and the driver was uninjured.
