Those guys are as competitive off the hardwood as they are on it. Nick Young, Dwyane Wade, Westbrook are never not exploring fashion trends, showing off splashy style moves , and perfecting pre-game tunnel swerve. The San Antonio Spurs forward is known for being a methodical, determined player, and noticeably soft-spoken, even a little shy in interviews. And unlike a lot of his fellow All-Stars, Kawhi prefers matching sweatsuits over, you know, actual suits for his own wardrobe. As we learned, that's all it really takes to make Kahwi Leonard actually smile: sweatsuits. More specifically, his new line of custom sweatsuits, which will debut later this year. The one he wore for our interview, an ultra-slim heather gray number complete with a zip-up hoodie design, was anything-but the bold menswear choice we're used to seeing flexed during All-Star Weekend . We spoke to Kawhi Leonard about the custom fit he was wearing, the style of his former teammate Tim Duncan , and more. \nTell me about the custom sweatsuit you're wearing. Who made it? \nThese two young guys out of New York. \nYou reached out to them? \nNah, we were looking for someone to make a sweatsuit with, and these two guys were young and driven, and wanted to start something new. Their names are Chris and Clayton Griggs. \nHow long did the custom take to make? \nIt was about a two or three month process. I just wanted to start off with something simple. Something that fit slim, felt good, and was made with good materials. \nDid you have fun picking out fabrics? Is that something that interests you? \nYeah, I mean, I had an idea of the type of terry I wanted to go with, so it wasn't too hard. It came naturally to me. \nWhere did the logo come from? \nIt was honestly just something I sketched out, to get the K, W, and L all in there. \nAre you a graphic designer on the side? \nNah [laughs]. It looked terrible at first but the guys made it look a lot better for the real one. \nHow many real suits do you own? \nMaybe just one. But I own some sport coats, too. \nDo you just try to avoid wearing a suit at all costs? \nI'm not trying to avoid it, but there just aren't too many things I attend that I need to wear a suit for. \nOff the court, what's your favorite pair of Jordans to wear? \nI like the wear the 1s, 3s, and 11s. \nIs there a specific colorway you like? \nI usually go with the retro colorways. Other than that I pull out something that I've personally designed for myself. \nBehind the scenes, did you guys make fun of Tim Duncan's style? \nFor sure. Just jokes. But we'd tell him he needs to get some smaller pants, get his hems shorter. \nIt's funny how his outfits from 1999 until his last season in 2016 didn't change much. \nRight. Some days he'd come in with some smaller pants or skinny jeans. Other than that he'd just go with what felt good to him. \nWhat's the most valuable lesson coach Popovich has given to you in terms of talking to the media? \nJust walk away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:43:15.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
