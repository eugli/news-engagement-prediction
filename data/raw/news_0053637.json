Keep smiling! Mourinho of all people melts hearts with touching message to Ranieri \nThe 24-year-old’s career has stalled since his controversial move to Bayern Munich four years ago and even a return to former club Borussia Dortmund has failed to spark a significant improvement in his form. \nGotze has scored just two goals in 20 appearances for Thomas Tuchel’s side this season and hasn’t featured since a 1-1 draw at Mainz almost a month ago. Gotze played the best football of his career under Klopp at Borussia Dortmund (Picture: Getty) \nLiverpool and Gotze’s former Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp have again been linked with a move for the talented playmaker this summer, but Matthaus believes a change of scenery and a totally fresh challenge would best suit the man who scored the winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final. \n‘First, leaving Munich and then leaving Dortmund? That can’t be the solution,’ Matthaus told Sport Bild. Liverpool fixtures \nLeicester (A) – Mon 27 Feb Arsenal (H) – Sat 4 Mar Burnley (H) – Sun 12 Mar Man City (A) – Sun 19 Mar Everton (H) – Sat 1 Apr Bournemouth (H) – Wed 5 Apr Stoke City (A) – Sat 8 Apr \n‘And where should he go? To be honest, and even if it might sound rude: If Gotze does not make it at Dortmund, he must go to China. \nHe won’t leave for Schalke, he does not fit at Leverkusen, Gladbach can’t afford Gotze,” he said.“Top clubs abroad no longer have him on their lists.
