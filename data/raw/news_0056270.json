Dorsa Derakhshani is not allowed to compete in the chess Grand Master comp because she wont wear a hijab, sad.

Sports in Iran and other parts of the Middle East have long been affected by the region's strict cultural norms and precarious political stance. \nLast year, American chess master Nazi Paikidze did not to compete in the chess world championships in Iran because of the country's requirement that she don a hijab. \n\"Some consider a hijab part of culture,\" Paikidze said at the time. \n\"But, I know that a lot of Iranian women are bravely protesting this forced law daily and risking a lot by doing so. That's why I will NOT wear a hijab and support women's oppression.\" \nThe hijab made different headlines earlier in the year, however, when US fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad became the first American to win a medal wearing the traditional headscarf. Muhammad earned a bronze in the team sabre event alongside hijab-less athletes Monica Aksamit, Dagmara Wozniak and Mariel Zagunis. \n\"I have to challenge this idea that in some way we don't belong because of our race or our religion,\" Muhammad, who is Saudi Arabian by heritage, said last year. \nShe added: \"Like within any religion, Muslims have conservatives, we have liberals, and we have everything in between. To paint all Muslims with one broad stroke can be frustrating.\" \n- The Washington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:05:43.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
