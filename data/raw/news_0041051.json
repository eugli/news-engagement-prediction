Photograph: Sven Hoppe/AP View more sharing options Agencies Thursday 16 February 2017 16.27 GMT \nArsène Wenger has said his future will probably be decided in March or April as he ponders whether to take up the offer of a contract extension or leave Arsenal at the end of the season. \nWenger was speaking to the German television station ZDF before Arsenal’s 5-1 Champions League humiliation by Bayern Munich on Wednesday, but details of the interview emerged only on Thursday. \nAsked when he would decide whether to continue next season, he said: “March, April probably.” Obsession over who can fill Arsène Wenger’s shoes obscures Arsenal’s real problems | Toby Moses Read more \nThe 67-year-old was stunned almost into silence after Wednesday’s game, answering only three questions in a press conference that lasted under three minutes. The manager is due to speak publicly again on Friday. \nArsenal’s next match is in the FA Cup at non-league Sutton United on Monday. The National League club’s manager, Paul Doswell, feels Wenger is being unfairly criticised but does not feel sorry for his counterpart. \n“Do I feel sympathy for him? No,” said Doswell, who watched Wednesday night’s Champions League match at home with his wife and son. “He is well schooled, and he has been in the job for 20 years. José Mourinho, Pep Guardiola, Wenger... I don’t feel sorry for them at all because they are in the mad world that is football.” \nDoswell will present Wenger with a £300 bottle of red wine, hand-picked by his brother. “Wenger is getting criticised – and I think wrongly – that he doesn’t have enough leaders in the dressing room, but he has still managed to qualify for the Champions League for the last 15 years,” Doswell said. \n“I would rather be in Arsenal’s position than Manchester United’s, who are playing in the Europa League. It is an open forum to criticise Arsenal and Arsène Wenger, but from our perspective we are just over the moon that they are coming here.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T18:31:12.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
