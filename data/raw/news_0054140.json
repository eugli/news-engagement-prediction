The IMF, however, said that the slowdown is temporary and the economy will get to expected growth rate of 8 per cent in next few years. \nPTI \n“Growth is projected to slow to 6.6% in FY2016/17, then rebound to 7.2% in FY2017/18, due to temporary disruptions, primarily to private consumption, caused by cash shortages,” mentions that IMF report, cited by PTI. \nIndia’s economy grew at 7.6% in 2015-16, and in the year 2016-17, the grew at 6.6% and this decline of one per cent has been caused by demonetisation. \nLow oil prices, tailwinds from a better monsoon and progress in resolving supply-side bottlenecks is likely to boost economic growth and ease in cash shortage will further help, the IMF said. \nPTI \nThe international body, in its reports, has supported India’s clamp down on illicit financial flows, but also noted the strain that has emerged from the currency exchange. \n“They called for action to quickly restore the availability of cash to avoid further payment disruptions and encouraged prudent monitoring of the potential side-effects of the initiative on financial stability and growth,” the report said. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi had announced demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes on November 8, 2016.
