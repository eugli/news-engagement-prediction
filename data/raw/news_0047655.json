The 34-year-old has played in 27 Tests taking 87 wickets, and picked up 75 scalps from 53 One-day Internationals (ODIs) and seven wickets from 10 Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T15:02:41.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
