Mike got extra points for cleaning snow off her car at the end of the night. \n\"I knew I liked him,\" Erin said. \"I was attracted to him right away. I was scared to like him as much as I did. It took me a few months to admit that I liked him.\" \nAfter that first date, the two spoke every day. They became a couple by St. Patrick's Day — a month later. \nAnd when Erin attempted to break up with him — twice — he wouldn't let her. \n\"The second time I broke up with him he called back and said, 'I'm not giving you any choice in the matter. We're still dating again,'\" Erin recalled. \nThe two live in Little Italy.

(Baltimore Sun video) \nThe proposal: Mike and Erin got engaged Dec. 5, 2015, during a family vacation in Aruba. \nAlthough the proposal wound up being a magical moment, it almost was ruined several times. \nIt started before the trip even took place. The two were riding in the car when a representative from Smyth Jewelers called Mike's phone, which happened to be on the car's Bluetooth mode. \n\"The voice said, 'This is Tammy from Smyth. Is this a good time to talk?' I said 'no' and I hung up the phone. It was very obvious,\" Mike recalled. \nMike wound up having Tammy draft a fake email saying she had made a mistake. He later showed that email to Erin. \n\"I was so excited but disappointed,\" Erin said. \nIn Aruba, Mike accidentally grabbed the wrong box the night he planned to propose to Erin. So he had to text his father to bring him the right ring, which ruined his opportunity to pop the question at dinner. \nTo add another twist, there was a mix-up with the reservation. The bartender wished the two a happy honeymoon when giving them two glasses of champagne. \nWhen Erin went to the bathroom, Mike asked the bartender, \"What the heck is going on?\" \nMike wound up proposing on the beach, and the minute he asked Erin, a huge fireworks display started near the water. \n\"It couldn't have been more perfect, but the whole night could not have been more bizarre,\" he said.
