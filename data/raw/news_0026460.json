The Japanese prime minister met with President Donald Trump Friday â the second in-person visit between Trump and another global leader. Overeager for the opportunity to speak to a world leader and not damage relations between that country and the United States in the process (cough, Malcolm Turnbull, cough), Trump shook Abe's hand rather forcefully. Abe's expression during and after the handshake incident speaks volumes. \nAbe is in the United States to smooth things over between Japan and the United States â to build a \"relationship of trust,\" as he told assembled reporters, according to the BBC.
