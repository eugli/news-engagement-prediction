(PTI file) \nRashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad Yadav has the tendency to make outrageous yet funny remarks against opposition leaders. His speeches in the Parliament often leave MPs in split. In recent times he has trained his guns against Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Lalu, who has been convicted for fodder scam, visited Rae Bareli to campaign for the Samajwadi Party- Congress alliance. During his speech, Lalu mocked PM Modi on a number of issues including demonetisation and the latter’s ‘achche din’ promise. Lalu said that Modi is like US President Donald Trump’s twin brother and both are dictators. He claimed that Modi would fall soon after BJP ’s defeat in Uttar Pradesh. \nCommenting on ‘achche din’, Lalu said, Modi talks about ‘achche din’ but ‘achche din’ was during the Congress rule. On demonetisation, Lalu compared the new Rs 2000 notes with ‘Churan ki Pudia’. While these remarks by the former Bihar CM tickled the funny bones of those present in his rally, Lalu made a shocking allegation against PM Modi and asked as to how Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s health deteriorated suddenly. “Atal ji is on bed. It should be probed as to who is responsible for his condition. What medicine was he given? Rajnath Singh couldn’t even keep his own secretary. This the condition they have been subjected by Modi,” Lalu said. \nLalu will campaign in Amethi and Rae Bareli for the alliance. The RJD chief also commented on expelled SP leader Amar Singh, saying the latter is experienced in breaking families apart. \nUttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav also took a dig at PM Modi today. “Gujarat CM is saying that I don’t know about donkeys of Gujarat. I didn’t want to talk about it further. But on Gujarat CM’s comment, I want to say openly, ‘I don’t want to know about donkeys of Gujarat. I just want to do ‘kaam ki baat”, he said at an election rally in Bahraich. \nThe fourth phase of UP assembly elections 2017 will take place tomorrow and the results would be announced on March 11 along with the results of four other states.
