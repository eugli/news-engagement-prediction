The vandal appeared briefly around 4:20am MT early Tuesday morning, wearing a mask to hide their identity, TMZ reports . The El Rey Museum began to remove the paint several hours later. As of Tuesday afternoon, the exhibition has been retouched and is back to streaming live . \nHe Will Not Divide Us was launched by LaBeouf on Inauguration Day in collaboration with artists Nastja Säde Rönkkö and Luke Turner at the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, New York. It was intended to stay in place for the duration of Trump's presidency—but after three weeks of violent outbursts and arrests, the exhibit was shut down at its original location. \nLaBeouf himself was arrested and charged last month with misdemeanor assault and a harassment violation after an altercation with a neo-Nazi at the site of the installation. \nIn an official statement regarding the closure of the installation, the museum cited \"serious public safety hazards\" and called the exhibit a \"flashpoint for violence.\" \nOn Feb. 18, the livestream reopened outside the El Rey Theater.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:24:44.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
