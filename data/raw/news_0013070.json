Related Migos: Young, Rich and Outrunning Trouble The stakes have never been higher for Atlanta's hottest rap group â€“ and they're not letting courtroom drama slow them down \nThe second album for the group that Donald Glover dubbed \"the Beatles of this generation\" at the Golden Globes sold 131,000 total copies in its first week on the charts, vastly improving on Migos' Number 17 debut for Yung Rich Nation in August 2015, Billboard reports . The album was boosted in large part by the single \"Bad and Boujee.\" \nAfter a slow start for new releases in 2017 as the Weeknd dominated the Billboard 200, this week's charts saw three new LPs in the Top Three and five in the Top 10: After Migos, country singer Brantley Gilbert's The Devil Don't Sleep entered at Number Two and 77,000 copies. Oakland R&B singer Kehlani bowed in at Number Three with SweetSexySavage . \nNow 61 at Number Five and Train's A Girl a Bottle a Boat at Number Eight were the other two newcomers to crack the Top 10 this week. \nThe Weeknd's Starboy dipped to Number Four after a string of Number Ones, selling another 51,000 streaming-assisted copies. The La La Land soundtrack (Number Six), Bruno Mars' 24K Magic (Seven), Post Malone's Stoney (Nine) and the Moana soundtrack (Number Ten) rounded out the returnees to the Top 10. \nNext week, Big Sean's I Decided is expected to debut at Number One, while Lady Gaga should see a nice sales boost following her Super Bowl halftime performance; the singer's digital sales jumped 1000 percent following the Houston gig, Billboard reported .
