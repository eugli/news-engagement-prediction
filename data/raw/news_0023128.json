Article continues below \nThat misfortune cost his dad a massive £1 million, who is understood to have enjoyed a regular flutter on the football. Lesson learned \nYoung Iker was just seven or eight at the time, and his father most likely learned the lesson not to ever put trust in a young boy, when the financial consequences are so significant, ever again. \nIn most countries that would be illegal, but at the time it was perfectly fine for the would-be Real Madrid 'keeper to go out and secure a bet for his dad. \nIt's hard to imagine the reaction of his father when he not only found out the bet wasn't placed but how much money he had missed out on, also. Casillas has repaid costly mistake \nNonetheless, it's safe to say that Casillas has repaid his father since then. The Spaniard enjoyed a very successful career at the Santiago Bernabeu and became one of the best players on the planet. \nBut his father undoubtedly didn't have guarantees on that happening back then. \nWhat has happened in the goalkeeper's career since then has been as much as a miracle as the £1 million bet his father should have won. \nCasillas has seen many world-class players pass through the Bernabeu, while he remained a key feature for almost all of his Los Blancos career. \nReal fans will certainly not forget him, and neither will his country, for which he helped them win the World Cup and back-to-back European Championships in 2008 and 2012. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
