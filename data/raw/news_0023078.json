How to save power: Turn off unnecessary residential lighting Set air conditioning temperature to 26 degrees Celsius or higher Minimise use of cooking equipment Consolidate refrigeration and turn off unnecessary fridges Avoid use of dishwashers, clothes dryers and vacuum cleaners Turn off domestic pool pumping, heating operations Avoid using TVs or computers for games Source: ACT Government \nYesterday Canberrans faced the hottest maximum temperature of any capital city when the mercury reached 41C at about 5:20pm . \nThere is no relief in sight today however, with the temperature again set to reach 41C as a heatwave sweeps the country. \nIf temperatures climb beyond that it could become the city's hottest day ever â€” a record not broken since 1968 when it reached 42.2C at the airport. \nThe hot conditions yesterday prompted concerns about power supplies, with large consumers including the airport, the National Capital Authority and Canberra's Data Centre asked to use generators. \nToday, as many more people are away from air-conditioned offices, power supplier Actew AGL said the need for forced outages was less likely. \nBut general manager of energy networks Stephen Devlin was still urging Canberrans to do their bit to ease pressure on the grid.
