Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com \nMike Yeo was aware going into his Blues’ debut Thursday against Toronto that a coaching change in the NHL typically gives the team a jolt. \nBut a day after taking over for Ken Hitchcock, Yeo wasn’t taking for granted what the crowd of 19,258 at Scottrade Center was expecting. In a talk with the players, he told them they can’t expect it to happen, they had to make it happen. \nWho knows how long this surge will last, but on the night that Bobby Plager’s No. 5 was retired to the rafters, the Blues fittingly finished with five goals in a 5-1 triumph over Toronto. \n“When something like this happens, quite often it’s a jolt to the team,” Yeo said. “It gives everybody a chance to dig in and look at themselves and figure out what they can do better — and we got that tonight.” \nPaul Stastny had two of the goals, while Vladimir Tarasenko, Alexander Steen and Colton Parayko accounted for one apiece, and Jake Allen turned in 26 saves for the win, his first since the Winter Classic. \n“I felt good,” Allen said. “It’s another step for me. I’ve still got more to give. Tuesday was a step. Today was another step, tomorrow when I get back on the ice again it’s another step there.” \n“I can’t say why,” Yeo said, “but I felt real confident that Jake was going to have a real strong game today. I kind of talked to him before the game and he just seemed real loose and ready to go. I thought he was outstanding. I really thought that he was outstanding.” \nJust 24 hours earlier, Blues general manager Doug Armstrong accused the club of being made up of “independent contractors,” in essence saying some were more interested in their individual success than team success. \nInteresting, during Plager’s rousing remarks during the pre-game ceremony, he mentioned that his career was shaped by playing for the Blue Note crest on the front of the sweater and not the name on the back. The players were standing a mere 50 feet away and seemed to soak up the message. \n“Obviously we never want to be individuals, we want to become a team and play for the crest because at the end of the day that’s all that we’re wearing together,” Parayko said. \nActually, Plager referenced it more than once. \n“I like that he said it twice in case somebody didn’t hear it the first time,” Yeo said. “There’s a guy who has given his heart and soul to the organization for 50 years. I’m glad that all of our guys got to be out there for it and to witness that and to hear those words. I know it’s something that we’ve all heard before, but when a guy like Bobby is up there and speaks with the passion that he does about what it means to be a Blue, that was special and I think that had an effect on our group for sure.” \nAs expected with Wednesday’s coaching change, the Blues had some jump early Thursday. Allen kept the club in the game early, but couldn’t keep the Maple Leafs off the board the entire first period. \nMitch Marner scored his 13th goal of the year to give Toronto a 1-0 lead with 5:36 remaining in the first period. \nThe Blues, though, bounced back with Steen’s 10th goal of the season. Steen’s sixth goal in his last nine games went through the legs of three Maple Leafs, including goalie Frederik Andersen, and tied the score at 1-1 with 2:02 left in the first period. \nWith a game that started close to 8:30, it was getting late by the second period. \n“We had to keep ourselves up,” Stastny said. “We’re not 18-19 like some of the guys on our team, so some of us had to keep that energy within ourselves.” \nThe Blues stayed awake, breaking the game open with three goals in the second period, including a pair 35 seconds apart. \nStastny’s 13th of the season gave the team a 2-1 lead just 6:27 into the period. A strong forecheck by David Perron allowed Steen to make a pass in front, and the puck ricocheted off Toronto's Auston Matthews and onto the stick of Stastny for his first of the game. \nTarasenko quickly followed with his 23rd of the season for a 3-1 lead just 7:02 into the period. He executed his patented cut move to the center of the ice, twisting up defenseman Morgan Rielly, and then ripped a wrist shot past Andersen. \nThe Blues had three goals on 15 shots at that point and added another on Parayko’s fourth goal of the season, on the power play, for a 4-1 lead with 8:58 left in the second period. He took a pass from Alex Pietrangelo and unleashed another one of his bombs, this time from just 29 feet. \n\"They keep giving me too much time over there,\" Parayko said. \"It's a great play by (my teammates), they're doing all the hard work, and I just get the puck in the slot, so lucky for me.\" \nThe Blues had four goals, but Plager didn't wear No. 4. \n“Then I think it because it’s a jersey retirement night, those come around once every 10 years if a franchise is lucky, somewhere in the back of your mind you’re thinking if you get the win, it would be cool to try to get five goals, something that the Plager family will always remember,” Stastny said. \nIt was Stastny who scored it in the third period, his second of the game and 14th of the season. After another blast by Parayko, Stastny lunged at the rebound and knocked it in off both posts, giving both Stastny and Parayko three points in the game. \nSo the Blues got Plager a fifth goal and Yeo his first coaching victory with the Blues. \n“I think a new coach, I think we had a new sense of urgency, a new life kicked into us,” Stastny said. “We wanted to just compete out there. If we would’ve lost, I think we just wanted to have a better attitude than we’ve had in the past. But we wanted to get that win under ‘Yeosie.’” \nIt’s tradition that players give the coach a keepsake puck after his first win and the Blues kept with that tradition. \n“I got a puck, yes, and the guys also criticized my tie,” Yeo said. “I thought it was pretty good, but apparently it’s not.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:41:01.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
