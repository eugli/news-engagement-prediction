Newly single Rob Kardashian shared his \"favorite\" photo of his baby daughter , Dream Kardashian, on Monday. In the photo, Dream -- and all of her gorgeous hair -- is cuddled up on Rob's shoulder. The pair look completely at peace (and like twins!), so it's no wonder the photo is so near and dear to Rob's heart. \nRob originally shared the adorable photo about two months ago, but this time around, he captioned the shot, \"My favorite pic of us,\" along with two blue heart emojis. So sweet. A post shared by ROBERT KARDASHIAN (@robkardashian) on Feb 20, 2017 at 8:52am PST \nDream is one cute baby, and despite the fact that her parents don't seem to get along very well, she seems very loved by both of them. \nMore from CafeMom: 18 of Rob Kardashian & Blac Chyna's Cutest Moments Together \nAfter a tumultuous couple of months, it seems like, as of last week, Rob and his fianc√© Blac Chyna have broken up for good. As opposed to their usual breakups , there haven't been any digs thrown at each other on social media this time around; they both just seem done. \"This breakup feels more real because both of them are very calm,\" a source told Us Weekly . \"Rob and Chyna haven't really been together since Christmas, not really properly.\" \nHopefully, both Rob and Chyna will be able to stay mature throughout their breakup, and will sort things out with Dream's best interest at heart. The pair have tried (and tried!) to make things work. It's obvious that they're just not meant to be. \nMore from CafeMom: 18 of Rob Kardashian & Blac Chyna's Cutest Moments Together \nWhen Chyna first came into Rob's life, she appeared to be a positive influence. Over time, that's seemed to have changed, but one thing is certain: Rob is head over heels for his daughter and he wants to do right by her. \nDream may not have the most conventional upbringing in the world, but without question, she will be loved to pieces by so many people. And what's more important than that?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:27:37.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
