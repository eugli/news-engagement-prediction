Virgin Australia had previously operated the flights itself but shifted them to Tigerair in an attempt to restore its international division to profitability.\nThe budget subsidiary of Virgin Australia had been expected to restart flights to the island on Friday, but on Thursday evening it said final approvals from Indonesia had not been received.\n\"Providing a reliable, low-cost service is critical for Tigerair Australia and our customers, and therefore our only option is to withdraw from flying to Bali altogether,\" Tigerair Chief Executive Rob Sharp said in a statement.\nCustomers who had booked tickets to Bali will receive a full refund, the airline said.\nBali is an Indonesian holiday island known for its beaches and rice paddies, and is a popular holiday destination for Australian tourists. Tigerair usually carries hundreds of passengers to Bali each day from Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth.\n\n- Reuters/am\nEmail More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:54:12.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
