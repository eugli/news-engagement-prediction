Experts hope Trappist-1 could harbour intelligent life \nDue to the surface of the blazing inferno, no spaceship can safely land on the surface, but the Solar Plus will get within 4 million miles of the Sun. \nTo deal with the searing heat even at that distance, the spaceship will have to be fitted with a 4.5 inch thick carbon shield and a number of other safety measures. \nThe spacecraft will be unmanned, but NASA hope to develop a spacecraft capable of transporting a human to the same distance.
