Rahane replaces Karun Nair in the playing XI. As usual Virat Kohli opts 6-5 policy. \"Great moment for Bangladesh cricket\", said Rahim. \nHaving started playing Test cricket in 2000, Bangladesh is playing its first Test in India. \nBangladesh, having won a Test against England, will not be a pushover as it has shown its skills in subcontinental pitches. On the other hand, Team India will try to score another victory. Having won eight out of nine Test matches, India will be keen to score another victory. \nThis Test will also be a practice match for India as they will be facing Australia in a four-Test series later in February. \nThe pitch seems to be a batting wicket and the spinners will play a crucial role later in the match i.e. from third day. A tinge of green but the captain wins the toss will opt to bat. \nThe teams \nIndia \nMurali Vijay, KL Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli (captain), Ajinkya Rahane, Wriddhiman Saha (wicket-keeper), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Ishand Sharma \nBangladesh \nTamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mominul Haque, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim (captain and wicket-keeper), Sabbir Rahman, Mehedi Hasan Miraz, Taijul Islam, Taskin Ahmed, Kamrul Islam Rabbi", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T15:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T11:18:27.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
