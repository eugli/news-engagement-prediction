Spears. \nAs you would expect, a number of suitors would be interested in Williams’ duties, even though his recent production and overall health has waned in recent years. \nBut, Stein followed up his earlier tweet with this update. \nIt appears as though Williams has a destination in mind: Cleveland. \nNow it seems like only a matter of time and logistics before Williams takes the court for the defending champions. \nWhile Kevin Love and JR Smith are both nursing injuries, the thought it that they’ll be a force when the Playoffs roll around yet again. \nHaving Williams in the backcourt when Irving needs a breather will only add to their chances of winning another title.
