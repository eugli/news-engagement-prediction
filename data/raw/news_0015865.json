Publishers got themselves in this predicament. \nFor years, web publishers pushed ever-more annoying advertisements to their readers. It started with Flash banner advertisements — a means of video delivery so insecure Adobe won’t even use it anymore — and evolved into full-screen pop-ups, auto-playing audio (or video), and an attempt to fill every unused pixel of whitespace with as many ads as possible. \nAnd don’t get me started on tracking cookies. Cookies are a necessity for key site information like how long people read certain articles, how they found your page, and how often they come back, but publishers are no so reliant on them they’re used to serve ads for products you viewed months earlier, and to relay sensitive data back to anyone with a big enough checkbook to buy it. \nThrough the mistakes of a few, all are now positioned to suffer until we can come up with a happy medium.
