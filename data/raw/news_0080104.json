He called it “Nae Slappin.” He had it copyrighted two years later.\nAfter recording the song on a demo tape in 1989, Rose circulated it through his agent to several senior executives at Island Records, the suit said.\nRose’s song was “played and repeatedly listened to in the Island Records office,” the suit said.\nBritish songwriter and composer Paul Rose says he never received credit for \"The Fly,\" a song on \"Achtung Baby.\" (YouTube via Paul Rose) U2 was also signed by Island Records in 1989 and the band was “often in the Island Records offices” and Bono and The Edge used the company’s recording studio, the suit said.\nIn 1990, U2 began recording sessions for “Achtung Baby,” the suit said. The record was a total departure from the band’s prior style — exploring a dark and edgy sound to capture a new audience.\nU2 released “The Fly” as the first single on Oct. 21, 1991 — roughly a monthly before “Achtung Baby” dropped.\nThe song’s “dance beats, distorted vocals and hard industrial edge sounded nothing like typical U2” — and that’s because Rose wrote it, the suit said.\nThe key elements of “The Fly” — the guitar hook and the distinctive guitar solo and the percussive beats — are nearly identical to “Nae Slappin,” court papers said.\n“The Fly” copied and incorporated substantial, distinct, important and recognizable portions of Plaitiff’s work,” Rose’s suit said.\n“An ordinary lay observer would reasonably find that ... infringement has occurred. Indeed, the similarities .... are so strikingly similar that independent creation is precluded,” the suit concluded.\nNo reason is given for Rose’s 25-year delay in filing his claim, but the suit notes he’s had no recourse because “the right of attribution is not statutorily recognized.”\nIsland Records and U2 could not be immediately reached for comment.\nSend a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:47:55.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
