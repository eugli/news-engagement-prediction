Three protesters chained themselves to one of the vehicles, which had a banner reading: “No new runways”.\nBA boss shocked to find out that third Heathrow runway will raze his HQ Read more \nThe drivers of two vehicles were arrested for obstructing a highway by about 9.30am, according to the Metropolitan police, and their vehicles had been removed. But the third car remained in place. \nA contra-flow was in place to allow traffic to move through the blocked tunnel but police warned travellers delays were possible. Long tailbacks on the M4 eased but the road remained busy, the BBC Radio London traffic bulletin warned.\nA four-month public consultation into the decision to open a third runway at Heathrow is under way. Rising Up, which staged a similar protest last November , says if the runway goes ahead it will allow an extra 250,000 flights a year, causing carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to the entire output of Kenya. \nSimon Bramwell, one of the activists involved in Tuesday’s action, said in a statement released by Rising Up that he also participated in November’s protests. He said: “I am breaking conditions imposed on me by the courts, following road blockades in November, but the government is not listening to the science or to our concerns. They have left us with no alternative but to keep taking action. We will not stop until plans to build another runway are fully and finally shut down.”\nA Rising Up spokesman told the Guardian: “History has shown that unless we can disrupt the status quo, the powers that be will say the right thing and kick doing the right thing down the road for as long as they can.”\nHe added: “The inconvenience of some people missing their flights is absolutely nothing compared to the inconvenience of your country being flattened by a typhoon.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:00:26.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
