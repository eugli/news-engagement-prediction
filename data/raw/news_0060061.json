That is the spirit of Detroit —no choice but to have some resolve and go forward.” \nThe city’s restaurant community reacted quickly to the news. A regular patron set up a GoFundMe page—reverently titled “ The Mothership Will Fly Again ,” as Greenhill and business partner Courtney Henriette have dubbed their first brick-and-mortar location of Katoi the mothership. Nearby Corktown restaurants, some of which hosted Katoi when it was just a pop-up, have held fundraisers. And restaurants in Detroit and across the country have offered one-night kitchen takeovers where proceeds from the dinner go directly to the rebuild. Altogether, they've raised over $20,000 for Katoi. \n“The community has been really supportive. It’s been nothing short of amazing,” Greenhill says. “We’ll be back better than ever hopefully.” \nNow until the restaurant goes into construction, Greenhill is going back to square one, looking for a new kitchen space, cleaning the old food truck and readying his team for the road again. These pop-ups put Katoi on the map with their vibrant thrice-cooked sweet potatoes and khao soi. \n“Katoi didn’t start as a restaurant, but a food truck and a pop-up. It’s been in so many different forms, so it’s not just a building,” he says. “There is never an option to give up on it. This is what we do and we got to find a way to do it again.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T13:31:12.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
