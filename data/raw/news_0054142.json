Singing her new track Chained to the Rhythm with Bob Marley 's grandson Skip Marley , the American star failed to notice that one of her performers - dressed in a huge white house costume - had accidentally taken a tumble off stage during the lively routine. The hilarious moment was captured on camera by audience member Reece Jordan Doonan‏ who shared it on Twitter with the caption: \"OH MY GOD! Demolition on stage for Katy Perry.\" OH MY GOD!

Their similarity to the world leaders did not go unnoticed by viewers, who flocked to social media. One wrote: \"I love that Katy Perry's #BRITs performance featured giant skeleton monsters of Trump & May.\" Another said: \"Even without the political statement, Katy Perry was the best thing about the Brits last night.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:04:49.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
