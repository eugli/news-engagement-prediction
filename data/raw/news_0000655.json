Since the year 2000, Sir Walter Wally has predicted the end of winter correctly 82 percent of the time. \nDespite the presence of Sir Walter's shadow, though, it's going to stay cold for a couple more days. \n\"I can tell you, though, the official forecast is for a cold weekend and then spring weather for much of next week,\" Gardner said.
