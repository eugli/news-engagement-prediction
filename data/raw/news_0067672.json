'Flawed and incomplete assessments' meant Shi-Anne's death could not have been predicted. Shi-Anne was 'almost invisible' to professionals after only a small amount of information was provided from one visit from a health visitor and a mention by education in pre-school. Concerns should have been recognised and acted on, if intervention had been made earlier through home visits, that should have taken place. The author of the report said 'it seems to have become practice for Birmingham City Council to regard a placement with an extended family member or a 'connected person' as being preferable to adoption irrespective of the circumstances of the child'. Later suggesting these judgements also require Family Court Judges. Shi-Anne's voice was regularly missed, with too much focus on her carer. The fact the decision had been accepted at the Family Court, suggests they are less likely to challenge the Local Authority, after finding gaps in the assessments. There was no firm evidence that Kandyce's parenting could be compromised, but there are risk factors such as historical episodes of domestic abuse and being a single mother with 4 children. Recognising these factors, should have led to an assessment. Kandyce Downer was sentenced to life in prison and must serve a minimum period of 18 years for murdering Shi-Anne.\nAfter Shi-Anne's death Birmingham City Council reviewed their procedures and provided assurances to the review that they are making necessary improvements.\n Birmingham West Midlands", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:06:46.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
