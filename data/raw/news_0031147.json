China’s large gender gap is causing problems for the country’s men, especially poorer, rural ones. Credit Roman Pilipey/European Pressphoto Agency SHANGHAI — If you’re a “single dog,” a “bare branch,” a “leftover man” or a “leftover woman” — all monikers for unmarried Chinese — you may find Valentine’s Day particularly trying. Judging by the numbers, quite a few of the long faces on Tuesday should belong to men. That’s because China ’s gender gap remains huge. There were 33.59 million more men than women in China in 2016, according to figures from the country’s National Bureau of Statistics that were issued last month, and 48.78 percent of China’s 1.38 billion people are female, compared with a global average of 49.55 percent . For men, especially those lower on the socioeconomic ladder, marriage can be hard to attain. The reasons for the gap are well known: a traditional preference for boys, compounded by the “one child” policy instituted in 1979 that led millions of couples to abort female fetuses. Worried by one of the world’s lowest fertility rates , the government changed the policy last year to permit all couples to have two children. On Valentine’s Day, “I see a lot of stressed-out people around for different reasons,” said Li Xuan , a psychology professor at N.Y.U. Shanghai who studies fatherhood and relationships. “They’re going to see a phenomenon that is made to seem universal,” Ms. Li said. “It’s not a nice feeling. A lot of the consumerist and entertainment activities are so geared toward couples that you kind of get a bit of hurt everywhere in the big cities in China.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Yet the percentage of people who are married in China is higher than in surrounding, more economically developed Asian societies such as Japan and Singapore, and some Western nations, Ms. Li said on Monday, presenting a paper titled “The Myth of Singlehood” at the university’s spacious premises in the Pudong business district. According to 2010 national census data, about 24.7 percent of Chinese men and 18.5 percent of women above the age of 15 have never been married, Ms. Li said. The government regularly says that China has 200 million singletons and frets in the state news media over who will care for them in their old age without a family of their own. In China, elder care is the legal responsibility of adult children. By contrast, Ms. Li said, figures for Japan show 31.3 percent and 22.9 percent of people in comparable categories have not married, Ms. Li said.

So how serious is the plight of China’s “single dogs,” as unmarried men are jokingly called? “I would not say it’s not serious, because in China even the smallest fraction of the population is thousands and thousands of people, and of course each individual is important,” Ms. Li said. “But I don’t think it’s as catastrophic as we hear in the media .” Underlying the panic is a conservative worldview, she said. “I think people are anxious about deviance from the traditional family ideal,” she said. “Chinese culture believes that everything rests on the family. If the family collapses, it’s like the world is over, so now the family seems to be collapsing, and I guess that maybe pushes the button a little more among Chinese people.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
