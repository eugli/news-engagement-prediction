Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nGillard honoured her part of the bargain, but no asylum seekers were sent from Australia to Malaysia because of Coalition obstruction, not once, but twice. Tony Abbott, who led that obstruction, has since conceded that this was a mistake . \nTurnbull announced at the Obama refuge summit last September that Australia would participate in the US-led program to resettle Central American refugees currently in a resettlement centre in Costa Rica. \nThe same day, I wrote that, if Turnbull's offer to help the United States was not the start of a solution for those on Nauru and Manus Island, it should be . \n\"There is a logical quid pro quo here: that if Australia helps the US by resettling refugees being held in Latin America, they should do the same for Australia by resettling refugees detained on tiny islands,\" I wrote. \nWhen Turnbull was asked if the deal could amount to a people swap agreement, he was emphatic. \"The announcement today is not connected to any other arrangements,\" he told reporters. \nThis was repeated many times, including by Dutton and Morrison. \nBut not any more. To Bolt, Dutton also said he would not use the term \"people swap\" to describe the arrangement, but added that he had no \"problem with the characterisation\". \nHe then made the link crystal clear by saying Australia would not take anyone from Costa Rica \"until we had assurances that people were to go off Nauru and Manus\". If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duckâ€¦ \nDutton also predicted that the first transfers from Nauru and Manus to the United States would take place in \"the next couple of months\", though this would seem a wildly optimistic assessment. \nEven before Trump declared that transfers would be subjected to \"extreme vetting\", it was unlikely that any transfers would take place before May. \nJulie Bishop has since reverted to script, declining to endorse any connection between the arrangements and expressing confidence that the agreement to resettle up to 1250 of the more than 2000 on Nauru and Manus is progressing well. \nBut words, once said, can't be unsaid. \nDutton can only hope Trump is too busy to have noticed or doesn't care.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:24:02.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
