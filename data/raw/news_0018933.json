Image copyright Reuters Image caption Volunteers have been trying to refloat the surviving whales Image copyright Reuters Image caption Farewell Spit often sees whale strandings \nThe conservation department said it had received a report about a possible stranding on Thursday night, but did not launch the rescue operation until Friday morning as it was too dangerous to attempt a rescue in the dark, reported the New Zealand Herald. \nAndrew Lamason, the departments regional manager, said it was one of the largest mass beachings recorded in New Zealand. \nNew Zealand marine mammal charity Project Jonah. which is leading efforts to save the whales said a total of 416 whales were stranded. \nIt said the surviving whales are \"being kept cool, calm and comfortable\" by medics and members of the public. \nSome of the refloated whales tried to swim back to shore, and the human chain was trying to herd them out to deeper waters, said volunteer Ana Wiles. \nShe told news outlet Stuff that there were \"so many fins in the air, no breathing\". \n\"We managed to float quite a few whales off and there were an awful lot of dead ones in the shallows so it was really, really sad.\" \n\"One of the nicest things was we managed to float off a couple [of whales] and they had babies and the babies were following,\" Ms Wiles added. \nNew Zealand has one of the highest stranding rates in the world, with about 300 dolphins and whales ending up on beaches every year, according to Project Jonah. . \nMany of these incidents happen at Farewell Spit. Experts say its shallow waters seems to confuse whales and hinder their ability to navigate. \nIn February 2015 about 200 whales beached themselves at the same location, of which at least half died.
