But that hasn't stopped him from worrying about the real problems facing this country, like NBC's \"Saturday Night Live.\" \nPresident Donald Trump was reportedly rattled last week by Melissa McCarthy’s inspired impersonation of White House press secretary Sean Spicer on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.” But it ends up that there’s another impression that’s started to bother him even more, and it’s not even Alec Baldwin’s Trump. \nThe leader of the free world ― who is tasked with solving problems including but not limited to the economy, the educational system and the ongoing crises in the Middle East ― is “especially upset” that “SNL” has started to depict chief strategist Stephen Bannon as a Grim Reaper who actually runs the country while Trump sits at a tiny desk playing with children’s toys, the Washington Post reports. YouTube We are including this GIF to provide an example of the Steve Bannon impression on “SNL” and definitely not in the hope of further angering the president. \nPerhaps you are wondering, why is the leader of the free world spending so much of his time worrying about how he and his administration are depicted on a weekly late-night comedy showcase? Unfortunately, we don’t have that answer for you. \nWhat we can tell you is that the show’s ratings are the highest they have been in more than two decades , and that Saturday’s show, which was hosted by Baldwin, was its highest rated show in six years . \nIn recent months, Trump has called the show “ boring ,” “ unfunny ,” “ unwatchable ” and “ terrible. ” But for some reason, it seems that he has continued to watch it nonetheless. \nSo considering that, and considering the respect we have for the office of the presidency, let us humbly suggest that the writers of the show do everything they can to make sure “Veep” star Tony Hale does not, under any circumstances, join the show this Saturday to play Trump’s senior advisor, Stephen Miller. \nThat would just upset the president even more.
