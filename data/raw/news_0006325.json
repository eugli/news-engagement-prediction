There are more than 16 million different train fares, many of which nobody buys. This also makes it more difficult to give passengers the right, simple options on ticket machines.\n“Working with government, we’re determined to overhaul the system to cut out red-tape, jargon and complication to make it easier for customers to buy fares they can trust, including from ticket machines.”\nIf the pilot scheme is rolled out across the network is will mean the end of decades-old government rules covering rail fares, which were originally intended to protect customers but were introduced before the internet and online booking and have prevented train companies from being more flexible in offering tickets that customers want.\nThe RDG has also issued a ten point Ticket Vending Machine improvement plan for rail operators to make ticket vending machines easier to use and the information printed on tickets easier to understand.\nRail fares T his will include making passengers aware that a cheaper ticket is available for the same journey, meaning, according to the RPG, that “customers never unknowingly pay more for a ticket than they needed”.\nThe planned changes were welcomed by the independent watchdog Transport Focus.\nAnthony Smith, its chief executive, said: \"What’s clear from our research is that passengers find the ticketing system far too complex. The presence of cheaper fares that are 'hidden' in the system really damages trust between passengers and train companies.\n“These trials are a welcome step in providing clearer information on ticket restrictions and greater transparency on price. We will be monitoring these measures to make sure passengers are getting a better deal.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T09:21:46.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
