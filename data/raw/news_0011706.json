PHOTO | BONIFACE NYAGA By BONIFACE NYAGA \nKenyan gospel singer Mercy Masika started the year on a high with the release of her new collabo with Tanzanian gospel artiste Angel Bernard. \nWhen pair decided to do the ‘ Huyu Yesu ‘ song they really did not know what they were getting into. \n“My producer is the one who introduced us. We had actually never met before we begun recording but we just clicked,” Mercy explained to Nairobi News . \n“It was such a divine connection, it is such a rear thing to find someone that you connect with someone on so many levels.” \nThe song has been well received across the two East African countries. \nOn her first trip to Kenya since the release of the song, Angel Bernard gave an exclusive interview to Nairobi News. \nShe revealed: “People love Mercy back at home, so it’s no wonder that the song is doing very well. I even got a message from a fan who wanted to committed suicide on December 31 when the song came out. She was going through a tough situation and she was planning to kill herself until she watched our song on YouTube.” Latest Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T14:51:48.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
