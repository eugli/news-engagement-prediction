Put them together and you have a little-known sport that should be a big hit in the province. \nIt’s called Skijoring. It involves getting pulled behind a horse on skis or a snowboard. \nThe comes from Norway, where it translates to “ski driving.” Combining cross-country skiing and dog sledding was once a popular mode of transportation in Scandinavian countries. \nIn Alberta, it’s all about the horse power. Story continues below \nThe activity is something that’s been on ranches and farms across the province for years, there just wasn’t necessarily a name for it. \n“When we were kids, you have a horse, you have a rope, you have a toboggan and you just do it,” Skijoring organizer Sam Mitchell explained. \n“I’ve been snowboarding for 10 years, but this is the first time we’ve done this,” Skijoring newcomer Graham Mitchell said. “The difference is significant. One way you’re just going downhill and the other way you’re being pulled by an extremely fast horse.” \nThis weekend, the Calgary Polo Club is hosting an introduction to the high-paced sport with a little twist. \nIt’s called Skijordue. \n“We think the cheese is fun, and fast cheese is even more fun,” Mitchell said. \nThey will have three different events: obstacles, a timed event, long jump and sprints. And, of course, fondue. \nIt’s all in support of Prairie Sky Equine Assisted Therapy , a program that supports adults and children with physical, mental, social and emotional disabilities. \nSkijordue will be held Saturday, Feb. 11 at the Calgary Polo Club. \nFor more information, go to skijor.ca . © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:39:44.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
