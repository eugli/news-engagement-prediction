DAVID WALKER/FAIRFAX NZ \nAn aerial image of the Christchurch Adventure Park shows the destruction caused by the fires. \nPark spokeswoman Anne Newman said the drone use was \"incredibly concerning and frustrating\". \n\"It is . . . jeopardising the safety of the pilots. I know people want to see what has happened but it is seriously jeopardising the work of the fire services,\" she said. \nFire Service personnel were using a drone for thermal and infrared imaging on Tuesday evening, but a Civil Defence spokeswoman said there had been reports of other drones being used. STACY SQUIRES/FAIRFAX NZ \nPolice check residents' photo IDs at the cordon on Hoon Hay Valley Rd. \n\"Flying drones in this area illegally will be taken very seriously, as it compromises critical aerial firefighting operations and safety.\" \nThe Port Hill fires, which started on February 13, ripped through about 2075 hectares, forcing 450 houses to be evacuated, destroying nine homes and partially damaging two. \nThe fire was contained ahead of the adventure park's village and base station, but there was significant damage to the lift and rest of the park, Newman said. \n\"We are unable to assess the extent of the damage or how long it will take until the fires are out.\" Ad Feedback \nFirefighters made good progress in other parts of the Port Hills on Wednesday and were able to pull back from the Worsleys area, though warned people needed to stay vigilant in case of flare ups. \nBarriers were removed from Rapaki Track and tracks in Mt Vernon Farm Park on Wednesday afternoon, and residents from 51 homes on Worsleys Rd were allowed to return home in the morning.
