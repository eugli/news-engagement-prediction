The “Yeah Boy” singer tells Self all the things that make her home on wheels tour ready! “My first artist bus was Jason Aldean’s old bus, with deer antlers over the lights and cowhide on the back of the couches,” she says. “It was such an absolute dude bus. The one I’m in now is more of a girl bus, so I have a bedroom in the back and the right lighting over the mirror, which makes getting ready for shows so much easier.” \nPosted February 14, 2017 \nIn addition to makeup and the perfect lighting, healthy is also a tour-bus must have.“It took a while to learn to eat healthy on road,” she adds. “It’s really hard. Really, really hard. But on the bus, I can use the stove top in the morning to make a veggie scramble. And have lots and lots and lots of coffee. I try to have protein for dinner so I have energy for the show.”Catch Kelsea with TR on the first date of the Home Team Tour Wednesday (2/23) in Michigan.
