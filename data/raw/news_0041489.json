The wind is just going nuts.\"\n\"At one point the wind was so strong I'm surprised it didn't blow my windows out,\" retiree Phoenix Hocking said in a Facebook message from Carpinteria. \"I now have a pond in my patio. And my dog is starting to grow flippers so he can go out and do his business.\"\nUsing ropes and inflatable boats, firefighters rescued seven people and two dogs from the Sepulveda basin, a recreation and flood-control area along the Los Angeles River. One person was taken to a hospital with a non-life- threatening injury.\nMudslides and flooding partially closed a section of freeway and the Pacific Coast Highway in beach areas.\nCalifornia storms The storm took aim at Southern California but also spread precipitation north into the San Joaquin Valley and up to San Francisco. It was not expected to bring significant rain in the far north where damage to spillways of the Lake Oroville dam forced evacuation of 188,000 people last weekend.\nThe National Weather Service said it could end up being the strongest storm to hit Southern California since January 1995.\nRain and wind wiped out play in golf's Genesis Open at the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles, where a eucalyptus tree cracked. Elsewhere in the city a tree brought down power lines as it fell on a car, and a person was hospitalized for possible electric shock, the Fire Department said.\nBy mid-afternoon, hundreds of trees and dozens of power lines had toppled in the Los Angeles area.\nA 75-foot tree fell onto an apartment building near the University of California, Los Angeles, narrowly missing someone who was in bed, fire officials said.

Up the coast, evacuations were urged for parts of Camarillo Springs in Ventura County and around an 11½-square-mile burn scar west of Santa Barbara.\n\"This is, by far, the biggest storm we've had in a long time,\" said Johnson, the UCSB adviser. \"Might not be the best weekend to be a tourist in Santa Barbara.\"\nCal Poly, the state university in San Luis Obispo, was keeping an eye on an unstable hillside near a dormitory housing 275 students. A protective barrier was set up and some trees were removed, but students were told to be ready to evacuate.\nSanta Anita Park near Pasadena canceled all its horse races Friday.\nPasadena canceled Saturday's annual Black History Month parade, citing public safety concerns, including possible lightning strikes.\nIn Northern California, officials monitoring the stricken Oroville Dam on the Feather River said they were confident the reservoir would handle any runoff from expected storms because ongoing releases have been lowering the lake's level since its spillways were damaged last week.\n\"There is more than enough room in the lake to continue accommodating incoming water and the lake level will continue to be lowered,\" the state Department of Water Resources said Friday.\nUp the West Coast, after a week of snow and heavy rains, landslides were covering roads in Washington state. Commuter trains into Seattle were canceled Thursday due to slides, and Spokane County declared a state of emergency due to flooding and washed out roadways.\nAfter five years of drought, California has seen a long series of storms that have filled reservoirs and loaded the Sierra Nevada with snow.

The latter category was confined to a sliver of territory northwest of Los Angeles.\n___\nAP writers Mike Balsamo, Robert Jablon and Doug Ferguson contributed to this report.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/swflash.cab", "http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer", "http://www.ap.org/"], "published": "2017-02-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:55:36.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
