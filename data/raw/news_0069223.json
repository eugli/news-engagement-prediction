23 September \nThree of the seven planets found appear to be rocky in nature and to host surface temperatures capable of sustaining liquid water and, therefore, oceans. By extension, this means that their atmospheric conditions would potentially be able to sustain alien life, representing “the holy grail for planet-hunting astronomers”.\nScientists will begin investigating the molecular make-up of the exoplanets. If sufficient amounts of oxygen are found in their atmospheres, this would “strongly” indicate the presence of biological activity taking place.\n2. Even if life isn’t found immediately, it could still evolve in future One of the stars, dubbed TRAPPIST-1 , is relatively young and will still be in its infancy once our own sun has exhausted its fuel and been destroyed – an alarming notion.\nTRAPPIST-1 though burns hydrogen so slowly that it will live on for another 10 trillion years, 700 times longer than our universe and ample time to evolve organic life, according to Ignas AG Snellen of the Leiden Observatory.\n\n3. The planets were identified using a process called transit photometry Nasa researchers using the Hubble Space Telescope discovered the solar system by observing the passage of planets as they drifted by host stars. \nIn passing, celestial bodies obscure a small amount of light, a phenomenon that serves to indicate their size and shape. Having traced 34 such transits, the scientists were able to confirm the presence of the seven spheres. \n4. Living conditions on the exoplanets would be darker and warmer than those on earth A human being situated on one of the new planets would experience 200 times less light than they are used to from our own sun, the difference likened to that between watching a sunset and midday glare. \nRead more How the new solar system that could support life would actually look Dimmer than earth, the planets would nevertheless be just as warm as they experience much the same heat energy as we do from our sun, albeit transmitted as infrared rays. \nA person looking up at the new solar system’s sun from terra firma on TRAPPIST-1 would see it as salmon pink in colour and larger than our own. “The spectacle would be beautiful,” said Amaury Triaud, one of the scientists involved in the research. \nWhether the inhabitants of such a world would have eyes similar to own remains to be seen - they could have evolved entirely new means of seeing to cope with the different light exposure.\n5. This is just the beginning Exciting as the new discovery is, astronomers say there could still be an additional 40 billion potentially habitable worlds sitting just inside our galaxy, along the Milky Way. \nThe first exoplanet was found in 1992. Since then, over 3,500 new worlds have been located across 2,675 star systems. As technologies continue to advance and become ever-more sophisticated, the possibilities of finding more seem infinite.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:28:19.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
