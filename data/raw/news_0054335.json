They’ve got great vision, dexterity, mobility. \n“They’re wonderful athletes and if we allow these players to get to 17 or 18 or 19 and not have an effective career ahead of them, we do risk losing them to other sports.” \nEXPLAINED: GRAND PLAN TO RE-WRITE WOMEN’S FOOTBALL \nThe PFA say plans to reinvigorate the W-League have been in the works for close to a year, yet there’s no doubt the rapid rise and success of the AFL competition has escalated the need to publicly press for lifting its professionalism and profile. \nWhile the AFLW does compete with the W-League for both viewers and athletes, its remarkable first-season success has been part of a massive lift in publicity and public support for women’s sport. \nPFA Player Relations Executive and former Matilda Kathryn Gill said the AFLW and WBBL had exposed the potential of women’s sport. \n“I guess the new competitions have highlighted the demand for women’s sport in general,” Gill said. \n“Now ... we’re running out of seats at stadiums to watch women playing AFL. \n“I think it’s fantastic, it’s changed the landscape and we’re now going to play our part in even further enhancing that.” Melbourne City celebrate their win.
