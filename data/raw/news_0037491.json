Certainly her support of British designers such as David and Elizabeth Emanuel, Bruce Oldfield, Catherine Walker, and Zandra Rhodes was patriotic, but it never felt forced or fake. (Neither, for that matter, did her philanthropy, expressed with compassion and deeds rather than words.) The Princess wasn’t one to follow trends, and her style choices were in keeping with royal protocol while still seeming personal. She was known, for example, to like bright colors, and would often dress to match the flags of the countries she visited. Diana became increasingly fashion savvy as she evolved from a feather-haired Sloane-y ingenue to the ultimately tragic “Queen of Hearts.” Her wardrobe reflected the stages of her life and growing confidence, and will be given the museum treatment next year when “Diana: Her Fashion Story” opens on February 24 at the Piggott Gallery at Kensington Palace. In anticipation of the upcoming exhibition, we’ve selected the 25 looks we hope will be on display.
