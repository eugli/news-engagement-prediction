A fan tries to explain \nCrystal Palace have picked up nine points from their last 19 matches as relegation from the Premier League has gone from being merely possible to very probable Dejected Crystal Palace fans watch Manchester United win the FA Cup at Wembley.

By the end of September they were comfortably nestled in the top half of the table and looked to have recaptured the form that had put them in touching distance of a Champions League place the previous Christmas. The confidence was returning and fans were looking forward to the team progressing in their fourth consecutive season in the Premier League. There was even talk about Alan Pardew becoming the new England manager after Sam Allardyce’s unexpected and abrupt departure (little did we know how the irony of that speculation would play out just a few months later). \nThose three league wins in a row in September have proven a false dawn. In the subsequent 19 league matches, Palace have won two matches, drawn three and lost 14, picking up nine points from a potential 57. They are now 19th, level on points with bottom club Sunderland. How did it come to this? \nThe downturn in results began last season, while Palace were distracted by an FA Cup run that ended in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester United in the final. The fact that Palace won twice as many games against Premier League opponents (Stoke, Southampton, Tottenham and Watford) in the FA Cup than they did in the 21 league matches between mid-December and May (Norwich and Stoke) shows where their attention lay. The previous two losing FA Cup finalists, Hull City and Aston Villa, were both relegated the following year and that pattern could well be extended this season.

Their form has not picked up this season, with just five wins from 25 matches so far. The confidence has drained out of the players and there seems to be little anyone can do to turn things round. Relegation has become a probability rather than the remote possibility it was just a few months ago. \nSome, perhaps mischievously, have made a connection between the arrival of American investors, Joshua Harris and David Blitzer, with their £50m funding in December 2015 and the start of the decline in form. While this may just be a very unhappy coincidence, there is a feeling that the club has lost much of the spirit and identity that was so integral as they established themselves as a Premier League club over the last few years. There has been a certain amount of razzmatazz added to matchdays, such as the flashing lighting, which feels more akin to the Super Bowl than SE25 and is alien to the club’s culture. \nThe move towards becoming more of a global entity has eroded the essentially gritty heart of the club. The motto of “South London and Proud” was chosen to emphasise the importance of the strong connections with the local community but this has been diminished as attention has been focused on attracting an overseas audience, with a particular focus on the American market. \nThat sense of unity has disappeared and we have now reached the point where fans are arguing among themselves and even confronting players. What was once a harmonious union between fans and players has become fractious and divisive and this is clearly undermining the team. \nSince Palace earned promotion to the Premier League in 2013 the atmosphere at Selhurst Park has rightly been regarded as among the most raucous of any top-flight club but what was once viewed as an intimidating ground for visiting teams has become a haven of easy pickings. There is now a sense of trepidation that hangs in the air during games and the faith in what the team were doing has been swept away. \nPalace’s home form has been woeful over the last three seasons. In both 2014-15 and 2015-16 they won just six of their 19 home matches, winning just 21 points at home in both campaigns. They have won seven points from 12 matches so far this season – two wins and one draw this season, giving seen this pattern continue and the meagre total of seven points from 12 matches is the lowest by some margin. \nPardew arrived as a returning hero back in December 2014. A former player who had scored the famous goal against Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final in 1990, he succeeded in lifting the club from the relegation places to the safety of mid-table by the end of the 2014-15 season. By the time he left in December 2016 his reputation had been tarnished as the team drastically under-performed over the previous year. There was no lack of finance in trying to address this alarming slump but despite substantial investment in the playing squad adding established internationals such as Christian Benteke and Steve Mandanda before the start of the season, the rot had well and truly set in. Added to which the majority of the players who had performed so admirably over the previous few years lost form and their self-belief drained away. \nPardew’s attempts to instil an attacking philosophy led to a defensive frailty that kept surfacing at the worst moments. The 5-4 loss to Swansea in November, when the team were leading going into added time, was as hapless as it was avoidable. The propensity to concede crucial late goals has been a running sore throughout the season and that game marked the absolute nadir. Pardew had reached the point of no return for most fans but Palace chairman Steve Parish remained loyal to him for a little while longer. Pardew eventually paid the price a few weeks later and was replaced by Sam Allardyce just before Christmas. Sam Allardyce makes his way to the touchline before Palace’s game with Sunderland. Photograph: Tony O'Brien/Reuters \nAllardyce arrived with that well-worn label of “never being relegated from the Premier League” but in truth he has only rescued a few teams from impending relegation: Sunderland last year, Blackburn in 2008-09 and Bolton in their first couple of years in the division. In almost 20 years of Premier League management, the majority of his clubs have been comfortably mid-table and not under imminent threat of going down. \nHis reputation as the Red Adair of the Premier League is based on a few rescues rather than a long history. Added to which, he was badly burned by his brief encounter with England and looks as though he has not really recovered from losing his dream job after only 67 days. It also feels as if he is not a natural fit for the club and lacks an affinity with the fans. So having had a manager who was perhaps too much of a club insider and was allowed too much leeway as a result, Palace have gone to the other extreme. \nThe so-called “new-manager bounce” that most teams seem to harness has not materialised for Allardyce. Paul Clement and Marco Silva have coaxed impressive performances and picked up precious points out of two teams that were almost written off before they took over. Allardyce’s record so far is exactly the same as Pardew’s last eight games: one win, one draw and six defeats. Palace have not conceded as many goals under Allardyce – 14 as opposed to 20 under Pardew – but they have scored only four compared to 16 in those last eight games under Pardew. In the period since Allardyce took, Palace have created the fewest chances from open play in the league. The only high note came in the away win at Bournemouth, when they miraculously kept a clean sheet, but any optimism was quickly and brutally extinguished a few days later, when they welcomed Sunderland to Selhurst Park. \nTwo of Allardyce’s most sickening defeats have come against his former clubs. West Ham’s teething problems at the London Stadium were nowhere to be seen as they recorded their biggest home win so far this season , while the Sunderland game will go down as one of the poorest performances at Selhurst Park for some time. Palace conceded three goals in the last five minutes of the first half and trooped off to a chorus of boos. Incredibly, a team who had scored 20 goals all season were 4-0 up and coasting towards only their second away victory of the season. When Jack Rodwell finally breaks his jinx of not winning a game he has started – a run of 39 games over almost four years – you get the feeling that relegation is coming. \nParish was so incensed by the pitiful capitulation against Sunderland that he addressed the players in the dressing room afterwards and Allardyce ordered them to report for training at 7am on the Sunday morning. To heap further ignominy on that indignity, the following week Sunderland themselves surrendered meekly 4-0 at home to Southampton. Want to watch a new football league?

Palace recorded the highest net spend in the January transfer window as Jeffrey Schlupp (£9m), Patrick van Arnholt (£12m) and Luka Milivojevic (£11m) were brought in to bolster obvious weaknesses down the left and in central midfield. When Allardyce took over he said that it might take until March or April before fans saw any marked improvement and, after the recent defeat to Everton, he said that Palace might well not be safe until May if at all. I hope somebody has told Allardyce that his team’s last three away games are against Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City. \nPerhaps the worst consequence of all this is yet to come. Relegation can sometimes be viewed as a chance to regroup, supported by parachute payments and then bouncing back in style, rejuvenated, as Newcastle seem to be doing this season. It is the team that looks more than likely to be accompanying Newcastle that is the real cause for concern. If Brighton are promoted to the Premier League for the first time and Palace go in the opposite direction, it will be as close to unbearable as possible – the Seagulls will be in a higher league than the Eagles for the first time in 34 years. What a time to be alive. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:17:52.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
