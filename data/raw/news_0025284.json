Rowling Going: She’s a ‘Serial Loser’ by Josh Feldman | 10:46   \nPiers Morgan continued his feud with author J.K. Rowling on Fox News tonight, calling her a “serial loser.” \nLast Friday, Morgan was a guest on Bill Maher ‘s show and things got particularly fierce between him and comedian Jim Jefferies ( the latter telling the former to “fuck off” ). Rowling tweeted about how much she enjoyed Morgan being ripped a new one, which led to a big Twitter argument between the two of them . \nTonight Morgan spoke to Tucker Carlson first about Jefferies, expressing how offensive he finds the rhetoric of Trump being compared to Hitler. \nCarlson then asked about Rowling and why she’s “so upset.” Morgan called her a “serial loser” for 1) not backing the winning candidate in a past UK election, 2) opposing Brexit, and 3) supporting Hillary Clinton . \nHe said, “If you’re J.K. Rowling, you’re three for three. You are the worst celebrity political pundit on the entire planet.” \nMorgan said he’s frustrated with anti-Trump hysteria and told Rowling what he thinks she should do: \n“Just go write about Hogwarts, wizards, whatever they are. I’ve never read a word of Harry Potter. Just go and immerse yourself in the world of Muggles or whatever they are, and shut up.” \nAfter Morgan tweeted to Rowling recently that he’s never read the books, Rowling tweeted this in response: . @piersmorgan If only you’d read Harry Potter, you’d know the downside of sucking up to the biggest bully in school is getting burned alive. \n— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 11, 2017 \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:14:23.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
