Newspapers are seeing a sharp rise in subscriptions. Television news, once dismissed as a dinosaur in the internet age, is thriving. Rachel Maddow’s audience on MSNBC is up 79 percent from a year ago, with her show pulling more than two million viewers a night for the past two weeks. On Tuesday, Tucker Carlson of Fox News had more viewers than network hits like “New Girl” and “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” If the routine is energizing, it is also relentless. On Wednesday afternoon, the Atlantic staff writer Rosie Gray tweeted , “only 9 hours or so till the next massive newsbreak that will prevent us from having lives again.” Hallie Jackson, White House correspondent for NBC News, replied jokingly a minute later — “wuts a life” — to which Ms. Gray replied : “I remember vaguely there was a time when i had one.” By evening, Ms. Gray’s original message had been “liked” more than 850 times. “The breathless pace of events reminds me of O. J. and Monica days,” said Jeffrey Toobin, who covered the O. J.

This feeling of, ‘Well, can’t it just stop for a while?’” Even people paid to satirize politics find themselves agog. On the Los Angeles set of “Veep,” the HBO parody series with Julia Louis-Dreyfus, writers and cast members rush to learn the latest news between takes. “Everyone’s on their phone,” said Frank Rich, the liberal columnist, who is an executive producer of the series. The accelerated metabolism is nonpartisan. Many right-leaning news sites are covering every twist of the White House developments and resisting the notion that the administration is embroiled in a major scandal.
