In an interview with Digital Trends , Momoa spoke about what we’re going to see in the Warner Bros. film, directed by James Wan ( The Conjuring ). Momoa joked about being teased about playing the role, because the character has often been derided as one of the lesser superheroes in the DC Universe . \nHe said, “…the cool thing with Aquaman is how it taps into the native culture and that’s something that we’re only taught a little about, so there’s a lot of interesting things. I really think it’s the right time. It’s really cool. Zack [Snyder] is one of those perspectives on it and DC is really getting behind it. It was a ballsy step. They did it, and I’m extremely happy with the world they’ve created. It’s an honor to be part of this.” \nMomoa also talked about the influences on the story, saying: “I read the [Aquaman] script and let me just put it this way, I’ve never seen a movie that’s anything like this. It’s going to be a world that you’ve never seen before, which is really cool. We went to space, we traveled all over different worlds, but we never went underwater. So it’s just a really cool spin on what’s below and it uses a lot of great movies that I already love — whether that be Raiders of the Lost Ark to Star Wars to Lord of the Rings to Romancing the Stone. It has a lot of really cool adventure, it’s funny and heroic, and there’s a lot of different characters and a lot of different worlds that we get to go to.” \nHe went on to say that he, “…read the script and just started training for it and I can’t wait. I’ve spent a lot of time in this industry, so I’m excited to put all my energy into it and completely f*** some s*** up.” \nAquaman also stars Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Nicole Kidman, Temuera Morrison and Willem Dafoe. The character was first introduced in a cameo in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and will next be seen in Justice League on November 17, 2017. Aquaman will hit theaters on October 5, 2018.
