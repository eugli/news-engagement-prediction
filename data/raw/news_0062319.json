There was nothing in the house. No, we didn’t think about it – we just ran and got her and said we’ll figure out what we were going to do after we got her out of there.” \nMahnken reached out to a firefighter friend, who agreed to temporarily watch Ashley. \nThe “Fort Pitt” firefighters took to their new pooch, nicknamed “Ash,” who now lives with them permanently, eating meals with them, and even going on ride-alongs in the fire trucks. A post shared by CBS News (@cbsnews) on Feb 22, 2017 at 7:22am PST \nAshley even has her own Instagram account . \n“Reporting for doodie…ready to ride…I got the woof! (Roof),” one post joked. \nWhen Manhken found Ashley in January, veterinarians said she was 25 pounds underweight. The FDNY firefighters say she’s now about 50 pounds, and well on her way to becoming perfectly healthy.
