The author, who has two sons with her husband Tom Fletcher , made the revelation as she promoted her new book, Happy Mum, Happy Baby . Speaking on BUILD, a live interview series, Giovanna said: \"I fell pregnant very quickly and I had this thing in my head that it was just too easy. After being worried for so long that it wouldn't be easy it just happened. And then I miscarried not long after that and I think part of me felt that would happen, because I felt that it was too easy. Because I felt that I hadn't earned it. If that didn't happen I wouldn't have Buzz and Buzz will forever be my silver lining.\" VIEW GALLERY \"I fell pregnant very quickly and I had this thing in my head that it was just too easy,\" said Giovanna \nGiovanna, who welcomed her first son Buzz in 2014 two years after her wedding , admitted: \"When it comes to miscarriage I think we're all too scared to say something. I felt like I could never say anything to friends because people feel like it's contagious.\" She added: \"It's a really rubbish thing that happens and it happens to so many people. All you really want in that moment is a hug. You feel like your body has failed you and that's your first experience as a mother.\" \nThe presenter revealed her miscarriage for the first time in her book. Writing in Happy Mum, Happy Baby , which is a candid account about motherhood, Giovanna explained: \"When I was pregnant I experienced a newfound appreciation for the body I'd spent years hating. From the moment I found out I was pregnant, I stopped anything that might have been the slightest bit challenging as I'd miscarried during my first pregnancy and was worried it would happen again.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:16:15.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
