Recently discovered asteroid 2017 BS32 zips by around midday Thursday.\nThis latest narrow shave comes just a few days after the closest such flyby in months , prompting observers and some astronomers to wonder if the apparent blitz of tiny planetoids could be more than mere coincidence.\nAccording to astronomer Paul Cox at the Slooh observatory , the apparent bursts of small, close-approaching asteroids first spotted just before buzzing us initially sparked discussion in 2016. \n\"One possibility sprang to mind -- that these clusters of smaller asteroids making close approaches to Earth over relatively short periods of time were in fact the fragments from larger asteroids that had broken up,\" Cox said via email. \"However, when we reviewed the orbits of each of the asteroids, we found no correlation between them - showing clearly they weren't associated in any way.\"\nCox said the scientists also looked for a connection to seasonal changes or to weather at observatories that might reduce discoveries of nearby asteroids, but there was no conclusive data to be found. \nAsteroids abound!

As far as we know, all these last-minute discoveries from the past year or so have flown by us safely without incident. \nSo all there really is to do is sit back and enjoy the show. 2017 BS32, which measures between 36 and 82 feet (11 and 24 meters) will come closest to us at 12:23 p.m. PT Thursday. At that point, it will be 100,214 miles (161,279 kilometers) overhead, according to Slooh, 60 percent closer than the moon.\nSlooh will be live-streaming the pass of 2017 BS32, which you can watch below or at Slooh.com , where you can also chat with astronomers and control some telescopes yourself. \nSolving for XX : The industry seeks to overcome outdated ideas about \"women in tech.\" \nCrowd Control : A crowdsourced science fiction novel written by CNET readers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:13:53.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
