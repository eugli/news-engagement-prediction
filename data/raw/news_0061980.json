The Huskies pushed the lead to 59-39 after three quarters and then scored the first 10 points of the final period. \nHaley Smith had 16 points for Colorado (15-13, 5-12), which lost to Washington 79-75 at home on Feb. 5. \nOsahor scored the first 10 points of the game, including a pair of 3-pointers, to put Washington up 10-0. Colorado closed the first quarter with an 8-3 run to pull within 20-18. Osahor had 15 points in the first period. \nPlum, who missed her only shot attempt in the first quarter, scored six points to pace a 9-0 run to open the second quarter as Washington opened a 29-18 lead with 6:54 left in the half. \nBIG PICTURE \nColorado: After a 10-0 start under first-year coach JR Payne, the Buffaloes struggled in the rugged Pac-12. But, they were 4-4 in the eight games prior to Thursday. Colorado was 2-16 in the conference last season, 7-23 overall. \nWashington: The Huskies have clinched a top-four seed and a first-round bye in the Pac-12 Tournament, to be played at KeyArena in Seattle, March 2-5. \nUP NEXT \nColorado finishes the regular season at Washington State on Saturday afternoon. The Buffaloes defeated the Cougars at home 70-58 earlier this month. \nWashington closes the regular season at home on Saturday afternoon against Utah. The Huskies won at Utah 82-53 on Feb. 3.
