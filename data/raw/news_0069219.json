After the dragging the boy around, the LAPD officer is approached by two other teens. Footage appearing to show the off-duty officer in an altercation with a group of teenagers was uploaded to YouTube on Wednesday. \nOne attempts to break the officer’s grip on Dorscht, while another rushes in, pushing the officer into a hedge in an apparent attempt to dislodge his grip. The police officer pulls the gun from his waistband and fires after a tall teenager takes swings a punch at him. \nTwenty-four people were arrested at the protest on charges including failure to disperse, resisting arrest, and battery on a peace officer. Of those, six were minors, all of whom were released to the custody of their parents. \nDuring the demonstration, Christian’s mother, Alma Jimenez, held up a picture of her son and addressed the demonstrators and police, including some who were wearing riot gear. \n“Stop shooting our kids. Stop killing our kids. This is my child right here. This is my son. He’s 13 years old. He was not armed. [The LAPD officer] almost killed my son. Thanks to God’s grace, [Christian] is alive.” \nFreddie Reyes, 59-year-old Fullerton resident, was visiting with his niece in Anaheim when he saw the video and drove to the Wednesday night protest.

He could have killed somebody … just for [walking] over the grass. It’s not right.” \n“The thing that everybody’s concerned about is that [the officer] got to stay home while that 13-year old boy was arrested. A 13 year old,” said Reyes. \nLA resident Mateo Rubio wondered whether the officer should be retrained and asked: “How could he be fighting with some kids because they walked on his grass? Is this person going to come back into our community and treat our families the same way?” \nAccording to LAPD public information officer, Tony Im, the department will take 72 hours to conduct an investigation before briefing the chief of police on the administrative aspect of the case. In the meantime, the off-duty officer in the videos is on paid administrative leave. \nThe Anaheim police department is handling the criminal investigation of all involved parties including the officer. \nWhen asked why the man in the video was not arrested, Anaheim police sergeant Jacob Gallacher said: “This is an ongoing investigation and once it’s complete, it will be turned over to the district attorney’s office for review.” \nNeighbors off the off-duty officers emphatically described local residents as respectful, “live and let live” people. They said that Palm Lane Park just a few houses down the street is a hangout for young people who cause trouble. They asked not to be identified and pointed a garage door that had been spray-painted “Fuck Pigs” and a car that had been scratched with a key.
