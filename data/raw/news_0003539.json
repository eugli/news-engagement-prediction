After six controversial, hotly debated, and critically praised seasons, HBO’s Girls will come to an end this year. To celebrate, the cast and behind-the-scenes team gave The Hollywood Reporter an oral history of the series. Creator and star Lena Dunham and showrunner Jenni Konner recall that when the show was first being developed, everyone from Scott Rudin to John Lesher wanted to produce it. It was an intense pursuit. “I was getting calls as if I had been friends with these producers since I was born and was betraying them,” says Dunham. “People ask what happens to young female directors when they come to Hollywood. The first people who support them feel this incredible sense of entitlement.” One male producer even suggested doing an episode about “when the girls sync their periods,” Dunham says. Speaking of sexism: stars Alison Williams and Zosia Mamet say that despite the show’s success, both are “still fighting tooth and nail” for roles that are nothing like their Girls characters. Meanwhile, Adam Driver has had the cast’s most explosive and varied acting success outside of the show. “I think it’s still much harder for a woman than a man,” Mamet says, though she adds that she means “no slight” to Driver’s talent. “Adam is something unusual that Hollywood was waiting for...but I do think that—and I experience it, too—it can be harder for people to separate female TV characters from the actors playing them,” Dunham says. Dunham also, once again, addresses early criticism that accused the show of being racist—and admits that in its first year, she really was tone deaf about those concerns. As evidence, Dunham puts forth a deeply cringe-worthy comment she made around the time the second episode of Girls aired: “I made a really, really dumb joke that I'm perfectly fine to repeat now 'cause I was f—in' 25. I said, 'No one would be calling me a racist if they knew how badly I wanted to f— Drake,’” she recalls. Her boyfriend, Jack Antonoff , warned her away from making comments like those: “He said, 'Don’t say that in public; that's not going to help you.’ I just didn't get it.” On a lighter note, she also shares the one line HBO simply would not let her notoriously graphic show cross: the network put the kibosh on a shot that pictured “cum arcing,” Dunham says. According to Konner, Mike Lombardo , the network’s then-president of programming, “came to us and said, 'You don’t need it,’ and we thought, 'You pussies.’ But when Mike fought us on stuff, which wasn't often, he was always right.” The network’s response? “In HBO’s defense, it was like a fire hose!” says former HBO entertainment president Sue Naegle .
