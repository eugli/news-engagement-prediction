First degree would require that the killing had been pre-meditated. \nHe also was found guilty of animal cruelty in the death of the family dog. \nLindsey Mauti, 30, was found dead on May 20, 2015 , in the garage of the family home in the Cheshire Park subdivision, near Sashabaw Rd., by deputies sent for a welfare check after she didn’t show up for work. The dog was found dead nearby, also the victim of severe blunt force trauma, according to investigators. \nThe couple’s two children — a 2-year-old girl and a 6-year-old boy — were found inside the house with their father, but they were unharmed. Joseph Mauti, who record show had a previous conviction for domestic violence, was arrested at the scene. \nHe will be sentenced next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:29:07.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
