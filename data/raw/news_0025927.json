Elections in UP will be held in 7 phases. \n\nHere are the key highlights of PM Modi's speech in Ghaziabad: \n\n* PM asks Akhilesh Yadav to respond to UP people account of the work done in the state \n\n* I have respect for Mulayam Singh Yadav, when Akhilesh came, we have many hopes from him, but he have destroyed all hopes \n\n* I will give all account of my work in 2019 elections \n\n* Today, women cannot go out after evening in Uttar Pradesh \n\n* Girls fear of going to schools, SP has given shelters to criminals \n\n* Even brightest student of Uttar Pradesh has no job \n\n* This government has deprived UP youth of their rights \n\n* I want to assure youth that BJP will keep its poll promises made in UP manifesto \n\n* BJP will work for the welfare of youth if comes to power \n\n* Corruption has destroyed our country \n\n* Someone has to fight against corruption \n\n* You tell me, if there is corruption in UP and I will try to remove corruption from Delhi, will I succeed? asks PM. \n\n* To remove corruption, we must remove the ongoing corrupt government \n\n* There were corruption in government jobs for grade C and D posts. Our government has removed the interview system to eliminate corruption \n\n* I am MP from UP, this state has made me Prime Minister but Samajwadi Party government has refused to implement the new system of government jobs proposed by us \n\n* Taunt me, abuse me if you want, but you must give account of work done by your government \n\n* Small traders were deliberately trapped in some kind of cases in UP, what is their fault \n\n* SP government has refused CAG audit for Ghaziabad Development Authority \n\n* I promise that if BJP comes to government, we will conduct CAG audit of every development authority in Uttar Pradesh including Ghaziabad \n\n* If you want to break free from exile of development, vote for BJP \n\n* Akhilesh is so much frightened that he has tied up with a sinking boat (Congress) \n\nIn his last two speeches in Uttar Pradesh, Narendra Modi has hit rival parties hard. Taunting Akhilesh Yadav, Modi has said that UP CM is clinging to whatever support he gets and this is why he has tied up with Congress. In his February 4 rally in Meerut, Modi has defined SCAM as Samajwadi Party, Congress, Akhilesh, Mayawati while in his Aligarh rally in February 5, he has expanded Vikas as 'Vidyut' (electricity), 'Kanoon' (law) and 'Sadak' (roads). BJP has repeatedly said that the party is going to win at least 90 seats out of 140 seats going to polls in first two phases.
