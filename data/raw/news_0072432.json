Lewis put away Browne via a come-from-behind second round KO (punches) in the UFC Fight Night 104 main event, yet on Tuesday he posted a video on his Instagram in which he’s having his foot examined at the doctor’s office. In it, he says he broke his foot. A post shared by Derrick Lewis (@thebeastufc) on Feb 21, 2017 at 1:32pm PST The 32-year Lewis is one of the hottest fighters going right now in the UFC, having won six straight bouts going back to 2015. Browne was considered to be his toughest test to date, and through the first round things weren’t looking good for “The Black Beast.” Browne was landing heavy body kicks and leg kicks and making it difficult for Lewis to close the distance. However, in the second round Lewis began to take over the fight. he hurt Browne on a couple of exchanges, and finally knocked him down with a glancing right hand that signaled the beginning of the end. Lewis has gone 8-2 overall in the UFC, having made his debut against Jack May in Florida in 2014. His only losses came against Matt Mitrione and Shawn Jordan.
