Given the fake feud between the pair that’s gone on for more than 10 years, Kimmel was never going to pass up an opportunity to chide the actor, and he didn’t.\nAnd from his opening monologue all the way up through Damon’s attempt to present an Oscar, it’s possible Kimmel fit in a record number of jabs at his supposed archnemesis.\nAdvertisement\nIt all started with the host’s opening monologue, in which he proclaimed that he was finally ready to “bury the hatchet” with Damon, summarizing their history by saying, “I’ve known Matt so long, when I first met Matt, I was the fat one.”\nKimmel then seemed to praise Damon for giving up the lead role in “Manchester by the Sea,” for which Casey Affleck would win an Oscar later in the evening.\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond. Sign “He could have taken that lead actor part for himself, but he gave that role to Casey Affleck, his childhood friend,” Kimmel said, launching into a takedown. “He handed what turned out to be an Oscar-caliber role over to his friend, and made a Chinese ponytail movie instead.\nView Story A look back at the ‘rivalry’ between Matt Damon and Jimmy Kimmel Kimmel will host the Oscars Sunday, but his longtime faux-nemesis Damon is sure to be there.\nFull Oscars coverage\n“And that movie, ‘The Great Wall,’ went on to lose $80 million,” Kimmel added. “Smooth move, dumbass.”\nLater in the night, the host feigned an unexpected, pre-filmed tribute to Damon’s family dramedy “We Bought a Zoo.” Sitting in a darkened theater, Kimmel reflected on his experiences watching the 2011 movie in a “completely empty” Burbank theater.\nAdvertisement\n“It was just me and Matt and the animals,” mused Kimmel, adding of Damon’s acting ability, “He makes two words feels like . . . three words.\n“He shows he’s able to hear words and . . . repeat them back. The thing about Matt is that you can see how hard he’s working — it’s so effortful for him.”\nChris Pizzello/Invision/AP\nJimmy Kimmel stared at Matt Damon after Damon tripped him during the Academy Awards.\nClosing out the bit, Kimmel added, his voice filled with fake awe, “He has almost no discernible talent, but it works.”\nImmediately following that takedown, as Ben Affleck and Damon took the stage to present the award for original screenplay, Kimmel maintained his sense of mischief, instructing the announcer to identify Damon as “Guest,” then urging the orchestra to play him off as Damon tried to introduce the award.\n“What is with the music?” Damon asked, incredulous. “Are you playing me off? Seriously? I’m just presenting!”\nThe 2017 Academy Awards After a stunning mixup, ‘Moonlight’ awarded best picture How the 'Moonlight'-'La La Land' scene unfolded Plenty of sympathy to go around Pricewaterhouse Coopers apologizes for role in miscue Look at who wowed on the red carpet Host Jimmy Kimmel blends political humor with Hollywood teasing Trump was on people’s minds, if not lips, at Oscars Damien Chazelle’s Harvard professors remember him when Hollywood tour group gets surprise side trip to Oscar show Kimmel-Matt Damon ‘feud’ spills across the Oscars stage Winning Iranian director skips show over ‘inhumane’ travel ban Stars wear blue ribbons in support of ACLU Sting pays an emotional tribute to slain N.H. journalist James Foley In Rhode Island, fans cheer native Viola Davis's win Sound engineer wins first Oscar after 21 nominations Notable moments from the 2017 Oscars — other than that one List of winners at the 89th Academy Awards\nIsaac Feldberg can be reached at isaac.feldberg@globe.com .
