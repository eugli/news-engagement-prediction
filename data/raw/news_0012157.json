Tina Chapman applied for a new Quebec grant for children with disabilities but was turned down because the government didn't judge his autism to have a significant impact on his life. (Tina Chapman) \nBlake is now only able to spend a total of 15 to 20 minutes in the classroom each day. \n\"His first report card was blank,\" said Chapman. \"He's not there long enough for the teacher to see everything from him.\" \nHis aggressive acting out and tantrums not only hinder his learning but prevent him from playing or socializing with other students. \n\"How many life habit issues does he need to have before they say, 'Well yes, this child needs extra help?'\" asks Chapman. \nShe feels the government has turned its back on Blake and derailed all the progress he made. \n\"You can't cut it off at five years old and expect the school system to pick up the slack,\" said Chapman. \"It's irresponsible on their part.\" \nChapman has asked the government to reconsider its decision. \nShe's receiving support. Both the school principal and the school board's special education consultant wrote letters on her son's behalf, describing Blake's situation as \"urgent.\" \nA consultant brought in to assess Blake appealed for funding to help him access ABA therapy again as well as services to bring his anxiety under control. \n\"Blake is suffering,\" the consultant stated bluntly. Ontario and Alberta offer more services for children with autism, but Chapman doesn't want to uproot Blake and worries he might regress even further if they were separated from family and friends. (CBC News) Therapy would keep kids out of class, gov't says \nNoémie Vanheuverzwijn, a spokeswoman for Public Health Minister Lucie Charlebois, whose department oversees autism services, says one of the reasons free therapy isn't offered after the age of five is because it would keep the child out of the classroom too much. \nSome autistic children may require up to 20 hours of intensive therapy a week. But most children with autism who are able to go to public school require much less than that. \nAs Chapman points out, Blake only needs about six hours of therapy a week, which she thinks is manageable in a school setting. With that support, she's convinced he'd be in the classroom more. \nVanheuverzwijn says while they don't offer therapy, there are other programs for children like Blake. Besides aides to support the student in class, psychologists and speech therapists also visit. \nIn Blake's case, Chapman says the school gets some guidance from Blake's former public therapy centre. His aide has received an overview of ABA principles, but she's not specifically trained in autism therapy. Tina Chapman says she often has to pick up her son Blake early from kindergarten because he's unable to cope. (CBC News) Ontario, Alberta offer continued therapy \nThere is no age cut off in Alberta or Ontario. Children are evaluated and given services based on need. \nIn Ontario, Blake's ABA therapy would have continued hand-in-hand with the learning he'd get in kindergarten, said Sinthea Chowdhury, a family support coordinator for Autism Ontario. \nShe's not surprised Blake has struggled without the structure that ABA can provide many children with autism. \n\"It's heartbreaking,\" said Chowdhury. \"It's exhausting for the family and truly a disadvantage for that child.\" \nChapman is envious of the support other provinces provide. She's thought about moving but is reluctant to leave her family support system behind. \n\"Really in the end, I shouldn't have to uproot our life just to get services for my child,\" said Chapman. Why is it so hard for Quebec families to get the help they need for their autistic children? Still no autism plan in place \nIt's been a year since Quebec's first autism forum, last February, at which the public health minister brought together experts and parents of children with autism to get their feedback and vote on priorities for a new autism treatment plan. Quebec Minister for Rehabilitation, Youth Protection and Public Health, Lucie Charlebois, promised a new autism treatment plan at a forum in February 2016. (Jacques Boissinot/Canadian Press) \nThe plan was supposed to be introduced last summer, then it was pushed back to the fall. \nNow, Charlebois's office won't set a date, only saying it will be \"as soon as possible.\" \nParents like Chapman say they can't wait. \nShe's hopeful Quebec will adopt a treatment plan similar to Ontario's. \nAs it is now, desperate parents have to wait too long and jump through too many hoops to get funding, Chapman says. \n\"Consult the parents. We are on the front lines, we know what needs to be done.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T19:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T14:26:53.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
