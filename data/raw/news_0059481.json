Source: Facebook \nSarah has remained fiercely loyal to her father since the first day she went missing, clinging to him at public appeals for information and sobbing into his chest.\nWhen Mr Ristevski stopped co-operating with detectives in the middle of last year, claiming they had developed tunnel vision and were looking at no other suspects than him, Sarah followed suit, according to The Australian .\nSarah has also been dragged into a sordid feud between her father and his estranged son Anthony Rickard, a self-confessed ice addict .\nMr Rickard has alleged on numerous occasions that Mrs Ristevski planned to leave her husband after Sarah turned 21 (she had her birthday after her mother went missing), a claim which Mr Ristevski has disputed.\nMr Rickard moved in with the family when his mother kicked him out of her house as a teenager. Borce and Karen took him in and “a situation” developed between he and Mrs Ristevski.\nIn the statement, submitted to Sunbury police station on July 22 last year, Mr Rickard wrote that he’d “rather not fully detail (the situation) at this time’’, according to The Australian .\nOne time he claimed he had simply “overheard” Mrs Ristevski say she planned to leave Mr Ristevski after her daughter’s 21st birthday.\nAnother time he claimed (to both The Australian and the Herald Sun ) that Mrs Ristevski had planned to run away with him after Sarah’s birthday and that the tensions arising from this situation had led to her disappearance.\nHer uncle Vasko repeated Mr Rickard’s claim but put his own spin on it, telling reporters that he believed Mrs Ristevski had run away because of the tensions between her nephew, her husband and herself.\nMembers of Karen Ristevski's family arrive at Canning Reserve in Avondale Heights.

News.com.au is not suggesting Sarah has anything to do with Mrs Ristevski’s disappearance.\nBella Bleu closed in February last year and caveats had been placed on the Ristevski’s Avondale Heights home by lenders after Mr Ristevski resorted to borrowing cash from a notorious Melbourne loan shark on at least two occasions.\nMeanwhile, Sarah Ristevski remains holed up in her family’s Oakley Rd mansion with relatives and friends, including a young man thought to be her boyfriend.\nMissing persons squad detectives late Tuesday visited the Ristevski family home to deliver the devastating news that Mrs Ristevski’s body had been identified.\nThey spoke to Borce and Sarah for about an hour. Sarah has not spoken publicly since the discovery of her mother’s body.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:45:25.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
