No other president would have described the media as 'the enemy of the people'\", tweeted David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama. \nSteve Silberman, an award-winning writer and journalist, wondered whether the remark would prompt Trump supporters to shoot at journalists. \nAnd that might not be a far-fetched concern. Late last year, a Trump supporter opened fire in a pizza restaurant at the centre of a bizarre conspiracy theory about child abuse. \nMr Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric and policy have led to comparisons, from some quarters, with the rise of the Nazi party in Germany. \nHis use of \"enemies of the people\" raises unavoidable comparisons with other murderous dictators. \nUnder Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, out-of-favour artists and politicians were designated enemies and many were sent to hard labour camps or killed. Others were stigmatised and denied access to education and employment.

But the president's latest broadside, with all its attendant historical echoes, is unprecedented.
