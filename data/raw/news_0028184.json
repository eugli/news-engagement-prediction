Fortunately, after a night in the doggy 'intensive care' unit, he made a full recovery. Harris managed to push a wicker basket onto the cooker, causing a fire, while the couple were out playing badminton Not so lucky were Harris' owners, whose house was rendered uninhabitable by the smoke. Last night Fiona Milne and her fiancé Calum Campbell, from Liberton, Edinburgh, explained that the whole situation could have been even worse. MIss Milne, 25, said: 'We went out for an hour to play badminton. When we came home we heard the alarm, opened the door and the house was full of smoke. 'We ran in to the house but you couldn't see anything at all in the kitchen because the smoke was so thick. 'We were feeling around for Harris, then Calum found him at the back door. 'He had his head in his water bowl and he was unconscious. 'We just grabbed Harris and ran outside to call the fire brigade.' Harris, six-months-old, was unconscious when the pair returned home, but made a full recovery in doggy intensive care The fire caused more than £1000 worth of damage. The cooker was beyond repair, as were some cupboards, blackened wall tiles and the kitchen curtains. The vegetable basket and a boxed picture frame that was on the work surface were destroyed by the fire. The rest of the house was left uninhabitable because of the smell of smoke that permeated every corner of the property. Firefighters were able to put out the blaze before it took hold in the rest of the kitchen, and saved Harris' life by administering oxygen via a mask on the front lawn. Harris was then rushed to a vet for overnight 'intensive care'. The pet was kept overnight in an 'oxygen kennel' with medication administered through a cannula in his leg. Miss Milne and Mr Campbell had to move in with her mum. Miss Milne, a trainee paralegal with an Edinburgh law firm, said Harris was tired out from a long walk before the couple left the house. The fire caused £1000 worth of damage, and the cooker was left beyond repair They also 'dog-proofed' the property by clearing away anything their puppy could chew. The cooker was switched off, but Harris somehow turned the dial and manoeuvred the basket on to the hob. Fiona said: 'Harris is usually very obedient but he can be nosey. 'We always dog-proof the house but he must have been looking for a treat. He somehow switched on the hob and knocked over the basket which started smouldering. 'We're very lucky we came back when we did. If we'd come home later we could have lost the house and Harris.' The couple had planned to pick up some dinner from a nearby supermarket after their game of badminton but had to return home first as they had forgotten to bring money. Had they been any later, the fire might have spread beyond the cooking area and Harris would likely have died from smoke inhalation. Mr Campbell, 25, who works as an emergency call handler for Police Scotland, said: 'When I went in the kitchen, I couldn't see anything for smoke. I found Harris with his head in the water bowl. His body was completely limp. 'The firefighters couldn't say how long Harris had been unconscious, but they said if we had been any later we would not have been so lucky.' Miss Milne added: 'There's a Tesco next to the sports centre and we were going to get something for our tea but neither of us had money so we went home first. 'The firemen said if we'd been just a couple of minutes later it would have been a different story. We might have lost Harris and the house.' The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service confirmed they were alerted at 7.06pm on Friday January 27 to reports of smoke at the couple's house. A spokesperson said: 'A fire appliance from Liberton fire station attended the incident and quickly put out a small fire in the kitchen and ventilated the property. Firefighters provided oxygen for a pet dog in the property.'
