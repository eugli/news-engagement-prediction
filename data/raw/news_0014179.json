She also has a treatable case of mange and can be seen shaking in a video posted by the shelter. \nRescue agency Scout's Honor Rescue, Inc. has generously agreed to take in the dog and oversee her medical treatment. \nAs of Feb. 5, $7,360 worth in donations had been offered to help cover Grace's medical bills. \nIf you would like to donate, please go to paypal.me/texasshelterv. Mention in the notes that the donation is for Grace. \nGrace is currently being cared for until she is available to be adopted.
