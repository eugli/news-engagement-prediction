He immediately becomes possessive, sulking when she so much as talks to other men, and attempts to isolate her from her friends. \nHe shows up unannounced at her place of work. He traces her mobile phone to find her on a night out drinking with friends. He knows where she lives. He is controlling and emotionally manipulative. \nHe proceeds to have sex with her, despite her refusal and continued protestation. (There's a word for that.) The young woman reports feeling \"abused\". On the face of it, this scenario does not appear to be incredibly romantic, although it is one that unfortunately resonates with too many women \nRather than the grim tale of a sadistic man grooming a naive young woman for sexual violence and abuse, the Fifty Shades trilogy has been framed as a sexy romance or porn for women. \nREAD MORE: * Fifty Shades of Grey sequel coming \nFifty Shades Darker , the next film in the Fifty Shades of Grey franchise based on the popular book series by author E.L. James, will hit screens in New Zealand on February 9. \nBut it's the premise of the widely popular Fifty Shades of Grey book and film trilogy, the story of Anastacia Steele and Christian Grey. \nThe second instalment in the series, Fifty Shades Darker , is out this week, just in time for Valentines Day - because nothing says romance like intimate partner violence and stalking. \nRather than the grim tale of a sadistic man grooming a naive young woman for sexual violence and abuse, the series has been framed as a sexy romance or porn for women, with women jumping onboard. \nPutting aside the fact that if Christian Grey wasn't wealthy and handsome, this scenario could just as likely be an episode of CSI , women are supposed to view Fifty Shades as sexy and empowering, a bit of naughty fun â€“ despite female lead Dakota Johnson describing the sex scenes as \"uncomfortable\" and \"emotionally taxing\". Ad Feedback \nThe popularity of Fifty Shades of Grey is a testament to how far we have yet to come in working to end men's violence against women. \nAn analysis of the first book found that sexual violence and emotional abuse were pervasive, with Anastacia suffering harm as a result. \nAt Collective Shout , a grassroots movement against the objectification of women and sexualisation of girls in media, advertising and popular culture, we have seen firsthand how the popularity of Fifty Shades of Grey has left teenage girls confused about sex and relationships, wondering if male violence can be a sign of affection, or if stalking means he really loves you? \nOf course, it's not just Fifty Shades that is to blame. Popular culture is littered with messages and imagery that normalise violence against women, like Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines (\"I know you want it\"), advertising from brands such as Calvin Klein simulating gang rape or upskirting, and rape and murder of women in prostitution in the Grand Theft Auto video game series. \nWhen women are continually depicted as passive victims or objects of sexual recreation in media, advertising and popular culture, it impacts the way we perceive them, our attitudes and beliefs, and serves to both normalise violence and inequality and downplay the harms. \nIn response, dozens of groups have joined together to call for the public to boycott the film and to donate the money they would have spent on tickets to a women's refuge or domestic violence service. \nThese services are where women like Anastacia end up. They do such important work and are often underfunded and in need of financial assistance. \nIt's not enough to merely condemn violence against women: we must address it at its roots, recognise and challenge the cultural drivers of this violence. \nIt's time to connect the dots between a culture that normalises and even glorifies violence against women, and real-life violence against women. \nCaitlin Roper is campaigns manager for Collective Shout: for a world free of sexploitation. - Sydney Morning Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:46:00.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
