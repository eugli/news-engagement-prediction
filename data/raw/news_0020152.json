Apple CEO Tim Cook is having a wonderful European adventure Feb. 7, 2017, 6:31 PM 218 \nApple CEO Tim Cook Apple Apple CEO Tim Cook is in Europe and he's having a wonderful time. \nWe know this because Cook has been publicly sharing updates about his travels with his 4.1 million Twitter followers, posting a stream of new photos with the zeal of a work colleague flooding their friends' timelines with vacation photos. \nWhile it looks like Cook is having a blast in his posted photos, it's a business trip. A French startup CEO told Business Insider that Apple people contacted him 10 days ago to help set up one of Cook's meetings, so that he could learn more about French app developers. Cook is also set to give a speech at the University of Glasgow in Scotland on Wednesday. \nEven so, Cook appears to be eating well , meeting interesting people, and even testing out his foreign language skills. And he's dutifully chronicling it all on Twitter — of Cook's 328 total tweets, 8 of them are from this trip. \nSo far this week, he's visited France and Germany, and the trip's not over yet. \nHere's a quick look at his European travels: The public portion of Cook's trip started when he dropped into an Apple Store in Marseille, France. \nThen Cook met up with Jean claude Luong, who said he spent two hours with Apple's CEO. Luong had taken a photograph that was used in Apple's \"shot with iPhone campaign. \" \nApparently Cook wanted to know how he got the shot. \nThat wasn't the only Apple Store Cook visited that day. He popped into a Paris store late in the day. \nNow in Paris, Cook spent time meeting interesting people, like fashion designer Julien Fournié, in his couture studio. \nCook also found time to meet the CEO of BPCE, France's second largest bank. \n\nHere's the complete interview , although it's in French. Then he had a meal hosted in the home of a Parisian. The meal included salmon filets in creamy lemon shallot sauce, and was organized through an app called VizEat. Of course, he needs to check out what the cool new apps are in France, too. \nHe wrapped up the Paris part of his trip with a visit to artist JR's studio. \nApparently, the artist wanted him to take a look at a 13-year old computer. \nCook made his way to Germany, just across the Rhine river, next. Here's Tim checking out the factory of the company that builds the tables for Apple Stores and the Apple headquarters. \nFinally, Cook visited a kitchen in Berlin run by cooking app Kitchen Stories. Here, he's showing nice form flipping what appears to be a pancake of some sort, perhaps the famous German Apfelpfannkuchen. \nNailed it. Apple On Wednesday, Cook will give a speech at the historic University of Glasgow. He'll also receive an honorary degree.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:46:25.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
