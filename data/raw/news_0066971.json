For months now, this class has been panned as a bad one, but as the draft gets closer it seems like teams are falling for some of the passers in the group. Mitch Trubisky is a top-five lock. Davis Webb is rising up boards. Chad Kelly is a favorite sleeper. But the name getting talked about most is a former Tennessee Volunteer who landed at Pitt. A player few scouts talked about during the season, actually. Nathan Peterman, or as one scout told me this week, “this draft’s best chance at a Dak Prescott.” Peterman had a strong Senior Bowl week, and in my study of his film I’ve seen accuracy, poise, instincts and a good enough arm to make pro-level throws across the field. What the scout meant by “Dak-like,” though, isn’t that he’ll lead a team to a playoff run as a rookie. More likely he means a franchise can grab a starter outside the first two rounds. And Peterman can be that if he slips to the third round. As myself and every scout I know gets ready for Indianapolis, here’s what’s going on in the world of the draft: Updated Round 1 mock draft An interview with an anonymous NFL scout Reuben Foster a top-three player? Scouting in 140 characters And five names to know before the combine The Scout’s Report — Reuben Foster won’t perform at the combine due to shoulder surgery , but that hasn’t hurt his stock with NFL franchises. One team scout I spoke with this week said they ranked Foster as the No. 3 player in the entire 2017 draft class. That could change if franchises find issues in his medical check in Indianapolis—Foster has had knee injuries in the past—but the film grade is very high on the Alabama linebacker. —Speaking of Foster , here’s something I learned while doing background research on the ‘Bama stud. When he was 18 months old, his father shot him and his mother as she held him. His mom, Inita Paige, was wounded in the back. His father was arrested, bonded out and fled to California. There he was arrested and eventually sentenced to 30 years. But shortly after, his father escaped prison and was on the run for 16 years. —Who is the top cornerback in the 2017 draft class? For me it’s Quincy Wilson , but one NFC scout I spoke with this week said they ranked Alabama’s Marlon Humphrey as the top cover man. When reached for a comment, an AFC personnel man told me Ohio State’s Gareon Conley was their top corner. Needless to say, there isn’t yet a consensus top cornerback in this class. \nAdams’ full talent will be on display in Indy. Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images —LSU safety Jamal Adams , my No. 5 overall player in this class, told me Thursday he plans to compete in every drill at the combine. Adams isn’t hiding from scouts and has a chance to walk away as a big winner of the entire event. —Also expected to do every drill (other than the bench press, per Pro Football Talk ) at the combine is Trubisky . I love this decision to go out and compete, and it continues a trend of players represented by Rep 1 of going to Indianapolis with the mindset to win the week. —Much was made during Senior Bowl week when NFL Network analyst Mike Mayock said on a telecast that Trubisky was “a little over 6’1″.” That’s below the 6’2″ threshold NFL teams have established for the position and could be harmful to his draft stock. Trubisky’s college coach, Larry Fedora, isn’t buying it. In an interview with Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com, Fedora said “he’s going to measure probably 6’2″ or a little taller.” That matches with what scouts told me this week, as they expect he’ll be close to 6’2 ½ “. —Bleacher Report’s Jason Cole reported this week that Washington may be interested in Tony Romo if the team trades quarterback Kirk Cousins instead of signing him long term or using the franchise tag again for the 2017 season. A move to Washington makes sense for Romo, but only if he is released, as there isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell the Cowboys would trade him inside the division. —Oklahoma running back Joe Mixon isn’t welcome at the combine but will be welcomed with open arms at the Sooners’ pro day March 8, according to the school. Mixon, who was arrested in 2014 for punching a woman in the face, was able to take an Alford plea in the court system and was suspended (while redshirting) for the 2014 OU season. Without the off-field issues, h e’s a first-round talent . Given that video of the punch was released recently, Mixon’s draft stock is all over the map. —I’ve been trying to keep a running list of top players not performing at the combine, based on talks with agents, players and NFL teams. Here’s the total I’ve been able to verify: WR Corey Davis, Western Michigan (ankle) LB Reuben Foster, Alabama (shoulder) LB Jarrad Davis, Florida (ankle) LB Kendell Beckwith, LSU (knee) S Malik Hooker, Ohio State (hip labrum, hernia) OT Ryan Ramczyk, Wisconsin (hip labrum) 5 Names to Know 5. RB T.J. Logan, North Carolina While watching Trubisky a few weeks ago, I let my eyes drift and started to take more notice of the talent around the quarterback. Elijah Hood and Ryan Switzer were well-known players with almost full scouting reports done, but the “other” running back and wide receiver also caught my eye. T.J. Logan was that “other” back, and for my money, he’s better than Hood as a pro prospect. \nT.J. Logan could be on the rise. Don Juan Moore/Getty Images Logan is an exciting, versatile runner with more speed and better third-down ability than the more hyped Hood. He’s able to change up speeds, has good vision on the go and is a natural fit in a pro-style offense given his ability to create laterally and help in the passing game. He’s likely a fourth-rounder in this loaded running back class, but that’s good enough to get onto a depth chart and contribute as a rookie. 4. WR Mack Hollins, North Carolina The “other” receiver besides Switzer I was watching is Mack Hollins, and he looks like Martavis Bryant did coming out of Clemson. Hollins is a burner with great size (6’4″, 210 lbs) and body control on deep routes. He’s an elite over-the-top receiver with 20 career touchdowns despite missing time due to a collarbone injury that took half of his senior season. For vertical passing teams, Hollins will be tempting given his athletic potential, deep-ball production and the fact that he’s been held back by one freak injury and an offensive attack that didn’t feature him as the No. 1 target in any of his seasons. If you’re looking for a deep sleeper at wide receiver, Hollins in the middle rounds is my guy. 3. CB Gareon Conley, Ohio State A two-year starter for the Buckeyes, Conley has been lost in the shadow of Eli Apple (2015) and Marshon Lattimore (2016), but a source I spoke with at Ohio State said Conley graded out higher than both players for them. That’s impressive company. Conley doesn’t have Apple’s length or Lattimore’s speed, but his ball skills and natural coverage instincts are special. And while Apple was a top-10 pick and Lattimore most likely will be, Conley looks like a mid-first in a talented class of cornerbacks. The combine won’t be huge for Conley’s stock, but one scout I spoke with did wonder just how big he was. That might make the weigh-in Conley’s biggest test, but I’m excited to see his hips and feet in open-field drills. 2. WR Jerome Lane, Akron An NFC scout I was texting with recently told me to check out this hidden gem at Akron, saying he was a “young Anquan Boldin type.” He wasn’t wrong. Lane, a linebacker-turned-receiver, is 6’3″ and 220 pounds with a dominant playing style and mentality. He’s physical, aggressive and agile enough to separate against MAC defenders. It will be interesting to see how well he moves in Indianapolis, but the film grade on Lane is high enough to warrant a harder, longer look once measurables are in. You never want to overstate the importance of the combine, but for a small-school guy like Lane, he needs to show he has the speed and athleticism to compete in the NFL. 1. FS Eddie Jackson, Alabama Eddie Jackson is forgotten man in the safety group after breaking his leg midway through the 2016 season. He is back running now and will quickly get back on the radar of media scouts if he can perform at 100 percent in Indy. \nJackson (4) can do it all. Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images A natural playmaker, Jackson was the top-ranked defensive back on the Alabama defense when I scouted the 2015 tape. He was poised for another All-American season given his excellence as a punt returner and rangy free safety. That same skill set makes him a top-64 kind of player in this loaded class. Jackson is a great player with the ball in his hands and has produced well on the back end of the Alabama defense. He needs to gain strength, but from a pure film standpoint, he belongs in Round 2. The Big Board Who wants one more mock draft before the madness of the combine? Here’s my look at the first 32 picks.
