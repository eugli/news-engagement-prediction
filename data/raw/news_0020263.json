Fortunately or unfortunately, it relapsed just a few days back,” she wrote. \nIn the moving post, Mahnoor spoke about how she should be worrying about things that normal 21-year-olds worry about: exams and relationships for instance; instead, her life revolves around hospital visits, chemotherapy and not getting too attached to anyone. \nThis World Cancer Day, let’s talk about child patients \n“I am a 21-year-old who should be worrying about my quizzes and if I made it above the average, but instead I have to worry about my blood counts being in the normal range… I am a 21-year-old who should be worrying about relationships; instead, I worry about emotional attachment with almost anyone. I am a 21-year-old who should be the one making trips to the hospital for her parents and wheeling them around, instead they are the ones doing it.” \nPerhaps the most heart-wrenching part is what followed, when she wrote about her strength and willpower. \n“But none of that upsets me; it makes me only more grateful that I am an extraordinary 21-year-old. I am a 21-year-old with incredible strength, willpower, resilience, and courage to face one of the deadliest maladies again. A second attempt may be frustrating but I believe it can be easy too. And it makes me grateful to have the most amazing and supportive parents out there. But I am a 21-year-old who is nothing without Allah or the prayers that He answers. So I would request you all to keep me in your prayers as much as you can. No one knows when one of it might get accepted!” [/fbpost]\nPeople who knew Shabir, spoke of her bravery and resilience as she fought her battle. \nRest in peace, Mahnoor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:53:07.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
