And these are obsessive individuals who want to do the right thing, so they're very hard on themselves. \n\"This is a situation that is ripe for disaster.\" \nDr Miller also said some doctors had been unable to take leave for up to three years. \nHowever, that claim was rejected by the head of WA's Child and Adolescent Health Service (CAHS). \n\"I can't find any verification at all that we've got a member of staff waiting three years for leave,\" CAHS chief executive Frank Daly said. \n\"And that would be simply unacceptable. So if there is somebody out there, I would say please come forward.\" \nHe said the board of PMH had been aware of morale issues at the hospital for some time, and was confident those concerns were being addressed by the executive. \n\"I think they've been pretty successful,\" he said. \n\"On paper we're doing pretty well at granting leave and so forth. But it is very difficult to balance the staffing levels and our need to deliver a service to young kids.\" Delays at new children's hospital not helping \nDr Miller said the AMA had tried to discuss its concerns with hospital management, to no avail. \n\"All we get back are weasel management-style words where they say, 'look everything's fine, all the kids are fine, don't worry about it',\" he said. \nHe said it appeared the CAHS was pinning its hopes on the as yet unopened Perth Children's Hospital (PCH) to boost morale within the workforce.

We're providing an excellent service, and this is going to be the best paediatric hospital in the world',\" Dr Miller said. \n\"And when you get that response after going there with very real concerns, you understand management have no idea what they're dealing with in terms of engagement with their staff.\" \nPCH is more than a year behind schedule, with no firm timeline for when it will start taking patients. \nDr Daly said he shared the AMA's frustrations over delays in commissioning PCH. \n\"We're all intensely disappointed that we haven't moved yet and that we still don't have a confirmed date for the completion of the hospital, or for the move,\" he said. \n\"We hope it's close but we don't know, and that's incredibly frustrating for all 3,500 staff. \n\"When we get into the new hospital, which is such a beautiful working environment, I hope that everybody will feel much more comfortable.\" \nBut the AMA warned the move to the new facility would do little to soothe the mood of doctors unless administrators took their concerns to heart. \n\"The hospital is the team that run it,\" he said. \n\"You can run a hospital in a warehouse if you have to, if you've got the right doctors and nurses and other staff. So it's all about the team. \n\"But the focus has been on this shiny new lovely building. \n\"The building is just what you house your team in, and at the moment the team is in complete disarray.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:24:07.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
