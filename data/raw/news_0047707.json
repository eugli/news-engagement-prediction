Get what you need today in this early-morning email. A large portion of the money will help expand the Northampton school’s curriculum and facilities, according to a statement.\nThe school’s “Reminaging the Liberal Arts” initiative will use $184 million on new professorships; new majors, including Middle East studies and statistical and data sciences; and new facilities, including the Jill Ker Conway Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center.\nAnother $181 million will support annual operating costs and other initiatives, Schmeidel said. More than $100 million will go to financial aid, with most of that set aside for more than 100 new scholarships. About $10 million will go toward establishing new scholarships by matching donations of $250,000 or more.\nAdvertisement\n“At its heart, this campaign was all about women — their education, their leadership, their history, and their future,” McCartney said.\n“Smith is a stronger, better institution because of what we have accomplished, and the world is forever going to benefit from the leadership, creativity and entrepreneurship of the women we graduate.”\nSmith launched the campaign in October 2012.\nAndrew Grant can be reached at andrew.grant@globe.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Fsmith-college-announces-record-fund-raising%2FVB9UfHYWq1MWGgc11SHeXI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tSmith", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Smith", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Fsmith-college-announces-record-fund-raising%2FVB9UfHYWq1MWGgc11SHeXI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Fsmith-college-announces-record-fund-raising%2FVB9UfHYWq1MWGgc11SHeXI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Smith", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Fsmith-college-announces-record-fund-raising%2FVB9UfHYWq1MWGgc11SHeXI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Smith"], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:20:45.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
