Photo: Andrew Meares \nOne change flagged to the capital gains tax would see the concession reduced from 50 per cent to 25 per cent, or a similar amount. An alternative model would see the concession increase the longer the property is owned, reaching 50 per cent after several years. \nIn recent days, the government has threatened that tax hikes could be necessary to bring the budget into balance and fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme if $13 billion worth of spending cuts continue to be blocked in Parliament. \nTreasurer Scott Morrison told Fairfax Media the government would \"exhaust every option we have to deal with the expenditure problem we have\" and then finalise the 2017 budget measures. The priority is to reduce the deficit and hang onto to Australia's AAA credit rating. \nAccording to the Grattan Institute , halving the CGT concession would bring in $3.7 billion a year and have a small impact on house prices. \nLabor frontbencher Tony Burke said the opposition would look at the proposal \"if it's a step in the right direction\" and accused the government of hypocrisy and a \"scare campaign\". \n\"Be in no doubt you cannot allow the situation to continue where the government is giving more help to somebody buying their tenth home than to a first home buyer,\" Mr Burke told Sky News. \n\"Labor has been arguing this now for more than a year. If the government's getting closer to the mark, that's good, but no one should pretend that Scott Morrison emerged with any credibility.\" \nWith Tom McIlroy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:11:30.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
