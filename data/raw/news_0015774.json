As nationwide protests continue against President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration, corporate America, too, is finding its voice. On Sunday night leaders from 97 companies, the vast majority in the tech industry, filed an amicus brief in opposition to Trump’s immigration ban, calling his order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries “unlawful” and arguing it would inflict “substantial harm on American business, innovation, and growth.” The brief emphasizes the immigration laws and controls the U.S. already has in place, criticizes the haphazard rollout of the ban over the past week, and argues that Trump’s ban makes it harder for American companies to recruit and compete. “Immigrants make many of the nation’s greatest discoveries, and create some of the country’s most innovative and iconic companies,” the brief says. “America has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants—through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country.” The near-unified opposition of Silicon Valley is the latest in a series of setbacks for the Trump White House. On Friday, a federal judge in Seattle lifted the travel ban temporarily, forcing the Department of Homeland Security to stop enforcing the order and to reverse the revocation of tens of thousands of otherwise valid visas. Despite the Trump administration’s protestations, and an attempt by the Justice Department to obtain a stay, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the government’s argument on Sunday, leaving the Seattle judge’s ruling in place. Polls show that the majority of Americans oppose Trump’s travel ban , and businesses—particularly those in the tech industry that rely on high-skill immigrants—have taken notice. Apple, Google, Twitter, Microsoft, Facebook, Snap, Uber, Airbnb, and Lyft were among the dozens of tech companies that signed on to the amicus brief Sunday, alongside companies from other industries, including Levi Strauss and yogurt-maker Chobani. Absent from the list were Yahoo, Hewlett-Packard, Palantir, IBM, and Oracle. Amazon did not sign the amicus brief but joined Expedia in adding their voices to a separate legal challenge filed by the state attorney general of Washington last week. Amazon has been a core part of the Attorney General's action since the beginning, with its own filing in support of the original lawsuit, an Amazon spokesperson told Vanity Fair . The Attorney General preferred that Amazon not join the amicus brief since the company is a witness in the original lawsuit. Trump’s presidency, and his immigration executive order in particular, has presented a vexing challenge for C-suites and corporate P.R. shops around the country, with executives wary of becoming the target of either protesters or the president. During the Super Bowl on Sunday night, several advertisements featured subtle, if charged, political messages, including a Google advertisement that highlighted images of gay couples and religious minorities, and a stirring Budweiser advertisement that focused on the company’s immigrant founders. Airbnb, which has been among the most vocal opponents of Trump’s ban, ran an ad urging Americans to embrace ethnic and religious differences. The San Francisco-based startup, which is valued at $30 billion, also announced a goal to provide short-term housing around the world for 100,000 people in need over the next five years. “We’ll start with refugees, disaster survivors, and relief workers, though we want to accommodate many more types of displaced people over time,” the ad said. “To help people around the world facing displacement, we'll work with our community of hosts to find not just a place to stay, but also a place to feel connected, respected, and a part of a community again.” But striking the right tone is a difficult task, and other companies have stumbled in their responses. Uber, which was among the companies that signed the amicus brief, reacted clumsily in the first 24 hours after Trump’s ban went into effect, inciting outrage on social media. While Uber quickly addressed the situation by speaking out more forcefully and offering legal and financial support to its drivers, some 200,000 people reportedly deleted their accounts amid the controversy. C.E.O. Travis Kalanick later abandoned his position on a White House economic advisory board, citing his objection to the ban. Tesla and SpaceX C.E.O. Elon Musk took a different tack, defending his decision to remain on the same board as for “the greater good.” In a series of tweets Saturday, Musk wrote that he had raised the issue of climate change at the board’s first meeting, and would continue to do so. “Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?” he added . This story has been updated.
