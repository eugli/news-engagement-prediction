The only difference was that the Pentagon video had English subtitles added, he said.\nPentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said the video was still of worth, even if it may have been created earlier.\n'It does not matter when the video was made, that they had it is still illustrative of who they are and what their intentions are,' Davis said.\nMedics at the scene in al Bayda - south central Yemen - said about 30 people, including 10 women and children, were killed\nA US Central Command spokesman confirmed that the video (pictured) was removed from the website because the contents were old\nUS Navy SEAL William 'Ryan' Owens was killed in the raid, which the Pentagon said also killed 14 militants. The 8-year-old daughter of militant Anwar al-Awlaki, Nawar, was also killed that day. Medics at the scene said about 30 people, including 10 women and children, died.\nMilitary officials told Reuters this week that the operation went ahead without sufficient intelligence, ground support or adequate backup preparations.\nAs a result, three officials said, the attacking SEAL team found itself dropping onto a reinforced al Qaeda base defended by landmines, snipers, and a larger than expected contingent of heavily armed Islamist extremists.\nBut Central Command said earlier this week that it only asks for operations it believes have a good chance of success based on its planning. Pentagon spokesman Davis has said the element of surprise had not been lost in the raid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T13:47:01.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
