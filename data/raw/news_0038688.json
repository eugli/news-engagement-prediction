Trump defended his former national security adviser Michael Flynn during a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But he did not answer any questions about a new bombshell report on his campaign’s dealings with Russia.\nTrump said he thought Flynn was a “wonderful man” who had been treated “very, very unfairly by the media, as I call it, the fake media, in many cases.”\nAdvertisement\nHe also decried leaks to the media, saying that documents and papers had been “illegally leaked.”\n“People are trying to cover up for a terrible loss the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton,” he said.\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.
