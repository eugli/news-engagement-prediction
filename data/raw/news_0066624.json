'More times than she could count' \nThe 53-year-old doctor, who has treated Olympic gymnasts, is accused by more than 60 former patients and athletes of sexual abuse during pelvic procedures. \nHe was stripped of his medical licence last month, amid at least six criminal and civil lawsuits. \nDr Nassar was fired in September after working for decades as a doctor for gymnasts at Michigan State University, as well as USA Gymnastics - the sport's governing body. Image copyright AP Image caption Olympian Jamie Dantzscher told CBS that Dr Nassar had abused her during treatment \nThe new charges relate to work he did at Michigan State University's Sports medicine clinic and at a gymnastics club called Geddert's Twistars in Eaton County. \nParents were either asked to leave the room while the abuse took place or Dr Nassar used a sheet or stood in a position to block any view, police said. \nA girl identified as Victim B, now 21, said she was sexually assaulted by Dr Nassar \"more times than she could count,\" Det Sgt Andrea Munford wrote in an affidavit. \nVictim B said \"all the gymnasts trusted Nassar and that he was like a god to the gymnasts\", she added. Allegations increasing \n\"This guy is disgusting. This guy is despicable,'' said Mr Schuette. \"Dr Nassar used his status and authority to engage in horrid sexual assaults under the guise of medical procedures.\" \nDr Nassar's lawyers declined media requests for comment on Wednesday, but he has previously denied abuse. \nPolice say allegations against him continue to increase almost daily. Three former members of the US gymnastics team described their experiences on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" show on Sunday.
