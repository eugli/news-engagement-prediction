Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images   Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images President Trump nominated federal appellate judge Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee. If confirmed, it would tilt the balance of the court back in conservatives' favor.\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Politics President Trump Nominates Neil Gorsuch To The Supreme Court Politics Who Is Neil Gorsuch, Trump's First Pick For The Supreme Court? Judge Gorsuch was a very traditional pick from President Trump, one any Republican president could have made. He teased reality show, but it was standard fare. That stood out in what's been a chaotic start to this presidency. Liberals are demanding resistance, but Gorsuch will be tough to stop — he has sterling legal credentials, been confirmed once by the Senate and, above all, Democrats have little leverage. They might want a pound of flesh — an eye for a Garland eye — but to what end? GOP leader Mitch McConnell could blow up the filibuster and get through anyone.\nI have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court. It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8:00 P.M. (W.H.)\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 Turn to https://t.co/aR80UqQ2gY at 8pm EST where @POTUS will announce his nomination to the United States Supreme Court.\n— Justice Hardiman (@JusticeHardiman) January 31, 2017 A special thank you to @POTUS . As Mr. Trump's Supreme Court nominee I promise to always do what is best for the American People. #SCOTUS pic.twitter.com/v2N3OCBhyj \n— Justice Neil Gorsuch (@JusticeNGorsuch) February 1, 2017 SCOTUS justice must stand up to a Pres willing to bend the Constitution. Serious doubts on Judge Gorsuch’s ability to meet this standard.\n— Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) February 1, 2017 Judge Gorsuch must explain his hostility to women's rights, support of corporations over workers and opposition to campaign finance reform.\n— Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) February 1, 2017 WATCH → Neil Gorsuch will be a great #SCOTUS Justice. I applaud @POTUS for his excellent pick to our nation's highest court. pic.twitter.com/jCkto6kAs1 \n— Leader McConnell (@SenateMajLdr) February 1, 2017 Gorsuch is excellent choice. Like Scalia in many ways but with a lighter touch. Also less deferential to administrative agencies. Well done.\n— Ilya Shapiro (@ishapiro) February 1, 2017 Absent a shock revelation, Gorsuch is sure to be confirmed. Republicans already have the votes and he will get some Democratic support too.\n— SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) February 1, 2017 Hope you like my nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the United States Supreme Court. He is a good and brilliant man, respected by all.\n— Donald J.
