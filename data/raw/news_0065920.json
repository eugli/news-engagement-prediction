Source: istock\nUnder the new changes, approved importers will now be able to buy the medication from overseas and store it in Australia for immediate distribution until domestic production meets local needs.\nThe move will make it easier for patients who now must wait for the product to be imported once prescribed an authorised doctor.\nStrict rules and regulations surrounding the drug remain in place, meaning not just anyone can access it.\nCurrently the drug is sourced from overseas but the changes would see it cultivated locally with imports fast-tracked while local supplies are grown.\nWHERE TO FROM HERE?\nIt is expected Australia will have a store of imported medicinal cannabis products within eight weeks. That is expected to help fill the gap until local production — which was legalised late last year — ramps up.\nBut Mr Hunt said local production will take time to develop.\nOnce approved, commercial importers will be allowed to source medicinal cannabis products from a reputable international supplier and store it in a secure warehouse.\nThe first licence for private cultivation was only issued last week. Victoria expects locally-sourced medicinal cannabis to be available by the middle of the year or a little bit later.\nThe health minister said those with profound conditions or palliative care needs will instead be able to access safe, high-quality and appropriately-obtained medication within days.\n“It is time that they have the care that they need, the drugs that are prescribed by medical professionals, and that they are actually available,” he said.\nMinister for Health Greg Hunt during Question Time in the House of Representatives at Parliament House in Canberra, Monday, Feb. 13, 2017. (AAP Image/Mick Tsikas) NO ARCHIVING Source: AAP\nWHO BENEFITS?\nAccording to Katoomba-based GP Teresa Towpik, the benefits could extend beyond ill patients.\nSpeaking to news.com.au, Dr Towpik said the drug could be grown locally, which could have massive rewards for farmers, distributors and even pickers.\n“Why are we importing it, when we could grow own ethically sourced drug here?” she said.\nThe GP, who admits she comes from a conservative background, said she was excited by the benefits the drug could have for patients who previously had to wait a long time for treatment.\nBut she said more education was needed and it wasn’t a case of “people smoking bongs” whenever they wanted.\nDr Towpik, who will give a talk on the potential benefits of the drug at Australia’s Hemp Health & Innovation (HHI) Expo & Symposium 2017 in May, said patients still had to undergo a full assessment and not just anyone could be prescribed medical marijuana.\n“I’m very excited by this,” she said.\n“I really feel this has tremendous benefits for patients, especially those with chronic pain, as well as providing pain relief for cancer patients.\n“I’m quite amazed at the potential it has but know many GPs remain cautious. I think it’s worth looking into further.”\nHOW DO YOU GET IT?\nDr Towpik said not just anyone was entitled to the drug and patients had to undergo a rigorous assessment to obtain it.\nPatients require a letter from their GP, and must also get an importation permit from the Therapeutic Goods Administration.\n“There’s a lot of paperwork involved, so it’s not as easy as it may sound,” she said.\nShe also said not all GPs would feel comfortable prescribing it.\nDr Towpik said along with eduction of both doctors and patients, there also had to be an easy streamlined process involved from prescribing down to distribution.\n“There is still a lot of learning to be done,” she said.\nHOW IS IT TAKEN?\nDr Towpik said patients who used the drug took it as an oil or vaporiser form.\n“It shouldn’t be smoked, that can increase bronchial irritations and reduce the potency,” she said.\ndebra.killalea@news.com.au\nCannabis Oil users will find it easier to access the drug thanks to sweeping changes announced today.
