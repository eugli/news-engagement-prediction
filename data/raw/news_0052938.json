I think it’s wonderful, if they’re happy. If they’re happy – I’m in favour of it,” he said. \nMr Trump’s about-turn follows previous criticisms levelled at the 28-member bloc for acting as a “vehicle for Germany” . \nHe has also predicted that other member states would leave the EU. \nMr Trump said during an interview in January: “You look at the European Union and it’s Germany. Basically a vehicle for Germany. That’s why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out.” \nWhite House chief strategist and close aide to Mr Trump Steve Bannon is also understood to be an ardent Eurosceptic, reportedly telling one German diplomat during a recent meeting that the EU was a flawed concept. \nHe also suggested the US under Mr Trump favoured conducting bilateral negotiations. \nBut Vice President Mike Pence has attempted to strike a different tone, saying during a recent visit to Europe that he and the President looked forward to working with the EU to “deepen our political and economic partnership”. \nLeaders of the EU have raised their own concerns about Mr Trump’s suspicion of Brussels, with Martin Schulz, the former president of the European Parliament, describing his election victory as a “very difficult moment” for the continent.
