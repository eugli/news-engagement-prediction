The situation is described by our spy as “a power struggle between two senior advisers” Kushner and former Breitbart chief, Steve Bannon. \n“Everyone is working 24/7, but Jared, because of his religious views, not only can’t be in the White House, but can’t be on his phone, can’t drive his car, can’t listen to the radio — he can’t be reached,” says our whistleblower. Observant Jews are prohibited from working between sunset Friday and sunset Saturday.\nWe’re told that advisors sympathetic to Bannon,63, have labeled Kushner, 36, “green” and “soft” and fear that his perceived timidity brings the president to a less hawkish place.\nSteve Bannon architect of travel ban from Muslim countries \nPolitical novice Jared Kushner, a senior advisor to the President, was observing the Jewish Sabbath during last week's executive order on the travel ban.

That wasn’t the case last Friday, when all hell broke loose after the President’s unexpected executive order threw the nation’s airports into chaos.\nWhite House advisor Steve Bannon is shaping up to be a hardball operative (Evan Vucci/AP) We’re also told that Kushner and Ivanka were surprised at the backlash last weekend when they posted a glamorous social media photo of the two of them preparing to go out Saturday night — apparently unaware of what had unfolded while they were observing the Sabbath.\nTrump controversies come while Kushner observing Shabbat :report \nThe photo has since been labeled Ivanka’s “Marie Antoinette Moment.” \nTrump administration reps could not immediately be reached for comment.\nWith Brian Niemietz \nTags: stephen bannon jared kushner donald trump donald trump first 100 days Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:55:29.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
