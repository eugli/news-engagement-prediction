But Punjab’s netas seem to know how to unwind. While some have taken to foreign shores and detox treatments, at least one is using the break to eat home-grown strawberries and write a book. \nVoting to elect a new government in the state was held on February 4 and results will be declared only on March 11. \nStand-up comedian Bhagwant Mann, who addressed nearly 1,000 rallies as a star campaigner for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the run-up to the polls, is “detoxifying” in Bengaluru with party chief Arvind Kejriwal. \nKejriwal had tweeted missives to the Election Commission about “lapses” in guarding of EVMs in Punjab before heading for a strict detoxification regime at a naturopathy centre in Bengaluru. \n“Kejriwal and Durgesh Pathak went to the centre last week. Mann joined them after three days,” an AAP source said. Stand-up comedian Bhagwant Mann (in yellow turban) is “detoxifying” in Bengaluru with AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal. (PTI) \nCourting both the AAP and the Congress in Punjab is not a joke. But actor Kapil Sharma is doing so and how. \nAfter high-octane campaigning in his seat Batala, Punjab AAP convener Gurpreet Singh Waraich aka Ghuggi is busy shooting for a Punjabi movie in Mohali, being produced by Kapil Sharma. \n“I am trying to complete pending projects. Currently, I am shooting for a Punjabi remake of a Marathi movie with Kapil Sharma,” Ghuggi told HT. \nBack in Mumbai, Kapil has been humouring Navjot Singh Sidhu, Congress’ new poster-boy, who has returned to his comedy show after the whirlwind campaigning in Punjab, saying he would soon be sitting on a “bigger seat” (read government post). \nThe father-son Badal duo are using the break for attending to health and family. \nChief minister Parkash Singh Badal, who was admitted to the PGI, Chandigarh, twice in the last one year, is expected to return from the US on February 17 after a “thorough medical examination”. \nHis son and deputy CM, Sukhbir Badal, and daughter-in-law, Union minister Harsimrat Badal, are also in the US with family and will return on February 20, a week before the Delhi Gurdwara Management Committee (DGMC) elections on February 26. Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal is in the US for medical treatment. (PTI ) \nOne of the Badal ministers, Janmeja Singh Sekhon, has publicly announced that “they need rest” after running the government for two terms. \n“Sarkar vich bohut mehnat kiti ae. Thakke thukke hoye aa. Relax hon layi family te team nu Bangkok, Hong Kong te Dubai de tour te le chale aa (We have been in the government and are tired. I am taking family and team to Bangkok, Hong Kong and Dubai for a vacation),” Sekhon is heard saying in a YouTube clip posted by a Punjabi news channel. Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh is busy relishing home-grown strawberries in his Sector 10 residence in Chandigarh while preparing for two book releases. (PTI) \nAs for the Congress CM face, Captain Amarinder Singh, it is time to nurse a bruised ankle. \nAdvised rest, the state party chief is spending time relishing home-grown strawberries in his Sector 10 residence in Chandigarh while preparing for two book releases. The first, an authorised biography on him — The People’s Maharaja — is slated for February 21 release. Then comes wedding of his grandson, Nirvan, in the first week of March. \nAlso set for release before the election verdict is Amarinder’s account of the Battle of Saragarhi, on how 36 Sikh Regiment fought Afridi tribals in Pakistan’s North West Frontier Province in 1897. \nWiser from the 2012 polls, when the former Patiala royal and his team had “appointed” loyalists as cabinet ministers and blue-eyed officers on plum posts before the results, the Captain is not jumping the gun this time. \nIt is safer to stick to history. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:45.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
