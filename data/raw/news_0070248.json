It was the Indian cricket team captain’s fifth duck in Tests.(BCCI ) \nAs has often been the case with Indian batsmen who walk back after the fall of India’s second wicket, Cheteshwar Pujara, too, headed back as the crowd at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium gave a rousing welcome to the next batsman. ( LIVE BLOG | LIVE SCORECARD ) \nVirat Kohli walked in, took guard, but all of that cheering and chanting of his name came to an abrupt halt just after two deliveries. He had scored his fifth duck in Test cricket.
