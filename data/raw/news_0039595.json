Incase \nI carry my company-issued MacBook Air to and from work most weekdays, so it's paramount I keep it safe. The last thing I need is to break an expensive laptop that isn't technically mine. \nWhile I'm not necessarily prone to clumsiness, I am human, so six months ago I decided to take a preventative measure to protect my most important piece of tech in case it falls or comes into contact with water. It was something I should have done sooner , but better late than never. \nI reached out to Incase — knowing their tech accessories have an excellent reputation — to see if I could try out one of their laptop cases. Since getting the company's hardshell case , I have so much more peace of mind when I'm commuting with my laptop in tow. \nThe case is very slim, but sturdy, and is easy to take on and off. Once on, though, it stays securely put. It does add a little bulk to the MacBook Air, but it's not something that bothers me, or that I even really notice. I carry my laptop in a tote bag every day, but even if you stow yours in a smaller pouch, I doubt the case's extra bulk would prevent your laptop from fitting in it. \nI've also gotten a bunch of compliments on the case, because in addition to serving a very practical purpose, it looks good. It comes in seven great colors ; I have the \"Blue Moon\" color. \nNow, some people reading this probably think laptop cases are superfluous purchases, and to that I say I used to be one of them. But try thinking about it this way: You're spending $50 to protect a $1,000-plus piece of tech. And you've probably already spent a similar amount to protect your iPhone. Laptop cases and phone cases are both working toward the same goal. \nSo do yourself a favor and get a case for your laptop if it's still bare. It could end up saving you big time. \nIncase's hardshell case is available for the following six MacBook models and sells for $50: Pro Retina 15\", Pro Retina 13\", Pro 13\", Air 13\", 12\", and Air 11\". \nYou can check out all of Incase's hardshell MacBook cases here.
