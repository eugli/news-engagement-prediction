And it's actually even more impressive when realizing that Auli'i Cravalho was hit in the head while performing at the Oscars by one of the dancers spinning behind her. Not only did she manage to barely react to the hit, but she also flawlessly continued her song without missing a note. And as she went on, she performed so well that you wouldn't even realize that at only 16, she was far, far younger than all of the other live musical performers on Oscar night. If she had any nerves, they weren't visible, and she belted out the notes in \"How Far I'll Go.\" \nSeriously, watch the video and without looking super close at the moment where Cravalho is knocked by one of those flag batons designed to create some sort of oceanic motif onstage, it basically comes across as imperceptible based on her vocal performance. It's almost enough to make you think that somehow, this was all part of the plan. Like, the girl doesn't even blink. She's that good. Consider this the official new #unbothered gif. Auili'i Cravalho got hit in the head by a flag and kept going like a champ #Oscars pic.twitter.com/onS3dvCBfY ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:19:38.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
