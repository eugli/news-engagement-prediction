His sinister acting sends chills down viewers’ spines every episode. \nOff screen, he makes a complete turn from his villainous role and shows his cute side by making a “V” sign and sending finger hearts at the camera. What’s more, according to reports, the “Defendant” staff are calling him the official cutie at the filming site, thanks to his jokes and adorable facial expressions. \nMeanwhile, on the previous episode of “Defendant,” Jung Woo ( Ji Sung ) and Min Ho (Uhm Ki Joon) displayed strong tension as they started sharing the same prison cell. \n“Defendant” airs every Monday and Tuesday.
