During the U.S. election race, Trump branded the accord \"the worst deal ever negotiated\", telling voters he would either rip it up or seek a better agreement.\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:35:31.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
