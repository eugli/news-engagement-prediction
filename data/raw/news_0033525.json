State coach Mark Gottfried to be fired A North Carolina television station is reporting that N.C. State's Mark Gottfried will be fired after the season. — Mark Armstrong (@ArmstrongABC11) February 13, 2017 N.C. State coach Mark Gottfried will be fired after the season, according to a report from ABC11’s Mark Armstrong. Armstrong cited “multiple sources, independent of each other,” in reporting that N.C. State made a decision over the weekend to fire Gottfried at season’s end. The report comes after N.C. State (14-12, 3-10) was blasted 88-58 by a Wake Forest team that entered the game 5-7 in ACC play. After the game, Gottfried told CBS Sports he wasn’t worried about his job status. \"Truthfully, I'm not paying attention to any of that,\" Gottfried told CBS Sports. \"I haven't had any discussions with anyone at NC State about that. I plan on being here for a long time.\" Gottfried is 122-81 at N.C. State, but the program has been trending downward. He made the NCAA Tournament in each of his first four seasons, only to go 16-17 last year. Many felt that this year’s Wolfpack would be a sleeper team with the No. 4 recruiting class in the 247Sports Composite, including a pair of five-star talents in Dennis Smith Jr. and Omer Yurtseven. Instead, they’re currently on a five-game losing streak, with the 30-point loss to Wake Forest serving as the worst defeat ever in Winston Salem.
