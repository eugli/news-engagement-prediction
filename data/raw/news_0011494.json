Steve Bannon: 'We're going to war in the South China Sea ... no doubt' Read more \nBeijing’s public reaction to Trump’s rise has so far been cautious, although state-run English-language newspapers have accused him of “playing with fire” by questioning longstanding US policy on Taiwan and one nationalist tabloid has warned of “large-scale war” . \nLast month China’s foreign ministry urged the president’s team to “speak and act cautiously” after the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, vowed the US would foil Chinese efforts to “take over” the South China Sea. \nIn a diplomatically worded editorial published on page three of the People’s Daily domestic edition on Monday, the voice of the Communist party said both countries should strive to avoid confrontation, conflict, misunderstandings and miscalculations. \nDifferences of opinion were inevitable due to the historical, cultural, economic and social differences between the US and China, the article said, “but wise men should seek common ground”. The article was printed under the byline “Zhong Sheng”, a homonym for “Voice of China”. \nThe broadsheet noted that both countries’ leaders were waging high-profile campaigns to improve the lives of their citizens: Xi’s “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” and Trump’s battle to “make America great again”.

They want to manage it carefully so it doesn’t needlessly escalate,” said Medeiros, who is now the managing director for Asia at the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group . \nMedeiros said China’s leaders had at first seen Trump’s victory as a boon, wagering the property tycoon would not challenge it over human rights. \nHowever, attitudes had now shifted from nervousness about the US president’s erratic tweeting to resignation that a “difficult period” in relations was now afoot. “The possibilities for an escalation of tensions are growing because distrust is high,” the article said. Trump risks 'war' with Beijing if US blocks access to South China Sea, state media warns Read more \nSusan Shirk, the head of the 21st Century China Centre at the University of California, San Diego, said China specialists were “flummoxed” at Trump’s apparent determination to take on Beijing and said such moves came at an unfortunate time. \nPresident Xi will reach the midway point of his anticipated decade in power this autumn, a highly sensitive and symbolic moment that will be marked by the 19th Communist party Congress in Beijing. \nWith an intense period of political jockeying now under way before that key summit, Shirk said she feared that, in order to protect his domestic position, Xi might be tempted “to push back very strongly” against what he would perceive as Trump’s attempts to humiliate him. \n“As a person who sees a very strong connection between Chinese domestic politics and its foreign policy, I see the Trump statements as resonating through Chinese foreign policy in a way that could really be dangerous,” said Shirk, the author of China: Fragile Superpower \n“It’s a pretty scary moment in American foreign policy as well as domestic policy. But with domestic policy I do feel there are more checks and balances. In foreign policy he can create a lot of chaos out of the White House,” Shirk added. \nAdditional reporting by Wang Zhen ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T12:11:20.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
