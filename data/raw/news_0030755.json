(Andy Jacobsohn/The   SportsDayDFW.com Contact SportsDayDFW.com on Twitter: @SportsDayDFW \nIt was tough to watch â€” when Rangers DH Prince Fielder tearfully announced his retirement from the game of baseball due to medical issues. \nSurrounded by his two sons, Jadyn and Haven, Fielder was forced to give up the game he loved much too soon after his second spinal fusion surgery. 'I thought I was just going to cry in the car': Emotional Prince Fielder says goodbye to baseball \nFor many professional athletes, life after sports can be difficult to navigate. For Fielder, though, it hasn't taken long for him to find his stride. \nIn an interview with ESPN's Jerry Crasnick, Fielder discussed what he's been up to in the six months from his retirement announcement . \n\"I'm just living a normal life -- a regular life, as people would call it. I'm enjoying it. I'm still working out. It keeps me feeling good about things. I get to kind of pretend I'm going to play baseball. I get to work out and do all the stuff that was part of baseball. I just don't get to play.\" \nFielder has other activities to keep him busy as well including a new cooking show with his wife called \"Fielder's Choice\" \n\"I have a food show that's going to be streaming on Netflix and Hulu. It's coming out around the beginning of spring training in March, I believe. It's not just baseball people. It's a mixture of baseball people, actors, musicians, chefs and whatnot. They bring out different dishes, and at the end of the show, I give the one I like the most the \"Fielder's choice.\" It's good TV.\" \n\"How did that come about,\" Crasnick asked. \n\" A friend of mine asked me a question at the end of 2015. We were going over my finances and setting things up for the future when she said, 'What do you want to do when you retire?' I said, 'I always wanted to do a food show.' I thought it might be a cool thing to do when I retired a few years later. Then retirement came slightly prematurely.\" \nThe entire Q&A with Fielder dives into how the former DH plans to help the Rangers in 2017, his relationship with his father and what he'll miss most about baseball among several other topics.
