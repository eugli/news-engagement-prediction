A family friend says this is a picture of the 24-year-old.

Well, we still don't know, and that's what makes us so upset and angry. It's how could this happen?\"\nChampagne said she and her siblings grew up in social housing, but they all worked their way out, including her brother, who did freelance music and graphic design work.\nWhen Boucher was 14-years-old, he began working with Tammy Hogan, a frontline crisis worker at Christie Lake Kids, which offers community and camp programs to disadvantaged youth.\nHogan told CBC News by the time Boucher was 16-years-old, he had graduated out of the program, and began mentoring other youth who faced the same struggles he had.\n'Light up a kid's day' Hogan said Boucher volunteered hundreds of hours of his time over the last eight years.\n\"He was magical working with at-risk kids.
