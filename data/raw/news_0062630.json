[ NY Times ] \nThis is a tiny oversight, right? Kind of thing that can happen to anybody, yeah? \nUntil now, national regulations have made it difficult for the authorities to stop benefit payments to a suspected militant, even if the person had been identified by the intelligence services as an ISIS fighter . Officials said investigating the circumstances of individuals in Syria or Iraq was logistically challenging. \nIn case you didn’t catch that: Even if Danish intelligence spots you jihad -ing your way across the Levant, RPG-launcher on your shoulder, sex slaves in tow, the Danish government will still have a hard time cutting off your government check. \nThe thing about managerial liberalism is that it only works when the managers are competent . When news like this emerges, you start to see how voters could start looking around for something — maybe anything — else.
