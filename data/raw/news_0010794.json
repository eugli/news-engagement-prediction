The impact they have made in social and economic growth is there for all to see. \n\"Aside from that, the Chinese people have always been loyal to the state and federal government. That is also a fact that we can all see,\" he said. \nTaib added that he is pleased to see that the Chinese are playing an active role in government administration. He further urged them to continue keeping faith in the leadership. \nTaib also praised the late Tan Sri Adenan Satem. \nHe said that Adenan had performed very well in leading Sarawak during the three years he was chief minister. \n\"We feel sad over his demise but he has left a legacy for every other future leader in Sarawak to emulate,\" said Taib.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:49:35.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
