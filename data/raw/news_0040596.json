But Trump isn’t on board, according the Post’s story, which quotes an ESPN spokesperson: “We expressed our interest to the White House in continuing the presidential bracket. They have respectfully declined.” \nWhite House spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email to The Washington Post: “We look forward to working with ESPN on another opportunity in the near future.” Neither the White House nor ESPN had any details on what other opportunities might lie down the road. \nThe news didn’t exactly come as a surprise to ESPN executives. They knew with a change of president, the annual feature might not continue. Obama hosted an ESPN crew each March and filled out brackets for both the men’s and women’s tournaments. Two of those brackets are now property of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. \nWhereas Obama is a huge basketball fan -- he played often while in office -- Trump has shown no ties to hoops. He does like to golf, however. \nTrump first attended Fordham University, then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania. Neither university’s basketball team is on pace to make this year’s NCAA Tournament . \nThis year’s NCAA Tournament begins March 14 with the First Four in Dayton, Ohio. The Final Four will be held in Phoenix for the first time, with games on April 1 and 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:15:51.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
