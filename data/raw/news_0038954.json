He was arrested on Friday night in Selangor state, the police said in a statement. He is the fourth suspect to be arrested in the investigations surrounding the murder in Kuala Lumpur on Monday. \nAuthorities are investigating whether Indonesian woman Siti Aisyah and another female suspect killed the 46-year-old North Korean exile in a shopping concourse at the international airport. \nOn Friday night, Malaysia performed a second autopsy on the estranged half brother of North Korea’s leader because the first procedure was inconclusive. \nThe second autopsy clearly enraged North Korea , which has vowed to reject the results of any procedure and demanded that Malaysia turn over the body immediately. Speaking to reporters outside the morgue late on Friday, Pyongyang’s ambassador said Malaysian officials may be “trying to conceal something” and “colluding with hostile forces”. \nKim Jong Nam, who was 45 or 46 and had lived in exile for years, suddenly fell ill at the Kuala Lumpur airport on Monday as he waited for a flight home to Macau. Dizzy and in pain, he told medical workers at the airport he had been sprayed with a chemical. He died while being taken to a hospital. \nSuspect Siti Aisyah, 25, was duped into thinking she was part of a comedy show prank, Indonesia’s national police chief has said, citing information received from Malaysian authorities. Indonesia’s national police chief, Tito Karnavian, told reporters in Indonesia’s Aceh province she and another woman performed stunts which involved convincing men to close their eyes and then spraying them with water. \n“Such an action was done three or four times and they were given a few dollars for it, and with the last target, Kim Jong-nam, allegedly there were dangerous materials in the sprayer,” Karnavian said. “She was not aware that it was an assassination attempt by alleged foreign agents.” \nSiti’s family have said they were shocked to hear of her involvement in the case, describing her as a struggling mother who had travelled to Malaysia for work. \nMalaysia is one of just a handful of countries to have full diplomatic ties with North Korea, with each country having an embassy in the other’s capital. Malaysia has also been a key place for quiet, semi-official “track two” diplomatic talks between North Korea and the US. \nMalaysia said on Friday it wanted DNA samples from Kim Jong-nam’s family as part of the autopsy procedure and that officials were not yet willing to hand the body to the North Koreans. Although Kim Jong-nam is believed to have two sons and a daughter with two women living in Beijing and Macau, police in Malaysia say none has come forward to claim the body or provide DNA samples. \n“If there is no claim by next-of-kin and upon exhausting all avenues [to obtain DNA], we will finally then hand over the body to the [North Korean] embassy,” said Abdul Samah Mat, a senior Malaysian police official. He would not say how long that process might take. \nKim Jong-nam was estranged from his younger half-brother, the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. He reportedly fell out of favour with their father, the late Kim Jong-il, in 2001, when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport to visit Tokyo Disneyland. \nAssociated Press and Reuters contributed to this report ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T07:06:24.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
