While these definitions don't contradict each other, they do vary in how inclusive they are. The most common definitions of acids and bases are Arrhenius acids and bases, Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases, and Lewis acids and bases. Antoine Lavoisier , Humphry Davy, and Justus Liebig also made observations regarding acids and bases, but didn't formalize definitions. Svante Arrhenius Acids and Bases \nThe Arrhenius theory of acids and bases dates back to 1884, building on his observation that salts, such as sodium chloride, dissociate into what he termed ions when placed into water. acids produce H + ions in aqueous solutions bases produce OH - ions in aqueous solutions water required, so only allows for aqueous solutions only protic acids are allowed; required to produce hydrogen ions Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted - Thomas Martin Lowry Acids and Bases \nThe Brønsted or Brønsted-Lowry theory describes acid-base reactions as an acid releasing a proton and a base accepting a proton. \ncontinue reading below our video 4 Tips for Improving Test Performance While the acid definition is pretty much the same as that proposed by Arrhenius (a hydrogen ion is a proton), the definition of what constitutes a base is much broader. acids are proton donors", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:48:49.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
