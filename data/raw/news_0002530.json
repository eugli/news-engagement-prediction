Guterres said such a ban “triggers widespread anxiety and anger that may facilitate the propaganda of the very terrorist organisations we all want to fight against” and that, furthermore, “blind measures, not based on solid intelligence, tend to be ineffective as they risk being bypassed by what are today sophisticated global terrorist movements”.\nBen Emmerson, the UN special rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights, said on Monday: “Trump’s executive order clearly breaches US international human rights obligations on non-refoulement and non-discrimination. It is unlawful.”\n“Apart from being in breach of international law, Trump’s Executive Order carries a risk of increasing rather reducing the risk of terrorism,” Emmerson said on Twitter on Tuesday evening.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T16:46:22.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
