By Carly Ledbetter \nMakeup, ***Flawless. \nMakeup and lip artist extraordinaire Jazmina Daniel recently recreated Beyoncé’s pregnancy announcement on her lips, and result is mind-blowing. In an Instagram post, Daniel said the artwork took her over four hours to recreate. \n“I know I have a lot of Queen 🐝 Fans out there! This one is for you! @beyonce Tag the Queen if you think she’d approve 🐝,” Daniel wrote. A post shared by Jazmina Daniel (@missjazminad) on Feb 23, 2017 at 6:41pm PST \nThe Beyhive is clearly crazy in love with the artwork. Fans couldn’t get over Daniel’s incredible talent, as well as the accuracy of the lip art. \n“OMG WHO IS SHE OMG OMG EVERYTHING,” one commenter wrote. Another added, “I can’t even apply lipstick properly like wtf?” \nDaniel, who is from Sydney, Australia, told The Huffington Post via email that her love for lip art started after she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. \n“I was at home sick every day and would turn to painting to keep my mind off things,” she said. “Slowly that painting would turn into makeup (face painting) which then led me to experiment with drawing something tiny on my lips. That was 5 years ago now and I’ve continued to love and do it since.” \nShe added, “I chose to recreate Bey’s pregnancy announcement because everyone was so excited about it. There were a lot of people recreating it in pictures and I know that a lot of my followers were Beyoncé fans so it just seemed right to do. I felt inspired in the moment to do it!” \nCheck out more of her gorgeous creations below: A post shared by Jazmina Daniel (@missjazminad) on Dec 8, 2016 at 6:16pm PST A post shared by Jazmina Daniel (@missjazminad) on Dec 26, 2016 at 8:22pm PST A post shared by Jazmina Daniel (@missjazminad) on Oct 4, 2016 at 7:08pm PDT A post shared by Jazmina Daniel (@missjazminad) on Feb 10, 2017 at 6:28pm PST A post shared by Jazmina Daniel (@missjazminad) on Jul 29, 2016 at 3:46pm PDT \nAnd bow down to Miss Jazmina!
