Kendall Jenner Nails This Throwback Fashion Trend February 24, 2017 10:18 PM by Maria Ward Photo: Getty Images The ’90s trend has been a thing for a while, but leave it to Kendall Jenner to offer the ultimate mic drop with a hip-hop-inspired moment at Milan Fashion Week . When the supermodel was seen on her way to the Versace runway earlier today , she clearly wasn’t afraid to pile on the throwback-style duds, starting with a vintage Ice Cube T-shirt. This is not the first time Jenner has paid homage to hip-hop; she recently wore a similar look , only with Tupac Shakur splashed across the front. Today, Jenner tucked The Predator rapper’s 1992 album merch into high-waisted black denim cinched with a leather belt for added so-bad-it’s-good swagger. While her baggy button-fly jeans were worn in all their slouchy-cool glory, they were cropped at just the right place to put a pair of optic white leather booties on full display. Jenner’s accessories up top also hit a retro note. She sported a zippered backpack slung over one shoulder, which recalled the Prada nylon carriers of a decade past. Angular frames added to the overall nostalgia that was right in line with the era’s streetwear obsession. We think Ice Cube would approve.
