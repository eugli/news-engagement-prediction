Rob Howley is a former Wales and British and Irish Lions scrum-half Coach Rob Howley says Wales' Six Nations title hopes are over after Scotland ended their 10-year losing streak against them at Murrayfield. \nWales led 13-9 at the break, but the hosts scored 20 unanswered points in the second period. \nHowley said he was \"hugely disappointed\" by his side's second half display. \n\"Our second half performance wasn't good enough. Scotland squeezed us,\" said Howley. \n\"We lacked possession and when we got it, Scotland were hugely effective in the contact area, slowing up our ball or getting turnovers. 'Scotland better and deserved win' \n\"Our changing room was positive at half time, but that didn't manifest second half. \n\"Losing today, our Championship is over but it's about pride in the next two games. \n\"Scotland were better than us and deserved the win.\" \nWales captain Alun Wyn Jones echoed Howley's thoughts, saying: \"We were efficient with our possession in the first half but there was a definite momentum shift. \n\"We didn't keep possession in the second half and they capitalised on their possession. \n\"Ultimately we fell short in the second half.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T19:25:27.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
