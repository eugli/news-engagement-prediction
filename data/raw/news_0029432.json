Tequila? Whiskey? Rum? Unclear, but perhaps we can thank whatever is in the flask for her very good, A-plus reaction faces during every camera pan—like when she found the men of 21 Pilots’s pants-less tribute to making it rather touching: \nhttps://twitter.com/TheBeyHiveTeam/status/830989528752074753 While the flask likely helped her make it through the three-and-a-half hour award show, it really got the rest of us through it as well. There's nothing quite like trying to spot Rih taking a quick swig to keep an audience engaged. Photos from the 2017 Grammy Awards Carpet Adele in Givenchy Adele’s influence is so powerful at this point, the name of this green hue has—we’ve been told—officially been changed to “Adele Green.” Photo: From Getty Images. Just another dull, understated, and sedate look from the one and only Lady Gaga. Photo: From Getty Images. Beyoncé What is there to even say? At this point, she can hardly even be classified as the same species as the rest of us. Photo: From Getty Images. Rihanna in Armani Privé and David Webb and Chopard Jewelry This Hallo-Rih-een-y look (sorry) is not going to be everyone’s favorite, but what’s so wonderful about Rihanna and her fashion is that: she doesn’t care what any of us think. Photo: From Getty Images. Paris Jackson in Balmain This dress sort of reminds us of when we’re sitting on a couch and take a blanket and wrap it around our body . . . and then stand up with it still wrapped around us. It’s funky! Photo: From Getty Images. Chrissy Teigen This is an edgier (dare we say “goth”?!) look from Teigen, and she looks great. Teigen and Legend always just seem like they’re having a really good time when they go to award shows, don’t they?! Photo: From Getty Images. Celine Dion in Zuhair Murad Dion has received a lot of press lately for her recent vibrant, fresh red-carpet fashion, and this green dress is another stand-out look. (It’s almost like the adult, sophisticated version of the iconic Jennifer Lopez 2000 Grammys dress, no?) Photo: From Getty Images.
