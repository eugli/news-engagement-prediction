However, “public incitement of hatred is defined as everyone who, by communicating statements, promotes hatred against any identifiable group.” \nTherefore, the RCMP said the incident at the centre is considered a hate crime –“mischief to religious property under the Criminal Code of Canada.” \nThe Criminal Code of Canada defines a hate crime as a crime motivated by hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation or any other similar factor. \nREAD MORE: #StopHateAB website tracks hate-related incidents in Alberta \nA man can be seen on camera approaching and leaving from the north, RCMP said. \nThe suspect is described as wearing a hooded sweater and ball cap under a jacket, light coloured pants and dark running shoes. \nAnyone with information on the incident or anyone who recognizes the man is asked to contact Red Deer RCMP at (403) 343-5575. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:16:39.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
