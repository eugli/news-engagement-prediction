He was a star for the Chicago Bulls, who are not the New York Knicks. He was a player and general manager for the Washington Wizards, who are not the New York Knicks. \nBut there was no better person to call in than the GOAT. Here are three reasons why: 1. Jordan and Oakley go way back. \nBefore he became an All-Star with the Knicks, Oakley was Jordan's teammate on the Bulls. More accurately, he was Jordan's \"bodyguard,\" the Marty McSorley to Jordan's Wayne Gretzky. They're only about 11 months apart in age, but Jordan almost seemed to view Oakley as a younger brother in need of his guidance. From a 1986 Chicago Tribune article : \n\"Last week, I asked him what he was doing over the All-Star break,\" Jordan said. \"He didn't know what to do, being a rookie and all. I felt sorry for him. I told him to come with me and that he wouldn't have to pay for anything. I made sure everything was taken care of. He really is a nice guy. I like Charles Oakley. \n\"This will give him something to look forward to in the coming years, a goal for himself. He'll see all the best players in the league, and one day maybe he'll be here playing. It`s an experience, something you can cherish after you get older.\" \nJordan later brought Oakley on as a Wizard at the end of their playing careers and as a Bobcats assistant afterward. He has basically had his back for life. Oakley owes Jordan plenty, and listening to him here was the least he could do. 2. Jordan has become a highly respected voice among owners. \nOnce a laughingstock full of bad basketball decisions, Jordan now presides over a winning team and has a major role in the NBA Board of Governors room. From The Vertical a year ago : \nJordan's emergence on the labor-relations committee - as well as the NBA's competition committee - has strengthened his legitimacy as a league owner. Of course, consensus on a labor deal is a long way away, but those on the sides of the league and union all agree on this: Michael Jordan is a formidable factor in this process. \nDolan, on the other hand, hardly is more of a respected authority with his fellow owners than he is with his fans. In other words, not listening to Jordan would put Dolan at the risk of political damage with the other 28 owners not involved with this decision. 3. You don't mess with Michael Jordan. \nNo one has a greater killer instinct. No one is better at holding a grudge. When Michael Jordan says \"jump,\" you take off from the damn free throw line.
