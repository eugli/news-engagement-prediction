That’s the highest number of people killed by American police in any one month since 2015. And because Trump’s claiming jobs gained for January, and because the major police unions all endorsed Trump, I’m going to go ahead and place this number squarely on his desk. \nWhile January 2017 marked the deadliest month for police brutality since 2015, one thing marks a stark contrast between now and then. Then, we knew the names of the victims and their stories dominated the American media. Now, I’d be hard-pressed to find a single person in this country, outside of a few activists and the families who were affected by this violence, who knows the names and details of a single person killed by American police last month.

(ANDREW HARRER / POOL/EPA) \nRabbis rejoice after getting arrested for NYC travel ban protest \nHaving Donald Trump as the President of the United States is a huge deal, but we cannot afford to divert so much of our attention to him that we neglect people who are suffering and other essential issues. Some of us need to break away from the herd and give issues like police brutality the around-the-clock attention it deserves. If not, the problem will continue to get worse and worse on our watch. \nI want to know what really happened that caused police to shoot and kill 18-year-old Steve Salgado in Santa Ana, Calif. The outrageously generic police statement that “something occurred that led to an officer involved shooting ” (yes, that’s their actual statement) is simply not good enough. The NYPD shot and killed a 28-year-old Jahlire Nicholson, in his own home while he held this screwdriver in his hands. (DCPI) \nI want to know if police right outside of St. Louis were wearing any body cameras when they shot and killed 25-year-old Elijah Smith in his own home last month after his family called 911 for help. Police claimed he lunged at them with a knife and that they had no choice but to kill him, but they seemed to have concealed the shooting from the public until pressed by the local media. Local police appear to have been aware that Smith was having a mental health crisis. Were medical professionals called? \nDid the NYPD really have to shoot and kill another man, 28-year-old Jahlire Nicholson, in his own home over a screwdriver he held in his hands ? \nTrump falsely claims U.S. murder rate is at ‘45 to 47’-year high \nPolice in Hawaii shot and killed an unarmed man last month — claiming he hit the police with a truck. Did witnesses see that? Could the officer have simply gotten out of the way? Was he wearing a body camera? At least 105 people killed were killed by police in the United States during the first month of 2017. (Alex_Schmidt/Getty Images/iStockphoto) \nAn unarmed man, Marcus Jones, who had schizophrenia, was stunned to death in Virginia . His family called 911 for medical help and pleaded with police to treat him humanely. After he was repeatedly shot with a Taser, he died. Did it have to happen like that? \nA Georgia man died after police “sat him on the ground” following a domestic dispute . Did they beat him? Choke him? Or did he just randomly combust? Police have not yet released any details about how he died. \nI could tell you nearly 100 more stories like this — all from people who were killed by police in this country in January alone. I know Trump’s very presence is problematic, but while we monitor him, we cannot afford to lose touch with the issue of police brutality in the process.
