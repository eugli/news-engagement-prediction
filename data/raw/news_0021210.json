He approaches the barrier and picks up one of the wooden bars with his mouth, dropping it on the floor and creating a free passage through the gate. This isn't the first time the clever donkey has been filmed doing this. He approaches the barrier and picks up one of the wooden bars with his mouth, dropping it on the floor and creating a free passage through the gate The problem-solving donkey is called Oreste and has become quite the social media star His owners at Paradise sanctuary in Ronco Scrivia, northern Italy, caught him doing the same thing last month and posted the clip to their Facebook page. The problem-solving donkey is called Oreste and has become quite the social media star. Sanctuary staff say he's much brighter than the other donkeys there. 'Pedro and Domenico jump, Oreste thinks about it a bitâ€¦ and finds another solution.' One viewer of the video wrote: 'Donkeys are intelligent and faithful animals! They become stubborn if they are exposed to violence! 'They have every right to fight back!' And another commented: 'They are much more clever then you think and their memory is excellent.'
