He recently served as spokesman for the National Security Council. Last week, he abruptly quit.\nAnd in a piece he penned for the Washington Post on Monday, Price placed the blame squarely on President Donald Trump .\n‘As intelligence professionals, we’re taught to tune out politics. The river separating CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., from Washington might as well be a political moat. But this administration has flipped that dynamic on its head: The politicians are the ones tuning out the intelligence professionals.’ Edward Price He said he formally resigned after he “reluctantly” concluded he could not continue to serve under the current administration.\nPrice laid out several reasons behind his decision, including Trump’s casting doubt on the “high-confidence conclusion” the intelligence agencies released last month that tied Russia to the hacking and release of the election-related emails.\nPrice also took issue with the fact that Trump often would refer to the flawed 2002 assessment of Iraq’s WMD programs as proof the CIA couldn’t be trusted. He said Trump has persisted “even though the intelligence community had long ago held itself to account for those mistakes and Trump himself supported the invasion of Iraq.”\nFinally, Price said he reached his breaking point when the White House reorganized the National Security Council and added Stephen Bannon to the roster.\n“The public outcry led the administration to reverse course and name the CIA director an NSC principal, but the White House’s inclination was clear. It has little need for intelligence professionals who, in speaking truth to power, might challenge the ‘America First’ orthodoxy that sees Russia as an ally and Australia as a punching bag,” Price wrote.\nMore from MarketWatch Meet Rumor, the 2017 Westminster Dog Show Winner 12 ways to save on your rising grocery bill Flying Drone Taxis Could Take Off in Dubai", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/i-didnt-think-id-ever-leave-the-cia-but-because-of-trump-i-quit/2017/02/20/fd7aac3e-f456-11e6-b9c9-e83fce42fb61_story.html?utm_term=.2fb5f8e891f5"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:37:14.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
