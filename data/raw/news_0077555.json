Like its name suggests, Samsung’s latest Android app was designed as an addition to the Family Hub ecosystem which the South Korean consumer electronics manufacturer initially introduced at Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2016. The Family Hub platform is the company’s first solution for a connected kitchen of the future powered by Samsung’s Internet of Things (IoT) devices like the Family Hub Refrigerator and complimentary software such as the aforementioned app. \nThe Samsung Family Hub app was designed to complement the Family Hub refrigerator lineup made by the Seoul-based company. The same product family was recently expanded with the Family Hub 2.0, Samsung’s latest smart refrigerator that’s meant to be the heart of your Internet-enabled kitchen. The app primarily functions as a tool for updating and controlling your Samsung-made smart fridge though it also ships with some auxiliary functions like the ability to manage your schedule, create shopping lists and all kinds of notes which you can then choose to display on your fridge or just leave them stored in your phone’s memory. The Samsung Family Hub app can also be used to upload pictures to the display of your Family Hub refrigerator, the Seoul-based company says. \nFurthermore, The Samsung Family Hub app features an integrated calendar that serves as a basis for keeping track of your family’s schedule and even boasts a special section dedicated to recipes. Finally, possibly the most interesting feature of Samsung’s latest piece of mobile software is the ability to take a look inside of your refrigerator without actually opening it, regardless of where you are. The Samsung Family Hub app is compatible with most Android devices running Android 4.4 KitKat and newer but can’t be used unless you’ve registered a Family Hub refrigerator with your Samsung account. Furthermore, it seems that the availability of the app is restricted to certain regions seeing how the tool definitely isn’t available in all parts of Europe. You can see some screenshots of the app by referring to the gallery below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:44:59.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
