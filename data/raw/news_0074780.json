The Cardinals swept Omaha this weekend at Jim Patterson Stadium. \nFreshman pitcher Michael McAvene struck out 11 batters in five scoreless innings and picked up his first career victory on Sunday as the Cardinals downed Omaha 6-0 at Jim Patterson Stadium. \nMcAvene made his second career start and scattered four hits. \nNick Bennett pitched two scoreless innings, while Riley Thompson and Shane Hummel had an inning apiece. It was the third shutout in seven games this season for the Cardinals and the four pitchers combined for 15 strikeouts. \nAt the plate, the Cardinals had 12 hits and scored a run in the first, fourth and fifth innings and three in the eighth. \nLogan Taylor had a double and triple and went 3-for-5 with a run scored and three RBIs. \nBrendan McKay went 3-for-4, while Devin Hairston was 2-for-4 and two runs scored and left-fielder Ryan Summers finished 2-for-3 with one RBI and one run scored. McKay is now hitting .619 on the season. \nThe seven-game winning streak to start the season is the longest since 2010 when the Cardinals won their first 13 straight games. The seven-game streak appears to be tied for the second longest to start a season in school history.
