Having suffered from back problems, the former seamer has turned to left-arm chinaman, and claimed a splendid 3-15 off three overs. He then also produced two runouts, as Melville crumbled to be all out in 18.3 overs. \nThen, as if he could smell dinner in the oven, Cooper wasted absolutely no time in getting his troops home, as he smashed an unbeaten 79 off just 26 balls to mow down the target. \nWith a stunning strike rate of 303.85, Cooper smote 13 fours and three sixes - that was 70 runs off 16 balls just there - as he went primarily down the ground, everywhere from over mid-off to over mid-wicket, to wrap things up in just 6.3 overs. \nThe other two matches also produced one-sided affairs, with Old Boys and Marist-Suburbs beating Hamilton Boys' High School and Fraser-Tech, respectively. \nOld Boys eased to a seven-wicket win at the school ground after being set less than three figures. Ad Feedback \nAfter sending HBHS in Old Boys captain Jono McNeill (1-1 off two) struck with the first ball of the match, before Cooper Rowell (3-15 off four) took two in the second over, as the hosts tumbled to a shocking 17-6. \nIn the end Bodie Hodges' 45 not out saw HBHS bat out their overs, but they finished on a lousy 83-9, which Old Boys chased down with 5.1 overs to spare. \nMarist-Suburbs posted the only decent score of the round, notching 161-9 at Galloway Park after choosing to bat, with Peter Bocock (52 off 34, including four fours) and Matt Wallbank (40 off 30, featuring six fours) sharing in a 72-run stand for the fourth wicket to set up the total. \nIn reply Marist-Suburbs' bowlers proved too tough to get away, and Tech fell behind the run rate - just 49-3 at the halfway point. \nRyan Smith, at No 7, gave them hope in smashing 41 off just 16 (four sixes) and taking 23 off off-spinner Gogal Basu in the 15th over, but he was out in the next over, with Tech finishing on 118-9 and going down by 43 runs. \nAT A GLANCE Richard Dodunski Trophy, Rd 1 \nMelville 106 (S Cooper 3-15, T Shuker 2-11) lost to Star University 110-1 (S Cooper 79no) by nine wickets. \nHBHS 83-9 (B Hodges 45no; C Rowell 3-15, S Singh 2-15) lost to Old Boys 84-3 by seven wickets. \nMarist-Suburbs 161-9 (P Bocock 52, M Wallbank 40; S Perera 3-25, J Baker 2-32) beat Fraser-Tech 118-9 (R Smith 41, N Trebilcock 34; K Hill 3-19, A Clare 2-23, G Basu 2-39) by 43 runs. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:51:33.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
