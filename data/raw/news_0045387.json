Finola Hughes has a contract with quite a bit of time left on it, so her death is unlikely. That means her illness is a mechanism to further other plots including her storyline with Valentin (James Patrick Stuart). \nAnna has significant gaps in her memory and this illness might account for some of her selective amnesia. A cure might clear up her recollection of her past with the Cassadine prince. General Hospital spoilers hint that Anna will need a life-saving donation of bone marrow or perhaps a kidney and this will reveal unexpected family. \n— Djona (@djona222) February 18, 2017 Unexpected Family Ties \nGriffin believes his mother to be someone else, not Anna, but that could easily be explained. If Liv was involved in somehow stealing Anna’s baby, she could have placed him for adoption with someone far from Anna. There’s also logic in Griffin being told about Duke as his father since Liv worshipped and adored Duke. \nGeneral Hospital spoilers for March 3 say Robin fears for her mother’s life and will scramble for a solution. Valentin will consent to be tested to donate because he cares deeply about Anna. But when all is said and done, only one donor will match and it won’t be Robin according to GH spoilers. \n— Just Caps (@JustGHcapz) February 18, 2017 Anna And Griffin Need Each Other \nAnna has no family left in Port Charles and Griffin has none at all. General Hospital spoilers for February sweeps tell us Griffin finds himself in an unusual situation and has an interaction that helps him learn more about his father Duke. It could be that him turning up as a bone marrow match for Anna reveals their family connection. \nValentin will be an ongoing factor in Anna’s recovery according to the latest General Hospital spoilers. Griffin doesn’t like his being around since that custody debacle over Charlotte (Scarlett Fernandez). If Griffin turns out to be Anna’s son, that will give the handsome doc greater standing to evict Valentin from Anna’s life. More on Anna’s illness will be revealed as we see more General Hospital spoilers. Is Anna dying?
