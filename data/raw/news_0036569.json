The object is to survive and stay alive. Camera crew are not allowed to intervene unless absolutely necessary for a medical emergency. \nAshley will apparently be heading into the jungle for Season 7 next week. Stay tuned for more details.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:39:34.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
