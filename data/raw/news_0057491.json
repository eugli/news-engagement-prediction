Those details are not clear in video obtained by media outlets. \nHe also said a heavily armed special police force was deployed to the morgue holding Kim Jong Nam's body after police detected an attempt to break into the facility. He declined to give details, but local media reported that a South Korean cameraman was detained briefly outside the morgue after he was found without any identification documents. He was released after a colleague confirmed his identity. \nPolice have already arrested four people in connection with the attack: a Malaysian, a North Korean and the two women – one from Vietnam and the other Indonesian. The Malaysian was to be freed Wednesday on bail, Khalid said. \nPolice are looking for seven other North Korean suspects in connection with the attack, including the two announced Wednesday. The embassy official and the airline employee are among three North Koreans believed to still be at large in Malaysia. \nThe four others are believed to have fled Kuala Lumpur shortly after the attack. Khalid said authorities believe they are back in North Korea, and that they provided the toxin. \n\"That's why we asked the North Korean Embassy to trace them and hand them over to us,\" he said, adding that Malaysian authorities had received no help from North Korea. \nThe case has perplexed toxicologists, who question how the two women could have walked away unscathed after handling a powerful poison. \nKim had spent most of the past 15 years living in China and Southeast Asia. He is believed to have had at least three children with two women. No family members have come forward to claim the body. \nSouth Korea's spy agency believes North Korea was behind the killing, but has produced no evidence. \nNorth Korea has a long history of ordering killings of people it views as threats to its regime. While Kim Jong Nam was not thought to be seeking influence, his position as eldest son of the family that has ruled North Korea since its founding could have made him appear to be a danger. \nHe was at the airport to fly to Macau, where he had a home. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
