Federal regulators later concluded that the explosion could have been prevented if managers had taken into account aging safety equipment and shut down a key, spark-generating part of the refinery before attempting repairs elsewhere. \nThe blast tossed an 80,000-pound piece of equipment within feet of another unit where tens of thousands of pounds of modified hydrofluoric acid were stored in tanks. \nThe U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board concluded that there was a potential to release a toxic cloud and cause \"serious injury or death to many community members.\" \nCalifornia regulators also fined ExxonMobil — then-owner of the refinery — more than $500,000 for safety violations. \nMost of the refinery was shut down for more than a year, leading to a shortage of gas that meets California's stricter pollution regulations and higher prices at the pump. \nTwo other incidents were reported in the fall of 2015. One involved a leak of modified hydrofluoric acid and the other a leak in a pressurized pipe that created a large steam cloud. No injuries were reported. \nThe refinery sits on 750 acres and produces 1.8 billion gallons of gasoline a year, which accounts for about 8.3 percent of the state's total refining capacity.
