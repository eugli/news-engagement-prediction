Malcolm Turnbull sets up new politicians' expenses authority – politics live Read more \nThe only “zombie” measure not contained in the bill was the government’s plan to increase the pension age to 70, the Australian Financial Review reported . \nUnder the proposed change, announced in the 2014 budget, people born after 1 January 1966 would have to work until they are 70 before they are eligible for pension. \nGuardian Australia has confirmed that lifting the pension age remains Coalition policy but the government did not include it because budget savings would not flow until 2025 and it did not want to risk the whole package when it could push for the measure separately at a later date. \nAsked on ABC’s AM on Thursday why the government had omitted the pension change from the omnibus bill, Joyce said the public wanted the government to negotiate and that’s what it was doing. \nAsked specifically about whether it would change pension policy, Joyce replied: “We have our policy but we are negotiating with the Senate as we always do.” \nJoyce said the government proposed the change because it had inherited debt from the previous Labor government. \nOn Thursday, the shadow social services minister, Jenny Macklin, said that it was “not good enough” to put the pension age change on hold and called for the government to axe it entirely. \n“Labor has strongly opposed the planned increase to the pension age to 70 since it was first proposed in the horror 2014 budget,” she said. “How does Mr Turnbull expect construction workers, nurses and farmers to work until they’re 70? He’s completely out of touch.
