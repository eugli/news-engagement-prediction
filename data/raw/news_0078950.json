GETTY It is no surprise that confidence in the government is low when this is how they spend their money \nHe was born Ronald Fiddler in Manchester to Jamaican parents. Known as Ronnie, he enjoyed football, table tennis and karate. \nHe went to college on a computing and religious studies course and there he made friends who were Muslims. \nThe advocacy group Cage (remember they saw Jihadi John as a “beautiful young man”) reported the catalyst for his conversion to Islam was reading a book on American Islamist Malcolm X. \nHaving converted to Islam he became known as Jamal al-Harith and dropped off the radar until he was found languishing in a jail in Afghanistan. \nSubsequently shipped to Guantanamo Bay, he was held without charge for two years during which he claimed he was mistreated. GETTY Al-Harith spent two years in Guantanamo bay, where he claimed he was mistreated \nWith the queue of bleeding heart lawyers stretching round the block, the lobbying for his release grew apace. \nHis cause was championed, among others, by David Blunkett and Tony Blair. This one was missed by Lily Allen but you have to assume that she might be happy to still play catch-up. \nIn March 2004 he arrived back in Britain and the usual suspects of gullible British media fawned over the terrorist and ensured his unfathomable parcel of cobblers was beamed to the largest possible audience. \nNot once did any of these easily duped incompetents think to challenge him on the “rap sheet” prepared by US security authorities. \nHis file clearly stated he was deemed “a high threat to the US, its interests and allies”. \nIt showed he was linked to a “well-known Al Qaeda operative” and when asked the name of the school in the Sudan at which he claimed to have been a teacher for five years he could not remember. \nDon’t know about you but I’m certain I could recall the name of anyone who had given me a job for five years without the need for waterboarding. \nHis time in the Sudan also coincided with time spent there by Osama Bin Laden. By now, most of you would probably agree he was someone worth monitoring. \nNot so though for our politicians. David Blunkett said at the time he posed no threat to this country. \nThis killer received compensation because it was feared taking him to trial could compromise intelligence and expose state secrets. This must never be allowed to happen again. \nAn independent panel of judges must be appointed so a case involving the most sensitive security intelligence can be heard but – and far more importantly – we must never again give an amount of money beyond the dreams of most of us to those who would slit our throats, and those of the ones we love, as soon as look at us. GETTY Now that Claudio Ranieri has been sacked, Leicester face an uphill struggle to avoid relegation Et tu, Kante? \nTo be a Leicester City fan (as I have been for half a century) last year was an absolute joy. \nNot only did the team play consistently well and break every record going, they swiftly became many football, and possibly even any sports, fan’s favourite second side. \nAs other teams fell by the wayside they all chorused as one that they hoped Leicester would pull it off and win the Premier League title. \nIt was like you became everyone’s best mate. As you all know, the fairytale came true and they were crowned champions. \nHowever, now manager Claudio Ranieri has been so ruthlessly sacked the board has set up a unique follow-up to that love affair. \nSadly, many fans of other teams will now want to see Leicester lose their relegation battle as, clearly, the players are as much to blame as the beleaguered coach who was treated so badly. \nPlus, if Leicester are relegated the team’s own fans will turn on the board. It’s a trap only the most cunning of Foxes can escape. Britain loves a shabby dog story \nTwo brilliantly shabbily dressed, slobby men were in the headlines last week. \nOne is Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who opted to channel the bag lady look and go jogging dressed as if he had stepped out of a charity shop. \nThe other was Sutton United football team’s reserve goalkeeper Wayne Shaw, who found the final whistle had been blown on his extensive football career as a result of being shown eating a pie on TV while his team went down valiantly in an FA Cup tie against Arsenal. \nWhat unites this unlikely pair is simple: we love the dishevelled underdog. \nJust as we are sick of politicians whose images are as shiny as a Buckingham Palace guard’s shoe and are equally appalled by posing football “superstars” who earn more in a month than a nurse might in a lifetime but go over like a granny on an icy morning if anyone even looks at them the wrong way, we celebrate unreservedly those who buck the system.
