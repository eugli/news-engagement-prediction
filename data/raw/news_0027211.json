The smart money remains on Ibrahimovic sticking around for another season and United crave that, given the way he interacted with Anthony Martial on Saturday. Ibrahimovic pats Juan Mata on the back after the Spaniard's vital contribution on Saturday SUPER STAT Anthony Martial has been involved in more Premier League goals (22) for United than any other player since his debut. Martial sits beside Ibrahimovic for breakfast at Carrington and the pair have talked through the youngster's troubles under Mourinho, magnified by a lack of consecutive starts since early December and intermittent public criticism. Something looked to have clicked against Watford, Martial often releasing the handbrake to fly at the unfortunate Craig Cathcart, and on occasions even tracking back. A weight seemed to have been lifted, and Mourinho was visibly encouraged in his technical area and warmly embracing Martial when he was taken off to a standing ovation late on. 'He seems to do OK,' Ibrahimovic added. 'He's not going around with his head down. He's positive, training hard and has a lot of energy. Obviously he wants to play. Ibrahimovic says he will make a decision on whether he stays on for another season at United Martial provided one goal and laid on an assist as United recorded a routine win over Watford 'He's not a guy who speaks a lot, he's pretty quiet. He hasn't played a lot but when he has he's done well.' Martial certainly did, laying on Juan Mata's opener before scoring himself. The cool finish after half-time was his 24th in a United shirt since last season's £36million switch from Monaco. One more goal and United will need to pay Monaco around £8million extra as part of the huge financial package which includes the same fee when the Frenchman reaches 25 caps. Luke Shaw will certainly have watched Martial's afternoon with interest. It served as proof that anyone can claw a way back into Mourinho's plans. Luke Shaw (far right) is hoping to fight his way back into Jose Mourinho's first team plans Shaw, whose only appearance since November came against Wigan in the FA Cup, partly down to injury, really needs his fortunes to turn soon. 'He has to work and wait,' Mourinho said of Shaw. 'He is fighting hard. There is no problem with him. I wanted one defender on the bench and the defender is someone who can play in more than one position. 'Matteo Darmian can play left back, right back and an emergency central defender for us, so my choice was Darmian. Luke doesn't have any problem.' Working well, maybe, but there cannot be many other £27m players so peripheral throughout world football. At least Martial is back firing, but United's worry is that Ibrahimovic, their superstar freebie, holds all the contract cards.
