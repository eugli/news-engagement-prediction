Though his flow was a bit wack, people loved it all the same. There‚Äôs a rap category on Jeopardy, and Alex Trebek‚Äôs got BARS. pic.twitter.com/W5NGCBREdf ‚Äî Justin Ferguson (@JFergusonAU) February 21, 2017 Here‚Äôs Alex Trebek rapping on @Jeopardy for those of you not watching üòÇ pic.twitter.com/FANczhVSl7 ‚Äî Dennis üèç (@TheBurghMenace) February 21, 2017 \nNow, Trebek‚Äôs Canadian old man flow has been synced up to the songs he was actually quoting from. The results, which have been manipulated so as to not sound totally horrible, are actually fairly mesmerizing. If Jeopardy! ever tanks, perhaps there‚Äôs a future for Trebek in the rap game. I took Alex Trebek rapping on Jeopardy and did the only thing that felt right: Edit it to the music he was quoting.
