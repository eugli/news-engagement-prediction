Texas originally intended to boot Planned Parenthood in January but Sparks told the state to wait pending his ruling. \nArkansas, Alabama, Kansas, Mississippi and Louisiana have also had similar efforts blocked. \nLike in those states, Texas health officials accused Planned Parenthood officials of making misrepresentation to investigators following the release of secretly recorded and heavily edited videos by an anti-abortion group last year. Investigations by 13 states into those videos have concluded without criminal charges, and Planned Parenthood officials have denied any wrongdoing. \nA Houston grand jury indicted two activists behind the videos over how they covertly gained access inside a Planned Parenthood clinic, but a judge later dismissed the charges. \nPlanned Parenthood serves only a fraction of the 4.3 million people enrolled in Medicaid in Texas. \nAnti-abortion activists emboldened by a new Trump administration are looking for the federal government to cut off all federal funding to Planned Parenthood. That would cut nearly $400 million in Medicaid money to the group and result in roughly 400,000 women losing access to care, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. \nIn one of his first acts as president, Trump last month banned U.S. funding to international groups that perform abortions or even provide information about abortions. Vice President Mike Pence strongly opposes abortion, citing his Catholic beliefs, and the newly confirmed health secretary, Tom Price, has supported cutting off taxpayer money to Planned Parenthood. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:36:13.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
