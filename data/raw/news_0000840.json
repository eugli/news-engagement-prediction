Picture: Melvyn Knipe Eliza Barr Liverpool Leader Share on Twitter \nHUGHES federal Liberal MP Craig Kelly has refused to denounce US President Donald Trump’s controversial attempt to block citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. \nLarge protests have erupted at several American airports after Mr Trump issued the 90-day ban, forcing several travellers to be detained until judges blocked the visa suspension. \nMr Kelly’s southern Sydney electorate, which includes suburbs such as Wattle Grove, Hammondville and Holsworthy, is home to more than 1000 people born in the countries on Mr Trump’s banned list: Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. \n“The important thing is not to call this a Muslim ban as some have done – the ban relates to people from those countries whether they are Muslim or not,” Mr Kelly said. \n“Referring to it as a Muslim ban is stirring up division and hatred in countries across the world.” President-elect Donald Trump walks through the Crypt at the Capitol in Washington.

Scott Applewhite, Pool) Source: AP \nMr Kelly acknowledged his constituents may have concerns about the widely criticised visa suspension, but said every country was entitled to make its own rules. \n“Any dual passport holder – anyone who holds a valid Australian passport – is not affected by the United States’ temporary suspension,” Mr Kelly said. \n“The reality is that every country has the right to determine what visa policy they will have.” \nHowever, Mr Kelly insisted he had “great compassion” for the people from countries on Mr Trump’s banned list, who had not been allowed to enter the United States under his executive order. \n“We’ve seen a tragedy in Syria,” Mr Kelly said. \n“I couldn’t think of anything worse and I would be doing everything I could to resettle my family in a Western democracy as well.” \nPROTESTS OVER TRUMP’S TRAVEL BAN SPREADS WORLDWIDE VARIOUS US: Protests Over Trump's Travel Ban Spreads Worldwide Various 0:57 \nCities around the world joined protests against President Donald Trump after his recent travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries.
