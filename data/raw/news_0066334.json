I was shocked to see the shoddy preparations he made for Congress electioneering. It convinced me that he was working to ensure the worst defeat for the party. I had told many colleagues in private that we would barely cross 30 seats and I’m not surprised by the result.” \n\nOn Nirupam’s allegations that senior Congress leaders did not cooperate with him, Kamat said, “People like me who have spent our entire political life working for Congress, don’t need lessons from a Johnny come lately like Sanjay Nirupam. Never in my 40 years’ association with the Congress has anyone accused me of indulging in anti-party activities. There have been many Congress presidents in Mumbai who had different wavelengths with colleagues, but none has constantly insulted Congress leaders and workers of Mumbai as Nirupam.” \n\nA former chief of Mumbai Congress himself, Kamat accused Nirupam of misleading the leadership. “About four weeks back, Nirupam came told me the party was in for a big defeat and that I should help him out. I assured him of all help, including campaigning. Yet in a week, I was shocked to see Nirupam telling Rahulji straight face, during our meeting, ‘I (Nirupam) will deliver Mumbai for Congress’. Later, I asked him what had changed in a week for him to make such a false claim before Rahulji.” Kamat questioned Nirupam’s ideological compatibility and presentability to lead Congress and inspire workers. “Who doesn’t know Nirupam’s ideological baggage? Who in Mumbai can forget the rabidly communal rants he made against minority community members? He even had the audacity to commission an article in a Congress publication which shockingly insulted the family of the Congress president. That was the kind of cheap stuff he had been writing in Shiv Sena and RSS mouthpieces when he worked for them,” Kamat alleged.
