Before he took to the stage, Sting, 65, made use of Joe’s shoulder for a bit of shut-eye. Sumner, who graduated in environmental science from Richmond, the American International University in London, plays in rock band Fiction Plane. Sting has four children by his second wife, Trudie Styler. ‘For me to be on this tour is easy because I have the connections,’ admits Joe. ‘But the emotional work I had to do to get to the place where I was OK with it was not easy.’ It’s a hard life.

Broadcaster Mariella Frostrup, 54, has joined the backlash against the much hyped multi-Oscar-nominated musical La La Land, co-starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. ‘This one-tune wonder with a couple of derivative dance numbers set in the world of make-believe they call Hollywood has to be one of the most banal movies of recent decades,’ she says. ‘If this forgettable musical scoops more awards than any other film in history, it will only confirm our desperation to escape the precarious real world. ‘I suspect that if it does triumph on both sides of the Atlantic, we’ll look back and shake our heads in wonder at our own crazy choices.’ RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T11:59:44.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
