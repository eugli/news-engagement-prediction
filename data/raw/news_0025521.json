Despite there being no Government majority in the Upper House and the fact most peers are pro-EU, the Brexit Bill will make it through. \nWhy? Because the reason this unelected chamber still exists in the 21st century it that it has a very strong self-preservation instinct. It knows how far it can push things. 7 If the House of Lords will not block Brexit and risk being abolished \nTo obstruct something backed by 17.4million people in a referendum and which just got a House of Commons majority of 372, would be suicidal — and the Lords know it. \nCabinet ministers admit initial Government talk of abolishing the House of Lords if it didn’t vote for Article 50 was “over the top”. \nBut the reason David Davis and Theresa May have been using much softer language in the past few days is because they are confident the Lords won’t do anything stupid. PA 7 David Davis has softened his tone over the Upper Chamber recently \nIndeed, I understand the Labour front bench has made clear, through the usual channels, that they aren’t interested in trying to wreck the bill. \nThis doesn’t mean there won’t be attempts to fiddle with it. \nBut as one Cabinet minister notes, the fact the Commons passed it without any amendments “puts a massive pressure” on peers to do the same. \nAnother minister points out the Government defeated all the amendments in the Commons with ease, May’s majority never dipped below 30. \nThis means she would have the votes to strip any amendments out if the Bill was sent back to the Commons. AP:Associated Press Prime Minister Theresa May faces the challenge of when to tell the EU Britain is off \nThe exception to the Lords’ sense of self-preservation is the Liberal Democrats. \n“The Lib Dems would love to try to create a constitutional crisis,” warns one senior figure in the Brexit department, pointing out that they are pro-EU and anti-Lords. \nBut independent peers, whose support is key to defeating the Government, will be put off by the Lib Dems’ attitude. They don’t want to bring the House down. \nOnce Theresa May has got her Brexit Bill through Parliament, she faces the diplomatic challenge of working out when it is best to formally tell the EU that Britain is off.

Miliband hopes to land top UN role but UK Government has other ideas WORD has it that David Miliband wants to run the UN Development ­Programme. \nMiliband, who is currently earning more than £400,000 a year heading the International Rescue Committee, is keen on this top UN post. However, I understand he will emphatically not get the backing of the UK Government, who have their eyes on securing another role for Britain. Without London’s support, Miliband is almost certain not to get the gig ‘Irritating’ Bercow’s warning \nJOHN BERCOW will survive the attempt to remove him as Speaker of the House of Commons following his unbecoming rant against Donald Trump . \nThe SNP and Labour benches are still behind him and Theresa May, in the words of one Cabinet ­minister, “wants Government to keep a million miles away from this”. \nA senior Government source predicts the matter won’t even come to a vote. PA:Press Association 7 John Bercow will survive this motion of no confidence \nAs one Cabinet minister points out, Bercow isn’t the resigning type – so there’s little point in a vote he would win. \nHowever, senior Tory MPs think that sufficient Tory MPs will sign the early day motion expressing no confidence in him to send a shot across Bercow’s bow. John Bercow says he's strongly opposed to Donald Trump addressing MPs in the Commons \nEven among those on the Tory side who had previously supported him, there is real irritation about his behaviour – his failure to canvass opinion across the House before sounding off from the chair about Trump, or to communicate his concerns to the ­Government in private before going public. \nIf Bercow attempts to stay on past next year when he has promised to step down, there’ll be more trouble. \nOne senior Tory backbencher warns Bercow’s position will be made “untenable” Clive Lewis is the first Labour MP to challenge Corbyn but none are backing him LABOUR MPs have been praying for someone who might be able to beat ­Jeremy Corbyn with the ­membership. \nBut now someone has ­presented himself, they are running a mile. Clive Lewis, below, who resigned from the Shadow Cabinet this week, would have a far better chance than anyone else of defeating Corbyn. He was an enthusiastic backer of Corbyn’s 2015 leadership bid and is a genuine Lefty, in tune with the new membership. He is pro-EU like they are, more charismatic than Corbyn and would offer Labour the chance to make history with the first party leader from a visible ethnic minority. But senior Labour figures are dismissive. One tells me Lewis has “no MP backers, no union backers”. For this reason, it’s virtually impossible to see how he could get the 35 parliamentary nominations needed to stand for leader. So, Corbyn will carry on Tories optimistic for historic vote \nTHERESA MAY is hitting the campaign trail. \nNext week, she is expected to go to Copeland in Cumbria ahead of the by-election there in 12 days’ time. \nMay’s decision to make such a high-profile visit so close to polling day is a statement of intent. \nIt shows how seriously the Tories are taking this long-shot effort to win a seat that Labour held with a 2,500 vote majority at the General ­Election. EPA If the Tories triumph in Copeland it will be seen as a coup \nIf the Tories do triumph, it would be a major upset. \nThe seat has been Labour since 1931 and a governing party hasn’t gained a seat in a by-election for 30-odd years when the Tories won a seat from Labour in the middle of the Falklands War, with the previous Labour MP standing for the SDP. \nBut the Tories are becoming increasingly optimistic they might just pull off a ­historic result. \n“One good thing you can do is mention the PM, then the even better thing to do is mention Jeremy Corbyn,” says one of those involved in the campaign. \nIf the Tories do take ­Copeland, it’ll make Labour MPs even more crestfallen. \nExpect to see more of them following the lead of the departed MP for Copeland, Jamie Reed, and heading off for jobs outside politics. \nAfter all, what’s the point in sticking around when your party is going backwards?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:39:26.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
