More recently, reigning Enduro Cup champ Alex Premat lobbed from France with extensive GP2 and LMP1 sports car racing on his resume. \nBut the driver that has achieved the most success in Supercars despite carving their career out racing internationally? \nHe was born in Penrith. \nWith 15 race wins, 10 pole positions and victory in the 2010 championship, James Courtney is the best performing Supercars driver to have grown up racing outside of our shores. \nHis karting world championship wins as a teen put him on the path towards F1, meaning all his junior racing came in Britain, the European mainland and Japan.

Source: News Corp Australia \nWhen Courtney arrived in Australia for his maiden Supercars season in 2006 he had zero experience of Australian tracks — bar Sandown and Mount Panorama — and no experience in sedan racing with cars as heavy as the beefy V8-powered Fords and Holdens. \nBut it wasn’t the cars or the close-quarters racing that Courtney found most difficult to figure out. \nIt was the round, black things that connected the cars to the road. Courtney scored four podiums as a rookie in 2006, two coming at his team’s test track. Source: News Corp Australia \n“For me (it was) the tyre,” Courtney told foxsports.com.au. “It was so vague. It doesn’t give you any information back. \n“It’s like cutting some of your senses out. It’s like you’ve got all your senses but (then) you can’t see or hear.” \nIt is adapting to the tyre that Courtney expects will prove the biggest mountain for rookie De Silvestro to climb. \n“I think that will definitely be the thing for her,” he said. \n“Especially with IndyCar and the other championships she’s run previously — high grip. Coming to these, it can be a big step. De Silvestro on her way to second place at the 2013 Houston IndyCar GP. Source: Supplied \n“(For me) it was very hard coming from such high-grip categories that I was racing before in Europe that were so tyre dependent and with so much tyre development. \n“You learn to drive the car on the tyre and get so much feeling back to make your decisions. \n“With these cars, because they’re so big and heavy and the tyre’s so baggy, you lose about 90 per cent of the tools that you use to make decisions to drive the car. That makes it a lot harder. \n“I think if you grew up through the racing here, you’d learn to drive without the grip and with the heavier cars and that sort of stuff. It makes the transition to Supercars a lot easier.” \nAnd the hardest track to learn? According to Courtney, De Silvestro is in for a baptism of fire on the Adelaide streets. \n“The hardest one I think will be this one,” he said. \n“Not so much learning the track, but the race weekend with two 250-kilometre races, the heat, the pressure, not racing throughout the off-season — it is the hardest race, easily, all year. This will be the killer.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
