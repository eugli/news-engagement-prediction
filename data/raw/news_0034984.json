'Horrific attack' \nWhen she woke up, the men were gone and her jewellery had been taken. \nShe received medical treatment but was not taken to hospital. \nThe man in the e-fit is white, in his late 20s or 30-years-old, of skinny build, 5ft 10in, clean shaven and described as having a \"very distinct large nose\".
