Melinda Logan said. \"Without regard for their safety, they came in and rescued the trooper until he was able to gain control of the suspects and place them under arrest. \nRelated news: Michigan State police dog bites suspect who kicked his head \n\"Without them, I don’t know what would have happened to the trooper.\" \nMichigan State Police plan to somehow recognize Burnham and the man from Plainwell, who asked police not to release his identity, Logan said. \nThe two suspects — brothers Michael Scott Barber, 21, of Gobles, Mich. and Travis Taylor Wise, 19, of Middlebury, Ind. — were arraigned today on multiple felony counts. \nAccording to state police, Guild tried to stop a motorcycle that Barber was driving south on U.S. 31 Bypass near Matthew Road for speeding Monday morning. Barber began to stop but then accelerated and re-entered the freeway, police said. \n\"After a three-mile pursuit, the driver attempted to maneuver in the gore of the exit ramp and lost control. After crashing, the driver quickly returned to his feet and charged toward Tpr. Guild,\" according to a news release from State Police. \nGuild was wrestling with Barber, police said, when a vehicle stopped and Wise ran out toward the trooper and started attacking him. Wise was attempted to choke Guild while Barber punched him in the face, according to police. \nLogan said the Plainwell man stopped his vehicle first and pulled Barber away from the trooper and threw him on the ground. He next pulled Wise off the trooper. \nBurnham then stopped his vehicle and helped pin Wise down so the trooper could arrest Barber, police said. Both suspects were taken into custody. Burnham could not immediately be reached for comment today. \nGuild was treated for minor injuries at a local hospital and released. Authorities say the motorcycle was stolen from Van Buren County. \nBarber and Wise were arraigned in Berrien County on charges of assault strangulation, a 10-year-felony; attempting to disarm a police officer, a two-year felony; and resisting and obstructing a police officer causing injury, a four-year felony. \nBarber was also charged with third-degree fleeing and eluding and receiving and concealing a stolen vehicle, both five-year felonies. Additionally, Wise was charged with obstruction of justice, a five-year felony. \nBond was set at $100,000 cash or surety for Wise and $75,000 cash or surety for Barber. A pre-exam conference and preliminary exam hearing are scheduled for March 1 and March 7, respectively, at Berrien County Trial Court in Niles. \nBoth men have asked for court-appointed attorneys. As of mid-afternoon today, no attorneys were listed for them in court records. \nContact staff writer Ann Zaniewski at 313-222-6594 or azaniewski@freepress.com.
