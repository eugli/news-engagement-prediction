(Supplied: The Australian Museum) \nAs well as bestowing him with its highest honour of Lifetime Patron, the Australia Museum has named this mollusc, found only in south-eastern Tasmania, after Sir David. \nAttenborougharion rubicundus is also known as the Burgundy Snail, but is actually a semi-slug — a snail with a shell so small it cannot retract into it. \nThe animal is bright green and bright red and about 40 millimetres in length. \nAustralian Museum Trust president Catherine Livingstone AO said Sir David had \"no peer\" in his contribution to the natural world. \n\"Australia and the international community have benefited from your curiosity, knowledge, and unending commitment to the natural world to bring us the stories, and make us aware of the challenges we face, in a way that no one else has been able to do,\" she said. A possum-like prehistoric lion \nLast year the fossil of an extinct marsupial lion unearthed in remote north-west Queensland was named after Sir David. \nA team of palaeontologists found some of the animal's teeth exposed on a small block of limestone, understood to be about 18 million years old. \n\"Teeth can tell you an awful lot about an animal,\" Anna Gillespie from the University of New South Wales said. \n\"I would have thought it would have been very possum-like, like a small ringtail possum or even one of the small climbing carnivorous marsupials that live today.\" \nThe marsupial, formally named Microleo attenboroughi , is on display at the Queensland Museum. Sir David's long-beaked echidna \nAlso known as Attenborough's long-beaked echidna or the Cyclops long-beaked echidna, this critically endangered echidna is found in the Cyclops Mountains in the Indonesian province of Papua. \nThese solitary animals — they only meet with their own kind once a year to mate — are considered by locals to be a delicacy. \nHunting, as well as habitat loss, has put the species in danger of extinction, and indeed for some time it was feared the echidna may have been completely stamped out. \nBut in 2007 researchers found tracks and burrows thought to be those of the echidna, and communication with local people has indicated the species may have been seen as recently at 2005. A tiny goblin spider \nIn 2012, a new species of spider found only on one island in Queensland was named after Sir David . \nThe goblin spider, formally known as Prethopalpus attenboroughi ,is just over one millimetre in length and found only on Horn Island in the Torres Strait in Queensland. \nIt was discovered and described by Queensland Museum research fellow Barbara Baehr and WA Museum head of terrestrial zoology Mark Harvey. \nSir David visited Perth to be presented with a framed photograph and a signed publication of the species at the WA Museum.

The world's oldest 'mother fish' Photo: Materpiscis attenboroughi was found at the Gogo Formation in Western Australia. (Supplied: Museum Victoria) \nMaterpiscis attenboroughi — \"Attenborough's mother fish\" — is the oldest known vertebrate to give birth to live young. \nThe only specimen we know of was found at the Gogo Formation in Western Australia, and highlighted by Sir David in his 1979 series Life on Earth. \nFor that reason the \"mother fish\" was named after Sir David, with more than 50 species of fish having been described from the formation. \nMaterpiscis attenboroughi was found in 2005 with an embryo attached to its mother by an umbilical cord, meaning before the fish died it was set to become a mum — some 380 million years ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:34:33.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
