Photo: Angela Wylie \nSome initiatives are not up and running after 16 months. \nSilma Ihram, a Muslim educator who was consulted as part of the 2015 response, said she was alarmed that law enforcement measures, such as tougher parole laws and criminal punishment, seem to have been implemented much faster than measures to help the community.
